5|$|Some bioethicists deem it {{reasonable}} {{for parents to}} select a child who would have the highest well-being. One criticism of this reasoning is that it often values those with disabilities less. Some parents argue that Down syndrome shouldn't be prevented or cured and that eliminating Down syndrome amounts to genocide. The disability rights movement {{does not have a}} position on screening, although some members consider testing and abortion discriminatory. Some in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>who</b> are pro-life support abortion if the fetus is disabled, while others do not. Of a group of 40 mothers in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>who</b> have had one child with Down syndrome, half agreed to screening in the next pregnancy.|$|E

5|$|The Ryder Cup is a golf {{competition}} contested by {{teams from}} Europe and the United States. The competition was originally contested between Great Britain and the United States, Republic of Ireland golfers first {{played in the}} British team in 1953 and this was extended to golfers elsewhere in Europe in 1979. Established in 1927, the competition is jointly administered by the Professional Golfers' Association of America (PGA of America) and Ryder Cup Europe, a venture in which the PGA European Tour is the primary partner. The competition takes place every two years, {{with the exception of}} 2001 when the match was played a year later due to the 11 September attacks; the venue alternates between courses in Europe and the United States. The winners of the first match were the <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>who</b> defeated Great Britain at Worcester Country Club 9½–2½.

Working in Malawi, MacKinnon is struck by the contrast between their western diet and that of the poor country's: there is ample food supplies in Malawi but most is exported to Canada and the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>who</b> buy the food they do not require. The couple learn about Mexican and Maya cuisine while in Merida, Mexico for a wedding. The book ends with an epilogue, written by both Smith and MacKinnon six months after their one-year diet. They make a symbolic journey to Bamfield, within their 100-mile radius, to collect sea water for its salt and prove they could obtain their own salt supply.|$|E

5|$|Ireland once {{dominated}} the world's market for whiskey, producing 90% of the world's whiskey {{at the start}} of the 20th century. However, as a consequence of bootleggers during the prohibition in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> (<b>who</b> sold poor-quality whiskey bearing Irish-sounding names thus eroding the pre-prohibition popularity for Irish brands) and tariffs on Irish whiskey across the British Empire during the Anglo-Irish Trade War of the 1930s, sales of Irish whiskey worldwide fell to a mere 2% by the mid-20th century. In 1953, an Irish government survey, found that 50 per cent of whiskey drinkers in the United States had never heard of Irish whiskey.|$|E
5|$|Martina's {{participation}} in the 200m finals round was controversial. Martina came in second place to Usain Bolt, completing the event in 19.82 seconds over Usain Bolt's world-record breaking performance of 19.30 seconds. However, when American would-be bronze medalist Wallace Spearmon was disqualified for running outside of his lane, the American coaches reviewed video records of the race and found that Martina had done the same. The United States filed a protest against the Netherlands Antilles. The Dutch Antillean Olympic committee argued that the challenge was invalid, having been filed after the 30-minute post-race deadline, but Martina was disqualified from receiving the silver medal anyway. Shawn Crawford of the <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>who</b> originally finished the race in fourth place, was given the silver medal, and Walter Dix was given the bronze medal in place of Spearmon.|$|E

5|$|The United States Cabinet has had 22 African-American {{appointed}} officers. The US Census Bureau defines African Americans {{as citizens}} or {{residents of the}} <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>who</b> have origins {{in any of the}} black populations of Africa. The term is generally used for Americans with at least partial ancestry in any of the original peoples of sub-Saharan Africa. During the founding of the federal government, African Americans were consigned to a status of second-class citizenship or enslaved. No African American ever held a Cabinet position before the Civil Rights Movement or the signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned discrimination in public accommodations, employment, and labor unions.|$|E
5|$|The list {{of names}} {{consists}} of entries from 17 Southeast and East Asian nations and the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>who</b> have territories directly affected by typhoons. The submitted names are arranged into five lists, and each list is cycled with each year. Unlike tropical cyclones {{in other parts of}} the world, typhoons are not named after people. Instead, they generally refer to animals, flowers, astrological signs, and a few personal names. However, PAGASA retains its own naming list, which does consist of human names. Therefore, a typhoon can possibly have two names. Storms that cross the date line from the central Pacific retain their original name, but the designation of hurricane becomes typhoon. In Japan, people use the numerical designation of typhoons according to the sequence of their occurrence in the calendar year.|$|E

5|$|According to the indictment, {{the crime}} {{organization}} headed by Itzhak and Meir Abergil ran a flourishing money-laundering {{business in the}} US from 2002 to 2006, processing {{tens of millions of}} dollars of funds embezzled from the Israel Trade Bank, through the “Jerusalem Gang′s” extortion of Ofer Maximov, that led to his sister Etti Alon′s embezzling 250 million shekel. The money was given out as loans to Israeli businesspeople in the <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>who</b> were later extorted to give up their businesses if they did not pay up. Meir Abergil, described as the person in charge of finances, collected the money that was exacted and later laundered and invested it. Gabi Ben Harosh of the “Jerusalem Gang” who was arrested in Los Angeles in 2004, ran the lending bank in the United States and updated Meir and Itzhak Abergil on its balance. Sasson Barashi of Jerusalem and Hai Vaknin of Los Angeles identified borrowers and businesses and also saw to the collection of the money. Yoram Elal, who has fled to Brazil, was responsible for special-operations. The activities have been documented in hundreds of surveillance reports, photographs and phone calls, which were recorded by police departments all over the world and are detailed in the indictment.|$|E
5|$|Canada's {{military}} involvement in Afghanistan began in 2002 with the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), a coalition of soldiers from 42 countries, which was tasked as a counterinsurgency effort {{in response to the}} September 11 attacks. ISAF had initially been established as a stabilization force by the United Nations Security Council on 20 December 2001, to secure Kabul. The Canadian Liberal government at the time, under Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, chose to have the Canadian Forces (CF) hand over its prisoners to the <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>who</b> led the fight against al-Qaeda and other insurgents. After NATO took command of Afghanistan in 2003, Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse {{at the hands of the}} United States armed forces in Iraq came to the attention of the public, and Canada soon faced pressure to hand their prisoners to someone else. Canada entered into an agreement with the Afghan government and started transferring detainees to Afghan security forces, which comprised the Afghan National Army (ANA) and the Afghan National Directorate of Security (NDS).|$|E
