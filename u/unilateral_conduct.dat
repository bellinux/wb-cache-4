40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present thesis is to analyse the {{relationship}} between competition law and economics on the example of the USA and the EU. In the first chapter is mentioned the context that led to the issuance of antitrust laws in the USA, the EU and other countries, as well as the most significant economic theories which had a major influence on the application of competition law. This is followed by the description of the institutional framework of competition law in the USA and the EU, their respective primary sources of law, including non-legislative documents. The second chapter analyses the most significant anticompetitive conducts for both antitrust areas (i. e. anticompetitive agreements and <b>unilateral</b> <b>conducts),</b> with a special attention to the most harmful anticompetitive conducts (e. g. horizontal price fixing) and to relatively new and dynamically developing areas of antitrust law (e. g. refusal to deal related to intellectual property). Each selected conduct is introduced by the description of potential anticompetitive effects of the conduct and it is followed by relevant significant American and European precedents. The last sub-chapters analyse non-legislative documents issued by the FTC, DoJ and EC which enable to educe their current general approach to mergers...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{question}} how <b>unilateral</b> <b>conduct</b> can create, vary or discharge obligations in English private law and how <b>unilateral</b> <b>conduct</b> is regulated. First, it is {{explained that the}} reason for asking this question follows from the candidate’s background in a civil law jurisdiction, in which unilateral juridical acts are regarded a category of legally relevant behaviour. After observing the obstacles in English law to the recognition of the civil law concept of unilateral juridical acts, a number of examples of <b>unilateral</b> <b>conduct</b> are identified that create legal effect. The focus of the thesis is on examples of <b>unilateral</b> <b>conduct</b> that create, vary or discharge obligations. English law allows the creation of obligations by <b>unilateral</b> <b>conduct</b> only in very specific instances. It is observed that <b>unilateral</b> <b>conduct</b> can create or transfer property rights. The different approach is explained primarily by deeply rooted distinction in English law between words and acts. Subsequently, the thesis discusses how <b>unilateral</b> <b>conduct</b> is regulated. For some issues, notably interpretation, revocability and the intention to create legal effect, similar rules apply to the different examples of <b>unilateral</b> <b>conduct.</b> For other issues, especially mistake and form requirements, the rules diverge. It is concluded that <b>unilateral</b> <b>conduct</b> forms a category of legally relevant behaviour in English law. This category is divided in <b>unilateral</b> <b>conduct</b> that creates obligations, quasi-contractual <b>unilateral</b> <b>conduct</b> that varies or discharges obligations and unilateral voluntary property transactions. Whereas quasi-contractual <b>unilateral</b> <b>conduct</b> is closely related to contracts and should thus generally be regulated {{in a manner similar to}} contracts, the unilateral voluntary property transaction is a distinct concept, to which specific rules apply.

40|$|The {{prohibition}} of {{certain types of}} anticompetitive <b>unilateral</b> <b>conduct</b> by firms possessing a substantial degree of market power is a cornerstone of competition law regimes worldwide. Yet notwithstanding the social costs of monopoly modern legal regimes refrain from prohibiting it outright. Instead, competition laws prohibit monopolies or dominant firms from engaging in those types of anticompetitive conduct that amount to monopolizing or an abuse of dominant position. Importantly, anticompetitive conduct can take place both {{on the road to}} monopoly and, later on, once substantial market power has been achieved. Legal regimes nevertheless tend either to ignore or pay only limited attention to the <b>unilateral</b> <b>conduct</b> of firms lacking substantial market power. This Article argues, however, that such conduct merits legal attention where it led or would lead if unstopped to the acquisition of substantial market power. Specifically, competition law regimes that fail to incorporate an appropriately-designed <b>unilateral</b> <b>conduct</b> liability in this area are unable to address some increasingly important classes of potentially harmful unilateral practices, such as those that concern cheap exclusion, multi-product (but not necessarily dominant) firms, network tipping effects, and more. This failure, moreover, may lead to distortions in other areas of <b>unilateral</b> <b>conduct</b> policy in these regimes that seek to compensate for the absence of any liability for the conduct of non-dominant firms. The analysis concludes by drawing together the lessons from the critical evaluation of the EU and the U. S. approaches for the appropriate design of <b>unilateral</b> <b>conduct</b> regimes worldwide...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{complete}} {{overview of the}} oligopoly problem in competition law and economics, with a specific focus on European Union (EU) law. A related purpose of the paper is to challenge the dominant view that merger control is the ultimate preventive remedy against tacit collusion. On close analysis, the merger-only enforcement paradigm against tacit collusion generates a systemic risk of type II errors. Part of this enforcement gap may, however, be alleviated through a more muscular enforcement of the rules on coordinated conduct (i. e. Article 101 TFEU) and on <b>unilateral</b> <b>conduct</b> (i. e. Article 102 TFEU). In this later respect, the paper formulates a possible theory of harm that would entitle agencies and courts to apply Article 102 TFEU to specific types of conduct by oligopolists. The concept of abuse of collective dominance may in particular {{be applied to the}} artificial tactics which oligopolists adopt to protect an observed collusive equilibrium from the natural, disruptive effect caused by an external shock (entry, natural disaster, change in tax rate, etc.).

Article 102 (a) of the EC Treaty forbids the imposition of unfair purchase or selling prices or other unfair trading conditions, but Commission's case law and policy statements (e. g. the 2008 Guidance Paper on Commission enforcement priorities in applying Article 82) have greatly emphasized exclusionary effects, with exploitative effects appearing to be little more than a sideshow. This practical emasculation of the relevant discipline makes little sense either in economic or legal terms, and leaves the overall conceptual picture in a state of complete disarray, with direct consequences on the legal enforcement...|$|E

Moreover, the conceptual distinction between considerations of ancillary restraints under Article 101 (1) TFEU and consideration of pro-competitive and anti-competitive effects under Article 101 (3) TFEU is slowly disappearing as well.

40|$|The {{prohibition}} against misuse of market power in section 46 (1) of the CCA (and its identical predecessor in the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth)) {{has been the}} subject of ongoing debate, and numerous legislative reviews, throughout its 40 -year history. A recurring issue considered by these reviews is whether the provision should be amended to incorporate an 'effects-based test', which would allow liability to be established on the basis of the effect of the impugned conduct on the competitive process in the relevant market. In 2015, the Harper Review became the first of these reviews to recommend the adoption of an 'effects-based test' and, in 2016, the government announced its intention to adopt this recommendation. The announcement remains controversial, praised by some as a long overdue 'strengthening' of the law, and criticised by others as protectionism for small businesses which would ultimately harm consumers. This dissertation addresses the question whether Australia should adopt an 'effects-based test' for misuse of market power. It does so in the context of the wider international debate about the appropriate standard for <b>unilateral</b> anticompetitive <b>conduct,</b> taking into account tests proposed for the characterisation of <b>unilateral</b> anticompetitive <b>conduct</b> in other jurisdictions, especially the United States and the European Union. It makes a comparative analysis of several 'profit-focused tests', including the existing Australian 'take advantage' test, and several 'effects-based tests', including the 'substantial lessening of competition' test proposed by the Harper Review. The respective proposals are evaluated in terms of their likely error costs, administrability and certainty. This dissertation argues that, despite the apparently intractable debate between advocates of profit-focused tests and advocates of effects-based tests, a common thread can be identified. Upon closer analysis, each of the proposals reveals a central concern, not with the actual effect of the conduct, nor with its profitability for the dominant firm, but with the objective purpose of the conduct. The dissertation concludes that a standard which expressly focuses on whether the impugned conduct had an 'objective anticompetitive purpose' is superior to both the profit-focused and effects-based approaches advocated to date...|$|R

40|$|If we {{can speak}} of the European Community’s ‘economic constitution’, we can assert that {{competition}} rules, together with free movement rules, form its core. Notably, implementation of the competition rules enshrined in Articles 81 and 82 EC changed radically with the enactment of Regulation 1 / 2003, which in effect dispensed with mandatory prior notifications and allowed national authorities to apply Article 101 (3) TFEU directly. Given that national legislations perceive certain types of <b>unilateral</b> <b>conduct,</b> even if adopted by a non-dominant undertaking, as a potential source of anticompetitive effects, an important question concerns the leeway enjoyed by national authorities under {{the exception to the}} convergence rule in Article 3 (2) of Regulation 1 / 2003, and the consequent effect on both legal practice and policy issues. In this lucidly argued book, focusing on national competition provisions in Germany, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom that deal with such conduct, the author provides a detailed examination of how such considerations as the following are affected by Regulation 1 / 2003 : [...] prohibition of abuse of economic dependence or superior bargaining power; [...] the particular susceptibility of long-term contracts; [...] prohibition of resale at a loss or below cost; [...] prohibition of boycott, unlawful pressures, threats, and other coercive tactics adopted by undertakings; and the role of unfair competition law. The analysis follows a functional method of comparative legal analysis, reviewing the most relevant norms in the selected jurisdictions, particularly in what concerns their goals and function {{in the context of their}} respective legal systems. Special attention is paid to two specific sectors – the motor-vehicle and the retailing industries – which have most often triggered relevant legislation and case law in the jurisdictions covered. Legal scholarship in the field is also drawn upon. In its clarification of the meaning of Regulation 1 / 2003, this book allows practitioners to fully grasp its scope. The author’s thorough, masterful analysis of the statutory framework of Article 3 of the regulation also reveals the variety of reasons why different Member States have different competition policies on the scope of the exception to the rule of convergence, and in this way provides lawyers, policymakers, and academics with welcome insights on how major EU jurisdictions apply European competition law. •	Preface. •	List of Abbreviations. •	CHAPTER 1 Introduction. •	CHAPTER 2 The Interplay between ECL and NCL before Regulation 1 / 2003. •	CHAPTER 3 Interplay between ECL and NCL after Regulation 1 / 2003. •	CHAPTER 4 <b>Unilateral</b> <b>Conduct</b> and Undertaking. •	CHAPTER 5 Economic and Legal Perspectives on Market Power. •	CHAPTER 6 National Provisions on the Abuse of Economic Dependence. •	CHAPTER 7 <b>Unilateral</b> <b>Conduct</b> of Non-dominant Firms. •	CHAPTER 8 Competition Issues and Unfair Trading Practices. •	CHAPTER 9 Economic Insights on Superior Bargaining Power. •	CHAPTER 10 Diversity and Competition Law. •	CHAPTER 11 <b>Unilateral</b> <b>Conduct</b> and Unfair Competition Law. •	CHAPTER 12 Unitas in Diversitate in Competition Law. •	Annex. •	Bibliography (Books, Chapters, Papers and Journals). •	Documents, Reports and Studies. •	Index.

Some of the these cases raised extremely complex legal and economic issues. The analysis of decision practice and case law highlights some critical aspects of recent antitrust enforcement, namely: (i) {{the need to}} strengthen the fight against cartels; (ii) the need to refine the tools used in merger analysis, also {{through the use of}} modern econometric methods; (iii) the need to enhance the role of economic analysis in the assessment of <b>unilateral</b> exclusionary <b>conduct,</b> in line with the Commission’s Guidance on Article 102 TFEU; and (iv) the need to find a better balance between competition rules and sector-specific regulation, so as to avoid overlapping and inconsistencies. A further critical issue is the need to reinforce the protection of the rights of defense. In order to improve the current administrative enforcement system, it is necessary to enhance the procedural guarantees and to remove the limits on judicial review of antitrust decisions, thus enabling administrative courts to review fully, in fact and in law, any aspect of the ICA’s finding of infringement, and to pronounce also on the merits of the case...|$|R

Nevertheless in fact in 2002 the new state declared maritime expansion to a distance of 100 nautical miles measured from the former Timor Gap lines.

After providing real-world examples of tying conspiracies, Professor Leslie explains how concerted tying arrangements present a far greater threat to competitive markets than traditional, unilaterally imposed tying arrangements. Because tying jurisprudence evolved without considering the existence or effects of concerted tie-ins, the current test for evaluating the legality of tying arrangements is inappropriately lenient to tying conspiracies. This is completely inconsistent with one fundamental principle of American antitrust law: concerted action should be treated more harshly than <b>unilateral</b> <b>conduct.</b> Finally, the Article advocates per se illegality for tying conspiracies and argues that greater appreciation of concerted tie-ins can inform the ongoing academic debate about tying arrangements more generally...|$|E

Because of COP Curry's remote location in Paktika, resupply was accomplished via the Air Force's Air Delivery Systems (ADS). Bravo regularly received food, water, fuel, and ammunition via air drop. During the deployment, they also received the largest air drop to date in operation Enduring Freedom, accepting a 4K all-terrain forklift.|$|R
40|$|This Article {{examines}} {{a category}} of conduct that I call “unfriendly unilateralism. ” One state deprives another of a benefit (unfriendly) and, in some cases, strays from its own obligations (noncompliant), outside any structured international process (<b>unilateral).</b> Such <b>conduct</b> troubles many international lawyers because {{it looks more like}} the nastiness of power politics than like the order and stability of law. Worse, states can abuse the conduct to undercut the law. Nevertheless, international law tolerates unfriendly unilateralism for enforcement. A victim state may use unfriendly unilateralism against a scofflaw in order to restore the legal arrangement that existed before the breach. Unfriendly unilateralism is tolerated here, despite its unsavory attributes, because the formal processes for enforcing international law are often deficient. Unfriendly unilateralism can compensate for that procedural deficiency and help make the law effective. This Article argues that unfriendly unilateralism can play a similarly vital role in lawmaking. The Article makes both a positive and a normative claim. The positive claim is that, in practice, states use unfriendly unilateralism not only to enforce but also to help generate law. Unfriendly unilateralism variously helps create new norms, prevent the erosion of existing norms, reconcile competing objectives, and strengthen or recalibrate regimes. Unfriendly unilateralism sometimes performs these functions even when the conduct itself is unlawful — that is, when the conduct is noncompliant and unexcused for enforcement. The Article’s normative claim is that such unchecked and even unlawful exercises of state power can be good for international law. Lawmaking allows the legal order to stay relevant and adapt to change. However, the formal processes for making international law, like those for enforcing it, can be deficient. Unfriendly unilateralism can compensate for that procedural deficiency and help instigate or support collective decisions...|$|R
40|$|Section 46 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('TPA') prohibits {{corporations}} with {{a substantial}} degree of market power from {{taking advantage of}} that power {{for the purpose of}} eliminating or substantially damaging a competitor, preventing the entry of a competitor into the market or deterring or preventing a competitor from engaging in competitive conduct. This thesis examines the role and efficacy of the 'purpose test' in s 46 of the TPA. Section 46 plays a unique and important part in competition law in Australia because it is the only provision that focuses on single-firm or <b>unilateral</b> anticompetitive <b>conduct.</b> The distinction between unilateral and concerted action has been recognised by the United States ('US') Supreme Court in antitrust jurisprudence. As will be demonstrated, this distinction between unilateral and concerted behaviour helps to explain the role of the 'purpose test' in s 46 and how it assists in identifying anticompetitive single-firm conduct. The 'purpose test' ensures that liability under s 46 will only attach to intentional conduct not inadvertent <b>conduct.</b> Judging <b>unilateral</b> behaviour in this manner reduces the risk that s 46 will deter pro-competitive conduct and harm competition. The High Court of Australia has given the 'purpose test' a multifaceted role in helping to distinguish between anticompetitive and pro-competitive behaviour. This is illustrated in the inter-relationship between purpose and the other core elements of s 46. The 'purpose test' has also been used as a forensic tool to aid in characterisation of the relevant conduct. The link between the 'purpose test' and legitimate business reasons for the impugned conduct is another way in which purpose helps to infer or refute liability under s 46. A legal comparison of the role of purpose in US monopolisation cases provides further validation of the fundamental role and efficacy of the 'purpose test' in identifying or distinguishing between illegitimate (anticompetitive) and legitimate (pro-competitive) conduct...|$|R
