50|$|Expanding <b>untied</b> <b>aid.</b>|$|E
50|$|One of {{the main}} {{arguments}} in favour of <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> is that tied aid can create important distortions in the market by {{limiting the number of}} countries where the recipient can make purchases. These limitations impede the recipient country’s ability to find the most cost-effective way to spend the aid they receive. It is estimated that goods and services purchased with tied aid cost 15-30% more than comparable goods and services acquired with <b>untied</b> <b>aid.</b> Furthermore, tied aid often favours capital-intensive goods and advising primarily in the donor country’s area of expertise. That may lead recipient countries to make purchases which are inappropriate for realising their development goals.|$|E
50|$|Japan's {{foreign aid}} program {{has been criticized for}} better serving the {{interests}} of Japanese corporations than those of developing countries. In the past, tied aid (grants or loans tied to the purchase of merchandise from Japan) was high, but <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> expanded rapidly in the 1980s, reaching 71% of all aid by 1986. This share compared favorably with other Development Assistance Committee countries and with the United States corresponding figure of 54%. Nevertheless, complaints continued that even Japan's <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> tended to be directed toward purchases from Japan. Aid in the form of grants (the share of aid disbursed as grants rather than as loans) was low relative to other Development Assistance Committee countries and remained so late in the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, {{the donor}} {{members of the}} Development Assistance Committee (DAC), a {{subcommittee}} of the OECD, agreed to virtually <b>untie</b> all <b>aid</b> to the Least Developed Countries. That Recommendation entered into effect on January 1, 2002. In addition, Australia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom have <b>untied</b> their <b>aid</b> beyond {{the requirements of the}} Recommendation.|$|R
40|$|This {{article has}} two main purposes. The {{first is that}} of {{providing}} a longitudinal analysis of the global politics of <b>untying</b> <b>aid,</b> by looking {{at a number of}} debates that have occurred within the Development Assistance Committee and {{in the context of a}} number of high-level forums on aid effectiveness. The second is that of proposing some explanations for the lack of significant progress in these contexts. The focus is on the European Union (EU), which has been widely perceived as one of the most fervent supporters of promoting the <b>aid</b> <b>untying</b> agenda. In all these debates, the EU's leadership aspirations have remained largely unfulfilled. Thus, the EU has failed to adopt a EU-wide vision on aid untying; persuade non-EU donors to <b>untie</b> their <b>aid,</b> even when it has played the reciprocity card; and promote a pro-poor use of foreign aid, by supporting local ownership and facilitating greater access of developing country firms to aid contracts...|$|R
5000|$|... "Untying aid: is it working?" [...] -- an {{independent}} evaluation of DAC members {{policies and practices}} towards untying -- finds that the overall picture is positive, with important qualifications. Country partners affirm that untying is about transferring responsibility from donors to recipients. Practically, {{it is a matter}} of contracts, modalities, use of country systems and offering local business an opportunity to compete for contracts. The report concludes that there is much scope for further actions towards <b>untying</b> <b>aid</b> in genuine partnerships between donors and aid recipients.|$|R
5000|$|Partially untied credits {{consist of}} a tied and an untied part. The latter is usually {{intended}} to finance [...] "local cost", investment cost {{to be made in}} the importing country. This part may also be in a local currency. Partially <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> is treated as tied aid.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, {{as part of}} an {{international}} initiative, AusAID <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> to Least Developed Countries. Since the White Paper in 2006, all AusAID procurement has been untied (i.e. open to international firms) except for the Australia Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development (AIPRD). There have not yet been significant numbers of contracts awarded to international firms.|$|E
50|$|Tied aid {{is foreign}} aid {{that must be}} spent in the country {{providing}} the aid (the donor country) or {{in a group of}} selected countries. A developed country will provide a bilateral loan or grant to a developing country, but mandate that the money be spent on goods or services produced in the selected country. From this it follows that <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> has no geographical limitations.|$|E
40|$|Aid volume from OECD {{countries}} {{has set a}} new record. However, the assistance recorded as ODA includes categories that do not contribute to reducing poverty in developing countries. Emerging economies and private donors provide an increasing proportion of aid. Progress {{has been made in}} implementing the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness in a few fields, such as <b>untying</b> <b>aid,</b> but the results do not meet expectations. The approach, too often purely technical, omits taking fully into consideration the political dimension which strongly affects aid effectiveness. The issue of overall policy coherence receives renewed attention {{at a time when the}} debate about climate change is leading development agencies to reconsider goals and strategies...|$|R

50|$|The tying of aid {{is a form}} of protectionism; {{however, the}} {{literature}} on this particular subject is rather scanty. One of the major problems in the <b>untying</b> of <b>aid</b> is the prisoner's dilemma. Those donors that want to abolish the practice will see their own interests damaged if the other donors do not follow.|$|R
5000|$|Officially {{supported}} {{export credit}} may {{be connected to}} official development assistance (ODA) in two ways. First, they may be mixed with ODA, while still financing the same project (mixed credit). As the export credit is tied to purchases in the issuing country, the whole package qualifies as a tied aid credit, even if the ODA part is <b>untied</b> <b>aid.</b> Second, tied aid credits are not very different from export credits, except in interest, grace period (the time {{when there is no}} repayment of the principal) and terms of repayment. Such credits are separated from export credit by an OECD requirement that they have a minimum degree of [...] "softness". [...] "Softness" [...] is measured by a formula that compares the present value of the credit with the present value of the same amount at standardized [...] "commercial" [...] terms. This difference is expressed {{as a percentage of the}} credit and called [...] "concessionality level". Thus a grant has a concessionality level of 100%, a commercial credit scores zero per cent. The higher the concessionality level, the more the tied aid credit looks like ODA, the lower, the more it looks like an export credit.|$|E
40|$|The {{debate on}} aid {{effectiveness}} {{has been going}} on for some time especially in an environment of budgetary pressure on the various economies of CAD (Comité d’Aide au Développement) countries. This article questions the place of <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> in development aid policies towards the African continent and gains in efficiency. If it is clear that the disbursement of Official Development Assistance has not reached its targets, it has adapted and evolved. The article analyzes the different implications of <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> in terms of development and questions whether its emergence within the debate on the effectiveness would not be a smokescreen. For <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> to be effective, some inherent contradictions have to be addressed. Untying aid in practice is subject to other constraints in recipient countries, and even <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> finds itself in some way tied de facto...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluate}} the differential effects of Tied and <b>Untied</b> <b>aid</b> on growth, {{and how these}} effects vary with the policy environment of the recipient country. To do so, we use Burnside and Dollar (2000) and Easterly, Levine and Roodman (2003) datasets. We find that aid effectiveness is not significantly different for {{the two types of}} aid. However, when we condition on policies, we find that <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> has a greater impact on growth than tied aid. We find that this difference is significant for the sample of low and middle-income countries, and is not statistically significant, but consistent in sign for the sub sample of low-income countries.

50|$|Further {{progress}} {{on this particular}} issue is being implemented {{as part of the}} Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. However, of the 12 indicators included, the <b>untying</b> of bilateral <b>aid</b> is the only item without a deadline for its competition.|$|R
50|$|At the DAC High Level Meeting in May 2000, members {{agreed to}} <b>untie</b> their <b>aid</b> (with the {{exception}} of technical cooperation and food aid) from January 2001 onwards to the Least Developed Countries and to promote buying goods and services locally in these countries, rather than in donor countries. This agreement was extended in 2008 to 39 highly indebted poor countries (HIPCs). As a consequence, in 2008 80% of total ODA (minus administrative costs) was provided untied, 4% tied and of 16% the tying status was not reported.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the impact of}} foreign aid on the growth and macroeconomic performance of a small recipient economy. Both tied and <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> are considered, as well as permanent and temporary programs. The long-run impact of tied aid and its transitional dynamics depend crucially upon the elasticity of substitution in production, being more effective when this is low. Co-financing arrangements are also emphasized. This contrasts sharply {{with the effects of}} <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> which, with fixed labor supply, has no growth or dynamic consequences but is always welfare improving. These differences also apply to temporary aid flows. Whereas a temporary <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> shock has only a modest short-run growth effect, its tied counterpart has significant impacts on short-run growth and dynamics. Finally, temporary foreign aid programs, irrespective of their nature, have permanent effects on the levels of key economic variables...|$|E
40|$|Three {{questions}} regarding the relationship between untied assistance and donor country exports are investigated. First, do <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> flows cause donor country exports to increase, reflecting the goodwill of the recipient towards the donor? Second, does strong export performance financially enable or politically encourage the donor country to increase its level of <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> to the recipient? Third, does causality proceed in both directions simultaneously? Using German data for the period 1973 - 1995, results vary across subsamples defined according to the recipient countries' region, income and ties to Germany. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of foreign aid in a small {{recipient}} country with two traded goods, one non-traded good, and two factors. Learning by doing and intersectoral knowledge spillovers contribute to endogenous growth. We obtain two main results. First, a permanent increase in <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> raises (or lowers) the growth rate if and only if the non-traded good is more capital intensive (or effective labour intensive) than the operating traded good. Second, a permanent increase in <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> raises welfare if the non-traded good is more capital intensive than the operating traded good; otherwise, it may raise or lower welfare. ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{addresses}} the obstacles hampering African universities from play-ing their needed role in national development, particularly challenges stem-ming from the unfinished agenda of national reforms and emergence of global-ization. It examines pervading issues {{of higher education}} {{within the context of}} HIV/AIDS pandemic and massive brain drain—two major issues currently confronting Africa. Using OECD countries for comparison, it presents demo-graphic, migration, health, and educational analysis for Africa. The paper un-derscores the presence of substantial differences between countries with re-spect to incomes, education systems, political institutions, and, in a more dy-namic sense, economic performance over time. It also argues that we are un-dergoing an integration process (through globalization) which is critically based on knowledge. It warns that developing countries are falling behind industrial-ized ones in terms of low enrollments, low quality of education output, and low retention of qualified persons. The article recommends as more sensible policy options (a) developing standards for “borderless ” international educa-tion and resource sharing, (b) mitigating brain drain, and (c) <b>untying</b> <b>aid</b> in favor of focusing on the development, retention, promotion, and use of local talent.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} comprises two essays {{that attempt}} to determine, empirically, the fiscal response of governments’ to international assistance. The first essay examines whether an increasingly popular recommendation in international aid policy to switch from tied foreign assistance to untied foreign assistance affects investment in critical development expenditure sectors by developing countries. In the past, most international aid {{has been in the}} form of tied assistance as donors believed that tying aid will improve its effectiveness. It has been argued, that if tied aid is well designed and effectively managed then its overall effectiveness can be improved. On the contrary, it is also believed that tied aid acts as an impediment to donor cooperation and the building of partnership with developing countries. In addition, it is also argued that it removes the ‘feeling’ of ownership and responsibility of projects from partner countries in aid supported development. Two other more popular arguments used to challenge the effectiveness of foreign aid is that it is compromised when tied to the goods and services of the donor countries because almost 30 percent of its value is eliminated and also because it does not allow recipient countries to act on their priorities for public spending. These problems bring into question whether tied aid is truly {{the most effective way to}} help poor countries. A recommendation by the international community is that a switch to <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> would be necessary. With <b>untied</b> <b>aid,</b> the recipient country is not obligated to buy the goods of the donor country neither is it compelled to pursue the public expenditure priorities of donors. Instead with <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> they will have greater flexibility over spending decisions and can more easily pursue the priorities of their countries as they see fit. Hence, one could expect that a one dollar increase in <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> will increase spending in the critical priority sectors by more than a one dollar increase in tied assistance. The question therefore is whether national domestic priorities coincide or not with what the international community has traditionally deemed should be priority. Empirically, we test this prediction using country-by-country data for 57 countries for the period 1973 to 2006. The results suggest that on average <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> has a greater impact on pro-poor spending than do tied aid. In addition, the results also suggest that fungibility is still an issue even after accounting for the effects of <b>untied</b> <b>aid.</b> However, one could argue that fungibility may not be as bad as it appears since the switch to <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> improves spending in the sectors that are essential for growth and development. The second essay explores the hypothesis that the expectations of debt forgiveness can discourage developing countries from attaining fiscal independence through an improvement of their tax effort. On the one hand, the international financial community typically advises poor countries to improve revenue mobilization but, on the other hand, the same international community routinely continues to bail-out poor countries that fail to meet their loan repayment obligations. The act of bailing-out these countries creates an expectation on the part of developing country governments that they will receive debt forgiveness time and again in the future. Therefore, the expectation of future bail outs creates a moral hazard that leads to endemic lower tax efforts. The key prediction of our simple theoretical model is that in the presence of debt forgiveness, tax ratios will decline and this decline will be stronger the higher the frequency and intensity of the bailouts. Empirically, we test this prediction using country-level data for 66 countries for the period 1989 to 2006. The results strongly suggest that debt forgiveness plays a significant role in the low tax effort observed in developing countries. Our empirical model allows for the endogeneity of tax effort and debt forgiveness. Interestingly we find that more debt forgiveness is actually provided to countries with lower tax effort. The results are robust to various specifications...|$|E

The share of foreign aid to Sub-Saharan Africa has fallen during the 1990 s and aid flows to low-income countries have also declined, {{partly as a result of}} the diversion of aid flows to transition economies and ¡®trouble spots¡¯. The paper also finds that donor aid programs are thinly spread over many recipients. However, reductions in aid amounts have been accompanied by improvements in the quality of aid.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a {{theoretical and empirical}} analysis of a donor’s choice of the composition of unrestricted and in-kind/restricted transfers to a recipient and how this composition is adjusted in response {{to changes in the}} moral hazard behavior of the recipient. In-kind or restricted transfers may be used, among others, to control a recipient’s moral hazard behavior but may be associated with deadweight losses. Within the context of foreign aid, we use a canonical political agency model to construct a simple signaling game between a possibly corrupt politician in a recipient country and a donor to illustrate the donor’s optimal choice of tied (restricted) and <b>untied</b> foreign <b>aid.</b> We clarify the condition under which a reduction in the recipient’s moral hazard behavior (i. e., improvement in the level of governance) leads to a fall in the proportion of tied aid.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to analyze governance systems in Southeast Asia and proposes some policy suggestions that can improve governance {{practices in the}} region. It also discusses the links between governance and official development assistance {{and the role of}} the Japan Bank for International Cooperation. To put the discussion on governance systems in a proper context, the paper discusses the governance and growth nexus in Southeast Asia; describes the operating governance systems in Southeast Asia; analyzes economic governance, more specifically in the areas of economic management and growth, revenue generation, social spending, access to services, cost of doing business, and corporate governance; and examines political governance, focusing on the rule of law and judicial independence, conflict management, and voice participation. Regardless of level of development, Southeast Asian countries need to establish and strengthen their transparency and accountability structures, both in the public and private sectors, in order to continue the momentum for broad-based growth. It is also necessary to strengthen the fiscal autonomy of their sub-national units, and provide more room for participation by civil society groups. More responsive and simplified regulatory structures are needed, and so are strong law enforcement mechanisms. The rise of ethnic tensions argues for better peace-building institutions to narrow the gap between groups. In all these, the ultimate challenge lies in seeking allies and building constituencies for reform. To make ODA better managed and more effective, donors must work in partnership (that is, have a common basket) rather than in competition. Donors can also enhance the value of aid by increasingly providing ideas and not just goods, <b>untying</b> <b>aid</b> and allowing recipient countries to take “ownership” and greater flexibility in the use of aid. For Japanese development assistance, in particular, Japanese aid agencies must adopt a strategic approach to assisting poverty reduction in the poorer countries of Southeast Asia, while extending their concessional window to middle-income countries. Japan can do well in providing “ideas aid” based on the Japanese experience. Japanese ODA can have higher leverage if an increasing part of the aid is used for institution building and reforms in governance. governance, development program, corruption...|$|R
