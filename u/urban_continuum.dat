40|$|Urban {{ecosystems}} are constantly evolving, {{and they are}} expected to change in both space and time with active management or degradation. An <b>urban</b> watershed <b>continuum</b> (UWC) framework recognizes a continuum of engineered and natural hydrologic flowpaths that expand hydrologic networks in new ways that help us to use hydrologic connectivity to study and characterize downstream fluxes and transformations of carbon, contaminants, energy, and nutrients across four space and time dimensions. Given current tendencies to transition from sanitary to sustainable cities, an UWC helps researchers and managers to acknowledge the evolving relationship between civil infrastructure and ecosystem function. Leaf litter inputs {{are an integral part of}} the trophic structure of many stream ecosystems and litter breakdown is a key ecosystem function in forest and stream ecosystems. Urban litter inputs are driven by civil drainage infrastructure rather than riparian sources. Litter breakdown processes determine how much of these inputs are available, and in what form, for habitat and food resources both for local and downstream ecosystems. These were measured in-situ for American Sycamore and London Planetree leaves in a forest and a suburban stream. Leaf breakdown rates were faster in the more urbanized catchment stream, and for some of the more urbanized landscape sources. The dense drainage networks of urban catchments facilitate organic matter transport, creating a gutter subsidy to streams that likely dwarf natural riparian input. Storm and dry weather DOC, and FPOM samples from streams of the BES LTER urban stream network revealed temporally dynamic systems greatly influenced by impervious cover, with high OM fluxes and concentrations. DOC and FPOM patterns and elevated post storm flow concentrations and fluxes suggest that the engineered subsurface drainage networks facilitate transport with both surface and groundwater playing key roles. These create an <b>urban</b> stream <b>continuum</b> whereby upstream zero order stream functions are shifted up-gradient, into the landscape, making urban drainage an important part of an integrated ecohydrologic system...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Concepts and {{theories}} employed in today's African urban studies {{have often been}} transfers from Western urbanisation Studies which have embodied transfers of cultural values. These have generally been applied without paying enough attention either to indigenous sociocultural and value systems, nor to analysing and interpreting the relevance of Africa's point in an <b>urban</b> evolutionary <b>continuum.</b> The uncritical transfer and application of such concepts has led to prescriptions and recommendations for urban management policies and programmes that have proved largely ineffective, and involved much misdirection and misapplication of limited resources. The consequence has been the continued exacerbation and compounding of urban problems. It is argued that effective policy responses can only be derived from a more realistic evaluation of African urban problems, based not only on Western European analytical perspectives, {{but also on the}} analysis of economic, historical sociocultural factors indigenous to Africa itself...|$|R

40|$|Sierra Leone has {{recently}} {{emerged from a}} long period of political instability and is ranked among the world's poorest countries. During the decade-long civil war of the 1990 s, widespread forced out-migration left much of the countryside abandoned, as rural residents fled to the safety of the capital city, Freetown. Consequently, food production became severely dislocated and, in the post-conflict era, the state of the agricultural sector has become a major concern to governmental and non-governmental development agencies. Focussing on the question of urban food security in Freetown, this paper examines the incidence, dynamics and significance of urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) among households, at a crucial point in Sierra Leone's post-conflict reconstruction phase. Drawing on recent field-based data, the paper contributes to the growing debate concerning how urban planning and development might be reconciled with the promotion of an ‘enabling environment’ in which UPA is encouraged and supported. It is argued {{that in the case of}} Freetown, a detailed evaluation of UPA is urgently needed to determine how agricultural activities can fit in with urban structure, urban problems and the livelihoods of a wide range of actors in and around the city. The paper concludes that not only is UPA a vital element in ensuring household food security, but it could potentially play a fundamental role in safeguarding the <b>urban</b> food <b>continuum</b> and promoting sustainable urbanization in the post-conflict period and beyond...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{attempted}} to further knowledge of urban development by examining two related themes: firstly, it considered the socio-spatial structures {{of a series}} of small English towns during the mid- 19 th century, a period of industrialization and urbanization, paying particular reference to the relationship between their development and the <b>urban</b> spatial <b>continuum</b> model known to operate in large cities undergoing industrialization; secondly, it examined the effect of economic function on urban structure and development at this small town scale and, to this end, the four study towns were {{selected on the basis of}} their functional dissimilarities. The analytical processes used ranged from simple manipulation of information from sources of limited utility to three series of multivariate analyses of Census Enumberators’ Book data - cross-sections of the towns based on information from the 1851 and 1871 censuses and longitudinal analyses of relative change between these two censuses. The results indicated that the towns did conform to the continuum model, at least in morphological terms, since, in 1851, their residential patterns could be associated with its 'pre-industrial' stage but, by 1871, three of the towns were progressing towards its second or 'industrial' phase. The factor analyses also identified considerable social change and this theme was continued in examinations of the towns' migration patterns and their social interaction and mobility rates (using marriage licence data for these last two investigations). In each town, differences were found between the mobility patterns of various social groups within their populations but these did not mask the differences between the populations as a whole. However, contrary to expectations, it was not the industrial towns' populations that had the highest overall mobility rates, but those of the more prosperous market towns. This result demonstrated that while social change might have been associated with industrialization at a national level, this was not necessarily the case in small towns where local factors were of more importance...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 31 st Annual Southern African Transport Conference 9 - 12 July 2012 "Getting Southern Africa to Work", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. Railways are inherently competitive when they exploit their strengths of heavy axle load, high speed, and many coupled vehicles. However, urban guided transit, whether steel- or rubber tyred, naturally achieves neither heavy axle load nor high speed: Many coupled vehicles are its only comparative advantage. Four lighter guided transit modes have therefore made inroads into rail’s traditional domain. The authors hypothesized that country and city attributes influenced which guided transit mode or modes fitted particular cities. They populated a database with ninety-eight variables from three hundred and thirty cities, and applied the statistical interventions multivariate factor analysis and structural equation modeling to it. Findings included seven country latent variables whose regression coefficients pointed to the positioning of Heavy Metro, Automated Guided Transit, Monorail, Light Metro, Bus Rapid Transit, and Light Rail: Heavy Metro and Light Rail now represent the poles of an <b>urban</b> guided transit <b>continuum,</b> in which rubber-tyred automated modes have penetrated rail’s traditional market space. In conclusion, green cities require more nuanced guided transit solutions that also address lower capacity requirements. In South Africa, alternative contemporary guided transit solutions {{to the challenges of}} long commutes to and from low density communities should be considered.

40|$|Abstract Background An {{important}} but understudied component of Canada's health system is alternative care. The {{objective of this}} paper is to examine the geographic and socio-demographic characteristics of alternative care consultation in Ontario, Canada's largest province. Methods Data is drawn from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS Cycle 3. 1, 2005) for people aged 18 or over (n = 32, 598) who had a consultation with an alternative health care provider. Four groups of consultations are examined: (1) all consultations (2) massage therapy (3) acupuncture, and (4) homeopath/naturopath. Descriptive statistics, mapping and logistic regression modeling are employed to analyze the data and to compare modalities of alternative health care use. Results In 2005, more than 1. 2 million adults aged 18 or over consulted an alternative health care provider, representing about 13 % of the total population of Ontario. The analysis revealed a varied geographic pattern of consultations across the province. Consultations were fairly even across the <b>urban</b> to rural <b>continuum</b> and rural residents were just as likely to consult a provider as their urban counterparts. From a health perspective, people with a chronic condition, lower health status and self-perceived unmet health care needs were more likely to see an alternative health provider. Women with chronic conditions such as fibromyalgia, high blood pressure, chronic fatigue syndrome and chemical sensitivities were more likely to see an alternative provider if they felt their health care needs were not being met. Conclusions The analysis revealed that geography is not a factor in determining alternative health care consultations in Ontario. By contrast, there is a strong association between these consultations and socio-demographic characteristics particularly age, sex, education, health and self-perceived unmet health care needs. The results underscore the importance of women's health needs as related to alternative care use. The paper concludes that there is a need for more place-specific research that explores the reasons why people use specific types of alternative health care as tied to socio-economic status, health, place of residence, and knowledge of these treatments. </p...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{disparities in}} {{academic}} and behavioral functioning are well {{documented in the}} U. S. Compared to more advantaged peers, low-income children begin kindergarten with fewer of the competencies that undergird school success. These disparities persist or grow as children age and ultimately relate to low educational attainment, worse psychological functioning, and intergenerational transmission of poverty in adulthood. In addressing income gaps in development, we must consider the changing geography of poverty. The last several decades have seen increases {{in the number of}} low-income families residing in suburbs and small towns, while poverty rates in urban centers and rural communities have remained high. Currently, low- income children are dispersed across communities spanning the urban-rural <b>continuum.</b> <b>Urban,</b> suburban, and rural areas represent unique contexts for development, which may alter relations between income and academic and behavioral functioning. In a series of studies using nationally representative data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998 - 1999 (N≈ 16, 000) and data from the Early Steps Multisite Study of 731 low-income families with children, this dissertation explores (1) whether links between family income and achievement and behavior problems at kindergarten entry differ by urbanicity; (2) whether links between income and growth/decline in achievement and behavior problems across elementary school differ by urbanicity; and (3) the processes that explain why economic disadvantage is differentially related to development across urbanicity. Results show that income gaps in kindergarten achievement are attenuated in rural areas and exacerbated in urban cities. Conversely, economic disparities in externalizing problems at kindergarten are largest in rural areas and small cities and relatively small in large urban cities and suburbs. Looking from kindergarten through fifth grade, income is more strongly linked to achievement growth and is more predictive of decreased risk of elevated behavior problems in rural areas and small cities compared to large cities and suburbs. Finally, within a sample of disadvantaged 5 -year-olds, findings suggest that low-income rural children have better academic skills and fewer behavior problems than peers in urban areas, and this is partially explained by comparatively lower levels of pollution and neighborhood danger experienced by low-income rural children and families...|$|R
40|$|The {{planning}} and management of change has tended to be directed towards the achievement of end states. Adaptive procedures are generally undertaken when it is felt that these end states will not be reached and intervention is necessary. This intervention is usually determined by the technical and organizational criteria of the management system. This thesis argues, using the land-use planning system as a central example, that such an approach to change management fails to acknowledge {{the diversity of the}} process. Two points are considered to be fundamental to this argument. Firstly, that diversity is the generator of change, and not merely an inconvenient constraint upon its management Secondly, change follows multi-dimensional pathways (through time, across space, and between themes), that do not conform to technical, linear. management criteria. Failure to recognise these points inevitably hinders the ability of management systems to adapt to the uncertainty of the environment for which they have assumed responsibility. One measure of this failure is the mis-match between the agenda set by the managers of change, and that which is desired by the consumers of the process. The thesis supports the need for integrated management systems that are cognizant of, and driven by, the variety which is identified within the consumer agenda. The field work for the study considers ways of identifying {{the nature and extent of}} this variety. It will be argued that individuals interpret, negotiate, and effect change interactively with the wider social system. This interaction combines with the social and physical environments encountered by individuals in their daily lives, to define a 'sense of place'. A multi-method approach is developed which uses the demographic attributes of the. study village as bench marks that will allow comparison with other localities, and place it on an <b>urban</b> - rural <b>continuum.</b> This quantitative data also provides a means by which the variety of qualitative data can be assessed, and upon which provisional classifications about how particular groupings respond to change can be based. An interview and questionnaire instrument will be introduced. This will enable respondents to construct their own cognitive pathways of how changes which are pertinent to the local environment have evolve~. These pathways are then compared with the criteria Identified In land-use planning documentation, and the level of congruence between the two examined...|$|R

This paper uses Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) geo-referenced data {{to look beyond the}} simple urban/rural division by spatially locating survey clusters along an <b>urban</b> <b>continuum</b> and producing estimates of fertility and child mortality by four city size categories in West Africa. Results show a gradient in urban characteristics and demographic outcomes: the largest cities are the most advantaged and smaller cities least advantaged with respect to access to urban amenities, lower fertility and under- 5 survival rates. There is a difference in the patterns of fertility and under- 5 survival across urban categories, with fertility more linearly associated with city size while the only significant distinction for under- 5 survival in urban areas is broadly between the larger and smaller cities. Notably, the small urban ‘satellite cities’ that are adjacent to the largest cities have the most favourable outcomes of all categories. Although smaller urban areas have significantly lower fertility and child mortality than rural areas, in some cases this difference is nearly as large between the smallest and largest urban areas. These results are used to argue for the need to give greater consideration to employing an <b>urban</b> <b>continuum</b> in demographic researc...|$|E

The process of urbanization of the Spanish coast in the last 40 years was fervent. In 2000, 34, 2 % of the first kilometre of the peninsular Mediterranean coastal fringe was completely urbanized. The littoral fringe of the Mediterranean regions presents an <b>urban</b> <b>continuum</b> from Gerona (in the North) to the Strait of Gibraltar (in the South) largely connected with the development of tourism. In some provinces as Málaga, Barcelona and Alicante, this percentage represents or exceeds 50 % of the littoral. In this context, it is to Murcie that the process is by comparison the most important. The urbanistic development of the region of Murcie is facilitated by an accommodating urbanistic legislation. In 2004, the Regional Government approved managers of development of the coast who declare urbanisables 85 000 hectares in the municipalities of the coast. But the real impulse in the urbanisation process comes from Actuaciones de Interés Regional (AIR) such as Marina de Cope. This project claims to be the biggest urbano-tourist complex of Europe.

40|$|Three models predict an {{association}} between urbanism and nontraditional behavior: (1) {{that it is a}} function of the characteristics of individuals found in cities; (2) that it is due to the anomie of cities; (3) that it is due to the generation of and consequent influence of innovative urban subcultures. Sec-ondary analysis of American survey data on religiosity, church attendance, attitudes toward alcohol and birth control confirm the general urbanism-deviance association. Controlling for covariates suggests that Model 1 is inadequate for there remains an independent effect of residence-albeit a quite small one-unaccounted for by individual traits. Some suggestive data point to Model 3 as the more accurate one. The common observation that cities harbor unconventional behavior has been fundamental to theories relating urbanism to the individual. As many reviewers have noted, the Chicago School's understanding of urban life was largely founded on interpreting these nontraditional behaviors as evidence of the social disorganiza-tion intrinsic to cities. It is the purpose of this paper to investigate, first, whether that com-mon observation is empirically so, and most importantly, why it is so. Understanding the mechanism is crucial to understanding urban-ism itself. This paper will therefore address the ques-tion: What is the effect of urban residence on the individual's adherence to traditional values?

40|$|Municipal annexations play an {{important}} role in converting undeveloped land to development, influencing landscape change. However, the existing literature does not explore the links between annexation and development. An additional inadequacy is the failure to consider environment/landscape aspect of annexation. Therefore, this dissertation proposes a new theoretical framework that is drawn upon political ecology and structuration theory to examine annexation phenomenon processes: environmental/landscape sensitivity and its causal social structures. Frederick and Caroline counties in Maryland from 1990 to 2010 were the two case-study areas because both counties experience increased annexation activities and are representative of suburban and exurban settings at rural - <b>urban</b> <b>continuum</b> of the United States. The data used in this qualitative research were collected from multiple data sources, including key-person interviews, a review of Maryland's annexation log, annexation applications and meeting minutes, and observations at public meetings. Triangulating content analysis, discourse analysis, and social network analysis, this research finds that environmental/landscape is not considered more widely in annexation practices. Although environmental mitigation measures are considered at site level if a property has site environmental elements, the overall environmental/landscape sensitivity is low. It is also found that the economic-centered space remains dynamic in the annexation processes determining annexation approvals and low-density zoning. In addition, the triangulated analyses reveal that current social structures are not conducive to environmental-conscious landscape planning because environmentally oriented non-profit organizations and residents are injected at a later stage of annexation process and is not being fully considered in the evaluation process. Power asymmetry in current annexation structures is due to a lack of environmental voice in annexation processes. The voice of such groups needs to be institutionalized to facilitate more tenable annexation practices...|$|E

Methods: Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios were analyzed from the fingernails of 431 volunteer subjects living in different settings ranging from rural villages, small towns to urban centers along the Solimoes River. Data from 200 dietary intake surveys were also collected using food frequency questionnaires and 24 -h recall interviews {{in an effort to}} determine qualitative aspects of diet composition. Results: Fingernail delta(13) C values (mean standard deviation) were - 23. 2 +/- 1. 3, 20. 2 +/- 1. 5, and 17. 4 +/- 1. 3 parts per thousand and delta(15) N values were 11. 8 +/- 0. 6, 10. 4 +/- 0. 8, and 10. 8 +/- 0. 7 parts per thousand for those living in rural villages, small towns, and major cities, respectively. We found a gradual {{increase in the number of}} food items derived from C(4) plant types (meat and sugar) and the replacement of food items derived from C(3) plant types (fish and manioc flour) with increasing size of urban centers. Conclusion: Increasing urbanization in the Brazilian Amazon is associated with a significant change in food habits with processed and industrialized products playing an increasingly important role in the diet and contributing to the nutrition transition in the region.

40|$|The city {{is looking}} for ways to {{increase}} the flow of money into its economy. It believes that it has a potential for increasing tourism. How does it evaluate its potential and what does it need to do to build its tourism potential? The Value of Tourism Tourism is {{one of the fastest growing}} industries in the world. Tourism-based development approaches can be found in communities of all sizes on the rural to <b>urban</b> <b>continuum.</b> Why would a community want to pursue a tourism-based development approach? There are several compelling reasons: (1) tourism can provide both direct and indirect economic benefits; (2) tourism can generate various social and cultural benefits; and (3) tourism can help achieve environmental objectives. Further, tourism-based development can often be applied in communities that may not have many other choices for encouraging economic development and this makes it a useful tool to address. The ability of tourism-based development to be applied to a variety of communities facing many different issues and challenges is appealing, and thus holds much potential. What is the “tourism industry? ” According to one definition, it is the action and activities of people taking trips to a place or places outside their home community for any purpose except daily commuting to and from work; it includes business travel as well as travel for pleasure (Nickerson, 1996). It is comprised of many different organizations from both the public and private sectors including: · Attractions – recreational, cultural, historic, scenic · Food services – restaurants and other food providers · Accommodations – hotels, motels, inns, campgrounds, private homes · Travel distributors – travel agents, tour operators, wholesalers and ticket agencies · Supporting infrastructure – necessary infrastructure to support tourism activities including utilities and other service...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of a theoretical occupation with the »city« there is a large uncertainty in defining what urban form is and what it eventually consists of. As a matter of fact, we somewhat instinctively attribute morphologically completely diverse urban entities with this term, notwithstanding their often utterly unlike topographic settings or cultural backgrounds. Moreover, we do so not only with properly existing entities, but expand our »idea of the city« also over the past. And yet, until today we do not find considerable comprehensive definitions for the »city«, which cover all its aspects. Moreover, the growing uncertainty of how to plan and design cities today eventually aggravates the assignment. Yet, despite the definitory quandary, our »idea of the city« is seemingly settled on a commonsensical formal conception than on scientifically verifiable functional features: We recognize cities by taking a look at their layout from an airplane window or by approaching a city's skyline in a vehicle. We perceive urban space by strolling through its streets and places, or even by visiting deserted archaeological sites of long gone civilizations. For this perception, arguably, the sheer formal appearance is sufficient, to which we then of course add functional relations according to our contemporary understanding of urban life. Ultimately, one might speak of a »formal urban continuum« that for us exists since the Bronze Age and carries on until today and which without further thought is inscribed in our common knowledge as reference for any urban entity we encounter. The aim of the proposed presentation is to suggest an approach towards this formal <b>urban</b> <b>continuum,</b> by examining its phenomenological condition and by investigating for its possible parameters, whose systemic interrelation might, in spite of the common formal idea, eventually explain the grand diversity of cities...|$|E
40|$|Romania has {{the highest}} share of European Union rural areas (44. 9 % in 2009), which generates and {{maintains}} {{a long series of}} regional disparities. Because of these disparities, the economy faces a number of elements that undermine the quality of human and social capital and reduces the potential for growth: precarious social and economic infrastructure, reduced access to markets and thus to goods, a low level of both economic cohesion and living standards, and a difficult access to education and training (leading to the underutilization of labor in rural areas, while major shortages in the labor market and increased migration phenomenon manifests). In these circumstances the European Union LEADER initiative is an important chance for the development and tightening of the rural- <b>urban</b> <b>continuum</b> in Romania. A fundamental element of this initiative are the local action groups. These local action groups are conceived rather as an ad hoc framework for exchanging ideas, for debate on matters of local interest, on initiatives to boost economic activities. Thus, these local partnership structures can be self-organized by very real problems and directions: to promote a brand of product made in a certain area, the image of a tourist attraction, of traditional occupations, crafts of products, etc. In this paper, the authors aim to highlight the difficulties of European integration for rural areas in the new Member States, considering that the LEADER initiative would be a good opportunity to accelerate this process. To emphasize this, a review of the progress in implementing the LAGs program in Central and Eastern Europe was undertake. Also, we identified the success factors of this program based on the experience of the European Union developed countries. Finally, we provide arguments in favor of local action groups as the solution to the rural problem of Romania...|$|E
