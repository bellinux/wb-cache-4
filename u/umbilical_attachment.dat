40|$|Summary. Eight {{animals with}} {{abdominal}} fetuses {{were found in}} a relatively small colony of Djungarian hamsters. All the fetuses were macerated. Some had remains of an amniotic sac with an <b>umbilical</b> <b>attachment</b> to a placenta adherent to the peritoneum, but others were without placental remains. Gross and histological examinations failed to reveal any ruptures of the uterus or oviducts. It {{was not possible to}} decide whether the abdominal pregnancies were primary or secondary...|$|E
40|$|Presently in India {{if we ever}} {{recollect}} {{having taken}} an oath, our taken oaths that have been individualized and customized to what the individual medical schools feel should be administered. Even these, however, {{in one way or}} the other have some <b>umbilical</b> <b>attachment</b> to the original hippocratic oath. Now, we shall dissect and discuss the original hippocratic oath, line by line and para by para in context to the present medical scenario. It starts: “I swear by Apollo the physician, and Aesculapius, and Health, and All-heal, and all the gods and goddesses, that, according to my ability and judgment, I will keep this Oath and this stipulation”. The above lines mention Greek Gods as these lines were written by a Greek physician; however, as this oath is being administered globally, it would be more acceptable now to swear by a universal “God”...|$|E
40|$|Placenta {{begins to}} meet the demands of embryo as early as from 3 rd week of Intra Uterine life even before the mother is aware of her pregnancy. Pregnancy Induced Hypertension affects the Pathophysiology of Placenta. It is one of the deadliest {{complications}} affecting the fetal and maternal health. With this view a comparative Morphological study was carried out on 100 placentae. 50 placentae of PIH group and 50 placentae of normal group (control group) were collected and examined grossly for number of cotyledons, <b>umbilical</b> cord <b>attachment,</b> presence of infarction, calcification, fibrosis or any other gross anomaly. It was found that presence of Infarction is significant in cases of PIH group. Presence of calcification and decreased number of cotyledons were also found in PIH group though not statistically significant. There was no association of a particular pattern of <b>umbilical</b> cord <b>attachment</b> to placenta in PIH group...|$|R
