5|$|The {{accuracy}} of the measured value of the Avogadro constant is currently limited by the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> value of the Planck constant—a measure relating the energy of photons to their frequency. That relative standard uncertainty has been 50parts per billion (ppb) since 2006. By fixing the Avogadro constant, the practical effect of this proposal {{would be that the}} <b>uncertainty</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mass of a 12C atom—and the magnitude of the kilogram—could be no better than the current 50ppb <b>uncertainty</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Planck constant. Under this proposal, the magnitude of the kilogram would be subject to future refinement as improved measurements {{of the value of the}} Planck constant become available; electronic realizations of the kilogram would be recalibrated as required. Conversely, an electronic definition of the kilogram (see Electronic approaches, below), which would precisely fix the Planck constant, would continue to allow 83⅓ moles of 12C to have a mass of precisely one kilogram but the number of atoms comprising a mole (the Avogadro constant) would continue to be subject to future refinement.|$|E

40|$|The {{sources of}} {{theoretical}} <b>uncertainties</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> prediction of the two-neutron drip line are analyzed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> framework of covariant density functional theory. We concentrate on single-particle and pairing properties as {{potential sources of}} these uncertainties. The major source of these uncertainties {{can be traced back}} to <b>the</b> differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> underlying single-particle structure of the various covariant energy density functionals (CEDF). It is found that <b>the</b> <b>uncertainties</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> description of single-particle energies at the two-neutron drip line are dominated by those existing already in known nuclei. Only approximately one third of these uncertainties are due to <b>the</b> <b>uncertainties</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> isovector channel of CEDF's. Thus, improving the CEDF description of single-particle energies in known nuclei will also reduce <b>the</b> <b>uncertainties</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> prediction of the position of two-neutron drip line.

5|$|Fundamental {{physical}} constants {{are often}} highly dependent upon each other. This {{implies that the}} best value of a fundamental physical constant, one with the least uncertainty, often can be determined by directly measuring other fundamental physical constants, from which the value can be calculated. The uncertainty in these constants is then determined from {{the uncertainty of the}} others by the propagation of uncertainty. Constants whose value is fixed, for determining the units in which they are expressed, don't have an uncertainty associated with them, so they do not account for any extra <b>uncertainty</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> value of the calculated constant. One of the reasons the SI unit system will be changed is that determination of values can often be greatly improved if expressed in these new units. This is due to the dependence of these values on physical constants.|$|E
