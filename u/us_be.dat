5|$|It can {{be argued}} that private charity is {{insufficient}} because the benefits from it accrue to people other than those who make the gifts—... a neighborhood effect. I am distressed by the sight of poverty; I am benefited by its alleviation; but I am benefited equally whether I or someone else pays for its alleviation; the benefits of other people's charity therefore partly accrue to me. To put it differently, we might all of <b>us</b> <b>be</b> willing to contribute to the relief of poverty, provided everyone else did. We might not be willing to contribute the same amount without such assurance. In small communities, public pressure can suffice to realize the proviso even with private charity. In the large impersonal communities that are increasingly coming to dominate our society, it is much more difficult for it to do so.|$|E

Before the constitutional convention in 1816, Pennington was quoted as saying [...] "Let <b>us</b> <b>be</b> on our guard when our convention men are chosen that they be men opposed to slavery." [...] At the constitutional convention, the anti-slavery party was able to take control, electing Jennings {{as the president of the}} convention.

500|$|Early European landowners {{were eager}} to secure their {{investment}} in land in southwest Tennessee. Years before Randolph would be founded, wealthy and influential investors tried {{to find ways to}} get a return on their share of land. In 1818, Judge John Overton wrote to General James Winchester that [...] "We must not let the owners of the property on the Bluffs at the Mississippi above <b>us</b> <b>be</b> beforehand in laying off town—as it might damp the sale of ours". Overton and Winchester founded Memphis, Tennessee along with Andrew Jackson in 1819. Overton, Winchester and Jackson were trying to secure investments in property in the Memphis area that they owned and not give the advantage to investors [...] "above", north of Memphis on the Mississippi River, in Randolph. Andrew Jackson (1767–1845) would become the 7th President of the United States in 1829.|$|E
500|$|Jennings and his {{supporters}} had control of the convention and Jennings was elected its president. Other notable delegates at the convention included Dennis Pennington, Davis Floyd, and William Hendricks.

Pennington was quoted as saying [...] "Let <b>us</b> <b>be</b> on our guard when our convention men are chosen that they be men opposed to slavery". They succeeded in their goal and a ban was placed in the new constitution. But, persons already held in bondage stayed in that status for some time. That same year Indiana statehood was approved by Congress. While settlers did not want slavery, they also wanted to exclude free blacks, and established barriers to their immigration to the state.|$|E

Why were the Lal Masjid elements allowed so much leeway that the complex became almost like a state within a state, complete with a moral policing force which acted with impunity enforcing a rigid interpretation of Islam on the city's residents?

500|$|In 1976 a {{friendly}} at Aston Villa was abandoned owing to hooliganism.

Let <b>us</b> <b>be</b> perfectly blunt. The same examples of low animal life who force their support on Glasgow Rangers {{are one and the same}} with the foul-mouthed drunks who cause us great embarrassment every July when they turn up to 'support' our annual rallies". In response, the Rangers manager Willie Waddell declared an intent to change the media perception of Rangers being a sectarian club. While he denied the existence of the signing policy, he stated that [...] "no religious barriers will be put up at this club regarding signing of players" [...] and pledged to remove supporters from Ibrox Stadium who did not accept it. Despite this, no Catholic players were signed by Rangers following it.|$|E
500|$|Baba himself {{maintained}} an ambiguous profile, unwilling {{to identify with}} {{either of the two}} religions. His Muslim devotees were fully convinced that he belonged to their fold, identifying him as an avaliā. The Hindu bhaktas also viewed him as one of them, since he often identified himself with their gods and customs. Sai Baba wanted to belong to all and be shared by all. When pressed on whether he was Hindu or Muslim, he would often get very angry. Once he told a devotee: [...] "You have been with me for eighteen years now. Does Sai mean for you only these three and a half cubits of height?" [...] Sai Baba was able to avoid clashes between the two communities, and, in fact, succeeded in unifying them in an atmosphere of general harmony. In a verse of the midday arti, devotees sing: Baba would often talk about the Hindu gods, quoting from sacred texts or even commenting upon passages of the Bhagavadgita, the Isha Upanishad, and so forth. The names of Krishna and Rama seem to have been particularly dear to him. With his Muslim followers, Baba would always talk of Allah and the Koran, often quoting Persian verses. One of his favorite expressions was [...] "Allah rakhega vaiia rahena", that is, [...] "Let <b>us</b> <b>be</b> content with what we have, and submit our will to Allah." [...] On several occasions, Sai reassured his listeners by saying that he, like them, was but a devotee of Allah, a humble faqir with two arms and two legs. In later years, Parsis and even a few Christians would come to Shirdi. Sai Baba respected all creeds, true to his conviction that all religions are but particular paths leading to one ineffable goal.|$|E
