25|$|Even {{though he}} was working with the caloric theory, Sadi Carnot in 1824 {{suggested}} that some of the caloric available for generating useful work is lost in any real process. In March 1851, while grappling {{to come to terms with}} the work of James Prescott Joule, Lord Kelvin started to speculate that there was an inevitable loss of <b>useful</b> <b>heat</b> in all processes. The idea was framed even more dramatically by Hermann von Helmholtz in 1854, giving birth to the spectre of the heat death of the universe.|$|E
40|$|A novel type II absorption-cycle heat-pump is described. The {{proposed}} cycle utilises {{the partial}} miscibility of some binary mixtures {{to separate the}} volatile working-fluid from the rich absorbent. The feasibility of the cycle is demonstrated by computer simulation of the cycle using cyclohexane and aniline as working fluids. Simulations demonstrated that <b>useful</b> <b>heating</b> could be achieved only over a limited temperature-range and with poor thermodynamic performance. A modification of this cycle, which included an additional distillation step, was shown to improve performance significantly. ...|$|R

40|$|Microwave {{technology}} was a <b>useful</b> <b>heating</b> process {{when applied to}} the recycling of fine stoneware tiles polishing sludge. The manufact processed were characterized by low porosity, much lower than that registered for the same formulation heated with conventional firing. The different microstructure has been explained by considering the selective heating phenomenon generated by microwave irradiation: the SiC particles could heat much faster that the aluminosilicate matrix so that to melt the surroundings {{with a sort of}} encapsulation process. Conventional heating lead to SiC reaction with oxygen promoting its conversion in CO 2 thus creating large pores...|$|R
25|$|Heat {{pumps are}} more {{effective}} for heating than for cooling an interior space if the temperature differential is held equal. This is because the compressor's input energy is also converted to <b>useful</b> <b>heat</b> when in heating mode, and is discharged along with the transported heat via the condenser to the interior space. But for cooling, the condenser is normally outdoors, and the compressor's dissipated work (waste heat) must also be transported to outdoors using more input energy, rather than being put to a useful purpose. For the same reason, opening a food refrigerator or freezer has {{the net effect of}} heating up the room rather than cooling it, because its refrigeration cycle rejects heat to the indoor air. This heat includes the compressor's dissipated work as well as the heat removed from the inside of the appliance.|$|E
2500|$|Nuclear {{power is}} the use of nuclear fission [...] to {{generate}} <b>useful</b> <b>heat</b> and electricity. Fission of uranium produces nearly all economically significant nuclear power. Radioisotope thermoelectric generators form a very small component of energy generation, mostly in specialized applications such as deep space vehicles.|$|E

50|$|Flues are {{adjustable}} and {{are designed}} to release noxious gases to the atmosphere. They often have the disadvantageous effect of releasing <b>useful</b> household <b>heat</b> to the atmosphere when not properly set—the very opposite of why the fire was lit in the first place.|$|R
2500|$|When {{comparing}} {{the performance of}} heat pumps, {{it is best to}} avoid the word [...] "efficiency", which has a very specific thermodynamic definition. The term coefficient of performance (COP) is used to describe the ratio of <b>useful</b> <b>heat</b> movement per work input. Most vapor-compression heat pumps use electrically powered motors for their work input.|$|E
2500|$|When {{used for}} heating a {{building}} with an outside temperature of, for example, 10°C, a typical air-source heat pump (ASHP) has a COP of 3 to 4, whereas an electrical resistance heater has a COP of 1.0. That is, one joule of electrical energy {{will cause a}} resistance heater to produce only one joule of <b>useful</b> <b>heat,</b> while under ideal conditions, one joule of electrical energy can cause a heat pump to move three or four joules of heat from a cooler place to a warmer place. Note that an {{air source heat pump}} is more efficient in hotter climates than cooler ones, so when the weather is much warmer the unit will perform with a higher COP (as it has a smaller temperature gap to bridge). [...] When there is a wide temperature differential between the hot and cold reservoirs, the COP is lower (worse). In extreme cold weather the COP will go down to 1.0.|$|E

5000|$|Ice {{can be used}} as part of an air {{conditioning}} system, using battery- or solar-powered fans to blow hot air over the ice. This is especially <b>useful</b> during <b>heat</b> waves when power is out and standard (electrically powered) air conditioners do not work.|$|R
5000|$|The {{coefficient}} of performance or COP (sometimes CP or CoP) of a [...] heat pump, refrigerator or air conditioning system is a ratio of <b>useful</b> <b>heating</b> or cooling provided to work required. [...] Higher COPs equate to lower operating costs. The COP usually exceeds 1, especially in heat pumps, because, instead of just converting work to heat (which, if 100% efficient, would be a COP_hp of 1), it pumps additional heat from a heat source to where the heat is required. For complete systems, COP calculations should include energy consumption of all power consuming auxiliaries. COP is highly dependent on operating conditions, especially absolute temperature and relative temperature between sink and system, and is often graphed or averaged against expected conditions.|$|R
5000|$|The annual fuel {{utilization}} efficiency (AFUE; pronounced 'A'-'Few' or 'A'-'F'-'U'-'E') is {{a thermal}} efficiency measure of combustion equipment like furnaces, boilers, and water heaters. The AFUE {{differs from the}} true 'thermal efficiency' {{in that it is}} not a steady-state, peak measure of conversion efficiency, but instead attempts to represent the actual, season-long, average efficiency of that piece of equipment, including the operating transients. [...] It is a dimensionless ratio of useful energy output to energy input, expressed as a percentage. For example, a 90% AFUE for a gas furnace means it outputs 90 BTUs of <b>useful</b> <b>heating</b> for every 100 BTUs of natural gas input (where the rest may be wasted heat in the exhaust). A higher AFUE means higher efficiency.|$|R

50|$|The 12C isotopically pure, (or in {{practice}} 15-fold enrichment of isotopic number, 12 over 13 for carbon) diamond gives a 50% higher thermal conductivity than the already high value of 900-2000 W/(m·K) for a normal diamond, which contains the natural isotopic mixture of 98.9% 12C and 1.1% 13C.

5000|$|A [...] "standard" [...] {{domestic}} {{air source}} heat pump can extract <b>useful</b> <b>heat</b> {{down to about}} -15 C.

Additional tests were run at temperatures ranging from 80 to 190 C (176 - 374 F). For the glass mirror reflectors, peak efficiencies, based on aperture area and operating temperatures of 125 C (257 F), were over 40 %. Efficiencies of about 40 % were observed at temperatures of 150 C (302 F) and 30 % at 175 C (347 F).
