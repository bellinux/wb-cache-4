Another project was carried out in 1994 and 1995, <b>uncovering</b> part of the original garden of the tower and the 16th century adjoining timber house, and an architectural survey between 2009 and 2011 determined that one of the wooden doors on the second floor was probably an original feature from 1365.|$|E

40|$|The <b>uncovered</b> set has {{frequently}} been proposed {{as a solution}} concept for decision-making environments where majority rule is being used. It coincides with the core when the core exists, and is always {{a subset of the}} Pareto set. Theory suggests that sophisticated decision makers using majority rule will propose only outcomes in the <b>uncovered</b> set. A difficulty in computing the <b>uncovered</b> set for any particular set of spatial preferences has been an obstacle to rigorous laboratory experiments on the <b>uncovered</b> set as a solution concept. Recently, researchers developed a grid search based method to estimate the <b>uncovered</b> set at a satisfactory level of precision. This paper reports computer-mediated, free-communication, five-person laboratory experiments with two configurations of preferences. The results suggest that majority rule does in fact produce outcomes overwhelmingly in the <b>uncovered</b> set. Furthermore, when preferences shift, outcomes track the <b>uncovered</b> set. While outcomes tend to occur within the <b>uncovered</b> set, they are not necessarily stable; majority dominance relationships still produce instability, albeit constrained by the <b>uncovered</b> set...|$|R

40|$|We {{prove the}} {{existence}} of a social choice function implementable via backward induction which always selects within the ultimate <b>uncovered</b> set. Whereas the <b>uncovered</b> set is the set of maximal elements of the covering relation, the ultimate <b>uncovered</b> set is the set obtained by iterative application of this covering operation. Dutta and Sen (1993) showed that any social choice function which is the solution of a generalized binary voting procedure is implementable via backward induction. Our result follows from Dutta and Sen's theorem, in that we construct a binary voting procedure always selecting within the ultimate <b>uncovered</b> set. We use the classical multistage elimination procedure, which always selects an alternative within the <b>uncovered</b> set. When this procedure is also used to select among all of the possible agendas or orderings of alternatives within the procedure, the alternative selected (from the agenda selected) will be within the <b>uncovered</b> set of the <b>uncovered</b> set. Our result follows from repeated application of this construction. Intuitively, the procedure constructed consists of requiring agents to vote on how they should vote and so on.
