25|$|The {{sacrifice}} {{of a bear}} for Artemis started with the Brauron cult. Every year a girl between five and ten years of age was sent to Artemis' temple at Brauron. The Byzantine writer Suidos relayed the legend in Arktos e Brauroniois. A bear was tamed by Artemis and introduced {{to the people of}} Athens. They touched it and played with it <b>until</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> a group of girls poked the bear until it attacked them. A brother of one of the girls killed the bear, so Artemis sent a plague in revenge. The Athenians consulted an oracle to understand how to end the plague. The oracle suggested that, in payment for the bear's blood, no Athenian virgin should be allowed to marry until she had served Artemis in her temple ('played the bear for the goddess').|$|E
25|$|As a teenager, he {{was greatly}} {{troubled by the}} Metaphysics of Aristotle, which he could not {{understand}} until he read al-Farabi's commentary on the work. For {{the next year and}} a half, he studied philosophy, in which he encountered greater obstacles. In such moments of baffled inquiry, he would leave his books, perform the requisite ablutions, then go to the mosque, and continue in prayer till light broke on his difficulties. Deep into the night, he would continue his studies, and even in his dreams problems would pursue him and work out their solution. Forty times, it is said, he read through the Metaphysics of Aristotle, till the words were imprinted on his memory; but their meaning was hopelessly obscure, <b>until</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> they found illumination, from the little commentary by Farabi, which he bought at a bookstall for the small sum of three dirhams. So great was his joy at the discovery, made {{with the help of a}} work from which he had expected only mystery, that he hastened to return thanks to God, and bestowed alms upon the poor.|$|E
25|$|Callum, who was {{battling for}} custody over Max, {{attacked}} David and the Platt family for months <b>until</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> when, after the Platt's {{return from a}} week-long holiday, Sarah Platt was babysitting Max. Whilst they were watching a scary movie, Gemma Winter, Callum's friend, came {{knocking at the door}} of Callum's flat. She had been beaten up by a thug. When Max was playing in his room, he found Callum's gun. Callum threatened Sarah that if she told anyone about the gun then he would release a video of Bethany dealing and taking drugs to the police. Sarah flees with Max, refused to speak to anyone about it and told Bethany to stay away from him. However, he continued threatening the Platts. Sarah confided in Jason Grimshaw to finish him off. He attacked Callum in the Rovers and told him to stay away. He was then arrested for possession of the gun but was released without charge due to lack of evidence. When Callum arrived at the Platts' house to collect Max, David and Jason prevented him. Furious, Callum and two of his thugs lead Jason into the ginnel and beat him up. Sarah found Jason and called an ambulance. Jason's parents Eileen and Tony were told that he might not walk or talk again. Max, who had witnessed the attack on Jason, told David and Kylie what he saw after he appeared terrified when Callum came to collect him. Max gave a statement to the police. Before Callum was arrested, he spiked Sarah's drink and knocked her unconscious. He threatened Bethany that he would kill Sarah if she did not lie for him. The day after, on Lily Platt's 2nd birthday, Bethany revealed to the Platts that she made a statement against Max. The family was disgusted as they knew she was lying. Sarah informed Tony about Callum and the following day, he took matters into his own hands by beating up Callum in the ginnel, only to be stopped by Liz. Callum continued to attack the Platts because he needed money to pay off a dangerous drug dealer. Sarah lures him to the house and records what he is saying. Callum finds her 'phone and starts attacking Sarah, and Kylie comes in and beats him over the head with a wrench, killing him. They bury his body in a manhole in the garage and Sarah is traumatized.|$|E

500|$|After the February Revolution she {{was renamed}} Svobodnaya Rossiya ( [...] , [...] "Free Russia") on 29 April 1917.

The ship was scuttled on 19 June 1918 by four torpedoes {{fired by the}} destroyer [...] in Novorossiysk harbor to prevent her from being {{turned over to the}} Germans as required by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. The fourth torpedo caused a massive explosion and she capsized and sank in four minutes. No attempt was made to salvage her during the 1920s, but the 12-inch shells were salvaged from her wreck. Explosive charges were used to gain access to her magazines <b>until</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> in 1930 when a charge set off a torpedo warhead, which caused a nearby powder magazine to explode, throwing a column of water [...] into the air. No one was injured, but salvage work of this type ceased, although parts of her engines and boilers were later salvaged.|$|E
500|$|The {{theoretical}} biologist Mary Jane West-Eberhard {{reviewed the}} book in detail for the Quarterly Review of Biology as a work [...] "of special significance".

She wrote that Wilson had [...] "assumed god-like powers with this book", attempting to reformulate {{the foundations of the}} social sciences, making ethology and comparative psychology obsolete, and restructuring behavioural biology. She marvelled at the [...] "sustained enthusiasm and authoritativeness" [...] across a wide range of fields not Wilson's own, and the usefulness of many of the chapters. [...] "In this book sociobiology is a patchwork neatly stitched from relevant pieces of other fields, without a bold new theoretical pattern of its own". She objected strongly to what she considered Wilson's [...] "confused and misleading" [...] discussion of altruism and group selection, arguing that kin selection provided an alternative (fully Darwinian) explanation and that Wilson was wrong to make it seem that group selection was necessary.|$|E

500|$|The season {{also saw}} {{several of the}} show's cast write their own episodes. Series co-star Gillian Anderson {{directed}} and wrote her first episode of the series, [...] "all things". Anderson originally approached Carter about writing and directing an episode of the series during the sixth season. Anderson crafted a script that would see Scully pursuing a [...] "deeply personal X-File, one which in [...] is taken down a spiritual path when logic fails her". Anderson had only a rough outline of the script <b>until</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> she wrote {{a majority of the}} story in one sitting. She explained, [...] "A certain concept began to form, [...] I just wrote the entire outline for 'all things' right then and there. It all just kind of came together on the page". The next day, Anderson pitched the script to Carter, who approved of the [...] "personal and quiet" [...] characteristics of the story. In addition, series regular Davis wrote his only episode, [...] "En Ami". Davis approached Carter with his idea about Cigarette Smoking Man trying to seduce Scully with medical knowledge, and Carter, who was intrigued, responded positively to the idea. He assigned executive producer Spotnitz to work with Davis and craft a full-fledged script. The script went through many revisions. Because Cigarette Smoking Man was able to manipulate Scully, Carter later referred to the [...] "En Ami" [...] as [...] "the creepiest episode of the year." ...|$|E

500|$|Since García Márquez was eighteen, he {{had wanted}} to write a novel based on his grandparents' house where he grew up. However, he {{struggled}} with finding an appropriate tone and put off the idea <b>until</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> the answer hit him while driving his family to Acapulco. [...] He turned the car around and the family returned home so he could begin writing. [...] He sold his car so his family would have money to live on while he wrote, but writing the novel took far longer than he expected, and he wrote every day for eighteen months. His wife had to ask for food on credit from their butcher and their baker as well as nine months of rent on credit from their landlord. During the eighteen months of writing, García Márquez met with two couples, Eran Carmen and Álvaro Mutis, and María Luisa Elío and Jomí García Ascot, every night and discussed the progress of the novel, trying out different versions. Fortunately, when the book was finally published in 1967 it became his most commercially successful novel, One Hundred Years of Solitude, which sold more than 30 million copies (Cien años de soledad) (1967; English translation by Gregory Rabassa 1970) and was dedicated “Para (to) Jomí García Ascot y María Luisa Elío”. The story chronicles several generations of the Buendía family from the time they founded the fictional South American village of Macondo, through their trials and tribulations, instances of incest, births and deaths. The history of Macondo is often generalized by critics to represent rural towns throughout Latin America or at least near García Márquez's native Aracataca.|$|E
