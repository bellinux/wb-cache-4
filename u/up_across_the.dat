Vehicles, private buildings, homes, and streets are decorated with national flags, candles, oil lamps, pennants and buntings. Businesses engage in rigorous marketing, as do leading designer fashion outlets which stock independence-themed clothing, jewellery and self-adornments.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1980s, more {{resistance}} movements {{supported by}} Ethiopia's communist Derg administration had sprung <b>up</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> country. Barre responded by ordering punitive measures against those he perceived as locally supporting the guerillas, {{especially in the}} northern regions. The clampdown included bombing of cities, with the northwestern administrative center of Hargeisa, a Somali National Movement (SNM) stronghold, among the targeted areas in 1988.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of the storm, all {{ports in}} Gujarat, {{including}} Kandla, {{one of the}} largest in the country, were closed as a precautionary measure. On May25, over 10,000 people were evacuated from coastal areas in the threatened region. Throughout India, a total of 118,800 people were evacuated and 100,000 more were evacuated in Pakistan. The Indian military was placed on standby to undertake search-and-rescue missions immediately after the storms' passage. Fourteen districts of Gujarat were placed on red alert, the highest level of preparedness. Seven emergency control centers were set <b>up</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> country and officials alerted hospitals and fire crews about the approaching storm.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, Barre's regime had become {{increasingly}} unpopular. The authorities became ever more totalitarian, and resistance movements, encouraged by Ethiopia's communist Derg administration, sprang <b>up</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> country. This eventually led in 1991 to {{the outbreak of}} the civil war, the toppling of Barre's government, and the disbandment of the Somali National Army. Many of the opposition groups subsequently began competing for influence in the power vacuum that followed the ouster of Barre's regime. Armed factions led by United Somali Congress commanders General Mohamed Farah Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed, in particular, clashed as each sought to exert authority over the capital.|$|E

5|$|Castro's {{government}} emphasised social {{projects to}} improve Cuba's standard of living, often {{to the detriment}} of economic development. Major emphasis was placed on education, and during the first 30 months of Castro's government, more classrooms were opened than in the previous 30 years. The Cuban primary education system offered a work-study program, with half of the time spent in the classroom, and the other half in a productive activity. Health care was nationalized and expanded, with rural health centers and urban polyclinics opening <b>up</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> island to offer free medical aid. Universal vaccination against childhood diseases was implemented, and infant mortality rates were reduced dramatically. A third part of this social program was the improvement of infrastructure. Within {{the first six months of}} Castro's government, 600 miles of roads were built across the island, while $300 million was spent on water and sanitation projects. Over 800 houses were constructed every month in the early years of the administration in an effort to cut homelessness, while nurseries and day-care centers were opened for children and other centers opened for the disabled and elderly.|$|E
5|$|During the storm, roughly 50,500 people {{sought refuge}} in shelters set <b>up</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> country. Throughout the Philippines, 47 {{people were killed}} by the typhoon, mostly from drowning. Sixteen of these {{fatalities}} occurred in Isabela Province, where Elsie made landfall. Heavy rains triggered several landslides across mountainous areas of the country. High winds also created deadly air-borne debris, including roofing and tree limbs. Downed power lines across the northern provinces left most of Luzon without power. Officials stated that about 61,300 homes were either damaged or destroyed by Elsie in the Philippines. In the wake of the typhoon, roughly 332,000 people were left homeless. Damages sustained by agriculture amounted to 105million PHP ($2,253,702 USD). In all, Typhoon Elsie killed 47 people and injured 363 others in the Philippines, and left roughly $35.4million in damages.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{residents}} across Guam {{were critical}} of the delayed response by the U.S. government; no aid had arrived within two days of the storm, but unsafe conditions at airports had prevented aircraft from landing. With the majority of homes destroyed across Guam, structures that remained standing were used as temporary shelter for those left homeless. Similarly, damaged military installations at Anderson Air Force Base were made available to all civilians. By November14, the USS Daniel I. Sultan arrived in Guam with 1,100troops to provide emergency power. A U.S. Air Force AC-130 landed on the island that day carrying the first package of relief supplies. About 400troops and 80public works employees were sent from Hawaii on November14. The Red Cross and civil defense offices were placed in charge of coordinating recovery efforts. Water distribution centers were set <b>up</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> island to provide residents with clean drinking water.|$|E

5|$|It {{is not an}} {{administrative}} building but a civic suite, Lord Mayor's parlour and Council chamber; local government administration is centred at the nearby Municipal Buildings. The town hall was built between 1749 and 1754 to a design by John Wood the Elder replacing an earlier town hall nearby. An extension to the north designed by James Wyatt was added in 1785. Following a fire in 1795 the hall was largely rebuilt and a dome designed by Wyatt was built. Minor alterations have subsequently been made. The streets surrounding its site have altered since its initiation, notably when viewed from Castle Street, the south-side, it appears as off-centre. This is because Water Street which ran to the junction with Dale Street, the west-east axis, was continuous and built <b>up</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> junction so that the town hall was not visible originally from that aspect. The structures were removed 150 years after this to expose the building from this position.|$|E
5|$|The {{description}} {{provided by}} Blake to Humphrey {{explains that the}} work depicts the resurrection. The top of the work depicts Christ on the Throne of Judgement with Heaven opened <b>up</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> painting. Behind Christ are the heads of infants which represent creation coming from Jesus. Christ is surrounded by the four Zoas and seven angels that have vials filled with God's wrath. An image of a tabernacle with a cross inside is depicted above Christ. An image of baptism is to Christ's right and the Last Supper is to Christ's left with both representing eternal life. Further to Christ's right is {{the resurrection of the}} just and to the left is the resurrection and subsequent fall of the wicked. Adam and Eve are below Christ, and Abraham and Moses are nearby. Below Moses is Satan wrapped by the Serpent and in the centre is the book of death. At the top is the book of life, and the Christian Church is the figure of a woman on top of the moon.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Charley in Jamaica {{included}} one fatality {{and at least}} $1million in damages. Forming out of a tropical wave on August9, 2004, Charley quickly tracked through the eastern Caribbean Sea and attained tropical storm status on August10. While passing south of Jamaica on August11, the storm was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane. During its passage of Jamaica, Charley had maximum winds of 75mph (120km/h), a low-end Category 1 hurricane. Turning north, the storm impacted western Cuba as a Category 3 storm before making landfall in Florida as a strong Category 4. The storm eventually dissipated on August15. As Charley approached Jamaica, officials issued tropical storm watches and warnings before issuing a hurricane watch. Two cruise ships were diverted from docking in Jamaica, affecting 5,700 passengers. Numerous shelters were set <b>up</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> island; however, relatively few people sought refuge in them.|$|E
