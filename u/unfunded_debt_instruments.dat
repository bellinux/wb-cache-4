40|$|The bill of exchange, the {{promissory}} note and the cheque are <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> {{regulated by the}} bill of exchange law. The <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> are differentiated from other instruments used in civil and commercial relations by {{the inclusion of the}} <b>debt</b> in the <b>instrument,</b> hence the name of <b>debt</b> <b>instrument.</b> The main features of the <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> are: formal, literal and autonomous nature. The <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> are formal {{in the sense that the}} creation, the existence, the circulation and the exercise and the use of the patrimonial rights included depend on the existence of the elements included in the instrument. Moreover, the high rigorous nature of the <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> is reflected by the obligation to meet some requirements regarding the form (the bill of exchange, the {{promissory note}} and the cheque imply some compulsory requirements in order to be valid). The <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> are literal, in the sense that the existence and the coverage of the patrimonial rights are established through the wording included in the instrument; thus, the juridical relation that caused the issuing of the <b>debt</b> <b>instrument</b> no longer influences the right deriving from the instrument (whether a sales-purchase agreement, or a loan or a debt opening); no possibility for the <b>debt</b> <b>instrument</b> to be interpreted or completed with other documents. The autonomous nature of the <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> can be seen, on the one hand, in relation to the fundamental juridical relation that caused it, and in this case, we shall consider that the individual who issued the instrument has an obligation which is not under the existing fundamental relation but exclusively under the instrument which the individual signed; on the other hand, each new signatory has an autonomous juridical position and acquires a new, original right, not a transferred right. The autonomy of the <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> explains the principle according to which the holder of the instrument exercises one’s own right and exceptions cannot be opposed to him, namely the protection measures that could be opposed to the previous holders (principle of non-opposability of exceptions) ...|$|R

40|$|As U. S. Treasury {{securities}} {{carry the}} full faith and credit of the U. S. government, {{they are free}} of default risk. Thus, their yields are risk-free rates of return, which allows the most recently issued U. S. Treasury securities {{to be used as}} a benchmark to price other fixed-income instruments. This article analyzes the time series properties of interest rates on U. S. Treasury benchmarks and related <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> by modelling the conditional mean and conditional volatility for weekly yields on 12 Treasury Bills and other <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> for the period January 8, 1982 to August 20, 2004. The conditional correlations between all pairs of <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> are also calculated. These estimates are of interest as they enable an assessment of the implications of modelling conditional volatility on forecasting performance. The estimated conditional correlation coefficients indicate whether there is specialization, diversification, or independence in the <b>debt</b> <b>instrument</b> shocks. Constant conditional correlation estimates of the standardized shocks indicate that the shocks to the first differences in the <b>debt</b> <b>instrument</b> yields are generally high and always positively correlated. In general, the primary purpose in holding a portfolio of Treasury Bills and other <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> should be to specialize on instruments that provide the largest returns. Tests for Stochastic Dominance are generally consistent with these findings, but find somewhat surprising rankings between <b>debt</b> <b>instruments,</b> with implications for portfolio composition. Thirty year treasuries, Aaa bonds, and mortgages tend to dominate the other instruments, at least to the second order.

50|$|Britain {{generally}} funded its wars {{by issuing}} debt rather than raising taxes. This was a strategy Britain had employed in funding its wars {{since the early}} 18th century. Britain financed its war expenditures by issuing a combination of <b>unfunded</b> and funded <b>debt.</b> <b>Unfunded</b> <b>debt,</b> short-term obligations not funded by interest payments {{on the part of}} the borrower, included army, ordinance, navy, and exchequer bills and was more costly for the treasury to repay than longer-term debt. Funded debt, long-term obligations funded through interest payments made by the borrower over the term of the loan, was primarily used to retire more costly, short-term debt. This helped to lengthen the term of the debt and reduce the government’s debt service payments.|$|R

6000|$|The {{interest}} of debt contracted {{during the war}} is stated by the author at 2,614,892l. The particulars appear in pp. 14 and 15. Among them is stated the <b>unfunded</b> <b>debt,</b> 9,975,017l., supposed to carry interest on a medium at 3 per cent, which amounts to 299,250l. We are referred to the [...] "Considerations on the Trade and Finances of the Kingdom," [...] p. 22, for the particulars of that <b>unfunded</b> <b>debt.</b> Turn to the work, and to the place referred to by the author himself, {{if you have a}} mind to see a clear detection of a capital fallacy of this article in his account. You will there see that this <b>unfunded</b> <b>debt</b> consists of the nine following articles: the remaining subsidy to the Duke of Brunswick; the remaining dédommagement to the Landgrave of Hesse; the German demands; the army and ordnance extraordinaries; the deficiencies of grants and funds; Mr. Touchet's claim; the debts due to Nova Scotia and Barbadoes; exchequer bills; and navy debt. The extreme fallacy of this state cannot escape any reader who will be at the pains to compare the interest money, with which he affirms us to have been loaded, in his [...] "State of the Nation," [...] with the items of the principal debt to which he refers in his [...] "Considerations." [...] The reader must observe, that of this long list of nine articles, only two, the exchequer bills, and part of the navy debt, carried any interest at all. The first amounted to 1,800,000l.; and this undoubtedly carried interest. The whole navy debt indeed amounted to 4,576,915l.; but of this only a part carried interest. The author of the [...] "Considerations," [...] &c. labors to prove this very point in p. 18; and Mr. G. has always defended himself upon the same ground, for the insufficient provision he made for the discharge of that debt.

The presentation focuses on areas of bank’s activity in the treasury <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> (bills) and T-bonds market.

40|$|The {{definition}} of deposit substitutes in Philippine tax law fails {{to consider the}} maturity of a <b>debt</b> <b>instrument.</b> This {{makes it possible for}} long-term bonds to be considered as deposit substitutes if they meet the 20 -lender rule, taxable at 20 % final tax. However, long-term <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> cannot realistically function as deposit substitutes even if they fall in the hands of 20 or more lenders. First, long-term <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> cannot simultaneously replicate the twin features of capital preservation and liquidity, which are integral to the nature of a deposit substitute. Second, deposit substitutes {{are an integral part of}} the maturity transformation process (i. e. short-term borrowing for the purpose of long-term lending) in financial intermediaries, which means that they should have low borrowing cost, made possible only by having short-term maturity. To prove these propositions, this paper situates the function of deposit substitutes within the context of shadow banking, where said instruments originated and are generally used. To show the incompatibility between a deposit substitute and a long-term <b>debt</b> <b>instrument,</b> the paper applies the fundamental theory of bond values to 10 -year zero-coupon treasury notes called 'PEACe Bonds' in Banco De Oro, et al. vs. Republic (2015 and 2016).
