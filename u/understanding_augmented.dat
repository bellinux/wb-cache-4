40|$|YesThis chapter {{deals with}} a range of issues related to the {{structure}} and appearance of Augmented Public Space in terms of framing. It also develops key theoretical perspectives concerning the ways that information and media content is superimposed onto the urban environment. In doing so, it analyses the importance of locality on the character of display and argues {{that in the long run}} it is the body that is central to the framing of content and so is crucial to our <b>understanding</b> of <b>augmented</b> public space. This is exemplified in the widespread adoption of urban screens in UK city centres which forms a case study, but is not exclusive in its application to urban screens.

25|$|It is {{also argued}} that this <b>augmented</b> <b>understanding</b> of {{etiology}} will lead to better remediation and rehabilitation strategies through {{an understanding of the}} different levels in the causal process where one can intervene. It may be that non-organic interventions, like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), better attenuate disorders alone or in conjunction with drugs. Linden's (2006) demonstration of how psychotherapy has neurobiological commonalities with pharmacotherapy is a pertinent example of this and is encouraging from a patient perspective as the potentiality for pernicious side effects is decreased while self-efficacy is increased.|$|R
40|$|We {{increase}} our <b>understanding</b> of <b>augmenting</b> a cellular immune response, {{by using an}} HIV- 1 protease-derived epitope (PR 75 − 84), and variants thereof, coupled to the C-terminal, of the B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB). Fusion proteins were used for immunizations of HLA-A 0201 transgenic C 57 BL/ 6 mice. We observed different capacities to elicit a cellular immune response by peptides with additions of five to ten amino acids to the PR epitope. There was {{a positive correlation between}} the magnitude of the elicited cellular immune response and the capacity of the fusion protein to bind GM- 1. This binding capacity is affected by its ability to form natural pentamers of CTB. Our results suggest that functional CTB pentamers containing a foreign amino acid-modified epitope is a novel way to overcome the limited cellular immunogenicity of minimal peptide antigens. This way of using a functional assay as readout for improved cellular immunogenicity might become highly valuable for difficult immunogens such as short peptides (epitopes) ...|$|R

A high-level industry analysis of Canadian medical-doctoral universities, based on Porter 2 ̆ 7 s five forces and value chain analysis, combined with an analysis of pertinent issues indicated that universities are greatly affected by strategic decisions imposed by government. Examples of these include movement towards a userpay environment and increased co-funding research relations with industry. Other influences outside of the control of universities, such as demographic impacts to customer base and human resources, also play a role. Through the use of similar analytic approaches, business administrators in universities can study the decisions and influences for future trends and their impacts and derive an <b>understanding</b> to <b>augment</b> their knowledge in order to compensate, prepare for and possibly eliminate negative impacts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} a {{computational}} approach to <b>understanding</b> and <b>augmenting</b> the conversational knowledge process that is a collective activity for knowledge creation, management, and application, where conversational communications are used as a primary means of interaction among participating agents. The key idea is conversation quantization, a technique of approximating a continuous flow of conversation {{by a series of}} conversation quanta that represent points of the discourse. Conversation quantization enables to implement a rather robust conversation system by basing it on a large amount of conversation quanta collected from the real world. We make clear the nature of conversation quanta by extracting them from practical situations by hand. Based on the preliminary experiments, {{we present a}} method for automatic extraction of the first approximation of conversation quanta. To support the conversational knowledge process, we have developed the Sustainable Knowledge Globe (SKG) that can manage conversation quanta by switching an overlooking sphere view and a conversational agent in an immersive view. We discuss effectiveness of SKG based on an experiment...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe story base {{interpretation}} is subjectively summarised and segmented from the first-person viewpoint. However, we often need to objectively represent an entire image by integrated knowledge. Yet, {{this is a}} difficult task. We proposed a novel approach, named the synthetic evidential study (SES), for <b>understanding</b> and <b>augmenting</b> collective thought processes through substantiated thought by interactive media. In this study, we investigated the kind of data that can be obtained through the SES sessions as interpretation archives and whether the database is useful to understand multiple story timelines. For the purpose, we designed a machine-readable interpretation data format and developed support systems to create and provide data that are easy to understand. We conducted an experiment using the simulation of the projection phase in SES sessions. From the results, we suggested that a “meta comment” which was deepened interpretation comment by the others in the interpretation archives to have been posted when it was necessary to consider other participants’ interpretation to broaden their horizons before posting the comment. In addition, the construction of networks to represent the relationships between the interpretation comments enabled us to suggest the important comments by using the degree centrality...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} layered Finite State Transducer (FST) {{framework}} integrating hierarchical supra-lexical linguistic knowledge into speech recognition based on shallow parsing. The shallow parsing grammar is derived {{directly from the}} full fledged grammar for natural language <b>understanding,</b> and <b>augmented</b> with top-level n-gram probabilities and phrase-level context-dependent probabilities, which is beyond the standard context-free grammar (CFG) formalism. Such a shallow parsing approach can help balance sufficient grammar coverage and tight structure constraints. The context-dependent probabilistic shallow parsing model is represented by layered FSTs, which can be integrated with speech recognition seamlessly to impose early phrase-level structural constraints consistent with natural language understanding. It is shown that in the JUPITER [1] weather information domain, the shallow parsing model achieves lower recognition word error rates, compared to a regular class n-gram model with the same order. However, we find that, with a higher order top-level n-gram model, pre-composition and optimization of the FSTs are highly restricted by the computational resources available. Given the potential of such models, it may be worth pursing an incremental approximation strategy [2], which includes part of the linguistic model FST in early optimization, while introducing the complete model through dynamic composition...|$|R
40|$|In chemistry, {{molecules}} {{are drawn}} {{on paper and}} chalkboards as diagrams consisting of lines, letters, and symbols which represent not only the atoms and bonds in the molecules but concisely encode cues to the 3 D geometry of the molecules. Recent efforts into pen-based input methods for chemistry software have made progress at allowing chemists to input 2 D diagrams of molecules into a computer simply by drawing them on a digitizer tablet. However, the task of interpreting these parsed sketches into proper 3 D models has been largely unsolved due to the difficulty in making the models satisfy both the natural properties of molecule structure and the geometric cues made explicit in the drawing. This dissertation presents a set of techniques developed to solve this model construction problem {{within the context of}} an educational application for chemistry students. Our primary contribution is a framework for combining molecular structure knowledge and molecule diagram <b>understanding</b> via <b>augmenting</b> molecular mechanics equations to include drawing-based penalty terms. Additionally, we present an algorithm for generating molecule models from drawn diagrams which leverages domainspecific and diagram-driven heuristics. These heuristics make our process fast and accurate enough for molecule diagram drawing to be used as an interactive technique for model construction o...|$|R

Specifically, we test seven hypotheses and find strong evidence that both architectural and specialized marketing capabilities, and their integration, positively mediate the product-market strategy and derived business unit performance relationship. In contrast to many extant studies, both survey and objectively measured data are combined, and because the secondary data collected contains both resource-level (input) data and subsequent one-year financial data, a higher level of confidence may be attributable to our findings...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} paper is to give a better <b>understanding</b> of why <b>Augmented</b> Soft Tissue Mobilization (ASTM) may be so successful through discussion of the inflammation and healing process, traditional forms of treatment, such as transverse friction massage and the rationale behind ASTM. The body responds immediately to trauma at the time of an injury. This basic response is the inflammatory response. Out of this response, the body lays down scar to reinforce damaged areas. Scar can often be painful and hinder normal function. Treatments of scar have included massage. Based on known theories of how the body responds to stress applied to soft tissue, arises the rationale for ASTM. Since ASTM is still being researched, it should be viewed as aiding traditional forms of treatment, not replacing them. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R

Until recently, most public health professionals in English-speaking countries were unaware that their colleagues in Latin America had developed an entire field of inquiry and practice devoted to making these links more clearly understood. The Latin American Social Medicine (LASM) database finally bridges this previous gap. Description This public health informatics case study describes the key features of a unique information resource intended to improve access to LASM literature and to <b>augment</b> <b>understanding</b> about the social determinants of health. This case study includes both quantitative and qualitative evaluation data. Currently the LASM database at The University of New Mexico [URL] brings important information, originally known mostly within professional networks located in Latin American countries to public health professionals worldwide via the Internet. The LASM database uses Spanish, Portuguese, and English language trilingual, structured abstracts to summarize classic and contemporary works.

40|$|Whilst {{canonical}} {{literature has}} been used in conjunction with legal history, there is very little direct discussion of the broader methodological issues involved in doing so. This paper seeks to redress that balance by analysing a range of inter-disciplinary approaches and studies. After consideration of Richard Posner’s critique of depictions of law in literature, it is argued that, viewed in isolation, their significance in terms of the history of legal doctrine, procedural technicalities and institutional structures is limited. More broadly, however, and notwithstanding the abstract nature of the cultural inter-relationship between law and literature, it is possible to use literary sources to illuminate legal history. First, legal historians have used literature to provide cultural comparators and points of reference in order to offer fresh perspectives on the past. Second, at a more conceptual level, law and literature studies have <b>augmented</b> <b>understanding</b> {{of the ways in which}} literature has influenced the evolution of legal history. Third, recent developments in socio-cultural history have demonstrated that when literature is used in conjunction with other non-fictional sources, it has significant potential in constructing wider social and cultural contexts and analyses, which can then provide new insights into legal history...|$|R
