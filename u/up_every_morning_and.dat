2500|$|Banville {{is highly}} scathing {{of all of}} his work, stating of his books: [...] "I hate them all ... I loathe them. They're all a {{standing}} embarrassment." [...] Instead of dwelling on the past he is continually looking forward, [...] "You have to crank yourself <b>up</b> <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> {{think about all the}} awful stuff you did yesterday, and how you can compensate for that by doing better today." [...] He does not read reviews of his work as he already knows – [...] "better than any reviewer" [...] – the places in which its faults lie.|$|E
2500|$|Erickson was an irrepressible {{practical}} joker, {{and it was}} {{not uncommon}} for him to slip indirect suggestions into all kinds of situations, including in his own books, papers, lectures and seminars. For example, a student arrived at one of the five-day intensive seminars he held in his home office {{near the end of his}} life. When Erickson asked why she had come, she replied frankly: [...] "My teacher told me that I should come to see you before you died." [...] Erickson smiled and said: [...] "You tell him that dying is the last thing I intend to do." [...] The group laughed at the pun. Then Erickson said, with a twinkle in his eye, [...] "Do you want to know how to avoid dying? Always wake <b>up</b> <b>every</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>And</b> do you want to know how to ensure that you will wake up every morning?", he continued, [...] "Drink lots of liquids before you go to sleep!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot help it," [...] said Clym, in {{a troubled}} tone. [...] "Mother, I hate the flashy business. Talk about men who deserve the name, can any man deserving the name waste {{his time in}} that effeminate way, when he sees half the world going to ruin for want of {{somebody}} to buckle to and {{teach them how to}} breast the misery they are born to? I get <b>up</b> <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> see the whole creation groaning and travailing in pain, as St. Paul says, and yet there am I, trafficking in glittering splendours with wealthy women and titled libertines, and pandering to the meanest vanities--I, who have health and strength enough for anything. I have been troubled in my mind about it all the year, and the end is that I cannot do it any more." ...|$|E

6000|$|... [Picture: Sea-side scene] It is {{the same}} {{when you go to}} the sea-side. I always determine—when {{thinking}} over the matter in London—that I’ll get <b>up</b> early <b>every</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>and</b> go and have a dip before breakfast, and I religiously pack up a pair of drawers and a bath towel. I always get red bathing drawers. I rather fancy myself in red drawers. They suit my complexion so. But when I get to the sea I don’t feel somehow that I want that early morning bathe nearly so much as I did when I was in town.|$|R

6000|$|I {{am taking}} life easy, now, and I mean {{to keep it}} up for awhile. I don't work at night any more. I told the [...] "Call" [...] folks to pay me $25 a week and let me work only in daylight. So I get <b>up</b> at ten <b>every</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>and</b> quit work at five or six in the afternoon. You ask if I work for greenbacks? Hardly. What do you suppose I could do with greenbacks here? ...|$|R

I don't mean waking <b>up</b> <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> at five-thirty <b>and</b> throwing {{cold water on}} yourself until you're blue. Sorcerers understand discipline as the capacity to face with serenity odds that {{are not included in}} our expectations. For them, discipline is an art: the art of facing infinity without flinching, not because they are strong and tough but because they are filled with awe." [...] ~The Active Side of Infinity ...|$|R
5000|$|One of Zaleski's main {{subjects}} is prayer, {{which he}} has described in a television interview as [...] "communication between the human and transcendent realms, an act that for most people means talking with a personal God, coming into {{the presence of a}} Person who cares about them and loves them and can offer them help. This communication may in time become a two-way street, as God responds. Vast numbers of people report this sort of experience and make it the basis of their daily lives, people who wake <b>up</b> <b>every</b> <b>morning,</b> pray, <b>and</b> believe that they have been in communion with God. They pray to God and receive an answer. And this relationship makes people profoundly happy, which tells us that prayer is something essential to our nature, as if it were hardwired in us." ...|$|R

I have to shut myself <b>up</b> <b>every</b> Wednesday <b>morning,</b> <b>and</b> hand the house over to Mrs. Crutch, the housekeeper, who comes out in a miraculous brown silk gown, to shew it to visitors. On other days, you'll find Mrs. Crutch quite civil and useful;--but on Wednesdays, she is majestic. Charles always goes off among his sheep on that day, and I shut myself up with a pile of books in a little room. You will have to be imprisoned with me. I do so long to peep at the visitors." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{spite of}} his resolve to stop the {{criminal}} element, {{it was not uncommon}} for Woodyard to be approached by those he had arrested and thanked for his actions, telling him that the arrest served as a wake-up call to change their lives.

I have a good many friends in London and abroad who are kind to me, who keep me informed, send me odd bits of {{information}} not available for every one, and it amuses me to put these things together {{in my mind and}} to try and play the prophet. I was in the Foreign Office once, you know. I take <b>up</b> my paper <b>every</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>and</b> it is one of my chief interests to see how near my own speculations come to the truth.

50|$|She survives this ordeal without breaking; and, for her pains, Satan {{offers to}} grant Margarita her deepest wish. Margarita selflessly chooses to {{liberate}} a woman whom she {{met at the}} ball from the woman's eternal punishment: the woman was raped and had later suffocated her newborn by stuffing a handkerchief in its mouth. Her punishment was to wake <b>up</b> <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> find the same handkerchief lying on her nightstand. Satan grants her first wish and offers her another, citing that the first wish was unrelated to Margarita's own desires. For her second wish, she chooses to liberate the Master and live in poverty-stricken love with him.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, Veenstra left Radio 538 {{and started}} work for Kink FM with the shows Sunday Bloody Sunday and Outlaw Classix. When {{the parent company}} Veronica {{restarted}} Radio Veronica in 2002, Veenstra transferred to this new station. The station transmitted {{on a small scale}} through cable only, and for over a year, he was the only DJ on air. During the summer of 2003, Radio Veronica was merged with Sky Radio. At the new Radio Veronica, Veenstra presented Veenstra uit de veren (Veenstra gets <b>up)</b> <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> between 04.00 <b>and</b> 06.00. With Alexander Stevens, he was also a sidekick for the Curry & the Crew show with Adam Curry from 6.00 to 9.00. For the show, Veenstra presented a week-long radio show from army base Camp Smitty in Iraq and from a Las Vegas night club, among other places. When Adam Curry left in September 2004, Veenstra started working with successor Jeroen van Inkel. Veenstra also presented a new Friday night show, the Veenstravaganza! show. He received a young talent award from the Marconi Awards jury.|$|R
5000|$|The first Yoyo {{enterprise}} was {{a recording}} studio built inside Olympia's Capitol Theater by audio engineer Pat Maley. By 1992, Maley had formed the Yoyo record label and released the compilation Throw (reissued on CD in 2001) which included tracks by area musicians. Maley eventually decided to initiate an independent musical event, inspired by Olympia's earlier International Pop Underground Convention (IPU), a highly regarded 1991 festival that has been deemed [...] "a watershed moment in indie rock".A musician himself, Maley organized the festival with help from drummer Kent Oiwa, graphic designer Pat Castaldo, and local disc jockey Michelle Noel. The guiding principle was the DIY ethic central to punk rock. In a press release for the festival, Maley declared: “Long ago, punk rock stopped being simply a noun that was young, loud, and proud. Now it’s also a descriptive term that tries to explain {{the difference between the}} buy in/sell out culture that wakes us <b>up</b> <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> for work, <b>and</b> the culture so many of us make every day with our own hands”.|$|R
6000|$|... "O yes!" [...] {{and each}} one took from under his cloak a pan of ashes, and {{sprinkled}} the boards, and walked right over. But before they reached the other edge, the dwarf pushed the chair, which was on rollers, {{up against the wall}} behind him, which opened; and instantly the Princess, Ting-a-ling, and the dwarf disappeared, and the wall closed up. Without saying a word, the magicians each drew from beneath his cloak a pickaxe, and they cut a hole in the wall in a few minutes. There was a large room on the other side, but it was entirely empty. So they sat down, and got out their magical calculators, and soon discovered that the Princess was in the lowest part of the castle; but the magical calculators being a little out of order, they could not show exactly her place of confinement. Then the five hurried down-stairs, where they found the slaves still asleep; but one poor little boy, whose business it was to get <b>up</b> early <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> split kindling wood, having had none of the feast, was not very sleepy, and woke up when he heard footsteps near him. The magicians asked him if he could show them to the lowest part of the castle. [...] "All right," [...] said he; [...] "this way;" [...] and he led them to where there was a great black hole, with a windlass over it. [...] "Get in the bucket," [...] said he, [...] "and I will lower you down." ...|$|R
5000|$|Interviewed a {{year after}} his casting was announced, Pow commented on his time on Holby City so far: [...] "I don't think I've ever enjoyed a job as much. It is a {{pleasure}} to get <b>up</b> <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> spend my days working at Holby. From the producers, writers and production staff through to the crew and the cast, everyone is lovely {{to work with and}} the atmosphere is always positive and good fun. What more could I wish for? I'm getting paid to do something I love ... Linden is a very complex character to play and getting your teeth into him has been a dream, any actor would relish the opportunity, I just feel lucky and privileged that it was me that was given the chance".|$|E

In 2001 {{he spoke of the}} Japanese desire to [...] "supply the Japanese consumer at a reasonable price with high-quality sashimi." [...] Japan's Overseas Fishery Cooperation Foundation sent two operatives to Port Lincoln to help establish the industry. Since that time the industry has captured young fish in the wild and transferred them to pens in Boston Bay and Spencer Gulf where they are fattened up for market. They are then harvested, chilled and exported to Japan by plane. The same year, Jefferiess expressed concern that his town of Port Lincoln would suffer if the industry collapsed, saying [...] "I find this scary. I wake <b>up</b> <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> think `How do you sustain this?"' ...|$|E
5000|$|Krenwinkel, still incarcerated, {{is now at}} the California Institution for Women in Chino, California. In an {{interview}} conducted by Diane Sawyer in 1994, Krenwinkel stated: [...] "I wake up every day knowing that I'm a destroyer of the most precious thing, which is life; and I do that because that's what I deserve, is to wake <b>up</b> <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> know that." [...] During that same interview, Patricia expressed the most remorse for what she did to Folger, telling Diane Sawyer, [...] "That was just a young woman that I killed, who had parents. She was supposed to live a life and her parents were never supposed to see her dead." [...] In that same interview, she said that Manson was [...] "absolutely lying" [...] about not ordering the murders. She said, [...] "There wasn't one thing done--that was even allowed to be done--without his express permission." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{first week}} or two went on happily enough in getting our little new pet of a house into trimness and good order; for {{as it had been}} long for sale, of course there was any amount of little repairs that had been left to amuse the leisure hours of the purchaser. Here a {{doorstep}} had given way, and needed replacing; there a shutter hung loose, and wanted a hinge; abundance of glass needed setting; and as to painting and papering, there was no end to that. Then my wife wanted a door cut here, to make our bedroom more convenient, and a china closet knocked up there, where no china closet before had been. We even ventured on throwing out a bay-window from our sitting-room, because we had luckily lighted on a workman who was so cheap that it was an actual saving of money to employ him. And to be sure our darling little cottage did lift up its head wonderfully for all this garnishing and furbishing. I got <b>up</b> early <b>every</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>and</b> nailed <b>up</b> the rosebushes, and my wife got up and watered geraniums, and both flattered ourselves and each other on our early hours and thrifty habits. But soon, like Adam and Eve in Paradise, we found our little domain to ask more hands than ours to get it into shape. So says I to my wife, [...] "I will bring out a gardener when I come next time, and he shall lay the garden out, and get it into order; and after that I can easily keep it by the work of my leisure hours." ...|$|R

Don said that weak lungs ran in the family, as their father, Ike, had died of black lung disease. He admitted that he had lived [...] "a very difficult life" [...] with his brother and that he and Phil had become estranged once again in later years, something which was mainly attributed to [...] "their vastly different views on politics and life," [...] with the music being the one thing they shared closely, saying, [...] "it's almost like we could read each other's minds when we sang." [...] However, Don also stated he had not gotten over Phil's death, saying, [...] "I always thought about him every day, even when we were not speaking to each other. It still just shocks me that he's gone." [...] Don added that he always firmly believed he would die before his brother, because he was older than Phil. In a 2016 interview Don said he was still coping with the loss of Phil and that he had kept some of his brother's ashes in his home. He added that he would pick <b>up</b> the ashes <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> say [...] "good morning," [...] while admitting that it was a peculiar ritual.|$|R
5000|$|Once at the El Monte complex, the Thai {{nationals}} {{were forced}} to sew clothing seventeen to twenty two hours a day. [...] They were not allowed any {{contact with the outside}} world and their letters home were censored, opened and read to insure no news of their captivity would reach home. [...] They were not allowed breaks even when sick [...] or any social interactions with each other. [...] They were under 24/7 surveillance by armed guards. [...] Some were held against their will for as long as seven years. The workers were virtually not paid as they had to work off their debt to their traffickers/employers. [...] In essence, they became indentured servants. However, they {{were forced to}} buy food and personal supplies such as toothpaste and shampoo at inflated prices from the employers residing at the complex who operated sundries in the garages. [...] Having no money to make their purchases, these amounts for the rent and personal items would just be tacked on to their debts. Therefore, their debt just kept growing with no end in sight. [...] They sewed clothing for many well-known brands such as Anchor Blue, B.U.M., High Sierra, CLEO and Tomato Inc. [...] The workers were forced to wake <b>up</b> at six <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> worked under the watchful eyes of their Thai national employers who included Suni Manasurangkun and her four sons and two daughters-in-law.|$|R
