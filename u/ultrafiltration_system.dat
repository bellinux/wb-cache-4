40|$|The aim in {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether implementing an on farm <b>ultrafiltration</b> <b>system</b> was profitable. Ultrafiltration was researched to reduce the amount of milk hauled from producer to processor. An <b>ultrafiltration</b> <b>system</b> involved milk that flowed through a semi-permeable membrane. Through this process water and small amounts of calcium and ash were pressured through the semi-permeable membrane. This permeate would then be able to feed heifers. The protein, fat, solids nonfat, and small amounts of calcium and ash were retained by the membrane. Through the process of ultrafiltration, raw milk was concentrated to three times its original concentration. With the use of ultrafiltration, the dairyman would need to one load of ultrafiltration milk instead of three loads of raw milk. The reduction in the cost of milk hauled and the feed presented to the heifers were the advantages in ultrafiltration. With the saved money on hauling and feeding of heifers, the initial costs of the system and the annual maintenance cost of the system exceed the benefits if implemented on De Groot Dairies. For the on farm <b>ultrafiltration</b> <b>system</b> to break even in ten years, the producer would need to be paid an additional $ 1. 05 /cwt of retentate. This price included the reduced hauling cost and the money saved on the heifer ration. The difference in net present values on the costs of the system and the savings in permeate and hauling were -$ 5, 072, 770. 24 over a 20 year period. Due to 87 % water in milk, ultrafiltration needed to be examined. A dairyman should always look at his or her option to save money, wherever possible.

A diverse experimental study was carried out to synthesize novel hollow fiber membranes based on polyphenylsulfone (PPSu) and polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) fibers for surface water treatment. A manual hollow fiber spinning machine incorporated with an inexpensive spinneret was designed to fabricate hollow fibers from dope compositions of 20 wt% PVDF in DMAc and 20 wt% PPSu in NMP by phase inversion technique. Isothermal ternary phase diagrams of PVDF or PPSu/solvent/non-solvent systems were established using three different solvents such as N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), 1 -methyl- 2 -pyrrolidinone (NMP) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) with water being the non-solvent. The indigenous fibers had an approximate outer diameter of 1. 5 mm and the wall thickness of 0. 25 mm and were housed in inexpensive PVC and UPVC tubes using epoxy resin and nylon end connectors.

40|$|An {{artificial}} kidney process based on ultrafiltration (called hemodiafiltration) more effectively removes blood toxins, {{particularly those of}} higher molecular weight, than conventional dialysis. In hemodiafiltration, replacement liquid must be added directly to the patient 2 ̆ 7 s blood to replace liquid filtered out of the blood in the ultrafiltration cartridge. This replacement liquid {{is made up of}} 2 ̆ 7 2 ̆ 2 water for injection 2 ̆ 2 (WFI) and other components such as salts and glucose. WFI is produced either by distillation or reverse osmosis and has a cost of 1. 00 per liter. A patient with kidney problems would require three hemodiafiltration treatments per week, each requiring 70 - 80 liters of WFI. Since the target cost of a treatment is less than 100, the cost of WFI alone, 70 - 80, makes the process not economically feasible. In order for the hemodiafiltration process to be widely used and to be affordable in third world countries, a system that produces WFI at a low cost is needed. A process to replace distillation or reverse osmosis must be capable of removing pyrogens. Some information is available in the literature indicating that ultrafiltration membranes can remove endotoxins, the main constituent of pyrogens; however, no studies have been done to establish the type of ultrafiltration membrane that gives optimal removal of endotoxins. Ultrafiltration is known to be a much less expensive process than distillation or reverse osmosis. It is thoroughly estimated that WFI produced by <b>Ultrafiltration</b> <b>System</b> would cost only 25 cents per liter. The purpose of this experimental work is to determine the type of ultrafiltration membrane that effectively removes endotoxins with an efficient flow rate. Regenerated cellulose and polyethersulfone membranes with various molecular-weight-cut-offs were evaluated to determine the endotoxin rejection and flux rates of the membranes. A stirred cell experiment was performed as a short-term test, using disc membranes with a diameter of 76 mm and three types of feed solutions. The Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) Gel Clot test was performed to measure the concentration of pyrogen in the filtrates. The best candidate from the stirred cell experiment was tested in a Hollow Fiber Cartridge <b>Ultrafiltration</b> <b>System</b> over a longer time period. The results showed that a polyethersulfone membrane with a molecular-weight-cut-off (MWCO) of 10, 000 rejected endotoxin to below the US Pharmacopeia (USP) limit of endotoxin content, 0. 25 EU/ml, with the best flux rate.

Based on this success, the focus more recently moved to other coating materials, such as paper coatings, latex and flexographic ink. Similar to electro-deposition paint, the concept is to recover the diluted coating materials with ultrafiltration to obtain a solid-free permeate stream, which can be either recycled or easily treated, and a retentate stream, which contains the coating materials preferably at concentrations suitable for recycling or disposal.

Because the net charges of enantiomer and CLG are pH-dependent, it is foreseen that pH {{will be an important}} factor in the design of a cascaded separation process that yields enantiopure products. Experiments at pH 7, 9, and 11 showed that the complexation can be described by multicomponent Langmuir isotherms. The CLG enantioselectivity for d-Phe increases with decreasing pH, being 1. 4, 1. 7, and 1. 9 for pH 11, 9, and 7, respectively. Accordingly, the saturation concentration and the affinity constants decrease with decreasing pH, finally resulting in no complexation at pH 6. To design an economically attractive separation process, the regeneration of d-Phe-saturated micelles leaving the multistage system is inevitable. Regeneration, i. e., recovery of enantioselective micelles for reuse, is possible at pH = 4. To keep salt production to a minimum, the shift in pH between the separation and regeneration processes must be minimized. Therefore, a separation process at pH 7 seems most attractive...|$|R

A cascaded system is needed to complete the separation, as a single stage is insufficient to obtain > 99 ␘ptically pure products. It is shown that the complexation and decomplexation processes are not instantaneous; hence, elucidation of the complexation kinetics {{is essential to the}} design of a multistage system. Linear driving force (LDF) models describe both the complexation and decomplexation rates of enantiomers. It can be concluded that the complexation rates of D- and L-Phe, (32 ± 11) x 10 - 5 s- 1 and (28 ± 14) x 10 - 5 s- 1, respectively, are not limited by enantiomer diffusion in the hydrophilic shell of the micelles. Consequently, the formation and rearrangement of the chelate complexes must be rate-limiting. In addition, decomplexation of both enantiomers is even slower, on the order of 10 - 6 s- 1. Fortunately, ultrafiltration experiments indicate that a rapid exchange rate of bound L-Phe by unbound D-Phe improves the decomplexation of L-Phe to (360 ± 250) x 10 - 5 mM- 1 s- 1.

30|$|Excellent ethanol yield at high titer without {{detoxification}} in fermentation {{were achieved}} from both pretreatments, indicating the LSs produced {{from these two}} pretreatments are representative of biorefinery LSs. Separation of LS from the SPORL spent liquors were performed using an in-house pilot plant <b>ultrafiltration</b> (UF) <b>system</b> equipped with single-tube modules each with a separate permeate outlet [32]. The liquors were first centrifuged at 4000  rpm for 20  min to remove solids. Two membranes ES 404 and FP 200 (Xylem PCI Membranes, Kostrzyn, Poland) that had cut-off molecular weight of 4 and 200  kDa, respectively, were used to remove low molecular weight impurities such as sugars and sugar degradation products (furans and organic acids, etc.) and very fine particular matters.|$|R
