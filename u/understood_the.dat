5|$|All of the game's {{music was}} {{composed}} by Shogo Sakai. Itoi saw Sakai as competing with Mother 2 composer Keiichi Suzuki for his fans. Itoi {{had to choose}} a composer from the development team who <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> series and could work full-time on the project, including other development duties. Thus, he could not choose Suzuki, who was outside the project, or Hirokazu Tanaka, who had become the president of Creatures. Sakai also <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> game's story intimately and named the Magypsies after musical terms. He worked to make the music feel similar to previous entries in the series.|$|E
5|$|Dodd also <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> {{deep-seated}} {{rivalry with}} the University of Georgia. His teams won 8 {{games in a}} row over the Bulldogs from 1946–1954 outscoring the Bulldogs 176–39 during the winning streak. This 8–game winning streak against Georgia remains the longest winning streak by either team in the series. Dodd would finish his career with a 12–9 record against the Bulldogs.|$|E

50|$|Engineering is {{traditionally}} decompositional. To <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> whole, it is first broken into its parts. One then masters the parts {{and puts them}} back together, becoming {{the master of the}} whole.Industrial and systems engineering's (ISE) approach is the opposite; any one part cannot be <b>understood</b> without <b>the</b> context of the whole. Changes in one part affect the whole, and the role of a part is a projection into the whole. In traditional engineering, people <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> parts first, then they can <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> whole. In ISE, they <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> whole first, and then they can <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> role of each part.|$|R

5|$|The proper METHOD for {{studying}} poetry and good letters is {{the method of}} contemporary biologists, that is careful first-hand examination of the matter, and continual COMPARISON of one 'slide' or specimen with another.

5|$|According to setup {{coordinator}} Douglas Cook, the rehearsals {{enabled them}} to reduce the setup time to under five minutes. Cook, who had worked on previous halftime shows, <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> details and guided the team. Drawings of the performances depicted what was expected for each setup, with the volunteers assembling the stage in segments and moving them to the field with carts. Madonna's entrance had to be rehearsed several times for coordination. Although Cook learned during the game that the New England Patriots were scheduled to exit on the route used by volunteers carrying the stage equipment, he resolved the issue by talking with the team.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of Wisconsin Heights, a {{messenger}} from Black Hawk had shouted to the militiamen that the starving British Band {{was going back}} across the Mississippi and would fight no more. No one in the American camp <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> message, however, since their Ho-Chunk guides were not present to interpret. Black Hawk may have believed that the Americans had gotten the message, {{and that they had}} not pursued him after the Battle of Wisconsin Heights. He apparently expected that the Americans were going to let his band recross the Mississippi unmolested.|$|E
5|$|Although its {{evolutionary}} history—what the forerunner to {{the species}} {{was and how}} the close relatives branched off—is not well <b>understood,</b> <b>the</b> painted turtle is common in the fossil record. The oldest samples, found in Nebraska, date to about 15million years ago. Fossils from 15million to about 5million years ago are restricted to the Nebraska-Kansas area, but more recent fossils are gradually more widely distributed. Fossils newer than 300,000years old are found in almost all the United States and southern Canada.|$|E
5|$|At 23:00, the San Francisco {{aircraft}} spotted Jojima's force off Guadalcanal {{and reported}} it to Scott. Scott, believing that more Japanese ships were likely {{still on the}} way, continued his course towards {{the west side of}} Savo Island. At 23:33, Scott ordered his column to turn towards the southwest to a heading of 230°. All of Scott's ships <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> order as a column movement except Scott's own ship, San Francisco. As the three lead U.S. destroyers executed the column movement, San Francisco turned simultaneously. Boise—following immediately behind—followed San Francisco, thereby throwing the three van destroyers out of formation.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the twentieth}} century, the {{mechanics}} of how dew condenses were much better <b>understood.</b> <b>The</b> key insight was that low-mass collectors which rapidly lose heat by radiation perform best. A number of researchers worked on this method. In the early 1960s, dew condensers made from sheets of polyethylene supported on a simple frame resembling a ridge tent were used in Israel to irrigate plants. Saplings supplied with dew and very slight rainfall from these collectors survived much better than the control group planted without such aids– they all dried up over the summer. In 1986 in New Mexico condensers made of a special foil produced sufficient water to supply young saplings.|$|E
5|$|Caroline Island is {{believed}} to have originated from a volcanic hotspot which eroded and then became home to a coral reef which grew above the ocean surface. Although these geological processes are poorly <b>understood,</b> <b>the</b> orientation of the Line Islands (roughly north-south) suggests that they were formed more than 40 million years ago, before the Pacific Plate changed its direction of travel. The same hotspot more recently gave rise to the Tuamotu Archipelago.|$|E

5|$|Coprinopsis variegata can attack soil bacteria, such as {{species of}} Pseudomonas and Agrobacterium, {{and use them}} as {{nutrient}} sources. The fungus achieves this by growing specialized hyphae {{in the direction of}} the bacteria, sensing them with some chemoattractive mechanism not yet fully <b>understood.</b> <b>The</b> fungus then secretes compounds to digest the bacteria while growing assimilative hyphae to absorb the nutrients. The process is relatively rapid, and bacterial colonies can be assimilated in less than 24 hours.|$|E
5|$|Early Mormons <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> Book of Mormon to be a {{religious}} {{history of the}} indigenous peoples of the Americas. Smith's followers {{view it as a}} companion to the Bible and an additional witness of Christ, akin to a large apocryphal work. Modern historian Fawn Brodie has called the Book of Mormon a response to pressing cultural and environmental issues of Smith's times, saying that Smith composed the Book of Mormon drawing from scraps of information available to him. Dan Vogel, another historian, says that the work is autobiographical in nature.|$|E
