50|$|One {{improvement}} on the Bucherer-Bergs reaction {{has been the}} use of <b>ultrasonication.</b> More recently, many organic reactions have been accelerated by ultrasonic irradiation. In the past, the Bucherer-Bergs reaction has had problems with polymerization, long reaction time, and difficult work-up. 5,5-disubstituted hydantoins can be prepared using the Bucherer-Bergs reaction under <b>ultrasonication.</b> Compared with reports in the literature, this makes so the reaction {{can be carried out}} at a lower temperature, have a shorter reaction time, a higher yield, and a more simple work-up.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ultrasonication</b> offers great {{potential}} in the processing of liquids and slurries, by improving the mixing and chemical reactions in various applications and industries. <b>Ultrasonication</b> generates alternating low-pressure and high-pressure waves in liquids, leading to the formation and violent collapse of small vacuum bubbles. This phenomenon is termed cavitation and causes high speed impinging liquid jets and strong hydrodynamic shear-forces. These effects are used for the deagglomeration and milling of micrometre and nanometre-size materials {{as well as for}} the disintegration of cells or the mixing of reactants. In this aspect, <b>ultrasonication</b> is an alternative to high-speed mixers and agitator bead mills. Ultrasonic foils under the moving wire in a paper machine will use the shock waves from the imploding bubbles to distribute the cellulose fibres more uniformly in the produced paper web, which will make a stronger paper with more even surfaces. Furthermore, chemical reactions benefit from the free radicals created by the cavitation as well as from the energy input and the material transfer through boundary layers. For many processes, this sonochemical (see sonochemistry) effect leads to a substantial reduction in the reaction time, like in the transesterification of oil into biodiesel.|$|E

50|$|The name {{originates}} {{from the}} fact it was originally isolated in Taiwanese hinoki in 1936. It is actually almost absent in Japanese hinoki while it is contained in high concentration (about 0.04% of heartwood mass) in Juniperus cedrus, Hiba cedar wood (Thujopsis dolabrata) and Western red cedar (Thuja plicata).

50|$|The Simmons-Smith reagent is used {{to prepare}} cyclopropanes from olefin using {{methylene}} iodide as the methylene source. The reaction is effected with zinc. The key zinc-intermediate formed is a carbenoid (iodomethyl)zinc iodide which reacts with alkenes to afford the cyclopropanated product. The rate of forming the active zinc species is increased via <b>ultrasonication</b> since the initial reaction occurs at {{the surface of the}} metal.|$|E
50|$|Solvent {{evaporation}} {{is another}} effective method to prepare nanocapsules. In this process, single or double emulsions are formed from solvents {{and are used}} to formulate a nanoparticle suspension. High speed homogenization or <b>ultrasonication</b> is used to form small particle size in the nanoparticle suspension.

50|$|To {{reduce the}} {{destructive}} impacts of PFCs on the environment, people have developed many technologies to remove PFCs from aqueous solutions, including adsorption, ion exchange, membrane separation, photochemical oxidation, <b>ultrasonication,</b> bioremediation, plasma oxidation, and other techniques. These technologies require harsh treatment conditions, cause high energy consumption, and cannot {{be applied in}} large scale. Electrochemical oxidation (EO) is a promising technique to remove PFCs from contaminated wastewater. It has many advantages, such as relatively lower energy consumption, milder conditions, and higher removal efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Once formed, nuclei collide to {{coalesce}} or agglomerate where {{temperature and}} species dictate the mechanism. Cooling changes {{the effect of}} collision from coalescence to agglomeration. LF-FSP's rapid drop in temperature as the particles exit the flame prevents the formation of aggregate. Definition of aggregate and its detrimental effect is discussed in advantages section. Collisions that take place after the temperature drop result in agglomerates, in which particles bond weakly by Van der Waals forces, {{and they can be}} separated easily with <b>ultrasonication</b> or ball-milling.|$|E

50|$|Generally speaking, an {{aqueous solvent}} dissolves less gas at higher temperature, {{and vice versa}} for organic {{solvents}} (provided the solute and solvent do not react). Consequently, heating an aqueous solution can expel dissolved gas, whereas cooling an organic solution has the same effect. <b>Ultrasonication</b> and stirring during thermal regulation are also effective. This method needs no special apparatus and is easy to conduct. In some cases, however, the solvent and the solute decompose, react with each other, or evaporate at high temperature, {{and the rate of}} removal is less reproducible.|$|E
50|$|In 1942, Gaffron and Rubin may be {{credited}} with conducting an experiment that sparked H2 production research in green algae using Scenedesmus obliquus. Algae produce H2 gas under anaerobic conditions by providing hydrogenases with hydrogen ions derived from splitting of water molecules via photosynthesis. However, enzyme activity is transient due to inhibition from O2 production via photosynthesis, {{a problem that}} continues to plague H2 production.S. obliquus is traditionally known to utilize a nickel-iron hydrogenase, but usage of other iron hydrogenases in H2 production is also reported. Hydrogenase enzyme activity of Scenedesmus sp. {{is reported to be}} lower than that of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. H2 production independent of Photosystem II in Scenedesmus has also been performed using redox equivalents of fermentative metabolism under dark anaerobic incubation. Research findings suggest that a sulfur-deprived environment triggers an imbalance in the photosynthesis and respiration relationship, resulting in net consumption of O2, causing anaerobiosis, and switching to hydrogen production. <b>Ultrasonication</b> pretreatment has been effective in increasing fermentative bioenergy production from Scenedesmus oliquus YSW15. Bio-hydrogen production research using Scenedesmus is actively spurred by its applications to wastewater treatment. (See subsequent section on waste management by Scenedesmus).|$|E
50|$|While {{exceptions}} exist, most flame-made {{particles are}} nano-sized (< 100 nm) and highly crystalline. Also, neither phase separation within each particle nor composition variance among particles is observed, {{as the entire}} process is so rapid that atomically mixed particles are formed. Their properties stem from the flame temperature (up to 2000 °C) and high cooling rates (>500 °C/s). Low residence times in the flame (the amount of time metal ions spend in the flame zone) and rapid cooling lead to metastable phase formation and more importantly unaggregated particles, as {{they do not have}} the energy to coalesce and neck. The purity of the initial reactants largely drives the final powder's purity. Some carbonate species may be present on as-produced powders; however, processing techniques can minimize these impurities in final products. First, the powder is dispersed in a solvent via <b>ultrasonication</b> and left to sit for 8 to 12 hours, which leads to some small fraction of larger particles, mostly carbonates, settling at the bottom. The suspension is separated from the sediment and is dried in an oven before being ground into a powder. Thus, LF-FSP provides a robust, versatile route to single and mixed-metal oxide powders in the 15-100 nm size range with varying phase and morphology from relatively low-cost organic precursors.|$|E
50|$|Due to the miniscular {{magnitude}} of output {{generated by a}} single nanoactuator the necessity to use arrays of such actuators to accomplish a higher task comes into picture. Conventional methods like chemical vapor deposition (CVD) allow the exact placement of nanotubes by growing them directly on the substrate. However, such methods are unable to produce very high qualities of MWNT. Moreover, CVD is a high temperature process that would severely limit the compatibility with other materials in the system. A Si substrate is coated with electron beam resist and soaked in acetone to leave only a thin polymer layer. The substrate is selectively exposed to an low energy electron beam of an SEM that activates the adhesive properties of the polymer later. This forms {{the basis for the}} targeting method. The alignment method exploits the surface velocity obtained by a fluid as it flows off a spinning substrate. MWNTs are suspended in orthodicholrobenzene (ODCB) by <b>ultrasonication</b> in an aquasonic bath that separates most MWNT bundles into individual MWNTs. Drops of this suspension are then pipetted one by one onto the center of a silicon substrate mounted on a spin coater rotating at 3000 rpm. Each subsequent drop of the suspension is pipetted only after the previous drop has completely dried to ensure larger density and better alignment of the MWNTs (90% of the MWNTs over 1 µm long lie within 1°). Standard electron beam lithography is used to pattern the remaining components of the nanoactuators.|$|E

For comparison, an extra sample was prepared by directly depositing a droplet of the GNP sol onto an ITO glass substrate, and GNPs remained {{on the surface of}} the substrate after evaporating the sol under ambient conditions. FESEM observations (not shown in figure) were carried out at the same positions on the substrates both before and after applying 5 -min <b>ultrasonication</b> on the GNP thin films and the reference one. We found that the GNPs on thin films fabricated by electrophoretic deposition method were resistant to the <b>ultrasonication</b> process.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the effect of <b>ultrasonication</b> on bismuth telluride nanocrystals prepared by solvothermal method. In this study, a low dimensional nanocrystal of bismuth telluride (Bi 2 Te 3) was synthesized by a solvothermal process in an autoclave at 180 C and 200 psi. During the solvothermal reaction, organic surfactants effectively prevented unwanted aggregation of nanocrystals in a selected solvent while controlling the shape of the nanocrystal. The atomic ratio of bismuth and tellurium was determined by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The cavitational energy created by the ultrasonic probe was varied by the <b>ultrasonication</b> process time, while power amplitude remained constant. The nanocrystal size and its size distribution were measured by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and a dynamic light scattering system. When the <b>ultrasonication</b> time increased, the average size of bismuth telluride nanocrystal gradually increased due to the direct collision of nanocrystals.

40|$|Nanocrystalline {{cellulose}} (NCC) {{has been}} {{classified as a}} new category of cellulose matter and {{has been used in}} various technical extents such as in medicinal and biotechnological areas. The nanocrystalline cellulose is typically constructed by the reaction of condensed and toxic acid on primal cellulose samples at different temperatures to ensure ultrasound breakdown. However, the current method for the formation of nanocrystalline cellulose is neither environmentally friendly nor energy efficient. Therefore, this study made use of ionic liquids, 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride as an alternative to produce nanocrystalline cellulose. Comprehensive investigations on different parameters, such as <b>ultrasonication</b> time, <b>ultrasonication</b> vibration, temperature, dissolution time and microcrystalline cellulose to ionic liquids ratio were conducted in order to control the specific architecture of nanocrystalline cellulose. This study utilizes 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride followed by <b>ultrasonication</b> to produce nanocrystalline cellulose with a rod-like structure from microcrystalline cellulose. The crystalline structure was noted as Cellulose I, which is similar to the starting materials. Increasing the vibration amplitude of the <b>ultrasonication</b> increases the yield, crystallinity index, thermal properties and particle size of the NCC. Meanwhile, decreasing the <b>ultrasonication</b> time improved the crystallinity, thermal properties and particle size of the NCC. Increasing the temperature, dissolution time and microcrystalline cellulose to ionic liquids ratio enhance the crystallinity, yield, thermal properties, and also the diameter size of the NCC. Optimized conditions were recorded to be as followings: <b>ultrasonication</b> time (5 minutes), <b>ultrasonication</b> vibration (70 %), temperature (100 °C), dissolution time (30 minutes) and microcrystalline cellulose to ionic liquids ratio (1 : 10).
