5|$|Before Henry's father (Henry VII) {{ascended the}} throne, England had been beset by civil warfare over rival {{claims to the}} English crown. Henry wanted to avoid a similar <b>uncertainty</b> <b>over</b> the succession. Catherine of Aragon's only {{surviving}} child was Princess Mary.|$|E
5|$|The South Hillingdon {{branch of}} the St. John Ambulance service was based at RAF Uxbridge until the closure in 2010 led to a period of <b>uncertainty</b> <b>over</b> its relocation.

40|$|Britain {{occupied}} Cyprus {{by virtue}} of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 4 June 1878, which ceded the occupation and administration (but not sovereignty) to Britain. The Lord Beaconsfield Government planned to convert Cyprus into a place of arms. The architects of this policy saw Cyprus as ideal for stationing troops, and sent there a 10, 000 strong army of occupation. They saw Famagusta Harbour as the perfect naval and commercial station in the eastern Mediterranean. But within months of the occupation, <b>uncertainties</b> developed <b>over</b> the military and naval value of Cyprus. The decision to build the Troodos Hill Station stood {{in stark contrast to the}} <b>uncertainties</b> <b>over</b> the military and naval value of the island, and the <b>uncertainties</b> <b>over</b> whether to act as if Cyprus was a British or Ottoman territory...|$|R

5|$|Due to <b>uncertainty</b> <b>over</b> {{whether the}} object would be {{classified}} as a planet or a minor planet, because different nomenclature procedures apply to these different classes of objects, the decision on what to name the object {{had to wait until}} after the August 24, 2006, IAU ruling. As a result, for a time the object became known to the wider public as Xena.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the war, Australia's economy had been quite small and {{dependent}} largely upon agriculture and the resources industries for export earnings, while most manufactured products were imported from overseas. Almost immediately <b>uncertainty</b> <b>over</b> the continuation of foreign trade led to a rise in unemployment, indeed it was estimated that after only a couple of days of Britain having declared war, that up to 15,000 men had been retrenched in New South Wales alone due to concerns about the continued availability of foreign markets for Australian produce.|$|E

5|$|He {{suffered}} a broken nose following Daniel Sturridge elbowing {{him in the}} face in the following game, and subsequently missed the FA Cup semi-final. However, he recovered to play four further Premier League matches. Portsmouth were relegated in 20th position {{at the end of the}} season, having been deducted nine points for entering into administration. Despite <b>uncertainty</b> <b>over</b> whether the club would be able to continue as a business, Smith remained at the club. He started their first match of the 2010–11 season on 7 August 2010, a match in which Portsmouth were only able to name four of their permitted seven substitutes.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006 it was {{announced}} that the festival was in financial crisis and there was <b>uncertainty</b> <b>over</b> whether the 2007 event would take place. The festival planning went ahead with support and donations from a number of Bristol businesses. In June 2007 it {{was announced}} that alcohol {{would not be allowed to}} be taken on site, but would be available to purchase from official bars within the arena. Also, that everyone attending the festival would be searched on the way in. This announcement caused much controversy.|$|E
5|$|The F-FDTL has {{suffered}} from serious morale and disciplinary problems since its establishment. These problems have been driven by <b>uncertainty</b> <b>over</b> the F-FDTL's role, poor conditions of service due to limited resources, tensions arising from FALINTIL's transition from a guerrilla organisation to a regular military and political and regional rivalries. The F-FDTL's morale and disciplinary problems have resulted in large numbers of soldiers being disciplined or dismissed. The East Timorese Government was aware of these problems before the 2006 crisis but did not rectify the factors that were contributing to low morale.|$|E
50|$|Initial {{expectations}} were for construction {{to begin in}} 2012 and the facility be operational by 2014.

5|$|The entire Homicide cast {{returned}} {{for the second}} season. The <b>uncertainty</b> <b>over</b> Homicides future was stressful for the cast and crew, and the logistics of scheduling the filming around the actors' schedules was difficult. Daniel Baldwin publicly criticized NBC Entertainment president Warren Littlefield over the matter, and it was initially reported Ned Beatty would not return at all. The second season {{was the last to}} include original cast member Jon Polito, who was reportedly dismissed because NBC officials were unhappy with his physical appearance. Polito was publicly critical of the show after his dismissal.|$|E
5|$|The {{months before}} the 1997 season opener {{featured}} <b>uncertainty</b> <b>over</b> the quarterback position. Junior Scott Dreisbach had started 11 games for the 1996 team, but fifth-year senior Brian Griese had relieved Driesbach in the Ohio State game after Driesbach was injured and helped the team recover from a 9–0 deficit. Dreisbach and Griese also faced competition from sophomore and future Super Bowl MVP, Tom Brady. Shortly before the season opener, head coach Lloyd Carr announced his selection of Griese as the starting quarterback.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason behind}} these discords were {{laid on the}} {{imperfect}} execution of the reorganisation of the College in 1568 and the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>over</b> issue of granting arms to the new and emerging gentry of the era. An enquiry into {{the state of the}} College lasted for one year, finally reporting to William Cecil, Baron Burghley in 1596; as a consequence, many important measures of reform for the College were made in the reign of James I. Eventually, these animosities among the heralds in the College ended only after the expulsion of one and the death of another.|$|E
40|$|As sea-level rises, the {{frequency}} of coastal marine flooding events is changing. For accurate assessments, several other factors must be considered as well, such as the variability of sea-level rise and storm surge patterns. Here, a global sensitivity analysis is used to provide quantitative insight into {{the relative importance of}} contributing <b>uncertainties</b> <b>over</b> the coming decades. The method is applied on an urban low-lying coastal site located in the north-western Mediterranean, where the yearly probability of damaging flooding could grow drastically after 2050 if sea-level rise follows IPCC projections. Storm surge propagation processes, then sea-level variability, and, later, global sea-level rise scenarios become successively important source of <b>uncertainties</b> <b>over</b> the 21 st century. This defines research priorities that depend on the target period of interest. On the long term, scenarios RCP 6. 0 and 8. 0 challenge local capacities of adaptation for the considered site...|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 2006–07 season, Arsenal {{transferred}} Fabrice Muamba to Birmingham City {{and released}} Mart Poom, who subsequently joined Watford on a free transfer. Jérémie Aliadière moved to Middlesbrough in a £2million deal while club captain and record goalscorer Thierry Henry left to join Barcelona for a reported fee of £16million. Henry commented that his decision to leave Arsenal was because of the departure of chairman David Dein and the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>over</b> Wenger's future. Midfielder Fredrik Ljungberg and striker José Antonio Reyes departed the club in July 2007, moving to West Ham United and Atlético Madrid respectively. Other players, Arturo Lupoli, Ryan Garry and Joe O'Cearuill, left on free transfers. Defender Matthew Connolly, who joined Colchester United on loan for a six-month period, later signed for Queens Park Rangers.|$|E
5|$|Despite the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>over</b> the clan's origins, Samuel {{undoubtedly}} {{descended from}} a distinguished family, since an unnamed sister of Stephen I, who had in 1000 or 1001 been crowned the first King of Hungary, {{was given in}} marriage {{to a member of}} the Aba clan around 1009. However, historians still debate whether Samuel himself or Samuel's father married the royal princess. If Samuel was her husband, he must have been born before 990 and converted either from Judaism or paganismto Christianity when he married Stephen I's sister. His Christian credentials are further evidenced by Samuel's establishment of an abbey at Abasár which was recorded by Hungarian chronicles. According to Gyula Kristó and other historians, Samuel's conversion coincided with the creation of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Eger encompassing his domains.|$|E
5|$|Harry Bradshaw, {{appointed}} {{in the summer}} of 1899, was faced with several difficulties, not least falling attendances and limited funds to attract the best players. In his five years at Arsenal, he managed to steer the club away from bankruptcy by signing local talent such as Jimmy Ashcroft and Jimmy Jackson, and directed his team's promotion to the First Division in 1903–04. Phil Kelso replaced Bradshaw in the close season and succeeded in keeping the club afloat in the top division. He also steered Arsenal to the semi-final stage of the FA Cup in the 1905–06 and 1906–07 seasons. Kelso departed in February 1908, amid <b>uncertainty</b> <b>over</b> the club's finances, and was replaced by George Morrell, a fellow Scotsman. Morrell's time as manager coincided with Sir Henry Norris' takeover of Arsenal and the club's subsequent relocation to Highbury. Arsenal were relegated to the Second Division in 1913, though the move to North London brought about much larger attendances.|$|E
50|$|The UK {{received}} {{more from the}} EU for research than it contributed with universities getting just over 10% of their research income from the EU.

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the storm, more than 1,000 Electricity Supply Board (ESB) {{personnel}} were deployed to restore power. In some areas, locals worked together to provide others with fresh food after electricity was lost. Fire brigades were sent on patrol to quell any looting. In Galway, ESB repair crews worked through labor and supply shortages to restore power and telephone service despite recent strikes in the company. By September 23, officials in the city appealed to the Government for funding to deal with the aftermath of the hurricane. <b>Uncertainty</b> <b>over</b> whether some of the cost could be footed by landowners themselves resulted in disagreement over how much aid to request. Due to the severity of damage to the electrical grid, there were numerous requests made to the ESB to build underground power cables, especially in Galway.|$|E
5|$|It is {{probable}} {{that the idea of}} annulment (not divorce as commonly assumed) had suggested itself to Henry much earlier than this and was motivated by his desire for an heir to secure the Tudor claim to the crown. Before Henry's father Henry VII ascended the throne, England was beset by civil warfare over rival claims to the crown and Henry wanted to avoid a similar <b>uncertainty</b> <b>over</b> the succession. He and Catherine had no living sons: all Catherine's children except Mary died in infancy. Catherine of Aragon had first come to England to be bride to Henry's brother Arthur who died soon after their marriage. Since Spain and England still wanted an alliance, a dispensation was granted by Pope Julius II on the grounds that Catherine was still a virgin.|$|E
5|$|The {{consistent}} {{variation in}} the path of Claudette caused <b>uncertainty</b> <b>over</b> the strength and location of its final landfall. On July 13, two days prior to Claudette's eventual landfall, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch between Brownsville and Port O'Connor, Texas. By the next day, a hurricane warning existed from Baffin Bay to High Island, Texas, while a tropical storm warning extended from High Island to Intracoastal City, Louisiana. When it became apparent that Louisiana would not be affected significantly by the storm, the state's tropical storm warnings were canceled. In Texas, Galveston County officials recommended evacuations for western Galveston Island and Jamaica Beach, 24hours prior to Claudette's projected landfall. The Emergency Phone Notification System notified citizens in the evening to avoid evacuating during the night. Many citizens heeded the evacuation suggestion, some of whom remembered the flooding from Tropical Storm Frances five years before.|$|E

40|$|Researchers and {{practitioners}} have stressed that autonomous navigation in complex environments {{is an ongoing}} key challenge for robotic vehicles. Detection of drivable routes is often used {{as one of the}} important safety key operations to address some of the issues associated with autonomous navigation. While a number of conventional detection methods have been developed for such navigation; awareness of drivable routes by alleviating robot short-sightedness -without being trapped in uncertain dead-end problems, and to facilitating global navigational planning have received little attention. Finding a solution to these uncertainty problems is a challenge. In this paper, temporal probabilistic reasoning of the Emergent Situation Awareness (ESA) technology is proposed as a supportive strategy for autonomous navigation. The ability to reveal <b>uncertainties</b> <b>over</b> time is a drivable route awareness strategy of hidden paths embedded in the complex environments. Experimental evaluations of the ESA on real life and publicly available road frames outperform the classical statistical baseline methods in handling <b>uncertainties</b> <b>over</b> time. Our awareness results reveal to robotic vehicles that all ground planes are not traversable routes...|$|R
