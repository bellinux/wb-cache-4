40|$|The matched {{spectrum}} and correlation characteristics are both {{important to realize}} the multichannel ultrasonic sensors working together. The spectrum matching can make full use of the bandwidth of the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>ranging</b> system, and the good correlation characteristic can eliminate crosstalk among multichannel ultrasonic sensors triggering simultaneously. Linear frequency modulation (LFM) excitation sequences {{have been used as}} transmission signals for ultrasonic sensors. Due to the narrow bandwidth of the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>ranging</b> system, the number of available LFM excitation sequences is limited. The chaotic frequency modulation (CFM) excitation sequences, which can generate more available excitation signals, are proposed in this paper. The nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II is adopted to optimize both the {{spectrum and}} correlation characteristic of the CFM excitation sequences. After optimization, the CFM excitation sequences are spectrally matched to the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>ranging</b> system as well as have best correlation characteristic. Real experiments have been implemented using an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>ranging</b> system consisting of eight-channel SensComp 600 series electrostatic sensors excited with 2 ms CFM sequences.

40|$|In {{flammable}} or explosive environments, an {{ultrasonic sensor}} for distance measurement poses an important engineering safety challenge, because the driving circuit uses an intermediate frequency transformer as an impedance transformation element, {{in which the}} produced heat or spark is available for ignition.

The waterproof piezoelectric transducer with integrated transceiver is chosen as an energy transducing element. Then a novel transducer driving circuit is designed based on an impedance matching method considering safety spark parameters to replace an intermediate frequency transformer.
