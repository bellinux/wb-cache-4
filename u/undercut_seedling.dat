40|$|Changes in total, soluble, and {{insoluble}} {{nitrogen and}} chlorophyll concen-trations in Pinus radiata D. Don seedlings were monitored for 56 {{days after a}} single undercutting (root pruning). After undercutting there was a marked reduction in total soluble and insoluble shoot nitrogen concentration. Some of this mobilised nitrogen contributed towards lateral root growth while 15 % was lost, possibly from the damaged root as exudate. Twenty-one days after under-cutting, total seedling nitrogen content began to improve, coinciding with lateral root dry matter gains. By 56 days, <b>undercut</b> <b>seedling</b> nitrogen content approached that at Day 0, while control seedlings had acquired an additional 20. 6 mg nitrogen. Lateral root dry weights and nitrogen content of undercut seedlings were {{higher than those of}} control plants after 56 days. However, soluble nitrogen concentration in lateral roots of undercut seedlings was not significantly different from the controls, although total and insoluble nitrogen concentrations were significantly below control plant values. There {{was no significant difference in}} chlorophyll concentration of needles between control and undercut seedlings...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1979 The {{effects of}} winter plant {{moisture}} stress (P 145) on bare-root 2 + 0 Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Fra√±co) seedlings during nursery lifting and processing were studied. <b>Seedlings</b> were <b>undercut</b> at Ca. 4, 12, and 20 atm PMS during mid-February. Half of the <b>seedlings</b> <b>undercut</b> at 12 and 20 atm were not moistened after lifting (dry treated), the remaining seedlings received water sprayed directly on shoots and roots after lifting (wet treated). All seedlings were processed for field planting within {{six hours of}} lifting, and were cold stored for 55 days. Seedlings were planted in contrasting growth environments at two sites near Corvallis, Oregon, in early spring, 1977. Survival and growth were monitored during the first season after seedlings were planted under heavy and light irrigation, and with and without vegetative competition. The effects of winter PMS were highly associated with severity of the growing site. When moisture was not limiting, as under heavy and light irrigation schedules, treatment differences were small. Under non-irrigated field conditions treatment effects were significant. Wet treated seedlings produced significantly more height growth (9. 0 cm vs 8. 0 cm), and new foliage growth (5. 70 gin vs 4. 77 gin) than dry treated seedlings when grown free of vegetative competition. Survival without competition was excellent for all treatments ranging from 9...|$|R
