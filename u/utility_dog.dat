40|$|Extracts from Ginkgo biloba leaves confer their {{therapeutic}} effects {{through the}} synergistic actions of flavonoid and terpenoid components. We herein describe {{the development of}} an LC-MS/MS-based method for simultaneous determination of flavonoids (quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin) and terpenoids (bilobalide, ginkgolides A, B, C, and J) in acid-hydrolyzed plasma by circumventing cross-interference between the flavonoids and terpenoids identified. Notably, inclusion of ammonium formate (0. 2 mM) in the mobile phase generated beneficial LC-electrolyte effects, including increased ESI efficiency and capacity, with the result that the newly developed procedure exhibits the highest analytical performance reported to date for ginkgo-associated studies. The method yields high sensitivity, negligible matrix interference and cross-interference, wide linear dynamic ranges, high sample throughput, and quite small initial sample size.

40|$|Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are {{increasingly}} investigated for their clinical <b>utility</b> in <b>dogs.</b> Fetal bovine serum (FBS) {{is a common}} culture supplement used for canine MSC expansion. However, FBS content is variable, its clinical use carries risk of an immune response, and its cost is increasing due to global demand.

We hypothesized that canine adipose tissue (AT) and bone marrow (BM) MSC could be isolated and expanded equally in PL and FBS at conventionally-used concentrations with differentiation of these MSC unaffected by choice of supplement. Our objectives were to evaluate the use of canine PL in comparison with FBS at four stages: 1) isolation, 2) proliferation, 3) spontaneous differentiation, and 4) directed differentiation. 1) Medium with 10 % PL was unable to isolate MSC. 2) MSC, initially isolated in FBS-supplemented media, followed a dose-dependent response with no significant difference between PL and FBS cultures at up to 20 % (AT) or 30 % (BM) enrichment. Beyond these respective peaks, proliferation fell in PL cultures only, while a continued dose-dependent proliferation response was noted in FBS cultures. 3) Further investigation indicated PL expansion culture was inducing spontaneous adipogenesis in concentrations as low as 10 % and as early as 4 days in culture. 4) MSC isolated in FBS, but expanded in either FBS or PL, maintained ability to undergo directed adipogenesis and osteogenesis, but not chondrogenesis. Canine PL did not support establishment of MSC colonies from AT and BM, nor expansion of MSC, which appear to undergo spontaneous adipogenesis in response to PL exposure. In vivo studies are warranted to determine if concurrent use of MSC with any platelet-derived products such as platelet-rich plasma are associated with synergistic, neutral or antagonistic effects...|$|R
40|$|The <b>utility</b> of the <b>dog</b> as a mine {{detector}} has divided the mine clearance community since dogs were first {{used for this}} purpose during the SecondWorld War. This paper adopts a his-torical perspective to investigate how, why, and to what consequence, the use of minedogs remains contested despite decades of research into their abilities. It explores the changing factors that have made it possible to think that dogs could, or could not, serve as reliable detectors of landmines over time. Beginning with an analysis of the wartime context that shaped the creation of minedogs, the paper then examines two contemporaneous investi-gations undertaken in the 1950 s. The first, a British investigation pursued by the anatomist Solly Zuckerman, concluded that dogs could never be the mine hunter’s best friend. The second, an American study led by the parapsychologist J. B. Rhine, suggested dogs were potentially useful for mine clearance. Drawing on literature from science studies and the emerging subdiscipline of “animal studies, ” it is argued that cross-species intersubjectivity {{played a significant role in}} determining these different positions. The conceptual landscapes of Zuckerman and Rhine’s disciplinary backgrounds are shown to have produced distinct approaches to managing cross-species relations, thus explaining how diverse opinions o...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the ‘western diet' marked a decline in omega- 3 fatty acids rich foods and a concurrent increase in saturated and omega- 6 fatty acids that persists today. Historically, circumpolar people have had a low incidence of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease {{and this has been}} largely attributed to polyphenolic compounds and omega- 3 fatty acids offered from subsistence foods. In this report, we studied sled dogs as an Arctic sentinel species for monitoring the effect of a changing diet on lipid profiles along the Yukon River. Subsistence fed village sled dogs along the Yukon River, maintained largely on salmon were compared with a control kennel maintained on commercial food. Profiles showed higher levels for long chain omega- 3 fatty acids in village subsistence fed dogs compared to control dogs and an opposite trend for omega- 6 fatty acids, establishing baseline levels for follow up studies. A comparison with data for previously published mercury levels from the same cohort of dogs revealed a positive correlation with alpha-linolenic fatty acid and a negative correlation with linoleic fatty acid. Food and nutritional security is a concern in the Arctic as the impacts of climate change and transport of contaminants become obvious.

40|$|Canine {{leishmaniasis}} is a frequently {{diagnosed disease}} in Greece. The earliest available records on canine leishmaniasis {{go back to}} the beginning of the 20 th century concerning dogs living in the area of Athens and later in several other areas in southern Greece. Since then, most of the available epidemiological data mainly concern the two biggest cities Athens and Thessaloniki and the surrounding areas. The objective of the first part of this study was to assess the regional exposure of dogs to Leishmania in Greece by determining its seroprevalence simultaneously in 7 geographical areas in clinically healthy dogs. Blood was collected from dogs living in the following areas: Attiki (1006), Evros (416), Evia (140), Evritania (200), Ioannina (233), Serres (479), Florina (146). A representative sample, regarding the size (more than 2 % of the roughly estimated canine population) and the distribution of dogs within the region was randomly selected. The following data were recorded for each dog using a standard questionnaire: the utility, the gender, the age and the length of haircoat. Differences in the distributions of seropositivity between genders, utilities, ages, type of haircoat and geographical regions in Greece were tested for significance (P< 0. 05) using the Pearson’s χ 2 test. The results of this study support the assumption that canine leishmaniosis is currently endemic in Greece. The highest seroprevalence was detected in dogs living in Attiki 30, 11 % and the lowest in Florina 2 %. Analysis of the results showed no difference in seroprevalence of the disease among groups formed according to the <b>utility</b> of <b>dogs,</b> gender and length of haircoat. On the contrary, a difference in seroprevalence among age groups was observed, which can probably be attributed to the increasing probability of a dog being exposed to Leishmania with time, and mainly to the long incubation period, rather than to a greater susceptibility among the adult dogs. Differences in seroprevalence among dogs living in different geographical regions could be explained by differences in climate, which favorises or not the survival of vectors of Leishmania. On the contrary, although Evros could be a habitat for sandflies, the seroprevalence is low. The wide use of insecticides as part of the programs for the control of olive parasites in the area could explain this result. Regarding the two different methods for antibody detection, no statistically significant differences were observed. The observed serological evidence of exposure to Leishmania of dogs in Greece as in other countries warrants scientists to take measures to reduce it. Evros is an indication that the control of such a disease could be based on the elimination of vectors. The second part of the study was carried out in order to evaluate safety and efficacy of aminosidine in the treatment of canine leishmaniosis in terms of pharmacokinetic behavior, clinical remission, restoration of clinicopathological abnormalities, serological tests, lymph node and bone marrow parasitological...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical thesis. Bibliography: pages 67 - 86. 1. Introduction [...] 2. Literature review [...] 3. Materials {{and methods}} [...] 4. Results [...] 5. Discussion [...] 6. Conclusions. Intense urbanization, {{industrial}} development {{and population growth}} is responsible for reducing environmental quality and in particular increasing the concentrations of contaminants in soils. Exposure to toxic metals and other contaminants in urban soils may be affecting not only the environment, but also the health of humans and other animals. This may especially be the case for those {{in cities such as}} Sydney who are living in residential developments that are in close proximity to past and present industrial centres. This research investigates the <b>utility</b> of domestic <b>dog</b> hair as a surrogate method to determine levels of contamination that may present risks to human health. Because domestic dogs live in the same environment as their owners, the presence of metals in dog hair may indicate a potential risk to human health through soil, dust and atmospheric emissions. Positive linear correlations were found between all metal(loid) s analysed (Cr, Cu, Zn, As, Pb and Hg) and domestic dog hair and soil (p < 0. 05). The strongest correlation between soil and hair concentrations was found for Cr (Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) 0. 355), while there was a weak to negligible relationship for Cu, Zn, As, Hg and Pb (PCCs 0. 090, 0. 084, 0. 137, 0. 089 and 0. 022, respectively). Linear regression analyses showed that correlations were significantly positive for Cr, Cu, Hg and Pb concentrations in dog hair and residential soil, very weakly positive for Zn concentrations and negative for As concentrations. The result also indicated that physiological, ecological and environmental parameters such as age, hair colour, gender and type of diet affected uptake of metals, although this the effect was less for Zn, which is present in most dry dog foods. While there are no national or international standards or guidelines for metal concentrations in hair, the use of hair as a biological matrix offers significant advantages in terms of ease of collection and ethics approval compared with blood and other body tissues. While the correlation between soil and hair concentrations for Pb, As and Hg was weak, any concentration of these metal(loids) in body tissue represents a health risk, and accordingly further research to develop guidelines for contamination exposure using hair has utility, as does the use of domestic dogs as a sentinel for potential human health risks.

This thesis presents a conceptual and practical assessment of the <b>utility</b> of domestic <b>dog</b> serosurveillance for the detection and surveillance of two pathogens, influenza A and Leptospira spp. The first chapter gives a theoretical framework {{that can be used to}} explore the attributes of animal sentinels and assess their utility in different contexts. In subsequent chapters, this framework is applied in a practical assessment of the utility of a domestic dog serosurveillance approach for the detection and surveillance influenza A and Leptospira spp. at two sites in Africa. Two cross-sectional surveys of the avian and mammal populations at a site in Northern Cameroon were conducted in early 2006 to determine if H 5 N 1 influenza A viruses had circulated in this area and in which species that presence could be detected. Serological and molecular evidence of extensive H 5 virus circulation in the domestic duck population was identified. 47 % of domestic ducks at the Maga site were cELISA positive for anti-influenza A antibodies and 20 % were HI test positive against an H 5 N 1 antigen. There was also evidence of exposure to H 5 subtype viruses in the local dog and pig populations. At the Kibera site in Nairobi, a cohort study was established to carry out surveillance of influenza A and Leptospira spp. in the domestic dog population and cross-sectional surveys of the domestic poultry and rodent populations were completed. There was no indication of influenza A circulation in any of the animal species surveyed, indicating low risk of zoonotic influenza A infection in the human population of Kibera. In contrast, there was extensive molecular and serological evidence of the presence of Leptospira spp. in both the rodent and dog populations. 18 % of 236 trapped rodents were PCR positive for kidney carriage of pathogenic leptospires and the estimated seroprevalence of anti- Leptospira antibodies in the dog population ranged from 5 - 36 % during the course of the study, indicating high potential risk of leptospirosis infection in the human population. The results indicate that dog serosurveillance can be used as useful tool for the determination of broad-scale patterns of pathogen presence and relative levels of population exposure. However, there are limitations of the data that can be gathered from animal sentinels and the complexities introduced particularly by incomplete understanding of diagnostic test performance must be recognized. Animal sentinel surveillance may be of most use for addressing fundamental questions of what pathogens are present where. In the developing world particularly where disease burden data are still lacking, dog sentinel serosurveillance can provide essential baseline data that can be used to target future research and resource allocation.

50|$|American Bulldogs are {{typically}} confident, social, and active dogs {{that are at}} ease with their families. It {{is not uncommon for}} an American Bulldog to require a high level of attention due to their highly emotional personality. They bond strongly with their owners. They are capable of jumping in excess of 3 ft vertical due to the dense muscle build of the breed. Young American Bulldogs may be slightly aloof with strangers, but as they mature the breed's normal confidence should assert itself. This breed tolerates children and can do very well with them, provided they are socialized early and understand their limits. The more exposure to good training practices, other dogs, and people, the more likely the success at being controlled both inside and outside of their environment. Early training and socialization both in the home and outside of the home is essential for this breed.
