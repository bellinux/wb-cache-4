5|$|A bulk carrier, bulk freighter, or bulker is a {{merchant}} ship specially designed to transport <b>unpackaged</b> bulk cargo, such as grains, coal, ore, and cement in its cargo holds. Since the first specialized bulk carrier {{was built in}} 1852, economic forces have fuelled {{the development of these}} ships, causing them to grow in size and sophistication. Today's bulkers are specially designed to maximize capacity, safety, efficiency, and durability.|$|E

The ship contained twenty-four conventional lifeboats, two speedboats, and two backup canoes. As part of the ship's post-World War II overhaul, it received sophisticated fire-detection systems. This overhaul resulted in the ship's gross tonnage increasing to 27,666 tons. It had eight large cargo holds, one of which could transport <b>unpackaged</b> cars, and two allowed the transport of refrigerated cargo.|$|E
500|$|There {{are various}} ways {{to define the}} term bulk carrier. As of 1999, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea defines a bulk carrier as [...] "a ship {{constructed}} with a single deck, top side tanks and hopper side tanks in cargo spaces and intended to primarily carry dry cargo in bulk; an ore carrier; or a combination carrier." [...] However, most classification societies use a broader definition where a bulker is any ship that carries dry <b>unpackaged</b> goods. Multipurpose cargo ships can carry bulk cargo, but can also carry other cargoes and are not specifically designed for bulk carriage. The term [...] "dry bulk carrier" [...] is used to distinguish bulkers from bulk liquid carriers such as oil, chemical, or liquefied petroleum gas carriers. [...] Very small bulkers are almost indistinguishable from general cargo ships, and they are often classified based more on the ship's use than its design.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Ligand-conjugated polymer (polyplex) gene {{delivery}} vectors have strong potential as targeted, in vivo gene transfer vehicles; however, {{they are currently}} lim-ited by low delivery efficiency. A number of barriers to polyplex-mediated delivery have been previously identi-fied, including receptor binding, internalization, endo-somal escape, and nuclear localization. However, based on understanding of viral {{gene delivery}} systems, yet an-other potential barrier may exist; a limited ability to un-package the plasmid DNA cargo following localization to the nucleus. We have developed {{a model system that}} employs a cationic polymer linked to epidermal growth factor (EGF) as a ligand to target delivery of plasmid DNA encoding the green fluorescent protein to mouse fibro-blasts bearing the EGF receptor. Using fluorescence mi-croscopy to simultaneously trace both the plasmid and polymer during gene delivery in combination with an in vitro transcription assay, we provide evidence that plas-mid <b>unpackaging</b> can indeed be a limiting step for gene expression for sufficiently large polymer constructs. Short-term expression is significantly enhanced by using short polycations that dissociate from DNA more rapidly both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we describe a thermo-dynamic model that supports these data by showing that shorter polycations can have a higher probability of dis-sociating from DNA. This work demonstrates that vector <b>unpackaging</b> should be added to the list of barriers to receptor-mediated polyplex gene delivery, thus provid-ing an additional design principle for targeted syntheti...|$|R

50|$|Helicases are a {{class of}} enzymes vital to all living organisms. Their main {{function}} is to <b>unpackage</b> an organism's genes. They are motor proteins that move directionally along a nucleic acid phosphodiester backbone, separating two annealed nucleic acid strands (i.e., DNA, RNA, or RNA-DNA hybrid) using energy derived from ATP hydrolysis. There are many helicases resulting from the great variety of processes in which strand separation must be catalyzed. Approximately 1% of eukaryotic genes code for helicases. The human genome codes for 95 non-redundant helicases: 64 RNA helicases and 31 DNA helicases. Many cellular processes, such as DNA replication, transcription, translation, recombination, DNA repair, and ribosome biogenesis involve the separation of nucleic acid strands that necessitates the use of helicases.|$|R

40|$|Previous two-nation {{comparisons}} {{have provided}} evidence that self-efficacy {{may be a}} protective factor against depression in individualist cultures, whereas relationship harmony may be a stronger protective factor in collectivist cultures. However, wider sampling and more specific measures of cultural difference are required to test these conclusions. Student ratings of depression and life satisfaction were surveyed in 10 samples drawn from nine nations. Culture-level individualism positively moderated the relationship of self-efficacy to low depression. However, culture-level collectivism negatively moderated the linkage of relationship harmony to depression. To better understand these effects, four separate nation-level predictors derived from dimensions of self-construal were employed. Effects of self-efficacy were strongest where cultural models of selfhood emphasized self-direction (vs. receptiveness to influence); effects of relationship harmony were strongest where cultural models of selfhood emphasized dependence on others (vs. self-reliance).

40|$|This review {{focuses on}} the growing field of {{research}} concerned with the application of adenovirus proteins to improve the transfection efficiency of synthetic gene delivery systems. Several adenovirus component proteins influence cellular activity of the infecting adenovirus and the overall effect is a highly regulated and efficient infection pathway. It {{is possible that some}} of these proteins may be incorporated into synthetic gene delivery vectors, to Improve specific components of their cellular processing and improve transfection activity. Several adenovirus proteins have been introduced into synthetic vector systems. In particular, the penton base, which participates in cellular entry and endosomal escape of the adenovirus, shows an ability to increase cellular uptake and cytoplasmic penetration of synthetic systems. Similarly, hexon, the major adenovirus coat protein, is involved in the nuclear delivery of the infecting virus and can be exploited for enhancing nuclear targeting of synthetic systems. The possibility of using classical nuclear localization sequences from adenovirus proteins has also been evaluated. Finally, there is considerable interest in the use of adenovirus core proteins, such as mu, to improve properties of DNA condensation and <b>unpackaging</b> following the arrival of synthetic vectors in the nuclei of target cells...|$|R

40|$|The {{modulation}} of DNA accessibility by nucleo-somes is {{a fundamental}} mechanism of gene regu-lation in eukaryotes. The nucleosome core particle (NCP) consists of 147 bp of DNA wrapped around a symmetric octamer of histone proteins. The dy-namics of DNA packaging and <b>unpackaging</b> from the NCP affect all DNA-based chemistries, but de-pend on many factors, including DNA positioning sequence, histone variants and modifications. Al-though {{the structure of the}} intact NCP has been studied by crystallography at atomic resolution, lit-tle is known about the structures of the partially un-wrapped, transient intermediates relevant to nucle-osome dynamics in processes such as transcrip-tion, DNA replication and repair. We apply a new experimental approach combining contrast varia-tion with time-resolved small angle X-ray scatter-ing (TR-SAXS) to determine transient structures of protein and DNA constituents of NCPs during salt-induced disassembly. We measure the structures of unwrapping DNA and monitor protein dissociation from Xenopus laevis histones reconstituted with two model NCP positioning constructs: the Widom 601 sequence and the sea urchin 5 S ribosomal gene. Both constructs reveal asymmetric release of DNA from disrupted histone cores, but display different patterns of protein dissociation.

40|$|Most cryptosystems are {{designed}} and evaluated at a mathematical level. Attackers, however, will always target the physical realisation {{of a system}} {{which is much more}} complicated (see [14] for discussion of this disconnect). Real-world electronic implementations of ciphers will usually leak additional information to attackers in the form of side-channels such as timing, power consumption, electromagnetic radiation, heat, noise, and more. In many cases, an attacker can combine side-channel information with the observed input and/or output of a cryptographic algorithm to recover secret information. It is important to draw a distinction between side-channel cryptanalysis and related physical attacks. Compromising Emanation attacks or tempest attacks utilise electromagnetic emanations from computers to recover secret data, for example using electromagnetic radiation from a computer screen to recover the text being displayed [11] (for a survey, see chapter 17 of [1]). Tempest attacks target secret information directly, completely bypassing the cryptographic keys. Invasive or semi-invasive attacks, in contrast, involve physical manipulation of a target system to extract secret information, for example by <b>unpackaging</b> a chip and reading secret data stored in its memory using a micro-probe or a microscope (see [4, 2] for a survey of physical attacks and defences).

40|$|Histidine {{containing}} reducible polycations {{based on}} CH(6) K(3) H(6) C monomers (His 6 RPCs), are highly effective DNA transfection agents combining pH buffering endosomal escape mechanisms with rapid <b>unpackaging</b> following {{reduction in the}} cytoplasm. We examined their ability to mediate siRNA uptake into cells focusing on hepatocyte delivery. Co-delivery of EGFP siRNA with pEGFP plasmid DNA reduced reporter gene expression by 85 %. However while DNA transfection efficiency increased with polymer size, with 162 k His 6 RPCs proving the most effective, delivery of siRNA alone to EGFP stably expressing cells was only possible using 36 - 80 k polymers. Analysis of particle sizes showed that 80 k polymers formed more compact siRNA complexes than 162 k polymers. The reducible nature of the polymer was necessary for siRNA activity, since siRNA combined with non-reducible polylysine showed little activity. Incorporation of a targeting peptide from the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite (CS) protein onto His 6 RPCs, significantly improved transfection of plasmid DNA and siRNA activity in hepatocytes, but not in most non-liver cells tested. siRNA targeted to the hepatitis B virus surface antigen delivered by CS-His 6 RPC, mediated falls in both mRNA and protein expression, suggesting that this delivery system could be developed for potential therapies for viral hepatitis...|$|R
