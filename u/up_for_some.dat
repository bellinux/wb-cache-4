In November 1846, Isambard Kingdom Brunel's iron ship SS Great Britain ran aground on the sands of Dundrum Bay, Ireland. There was doubt as to whether she could be re-floated. Brunel advised that if anyone could rescue the ship then the man to do it was the naval engineer James Bremner. He was engaged and the Great Britain was re-floated on 27 August 1847 {{with the assistance of}} HMS Birkenhead.|$|E

During this time, Mrs. Worden personally brought news of her husband's progress and recovery and was optimistic, informing the crew his eyesight would soon return but he would be laid <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time. She also informed them President Lincoln had personally paid Worden a visit extending his gratitude. However Worden was later taken to his summer home in New York and remained unconscious for three months. He returned to Naval service in 1862 as Commander of , another ironclad.|$|E

25|$|Accepting {{only the}} axiom schema of {{specification}} {{was the beginning}} of axiomatic set theory. Most of the other Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms (but not the axiom of extensionality or the axiom of regularity) then became necessary to make <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> of what was lost by changing the axiom schema of comprehension to the axiom schema of specification – each of these axioms states that a certain set exists, and defines that set by giving a predicate for its members to satisfy, i.e. it is a special case of the axiom schema of comprehension.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, while touring {{in support}} of War Profiteering is Killing Us All, the band {{abruptly}} broke up. Explanations given by the band members for this included Vandeberghe's desire {{to take a break}} from touring, which he did while friend Steve McCrumb filled for a performance at the Troubadour in Los Angeles on May 11. A tour of Mexico had been planned to follow this, and Navarro had suggested that the band perform its final shows that Christmas. However, interpersonal tensions came to a head after the Troubadour show when Lukacinsky refused to finish the tour. Lukacinsky himself further elaborated that the band had been planning to break <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time.|$|E
500|$|Mania Entertainment's Megan Lavey said Syaoran's and Sakura's initial {{relationship}} is a [...] "pretty simple love story", and liked their personalities. IGN's Jeff Harris said Syaoran's role is interesting because he sacrifices {{his relationship with}} Sakura and his own life to recover her memories. Active Anime's Christopher Seaman said the romantic relationship between them {{is one of the}} most mature parts of the series, and it helped balance the other fantastic themes, which added more variety for the series' audience. Kimlinger said their relationship made <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> problems in the anime adaptation. Kimlinger also said Jason Liebrecht's role as Syaoran's English voice is better than Irino's work. However, Kimlinger praised both performances because of the way Syaoran's emotions are played.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{received}} generally well by critics. Brian Zoromski of IGN stated that: [...] "Any episode that places Michael and Dwight {{outside of their}} normal office environment is set <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> very funny (and usually awkward) situations and 'The Convention' is no exception. Some of the episode's best uncomfortable moments centered on Michael believing he's {{the life of the}} party and that he's Jim's friend. Michael and Dwight pretending to laugh along to an inside joke made by Jim's new boss, Josh, is a prime example. Michael's comment, 'I love inside jokes. Love to be part of one someday,' creates the kind of uncomfortable silence that The Office excels at." [...] Also on IGN, the show received a 9.8 out of 10 [...] "incredible" [...] rating from the site's editorial staff.|$|E

Nine months after the crash, he told New York Daily News reporter Michael Iachetta, [...] "Songs are in my head like they always are. And they're not going to get written down until some things are evened up. Not until some people come forth and make <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> {{of the things that have}} happened." [...] After discussing the crash with Dylan, biographer Robert Shelton concluded that he [...] "was saying there must be another way of life for the pop star, in which he is in control, not they. He had to find ways of working to his own advantage with the recording industry. He had to come to terms with his one-time friend, longtime manager, part-time neighbor, and sometime landlord, Albert Grossman." ...|$|E
500|$|Media {{commentators}} characterized Sévérine as a femme fatale and an anti-heroine. Time's Lily Rothman viewed Marlohe as a [...] "mix of {{good and}} evil, strong and vulnerable, aloof and <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> intimacy with the ever-seductive 007". Julian Sancton of Forbes cited Sévérine {{as an example of}} [...] "the femme fatale whose moral ambiguity matches James Bond's own," [...] while Yahoo!'s Frank DiGiacomo regarded the character as complicated. The former described the character's personality as a combination of [...] "panther-like sexiness", [...] "snaky qualities", and fear. While discussing Sévérine's impact on the plot, Alyssa Rosenberg of ThinkProgress interpreted her as a pawn in the conflict between Bond and Silva. Sévérine has a titular instrumental track on the film's soundtrack, which is a [...] "string-drenched" [...] piece playing during her sex scene with Bond. To pass China's censorship laws, references to prostitution were removed from the subtitles. Sévérine's tattoo was changed from a symbol of a Chinese sex trafficking operation to that of a gang.|$|E

500|$|Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth {{received}} generally favorable reviews, but {{was also}} often criticized for being buggy and inaccessible for many players because of its high difficulty. GameSpy ranked it as the tenth best game of E3 2004 while GameSpot nominated it for their [...] "Most Surprisingly Good Game of 2005" [...] award, with a comment that [...] "after a development cycle that was nearing infinity, it's {{hard to imagine a}} world where this H.P. Lovecraft-based horror game turned out all right. Luckily for us, we don't have to imagine it." [...] According to IGN, the game [...] "succeeds brilliantly in some areas," [...] making [...] "great use of the source material" [...] and forcing players [...] "to accept some realistic responsibility for their character" [...] due to the sanity system and HUD-less display, but can make the players [...] "cringe at the difficult nature of the game." [...] Greg Kasavin of GameSpot opined [...] "a thick, unsettling atmosphere fills this ambitious first-person action-adventure, which makes <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> frustrating moments and dated graphics with plenty of chills, variety, and originality." [...] Cheat Code Central's Cole Smith called it [...] "one of the greatest book to game translations ever" [...] and a game [...] "that is full of twists, turns and incredibly wonderful scary surprises. It's got a great atmosphere which is sustained by dark and grainy graphics, chilling sound effects and an incredibly improbable storyline that is treated properly as to suspend reality from creeping in and ruining your experience." [...] GameSpy's Allen Rausch wrote [...] "this disturbing slice of Lovecraft's America is well worth the time to visit," [...] as [...] "despite the occasional missteps, Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth is a more than fitting tribute to its literary inspiration." [...] Similarly, Kyle Williams of Gaming Target called it [...] "a labor of love" [...] that [...] "defies convention in favor of creating a videogame experience that is a worthy heir to the Lovecraft name." [...] Team Xbox's Matthew Fisher wrote that, despite some of the game's various shortcomings regarding the graphics and some of the detective aspects, [...] "this is an immersive experience that is a new and unique title for the Xbox, which is more than a welcome change. Was it worth the wait? Absolutely." [...] Despite the mostly positive reviews, the game was a commercial failure.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Arab raid was not {{followed}} <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time, and the restoration of ties with Constantinople, Byzantine rule over Africa was shaken to its roots by Gregory's rebellion and the Arab victory. The Berber tribes in particular shook off their allegiance to the Empire, and most of southern Tunisia seems to have slipped outside the control of Carthage. Thus the Battle of Sufetula marked [...] "the end, more or less near, but inevitable, of Byzantine domination in Africa" [...] (Diehl).|$|E

2500|$|The Australian Mounted Division {{followed}} by the 5th Cavalry Division and Desert Mounted Corps headquarters left Tiberias on 27 September to begin the pursuit to Damascus.
