The 1986 Tokyo National Theater and Opera House project continued the research that Tschumi began in The Manhattan Transcripts, importing notational techniques from experimental dance and musical scores, and using the design process itself to challenge habitual ways of thinking about space, in contrast to earlier static, two dimensional representational techniques which delineated the outline of a building but not the intensity of life within it. [...] At a local scale in his 1990 Video Pavilion at Groningen, transparent walls and tilted floors produce an intense dislocation of the subject in relation to norms like wall, interior and exterior, and horizon. [...] At the urban scale in such projects as the 1992 Le Fresnoy, Studio National des Arts Contemporains, in Tourcoing, France, and the 1995 architecture school at Marne la Vallee, France (both completed 1999), larger spaces challenge normative program sequence and accepted use. The Le Fresnoy complex accomplishes this by its use of the space between the roofs of existing buildings and an added, huge <b>umbrella</b> <b>roof</b> above them which creates an interstitial zone of program on ramps and catwalks. [...] This zone is what Tschumi calls the in-between, a negation of pure form or style that had been practiced in the 1989 ZKM Karlsruhe competition project, where a large atrium space punctuated by encapsulated circulation and smaller program episodes developed a more local network of interstitial space.|$|E
6000|$|I saw to my {{surprise}} two heaps of dry sticks, which a schoolboy might have taken for birds' nests; the rude beds, boughs, torn off from the tree, not gathered, were built in forks, one ten and the other twenty feet above ground, and both were canopied by the tufted tops. Every hunter consulted upon the subject ridiculed the branchy roof tied with vines, and declared that the Nchigo's industry is confined to a place for sitting, not for shelter; that he fashions no other dwelling; that a couple generally occupies the same or some neighbouring tree, each sitting upon its own nest; that the Nchígo is not a [...] "hermit" [...] nor a rare, nor even a very timid animal; that it dwells, as I saw, near villages, and that its cry, [...] "Aoo! Aoo! Aoo!" [...] is often heard by them in the mornings and evenings. During my subsequent wanderings in Gorilla land, I often observed tall and mushroom- shaped trees standing singly, and wearing the semblance of the <b>umbrella</b> <b>roof.</b> What most puzzles me is, that M. du Chaillu ("Second Expedition," [...] chap, iii.) [...] "had two of the bowers cut down {{and sent to the}} British Museum." [...] He adds, [...] "They are formed at a height of twenty to thirty feet in the trees, by the animals bending over and intertwining a number of the weaker boughs, so as to form bowers, under which they can sit, protected from the rains by the masses of foliage thus entangled together, some of the boughs being so bent that they form convenient seats." [...] Surely M. du Chaillu must have been deceived by some vagary of nature.|$|E

50|$|The sculptural {{group of}} the church’s eastern facade differs in {{composition}} from the similar bas-reliefs of Sanahin, Haghpat, and Harich. It shows two men in monks’ attire who point with their hands at a church model {{and a picture of}} a dove with half-spread wings placed between them. The <b>umbrella</b> <b>roofing</b> of the model’s dome shows the original look of the dome of Astvatsatsin church. The figures are shown wearing different dresses — the one standing right is dressed more richly than the one standing left. The faces, with their long whiskers, luxuriant combed beards and large almond shaped eyes, are also executed in different manners. These are probably the founders of the church, the Father Superior and his assistant.|$|R
50|$|Strollers (also {{known as}} push chairs or buggies) are {{a mean of}} {{transportation}} for infants up to around the age of 3 or 4. Variants of strollers include twin strollers as well as triple strollers. Strollers come typically with multiple functionalities including an <b>umbrella</b> like <b>roof</b> to prevent {{a large amount of}} sun to enter the stroller, the ability to detach the seat and become a car seat, the ability to fold for ease of transportation by car, and more as new designs and features are being created. Strollers do include safety guidelines that can be found here.|$|R

40|$|Changes in {{inhibitor}} {{activity in}} the onion bulbs (Allium cepa L.) cv. Sochaczewska during storage were investigated. Onions were dried under an <b>umbrella</b> <b>roof</b> until October 15 th or November 15 th and thereafter stored in a cold-room at 0 - 1 °C until May 15 th. The activity of inhibitors fluctuated markedly during the storage period. At least two peaks and two decreases of inhibitor activity were observed. The weather conditions seemed to strongly influence the level and the date of appearance of inhibitors in onions. Higher inhibitor activity is usually connected with better storage and less sprouting of onions during storage. Prolonged drying under an <b>umbrella</b> <b>roof</b> enhanced onion quality after storage only in these cases when it actually improved the drying of onions...|$|E

During 4 -year of experiment gibberellin activity was determined each month during storage. Three periods of high activity of gibberellins were found in most cases: in December, in February-March and in late spring. In general, onions dried longer (till November 15 th), showed lower gibberellin activity than onions dried shorter. Gibberellin-like substances under investigation are localized in almost all Rf zones of chromatogram. Sprouting and rooting was related to gibberellin activity...|$|E

During 4 years of the experiment, the activity of cytokinin-like substances was determined each month during storage. The cytokinin activity showed two to three peaks: {{at the beginning of}} storage, in January-February (in one year in December) {{and at the end of}} the storage period. No clear correlation was found between cytokinin activity and bulb rooting or sprouting. The length of the drying period occasionally influenced the height of cytokinin activity peaks and displaced the moment of their appearance.

5000|$|The {{church of}} S. Astvatsatsin is {{situated}} {{adjacent to the}} entrance of the cemetery and monastic complex at Talin and near the main cathedral. It is a small cruciform central-planned building with a Byzantine-style single red tile, octagonal <b>umbrella</b> domed <b>roof</b> that is centered over the church. The dome sits above an octagonal drum that is pierced by four small windows. A decorative geometric projecting cornice trims the dome and gable roof. There is a single entrance to the building from the western façade, with an inscription written upon the half-rounded tympanum above. The inscription attests to a construction date in the 7th century. It reads the following passage: ...|$|R
40|$|Restrictions {{on smoking}} {{outdoors}} {{have been introduced}} for reasons of public amenity and to promote litter reduction. This review considers the evidence about whether outdoor secondhand smoke (SHS) might also pose health risks to others. Six published studies have assessed outdoor levels of SHS using metred PM 2. 5 as a marker of exposure. The magnitude of PM 2. 5 {{is dependent on the}} number of smokers present, proximity of the measurement device to the source of the SHS, {{the extent to which the}} outdoor space is physically constrained (e. g., walls, partial <b>roof,</b> <b>umbrellas),</b> and wind. The data show peak outdoor PM 2. 5 levels in semi-enclosed areas with several smokers present can be comparable to those recorded in indoor smoky environments. However, outdoor PM 2. 5 levels are more transient as the smoke plume is less confined and can rapidly dissipate. SHS can be a major source of PM 2. 5, particularly in indoor environments. The average PM 2. 5 level in bars where smoking occurs is 303 µg/m 3 and 157 µg/m 3 in restaurants. Because of repeated and cumulative exposure to SHS in outdoor settings like beer gardens and outdoor eating areas, occupational exposures to PM 2. 5 from SHS are likely to be far higher than those experienced by patrons who are present for far shorter periods. We estimate that occupational exposure to SHS in waitstaff working in outdoor patio areas where smoking is allowed could average 1. 6 to 9. 8 µg/m 3 per year. It is thus plausible that occupational exposure to PM 2. 5 in outdoor work settings where smoking is allowed could exceed the Australian National Environment Protection Measure for Ambient Air Quality benchmark annual average target of 8 µg/m 3. An increase of 5 µg/m 3 to 10 µg/m 3 in average annual PM 2. 5 exposure is associated with a 3 - 6...|$|R
