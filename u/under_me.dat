500|$|Privately, and in {{correspondence}} with others, {{they were less}} generous: Hay grumbled that while McKinley would give him his full attention, Roosevelt was always busy with others, {{and it would be}} [...] "an hour's wait for a minute's talk". Roosevelt, after Hay's death in 1905, wrote to Senator Lodge that Hay had not been [...] "a great Secretary of State... <b>under</b> <b>me</b> he accomplished little... his usefulness to me was almost exclusively the usefulness of a fine figurehead". Nevertheless, when Roosevelt successfully sought election in his own right in 1904, he persuaded the aging and infirm Hay to campaign for him, and Hay gave a speech linking the administration's policies with those of Lincoln: [...] "there is not a principle avowed by the Republican party to-day which is out of harmony with his [...] teaching or inconsistent with his character." [...] Kushner and Sherrill suggested that the differences between Hay and Roosevelt were more style than ideological substance.|$|E

500|$|Still in {{a shallow}} dive, I {{observed}} another P-38 and an Me 109 going round and round. It seemed that the 38 needed help so I started down.

I rolled over on my back, following him and gave him an ineffective burst at long range. By this time I was traveling in excess of [...] My left window blew out, scaring {{the hell out of}} me. I thought I had been hit by some of the ground fire I had observed in the vicinity. I regained control of the aircraft and pulled out above a wheat field. I tried to contact the flight to get myself recognized, but observed an Me 109 making a pass at me from about seven o'clock high. I broke left as well as my plane could and the Jerry overshot. I straightened out and gave him a burst. He chandelled steeply to the left and I shot some more. He passed right over me and I slipped over in an Immelmann. As I straightened out at the top, I saw the pilot bail out.|$|E
500|$|In 1975, after George Moscone {{had been}} elected Mayor, he {{appointed}} Charles Gain as his Chief of Police. Gain, whose conciliatory position towards African Americans had branded {{him as one of}} the most liberal law enforcement officers in the country, soon earned the ire of the police force. Gain implemented policies that proved unpopular with his staff, such as painting police cars powder blue, and barring officers from drinking on the job. His lenient policies towards gays also angered the police force. When asked what he would do if a gay police officer came out, Gain replied [...] "I certainly think that a gay policeman could be up front about it <b>under</b> <b>me.</b> If I had a gay policeman who came out, I would support him 100 percent." [...] This statement sent shockwaves through the police department, and made national headlines. Made during the first week of Gain's tenure, the remark also made Mayor Moscone extremely unpopular with the police. The two were so intensely disliked by the police that in 1977 rumors circulated about a plan by right-wing police officers to assassinate Gain, and a year later similar plans formed targeting Mayor Moscone. Upon being informed of this threat, Moscone hired a bodyguard.|$|E
500|$|Secretariat raced in Meadow Stables' blue-and-white-checkered colors. He never raced {{in track}} bandages, but {{typically}} wore a blinker hood, mostly {{to help him}} focus, but also {{because he had a}} tendency to run in towards the rail during races. In January 1972, he joined trainer Lucien Laurin's winter stable at Hialeah. Secretariat gained a reputation as a kind horse, likeable and unruffled in crowds or by the bumping that occurs between young horses. He had the physique of a runner, but at first was awkward and clumsy. He was frequently outpaced by more precocious stable mates, running a quarter-mile in 26 seconds compared to 23 seconds by his peers. His regular exercise riders were Jim Gaffney and Charlie Davis. Davis was not initially impressed. [...] "He was a big fat sucker", Davis said. [...] "I mean, he was big. He wasn't in a hurry to do nothin'. He took his time. The quality was there, but he didn't show it until he wanted to." [...] Gaffney though recalled his first ride on Secretariat in early 1972 as [...] "having this big red machine <b>under</b> <b>me,</b> and from that very first day I knew he had a power of strength that I have never felt before..." ...|$|E

500|$|Padres {{general manager}} Kevin Towers said Hoffman {{was the first}} one in and the last one out of the {{ballpark}} everyday. Hoffman adhered to a daily conditioning program. When pitcher Jeremy Fikac was promoted to the majors in 2001, Hoffman invited him to join him on his usual afternoon run. [...] "I remember sitting in the bullpen that night, and my legs were still trembling from the run", Fikac recalled. [...] "I'd run before, but not at that pace ... I was thinking, I hope they don't call on me because I can't feel my legs <b>under</b> <b>me</b> ... His work ethic is unbelievable." [...] Bochy said, [...] " [...] one of those guys like Tony Gwynn—they never feel like they've arrived. Tony never thought, 'Well, I'm hitting [...]360 ... ' He was never content. And Trevor's the same way. They just keep working and make sure that they've got goals they want to reach." [...] After every save opportunity, whether he converted it or blew it, Hoffman would sit in the dugout for up to five minutes after his teammates had cleared out. Whether it was the euphoria from success or the sting of failure, he would sit there and drain all the emotion out of himself, put the game behind him, and move on. Tracy Hoffman said, [...] "He's all about order. That's the foundation to what he does. You see it when he's on the field. He's always the same, win or lose. He doesn't smile, doesn't show any emotion." [...] Padres manager Bud Black marveled at Hoffman's regimen. [...] "The daily preparation for his job, that focus and dedication each day to prepare for the ninth inning ... It was incredible to see live", said Black. [...] "I played with George Brett, a Hall of Famer who was a great worker. But Trevor took it to a level and a commitment and Hall of Fame caliber." [...] After Hoffman resurrected his final season and recorded his 600th save, Macha said Hoffman's [...] "work ethic and perseverance paid off ... He had to grind it out to get there." ...|$|E

Although it was dusk, the ship was so close that I had no difficulty in making out her name. I talked to the captain and expected that he would put out a yawl and pick me up.

I have never seen him since, nor do I ever want to see him by the great hokey, pokey.|$|E

A few weeks before the fight, it was revealed that the bout would be postponed to February 20, 2010. The match was put in jeopardy due to economic disagreements but was later confirmed to be on April 10, 2010, at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas. When asked about his upcoming bout, the four-time world heavyweight champion said: [...] "I've been hearing for a while that I can't do it. All it does is light a fire <b>under</b> <b>me</b> to prove people wrong." [...] He also added: [...] "I can still fight. I don't want to leave until I've become the undisputed heavyweight champion one more time. That's been my goal the entire time." [...] The American boxer scored an eighth-round knockout of Botha to win the vacant World Boxing Federation (WBF) Heavyweight title.|$|E

Darkness gathers around, far distant thunder rolls over the trembling hills; the black clouds with august majesty and power, moves slowly forwards, shading regions of towering hills, and threatening all the destructions of a thunderstorm; all around is now still as death, not a whisper is heard, but a total inactivity and silence seems to pervade the earth; the birds afraid to utter a chirrup, and in low tremulous voices take leave of each other, seeking covert and safety; every insect is silenced, and nothing heard but the roaring of the approaching hurricane; the mighty cloud now expands its sable wings, extending from North to South, and is driven irresistibly {{on by the}} tumultuous winds, spreading his livid wings around the gloomy concave, armed with terrors of thunder and fiery shafts of lightning; now the lofty forests bend low beneath its fury, their limbs and wavy boughs are tossed about and catch hold of each other; the mountains tremble and seem to reel about, and the ancient hills to be shaken to their foundations: the furious storm sweeps along, smoaking through the vale and over the resounding hills; {{the face of the}} earth is obscured by the deluge descending from the firmament, and I am deafened by the din of thunder; the tempestuous scene damps my spirits, and my horse sinks <b>under</b> <b>me</b> at the tremendous peals, as I hasten for the plain." ...|$|E
2500|$|Xu Yin (徐胤), the Army Inspector (監軍) of the Jin {{garrison}} at Badong (巴東), led marine forces towards Jianping (建平), while Yang Zhao (楊肇), the Inspector (刺史) of Jing Province (also under Jin control), led troops towards Xiling. Lu Kang gave orders as such: Zhang Xian {{to reinforce}} Jiangling's defences; Sun Zun (孫遵), the Commandant of Gong'an (公安), {{to patrol the}} south river bank and resist Yang Hu; naval commander Liu Lü (留慮) and General Who Guards the West (鎮西將軍) Zhu Wan (朱琬) to defend against Xu Yin. He personally led three armies to hold off Yang Zhao {{with the aid of}} the defensive structures they constructed earlier. However, Lu Kang's subordinates Zhu Qiao (朱喬) and Yu Zan (俞贊) defected to Yang Zhao's side instead. Lu Kang said, [...] "Yu Zan has been serving <b>under</b> <b>me</b> {{for a long time and}} he is very aware of my situation. He knows that the tribal soldiers in my army may be unwilling to follow my orders, so he'll definitely suggest to the enemy to take advantage of this weakness." [...] Hence, that night, Lu Kang immediately replaced the tribal soldiers in his army with other veteran soldiers whom he trusted more. The following day, as Lu Kang expected, Yang Zhao concentrated his attacks on the unit in Lu Kang's army which used to be made up of tribal soldiers, without knowing that they had been replaced. Lu Kang ordered his archers to retaliate, raining arrows on the enemy and inflicting heavy casualties.|$|E
