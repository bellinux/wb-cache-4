5|$|In {{the second}} setting, the player guides Harry Mason in an over-the-shoulder view as he {{searches}} for his missing daughter Cheryl in the snowy town of Silent Hill. Harry {{is equipped with}} a smartphone and flashlight: he can <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> to check his location on a Global Positioning System map, take photographs, and make telephone calls. Moving to certain spots with high interference, represented by a lot of radio noise, or by taking pictures of spots where shadowy figures can be seen, unlock various text and voicemail messages that expand the story and occasionally provide clues. To view the details of various documents, the player can zoom in on objects. The game also alters details of gameplay based on what the player views. Throughout his journey, Harry encounters puzzles such as mechanisms, which reward either a key required to progress or a bonus memento. In the Wii version, the Wii Remote is used for puzzle solving and to control the flashlight and cell phone.|$|E
5|$|E.T. is an {{adventure}} {{game in which}} players control an alien (E.T.) from a top-down perspective. The objective {{of the game is}} to collect three pieces of an interplanetary telephone. The pieces are found scattered randomly throughout various pits (also referred to as wells). The player is provided with an on-screen energy bar, which decreases when E.T. performs any actions (including moving, teleporting, or falling into a pit, as well as levitating back to the top). To prevent this, E.T. can collect Reese's Pieces, which are used to restore his energy or, when nine are collected, E.T. can call Elliott to obtain a piece of the telephone, or the player can save the candy pieces for bonus points at the end. After the three phone pieces have been collected, the player must guide E.T. to an area where he can <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> which allows him to call his home planet. When the call is made, E.T. must reach the spaceship in a given time limit. Once E.T. gets to the forest where his ship abandoned him and stands and waits in the designated area for the ship to come, the ship will appear on screen and take him back to his home planet. Then the game starts over, with the same difficulty level, while changing the location of the telephone pieces. The score obtained during the round is carried over to the next iteration. The game ends when the energy bar depletes. E.T. has three lives and if he dies within those three lives Elliot will come in and revive him. E.T. can get a fourth life if the player is lucky enough to find a geranium in one of the wells. It turns into a sprite from some games that Howard Scott Warshaw made, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark.|$|E

500|$|The Earl was {{frequently}} {{depicted in the}} British tabloids for his drug use, wild parties and homosexuality. In May 1983, he was arrested on suspicion of trafficking $4 million of heroin and moved from New York back to Ickworth House. While there, {{on at least one}} occasion, the Earl piloted his helicopter without radar while snorting cocaine off the map he was using for navigation. On another, while accompanying his secretary Angela Barry, he crash-landed the helicopter in a field, and walked to the nearest farmhouse, demanding to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> while leaving mud everywhere. He became known for his dark sense of humour; on one occasion he allowed a young woman to ride a rubber dinghy {{into the middle of the}} lake at Ickworth and then shot at it with an air rifle, sinking it. On another, he was accused of opening a fridge door to retrieve a bottle of champagne by blasting it with a shotgun. He once drove along the hard shoulder of the M11 motorway at [...] to avoid traffic congestion.|$|E
500|$|... "The Chinese Restaurant" [...] {{was written}} by series co-creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones, who directed all of season two's episodes. David {{came up with the}} idea of the real-time episode while he and Seinfeld were waiting for a table at a Chinese restaurant in Los Angeles. When David presented the episode to NBC executives, he received a negative reaction. The network felt that there was no real story and viewers would not be interested. Executive Warren Littlefield commented that he thought there were pages missing from the script he had received. David argued that each character had a storyline: Jerry's story was he recognized a woman but did not know from where; Elaine's story was that she was very hungry; and George's story was that he was unable to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> NBC disagreed and objected to the broadcast of the episode. To satisfy the executives, staff writer Larry Charles suggested the group's storyline to be on their way to a one-night screening of Plan 9 from Outer Space, and thus introducing a [...] "ticking clock" [...] scenario to the story. When the NBC executives still objected, David threatened to quit the show if the network would force any major changes upon the script. Seinfeld supported David and NBC eventually allowed them to produce [...] "The Chinese Restaurant" [...] without any significant alterations, although they strongly advised them not go through with it, and postponed the broadcast until near the end of the season. In 2015, Seinfeld writer Spike Feresten revealed that the host's calling [...] "Cartwright" [...] instead of [...] "Costanza" [...] was a subtle allusion to the classic western show Bonanza. [...] "Bonanza" [...] rhymes with [...] "Costanza" [...] and the show's main characters are the [...] "Cartwright" [...] family.|$|E

2500|$|The typical police box {{contained}} a telephone linked {{directly to the}} local police station, allowing patrolling officers to keep {{in contact with the}} station, reporting anything unusual or requesting help if necessary.

2500|$|However, the [...] "Full National Number" [...] may {{always be}} dialled.

[...] Thus, it is strongly recommended that telephone numbers should be stored in mobile phones {{in the form of}} the full [...] "International Number", should the owner of the phone be likely to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> concerned in an area away from [...] "home", either within Australia or internationally.|$|E
