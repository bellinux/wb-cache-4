5|$|After {{the success}} of Mayabazar (1957), {{directed}} by Kadiri Venkata Reddy, B. Nagi Reddy and Aluri Chakrapani of Vijaya Vauhini Studios planned to make a contemporary drama. Chakrapani came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> about conflict between two older men who are polar opposites: one a debtor evading his creditors, {{and the other a}} wealthy gentleman with an inflated sense of prestige. L. V. Prasad was chosen to direct the film; he, Chakrapani and Vempati Sadasivabrahmam developed a script entitled Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu, after a popular Telugu idiom. It was the only film from Vijaya Vauhini Studios with dialogue written by Sadasivabrahmam.|$|E

The {{demolition}} derby form flies into her hand, and she decides {{to give it a}} try. When she leaves, Homer wakes up and finds Marge is gone and so is the demolition derby form, so he heads off to the derby with the kids to stop her. Although Marge initially enjoys the demolition derby, things soon get too dangerous for her. Homer has no idea how to save her, as he has given up being reckless. Bart comes <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> and calls for a beer can from a vendor. Homer then drinks the beer and rescues Marge (in a style similar to Popeye), who makes him promise not to make her the live wire in the family.|$|E

5|$|Once the {{operation}} is complete, Heiter attempts to train his centipede as a pet, often belittling Katsuro with racist insults and beating him with a crop when he becomes rebellious. When Katsuro defecates, Lindsay is forced to swallow his excrement while the doctor watches in delight. However, he eventually becomes irritated after being kept awake by the constant screaming of Katsuro (who, as the front part of the centipede, has his mouth free and is still able to speak) and the realization that Jenny is dying from septicemia. When two detectives, Kranz (Andreas Leupold) and Voller (Peter Blankenstein), visit the house to investigate the disappearance of tourists, Heiter comes <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> to add them as replacements for Jenny in a new creation; a four-segment centipede. He offers the two detectives water spiked with sedatives in hopes of knocking the two unconscious. After being given the water, the detectives become suspicious and obtain a search warrant for his home. While the detectives leave Heiter's home, the victims attempt to escape. Katsuro attacks Heiter in the process. Their attempt to escape ultimately fails. Katsuro confesses to the doctor that he deserves his fate because he had treated his own family poorly, then commits suicide by slitting his throat with a glass shard.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} {{writing the}} dialogue, Takumi was called into another meeting with Inaba, {{and was told}} to add a new gameplay mechanic to the investigations. Takumi {{wanted to keep the}} gameplay simple enough for his mother {{to be able to play}} it, and keep it focused on the core concept of finding lies; according to him, he immediately had a vision of the psyche lock system during the meeting with Inaba, but still asked for three days to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea.</b> He found it easy to formulate the idea, but it took over a month to create the system; the biggest problem was how to visually represent the psyche locks. Takumi also drew storyboards for the episodes' openings, which consisted of series of detailed drawings that show what is happening. He also drew rough sketches of cut-in illustrations; it was only decided after all the text had been written what scenes would have illustrations made for them. While the game's opening features the judge, it was originally supposed to have featured a demon instead; this was because Takumi was playing Devil May Cry at the time, and had liked its opening. As Takumi wanted the first three Ace Attorney games to be part of one larger work, he did not want the first game to look outdated in comparison to later ones, so it was decided to keep the same graphics for main characters such as Phoenix, Maya and Edgeworth throughout all their appearances, and not make updates to them. The game's music was composed by Naoto Tanaka under the pseudonym Akemi Kimura.|$|E

25|$|In an {{interview}} with Collider.com, Miller mentioned the small possibility of Happy Feet Three, stating that if he came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> for a third film, {{that he and his}} studio would produce it if they both agreed the idea was better than the first two. As of now, however, he has yet to mention if he has any ideas for a third film since the interview.|$|E
25|$|Goldman {{returned}} to novels, writing The Thing of It Is... (1967). He went {{to teach at}} Princeton, and wanted to write something but could not come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> for a novel. So he decided to write his first original screenplay, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, {{which he had been}} researching for eight years.

The resulting movie was a massive critical and commercial success and earned Goldman an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.|$|E

Modern day biometrics is a cutting edge technology which enables the automated system to distinguish between a genuine person and an imposter. Automated face recognition and speaker recognition are the areas of biometrics which are widely used because of the uniqueness of one human to other human. In this paper we have come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>idea</b> of having <b>a</b> 3 level security which will enhance the security of high profile places. Security includes face recognition using eigenface algorithm, speaker recognition using Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficient (MFCC) and RFID card technique...|$|R
25|$|When In Flames were {{recording}} {{their second}} studio album, The Jester Race, Anders Fridén and Niklas Sundin came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> {{to create a}} symbol/mascot for In Flames.

This symbol made its first appearance in the cover artwork of The Jester Race and ever since, the Jester has been featured in various forms somewhere on every studio album that In Flames has released, either as a song title or on the album artwork. The Jester Head is also featured in lots of In Flames' merchandise and has been featured in banners as part of In Flames' live set.|$|E
25|$|A {{few years}} later, {{following}} {{the success of}} The Good Life, Spence was asked by BBC Radio to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> for a programme to feature Keith. Thinking of Keith's character in The Good Life, Spence had {{the idea of an}} upper-class version of Margo Leadbetter and, from the account from the comedian, came up with Audrey fforbes-Hamilton. Instead of a Cockney comedian as the new owner of the manor, Spence decided on an American who sees the manor while in England looking for his roots. The American later discovers he is descended from the fforbes-Hamiltons. This was made into a radio pilot in 1976 with Bernard Braden as the American, but was never broadcast because of the interest to make it into a TV series.|$|E
25|$|Sun He {{heard that}} Cai Ying (蔡穎), {{a member of}} his {{personal}} staff, enjoyed playing weiqi and that many of Cai Ying's subordinates also picked up the game and {{spent a lot of time}} playing. As he saw that weiqi was an unproductive activity meant to be a hobby or pastime, he became worried that Cai Ying and the others would become complacent and neglect their duties from playing too much weiqi. He thus came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> to subtly remind and motivate his subordinates. He called for a meeting and asked them to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of playing weiqi. One of them, Wei Yao (韋曜), went home, wrote an essay on this topic and presented it to Sun He, who had copies of it distributed among his personal staff.|$|E

25|$|While {{the project}} was still in its initial stage of development, bitter {{disagreements}} and quarrels broke out among the scholars {{due to differences in}} opinion. Xu Ci and Hu Qian started making accusations and taking petty revenge against each other. They bickered among themselves and constantly sought opportunities to provoke each other. They also praised themselves and scorned their colleagues. When Liu Bei heard about it, he came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> to urge them to put aside their differences and cooperate with each other. He gathered all the officials for a feast and had actors put up a skit parodying the conflict between Xu Ci and Hu Qian, showing how a war of words between them led to them using weapons to attack each other. Despite Liu Bei's efforts, the project ultimately {{turned out to be a}} failure.|$|E
25|$|The creators found {{themselves}} with {{a problem with the}} character of Lt. Aiden Ford (Rainbow Sun Francks) in season two, a first season regular that the producers, and the actor himself, felt had not worked as intended and was highly underused as a result. Unwilling to write him out, the writers came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> to make the character more important, but that downgraded him to recurring. To replace him, they created Ronon Dex as a sidekick for Lt. Col. John Sheppard, but finding an actor with the physical presence and the acting ability necessary was not easy until they saw Jason Momoa's tape. X-files veteran Mitch Pileggi and Kavan Smith were added to the cast in the recurring roles of Col. Steven Caldwell and Maj. Evan Lorne. Paul McGillion's character, Dr. Carson Beckett, became a regular in season two.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1928, Disney {{traveled}} to New York City in hopes of negotiating a more profitable contract with his producer Charles Mintz. But as economic problems were apparent at the time, Mintz figured Disney should settle for a 20 percent cut, although large turnarounds were promised if the studio's finances showed considerable growth. While most of his fellow animators left for Mintz's studio, Disney decided to quit and therefore leave the character he created. On his long train ride home, he came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> to create another character, and retain rights to it. He and Iwerks {{would go on to}} develop a new cartoon in secret, starring a new character which would soon become the most successful and popular cartoon character in film history and later become the foundation of a global entertainment empire. The first Mickey Mouse cartoon to be filmed was Plane Crazy in the summer of 1928, but it was produced as a silent and held back from release. The first Mickey Mouse film with a synchronized soundtrack, Steamboat Willie, reached the screen that fall and became a major hit, eclipsing Oswald. Plane Crazy was later given its own synchronized soundtrack and released on May 15, 1928.|$|E
