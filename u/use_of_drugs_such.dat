25|$|Physical {{factors that}} can lead to sexual {{dysfunctions}} include the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs,</b> <b>such</b> as alcohol, nicotine, narcotics, stimulants, antihypertensives, antihistamines, and some psychotherapeutic drugs. For women, almost any physiological change that affects the reproductive system—premenstrual syndrome, pregnancy and the postpartum period, menopause—can have an adverse effect on libido. Injuries to the back may also impact sexual activity, as can problems with an enlarged prostate gland, problems with blood supply, or nerve damage (as in sexual dysfunction after spinal cord injuries). Diseases such as diabetic neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, tumors, and, rarely, tertiary syphilis may also impact the activity, as could the failure of various organ systems (such as the heart and lungs), endocrine disorders (thyroid, pituitary, or adrenal gland problems), hormonal deficiencies (low testosterone, other androgens, or estrogen) and some birth defects.|$|E
2500|$|Tremor can be {{a symptom}} {{associated}} with disorders in {{those parts of the}} brain that control muscles throughout the body or in particular areas, such as the hands. Neurological disorders or conditions that can produce tremor include multiple sclerosis, stroke, traumatic brain injury, chronic kidney disease and a number of [...] neurodegenerative diseases that damage or destroy parts of the brainstem or the cerebellum, [...] Parkinson's disease being the one most often associated with tremor. Other causes include the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> (<b>such</b> as amphetamines, cocaine, caffeine, corticosteroids, SSRIs) or alcohol, mercury poisoning, or the withdrawal of drugs such as alcohol or benzodiazepine. Tremors can also be seen in infants with phenylketonuria (PKU), overactive thyroid or liver failure. Tremors {{can be a}}n indication of hypoglycemia, along with palpitations, sweating and anxiety.|$|E

2500|$|Ulcerative colitis can {{be treated}} {{with a number of}} medications, {{including}} 5-ASA drugs such as sulfasalazine and mesalazine. Corticosteroids such as prednisone can also be used due to their immunosuppressive and short-term healing properties, but because their risks outweigh their benefits, they are not used long-term in treatment. Immunosuppressive medications such as azathioprine and biological agents such as infliximab and adalimumab are given only if people cannot achieve remission with 5-ASA and corticosteroids. Such treatments are used less commonly [...] due to their possible risk factors, including but not limited to increased risk of cancers in teenagers and adults, tuberculosis, and new or worsening heart failure (these side effects are rare). A formulation of budesonide was approved by the FDA for treatment of active ulcerative colitis in January 2013. The evidence on methotrexate does not show a benefit in producing remission in people with ulcerative colitis. Off-label <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>such</b> as ciclosporin and tacrolimus has shown some benefits. Fexofenadine, an antihistamine drug used in treatment of allergies, has shown promise in a combination therapy in some studies. Opportunely, low gastrointestinal absorption (or high absorbed drug gastrointestinal secretion) of fexofenadine results in higher concentration at the site of inflammation. Thus, the drug may locally decrease histamine secretion by involved gastrointestinal mast cells and alleviate the inflammation.|$|E

50|$|Correlations {{between the}} usage of drugs and dreaming have been documented, {{particularly}} the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs,</b> <b>such</b> as sedatives, and the suppression of dreaming because of drugging effects on the cycles and stages of sleep while not allowing the user to reach REM. Drugs used for their stimulating properties (cocaine, methamphetamine, and ecstasy) have shown to also decrease the restorative properties of REM sleep and its duration.|$|E
50|$|Current {{available}} {{treatment is}} limited to treating the symptoms, not the cause. Seizure frequency can be regulated by the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>such</b> as Clonazepam (or other benzodiazepines) and Sodium Valproate. Clonazepam functions by increasing GABA activity at the GABAA receptor. GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter and therefore, its increased activity hyperpolarizes cells. Clonazepam has been effective in minimising seizure activity, especially during puberty. Sodium valproate prevents the depolarization of the cell by blocking sodium ion channels and inhibitory GABA enzymes. Both of these anticonvulsants lead to depression of the central nervous system.|$|E
5000|$|The effect lesions on the {{brainstem}} {{have on the}} ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) {{has also}} been hypothesized. It was proposed that since the ARAS {{plays a role in}} consciousness and waking, the lesions of the brainstem common to peduncular hallucinosis may “disrupt ARAS impulses from the brainstem reticular formation” and, as a consequence, lead to the sleep disturbances characteristic of peduncular hallucinosis. The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>such</b> as Olanzapine may help treat sleep disturbances as it has been found to “improve sleep continuity, sleep quality, and to increase slow wave sleep.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Unlike most antiarrhythmics, BRL-32872’s {{effects are}} {{homogeneous}} within the various cardiac tissue types (nodal cells, cardiomyocytes, Purkinje fibers). This property helps eliminate repolarization dispersion, a proarrhythmial effect noted in class III agents. BRL-32872 does not exhibit reverse-use dependence; meaning efficacy is conserved regardless of heart rate. The drug is also easily administered orally or via intravenous injection, {{and has no}} effect on resting membrane potential. The effects BRL-32872 have been well documented in animal models. However, its effect has not yet been demonstrated in humans. These beneficial experimental results make a strong case for the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>such</b> as BRL-32872, with combined K+/Ca+2 [...] inhibition, in first line antiarrhythmial treatment.|$|E
50|$|Often, apathy is felt after {{witnessing}} horrific acts, such as {{the killing}} or maiming of people during a war, e.g. posttraumatic stress disorder. It is also {{known to be a}} distinct psychiatric syndrome that is associated with many conditions, some of which are: CADASIL syndrome, depression, Alzheimer's disease, Chagas disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, dementia (and dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and frontotemporal dementia), Korsakoff's syndrome, excessive vitamin D; hypothyroidism; hyperthyroidism; general fatigue; Huntington's disease; Pick's disease; progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP); schizophrenia; schizoid personality disorder; bipolar disorder;, autism, Asperger's syndrome, and others. Some medications and the heavy <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>such</b> as opiates or GABA-ergic drugs may bring apathy as a side effect.|$|E
50|$|Kraepelin had {{experimented with}} {{hypnosis}} but found it wanting, and disapproved of Freud's and Jung's introduction, based on no evidence, of psychogenic assumptions to the interpretation {{and treatment of}} mental illness. He argued that, without knowing the underlying cause of dementia praecox or manic-depressive illness, {{there could be no}} disease-specific treatment, and recommended the use of long baths and the occasional <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>such</b> as opiates and barbiturates for the amelioration of distress, as well as occupational activities, where suitable, for all institutionalized patients. Based on his theory that dementia praecox is the product of autointoxication emanating from the sex glands, Kraepelin experimented, without success, with injections of thyroid, gonad and other glandular extracts.|$|E
50|$|Regular <b>use</b> <b>of</b> {{over-the-counter}} <b>drugs</b> <b>such</b> as paracetamol and NSAIDs {{can also}} be a cause of MOH.

40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{research}} has focused on initiation into drug use and factors that increase the risk of initiation or protect against it. Initiation into the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> some <b>drugs</b> (<b>such</b> as alcohol) is extremely common, whereas initiation into <b>use</b> <b>of</b> other <b>drugs</b> (<b>such</b> as cocaine) is less frequent (Kandel 1975). Regardless of initiation rate, most individuals who try a particular drug do not continue into a pattern of abuse, although different substances appear to differ in their abuse potential. For example, many adults in the United States can be considered “social ” drinkers, but a much smaller percentage are considered “problem ” drinkers. The abuse potential of cocaine is considered to be much higher among those individuals who continue to use on a regular basis. Newcomb (1992) found that about 15 percent of young adult alcohol users had developed a pattern of dependency, whereas about one-third of those who had used cocaine within the previous 6 months showed a pattern of dependency.

50|$|A {{resurgence}} of barebacking in first-world gay communities during the 1990s {{has been a}} frequent topic for gay columnists and editorialists in The Advocate, Genre magazine, and Out magazine. Many of these articles express concern over bareback sex's popularity, and liken it to irresponsible and reckless behavior, {{despite the fact that}} a third of gay men take part in the practice. An article in the online resource The Body lists no fewer than 22 reasons why barebacking has become increasingly acceptable in the gay community. Some of the reasons listed are: the recent perception of HIV as a treatable illness one can live with, insufficient sex education, <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>such</b> as crystal meth in sexual settings, and fetishization of bareback sex on various porn and dating sites.|$|E

5000|$|A {{closely related}} disease to brain {{ischemia}} is brain hypoxia. Brain hypoxia is the {{condition in which}} there is a decrease in the oxygen supply to the brain even in the presence of adequate blood flow. If hypoxia lasts for long periods of time, coma, seizures, and even brain death may occur. Symptoms of brain hypoxia are similar to ischemia and include inattentiveness, poor judgment, memory loss, and a decrease in motor coordination. [...] Potential causes of brain hypoxia are suffocation, carbon monoxide poisoning, severe anemia, and <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>such</b> as cocaine and other amphetamines. [...] Other causes associated with brain hypoxia include drowning, strangling, choking, cardiac arrest, head trauma, and complications during general anesthesia. Treatment strategies for brain hypoxia vary depending on the original cause of injury.|$|E
5|$|Recent evidence, however, has {{suggested}} against {{the contention that}} the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> psilocybin puts one at risk for developing long lasting mental disorders.
