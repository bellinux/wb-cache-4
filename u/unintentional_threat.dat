50|$|In modern times, {{almost all}} threats to golden eagles are attributable, {{directly}} or indirectly, to human activities. In fact, all Aquila eagles in Eurasia {{face the same}} human-sourced threats as the golden eagle: habitat change, persecution, poisoning (often directed at other species) and collisions with man-made objects. Certainly the most widespread <b>unintentional</b> <b>threat</b> to golden eagles by humans is urbanization and human-population growth which have made areas historically used by eagles unsuitable {{both in terms of}} habitat and prey availability. Habitat destruction in North America had, by the late 19th century, already driven golden eagles from some regions they used to inhabit. In Southern California and the Colorado Front Range, this has been proved via long-term population and habitat surveys. In Western China, the main threats to golden eagles are land development, the use of pesticides and apparent regular captures for falconry. Fires since 1980 have caused large-scale losses of shrubs and jackrabbit habitat in areas used by eagles throughout the Intermountain West of North America. Wildfires that burned more 40,000 hectares of scrublands between 1981 and 1987 in the Morley Nelson Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area affected nesting populations adversely. Nesting success at burned territories in Snake River Canyon declined after major fires. Abandoned burned territories have been subsumed by neighboring pairs, resulting in a decreased number of nesting pairs. In a few cases, mankind has accidentally benefited golden eagles by logging previously heavily wooded areas. This has been recorded in the 1800s and 1900s in the Appalachian Mountains of the Eastern United States, where reforestation has now made the habitat unsuitable for nesting eagles, and in Washington state, which still holds breeding eagles in desolate areas that have been logged. Afforestation, the commercial planting of non-native woodland, is a serious issue in Scotland, with the largest amount of it occurring in southwestern Scotland, especially in Argyll. During afforestation, the land is ploughed and in excess of 2,500 seedlings are planted per hectare, mainly with exotic conifers including Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta). The woodland canopy closes and ground vegetation dies, making these dark and gloomy places until harvesting in 40 to 50 years. More than 50% of land in Scotland at an elevation of 200 - 600 m has been planted as such. Afforestation requires removal of sheep and the fencing out or shooting deer, both important sources of carrion for golden eagles. Foraging areas of golden eagles have been confirmed to not include afforested areas.|$|E

Biosecurity is {{a modern}} term created out of a need to protect, in our case poultry, from an {{intentional}} or <b>unintentional</b> <b>threat</b> from a biological agent. In our everyday management, biosecurity is an endless endeavor to keep viral disease agents and/or the spread of such disease agents at bay. We have learned from our own personal welfare that by keeping our environment clean, i. e., 2 ̆ 2 cleanliness is next to godliness 2 ̆ 2 and by reducing contact with infected people or animals, i. e., 2 ̆ 2 being a good neighbor, 2 ̆ 2 we can reduce our chance of catching or spreading disease.

2500|$|Human action {{presents}} both intentional and <b>unintentional</b> <b>threats</b> to the species' survival. Intentional threats include continued hunting, poaching and egg harvesting. More dangerous are <b>unintentional</b> <b>threats,</b> including boat strikes, fishermen's nets {{that lack}} turtle excluder devices, pollution and habitat destruction. Chemical pollution may create tumors; effluent from harbors near nesting sites may create disturbances; and light pollution may disorient hatchlings. Habitat loss usually occurs due to human development of nesting areas. Beach-front construction, land [...] "reclamation" [...] and increased tourism {{are examples of}} such development. An infectious tumor-causing disease, fibropapillomatosis, is also a problem in some populations. The disease kills a sizeable fraction of those it infects, though some individuals seem to resist the disease. In addition, {{at least in the}} Southwestern Atlantic (Río de la Plata, Uruguay), exotic invasive species such as the rapa whelk Rapana venosa, were reported massively bio-fouling immature green turtles, reducing buoyancy, increasing drag, and causing severe injuries to the carapace. Because of these threats, many populations are in a vulnerable state.|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Several information security threats exist that can exploit vulnerabilities in active implantable medical devices, but experts caution that efforts to mitigate information security risks may adversely affect device performance. Threats to active devicesthat is, devices that rely on a power source to operatethat also have wireless capability can be unintentional, such as interference from electromagnetic energy in the environment, or intentional, such as the unauthorized accessing of a device. Several experts consider certain threats to be of greater concern than others; for example, experts noted less concern about interference from electromagnetic energy than other threats. Incidents resulting from <b>unintentional</b> <b>threats</b> have occurred, such as a malfunction resulting from electromagnetic interference, but have since been addressed. Although researchers have recently demonstrated the potential for incidents resulting from intentional threats in two devicesan implantable cardioverter defibrillator and an insulin pumpno such actual incidents {{are known to have}} occurred, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Medical devices may have several such vulnerabilities that make them susceptible to <b>unintentional</b> and intentional <b>threats,</b> including untested software and firmware and limited battery life. Information security risks resulting from certain threats and vulnerabilities could affect the safety and effectiveness of medical devices.

40|$|Wireless {{networks}} are more depicted to intentional or <b>unintentional</b> <b>threats</b> than their wired based equivalent networks. Major reason being the wireless medium {{which can be}} approached by others, who can listen and interfere in an on-going valid communication. In {{the absence of a}} collision detection mechanism and relying mainly on cooperation of each other for packet routing, the standard defined for wireless network is unable to identify any malicious activity, by default. Among attacks the ones which create isolation of the nodes on the network are considered more severe. If they last long enough, can result in denial-of-service and hence network collapses completely. The simplest form of such attacks is jamming attack which can block any current legitimate communication. It is easy to launch as no especial hardware is required and the area in range for a particular time can be jammed for any legal communication. Jamming is a specialized Denial of Service attack in which purpose is not to overflow buffers, instead to choke the physical communication channel, hence avoiding jammer is much harder than other forms of denial of service attacks. Unlike other attacks, especially routing attacks, no network parameter and topology etc need to be known in advance before launching jamming attack. However, if the network parameters are known and the attack is intelligently placed, a jammer can last longer resulting in more survival time on the network and damage. This paper surveys on different types of jamming attack and the mitigation techniques generally used. Besides this, we investigate about the approaches proposed that are considered efficient to survive in a jammed region, actively. Finally, we conclude by highlighting the potential areas which can be targeted to optimize in minimizing the effects of a jamming attack, as future directions...|$|R

40|$|In plants, {{balancing}} selection {{may cause}} {{the retention of}} polymorphism important for adaptation in populations over long time spans and is best known to affect genes for disease and abiotic stress responses. The inadvertent removal of polymorphism from domesticated populations otherwise maintained by balancing selection, has sometimes met with catastrophic consequences in the past. e. g. Irish potato famine. Similarly, the <b>unintentional</b> <b>threats</b> {{from the loss of}} adaptive diversity and inbreeding to the fitness of natural populations that undergo reductions in size or fragmentation, are also widely documented. A better understanding of the prevalence of balancing selection, its modes of action (heterozygote advantage, frequency-dependent selection and selection varying in time and space), and the genes it affects, might reveal new ways to manage and mitigate against the loss of adaptive variation during domestication or range depletion. The present study used comparative genome analysis to identify genes under balancing selection. Thirty four candidate genes for wood formation were screened for SNP common to the Symphyomyrtus and Eucalyptus subgenera of the Eucalyptus genus. These trans-subgeneric SNP derive from ancestral polymorphisms that are maintained in each lineage post-speciation by balancing selection. Genes containing clusters of trans-specific SNP are good models for monitoring the loss of adaptive variation because the drivers of selection in these genes may be universal in eucalypts. The study showed balancing selection was more common among candidate genes for wood formation than might be expected on average in a genome, nonetheless, this high frequency was congruent with potential pleiotropic roles for these genes in disease and abiotic stress responses. Strong evidence for balancing selection was found in ten genes where there was a prevalence of trans-subgeneric SNP clustered in functional gene regions. Association testing was used to find candidate genes subject to balancing selection that also influenced physical and chemical wood phenotypes of interest for tree improvement. Pectin methylesterases catalyse the de-methyl-esterification of homogalacturonan, the major constituent of pectin, and have pleiotropic functions in wood formation, seed dormancy, fruit ripening and stress responses. Associated with wood quality and a gene where adaptive variation was maintained through a heterozygote advantage, one member of the pectin methylesterase gene-class may be a useful subject for exploring the consequences of diversity reduction at genes subject to balancing selectio...|$|R
30|$|Cyber FF is {{one class}} of cyber {{security}} failures. Since {{it is based}} in human failure, we have argued that cyber FF belongs to a sub-class of cyber security failures that is characterized by <b>unintentional</b> insider <b>threats.</b> There {{is a tendency to}} regard such failures as aberrations that can be fixed with technological advances, such as technology solutions to improve SA, to increase accuracy in identifying targets, or to improve the precision of defensive or offensive actions. We have argued that a sound mitigation strategy, whether or not incorporating technological advancements, must be focused on identifying and accommodating the realities of human performance. Contributing factors attributed to cyber FF must be empirically studied along with the benefits of training, awareness, and tools meant to reduce the number and severity of incidents. To this end, we have described a preliminary study that we conducted that demonstrates cyber FF research in a controlled, isolated testbed environment. While results where speculative due to the small number of participants, it does demonstrate that experimentation in a testbed can advance the research goals described within.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{addresses}} cognitive {{implications and}} research needs surrounding {{the problem of}} cyber friendly fire (FF). We define cyber FF as intentional offensive or defensive cyber/electronic actions intended to protect cyber systems against enemy forces or to attack enemy cyber systems, which unintentionally harms the mission effectiveness of friendly or neutral forces. We describe examples of cyber FF and discuss how it fits within a general conceptual framework for cyber security failures. Because it involves human failure, cyber FF may be considered {{to belong to a}} sub-class of cyber security failures characterized as <b>unintentional</b> insider <b>threats.</b> Cyber FF is closely related to combat friendly fire in that maintaining situation awareness (SA) is paramount to avoiding unintended consequences. Cyber SA concerns knowledge of a system’s topology (connectedness and relationships of the nodes in a system), and critical knowledge elements such as the characteristics and vulnerabilities of the components that comprise the system and its nodes, the nature of the activities or work performed, and the available defensive and offensive countermeasures that may be applied to thwart network attacks. We describe a test bed designed to support empirical research on factors affecting cyber FF. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies to combat cyber FF, including both training concepts and suggestions for decision aids and visualization approaches.|$|R
