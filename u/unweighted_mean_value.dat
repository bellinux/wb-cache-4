40|$|We {{report a}} new {{detection}} of neutral deuterium in the sub Damped Lyman Alpha system with low metallicity [O/H] = - 2. 042 ± 0. 005 at z_ abs= 2. 437 towards QSO J 1444 + 2919. The hydrogen column density {{in this system}} is logN(H i) = 19. 983 ± 0. 010 and the measured value of deuterium abundance is log(D/H) =- 4. 706 ± 0. 007 _ stat± 0. 067 _ syst. This system meets the set of strict selection criteria stated recently by Cooke et al. and, therefore, widens the Precision Sample of D/H. However, possible underestimation of systematic errors can bring bias into the mean D/H value (especially if use a weighted mean). Hence, it might be reasonable to relax these selection criteria and, thus, {{increase the number of}} acceptable absorption systems with measured D/H values. In addition, an <b>unweighted</b> <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> might be more appropriate to describe the primordial deuterium abundance. The <b>unweighted</b> <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> of the whole D/H data sample available to date (15 measurements) gives a conservative value of the primordial deuterium abundance (D/H) _ p=(2. 55 ± 0. 19) × 10 ^- 5 which is in good agreement with the prediction of analysis of the cosmic microwave background radiation for the standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis. By means of the derived (D/H) _ p value the baryon density of the Universe Ω_ bh^ 2 = 0. 0222 ± 0. 0013 and the baryon-to-photon ratio η_ 10 = 6. 09 ± 0. 36 have been deduced. These values have confident intervals which are less stringent than that obtained for the Precision Sample and, thus, leave a broader window for new physics. The latter is particularly important {{in the light of the}} lithium problem. Comment: Submitted to MNRAS, 10 pages, 7 figures, 3 table...|$|E

We discuss in detail possible systematic errors in our infrared solutions and conclude that the typical total uncertainty of the infrared distance and radius of a Cepheid is about 3 percent in both infrared solutions, provided that the data are of excellent quality and that the amplitude of the color curve used in the solution is larger than ~ 0. 3 mag. We compare the adopted infrared distances of the Cepheid variables to the ZAMS-fitting distances of their supposed host clusters and associations and find an <b>unweighted</b> <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> of the distance ratio of 1. 02 +- 0. 04. A detailed discussion of the individual Cepheids shows that the uncertainty of the ZAMS-fitting distances varies considerably from cluster to cluster. We find clear evidence that four Cepheids are not cluster members (SZ Tau, T Mon, U Car and SV Vul) while we confirm cluster membership for V Cen and BB Sgr for which the former evidence for cluster membership was only weak. After rejection of non-members, we find a weighted mean distance ratio of 0. 969 +- 0. 014, {{with a standard deviation of}} 0. 05, which demonstrates that both distance indicators are accurate to better than 5 %, including systematic errors, and that there is excellent agreement between both distance scales...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{compare the}} {{prognostic}} ability of first available measurements of CD 4 cell count and viral load {{with that of}} the most recent measurements and to assess the additional prognostic ability of the values of past measurements of these markers. Methods. Demographic and clinical information on 965 HIV- 1 infected adults followed at a university-based HIV clinic in Montreal, Quebec were extracted from a clinical database. The prognostic ability of initial and most recent CD 4 cell count and viral load measurements were assessed in a series of Cox models. The added prognostic ability of past values of measurements of these markers was explored by calculating; (i) the <b>unweighted</b> <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> of all previous measurements and (ii) a time-weighted mean. The differences between these mean levels and the most recent values were included as time-dependent covariates in Cox models adjusted for the value of the most recent measurements. Conclusion. The most recent measurements of CD 4 cell count and viral load are more powerful predictors of clinical disease progression than initial measurements. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} survey of CII* absorption detections toward stars within 100 pc {{in order to}} measure the distribution of electron densities present in the local interstellar medium (LISM). Using high spectral resolution observations of nearby stars obtained by GHRS and STIS onboard the Hubble Space Telescope, we identify 13 sight lines with 23 individual CII* absorption components, which provide electron density measurements, the vast majority of which are new. We employ several strategies to determine more accurate CII column densities from the saturated CII resonance line, including, constraints of the line width from the optically thin CII* line, constraints from independent temperature measurements of the LISM gas based on line widths of other ions, and third, using measured SII column densities as a proxy for CII column densities. The sample of electron densities appears consistent with a log-normal distribution and an <b>unweighted</b> <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> of n_e(CII_SII) = 0. 11 ^+ 0. 10 _- 0. 05 cm^- 3. Seven individual sight lines probe the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC), and all present a similar value for the electron density, with a weighted mean of n_e(LIC) = 0. 12 +/- 0. 04 cm^- 3. The Hyades Cloud, a decelerated cloud at {{the leading edge of the}} platoon of LISM clouds, has a significantly higher electron density than the LIC. Observed toward G 191 -B 2 B, the high electron density may be caused by the lack of shielding from such a strong radiation source. Given some simple assumptions, the range of observed electron densities translates into a range of thermal pressures, P/k = 3300 ^+ 5500 _- 1900 K cm^- 3. This work greatly expands the number of electron density measurements and provides important constraints on the ionization, abundance, and evolutionary models of the local interstellar medium.

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 Measuring {{the source}} and {{magnitude}} of components of variation has important applications in industrial, environmental and biological studies. This thesis considers the problem of constructing confidence intervals for variance components in Gaussian mixed linear models. A number of methods based on the usual ANOVA mean squares have been proposed for constructing confidence intervals for variance components in balanced mixed models. Some authors have suggested extending balanced model procedures to unbalanced models by replacing the ANOVA mean squares with mean squares from an <b>unweighted</b> <b>means</b> ANOVA. However, the <b>unweighted</b> <b>means</b> ANOVA is only defined for a few specific mixed models. In Chapter 2 we define a generalization of the <b>unweighted</b> <b>means</b> ANOVA for the three variance component mixed linear model and illustrate how the mean squares from this ANOVA {{may be used to}} construct confidence intervals for variance components. Computer simulations indicate that the proposed procedure gives intervals that are generally consistent with the stated confidence level, except in the case of extremely unbalanced designs. A set of statistics that can be used {{as an alternative to the}} generalized <b>unweighted</b> <b>mean</b> squares is developed in Chapter 3. The intervals constructed with these statistics have better coverage probability and are often narrower than the intervals constructed with the generalized <b>unweighted</b> <b>mean</b> squares...|$|R

This thesis studies the Growth Curve model in multivariate statistics which is a model that is not widely used. One difference compared with the linear model is that the Maximum Likelihood Estimators are more complicated.

From this perspective this thesis will compare the traditional mean estimator for the Growth Curve model with the <b>unweighted</b> <b>mean</b> estimator. The <b>unweighted</b> <b>mean</b> estimator is simpler than the regular MLE. It will be proven that the unweighted estimator is in fact the MLE under certain conditions and examples when this occurs will be discussed.

40|$|After spinal surgery, {{patients}} often want to {{know whether}} driving a car or using public transportation can be dangerous for their spine. In order to answer this question, a clinically proven vertebral body replacement (VBR) has been modified. Six load sensors and a telemetry unit were integrated into the inductively powered implant. The modified implant allows the measurement of six load components. Telemeterized devices were implanted in five patients; four of them agreed to exposure themselves to whole-body vibration. During the measurements, the patients sat on a driver seat fixed to a hexapod. They were exposed to random single-axis vibrations in X, Y, and Z directions as well as in multi-axis XYZ directions with frequencies between 0. 3 and 30  Hz. Three intensity levels (<b>unweighted</b> root <b>mean</b> square <b>values</b> of 0. 25, 0. 5 and 1. 0  m/s 2) were applied. Three postures were studied: sitting freely, using a vertical backrest, and a backrest declined by an angle of 25 °. The patients held their hands on their thighs. As expected, the maximum force on the VBR increased with increasing intensity and the number of axes. For the highest intensity level and multi-axis vibration, the maximum forces increased by 89 % compared to sitting relaxed. Leaning at the backrest as well as lower intensity levels markedly decreased the implant loads. Driving a car or using public transportation systems—when the patient leans towards the backrest—leads to lower implant loads than walking, and can therefore be allowed already shortly after surgery...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{extended}} <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> E(r, s;x, y) play {{an important}} role in theory of <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> and theory of inequalities, and even in the whole math-ematics, since many norms in mathematics are always means. Its study is not only interesting but important, both because most of the two-variable <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> are special cases of E(r, s;x, y), and because it is challenging to study a function whose formulation is so indeterminate. In this expositive article, we summarize the recent main results about study of E(r, s;x, y), including definition, basic properties, monotonicities, compar-ison, logarithmic convexities, Schur-convexities, generalizations of concepts of <b>mean</b> <b>values,</b> applications to quantum, to theory of special functions, to es-tablishment of Steffensen pairs, and to generalization of Hermite-Hadamard’s inequality. 1. Definition and expressions of the extended <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> The histories of <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> and inequalities are long [9]. The <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> are related to the <b>Mean</b> <b>Value</b> Theorems for derivative or for integral, which are the bridge between the local and global properties of functions. The arithmetic-mean-geometric-mean inequality is probably the most important inequality, and certainly a keystone of the theory of inequalities [2].
