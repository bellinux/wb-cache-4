5|$|The TuđmanĆosić {{agreement}} on the pullout of JNA troops from Konavle provoked an emotional response in Yugoslavia, where it was interpreted as a defeat and betrayal. Following the agreement, the Prevlaka Peninsula was demilitarized and placed under the United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka (UNMOP), established by the <b>UN</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> Resolution 779 of 6 October 1992. The resolution placed the peninsula {{under the control of}} UNPROFOR.

5|$|A very {{frequently}} discussed {{change to the}} UN structure {{is to change the}} permanent membership of the <b>UN</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council,</b> which reflects the power structure of the world as it was in 1945.

5|$|There {{were several}} more {{attempts}} to advocate the Z-4 Plan {{as the basis}} of a political settlement of the Croatian War of Independence. After Croatia captured western Slavonia from the RSK in Operation Flash in early May, Owen and Stoltenberg invited Croatian and RSK officials to Geneva in an effort to revive the plan. The initiative was endorsed by the <b>UN</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> and the G7, which was preparing its summit in Halifax at the time. The meeting was attended by Owen, Stoltenberg, Galbraith, Kerestedjiants, Eide and Ahrens as the international diplomats; the RSK was represented by Martić, Mikelić and Babić, and the Croatian delegation was led by Šarinić. Šarinić accepted the invitation, claiming that the venue was a Croatian concession because Croatian authorities considered the issue an internal matter which should normally be dealt with in Croatia. On the other hand, the RSK delegation insisted on Croatian withdrawal from the territory captured earlier that month before negotiations could proceed. Since no such withdrawal was requested by the <b>UN</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council,</b> Croatia rejected the demand and the initiative collapsed.|$|E
