40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} a large evaluation of user perspectives on voice mail system performance as measured by message transmission delay. Over 1000 state employee respondents completed survey questions rating system speed (as presented in a standardized user interface questionnaire) and tolerance for message transmission delay {{in a variety of}} situational task contexts. Results of the study indicate that situation variables (message <b>urgency,</b> <b>message</b> context, and sender-receiver distance) affected user ratings of maximum acceptable transmission delay. In addition, user experience as measured by frequency of system use, but not length of exposure to the system, {{was a significant predictor of}} evaluations of what constituted acceptable voice mail message delivery performance. Users dynamically change their expectations and tolerances for “adequate” system performance based on system use and task demands. These results provide implications for future studies of diffusion of innovations and organizational implementation of new information technology systems.

Islamic Jurisprudence (Fiqh), as a discipline of Islamic law must be able to answer the problems of humanity in a "good and proper" manner in order to be relevant. In this regards, understanding of the theory of Islamic law (Usul al-Fiqh), as the methodology of understanding Islamic teachings, must be willing to open up and do not be bound by the classical theory which is exclusive-deductive in nature. It needs to and collaborate with other scientific disciplines, such as sociology, anthropology and so forth. One alternative way is by paying attention to the ethical messages of the Qur 2 ̆ 7 an which are more normative-universal. To find out which messages are normative and the particular historical-technical nature, the method of "double movement" offered by Fazlur Rahman deserves a careful attention...|$|E

40|$|A {{field study}} in ten homes was {{conducted}} to understand what influences users’ acceptability of notifications in the home environment. The key finding is that perceived <b>message</b> <b>urgency</b> is the primary indicator of acceptability of notifications in the home—if people think a message is urgent, they want the message to be shown immediately, regardless {{of what they are}} doing at the time of notification. The study also shows that the acceptability of low-urgent and medium-urgent messages could be improved by taking into account mental activity load at the time of notification. No effect of physical activity was found on acceptability. The results suggest that to improve the scheduling of notifications in the home, notification systems need a mechanism assessing both the <b>message</b> <b>urgency</b> and the mental activity load, whereas physical activity can be ignored. From a methodological point of view, it is difficult to measure acceptability of notifications in a realistic setting, given the need to balance experimental control with realistic context. The present paper suggests a way to introduce controlled notifications and subjective measurements of acceptability in homes. Industrial DesignIndustrial Design Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Disasters occur {{anywhere}} {{around the}} world at unexpected times and they cannot usually be predicted or avoided. When a disaster arises, {{a significant proportion of}} the surrounding population is devastated. One of the most important features of coping with any disaster is maintaining communication, as it is essential for both management and recovery. Traditional forms of communication may not be possible {{due to the nature of}} the disaster; it is likely that the previous network infrastructure will be destroyed. Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) can provide a feasible solution. DTNs consist of mobile nodes that can communicate with each other even if a route connecting them never exists. They do not need an end-to-end connection and routes can be dynamically built when and where they are required. This makes them applicable for deployment in disaster scenarios. DTNs use protocols to deliver messages to their destinations, however the existing protocols have numerous problems. The existing DTN routing protocols do not prioritise messages based on their content. This concept leads to the idea of optimising an existing protocol to forward messages based on their urgency as opposed to their existing structure. Various disaster simulations were created using the Opportunistic Network Environment (ONE) Simulator, which can be used to simulate and evaluate how DTN routing protocols disseminate their messages. ONE was used to test the overall performances in order to see if the optimised protocol performed better than the existing version in the given scenarios. The resulting protocol (Disaster Optimised Spray and Wait) significantly increased the delivery probability of high <b>urgency</b> <b>messages</b> while maintaining the overall delivery probability. The average latency was slightly increased, yet this increase was essential and justified. The overhead ratio remained relatively constant and did not hinder the overall performance. Therefore an efficient protocol was produced, which would in theory be suitable for deployment in countless numbers of disaster scenarios...|$|R

40|$|Quality of Service (QoS) for MANETs {{becomes a}} {{necessity}} {{because of its}} applications in decisive situations such as battle fields, flood and earth quake. Users belonging to diverse hierarchical category demanding various levels of QoS use MANETs. Sometimes, even a low category user may need to send an urgent message in time critical applications. Hence providing prioritization based on user category and <b>urgency</b> of the <b>message</b> the user is sending becomes necessary. In this paper we propose Enhanced MAC parameters to support Hybrid Dynamic priority in MANETs(H-MAC). It combines both prioritization based on user categorization and dynamic exigency. Order Statistics is used to implement dynamic priority. We propose dynamic TXOP, Proportional AIFS and Proportional dynamic Backoff timers based on weights and collision, to avoid packet dropping and starvation of lower priorities. The model is simulated in ns 2. We compare our results with IEEE 802. 11 e and show that, 16 % more throughput is achieved by H-MAC during extensive collision. We also observe that starvation and packet drops are reduced with proportionate bandwidth sharing compared to the existing model. Comment: 7 page...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the use of}} IEEE 802. 11 e for {{priority}} based messaging in Military Inter-Vehicle Communications (IVC). In the battlefield, messages generated by military vehicles (i. e., urgent combat related messages, warning messages) have different priorities which have different performance requirements in terms of delay and reliability. The message priorities are assigned based on the <b>urgency</b> of the <b>message.</b> For example, combat related messages will have the highest priority which {{is reflected in the}} lowest delay and highest reliability. We investigate the use of IEEE 802. 11 e to provide such priority based service differentiation. We examine a number of parameters' setting in the IEEE 802. 11 e Enhanced Distribution Coordination Access (EDCA) that will meet military vehicular communication requirements for different types of messages. OPNET based simulation studies are conducted to compare the protocol performance for each priority in terms of average delay as well as the percentage of dropped data.

40|$|OBJECTIVE. The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to assess the patterns of patients who use a patient-physician e-mail service, measure physician time required to answer a patient question via e-mail compared with that via telephone, and determine the satisfaction of families who are provided e-mail access to their child's rheumatologist. METHODS. A consecutive series of patients' families were offered e-mail access during a 2 -year period. Data regarding patient e-mail use were collected, including <b>urgency</b> of <b>message,</b> subject matter, message volume, and time of day of messaging. The duration of the pediatric rheumatologist's e-mail interactions and telephone interactions with patients was measured using a stopwatch. After 1 year of enrollment in the patient-physician e-mail service, families were mailed a 12 -item satisfaction survey regarding their e-mail experience. RESULTS. A total of 306 of 328 families who were offered patient-physician e-mail access enrolled, and 121 used the service. The patients sent 40 % of their e-mails outside business hours. Messages that were urgent (notification of disease flare, notification of new symptoms, or parent expectation of same-day response) made up 5. 7 % of the e-mails sent to the physician. Messages that required emergent attention made up 0. 002 % of the e-mails to the physician. Answering patient questions by e-mail was 57 % faster than using the telephone for the physician. The physician received 1. 2 e-mails per day from patients. The families who responded to the survey agreed that patient-physician e-mail increased access to the physician and improved the quality of care. The families did not find that patient-physician e-mail distanced them from their child's doctor. CONCLUSIONS. Patient-physician e-mail is a service that patients will use given the opportunity. The e-mail service enables physicians to answer medical questions with less time spent compared with telephone messaging. In our experience in an academic pediatric subspecialty practice, patients reported enhanced communication and access with the e-mail service...|$|R
40|$|Mobile {{technologies}} {{offer the}} benefits of portability and ubiquity. However, their reliance on small visual displays and realistic settings (e. g. while on the move) can introduce a variety of usability challenges to users, causing situational-induced impairments and disabilities (SIIDs). While the sense of touch provides one solution to supporting users with SIIDs, the tactile feedback provided by current mobile technologies is relatively simple in nature, often based on the metaphorical associations arbitrarily dictated by interface designers. Furthermore, these cues are yet to be extensively evaluated outside of controlled environments. This dissertation aimed to address these limitations. Firstly, we studied the range of discernible tactile icons (tactons) that can be presented via standard mobile technologies. Findings highlighted the role of intensity in supporting tactile recognition {{as well as the}} impact of duration, interval and intensity on task time. We also examined the use of tactons in a mobile exertion application, designed to help individuals monitor and modify walking behavior. Usability tests of the application proved its utility in communicating alerts and promoting physical activity among users. Secondly, we examined the impact of situational distractors (i. e. sound and movement) on the perception of multi-parametered tactons. Results indicated the negative effects of these distractors on recognition accuracy, time taken and cognitive workload. However, some tactile designs (e. g. those encoded with stronger intensities) were found to be able to better resist such effects. Our findings highlighted the importance of evaluating mobile interfaces in more realistic contexts. Thirdly, we investigated the intuitiveness of tactile mappings between tactile parameters (e. g. intensity of vibrations) and message features (e. g. <b>urgency</b> of <b>messages)</b> for mobile notifications. A paired-comparison task was performed. Using this approach, we identified the tactile mappings rated with the highest preference scores. Tactons designed using these mappings were proved to be more effective in field-based settings. The dissertation has culminated in a set of design guidelines relating to the design and evaluation of tactons for use in mobile interactions. These guidelines may help the mobile interface developers to construct effective tactile feedback, and improve users' access to mobile technologies in distracting contexts...|$|R
40|$|In Asia, as {{elsewhere}} in the world, countries rushed to promote biofuels during the dramatic oil price increases of 2007 - 2008 {{as a way to}} enhance energy security, without waiting for the settlement of controversial debates about the environmental effects of biofuels, especially their effects on greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, biodiversity, and whether biofuels cause a conflict between food and fuel. This paper does not settle this debate, but instead argues that there are straightforward, practical and feasible measures that can be implemented immediately {{in order to reduce the}} pressure of biofuels on the environment and food supply, and more generally increase food production. The key is to focus on increasing resource use efficiency in agriculture, especially on different forms of energy use. Resource use efficiency in agriculture is low in many parts of Asia. Concrete measures that could be taken include reductions in market-distorting input subsidies and the introduction of resource-conserving technologies. These could be supplemented with greater use of non-fossil fuels in agricultural production, use of agricultural wastes in energy production, inclusion of input use levels in biofuel certification systems, and greater investment in agricultural research, extension systems, and infrastructure development. Biofuel fever has waned since the onset of the global financial crisis in late 2008, but it is likely to return when economic conditions eventually improve, and possible moves to strengthen the European Union biofuel blending requirements could further accelerate it. Much of the debate on biofuel-related impacts in the region has focused on deforestation, with little attention on agricultural input use, which could also have serious consequences for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In sum, this paper argues that governments can still improve the environmental performance of biofuels while reducing potential conflicts with food security by implementing the straightforward measures suggested here. Though these may appear to be basic textbook suggestions, many governments are still not following them even though the spread of biofuels increases their importance and <b>urgency.</b> The <b>message</b> is that the governments in the region should get back to the basics.

Little {{is known about}} the use of this approach to promote colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. We conducted in-person interviews with 438 insured adults ages 42 - 73 in Massachusetts, Hawaii, and Georgia. Participants were shown a sample message in which the sender shares that he has completed a colonoscopy and urges the recipient to discuss CRC screening with a doctor. We asked participants to edit the message to create one {{they would be willing to}} send to friends and family via email or postcard. Changes to the message were recorded. Edited text was analyzed for content and concordance with original message. The majority of participants (61. 6 %) modified the message; 14. 2 % added to or reframed the existing personalizing words (e. g. adding ‘because I love you’), 10. 3 % added <b>urgency</b> to the <b>message</b> (e. g. “please don’t delay”) and 8 % added reassurance (e. g. “It’s really not that bad. ”) Almost one in five (18. 3 %) deleted a negatively framed sentence on colon cancer risks. In 5. 7 % of cases, the meaning of at least one sentence was changed but only 2. 7 % created messages with factual inaccuracies.

40|$|That the {{writings}} of John Milton continue to provoke study and analysis centuries after his lifetime speaks no doubt to his literary greatness {{but also to the}} many ways in which his art both engaged and transcended the political and theological tensions of his age. In Dominion Undeserved, Eric B. Song offers a brilliant reading of Milton 2 ̆ 7 s major writings, finding in them a fundamental impasse that explains their creative power. According to Song, a divided view of creation governs Milton 2 ̆ 7 s related systems of cosmology, theology, art, and history. For Milton, any coherent entity a nation, a poem, or even the new world must be carved out of and guarded against an original unruliness. Despite being sanctioned by God, however, this agonistic mode of creation proves ineffective because it continues to manifest internal rifts that it can never fully overcome. This dilemma is especially pronounced in Milton s later writings, including Paradise Lost, where all forms of creativity must strive against the fact that chaos precedes order and that disruptive forces will continue to reemerge, seemingly without end. Song explores the many ways in which Milton transforms an intractable problem into the grounds for incisive commentary and politically charged artistry. This argument brings into focus topics ranging from Milton s recurring allusions to the Eastern Tartars, the way Milton engages with country house poetry and colonialist discourses in Paradise Lost, and the lasting relevance of Anglo-Irish affairs for his late writings. Song concludes with a new reading of Paradise Regained and Samson Agonistes in which he shows how Milton s integration of conflicting elements forms the heart of his literary archive and confers <b>urgency</b> upon his <b>message</b> even as it reaches its future readers. 2 ̆...|$|R
