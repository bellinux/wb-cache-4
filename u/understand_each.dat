5|$|Languages {{spoken in}} a series of dialects occupying {{adjacent}} territory form a dialect continuum or language complex, with some of the dialects being mutually intelligible while others are not. Adjacent dialects typically have relatively high degrees of mutual intelligibility, but the degree of mutual intelligibility between nonadjacent dialects varies considerably. In some cases speakers of nonadjacent dialects may not <b>understand</b> <b>each</b> other's speech.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{in their}} Philadelphia apartment, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Jim find their living styles are {{increasingly}} clashing. Jim is slovenly, leaving dirty dishes {{to soak in}} the sink until someone else washes them, while Darryl is so fastidious about his possessions that he puts labels with his name on all of them, even a bag of flour. When Darryl takes issue with Jim using his labeled coffee mug, the two begin bickering. Eventually the two come to <b>understand</b> <b>each</b> other's habits better, and relieve tension by playing a video game together.|$|E
5|$|The first, original, {{and truly}} natural {{boundaries}} of states are beyond doubt their internal boundaries. Those who {{speak the same}} language are joined to each other by a multitude of invisible bonds by nature herself, long before any human art begins; they <b>understand</b> <b>each</b> other and have the power of continuing to make themselves understood more and more clearly; they belong together and are by nature one and an inseparable whole.|$|E

60|$|No {{more words}} were needed: the two {{brothers}} <b>understood</b> <b>each</b> other perfectly.|$|R

5|$|While the game's cutscenes are {{animated}} with 3D graphics, {{the team}} recorded live-action videos {{to introduce the}} real-world skateboarding teams, so that players could better <b>understand</b> <b>each</b> team before selecting one to join. Neversoft interviewed professional skaters about their experiences of becoming known in the skateboarding world, then compiled elements of these stories into the game's script. Every skater who appears in the plot helped to craft their own scenes and voiced their own character.|$|E
5|$|Early {{concepts}} {{were very}} different from the final film. The initial version featured a floating castle with two brothers vying to inherit their father's kingdom, and when the brothers fell to Earth, they encountered a tall bird who helped them <b>understand</b> <b>each</b> other. Docter's next idea introduced many of the elements that eventually made their way into the film, but had Carl and Russell landing the house on a Soviet-era spy airship camouflaged as a giant cloud rather than on a tepui. This concept was rewritten due to its similarity to another idea Pixar was developing. Another idea Docter added, then removed, was magic fountain-of-youth eggs laid by the bird, in order to explain the age discrepancy between Muntz and Carl, but it was decided that this subplot was too distracting, and that people would forgive the minor inconsistency.|$|E
5|$|Central Atlas Tamazight {{is among}} the four most-spoken Berber {{languages}} (the other three being Kabyle, Shilha, and Riff), and rivals Shilha as the most-spoken Berber language in Morocco. Central Atlas Tamazight is mostly spoken in the entire Middle Atlas and its outcroppings, reaching east to Taza and west to the region near Rabat. It is also spoken in the central and eastern High Atlas mountains in Morocco. It is thus spoken across areas with widely varying ecological conditions — from the mountainous and forested regions of the Middle Atlas mountains to the oases of the northwestern Sahara (Tafilalt). Berber in Morocco is spread into three areas: Riff in the north, Central Atlas in the center, and Shilha in the south/southwest. Central Atlas is not mutually intelligible with the Riff language but is with the Shilha dialect; Shilha- and Riff-speakers also cannot <b>understand</b> <b>each</b> other, That said, the Riffian language is of course related to both Shilha and Atlas Tamazight, and even though Riffian {{and the other two}} are not mutually intelligible, they share a high degree of the same vocabulary and grammar.|$|E

60|$|Although they imperfectly <b>understood</b> <b>each</b> other's {{words the}} meaning was clear; the girl {{put her hand}} on his {{shoulder}} and looked frankly up in his face.|$|R
60|$|Sir Patrick {{waited patiently}} for Mr. Moy's reply. The Scotch lawyer and the English lawyer looked at <b>each</b> other--and <b>understood</b> <b>each</b> other. Mr. Moy {{answered}} for both.|$|R
25|$|Raichel {{expressed}} his view that real peace can come when people will <b>understand</b> <b>each</b> other culture {{and learn about}} it.|$|E
25|$|In 1888, the Vili of Gabon {{occupied}} Mayumba {{and exchanged}} with the Lumbu located along the Banio Lagoon. These two {{peoples of the}} Kongo group <b>understand</b> <b>each</b> other without an interpreter.|$|E
25|$|The {{people speak}} the Nuer {{language}} / Thoknath which {{belongs to the}} Nilo-Saharan language phylum. Though their geographical proximity with their Dinka's neighbors, the two people speak completely different languages and are unable to <b>understand</b> <b>each</b> other.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think we've <b>understood</b> <b>each</b> other exactly, Mr. Fulkerson," [...] said March, very haughtily. [...] "Perhaps {{we never}} can; but I'll leave {{you to think}} it out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it's what I mean. This is one {{of those}} things in which a man has to act on his own judgment. Your father and I <b>understood</b> <b>each</b> other." ...|$|R
5000|$|Community: Bounded emotionality {{is used in}} {{organizations}} to promote strong feelings of community between {{all members of the}} organization. Emotions are used to create a tighter-knit group that <b>understands</b> <b>each</b> other.|$|R
25|$|The Dalecarlian (Elfdalian) dialect {{group is}} highly divergent, even within itself, so that {{speakers}} of separate sub-dialects {{do not always}} <b>understand</b> <b>each</b> other. Dialects of this group are spoken in the northern parts of the province of Dalarna, especially in the Älvdalen Municipality, by a population of 1,500.|$|E
25|$|The {{details of}} these sacred events differ greatly from one text {{to another and}} often seem contradictory. Egyptian myths are {{primarily}} metaphorical, translating the essence and behavior of deities into terms that humans can <b>understand.</b> <b>Each</b> variant of a myth represents a different symbolic perspective, enriching the Egyptians' understanding of the gods and the world.|$|E
25|$|Conceptual metaphor {{theories}} {{argue against}} both subjective and objective conceptions of value and meaning, {{and focus on}} the relationships between body and other essential elements of human life. In effect, conceptual metaphor theories treat ethics as an ontology problem and the issue of how to work-out values as a negotiation of these metaphors, not the application of some abstraction or a strict standoff between parties who have no way to <b>understand</b> <b>each</b> other's views.|$|E
60|$|The negro {{appeared}} to ponder over his answer, {{for it was}} with difficulty they <b>understood</b> <b>each</b> other, though another man crouching in the wood smoke flung in a word or two.|$|R
60|$|The two men <b>understood</b> <b>each</b> other perfectly. He who had {{committed}} a crime, and he who {{was ready to}} bear its burden, both had done their share for the other's sake.|$|R
60|$|In {{answer to}} this Margaret {{would say that it}} didn't signify, and that it wasn't on that account; and I have no doubt but that the two women {{thoroughly}} <b>understood</b> <b>each</b> other.|$|R
25|$|As with Esperanto, {{there have}} been {{proposals}} for a flag of Interlingua; the proposal by Czech translator Karel Podrazil is recognized by multilingual sites. It consists of a white four-pointed star extending {{to the edges of}} the flag and dividing it into an upper blue and lower red half. The star is symbolic of the four cardinal directions, and the two halves symbolize Romance and non-Romance speakers of Interlingua who <b>understand</b> <b>each</b> other.|$|E
25|$|First, {{there is}} the {{communication}} between each member of a couple with their respective mate. Nancy tries to engage her husband, Charlie, in a mutually beneficial discussion about her needs and their future, but he derides her ideas. Nancy wants to explore and be adventurous in their retirement, while Charlie wants to rest and do nothing. Throughout the play, their inability to communicate and <b>understand</b> <b>each</b> other's wants and needs creates tension and hostility.|$|E
25|$|Faroese retains many {{similarities}} but {{is influenced}} by Danish, Norwegian, and Gaelic (Scottish and/or Irish). Although Swedish, Danish and the Norwegian languages have diverged the most, they still retain asymmetric mutual intelligibility. Speakers of modern Swedish, Norwegian and Danish can mostly <b>understand</b> <b>each</b> other without studying their neighboring languages, particularly if speaking slowly. The languages are also sufficiently similar in writing that they can mostly be understood across borders. This could be because these languages have been mutually affected by each other, as well as having a similar development influenced by Middle Low German.|$|E
5000|$|... “There was a {{time when}} all the people and all the animals <b>understood</b> <b>each</b> other and spoke the same language. ("Yanízį Denesųłiné chu tįch’adíe įłághe yati hot’a ʔełnedárení hél tth’i ʔełedárí tth’agh nisnį.") ...|$|R

25|$|A {{major feature}} of the tours is a 5- to 10-day mifgash (Hebrew for 'encounter') with Israeli peers, usually {{soldiers}} serving in the Israel Defense Forces, who join the tour. The stated purpose for the mifgash is for the participants and the soldiers {{to get to know}} each other and to better <b>understand</b> <b>each</b> other's world view and Jewish identity. Guided discussion sessions explore topics such as the Jewish tradition in the modern world, how Jewish life in Israel differs from Jewish life abroad, and how mandatory military service impacts young Israelis' perceptions of service and commitment to their country. More than 65,000 Israelis have participated in the program since 2000.|$|E
25|$|The {{three main}} {{languages}} all {{belong to the}} South Slavic language group and are thus similar, allowing most people from different areas to <b>understand</b> <b>each</b> other. Intellectuals were mostly acquainted with all three languages, while people of more modest means from SR Slovenia and SR Macedonia were provided {{an opportunity to learn}} the Serbo-Croatian language during the compulsory service in the federal military. Serbo-Croatian itself is made-up of three dialects, Shtokavian, Kajkavian, and Chakavian, with Shtokavian used as the standard official dialect of the language. Official Serbo-Croatian (Shtokavian), was divided into two similar variants, the Croatian (Western) variant and Serbian (Eastern) variant, with minor differences telling the two apart.|$|E
25|$|No formal Purchase, -- no tedious negotiations,...A firman insistently {{issued to}} Sir F. Maitland authorizing {{him to take}} & retain {{possession}} {{is all that is}} necessary, & the Squadron under his Command is quite competent to do both,...until an adequate naval and military force...could be sent out from the mother Country. When All this is accomplished, -- but not till then, a negotiation may be commenced in some such Terms as the following - You take my opium - I take your Islands in return - we are therefore Quits, --& thenceforth if you please let us live in friendly Communion and good fellowship. You cannot protect your Seaboard against Pirates & Buccaneers. I can - So let us <b>understand</b> <b>Each</b> other, & study to promote our mutual Interests.|$|E

50|$|Advantages of storgic love may be {{the level}} of how one loves their family and <b>understands</b> <b>each</b> other. In addition, two people that are deeply devoted to one another can feel the {{intimacy}} that they share.|$|R
30|$|The {{questionnaires}} were piloted (Kitchenham and Pfleeger 2002) and corrected {{based on the}} feedback. In the pilot, two Master’s students and one student from the course answered the questionnaires and thereafter described how they <b>understood</b> <b>each</b> question.|$|R
