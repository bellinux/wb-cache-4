5|$|Methods used to {{recreate}} the bog turtle's habitat include: controlled burns to limit the growth of overshadowing trees and <b>underbrush</b> (thus bringing the habitat back to early successional); grazing livestock such as cows and goats in the desired habitat area (creating pockets of water and freshly churned mud); and promoting beaver activity, including dam construction in and around wetlands.|$|E
5|$|On {{hearing the}} ambush in the distance, Dodge hurried on toward Fort Hamilton (present-day Wiota, Wisconsin) where he {{gathered}} together {{a company of}} 29 mounted volunteers and sped off to intercept the attackers. He led the chase through tangled <b>underbrush</b> until, breaking into prairie, his force {{caught sight of the}} raiding party. The Kickapoo crossed the Pecatonica River within sight of the pursuing militia, and entered into an overgrown swamp. The militia followed across the swollen river and dismounted when they reached the swamp.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus coexisted {{with fellow}} large theropods Ceratosaurus and Torvosaurus {{in both the}} United States and Portugal. The three appear to have had {{different}} ecological niches, based on anatomy {{and the location of}} fossils. Ceratosaurs and torvosaurs may have preferred to be active around waterways, and had lower, thinner bodies that would have given them an advantage in forest and <b>underbrush</b> terrains, whereas allosaurs were more compact, with longer legs, faster but less maneuverable, and seem to have preferred dry floodplains. Ceratosaurus, better known than Torvosaurus, differed noticeably from Allosaurus in functional anatomy by having a taller, narrower skull with large, broad teeth. Allosaurus was itself a potential food item to other carnivores, as illustrated by an Allosaurus pubic foot marked by the teeth of another theropod, probably Ceratosaurus or Torvosaurus. The location of the bone in the body (along the bottom margin of the torso and partially shielded by the legs), {{and the fact that it}} was among the most massive in the skeleton, indicates that the Allosaurus was being scavenged.|$|E
5|$|Hippeastrum {{species are}} {{concentrated}} in two centres of diversity, the main one in Eastern Brazil {{and the other in}} the central southern Andes of Peru, Bolivia and Argentina, on the eastern slopes and nearby foothills. Some species are found as far north as Mexico and the West Indies. The genus is thought to have originated in Brazil where at least 34 of the species have been found. Their habitat is mainly tropical and subtropical, though those species found south of the equator, or at sufficient altitude may be considered temperate. Hippeastrum is found {{in a wide range of}} habitats. Many are found in <b>underbrush,</b> while others prefer full sun. Hippeastrum angustifolium is an example of a species preferring flood areas, while other species prefer a drier habitat. There are also epiphytic species such as Hippeastrum aulicum, Hippeastrum calyptratum, Hippeastrum papilio and Hippeastrum arboricola, which require air circulation around their roots, which are in the subgenus Omphalissa.|$|E
5|$|The {{bog turtle}} is {{primarily}} diurnal, active {{during the day}} and sleeping at night. It wakes in the early morning, basks until fully warm, then begins its search for food. It is a seclusive species, making it challenging to observe in its natural habitat. During colder days, the bog turtle will spend much of its time in dense <b>underbrush,</b> underwater, or buried in mud. Such behavior is indicative of the bog turtle's ability to survive without oxygen. On warmer days, the bog turtle's activities include scavenging, mating (during early spring), and basking in sunlight, the last of which it spends {{a great deal of the}} day doing. However, the bog turtle usually takes shelter from the sun during the hottest part of the day. Occasionally, during times of extreme heat, the turtle will either estivate, or become subterranean, sometimes occupying networks of tunnels filled with water. At night, the bog turtle buries itself in soft tunnels.|$|E
5|$|The team {{tries to}} call for further assistance, but find the radio is no longer working. Randall heads outside to check the power transformers, and is {{attacked}} by a large creature (Ross Sturlin) hiding in the <b>underbrush</b> around the station. Randall fires a few shots at the creature with his pistol and escapes unscathed. Although {{he did not get}} a good look at the creature, he describes it to the rest of the team as similar in size to a bear. Later, the team finds the infirmary has been trashed and Corcoran's body is gone. They initially believe the creature has broken in and stole the corpse, but are shocked to instead find Corcoran has mysteriously regained consciousness. Upon checking his blood again, there is no trace of the mysterious cells from before, but after investigating Corcoran's body, they find the cells have changed into lizard-like fetuses and entered into his abdominal cavity. The creature later breaks into the lab again, this time beheading Dr. Wyman. Randall and Dunlap are initially suspicious that Corcoran was involved in the death, which he denies, but it appears he has some sort of telepathic connection with the creature. Despite Wyman's death, Corcoran does not believe the creature is evil, but rather simply misunderstood. He implores the others to give the creature a chance to explain its actions, and asks that they not condemn it as a monster simply because it is different.|$|E
25|$|Bosque aclarado, {{still with}} a {{predominance}} {{of the native}} species, but with abundant representation {{of a variety of}} species such as holly, maple, and ash. Frequently, leguminous plants predominate in the scrub of the <b>underbrush.</b>|$|E
25|$|As they spoke, firing {{began in}} the thicket {{in front of their}} position. Lt. Col. Huntington led most of his command forward. However, the thorny tangle of trees, <b>underbrush,</b> and cactus forced him to proceed with only one company.|$|E
25|$|Having {{divided the}} land into 100 acre block, the {{settlers}} set about clearing {{the land of}} its indigenous forest and turning it into farmland. Sawmillers milled larger trees, such as Totara, for building materials and burned off the remaining scrub and <b>underbrush.</b>|$|E
25|$|Before the {{founding}} of the city, the area was mostly prairie and open forest. Native Americans maintained this environment, good for hunting, by burning <b>underbrush.</b> Trees are mainly oak, maple, and hickory, similar to the forests of the nearby Ozarks; common understory trees include eastern redbud, serviceberry, and flowering dogwood. Riparian areas are forested with mainly American sycamore.|$|E
25|$|Over {{six months}} later, {{on the morning}} of October 24, P. V. Ward and J. F. McNief, while {{repairing}} a fence, discovered Booker's missing saxophone still in its black leather case. It was located in the <b>underbrush,</b> across Morris Lane and about 140 steps east from where the body was found. At the time of the discovery, the Phantom case was already considered closed.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 1863, most of the {{desirable}} lots at Woodland Cemetery {{had been}} sold. The cemetery sexton opened the northern half of the site in early 1864, and by April it had been cleared of <b>underbrush</b> {{and most of its}} roads and pathways laid out, graded, and graveled. The site lacked proper landscaping, however, and funds were sought from the city to permit the planting of sod, shrubs, and trees. A fence was built along Quincy Avenue in October of that year.|$|E
25|$|The night before, {{a terrific}} storm lashed {{the entire area}} badly. Prior to the battle, General Hill, seeing the rough terrain of the area as a hazard, had his men place a white cloth around their hats as a {{precaution}} {{to serve as a}} battle-badge. As it turned out, this was a great idea that may have aided immensely in the outcome... All were in dense marshy woods, or on the terribly muddy road wading through water two to three feet deep and through thick <b>underbrush.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lee {{interpreted}} {{these movements}} as {{a continuation of}} Grant's campaign strategy to move around the Confederate right flank and toward the southeast. He ordered Early's corps, which was entrenched across Warren's path, to attack the V corps {{with the assistance of}} Anderson's corps. Early planned to send the division of Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes on a flanking march along Old Church Road, turning north at Bethesda Church, and follow paths that his cavalry had precut through the <b>underbrush</b> to smash into Warren's rear areas.|$|E
25|$|A 2010 {{analysis}} of a local stalagmite revealed that Native Americans were burning forests to clear land as early as 100BC. Some regional late-prehistoric Eastern Woodland tribes were more involved in hunting and fishing, practicing the slash-and-burn Eastern Agricultural Complex gardening method, which used fire to clear out <b>underbrush</b> from certain area. Another group progressed to the more time-consuming, advanced companion crop fields method of gardening. Also continuing from ancient indigenous people of the state, they cultivated tobacco through to early historic times. It was used in numerous social and religious rituals.|$|E
25|$|After {{hearing the}} attack on Apple in the distance, Dodge {{continued}} on toward Fort Hamilton (present-day Wiota, Wisconsin), gathered a company of 29 mounted volunteers on arrival and sped off to intercept that band. He led the chase through tangled <b>underbrush</b> until, breaking into prairie, they {{caught sight of the}} raiding party. The Kickapoo crossed the Pecatonica River within sight of the pursuing militia, and entered into a swamp. The militia crossed the swollen river and dismounted when they reached the swamp and the Battle of Horseshoe Bend ensued.|$|E
25|$|On Labour Day (May, 1st) a {{colourful}} pageant is held {{throughout the}} village's high streets to celebrate lu Maje (The May), a circle-shaped wooden cane decked with small bunches of wild pink <b>underbrush</b> violets and other spring flowers and carried {{at the forefront}} of the pageant, which kicks off at the main church soon after the late morning mass. The flowers are then gifted to all families of the village during the door-to-door parade. A marching band plays along while food-and-drinks stalls are set out on the streets.|$|E
25|$|An {{incidental}} {{effect of}} pollarding in woodland is {{the encouragement of}} <b>underbrush</b> growth due to increased levels of light reaching the woodland floor. This can increase species diversity. However, in woodland where pollarding was once common but has now ceased, the opposite effect occurs, as the side and top shoots develop into trunk-sized branches. An example {{of this can be}} seen in Epping Forest in London/Essex, UK, the majority of which was pollarded until the late 19th century. Here, the light that reaches the woodland floor is extremely limited owing to the thick growth of the pollarded trees.|$|E
25|$|The thick <b>underbrush</b> {{prevented}} the Union Army from recognizing {{the proximity of}} the Confederates. Adding to the confusion, Meade received an erroneous report that the Confederate cavalry under J.E.B. Stuart was operating in his Army's rear, in the direction of Fredericksburg. He ordered the bulk of his cavalry to move east to deal with that perceived threat, leaving his army blind. But he assumed that the corps of Sedgwick, Warren, and Hancock could hold back any potential Confederate advance until the supply trains came up, at which time Grant could move forward to engage in a major battle with Lee, presumably at Mine Run.|$|E
25|$|Grant {{attempted}} {{to move quickly}} through the dense <b>underbrush</b> of the Wilderness of Spotsylvania, but Lee launched two of his corps on parallel roads to intercept him. On the morning of May 5, the Union V Corps under Maj. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren attacked the Confederate Second Corps, commanded by Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell, on the Orange Turnpike. That afternoon the Third Corps, commanded by Lt. Gen. A. P. Hill, encountered Brig. Gen. George W. Getty's division (VI Corps) and Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock's II Corps on the Orange Plank Road. Fighting until dark was fierce but inconclusive as both sides {{attempted to}} maneuver in the dense woods.|$|E
25|$|The fire regime before European {{settlement}} is poorly understood. Scholars {{know that the}} Lenape tribes burned the woods {{in the spring and}} fall to reduce <b>underbrush,</b> and improve plant yields and hunting conditions. The Pine Barrens, with its sandy soil, did not attract a permanent agriculture population (whose main interest would have been to establish permanent boundaries and clear the forests for fields). The area's sparse population encouraged a long-lasting attitude that forest fires should be set for local benefit—even on the lands of others. For instance, it was profitable for charcoal burners to set fires deliberately, {{in order to make the}} trees useless for any purpose other than charcoal making, then purchase the trees for a discount.|$|E
25|$|Winder's brigade {{crossed the}} river by 5 a.m. and {{deployed}} to attack east across the bottomland. Winder sent two regiments (2nd Virginia and 4th Virginia) {{into the woods}} to flank the Union line and assault the Coaling. When the main Confederate battle line advanced, it {{came under heavy fire}} from the Union artillery and was soon pinned down. Confederate batteries were brought forward onto the plain but were outgunned and forced to seek safer positions. Ewell's brigades were hurried forward to cross the river. Seeing the strength of the Union artillery at the Coaling, Jackson sent Richard Taylor's brigade (including the famed Louisiana Tigers) to the right into the woods to support the flanking column that was attempting to advance through the thick <b>underbrush.</b>|$|E
25|$|The band at {{the sugar}} camp was {{notified}} of the settlers' {{return to the}} cabins by a young warrior who had observed them arriving. While the settlers ate dinner, a group from the sugar camp quietly concealed themselves in the <b>underbrush</b> and approached Ament's cabin undetected. There were Potawatomi among the band, {{one of whom was}} a son to Chief Meommuse. The group has been named responsible for the May 21 Indian Creek massacre and the murder of a minister, Adam Payne, on the road to Ottawa. This particular group of Potawatomi was under the leadership of Mike Girty. As the men socialized after dinner, the Potawatomi waited in the brush, intending to attack the settlers as they left the cabin, but as they waited it began to rain. The band waited in the rain for many hours but the storm did not let up and they decided to abandon their plans for attack until the next morning.|$|E

25|$|At about 4:00p.m., {{the sounds}} of the attack at Appomattox Station had alerted Walker to the {{approach}} of the Union cavalry and he put Martin Gary's dismounted cavalry on his flanks, armed artillerymen out front as skirmishers and about two dozen of his guns arrayed in an arc on a rise facing the station. The area in which the Confederate artillery was located and over which the Union cavalry had to operate was cut through with wagon roads and overgrown with timber and <b>underbrush.</b> It was a poor location for either cavalry or artillery to fight in, especially after dark. In their haste to defend themselves, the Confederate artillerymen fired into their own men, killing or wounding several of them before the artillerymen realized their mistake. After the Union regiments came within striking distance of the Confederate camp, the makeshift Confederate infantry skirmishers fired on them. The Union men nonetheless proceeded with a poorly organized attack of about 400 men against the main Confederate artillery position and were driven back.|$|E
25|$|Grant began {{a general}} advance on May 30. Wright's corps {{was to move}} south against A.P. Hill on the Confederate left, while Hancock {{attacked}} across the creek against Breckinridge in the center, and Warren moved west toward Early along Shady Grove Road. Wright's advance became bogged down in the swampy land near Crump's Creek, delaying his VI Corps {{until late in the}} day. Hancock's skirmishers captured some of Breckinridge's rifle pits, but made little progress against the main Confederate line. Meade ordered Burnside's reserve corps to assist Hancock, but they arrived too late in the day to affect the battle. On the Union left, Warren moved the rest of his V Corps across the creek and began probing west. Lee ordered Early's corps, which was entrenched across Warren's path, to attack the V corps with the assistance of Anderson's corps. Early planned to send the division of Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes on a flanking march along Old Church Road, turning north at Bethesda Church, and following paths that his cavalry had precut through the <b>underbrush</b> to smash into Warren's rear areas.|$|E
25|$|As {{it turned}} out, the main Federal attack {{would come in}} Cleburne's direction. The 33rd Alabama, {{with the rest of}} Lowrey's brigade, was {{deployed}} to the right side of Cheatham Hill, facing two Federal divisions led by Jefferson C. Davis and John Newtonaround 8,000 men in all. Newton would attack the sector held by the 33rd, which lay across a shallow creek situated in a valley about twenty feet deep that gave way to sloping ground, all of which was densely forested and covered with thick <b>underbrush</b> that made a proper pre-attack reconnaissance impossible. Felled trees and sharpened stakes driven into the ground complicated the Federal attack, which kicked off with an artillery barrage around 8:00am on June 27. Though the Northerners managed to make some progress at first, ferocious fire from the 33rd and the rest of their compatriots drove the Federals back. Having lost 3,000 casualties to the Southerners' 1,000, Sherman finally called off the assault and left the field to his foes; a few days later he flanked Johnston once more, causing the Confederates to withdraw yet again and leading to Johnston's dismissal by Jefferson Davis on July 17.|$|E
25|$|The Union {{artillery}} fire was lifted as Meade's men moved forward around 1 p.m. Jackson's force of about 35,000 remained concealed on the wooded ridge to Meade's front. His formidable defensive line had an unforeseen flaw. In A.P. Hill's division's line, a triangular patch {{of the woods}} that extended beyond the railroad was swampy and covered with thick <b>underbrush</b> and the Confederates had left a 600-yard gap there between the brigades of Brig. Gens. James H. Lane and James J. Archer. Brig. Gen. Maxcy Gregg's brigade stood about a quarter mile behind the gap. Meade's 1st Brigade (Col. William Sinclair) entered the gap, climbed the railroad embankment, and turned right into the <b>underbrush,</b> striking Lane's brigade in the flank. Following immediately behind, his 3rd Brigade (Brig. Gen. Feger Jackson) turned left and hit Archer's flank. The 2nd Brigade (Col. Albert L. Magilton) came up in support and intermixed with the leading brigades. As the gap widened with pressure on the flanks, thousands of Meade's men {{reached the top of}} the ridge and ran into Gregg's brigade. Many of these Confederates had stacked arms while taking cover from Union artillery and were not expecting to be attacked at that moment, so were killed or captured unarmed. Gregg at first mistook the Union soldiers for fleeing Confederate troops and ordered his men not to fire on them. While he rode prominently in front of his lines, the partially deaf Gregg could not hear the approaching Federals or their bullets flying around him. In the confusion, a bullet struck his spine and fatally wounded him; he died two days later. Col. Daniel Hamilton of the 1st South Carolina assumed command, but Gregg's brigade was totally routed and was no longer an organized unit for the rest of the day. James Archer meanwhile was being pressed hard on his left flank and sent word for Gregg to reinforce him, unaware that he had been shot and his brigade had disintegrated. The 19th Georgia's flag was captured by the adjutant of the 7th Pennsylvania Reserves; it was the only Confederate regimental flag captured and retained by the Army of the Potomac in the battle. The Georgians broke and ran. The 14th Tennessee resisted the onslaught for a time before also breaking; a sizable number of its men were taken prisoner. Archer frantically sent messages to the rear, calling on John Brockenbrough and Edmund Atkinson's brigades for help. With ammunition on both sides running low, hand-to-hand fighting ensued with soldiers stabbing at each other with bayonets and using muskets as clubs. Most of the regimental officers on both sides went down as well; on the Confederate side, the 1st Tennessee went through three commanders in a matter of minutes. Meade's 15 regiments also lost most of their officers, although Meade himself survived the battle unscathed despite being exposed to heavy {{artillery fire}}.|$|E
25|$|By 6 p.m., {{darkness}} was falling, and Braxton Bragg had not abandoned {{his idea of}} pushing the Federal army to the south. He ordered Maj. Gen. Patrick Cleburne's division (Hill's corps) to join Polk on the army's right flank. This area of the battlefield had been quiet for several hours as the fighting moved progressively southward. George Thomas had been consolidating his lines, withdrawing slightly to the west to what he considered a superior defensive position. Richard Johnson's division and Absalom Baird's brigade were {{in the rear of}} Thomas's westward migration, covering the withdrawal. At sunset Cleburne launched an attack with three brigades in line—from left to right, Brig. Gens. James Deshler, Sterling Wood, and Lucius Polk. The attack degenerated into chaos in the limited visibility of twilight and smoke from burning <b>underbrush.</b> Some of Absalom Baird's men advanced to support Baldwin's Union brigade, but mistakenly fired at them and were subjected to return friendly fire. Baldwin was shot dead from his horse attempting to lead a counterattack. Deshler's brigade missed their objective entirely and Deshler was shot in the chest while examining ammunition boxes. Brig. Gen. Preston Smith led his brigade forward to support Deshler and mistakenly rode into the lines of Col. Joseph B. Dodge's brigade (Johnson's division), where he was shot down. By 9 p.m Cleburne's men retained possession of the Winfrey field and Johnson and Baird had been driven back inside Thomas's new defensive line.|$|E

500|$|The Leopold Report was {{the first}} {{concrete}} plan for managing park visitors and ecosystems under unified principles. With an infusion of scientists and resource programs, it set into motion a series of ecologically positive legislative actions in the 1960s and into the 1970s. While direct management of the elk population in Yellowstone National Park continues to spark debate amongst scientists, the report nonetheless successfully influenced multiple areas of park management. Prior to the report's publication, California's Sequoia National Park was beset by a thick <b>underbrush,</b> which the report directly {{referred to as a}} [...] "dog-hair thicket... a direct function of overprotection from natural ground fires". This <b>underbrush</b> would have been naturally eradicated by lightning storms, but because of policies that supported wildfire suppression, the growth threatened the park's Giant Sequoia trees.
