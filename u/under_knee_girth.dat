40|$|Objectives: The primary aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of a patellar strap on the proprioception of the symptomatic leg in PT. Secondary aims were to investigate a possible difference in effectiveness between athletes with high and low proprioceptive acuity, and whether predictors of effectiveness could be found. Design: Randomised cross-over pilot study. Methods: 24 athletes with PT (age 27. 3 +/- 9. 0, VISA-P 50. 6 +/- 11. 2) performed a joint position sense test with and without a patellar strap. The difference between both conditions was analysed using linear mixed-model analysis. Results: No improvement in the joint position sense using the strap for the whole group was found, while those classified as having low proprioceptive acuity did improve using the strap (p = 0. 015, 17. 2 %). A larger <b>knee</b> <b>girth,</b> longer duration of symptoms and more tendon abnormalities were negatively associated with the strap's effectiveness. Conclusions: The use of a patellar strap improves the knee joint proprioception - measured with joint position sense - of the symptomatic leg in athletes with poor proprioceptive acuity. Especially athletes with relatively small <b>knee</b> <b>girth,</b> short duration of symptoms and small tendon abnormalities might benefit from the strap. As proprioception plays an important role in motor control, and deficits in proprioception may put an athlete at risk for (re-) injury, these findings may be relevant for prevention as well as rehabilitation purposes in those PT athletes with low proprioceptive acuity...|$|R

The patient was evaluated at the initial encounter with goniometry, muscle strength testing, mid-patella <b>knee</b> <b>girth</b> measurement, the Numeric Pain Rating Scale, the 6 Minute Walk Test and the Lower Extremity Functional Scale, and a plan of care was established. Main goals for the patient were to demonstrate: active right knee flexion to 90 ??; a right straight leg raise without quadriceps lag; the ability to safely ambulate using axillary crutches maintaining non-weight-bearing status on the right lower extremity; and 100...|$|R

Reviewing the literature we found that proposed treatments for total talus dislocation varied from primary talectomy or arthodesis (to avoid complications) to closed reduction and an <b>under</b> <b>knee</b> cast. Most importantly, there was no agreement among authors about the method of reduction (open/closed). We report our experience with two cases of closed total talus dislocation not {{accompanied by a}} fracture, and review the literature to retrieve evidence on whether a closed or open treatment should be preferred {{for this type of}} injury...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Epidural {{anesthesia}} (EPA) {{has been}} performed in various oper-ations; however, it frequently induces postoperative voiding dysfunction. The frequency, duration and {{risk factors of}} voiding dysfunction occurring after EPA using long-acting anesthetics bupivacaine were evaluated. Materials and Methods: 100 patients, who underwent orthopedic surgery (<b>under</b> <b>knee,</b> operation time ≤ 3 hours) under EPA, between September, 2005 and September, 2006, were prospectively analyzed. Preoperatively, all patients urinated spontaneously, and had less than 100 ml of post-voided residuals (PVR). Postoperatively, the patients voiding patterns were checked and urine catheterization was done, unless the patient was able to urinate spontaneously or had less than 100 ml of PVR. Results: Of the 100 patients, 32 (group 1, 32 %) were able to urinate spontaneously and had less than 100 ml of PVR during the immediate postoperative period. However, the other 68 (group 2, 68 %) needed ca-theterization at least once. Between 2 groups, male, age over 50 years an...|$|R
