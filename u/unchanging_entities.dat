Like Parmenides, Plato argued that relying on sense perception can never lead to true knowledge, only opinion. Instead, Plato's more philosophical characters argue that nous must somehow perceive truth directly in the ways gods and daimons perceive. What our mind sees directly in order to really understand things must not be the constantly changing material things, but <b>unchanging</b> <b>entities</b> that exist in a different way, the so-called [...] "forms" [...] or [...] "ideas". However he knew that contemporary philosophers often argued (as in modern science) that nous and perception are just two aspects of one physical activity, and that perception {{is the source of}} knowledge and understanding (not the other way around).|$|E
5000|$|Hanh {{introduces}} the five aggregates {{as a method}} for realizing the interconnectedness and {{the changing nature of}} the self, as represented by the aggregates, and the outside world. Realizing interconnectedness and the changing nature of reality is a step toward liberation from the false view, which sees the world and the self as separate and <b>unchanging</b> <b>entities.</b> By realizing oneness with ourselves and the outside of ourselves, we experience liberation from the fear and anxiety of the discriminating view of the world, one that fractures reality into separate, unchanging units, brings. When we perceive the illusion of the isolated, unchanging self, we reach a level of wisdom the author calls [...] "non-discrimination mind". This state of seeing shows us that there is nothing out there to get, nothing to strive for, nothing to fear, as all these are an illusion springing from a fractured perception of reality. Reality is already perfect, unified, and our struggle is to see that truth, and be liberated from our chains of false perception that fractures everything into separate units. There is, in other words, no difference between the perceiver and the object being perceived; there is no separation between the self and the world.|$|E

I predict that dynamic networks and static networks produce different effects on behavioral commitment and on the psychological variables of trust, pleasure and interest. I test these hypotheses using a factorial experimental design. Support for the hypotheses is mixed, and examination of empirical results uncovers some unexpected findings with respect to the exchange behavior of actors in equal-power versus unequal-power networks. Actors in equal-power networks show indifference between potential exchange partners, while actors in unequal-power networks demonstrate unexpectedly high levels of behavioral commitment. Drawing on power-dependence theory, I also generate and test positionally-specific predictions for the psychological variables...|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} {{designed}} as a concise presentation of the way, in which the linguistic theory of sphoṭa, proposed by Bhartṛhari (5 th cent. CE), has influenced the idea of emotive suggestion (rasa dhvani) - {{one of the most}} prominent Indian aesthetic concepts, created by Ānandavardhana (9 th cent. CE). Firstly, the most important facets of Bhartṛhari’s theory are presented, beginning with the essence of relation between sphoṭa - a singular and <b>unchanging</b> <b>entity</b> capable of conveying meaning - and its audible, differentiated, and temporal manifestation - dhvani. Next step lies in describing the theory of Ānandavardhana, in which dhvani becomes a factor carrying the suggested meaning (vyañjanā) of a single word and of a whole utterance; and eventually - a factor that can also convey the emotive suggestion of a literary work as a whole.

40|$|The social-cognitive {{model of}} {{motivation}} states that students adopt {{a theory of}} the nature of intelligence that guides their goals in academia and their responses to academic setbacks. Students who believe intelligence is an <b>unchanging</b> <b>entity</b> within them are more likely to adopt goals to display high ability, hide low ability, and respond helplessly to failed schoolwork. Conversely, a student who believes intelligence is a measure of effort and persistence will be motivated to gather knowledge and acquire new skills. The current study investigated the role theories of intelligence play in the field of mathematics understanding. In two experiments, participants either taught themselves or were explicitly taught how to solve a novel math task. It was hypothesized that participants who believe intelligence is a malleable trait (i. e., based on effort) would engage more in teaching themselves the correct solution and experience fewer attitude-related cognitive disruptions during a test of the new math procedure. However, attitudes from the social-cognitive model of motivation were only found to influence behavior and test performance when analyses also included the influence of an effect similar to a stereotype threat among female participants. Although not all hypotheses and goals of the thesis were confirmed, results could help develop research that explains the cognitive mechanisms of mathematics anxiety and threats to stereotype within the field of mathematics cognition...|$|R

40|$|Taxonomic classifications {{simultaneously}} represent hypotheses of taxon {{identity and}} relationships to taxonomists, and real, <b>unchanging</b> <b>entities</b> to users of taxonomic information. Taxonomic changes, while representing scientific progress, {{can be a}} source of frustration for users. A method for assessing confidence in the taxonomy of a group of organisms would assist users of the taxonomy. A method is presented for determining the degree of development of a taxonomy, a concept termed ‘taxonomic resolution’. The method was applied to six groups of southern African mygalomorph trapdoor spiders, namely Stasimopus Simon 1892 (Ctenizidae Thorell 1877), Ancylotrypa Simon 1889 (Cyrtaucheniidae Simon 1889), four genera of Idiopidae Simon 1889 assessed as a single group, Galeosoma Purcell 1903, the families Migidae Simon 1889 and Microstigmatidae Roewer 1942, and the burrowing scorpion genus Opistophthalmus C. L. Koch 1837 (Scorpionidae Latreille 1802). The method was {{based on the assumption that}} species delimitation in a group of organisms, the taxonomy of which is based on morphological characters, depends on whether the sample of material examined is adequate for assessing variation in those characters. Five assessment criteria were identified and scored for a group of species using the taxonomic literature. Estimates of the number of species remaining to be discovered and described in each group were also included in the assessment. The results obtained for the trapdoor spiders ranged from 15 to 29 %, indicating a potentially significant degree of uncertainty in the taxonomy. Results for Migidae and Microstigmatidae were 51 and 78 % respectively, whereas the result for Opistophthalmus was 93 %. The applied value of a measure of taxonomic resolution, the limitations of the method, and a strategy for developing a more generally applicable method are discussed.

40|$|The {{theme of}} this {{dissertation}} is how changing claims {{as to what is}} proper and true social work have been formulated and staged in the twentieth century. From the perspective of cultural analysis I seek to discuss how social work has been formed and changed over a century. I wish to demonstrate how descriptions and narratives, actions and gazes, practice and rhetoric have constituted a changing professional role with differing expectations. It is a study of how different groups of social workers have made room for themselves and how new fields have been colonized. This process looks different depending on who has had the initiative and the primacy of interpretation. In the book I juxtapose the grand narrative of social policy with the stories of the young woman who wanted to combat destitution like some gallant knight; of the matron who served too much butter to her alcoholic inmates; of the teenage girl who was transformed by the official records into a sexual girl; of the fieldworkers who wanted to describe the concrete jungle in a new way; of the social medical officer who wished for civic common sense. The maxim is often the same: the modern project with its aspiration for order, or the good intentions with their unforeseen disciplining. Just as often, I have come across unexpected reasons why social work has taken the shape it has. In choosing a constructivist perspective I have tried to avoid regarding concepts such as therapy, client, or modern social welfare as stable, <b>unchanging</b> <b>entities.</b> By calling them constructions - formed and mutable - one cannot ignore that they are historically and socially constituted. It would be cynical to claim that social problems do not exist until a social worker names them as such. Men do abuse women, children are badly treated, and money is short - but this does not happen in a vacuum devoid of speech and action. They become realities in perception and conceptualization. How this is captured, described, and made into a reason for intervention is a central theme in the dissertation...|$|E
40|$|Users of {{psychedelic}} drugs often {{report that}} {{their sense of}} being a self or ‘I’ distinct {{from the rest of}} the world has diminished or altogether dissolved. Neuroscientific study of such ‘ego dissolution’ experiences offers a window onto the nature of self-awareness. We argue that ego dissolution is best explained by an account that explains self-awareness as resulting from the integrated functioning of hierarchical predictive models which posit the existence of a stable and <b>unchanging</b> <b>entity</b> to which representations are bound. Combining recent work on the ‘integrative self' and the phenomenon of self-binding with predictive processing principles yields an explanation of ego dissolution according to which self-representation is a useful Cartesian fiction: an ultimately false representation of a simple and enduring substance to which attributes are bound which serves to integrate and unify cognitive processing across levels and domains. The self-model is not a mere narrative posit, as some have suggested; it has a more robust and ubiquitous cognitive function than that. But this does not mean, as others have claimed, that the self-model has the right attributes to qualify as a self. It performs some of the right kinds of functions, but it is not the right kind of entity. Ego dissolution experiences reveal that the self-model plays an important binding function in cognitive processing, but the self does not exist...|$|R

It addresses questions of who creates mathematics, who uses it, and how. A broader understanding of mathematical practitioners naturally leads to a new appreciation of what counts as a historical source. Material and oral evidence isdrawn upon {{as well as an}} unusual array of textual sources. Further, the ways in which people have chosen to express themselves are as historically meaningful as the contents of the mathematics they have produced. Mathematics is not a fixed and <b>unchanging</b> <b>entity.</b> New questions, contexts, and applications all influence what counts as productive ways of thinking. Because {{the history of}} mathematics should interact constructively with other ways of studying the past, the contributors to this book come from a diverse range of intellectual backgrounds in anthropology, archaeology, art history, philosophy, and literature, as well as history of mathematics more traditionally understood. The thirty-six self-contained, multifaceted chapters, each written by a specialist, are arranged under three main headings: 'Geographies and Cultures', 'Peoples and Practices', and 'Interactions and Interpretations'. Together they deal with the mathematics of 5000 years, but without privileging the past three centuries, and an impressive range of periods and places with many points of cross-reference between chapters. The key mathematical cultures of North America, Europe, the Middle East, India, and China are all represented here as well as areas which are not often treated in mainstream history of mathematics, such as Russia, the Balkans, Vietnam, and South America. A vital reference for graduates and researchers in mathematics, historians of science, and general historians...|$|R

40|$|The present {{paper was}} planned for {{this issue of}} our journal, which Geoffrey Leech and I {{intended}} to devote to Politeness phenomena across cultures. It is based on his article titled “Politeness: Is there an East-West Divide?” (2005) which he suggested as a theoretical framework and includes results of our discussions held during our personal meetings and our epistolary exchange. Unfortunately {{the final version of}} the paper was never read by Geoffrey Leech for the reasons we all sadly know. Nevertheless I decided to publish it as a tribute to him in the knowledge that the result was not going to have the degree of excellence it would have had if he were still with us today. I therefore apologise for any mistakes or misinterpretations of his thoughts that might be found in the paper. The aim of this article is to sum up the main ideas of Politeness Theory presented earlier in Leech 1983, 2003, 2005, and other publications and discuss how that theory applies (or fails to apply) to other languages, with the main emphasis on the Russian language and culture. The term ‘maxim’ used in Principles of Pragmatics (Leech 1983) is avoided here as much as possible, as it implies some kind of moral imperative, rather than a pragmatic constraint. Instead, a single constraint, which comprehends all the maxims (the Maxims of Tact, Generosity, Approbation, Modesty, Agreement, Sympathy), and is called the Grand Strategy of Politeness (GSP), is used. The GSP says: In order to be polite, S expresses or implies meanings which place a high value on what pertains to O- his/her wants, qualities, obligation, opinion, feelings (O = other person[s], [mainly the addressee, i. e. H = hearer]) or place a low value on what pertains to S (S = self, speaker). The essential point is that these are not separate, independent constraints or maxims: they are instances of the operation of the GSP as ‘super-maxim’ which is an overarching framework for studying linguistic politeness phenomena in communication. The following hypothesis will be put forward, and supported by limited evidence: that the GSP provides a very general explanation for communicative politeness phenomena in Western languages such as English, Eastern languages such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean, and Slavonic languages such as Russian as well with a few examples from other languages. This is not to deny the importance of quantitative and qualitative differences in the settings of social parameters and linguistic parameters of linguistic politeness in such languages. A framework such as the GSP provides the parameters of variation within which such differences can be studied. We do not imply that ethnic cultures are homogeneous and <b>unchanging</b> <b>entities,</b> and do not disregard the fact that generalizations about any culture can be dangerous as things may be different in different sub-cultures or discourse systems within the same ethnic culture. Therefore we are speaking here in very general terms, as we believe that there is a common core which distinguishes one communicative culture from another. Further still there are some general characteristics of behaviour which can be observed in different cultures (1). Hence this article argues that, despite differences, each of the languages and cultures discussed herein constitute a more or less unified system in terms of politeness norms and strategies, and that the GSP can be used as a tertium comparationis to study politeness phenomenon across languages and cultures...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} uses of medieval and early-modern Iberian cultural objects in the present. It draws {{on the notion of}} fragment and actual fragmentary testimonies to study how pre-modern Iberian things and texts are reconstituted and used for various projects of personal, institutional, national and transnational reconstitution in the present. The corpus objects are necessarily diverse in chronological scope, with examples from the medieval, early-modern and modern periods, and touch upon works of many genres: chivalric romance, royal and personal correspondence, early-modern and modern historiography, Hispano-Arabic and Hispano-Hebrew lyric, inscriptions, pre-modern and modern biographies and 21 st century book exhibitions. The dissertation proposes that Iberian fragments are engaged in various forms of reconstitution or production in the present and, at the same time, are held as timeless, <b>unchanging</b> <b>entities</b> that have the capability to allow users to connect with something genuinely old, truly Spanish and, indeed, eternal. These methods of reconstitution include philology; the writing of history and attempts to understand the meaning of past time; the employment of fragments in debates about the origins of literature in Spain or, alternatively, pluralism and cultural sensitivity; and the collection of old books and the rare book market. To investigate the thesis regarding the existence of fragments between production and belief, I build on work on "presence" by Jean Luc Nancy, H. U. Gumbrecht, Eelco Runia, F. R. Ankersmit and others. Presence refers {{to the way in which}} the past is recalled or imagined in the present, or to the effects of present objects on observers and users. I compare the situation of the fragment with the status of the concept of presence. Specifically, the dissertation advances that the notions of presence as developed by the above authors reside between the pulls of production and metaphysics, as do fragments. The project presents four case studies, each studying one of the modes of reconstitution outlined above, a different motif of fragmentation and an element of the above tension in presence, which I call the "presence dialectic. " The first chapter posits philology as a means of reconstitution in working with highly fragmentary chivalric manuscripts to examine the impact of the fragments' physical presence on philological practice. The second chapter moves to two 16 th and 17 th century codices comprised of different "fragments" compiled by well-known bibliographers. It analyzes how early-modern scholars conceived of and brought together past times through the collection of documents, building a framework for characterizing the time of an old, physically present book. Chapters three and four shift away from fragmentary manuscripts or codices comprised of "fragments" to two very different forms of completion. The third chapter studies the "romance kharjas", two complete muwashahat and concepts of representation to examine the fragmentation of poetry by critics as a form of filling in the gaps of Iberian literary history. In analyzing the muwashahat as literature, the chapter investigates the opposition of representation to a less-situational, freer presence. The fourth chapter evinces the thesis of the presence dialectic by querying the meaning of the word "value" in the collection and sale of pre-modern Iberian material in the modern age. It draws on the rise of Hispanism in the United States through an analysis of the formation of the Boston Public Library and The Hispanic Society of America. The project works across medieval and early modern studies, philosophy of history and cultural studies to assess the reconstitution of pre-modern Iberian cultural objects in the present and their use for present-day projects of reconstitution. The dissertation looks both forwards and backwards, locating the activity of the modern medievalist as one that both historicizes and negotiates a use of the old material in the present. In doing so, the project intends to contribute usable philological studies on specific manuscripts, to further work on presence and to explore critically the meaning of the term "material culture. ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2005 The {{relationship}} between literature and nation-building {{has been one}} of the most crucial issues in postcolonial studies. The novel in particular is regarded as a means by which writers forge national consciousness among the colonized during the time of colonization. Many African writers themselves, for example, conceive of their work as an arena of resistance to European colonialism which disfigures the identities of Africans and denies their history. In this study, I investigate how Ngugi wa Thiong'o, the foremost Kenyan writer, attempts to construct what Benedict Anderson calls "imagined communities" in Kenya during the colonial era, decolonization, and the post-independence period as reflected in three of his novels: The River Between (1965), A Grain of Wheat (1967), and Petals of Blood (1977). Far from being an <b>unchanging</b> <b>entity,</b> nationalism is a social construct that is constantly redefined and historically contingent. In The River Between, Ngugi draws upon Gikuyu cultural practices, especially the contested and value-laden rite of female circumcision, as sources of collective identity on which Kenyans might build to construct a nation. As he moves toward A Grain of Wheat, he identifies Kenyan nationhood with the Mau Mau struggle against British rule. In this novel, Ngugi not only contests the British account of the national liberation movement as barbaric, criminal and tribal, but also critiques the government that urges the Kenyan to forget about the Mau Mau because of its violence. In Petals of Blood, Ngugi delegitimates the nation-state as it betrays the hope of the people in postindependence Kenya. Instead of materializing the ideals of the nationalist movement, the nation-state controlled by the elite and the national bourgeoisie fully embraces the ideology of capitalist neocolonialism which, like its cousin colonialism, exploits the marginalized peasants and working-class people. The clear-cut class divisions engendered by neocolonialism indicates that Ngugi's imagined "Kenya," a civil society that gives full value to its people, has not yet come into being, and the struggle of the masses for independence will continue...|$|R

However, when the territoriality {{of the state is}} debated by international relations theorists the discussion is overwhelmingly in terms of the persistence or obsolescence of the territorial state as an <b>unchanging</b> <b>entity</b> rather than in terms of its significance and meaning in different historical-geographical circumstances. Contemporary events call this approach into question. The end of the Cold War, the increased velocity and volatility of the world economy, and the emergence of political movements outside the framework of territorial states, suggest the need to consider the territoriality of states in historical context. Conventional thinking relies on three geographical assumptions (states as fixed units of sovereign space, the domestic foreign polarity, and states as &# 8220;containers&# 8221; of societies) that have led into the &# 8220;territorial trap&# 8221;...|$|R
500|$|In the Advaita Vedanta of the 8th century Indian philosopher Śaṅkara, the mind, {{body and}} world are all {{held to be}} the same <b>unchanging</b> eternal {{conscious}} <b>entity</b> called Brahman. Advaita, which means non-dualism, holds the view that all that exists is pure absolute consciousness. The fact that the world seems to be made up of changing entities is an illusion, or Maya. The only thing that exists is Brahman, which is described as Satchitananda (Being, consciousness and bliss). Advaita Vedanta is best described by a verse which states [...] "Brahman is alone True, and this world of plurality is an error; the individual self is not different from Brahman".|$|R

He managed to go through a kind of {{initiation}} or "forbidden threshold", but he did not change and stayed alive. Thus, the image of a boy is psychologically quite conditional. Why? The answer to this question is the purpose of this article, in which the novel "Oliver Twist" written by Ch. Dickens is considered and analyzed as an allegory of the God and the Devil, based on the study of archetypes of C. G. Jung. The novel of Ch. Dickens is inextricably linked with Christian symbolism, ancient view of the world. In order to consider it from this point of view it is necessary to rely on the ideas of C. G. Jung's archetypes that cause complex ideas to life, acting as mythological motifs. They are mediated by the consciousness of the author and are displayed in the form of conditional statements, in which the visual image is something "other. " The approach of Ch. Dickens to write this novel was inspired by Rousseau's concept of the original innocence of the child, as well as the romantic poets who gave the childhood the highest sacred value. Introducing Oliver Twist as a sacred, <b>unchanging</b> static <b>entity</b> in a severely fallen world, the writer conveys his image of God or the divine archetype of the child, as opposed to the archetype of the Devil embodied in Fagin...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} how the Cocopah maintain and express {{a sense of}} continuity with their past and how, in today's world, they use {{their understanding of the}} past to maintain their cultural identity in the present. An ethnohistorical reconstruction of Cocopah identity from the early period of contact explores {{the ways in which the}} political ecology of the Colorado River have influenced Cocopah identity. In approaching Cocopah identity from a political ecology perspective, it is argued that the federal bureaucracy's criteria for tribal status and the recognition of individuals as belonging to particular tribes are based on the commonly held notion of Indian tribes as being clearly distinguished, <b>unchanging</b> cultural <b>entities</b> occupying exclusively bounded tribal territories in stable ecosystems. Political ecology, in contrast, provides anthropology with a dynamic analytical framework in which to understand culture as adaptive systems. Political ecology provides a practical approach in which the interface between history and the dynamic complexities of diverse cultures within a local-global economic context can be examined. I add ethnicity theory to this political ecology framework in order to examine how these historical processes operate at the local level and how they affect Cocopah identity and cultural survival. The coping strategies that the Cocopahs applied to the ecological transformations of the lower Colorado River delta throughout the past 150 years have played a significant role in shaping present-day Cocopah identity. Recent economic development, provided by Indian gaming, has given the Cocopahs the opportunity to revitalize, redefine and perpetuate their cultural identity through the process of planning and developing a tribal museum and cultural center complex on the West Cocopah Reservation in southwestern Arizona...|$|R

The focus {{of the study is}} the interviews made with the inhabitants of a settlement area in İstanbul, Sarıyer, Rumelikavağı, called “Gypsy Quarter. ” This article will seek answers to the questions like what objective and subjectives dynamics are behind the identity formation processes of these people called Romans or Gypsies, how they define the patterns of social hierarchy which define them, how they manage to domesticate “their pains” and at what moments they fail in doing so. On the other hand, this articles examines whether the self-expression of the Gypsy identity in a heterogeneous public sphere can provide a potential space for Gypsies’ struggle against “the dominant national subject” and for healing their “pains”. This article will also try to show that multiculturalist policies risk falling into “cultural essentialism,” by accepting cultural identities as <b>unchanging,</b> clearly delienated <b>entities.</b> Before seeking answers to such questions, the article will shed ligh...|$|R

The {{functional}} languages we have studied so far, such as the λ-calculus and uML, have not had state, in the sense that once a value is created, it is impossible to change that value, and once a variable is bound it cannot be rebound to a new value (except by creating a new variable). Although state is not a necessary feature of a programming language (e. g. λ-calculus is Turing complete but does not have a notion of state), it is a feature of most languages in common use today. We distinguish between functional languages and imperative languages primarily on the basis of whether they are organized primarily around a stateless paradigm (with higher-order functions), or an stateful paradigm of mutable variables and data structures. It might be more useful, in fact, to distinguish between stateless and stateful languages, since stateful languages usually have functions too. Why do many programmers like stateful programming languages? Perhaps because it matches how we think of the world. We view the world as being composed of entities (such as people or objects) with intrinsic <b>unchanging</b> identities. These <b>entities</b> change their state over time while maintaining the same underlying identity. If a programming language matches our mental model of the world, it’s more comfortable for programmers to think about. Thus, stateful languages always come equipped with an underlying notion of identity, such as variabl...|$|R
