40|$|Chemical-Mechanical Planarization (CMP) is {{a crucial}} {{intermediate}} process in integrated circuit (IC) fabrication. As the average IC feature size decreases each year, scratches produced on wafers from polishing pads during CMP have become a prominent issue. These scratches can be much larger than features on the circuits, which results in an increase of damaged and discarded wafers after CMP. To determine the mechanisms of CMP pad scratching, an analytical model based in thermomechanics was constructed. This model accounted for potential sources of energy dissipation, which are important in properly understanding and accounting for processes which produce damage on the wafer. Multiple forms of energy dissipation were investigated through experimental analyses that include strain energies, energy flux through material removal, and internal energy dissipation. Mechanical characterization of CMP <b>pad</b> <b>material</b> and planarization experiments were performed. ^ Porous polyurethane polishing <b>pad</b> <b>material</b> was mechanically characterized in compression and in tension to properly model its constitutive behavior during CMP. Stress relaxation experiments of the <b>pad</b> <b>material</b> in compression were performed to construct a stress relaxation model. The results showed that viscoelastic strain energy is significant in CMP processes. Additionally, the polishing pad relaxation behavior varied {{depending on whether the}} pad was loaded in tension or compression. The viscoelastic relaxation rate of the <b>pad</b> <b>material</b> increased after being soaked in distilled water and CMP slurry. This result suggests pad scratching can be reduced with proper soaking of the <b>pad</b> <b>material.</b> Measurements of <b>pad</b> compressibility were also performed by optically tracking pad samples which were under compressive stresses. This analysis quantified the significance of the <b>pad</b> <b>material’s</b> compressibility with regard to its internal stresses. ^ Planarization experiments were performed to gather experimental information on mechanical and topographical changes of the <b>pad</b> and wafer <b>materials</b> through the CMP process. Generally, the coefficient of friction between the <b>pad</b> and wafer <b>material</b> decreased with increasing polishing time. From the constructed contact stress analysis, a smaller coefficient of friction resulted in the reduction of von Mises stress in the wafer material. The surface of a polishing pad became smoother with increasing polishing time. Experimental planarization results showed that roughness of the pad surface may have an influence on the coefficient of friction, while both of these variables relate to the scratching ability of the <b>pad</b> <b>material.</b> Plastic smoothing of the pad surface also indicated that the plastic strain energy dissipated into the <b>pad</b> <b>material</b> is important for the CMP thermomechanical model. ^ Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of worn <b>pad</b> <b>material</b> was conducted to observe potential energy dissipation into the pad’s polymer structure during planarization. Polishing pad calorimetry results showed a measurable increase in the computed enthalpies of reaction of pad samples with {{an increase in the number}} of wafers polished. These results suggest energy is dissipated into the <b>pad’s</b> <b>material</b> structure during CMP and may have an influence on scratch production. ...|$|R

The three different brake <b>pad</b> <b>materials</b> studied are flax fiber reinforced phenolic composites (FFRC), basalt fiber reinforced phenolic composites (BFRC), and flax/basalt reinforced hybrid phenolic composites (HFRC). A wear mechanism map was developed by using the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm method (FCM) to study the wear mechanism of composites. The results showed BFRC to be a better brake <b>pad</b> <b>material</b> than the other fiber reinforced composites studied, because the good thermal characteristics and bonding nature of basalt fiber increased the wear resistance of BFRC considerably.|$|R

The surface topography {{of the material}} is sufficiently smooth to probe the local nanomechanical properties with nanometre elastic deflections. Nanoscale loads were applied in the proximad direction on the distal joint region simulating the natural stimulus situation. The force curves obtained indicate {{the presence of a}} soft, liquid-like epicuticular layer (20 – 40  nm thick) above the <b>pad</b> <b>material,</b> which has much higher stiffness. The Young modulus of the <b>pad</b> <b>material</b> is close to 15  MPa at low frequencies, but increases rapidly with increasing frequencies approximately above 30  Hz to approximately 70  MPa at 112  Hz. The adhesive forces drop sharply by about 40 % in the same frequency range. The strong frequency dependence of the elastic modulus indicates the viscoelastic nature of the <b>pad</b> <b>material,</b> its glass transition temperature being close to room temperature (25 ± 2  °C) and, therefore, to its maximized energy absorption from low-frequency mechanical stimuli. These viscoelastic properties of the cuticular pad are suggested to be at least partly responsible for the high-pass characteristics of the vibration sensor's physiological properties demonstrated earlier...|$|R
