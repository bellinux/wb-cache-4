Hail up to 1 in (25mm) wide, wind gusts over 50mph (60km/h), and many reports of wind damage were reported in New York, Vermont, and Massachusetts before noon. Severe weather is an <b>unusual</b> <b>occurrence</b> in the morning, and the activity only increased in severity towards the middle of the afternoon.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{different}} receivers {{caught at}} least one pass, with Dexton Fields leading all receivers in the game with sevencatches for 101yards. Both totals were the highest marks recorded in the game by either team. Fields was also the recipient of a play that tied for the longest pass play of the game, a 37-yard toss from Reesing halfway through the third quarter. Cornerback and game MVP Aqib Talib came into the game as a receiver several times, but because his appearance in the game was such an <b>unusual</b> <b>occurrence,</b> the Virginia Tech defense was able {{to zero in on}} him and prevent him from catching the ball.|$|E
5|$|Indian cavalry {{participated in}} actions {{on both the}} Western and Palestinian fronts {{throughout}} the war. Members of the 1st and 2nd Indian Cavalry Divisions were active on the Western Front, including in the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line and at the Battle of Cambrai. A charge by the 5th (Mhow) Cavalry Brigade of the 1st Division ended successfully at the Battle of Cambrai despite being against a position fortified by barbed wire and machine guns.

5|$|The 2004 Pacific {{hurricane}} season was notable in that no tropical cyclone {{of at least}} tropical storm intensity moved ashore, an <b>unusual</b> <b>occurrence.</b> The season officially began on May15 in the eastern Pacific, and on June1 in the central Pacific; it officially ended in both basins on November30. These dates conventionally delimit the period during each year when a majority of tropical cyclones form. Activity throughout the year fell slightly below the long-term average, with 12 named storms, 6 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes. The season was reflected by an Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index of 71 units.|$|E
5|$|Bonnie {{continued}} to the west-northwest; late on August 9, the storm presented a 9-mile (15-km) wide eyewall, a very <b>unusual</b> <b>occurrence</b> {{in a small}} and weak tropical storm. Bonnie quickly strengthened while turning to the north, a directional shift caused by {{a break in the}} mid-level ridge. The storm briefly weakened late on August 10; it re-strengthened again the following day to attain a peak intensity of 65mph (100km/h). Soon after, strong southwesterly wind shear disrupted the storm, causing Bonnie to weaken again. On August 12, Bonnie made landfall just south of Apalachicola as a 45mph (75km/h) tropical storm. It quickly weakened to a tropical depression, and accelerated northeastward through the southeastern United States. After paralleling the Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina coastlines, Bonnie lost its tropical characteristics on August 14 to the east of New Jersey. Its remnant low continued northeastward, making landfall in Massachusetts and Maine and continuing into Atlantic Canada.|$|E
5|$|Late on August 29, Hurricane Edouard {{developed}} three concentric eyewalls, an <b>unusual</b> <b>occurrence</b> {{coinciding with}} an increase in strength to 140mph (220km/h). A mid-tropospheric trough turned the hurricane to the north to an area of unfavorable conditions, and Edouard weakened to a Category3 hurricanes on August 31. On September 1, the hurricane passed about midway between Bermuda and Cape Hatteras, and turned to the north-northeast. Edouard continued to weaken as it turned to the northeast, and on September 2 passed about 95mi (150km) to the southeast of Nantucket, Massachusetts as an 80mph (130km/h) hurricane, its closest point of approach to the United States. Edouard weakened to tropical storm status on September 3, and became extratropical shortly thereafter while located to the south of Nova Scotia. As an extratropical storm, Edouard turned to the east, then moved around the periphery of a larger extratropical storm until becoming absorbed by the storm early on September 7.|$|E

25|$|A rather <b>unusual</b> <b>occurrence</b> in Milan's artistic {{development}} was the reworking of the Piazzo del'Antico Verziere, the fruit market, which was centred around {{the construction of}} a fountain. It was completed in 1781 by the sculptor Giuseppe Franchi to a design by Piermarini with statues of mermaids and dolphins. Strangely, the square was never given a proper name, simply being called the Piazza Fontana (Fountain Square). The square was completed by the reconstruction of the facade of the Archbishop's Palace in 1784, again assigned to Piermarini. Keeping the old portal designed by Pellegrino Tibaldi, he simply added square windows, crowned with triangular tympani on the first floor, and added a new socle on the ground floor while creating a string course on the first floor.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} Lombard {{contingent}} had left Nicomedia, a separate force under William II of Nevers arrived at Constantinople.

He quickly marched out to meet the others, but in fact never caught up with them, although the two armies must have been {{close to each other}} on numerous occasions. William briefly besieged Iconium (Konya) but could not take it, and he was soon ambushed at Heraclea Cybistra by Kilij Arslan, who had just defeated the Lombards at Mersivan and was eager to stamp out these new armies as soon as possible. At Heraclea almost the entire contingent from Nevers was wiped out, except for the count himself and a few of his men.|$|E

25|$|A tour to England in 1983 saw New Zealand {{register}} {{their first}} ever test win on English soil, at Headingley. The match was remarkable for Hadlee's match return of 0 for 89, a very <b>unusual</b> <b>occurrence</b> in a New Zealand victory during his career. England eventually won the 4 test series 3–1; however, Hadlee topped both batting and bowling averages for New Zealand in the series, {{and took his}} 200th test wicket in the final test at Nottingham. In the return test series in New Zealand in 1984, New Zealand completed a remarkable three-day innings victory (including one day lost to rain) over England at Christchurch, in which England were dismissed for less than 100 in both of their innings. The match was also notable for Hadlee's superb all-round performance – he took 8 wickets in the match, and scored a rapid-fire 99 in New Zealand's only innings. These efforts led him to achieve the number 1 ranking in ICC Test Bowling Rankings for the year 1984 (he retained it for the next 4 years, till 1988).|$|E
