5|$|The {{classical}} formulae for {{the energy}} and momentum of electromagnetic radiation can be re-expressed in terms of photon events. For example, the pressure of electromagnetic radiation on an object derives from the transfer of photon momentum per unit time and <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> to that object, since pressure is force per <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> and force is the change in momentum per unit time.|$|E

5|$|The Northeastern Pacific is {{the second}} most active basin and has the highest number of storms per <b>unit</b> <b>area.</b> The {{hurricane}} season runs between May 15 and November 30 each year, and encompasses the vast majority of tropical cyclone activity in the region.

5|$|The {{luminosity}} {{of a star}} is {{the amount}} of light and other forms of radiant energy it radiates per unit of time. It has units of power. The luminosity of a star is determined by its radius and surface temperature. Many stars do not radiate uniformly across their entire surface. The rapidly rotating star Vega, for example, has a higher energy flux (power per <b>unit</b> <b>area)</b> at its poles than along its equator.|$|E
5|$|Impala are symbiotically {{related to}} oxpeckers, which feed on ticks from {{those parts of}} the antelope's body which the animal cannot access by itself (such as the ears, neck, eyelids, {{forehead}} and underbelly). The impala is the smallest ungulate with which oxpeckers are associated. In a study it was observed that oxpeckers selectively attended to impala despite the presence of other animals such as Coke's hartebeest, Grant's gazelle, Thompson's gazelle and topi. A possible explanation for this could be that because the impala inhabits woodlands (which can have a high density of ticks), the impala could have greater mass of ticks per <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> of the body surface. Another study showed that the oxpeckers prefer the ears over other parts of the body, probably because these parts show maximum tick infestation.|$|E

5|$|India ranks first {{worldwide}} in farm output. Agriculture and allied sectors like forestry, logging and fishing accounted for 18.6% of the GDP in 2005, employed 60% {{of the total}} workforce and despite a steady decline of its share in the GDP, is still the largest economic sector and {{plays a significant role}} in the overall socio-economic development of India. Yields per <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> of all crops have grown since 1950, due to the special emphasis placed on agriculture in the five-year plans and steady improvements in irrigation, technology, application of modern agricultural practices and provision of agricultural credit and subsidies since the green revolution.|$|E
5|$|The {{large amount}} of CO2 in the {{atmosphere}} together with water vapour and sulfur dioxide create a strong greenhouse effect, trapping solar energy and raising the surface temperature to around 740K (467°C), hotter than any other planet in the Solar System, even that of Mercury despite being located farther out from the Sun and receiving only 25% of the solar energy (per <b>unit</b> <b>area)</b> Mercury does. The average temperature on the surface is above the melting points of lead (600K, 327°C), tin (505K, 232°C), and zinc (693K, 420°C). The thick troposphere also makes the difference in temperature between {{the day and night}} side small, even though the slow retrograde rotation of the planet causes a single solar day to last 116.5 Earth days. The surface of Venus spends 58.3 days of darkness before the sun rises again behind the clouds.|$|E
5|$|Within the abyssal and hadal zones, {{the areas}} around {{submarine}} hydrothermal vents and cold seeps have {{by far the}} greatest biomass and biodiversity per <b>unit</b> <b>area.</b> Fueled by the chemicals dissolved in the vent fluids, these areas are often home to large and diverse communities of thermophilic, halophilic and other extremophilic prokaryotic microorganisms (such {{as those of the}} sulfide-oxidizing Beggiatoa genus), often arranged in large bacterial mats near cold seeps. In these locations, chemosynthetic archaea and bacteria typically form the base of the food chain. Although the process of chemosynthesis is entirely microbial, these chemosynthetic microorganisms often support vast ecosystems consisting of complex multicellular organisms through symbiosis. These communities are characterized by species such as vesicomyid clams, mytilid mussels, limpets, isopods, giant tube worms, soft corals, eelpouts, galatheid crabs, and alvinocarid shrimp. The deepest seep community discovered thus far is in the Japan Trench, at a depth of 7700meters.|$|E

50|$|Denervation {{processes}} have {{a strong}} association with the symptoms seen in post-polio syndrome. Those with post polio syndrome are undergoing a constant process of denervation and reinnervation. This process occurs after acute poliomyelitis and leads to increased motor <b>unit</b> <b>areas</b> over time. The motor <b>unit</b> <b>areas</b> soon increase {{to a point where}} reinnervation is no longer possible causing an uncompensated denervation of motor units which leads to muscle atrophy and loss of muscular strength. Following an acute polio infection diagnosis symptoms such as fatiguability, general weakness and pain are believed to be correlated to muscle denervation.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} slope-dependent {{variation}} in critical mean bed shear stress for coarse grain motion, and evaluates stream power per <b>unit</b> bed <b>area</b> {{as an alternative}} threshold parameter. Explanations for observed slope dependency and existing approaches for predicting the critical stream power per <b>unit</b> bed <b>area</b> are reviewed. An analysis of secondary bed-load transport datasets is {{used to examine the}} strength of associations between stream power per <b>unit</b> bed <b>area,</b> mean bed shear stress and mean velocity, with bedload transport rate. Data from an original flume study are combined with secondary data from similar flume experiments to investigate the effect of slope on both critical stream power per <b>unit</b> bed <b>area</b> and critical mean bed shear stress. Results suggest that stream power per <b>unit</b> bed <b>area</b> is most closely correlated with bed-load transport rate, and also that critical stream power per <b>unit</b> bed <b>area</b> is less variable with slope than critical mean bed shear stress. Alternative solutions to approximating critical stream power are explored. These include: (1) modifying existing expressions for critical stream power to account for higher critical mean bed shear stresses at higher slopes, and (2) applying a constant dimensionless critical stream power criterion...|$|R

40|$|Proceedings of the 1997 Georgia Water Resources Conference, March 20 - 22, 1997, Athens, Georgia. Standardized {{definitions}} of hydrologic <b>unit</b> <b>areas</b> are available nationwide and are broadly used in watershed studies; however, these hydrologic units are {{too large to}} serve many water-resource investigation and management needs. A standardized, digital data base of accurately and consistently defined hydrologic units is needed for smaller watershed areas. Criteria for selecting watersheds as hydrologic units, and methods of delineating hydrologic <b>unit</b> <b>areas</b> are being developed and documented. Hydrologic <b>unit</b> <b>areas</b> in Georgia are being delineated and digitized for watersheds at each of two size levels smaller than the existing hydrologic unit map.
