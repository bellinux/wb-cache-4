40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the behavioral impact of knowledge regarding the relationship between breast cancer, vitamin D supplementation, and sunlight exposure considering levels of self-efficacy and response-efficacy. The study was based on protection motivation theory, which attributes behavior change to cognitive processes related to perceived threats and has demonstrated efficacy in promoting breast cancer risk-reducing behaviors. The study employed a quasi-experimental research design based on a survey using SurveyMonkey. Participants were New York City-residing women ranging in age from 25 to 74 who were recruited via an invitation from SurveyMonkey. Correlation analysis and linear regression analysis were performed on the data extracted from the survey in order to better understand the relationship of the variables in this study, and to test if any of the independent variables were significant predictors of vitamin D intake <b>through</b> <b>supplementation</b> and sunlight exposure. The results of this analysis showed that knowledge regarding the reduction in risk of breast cancer from sunlight exposure and <b>through</b> vitamin D <b>supplementation</b> was not related to changes in behavior involving increases in sunlight exposure and vitamin D intake <b>through</b> <b>supplementation.</b> Further, the results showed that those participants with higher levels of self-efficacy and response-efficacy regarding sunlight exposure and vitamin D supplementation had an increased amounts of vitamin D intake <b>through</b> <b>supplementation</b> on a daily basis. The results of this study can be used to help medical professionals understand the complexity involved in how their clients may or may not take action to reduce the potential for reducing the risk of breast cancer...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Findings from {{epidemiological}} and observational {{studies have}} indicated that diets high in omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) may reduce the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). To determine if increasing intake of DHA and EPA <b>through</b> <b>supplementation</b> is beneficial to cognition and mood in individuals with cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND) or Alzheimer’s disease (AD) a four month, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study was conducted. Fifty-seven participants with CIND and nineteen with AD were randomised to receive either omega- 3 PUFAs (600 mg EPA and 625 mg DHA per day) or placebo (olive oil) over a four month period. Elevating depleted levels of EPA and DHA <b>through</b> <b>supplementation</b> in individuals with CIND or AD was found to have negligible beneficial effect on their cognition or mood. These findings confirm an overall negligible benefit of omega- 3 PUFA supplementation for those with cognitive impairment and dementia. More intervention studies need to be undertaken with longer study durations and larger sample sizes. It may prove fruitful to examin...|$|R
