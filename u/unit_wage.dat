Considered one of the special newspapers in Switzerland, WOZ focused on German-speaking residents as well as non-residents. In the beginning, its staff was paid a <b>unit</b> <b>wage,</b> but since 1984, WoZ was financially supported by Pro WoZ, a booster association. Beginning in 1995, the former WoZ and tax became joint editors of the German-language edition of Le Monde diplomatic as a supplement of the newspaper: its content was influenced by the conjuncture of various current events of the Swiss alternative political movement, in a first phase of the youth movement of the 1980s. The low proportion of advertisements granted a certain independence, but the newspaper was periodically under-funded. A financial reboot in 2003 ended in near bankruptcy due to increased costs, but a reorganization in 2005, which included the change of the whole first editorial board and the decision of not having a chief editor, ultimately allowed for consolidation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a structural {{vector autoregression model}} to explore the export dynamics in Turkey. Given the notable export performance after 2002, albeit high-rated real appreciation of Turkish lira, we investigate the role of unit wages in explaining the high export growth. We observe that, through historical decomposition of exports, real <b>unit</b> <b>wage,</b> not the real exchange rate, has been the main determinant of Turkish exports after 1999. Moreover, the impulse response analysis suggests that the short-term impact of a real <b>unit</b> <b>wage</b> shock on exports is larger {{compared to that of}} the real exchange rate. The same conclusion applies even for the long-run effects, provided that the confidence in the economy is maintained. We also demonstrate the importance of real unit wages by estimating an error-correction model, which provides consistent results with the impulse response analysis. The analysis points out that the real exchange rate is not the sole determinant of the export behavior in Turkey. The main point of the study is that, export growth can be sustained, even when the real exchange rate is appreciating, if the improvement in labor productivity can be sustained.

40|$|This article showcases ongoing {{work within}} ONS {{to develop a}} new unit labour costs {{indicator}} for the UK by building upon the existing <b>unit</b> <b>wage</b> costs series. It begins by examining the concept of <b>unit</b> <b>wage</b> costs, describing what the series aims to measure and explaining some of the conceptual difficulties when estimating data in practice. The first issue concerns the series used to measure the labour costs of employees; wages and salaries are currently used instead of the more comprehensive compensation of employees (CoE) series. Secondly, the labour costs of the self-employed are not satisfactorily estimated by the current method. Two possible methods {{for the development of a}} unit labour costs measure are outlined; both incorporate CoE as their employee labour costs measure, but take different approaches to estimating the labour costs of the self-employed. The article concludes that the preferred model for estimating unit labour costs proxies self-employed labour costs by applying the ratio of CoE to the sum of CoE and gross operating surplus in the employed sector to mixed income, a measure of total earnings in the selfemployed sector.

40|$|Austria {{currently}} takes 11 th {{place in}} an international ranking of unit labour costs. Labour is most expensive in Norway, Germany and Switzerland, where one hour of manufacturing labour costs almost a quarter more than in Austria. In Austrian manufacturing, one hour of work cost € 20. 31 in 2001, which was about 4 {{percent higher than the}} EU average. The amount was composed of wages costing € 10. 65 and non-wage labour costs of € 9. 66. With this, non-wage labour costs made up 90. 7 percent. In spite of a cut in the contribution by employers to the health insurance scheme for blue-colour workers, it was 0. 8 percentage points higher than in 2000, since severance payments, after declining substantially in 2000, were once again on the rise. Non-wage labour costs in Austria are high because {{a large portion of the}} annual income is in the form of tax-privileged bonus payments (13 th and 14 th monthly salaries). If these bonus payments were counted as fixed parts of the wage or salary, non-wage labour costs would make up 63. 2 percent for manufacturing. Austria's ranking in terms of unit labour costs changed several times over the course of the 1990 s. In the first half of the decade, Austrian industries lost ground due to considerable wage inflation and the schilling's upward revaluation due to the crisis in the European monetary system. After the mid- 1990 s, a better currency situation and lower wage inflation, with sustained high rates of productivity growth, markedly improved price competition: relative unit labour costs have since been declining on a uniform currency base against the average of trade partners, by well over 2. 5 percent p. a. Altogether, Austrian manufacturing has been able to improve its <b>unit</b> <b>wage</b> costs position by a good 10 percent since the early 1990 s. In 2001, the cost of an hour of work rose by 3. 5 percent; with productivity growth declining to + 1. 3 percent (as against + 7. 3 percent in 2000), <b>unit</b> <b>wage</b> costs in Austrian manufacturing went up by 2. 1 percent. With <b>unit</b> <b>wage</b> costs rising similarly in competing countries, Austria's relative ranking remained unchanged over the previous year.

40|$|In an {{international}} hierarchy of labour costs, Austria ranks 11 th, after Germany, Switzerland, the Scandinavian countries, Japan, the U. S. and the Netherlands. The labour factor is most expensive in Germany. At ATS 340 per hour of labour, German manufacturers {{pay more than}} a quarter over the Austrian rate. For Austrian manufacturers, a worker's hour costs ATS 270. 40 in 2000, or 2. 75 percent more than the EU average. Non-wage labour costs in manufacturing were 90. 2 percent in 2000, a drop of 0. 8 percentage points against 1999, due to lower severance payments. For the Austrian economy, its international position with regard to its unit labour cost fluctuated throughout the 1990 s. In {{the first half of the}} last decade, industries in Austria found their situation deteriorating substantially, fuelled by rocketing wage inflation and an appreciation of the schilling in the wake of the EMS crisis, whereas in the second half relative unit labour cost came down by 2. 7 percent p. a. compared to the average of Austria's trading partners and calculated in a single currency, the consequence of lower wage inflation, continuously high productivity growth (+ 5. 3 percent p. a.) and a better currency standing. Altogether, the relative <b>unit</b> <b>wage</b> cost position for Austrian manufacturers improved by well over 10 percent in the 1990 s. In 2000, <b>unit</b> <b>wage</b> costs declined by 6. 0 percent, considering that the hourly wage rate went up by 1. 9 percent and hourly productivity grew by 8. 4 percent.
