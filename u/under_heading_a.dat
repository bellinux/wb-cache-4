40|$|A short {{survey is}} given {{of the known}} facts {{regarding}} {{the relation between the}} constitution and the antimalarial activity of the chief cinchona alkaloids, and it is concluded that further information on this matter can be obtained in two ways: (1). By investigating the degradation products and some of the simpler derivatives of these alkaloids. (2). By preparing some synthetic substances which contain certain characteristic features. <b>Under</b> <b>heading</b> (2), <b>a</b> large number of compounds of the general formula: [equation] have been synthesised. These all bear, as the formula indicates, marked pictorial resemblance to the essential cinchona structure. The antimalarial activity of the new substances has been determined, and the conclusion is drawn that a second basic centre must be present for a molecule of the above type to possess any marked antimalarial activity. <b>Under</b> <b>heading</b> (2), <b>a</b> number of alkaloid methochlorides have been prepared by a new process, and considerable {{attention has been paid to}} the attempted decarboxylation of quitenine, since the decarboxy-lated product should exhibit definite antimalarial activity.
