25|$|In late October 2010, Sarah Palin {{announced}} on Fox News Channel that the Anchorage CBS-TV affiliate, KTVA, had been conspiring {{to make up}} stories about Miller and that the campaign had proof. It seemed that KTVA personnel had failed to hang <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>phone</b> after leaving a message for Miller's campaign spokesman and that their later comments were recorded on the spokesman's voicemail. During the conversation, they laughingly considered twittering about chaos at a Miller rally, and falsely reporting that sex offenders were there. The station's general manager initially took no action, saying the remarks were taken out of context, but he later fired two producers involved, and canceled two newscasts to hold a staff meeting discussing ethics in journalism.|$|E

2500|$|Marty's cleverness being downplayed {{during the}} Todd and Marty romance {{was also an}} issue. [...] "According to the FBI, rape is the most violent {{thing that can happen}} to a person — next to murder." [...] Despite Todd having a new face, it was stated that people who have {{experienced}} a violent attack can attest that their bodies may heal but do not forget. [...] "When encountered with similar circumstances your body immediately goes into fight or flight mode." [...] However, Marty spending time with Todd and hearing about the rape in his own words does not help restore her memory, aside from one subconscious flashback to her rape. In addition, Marty believes everything Todd tells her and disregards picking <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>phone</b> or Googling herself. On October 3, 2008, Marty finally looks up her rape on the Internet and sees the faces of her rapists, but Todd gets there before she can find out their names. Due to Todd's plastic surgery, Marty does not recognize that one of the rapists in the pictures is Todd. Todd is able to convince Marty to do no further research about her rape.|$|E
