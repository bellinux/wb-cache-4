The plaintiff, Stern, succeeded in showing probable success {{on the merits of}} its claim of copyright infringement and the court ruled they were entitled to injunctive relief. Both parties claimed common law trademark rights to the “Scramble” mark and moved to enjoin the other from using it. Omni had ordered and sold a small number of headboards (to be placed above the arcade game <b>unit)</b> <b>bearing</b> the mark in the months prior to Stern’s release of the game and, based upon that fact, made a first use in commerce claim. The court found that the defendants’ first use of the mark was not in good faith and solely in anticipation of later imitating the audiovisual display of Stern’s game, once Omni had developed their own “Scramble 2”. Further, continued use of the mark by both parties could result in consumer confusion and economic harm to both parties to the lawsuit. Based on Stern’s considerable investment in the development and marketing of the game and the large number of units already sold, the balance of hardships was determined to tip in Stern’s favor and Omni was preliminarily enjoined from use of the mark.|$|E
