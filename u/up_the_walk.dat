60|$|She peeped <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>walk</b> and saw {{her first}} fairy. He was a street boy fairy who was running <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>walk</b> closing the weeping trees. The way he did it was this: he pressed a spring in the trunks and they shut like umbrellas, deluging the little plants beneath with snow. 'O you naughty, naughty child!' Maimie cried indignantly, for she {{knew what it was}} to have a {{dripping}} umbrella about your ears.|$|E
60|$|One day, {{as he sat}} at {{the window}} fully dressed for the fourth of fifth time, William McTurg came <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>walk.</b>|$|E
60|$|This was the {{stronghold of}} the sophomores. As Ken sped <b>up</b> <b>the</b> gravel <b>walk</b> his pursuers split their throats.|$|R
5000|$|Thomas was {{approached}} by Warner Brothers to develop the show while he was editing {{the film version of}} Veronica Mars. At first he refused, but Warner Brothers was insistent, and he eventually took the job. Prior to iZombie, Thomas was attempting to pitch his own zombie television series; when AMC picked <b>up</b> <b>The</b> <b>Walking</b> Dead, it was [...] "so similar to what we were doing, it just killed that project," [...] according to Thomas.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Slinkton {{was holding}} his hat again, and he passed his hand <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{straight}} <b>walk,</b> as if he himself went up it serenely, after me.|$|R
6000|$|She peeped <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>walk</b> and saw {{her first}} fairy. He was a street boy fairy who was running <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>walk</b> closing the weeping trees. The way he did it was this, he pressed a spring in the trunk and they shut like umbrellas, deluging the little plants beneath with snow. [...] "Oh, you naughty, naughty child!" [...] Maimie cried indignantly, for she {{knew what it was}} to have a {{dripping}} umbrella about your ears.|$|E
60|$|Ludlow {{was only}} half-way <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>walk</b> {{from the street}} when the {{question}} met him, and he waited to reach the piazza steps before he answered.|$|E
6000|$|He hustled <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>walk</b> and blared at Carol, [...] "Where's {{that little}} fellow? I hear you've got one fine big he-boy that you're holding out on me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Sam {{climbed out}} of the cab, and holding <b>up</b> <b>the</b> counterpane <b>walked</b> across <b>the</b> yard in 'is bare feet to the stable. [...] "Well, will you drive me 'ome?" [...] he ses.|$|R
5000|$|A {{woman with}} a large pot picks <b>up</b> <b>the</b> plant and <b>walks</b> around.|$|R
6000|$|Her aunt followed. When Thomasin {{was going}} <b>up</b> <b>the</b> little <b>walk</b> from <b>the</b> {{door to the}} wicket-gate, Mrs. Yeobright looked reluctantly at her, and said, [...] "It is a shame {{to let you go}} alone." ...|$|R
60|$|This salutation was {{addressed}} to Mr Chuckster, who, with his hat extremely on one side, and his hair a long way beyond it, came swaggering <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>walk.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{looked forward}} to his {{entrance}} into the school with dread. All that Monday morning he stood about his door watching for Milton and seeing the merry students in procession <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>walk.</b> The girls seemed so bright and so beautiful, he wondered how the boys could walk beside them with such calm unconcern. Their laughter, their mutual greetings threw him into a profound self-pity and disgust. When he joined Milton and Shepard, and went <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>walk</b> under the bare-limbed maple trees, he shivered with fear. They all seemed perfectly at home, {{with the exception of}} himself.|$|E
6000|$|Edmund {{left the}} seat likewise. [...] "Now, Miss Crawford, {{if you will}} look <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>walk,</b> you will {{convince}} yourself that it cannot be half a mile long, or half half a mile." ...|$|E
60|$|She put {{his hand}} through her arm and marched him slowly <b>up</b> <b>the</b> garden <b>walk.</b> Before she had been five minutes in his company, she had resumed full {{possession}} of him in her own right.|$|R
6000|$|The Haydocks {{saw them}} laboring <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{slippery}} concrete <b>walk,</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> perilous front steps, {{and came to}} the door chanting: ...|$|R
50|$|The flypast route was <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Long <b>Walk</b> {{and over}} <b>the</b> Castle. The initial flypast over the castle was by nine Royal Air Force Typhoons flying in diamond formation. The main flypast over Home Park {{featured}} 78 current and historic aircraft.|$|R
60|$|He {{decided to}} part company with this chance {{acquaintance}} and, rising from his seat, strolled leisurely <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>walk.</b> A moment later, on looking back, {{he discovered that}} the old gentleman had disappeared.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear, be calm," [...] said Colonel Zane, in that quiet tone {{he always}} used during moments of excitement. He {{turned toward the}} bordermen, and helped Wetzel lead Jonathan <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>walk</b> into the yard.|$|E
60|$|The {{run in the}} motor-boat to {{the school}} dock did not take long. As soon as Nat's craft was {{properly}} housed, Dave and Gus assisted the money-lender's son <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>walk</b> and across the campus.|$|E
60|$|And Tom {{heard him}} keckling to himself <b>up</b> <b>the</b> garden <b>walk</b> to his house; {{went off to}} see that Elsley was safe; and then home, and slept like a top; no wonder, for {{he would have done}} so the night before his execution.|$|R
60|$|At {{last the}} sport slackens; for the sportsman is getting tired, and hungry also, {{to carry on}} the metaphor; for he has seen <b>the</b> postman come <b>up</b> <b>the</b> front <b>walk</b> {{a quarter of an hour}} since, and the letters have not been brought in yet.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, he was 7-11 for Frisco, {{and gave}} <b>up</b> <b>the</b> third-fewest <b>walks</b> per 9 innings in the Texas League, at 1.54. Bleier was voted Pitcher of the Week in the Class AA Texas League with the Rangers' Frisco RoughRiders on both May 10, 2010, and June 6, 2011.|$|R
6000|$|The painter {{turned to}} his servant, who stood {{blinking}} in the sunlight. [...] "Ask Mr. Gray to wait, Parker: I shall be in in a few moments." [...] The man bowed, and went <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>walk.</b>|$|E
6000|$|He gave me {{a guilty}} glance when he drew near the Bentley place and we saw a buggy {{standing}} at the gate. [...] "The doctor!" [...] he said, and he hurried me <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>walk</b> to the door.|$|E
60|$|Intuitively, {{the danger}} to the child flashed upon her, and with a shriek she dashed {{down the steps and}} <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>walk</b> toward the taxicab, into which Carl was now handing the baby to the swarthy one within.|$|E
6000|$|Katharine hung <b>up</b> <b>the</b> receiver. She <b>walked</b> <b>the</b> {{length of}} the room in such acute {{disappointment}} {{that she did not}} at first perceive Mary's absence. Then she called in a harsh and peremptory tone: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; but I was not <b>up</b> to <b>the</b> <b>walk</b> when I came here; {{and while}} you were ill I never durst go {{out of reach of}} the telegraph, and latterly I waited for you. After all, I have not much mind to it. I don't see the good of setting oneself a coveting one's neighbour's house.' ...|$|R
60|$|Everybody turned <b>up</b> for <b>the</b> <b>walk.</b> Food was packed, {{and they}} set off, a merry, delighted party. They {{hung over the}} wall of the mill-race, dropped paper in the water {{on one side of the}} tunnel and watched it shoot out on the other. They stood on the foot-bridge over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly.|$|R
60|$|It {{was about}} {{three o'clock in the}} {{afternoon}} and Hanscom's prisoners were dusty, tired, and sullen as they filed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>walk</b> toward the sheriff, who awaited their approach with an inquiring slant to his huge head. Mrs. Throop retreated to the house.|$|E
6000|$|The {{street was}} crowded with excited men and women as Kelley came back <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>walk.</b> One or two congratulated him on his escape from sudden death, but the {{majority}} resented him as [...] "the hired bouncer" [...] of the land-boomers in the town.|$|E
6000|$|Bertha {{was gone}} till nearly six o'clock, and her mood seemed no whit {{lightened}} {{as she entered}} the gate and came slowly <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>walk.</b> To Mart's humbly spoken query, [...] "What troubles ye, darlin'?" [...] she made no reply, but went at once to her room.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{alternate}} ending, after the mines are blown <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> townsfolk <b>walk</b> {{down a road}} to get help. They meet up with Pete and Harlan who were walking through the desert, Pete trying to convince Harlan the spiders were not aliens. Afterward, Sam and Chris kiss as the scene ends.|$|R
50|$|The two {{southern}} arms make <b>up</b> <b>the</b> popular <b>walk,</b> <b>the</b> Fairfield horseshoe, {{which starts}} in Ambleside {{and makes a}} circuit of the valley of Rydale to the south. On the western side, descending from Fairfield are Great Rigg, Heron Pike and Nab Scar while the eastern ridge bears the tops of Hart Crag, Dove Crag, High Pike and Low Pike.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait!" [...] she commanded, as {{they moved}} <b>up</b> <b>the</b> garden <b>walk.</b> [...] "I want {{to speak with you}} about Don Ippolito. What shall I do to him for my rudeness? You must tell me--you shall," [...] she said in a fierce whisper, {{gripping}} the arm which Ferris had given to help her <b>up</b> <b>the</b> landing-stairs. [...] "You are--older than I am!" ...|$|R
