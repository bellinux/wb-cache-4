5000|$|<b>Universal</b> <b>prevention</b> (aimed at a {{population}} that has no increased risk for developing a mental disorder, such as school programs or mass media campaigns) need very high numbers of people to show effect (sometimes known as the [...] "power" [...] problem). Approaches to overcome this are (1) focus on high-incidence groups (e.g. by targeting groups with high risk factors), (2) use multiple interventions to achieve greater, and thus more statistically valid, effects, (3) use cumulative meta-analyses of many trials, and (4) run very large trials.|$|E
50|$|An {{estimated}} 20-40% {{of youth}} have a psychiatric disorder, yet up to 80% {{of those in}} need do not receive mental health services. Preventing mental health problems and promoting healthy behavior among youth has become a critical policy issue. The Report of the Surgeon General’s Conference on Children’s Mental Health stated the importance of fostering a solid emotional foundation in children {{in order to facilitate}} learning. However, children and families face significant barriers to accessing and receiving community-based mental health services. As a result, schools have been identified as ideal avenues through which to reach youth. <b>Universal</b> <b>prevention</b> programs are offered to the general population, while selective prevention programs are intended for groups identified as at risk for developing a problem. This differentiates them from intervention or treatment programs, which are intended for individuals who already have a problem or meet criteria for a disorder.|$|E
30|$|While it is {{important}} to acknowledge that there is still a potential for stigmatization associated with <b>universal</b> <b>prevention</b> programs, these programs have an advantage over targeted programs in that their intended purpose may be less outwardly apparent. For example, in the below described <b>universal</b> <b>prevention</b> program, LARS&LISA, the trained skills are framed as helping the adolescents to reach their personal goals. As a result, students’ apprehensions related to the stigma associated with receiving mental health care can be quelled. Further, while the programs focus on reducing cognitive patterns and behaviors that {{contribute to the development of}} depression, it is not necessary for students to disclose information that would make them personally vulnerable to benefit from the program. Although there is still a potential for some students to feel marginalized in <b>universal</b> <b>prevention</b> programs, the risk is diminished.|$|E

30|$|When {{examining}} {{the effects of}} <b>universal</b> <b>prevention,</b> two issues that {{are different from the}} evaluation of therapy programs should be considered. First, as Pössel, Horn, and Hautzinger (2006) point out, while the lifetime incidence of subsyndromal and major depression are relatively high (Bertha & Balázs, 2013; Kessler, Petukhova, et al., 2012), the point prevalence of major depression in the general population is not high enough {{to examine the effects of}} a program by the prevention of diagnosable depression without an unrealistically high sample size. Thus, the main outcome variable in most, if not all, studies examining <b>universal</b> <b>prevention</b> is not the reduction of new cases of major depression, but the reduction or prevention of worsening of depressive symptoms. This leads to the second issue that is different in studies examining <b>universal</b> <b>prevention.</b> The majority of participants in studies examining <b>universal</b> <b>prevention</b> will show no or only very low levels of depression at baseline. Thus, contrary to therapy, which aims to reduce existing symptoms (therapy effect), the aim of <b>universal</b> <b>prevention</b> will often not be the reduction of symptoms, but the prevention of an increase of symptoms (prevention effect). Both issues should be kept in mind when reviewing the evidence to the different versions of LARS&LISA. To allow the readers to evaluate the strengths of the effects discussed below, we present effect sizes provided in the original articles. When the authors did not provide effect sizes, we calculated Hedge’s g based on the information provided in the original articles if possible.|$|E
40|$|Anxiety and {{depression}} {{are common in}} children and adolescents, and involve individual suffering, risk of future psychiatric problems, and high costs to society. However, {{only a limited number}} of children experiencing debilitating anxiety {{and depression}} are identified and receive professional help. One approach that could possibly reduce the prevalence of these conditions is universal school-based prevention aimed at reducing the impact of risk factors and strengthening protective factors involved in the development of anxiety and depression. The current thesis aimed to contribute to the literature on <b>universal</b> <b>prevention</b> of anxiety and depression in children. Study I involved a meta-analysis of earlier randomized, and cluster-randomized trials of <b>universal</b> <b>prevention</b> of anxiety and depression. Overall, the meta-analysis showed small but significant effects of universal preventive interventions, meaning that lower levels of anxiety and depression were evident after intervention completion and partially evident at follow-up assessments. No variables were found to significantly enhance the effects, however, there was a tendency for larger effects to be associated with mental health professionals delivering the interventions. In Study II, a widely adopted prevention program called Friends for Life was evaluated in a large school-based cluster-randomized effectiveness trial. The results showed no evidence of an intervention effect for the whole sample. However, children with elevated depressive symptoms at baseline and children with teachers who highly participated in supervision, seemed to benefit from the intervention in the short term. Study III involved a 3 -year follow-up of Study II and an examination of the effects of sample attrition. The results showed no long-term effects for the whole sample and no maintenance of the short-term subgroup effects observed in Study II. Finally, to increase our understanding of the development of anxiety in children and to assist future improvements of <b>universal</b> <b>prevention,</b> Study IV evaluated different trajectories of overall anxiety together with related patterns of disorder-specific symptoms in a school-based sample over 39 months. Evidence favored a model of three different developmental trajectories across age. One trajectory was characterized by increasing levels of overall anxiety, but fluctuating disorder-specific symptoms arguably related to the normal challenges of children’s developmental level, which warrants an increased focus on age-relevant challenges in <b>universal</b> <b>prevention.</b> The four studies provide further understanding of the overall effectiveness of <b>universal</b> <b>prevention</b> of anxiety and depression in children, the short- and long-term effects of <b>universal</b> <b>prevention</b> in a Swedish context, and ideas for further development of preventive interventions. ...|$|E
30|$|Another {{advantage}} of <b>universal</b> <b>prevention</b> programs {{is that the}} inclusion of all individuals in a particular group makes it likely that some group members already have the skills that the program focuses on. These group members can serve as peer role models for the members who would benefit from improving such skills (Harrington & Clark, 1998; Lowry-Webster, Barrett, & Dadds, 2001). Further, by participating in <b>universal</b> <b>prevention</b> programs, even individuals who are not at risk of developing the targeted problem benefit from the skills trained in these programs (Harrington & Clark, 1998). Building on this argument, Offord (2000) argued that while the effects of targeted programs are bigger on individual participants, universal programs can still have enormous effects on a system (e.g., a school or society) as they have (smaller) effects on a significantly larger number of individuals.|$|E

Hierarchical linear modeling was used to analyze results from assess-ments in the fall and spring of 2 consecutive school years. In Year 1, significant gains in teacher-rated social competence for students in Grades K– 2, in child self-reported peace-building behavior in Grades K– 5, and reductions in aggressive behavior in Grades 3 – 5 were found for PBI but not PBD schools.

40|$|Background. The {{prevention}} of depression {{is a key}} public health policy priority. PredictD is the first risk algorithm for the prediction of the onset of major depression. Our aim {{in this study was}} to model the cost-effectiveness of PredictD in depression prevention in general practice (GP). Method. A decision analytical model was developed to determine the cost-effectiveness of two approaches, each of which was compared to treatment as usual (TAU) over 12 months: (1) the PredictD risk algorithm plus a low-intensity depression prevention programme; and (2) a <b>universal</b> <b>prevention</b> programme in which there was no initial identification of those at risk. The model simulates the incidence of depression and disease progression over 12 months and calculates the net monetary benefit (NMB) from the National Health Service (NHS) perspective. Results. Providing patients with PredictD and a depression prevention programme prevented 15 (17 %) cases of depression in a cohort of 1000 patients over 12 months and had the highest probability of being the optimal choice at a willingness to pay (WTP) of £ 20000 for a quality-adjusted life year (QALY). <b>Universal</b> <b>prevention</b> was strongly dominated by PredictD plus a depression prevention programme in that <b>universal</b> <b>prevention</b> resulted in less QALYs than PredictD plus prevention for a greater cost.

30|$|Based on the {{evidence}} and considerations outlined above, effective programs that ameliorate currently existing depressive symptoms and prevent normative increases in depressive symptoms are needed (e.g., Horowitz & Garber, 2006). Prevention programs can be differentiated based on the target group they are designed for and are usually separated into three categories: indicated, selective, and universal. Indicated prevention programs {{are designed to help}} individuals with clear risk factors. Selective prevention programs are aimed at subpopulations known to be at increased risk for developing certain problems. These two types of prevention programs are often collectively categorized as targeted prevention. Finally, <b>universal</b> <b>prevention</b> is intended for all individuals, regardless of their risk for developing a problem. Each type of prevention has advantages and disadvantages, which are discussed in detail by Offord (2000) and Pössel, Schneider, and Seemann (2006). Offord lists many advantages (n[*]=[*] 6) and disadvantages (n[*]=[*] 8) for <b>universal</b> <b>prevention</b> but only two advantages and six disadvantages for targeted programs.

40|$|Background and objective: Mental health {{problems}} are {{a public health}} issue affecting as many as 20 % of children in modern communities. Risk factors for externalising and internalising problems can occur in infancy. Infants at high risk live in stressed families with parent mental {{health problems}}, substance misuse, relationship conflict, social isolation, financial problems or infant temperamental difficulty. Although current prevention programmes target services to high-risk groups, targeting can stigmatise families and miss many children in need. The addition of <b>universal</b> <b>prevention</b> programmes for all families could address these concerns. This survey assessed the prevalence of infants at risk attending a primary care service as a delivery point for <b>universal</b> <b>prevention.</b> Design: Survey of mothers of 6 -month-old infants attending well-child clinics across six government areas of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, between August and September 2004. A brief survey measured sociodemographic characteristics and the following family risks: maternal depression, anxiety, stress, substance misuse, violence at home, social isolation and infant temperamental difficulty. Results: The survey was completed by 733 mothers, representing 69 % of infant births presented to the primary care service. Of these, 39 % of infants were classified as at risk for developing mental health problems. The percentage of infants classified as at risk was not markedly dissimilar across socioeconomi...|$|E
