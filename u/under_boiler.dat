But the availability of fine aggregate becomes difficult day by day. Hence the need arises to find alternative for the fine aggregate. The material which is known as bottom ash is available ash waste by-product material from the thermal power plants. In India most of the thermal power plants use wet system for disposal of ash.

In this study, morpholine (hydro) thermolysis is simulated at boiler (352 degrees C, 17. 5 MPa) and superheater (490 degrees C, 17. 5 MPa) conditions with an experimental stainless steel flow reactor. Thermolysis under superheater conditions was more rapid than hydrothermolysis <b>under</b> <b>boiler</b> conditions. Organic acid anion decomposition products increased linearly over time, while the thermal decomposition of morpholine followed first order kinetics. Further experiments under superheater conditions were performed at 470, 490 and 510 degrees C, with pressures of 9. 5, 13. 5, and 17. 5 MPa. With the kinetic rate constants for morpholine thermolysis in dry steam derived empirically, the activation energy of the decomposition reaction was 160. 0 (+/- 2. 0) kJ/mol, the pre-exponential factor was e(21. 7 (+/- 0. 66)) s(- 1), and the activation volume was 896 (+/- 36) cm(3) /mol. This led to a model capable of predicting the observed pressure and temperature dependent thermolysis of morpholine under the investigated conditions. Care must be taken when using the model results to calculate morpholine stability in the SWC, because wall effects during (hydro) thermolysis require further investigation...|$|E

40|$|Low {{concentrations}} of sodium phosphate {{are added to}} the boiler water of electric power stations as a means of controlling pH. Hideout is the phenomenon by which sodium phosphate is observed to be retained in the boiler during conditions of high temperature and pressure, only to be released back into the water upon cooling. All-volatile amine treatment is an alternative boiler water pH control method, without the same adverse effects, but it is not known if problems will arise from a changeover from congruent phosphate control to all-volatile treatment. The objective of this research was (i) to develop improved synthetic methods for the known hideout reaction products, maricite, NaFeᴵᴵPO₄, and sodium iron hydroxyl phosphate (SIHP), Na₃Feᴵᴵᴵ (PO₄) ₂•(Na₄/₃H₂/₃O), (ii) identify any ammonium-iron-phosphate reaction products that may form during the changeover, and (iii) measure the solubility of the hideout reaction product sodium-nickel-hydroxyl-phosphate (SNHP), Na₂Ni(OH) PO₄, so that a thermodynamic database can be derived. [...] The syntheses of the solid reaction products were carried out in 45 mL Parr 4744 Teflon-lined stainless steel reaction vessels which allowed in situ filtration of the products fi-om solution by inversion of the vessel, allowing the remaining solution to drain through a stainless steel mesh. Maricite was synthesized using previous established methods, whereas new methods for synthesizing SIHP from thermal decomposition of iron(III) nitrilotriacetic acid, and chelates, iron oxalate and iron tartrate, have been developed. A new hydrothermal synthesis for (NH₄) FeᴵᴵFeᴵᴵᴵ (PO₄) ₂ has been developed by thermally decomposing the chelate, iron tartrate. An additional ammonium reaction product, (NH₄) Feᴵᴵ(PO₄) •H₂O, was synthesized from the iron nitrilotriacetic acid complex. This provided a new synthetic route for this compound and proved that it formed <b>under</b> <b>boiler</b> conditions. The crystal structure of (NH₄) FeᴵᴵPO₄) •H₂O was also confirmed. The major sodium-nickel-phosphate reaction product Na₂Ni(OH) PO₄, was synthesized by two separate methods, fi-om nickel oxide and from the thermal decomposition of the nickel nitrilotriacetic acid complex. [...] Solubility studies of Na₂Ni(OH) PO₄, SNHP, were carried out in a modified 450 mL Parr 4562 stirred zirconium reaction vessel, according to the following reaction: [...] NiO(s) + 2 Na⁺(aq) + HPO₄²⁻ (aq) ⇋ Na₂Ni(OH) PO₄(s) [...] Kinetic experiments were conducted at 250 °C to ensure equilibrium had been reached and solubility data were collected over the temperature range 235 - 280 °C at a sodium/phosphate mole ratio of 2. 5 that had an initial phosphate concentration of 1. 5 mol•kg⁻¹. The MULTEQ chemical equilibrium program was used to calculate the composition {{concentrations of}} relevant species at each temperature studied, and experimental equilibrium constants were calculated from the activity coefficient model used in MULTEQ. The results were used to create a thermodynamic model for SNHP, consistent with the Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers model for the standard partial molar properties of aqueous phosphate species. [...] In conclusion, the maricite synthesis reported by Quinlan (1996) was reproducible and SIHP was synthesized from similar conditions as the maricite synthesis and using the analogous chelate decomposition reaction. Ammonium-iron-phosphate reaction products can form <b>under</b> <b>boiler</b> conditions; those identified in this study were (NH₄) FeᴵᴵFeᴵᴵᴵ (PO₄) ₂ and (NH₄) Feᴵᴵ(PO₄) •H₂O. The major sodium-nickel-phosphate reaction product synthesized was Na₂Ni(OH) PO₄ and the data from this study and that previously reported for this reaction product, were used to create a thermodynamic model for this system, consistent with the database for sodium-iron hideout reactions. ...|$|E
40|$|Boiler {{feedwater}} {{and steam}} {{have to be}} of high purity, because of the susceptibility of the steam-water cycle to corrosion. Organic contaminants break down in boilers by hydrothermolysis, leading {{to the formation of}} organic acid anions, which are suspected to cause corrosion of steam-water cycle components. The impact and behavior of organic decomposition products in the steam-water cycle are not well understood. While guidelines for organic contaminants are becoming stricter, organic treatment chemicals are gaining popularity. Some alkalizing amines show potential for protecting steam-water cycles against corrosion, but their thermal stability is limited and acidic decomposition products are a concern. There are no official guidelines for the application of alkalizing amines in fossil-fired plants, because their thermal stability in the hottest sections of the plant is unknown. This thesis aims to contribute to well-founded guidelines for organic contamination and amine application in steam-water cycles to facilitate effective water treatment and chemical dosing. It does so by investigating the thermal decomposition of organic contaminants and treatment chemicals and using results to conduct corrosion experiments. To investigate hydrothermal reactions both batch and continuous flow reactors were tested, and it was concluded that the latter are better at investigating (hydro) thermolysis of organic treatment chemicals. A flow reactor gives precise control over retention time, temperature and pressure and these parameters can be changed much faster than with a batch reactor. The flow reactor was the basis for virtually all thermal stability and decomposition experiments described in this thesis. It was found that lower heating rates give more organic acid anions as degradation products of organic carbon, both in quantity and species variety. Thermal stability of the decomposition products determines which of these products is most prevalent. As boiler temperature increased, acetate became the dominant degradation product, due to its higher thermal stability. Shorter retention times led to more variety and quantity of organic acid anions, {{due to a lack of}} time for the thermally less stable ones to degrade. The absence of oxygen increased the thermal stability of decomposition products. The (hydro) thermolysis of monoethylene glycol and slurry oil produced up to a few hundred ppb acetate and formate. The (hydro) thermolysis of polyethylene glycol produced a high variety and quantity of organic acid anions, that could only partially be determined to be in the lower ppm range. The (hydro) thermolysis of the water dissolvable fraction of gasoil, naphtha and hydro wax did not lead to an increase in organic acid anions. Methyl ethyl ketoxime thermally degraded into several organic acid anions and nitrite in the higher ppb or lower ppm range. By using the flow reactor to investigate amine thermal stability, it was concluded that thermolysis under superheater conditions was more rapid than hydrothermolysis <b>under</b> <b>boiler</b> conditions. Anionic decomposition products increased linearly over time, while the thermal decomposition of morpholine followed first order kinetics. Metal catalysis of amine thermolysis caused by oxides on the inner surface of superheater tubes was investigated by using varying sizes and elemental composition. Kinetics of morpholine and ethanolamine thermolysis decreased as the tube size increased. The relation between the surface:volume ratio and the degradation rate constant was linear. Although results varied between the two applied tubing materials, there is no consistent trend that can link thermolysis kinetics to tube wall composition. The thermolysis of five alkalizing amines and two organic acids was comprehensively tested at superheater conditions. Morpholine, ethanolamine, cyclohexylamine, dimethylamine, 3 -methoxypropylamine and acetic acid were shown to undergo thermolysis according to first order kinetics. The activation energy, prefactor and activation volume were obtained from the experimental data for all investigated amines. Dimethylamine did not fully degrade, in spite of longer retention times being applied, suggesting synthesis may occur. Formic acid is very unstable under steam water cycle conditions. It is still found in high temperature and pressure steam-water cycles, though, and therefore it could be hypothesized that it is synthesized in the condensing stages. Acetic acid has higher thermal stability than all other tested compounds and is therefore the dominant organic acid anion at high temperatures. Cationic degradation products were ammonia and some amines, meaning that the complete thermolysis of an amine does not necessarily lead to acidic conditions, as the formed ammonia also provides protection. A model was constructed to predict the thermal stability of the amines in steam-water cycle. More plant data is necessary to fully validate the model. Runs conducted with an experimental two-phase flow-accelerated corrosion loop showed a linear relation between liquid film pH and obtained corrosion rates for the same steam quality. The tested steam quality was not high enough to create the conditions in which ammonia provides insufficient protection against acetic acid, but expanding the liquid film pH model to higher steam qualities does give an idea of the dangers of high acetate concentrations in a steam-water cycle. The models for calculating the pH of the liquid film in two-phase flow and amine thermolysis (if validated) could be connected to assess if alkalizing amine application is recommended for a specific steam-water cycle. In general, it can be concluded from the results that ethanolamine provides better protection against two-phase flow-accelerated corrosion in the presence of organic acid anions, so there is a maximum superheater temperature for each amine at which it can be applied. When ammonia is the only volatile treatment chemical protecting the steam-water cycle, organic acid anions in the plant should be reduced until theoretical pH drop of the two-phase liquid film is acceptable.
