The implementation of distributed phased array hardware was studied {{with the aid of}} the DISTAR computer program as a simulation tool. This simulation provides guidance in hardware simulation. Both hard and soft failures of the amplifiers in the T/R modules are modeled. Hard failures are catastrophic: no power is transmitted to the antenna elements. Noncatastrophic or soft failures are modeled as a modified Gaussian distribution. The resulting amplitude characteristics then determine the array excitation coefficients. The phase characteristics take on a <b>uniform</b> <b>distribution.</b> <b>Pattern</b> characteristics such as antenna gain, half power beamwidth, mainbeam phase errors, sidelobe levels, and beam pointing errors were studied as functions of amplifier and phase shifter variations.

Micro-irrigation systems and fertigation management {{is one of the}} main concerns of the modem citrus fruit production irrespective of availability of soil, water and fertilizer resources. A variety of recommendations have emerged world over on irrigation systems and fertigation based on soil and leaf analysis of the nutrients, evapo-transpiration and water use pattern. The research review of literature has revealed best promising results on irrigation scheduling based on depletion pattern of soil available water content, irrigation systems and fertigation. Various micro-irrigation systems have established their superiority over traditionally used flood irrigation with micro-jets having little edge over rest of the others. Similarly, fertigation has shown good responses on growth, yield, quality and <b>uniform</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>pattern</b> of applied nutrients within the plant rootzone compared to band placement involving comparatively localized fertilization. Automated fertigation in citrus orchards is a new concept, which would be the only solitary choice amongst many irrigation monitoring methods in near future.

5000|$|Much {{discussion}} in the lighting industry and even by some dark-sky advocacy organizations (e.g. International Dark-Sky Association) of the sky glow consequences of replacing the currently prevalent high-pressure sodium roadway lighting systems with white LEDs neglects critical issues of human visual spectral sensitivity, or focuses exclusively on white LED light sources, or focuses concerns narrowly on the blue portion (<500 nm) of the spectrum. All of these deficiencies lead to the incorrect conclusion that increases in sky glow brightness arising from the change in light source spectrum are minimal, or that light-pollution regulations that limit the CCT of white LEDs to so-called [...] "warm white" [...] (i.e. CCT <4000K or 3500K) will prevent sky glow increases. Improved efficiency (efficiency in distributing light onto the target area - such as the roadway - with diminished [...] "waste" [...] falling outside of the target area and more <b>uniform</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>patterns)</b> can allow designers to lower lighting amounts. But efficiency improvement sufficient to overcome sky glow doubling or tripling arising from a switch to even warm-white LED from high-pressure sodium (or a 4-8x increase compared to low-pressure sodium) has not been demonstrated.|$|R
40|$|Abstract It {{has long}} been {{suggested}} that habitat structure affects how colonial birds are distributed within their nesting aggregations, but this hypothesis has never been formally tested. The {{aim of this study}} was to test for a correlated evolution between habitat heterogeneity and within-colony distributions of Ciconiiformes by using Pagel’s general meth-od of comparative analysis for discrete variables. The analysis indicated that central-periphery gradients of distribution (high-quality individuals occupying central nesting locations) prevail in species breeding in homogeneous habi-tats. These were mainly ground-nesting larids and spheniscids, where clear central-periphery patterns were re-corded in ca. 80 % of the taxa. Since homogeneous habitats provide little variation in the physical quality of nest sites, central nesting locations should be largely preferred because they give better protection against predators bymeans of more efficient predator detection and deterrence. By contrast, central-periphery gradients tended to be disrupted in hetero-geneous habitats, where 75 % of colonial Ciconiiform species showed <b>uniform</b> <b>patterns</b> of <b>distribution.</b> Under this model of distribution, edge nest sites of high physical quality confer higher fitness benefits in comparison to low-quality central sites, and thus, high-quality pairs are likely to choose nest sites irrespectively of their within-colony location. Breeding in homogeneous habitats and <b>uniform</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>patterns</b> were identified as probable ancestral states in Ciconiiformes, but there was a significant transition rate from <b>uniform</b> to central-periphery <b>distributions</b> in species occupying homogeneous habitats...|$|R

In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the accumulation of polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), polychlo-rodibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorodibenzofurans (PCDFs), and the chlorinated pesticides 1, 1 -dichloro- 2, 2 -bis(4 -chlorophenyl) -ethene (DDE), 1, 1, 1 -trichloro- 2, 2 -bis(4 -chlorophenyl) -ethane (DDT), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in the breast muscle, liver, lung, heart and brain tissues of adult common swifts (Apus apus, a long-lived aerial feeder bird). Individuals were collected in an urban area located in Rome during the breeding period. As shown by lipid-base normalized data, in general analytes had a significant minimum concentration in the brain. PCDD and PCDF concen-tration values in such tissue were approximately one order of magnitude lower than those found in breast muscle, heart, and lung tissues, {{and as much as}} two orders of magnitude below the relatively high levels found in the liver. PCB levels followed the same accumulation patterns. Of all analytes, HCB exhibited the most <b>uniform</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>pattern</b> over the five matrices assayed. DDE and DDT were by far the most and the least concentrated pesticide. In the urban environment of Rome, an air-to-swift bioconcentration factor (lipid based) in the order of 5 × 106 (2 × 105, fresh tissue base) was estimated for PCDDs and PCDFs.

Meanwhile their economic value have raised concern about their conservation from overharvesting. This study aimed at clarifying the status, structure, distribution {{and diversity of}} the two Jelutung trees in their natural habitats in Jambi Province, Indonesia. Six study sites were selected, which represent gradual transformation habitats of the two tree species, i. e. from dry upland forest to peat swamp forest, {{as well as from}} relatively low disturbance to locally managed forest. Vegetation analysis were performed in 1 Ha plots consisted of 20 m x 20 m square plots and line transects. Results showed that in three dry upland forests only D. costulata was found, while D. lowii was only grown on the other three peat-swamp forests, without any overlapping population suggesting an existence of ecological barrier. In high diversity conservation forest (H ranges 3. 335 - 3. 940) both species were not dominant (IVI= 3. 347 – 18. 763) and found only in narrow stripe of a remnant population. Meanwhile in more disturbed forest area or locally managed jungle (H ranges 1. 820 – 3. 564), the two species were becoming more dominant (IVI ranges 20. 736 – 127. 271), presumably due to preference of local community.

They are crucial {{to the understanding of}} the plant dynamics and plant patterns at population level. Spatial patterns based on individual plant positions (IND) have been extensively investigated in previous studies. However, very few have focused on PC and AGB. We tested the hypothesis that different plant traits represent different spatial patterns and plant-to-plant interactions. Two 40 m × 40 m plots of two typical desert shrub populations (Seriphidium terrae-albae and Artemisia songarica) were surveyed in the Gurbantunggut Desert of north-western China. Each plot was divided into a series of subplots (grids) at different scales (17 scales from 0. 5 m to 20 m) using GIS (geographic information system). The spatial patterns of IND, PC and AGB were determined using aggregation and information dimension analyses together with changes in the scales. The IND and AGB of the two populations exhibited clumped tendencies at all scales (except at the 0. 5 m scale for S. terrae-albae), whereas PC showed <b>uniform</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>patterns</b> at the moderate and small scales, (0. 5 m to 8. 0 m for S. terrae-albae and 0. 5 m to 4. 0 m for A. songarica), indicating that crown-to-crown competition for sunlight was strong at these scales. Although IND had a slightly higher coefficient of variation at the small scales, its information dimension was smaller than those of PC and AGB, indicating that PC and AGB had higher spatial complexities. In conclusion, the three parameters represented different spatial patterns across multiple scales; PC and AGB showed strong spatial complexities and PC was also an accurate indicator of plant-to-plant competition...|$|R
40|$|To begin {{defining}} the key determinants that drive microbial community structure in soil, we examined 29 soil samples from four geographically distinct locations {{taken from the}} surface, vadose zone, and saturated subsurface using a small-subunit rRNA-based cloning approach. While microbial communities in low-carbon, saturated, subsurface soils showed dominance, microbial communities in low-carbon surface soils showed remarkably uniform distributions, and all species were equally abundant. Two diversity indices, the reciprocal of Simpson’s index (1 /D) and the log series index, effectively distinguished between the dominant and uniform diversity patterns. For example, the uniform profiles characteristic of the surface communities had diversity index values that were 2 to 3 orders of magnitude greater than those for the high-dominance, saturated, subsurface communities. In a site richer in organic carbon, microbial communities consistently exhibited the <b>uniform</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>pattern</b> regardless of soil water content and depth. The uniform distribution implies that competition does not shape the structure of these microbial communities. Theoretical studies based on mathematical modeling suggested that spatial isolation could limit competition in surface soils, thereby supporting the high diversity and a uniform community structure. Carbon resource heterogeneity may explain the uniform diversity patterns observed in the high-carbon samples even in the saturated zone. Very high levels of chromium contamination (e. g., > 20 %) in the high-organic-matter soils did not greatly reduce the diversity. Understanding mechanisms that may control community structure, such as spatial isolation, {{has important implications for}} preservation of biodiversity, management of microbial communities for bioremediation, biocontrol of root diseases, and improved soil fertility...|$|E

But, whether {{this is the case}} for desert woody annuals is largely unknown. In the present investigation, the variations in spatial patterns of Tribulus terrestris during different pulse events in semi-arid area of the Thar Desert, India, was quantified. Further ordination technique and path analysis were utilized to link the pattern and process of spatial distribution of T. terrestris. Dispersal indices like index of dispersal (ID), index of clumping (IC), Green’s Index, Lloyd’s mean crowding and Morisita’s index of dispersion (Iδ) revealed <b>uniform</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>pattern</b> during non-pulse events, showing intense competition among plants for limited resources. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) and Bartlett’s test of sphericity indicated the appropriate use of factor analysis and the significant relationships between variables. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) exhibited the significant correlation of the index of dispersion with the index of clumping and with the Lloyd index, while the Lloyd index correlated with the index of clumping and with the Morisita index. Path analysis suggested the association of soil organic carbon, nitrogen, and C/N ratio with the transition from clumped to uniform pattern. Further, lower soil phosphorus also supported the uniform distribution of this plant. Diversity indices like evenness and Simpson index are associated with uniform and clumped distribution patterns. Higher and intermediate level of percent cover and seed out-put of T. terrestris were also related to uniform and clumped patterns.

The distribution of active mitochondria during canine oocyte maturation (both in vitro and in vivo) was assessed with fluorescence and confocal microscopy using MitoTracker Red (MT-Red), whereas chromatin configuration was concurrently evaluated with fluorescence microscopy and DAPI staining. During IVM, oocytes exhibited changes in mitochondrial organization, ranging from a fine <b>uniform</b> <b>distribution</b> (<b>pattern</b> A), to increasing clustering spread throughout the cytoplasm (pattern B), and to a more perinuclear and cortical distribution (pattern C). Pattern A was mainly observed in germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes (96. 4 %), primarily in the non-matured group (P 0. 05). Pattern B was seen in all ovulated oocytes which were fully in second metaphase (MII), whereas in IVM oocytes, 64 % were pattern B, irrespective of duration of culture or stage of nuclear development (P 0. 05). Pattern C was detected in a minor percentage (P 0. 05) of oocytes (mainly those in first metaphase, MI) cultured for 72 or 96 h. In vitro matured oocytes had a minor percentage of pattern B (P 0. 05) and smaller mitochondrial clusters in IVM oocytes than ovulated oocytes, reaching only 4, 11, and 17 % of MII at 48, 72, and 96 h, respectively. Thus, although IVM canine oocytes rearranged mitochondria, which could be related to nuclear maturation, they did not consistently proceed to MII, perhaps due to incomplete IVM, confirming that oocytes matured in vitro {{were less likely to be}} competent than those matured in vivo.

The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the effect of design and material of post with or without ferrule on stress distribution using finite element analysis. Materials and Methods: A total of 12 three-dimensional (3 D) axisymmetric models of postretained central incisors were made: Six with ferrule design and six without it. Three of these six models had tapered posts, and three had parallel posts. The materials tested were titanium post with a composite resin core, nickel chromium cast post and core, and fiber reinforced composite (FRC) post with a composite resin core. The stress analysis was done using ANSYS software. The load of 100 N at an angle of 45 ΀ was applied 2 mm cervical to incisal edge on the palatal surface and results were analyzed using 3 D von Mises criteria. Results: The highest amount of stress was in the cervical region. Overall, the stress in the tapered postsystem was more than the parallel one. FRC post and composite resin core recorded minimal stresses within the post but the stresses transmitted to cervical dentin were more as compared to other systems. Minimal stresses in cervical dentine were observed where the remaining coronal dentin was strengthen by ferrule.

The {{aim of this}} study was to examine the horizontal distribution of Cladocera in a lake connected to a river during low and high water phases and the abiotic factors that determine variation in their populations. Microcrustaceans were collected in integrated samples at 40 sites distributed on a lake. The mean abundance of Cladocera was around five times higher in the low water phase than in the high water phase. Only populations of Bosmina hagmanni Stingelin, 1904 and Bosminopsis deitersi Richard, 1895 predominated in the low water phase, while in the high water phase, B. hagmanni, Ceriodaphnia cornuta f. rigaudi (Sars, 1896) Diaphanosoma spinulosum Herbst, 1975 and Moina micrura Kurz, 1875 predominated at some sampling stations. The majority of cladoceran species showed an aggregated distribution in the low water phase, except B. longirostris and D. fluviatile and, B. longirostris, the only ones which presented a <b>uniform</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>pattern</b> in the high water phase. Most of the aggregates of cladoceran species predominated in both the dry and rainy periods on the east side of the lake due to intense easterly wind. Some cladoceran populations formed isolate aggregates in other parts of the lake and near the lake-river connection site. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed that the variables phosphorus, nitrogen and suspended matter (eutrophic conditions) determined distinct patterns of horizontal distribution in some cladoceran populations at some stations in the low water phase, while in others, the patterns of horizontal distribution were determined by environmental conditions as alkalinity, pH, oxygen, depth and water transparency. In the high water phase, CCA revealed that phosphorus and water transparency were positive determining factors in the distribution of some cladoceran species, while alkalinity, depth and suspended matter were negative.

30|$|At a first glance, {{predictive}} maps {{obtained for}} three (out of four) representative species of harvestmen {{seem to support}} the idea of a <b>uniform</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>pattern.</b> The only species clearly occupying a defined sector in the Uruguayan map is D. prospicuus, which has been considered a representative of the ‘Mesopotamian’ harvestmen-fauna in Argentina (Acosta [2002]). As Acosta and Guerrero ([2011]) showed, range of this species is not typically Mesopotamian since it tends to be limited to the borders of rivers Uruguay and Rio de la Plata, together with some other separate areas. This marginal pattern is clearly reflected in the Uruguayan portion of the species range, following the relationship through the Uruguay River at the west of this country, up to the Rio de la Plata banks (Figure  1). A presumed Paranaense lineage of D. prospicuus is supported by the preference of this species for inhabiting riparian forests and its taxonomic closeness to Discocyrtus bucki (Mello-Leitão [1935]) from Misiones, Argentina (Acosta and Guerrero [2011]). Like in Argentina, this species was observed in riparian forests in western Uruguay. It was also found in sandy habitats of the coast of the Río de la Plata River and Atlantic Ocean (Toscano-Gadea and Simó [2004]). This coast was occupied by psammophile forests in the past. Today, the original habitat was dramatically reduced and fragmented by anthropic activities, and the original vegetation was substituted by exotic plants, only small patches of the original habitat being preserved (Costa et al. [2006]). Considering the drastic reduction of native habitat, D. prospicuus might be considered as a locally threatened species in southern Uruguay; however, it is not known whether its synanthropic habits may counterbalance such a negative pressure, as suggested for other parts of its range, like the Sierras of Córdoba (Acosta and Guerrero [2011]). In this regard, Simó et al. ([2000]) reported the presence of the spiders Parabatinga brevipes (Keyserling [1891]) and Asthenoctenus borellii Simon, [1897] (Ctenidae) in this Uruguayan coastal environment {{as a result of a}} positive anthropogenic influence that expanded the range of both species from their natural habitats. Taking all this into account, the predictive distribution model here obtained could be useful for future environmental studies and conservation plans in the southern coast of Uruguay.|$|E

The pathogenic effects of repeated viral reactivation in infected neurons are still unknown. Several {{studies have reported}} that during HSV- 1 epithelial infection, the virus could modulate diverse cell signaling pathways remodeling the Golgi apparatus (GA) membranes, but the molecular mechanisms implicated, and the functional consequences to neurons is currently unknown. Here we report that infection of primary neuronal cultures with HSV- 1 triggers Src tyrosine kinase activation and subsequent phosphorylation of Dynamin 2 GTPase, two players with a role in GA integrity maintenance. Immunofluorescence analyses showed that HSV- 1 productive neuronal infection caused a scattered and fragmented distribution of the GA through the cytoplasm, contrasting with the <b>uniform</b> perinuclear <b>distribution</b> <b>pattern</b> observed in control cells. In addition, transmission electron microscopy revealed swollen cisternae and disorganized stacks in HSV- 1 infected neurons compared to control cells. Interestingly, PP 2, a selective inhibitor for Src-family kinases markedly reduced these morphological alterations of the GA induced by HSV- 1 infection strongly supporting the possible involvement of Src tyrosine kinase. Finally, we showed that HSV- 1 tegument protein VP 11 / 12 is necessary but not sufficient to induce Dyn 2 phosphorylation. Altogether, these results show that HSV- 1 neuronal infection triggers activation of Src tyrosine kinase, phosphorylation of Dynamin 2 GTPase, and perturbation of GA integrity. These findings suggest a possible neuropathogenic mechanism triggered by HSV- 1 infection, which could involve dysfunction of the secretory system in neurons and central nervous system...|$|R

The seismic time distribution is studied {{in relation to}} the eruptive activity, mainly marked by the 1980 major explosive eruptions and by the 1980 – 1986 dome building eruptions. The spectrum of the generalized fractal dimensions, i. e. Dq versus q, extracted from the data, allows us to identify two main earthquake time <b>distribution</b> <b>patterns.</b> The first one exhibits a multifractal clustering correlated to the intense seismic swarms of the dome building activity. The second one is characterized by an almost constant value of Dq ≈ 1, as for a random <b>uniform</b> <b>distribution...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} our studies on the spatial <b>distribution</b> <b>patterns</b> of aphid populations and of the aphid infested plants in the field showed a spatial <b>distribution</b> <b>pattern</b> of aphids {{aggregated}} at certain density levels. Characteristics of aphid behavior, such as mutual attraction between individual aphids, were the cause for aggregation of soybean aphids. The basic elements of distribution are individual aphid colonies. The aphid infested soybean plants were either uniformly or randomly distributed when infestation rates were low, and <b>uniform</b> <b>distribution</b> prevailed as the infested rates increased to higher levels. Sampling methods such as parallel, chessboard and “Z” pattern sampling, were all applicable {{in the investigation of}} aphid population density. In addition, by referring to the linear regression equation between average crowdedness and mean proposed by Iwao and applying the ? and ? values from the equation to the formulae of theoretical sampling numbers and sequential sampling, we may obtain the theoretical sampling numbers and results of sequential sampling for the investigation of both aphid density and the aphid infestationrate of soybean plants.

The Ostwald-de Waele power law model for the non-Newtonian flow behaviour is assumed in the simulation of the ceramic slurry flow. A local variation of the viscosity (LVOV) model {{as a function of the}} particle volume fraction is introduced and taken into account in the advection and the settling of the particles in the flow field. The results show that using the LVOV model changes the particle <b>distribution</b> <b>pattern</b> from being a constant distribution to a semi-layered one. The presence of such layered structure is highly affecting the subsequent sintering process, which in turn causes anisotropic shrinkage of the dried tapes. Moreover, it is found that increasing the substrate velocity (casting speed) leads to a more <b>uniform</b> <b>distribution</b> of the particles inside the ceramic slurry, in which case the shear induced particle migration is dominating over the gravity induced one...|$|R
