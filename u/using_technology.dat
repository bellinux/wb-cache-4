40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} how two first-year teachers <b>use</b> <b>technology</b> with their students. Each teacher was encouraged to <b>use</b> <b>technology</b> with students at different times in their development as teachers. One teacher participated in Iowa State University 2 ̆ 7 s PT 3 grant project as a member of the TechCo cohort and began her career at a traditional elementary school. The second teacher was not a member of the PT 3 cohort, but began her career at a school that had been a partner with Iowa State University 2 ̆ 7 s PT 3 grant project. A case study analysis of these teachers investigated how each teacher <b>used</b> <b>technology</b> with their students and how their teacher education experience and the institutional and classroom context affected each teacher 2 ̆ 7 s instructional decisions and <b>technology</b> <b>use</b> with students during their initial year in the classroom.;Results from this study demonstrate that these two teachers 2 ̆ 7 personal conceptions about <b>technology</b> <b>use</b> with their students had an affect on how each first-year teacher <b>used</b> <b>technology</b> with her students. Each teacher <b>used</b> <b>technology</b> in meaningful ways with their students, but upon closer examination of this use, it became clear that the personal conceptions about <b>technology</b> <b>use</b> developed during teacher education was an important indicator of how they <b>used</b> <b>technology</b> with students in their own classroom. How each teacher responded to challenges of being a first-year teacher and the support they received within the institutional context could also be analyzed through their personal conceptions about how <b>technology</b> should be <b>used.</b> The study of these two first-year teachers suggests that modeling effective <b>technology</b> <b>use,</b> providing access to technology, and support for technology continue to be important factors in helping new teachers <b>use</b> <b>technology.</b> Results from this study also suggested that the beliefs formed during teacher preparation on the <b>use</b> of <b>technology</b> played a powerful role in how these first year teachers <b>used</b> <b>technology</b> with their students. These results suggest the importance of providing opportunities for preservice teachers to reflect and make conceptual connections between their preparation and practice as they develop and understand their visions of <b>technology</b> <b>use</b> in K- 12 classrooms...|$|R

Setting up camp {{in the land of}} the Bunnokee, a tribe of anthropomorphic rabbit Native Americans, he does good business there. This infuriates the Bunnokee medicine man, whose feather headdress business has declined as a result. He and the Chief of the Bunnokees conspire to eradicate the economic threat, launching war against Popol. <b>Using</b> <b>technology</b> that is more advanced than the Bunnokee's bow and arrows, Popol defeats the rabbits' initial attacks, but they retaliate by abducting Virginia and threatening to torture her. Popol then rescues her, and together they escape, coming upon a river in which they discover gold.|$|E

40|$|This {{study of}} the ways in which social science {{teachers}} in low, middle and high SES high schools <b>use</b> <b>technology</b> in their teaching demonstrated that the digital divide is alive and well in the San Francisco Bay Area. A qualitative research design with ten teacher interviews was employed to gain a deeper understanding of their <b>technology</b> <b>use</b> in the classroom. Four main themes emerged from the data. Teachers from lower SES schools <b>used</b> <b>technology</b> to prepare students for standardized tests, while teachers from higher SES schools <b>used</b> <b>technology</b> to prepare students for college and careers. Although teachers from lower SES schools were unable to workaround technological challenges, teachers from the higher SES schools were able to bypass these problems and <b>use</b> <b>technology</b> to enrich students??? learning. While teachers of low SES students <b>used</b> <b>technology</b> to distribute information, teachers of higher SES students <b>used</b> <b>technology</b> to embellish students??? learning. These technological practices taught low SES students to compartmentalize knowledge, middle SES students to analyze knowledge and high SES students to communicate and collaborate with their peers to create and present knowledge. The acquisition of these skills prepares low SES students for low-level positions, middle SES students for professional positions and high SES students for leadership positions later in life. These findings reveal how differences in <b>technology</b> <b>use</b> across socioeconomically diverse classrooms help to perpetuate social hierarchies and social reproduction...|$|R

5|$|The Resistance execute {{an attack}} on a Nazi {{research}} facility in London, bombing their base of operations, stealing secret documents and prototype stealth helicopters. The documents reveal the Nazis are relying on reverse-engineered technology derived from an ancient organization known as Da'at Yichud, which created such inventions as energy weapons, computer AI's, and super concrete; however, it is also revealed that someone is tampering with the super concrete's formula, making it susceptible to mold deterioration. The Resistance discover a match with Da'at Yichud member Set Roth (Mark Ivanir), who is imprisoned in a forced labor camp. Blazkowicz agrees to go undercover inside the camp and meets Set, who tells him that the Nazis have been <b>using</b> <b>technology</b> made by him and other Jewish scientists to mass-produce and control robots, and offers to help the Resistance in return for the destruction of the labor camp. Blazkowicz finds a battery for a device that controls the camp robots, which he and Set then use to destroy the camp and rescue prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union had not flown {{any further}} flights {{by the time}} MA-7 landed, putting {{both sides of the}} Space Race even at two orbital flights each. While the Soviets had flown for longer, the Mercury program was gaining momentum, with a six-orbit mission {{currently}} planned and press speculation about a one-day mission. However, in mid-August, the Soviet Union launched two orbital missions, Vostok 3 and Vostok 4, within a day of each other. The two craft were in intersecting orbits, but despite much speculation did not attempt to rendezvous; they completed missions of 64 and 48 orbits respectively, just under four and three days, landing within a few minutes of each other on August 15. This was far ahead of anything currently planned for Mercury, and NASA quickly considered the prospect of modifying a capsule to have an active manoeuvring and rendezvous capability, <b>using</b> <b>technology</b> being developed for the Gemini program. However, after examining the time and safety implications of this proposal, it was decided to abandon the idea and continue with the planned six-orbit mission.|$|E
5|$|With Luminous Studio, {{real-time}} {{scenes in}} XV have five million polygons per frame, with character models {{made up of}} about 100,000 polygons each. Character models for XV were constructed with 600 bones, estimated as roughly 10-12 times more than seventh generation hardware. About 150 bones are used for the face, 300 for the hair and clothes, and 150 for the body. For the characters' hair, the team used the same technique as with the characters in Agni's Philosophy. The inner hair for each character uses about 20,000 polygons, five times more than seventh generation hardware. The data capacity for textures is also much greater than before. Each character uses 30 MB of texture data, and ten levels of detail. While seventh-generation games used 50 to 100 MB of texture data for a scene, Final Fantasy XV can use about sixteen times this amount on the PlayStation 4 console. 2048×2048 and 4096×4096 texels are used for the HD textures. For the Microsoft Windows port, Luminous Studio was upgraded <b>using</b> <b>technology</b> from Nvidia.|$|E
