While recognizing <b>universities</b> <b>as</b> institutions with universal features, the author stresses that important insights may be gained by assessing carefully {{the significance of the}} local and national circumstances within which universities have developed. He further argues for an integrative approach - the need to illuminate the dynamics of change through studying the interplay between various spheres of activity in <b>universities,</b> <b>as</b> well as the interplay between the university and its broader social context. Finally, he makes a case for analyzing the <b>universities</b> <b>as</b> suppliers of knowledge for society {{not only in terms of}} instrumental usefulness - as today seems fashionable - but also in terms of knowledge that has served to create cultural identities and "world views"...|$|R
