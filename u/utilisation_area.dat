40|$|Oregano is used {{worldwide}} both as spice {{and crude}} drug, which is mainly provided by species of Origanum genus. The {{quality of the}} product is usually determined by chemical analysis, whereas in food industrial applications sensory tests are also practised. The aim {{of the present study}} was a comparison of parallel quality investigations of oregano samples by a new and effective instrumental sensory evaluation method, the “electronic nose”, and by gas-chromatographic and human sensory analysis. The GC analysis of essential oil components revealed mainly differences between plant species (Origanum vulgare subsp. hirtum and Origanum majorana). Main components of the oil of the former taxon are carvacrol and thymol, while those of marjoram are terpinene- 4 -ol, ?-terpinene and terpinolene. A wholesale oregano sample showing considerable divergence from the other ones with respect to ratios of carvacrol, ß-caryophyllene ß-cubebene and thymol. It was assumed not to belong to ssp. hirtum. The electronic nose analysis, evaluated by PCA, proved to be an appropriate, rapid, non-destructive, reagent-less method for the reliable separation of all of the oregano samples based on their complex aroma features. Assumptions could be made about correlations between separation of samples by the instrumental sensors and proportions of terpenoid compounds of the oil established by GC in some cases only. The varying essential oil content of the samples did not influence the success of instrumental evaluation. The instrumental and human sensory analysis showed similar results: varieties of O. majorana could be well distinguished on the basis of their complex aroma, while their gas-chromatograms did not show characteristic differences. The results call the attention that quality evaluation of drug items of aromatic plants should be oriented in different directions, considering the current <b>utilisation</b> <b>area</b> of the items. ...|$|E
40|$|As the world’s {{population}} and subsequent energy demand increases, {{there is a}} need to supplement existing energy technology with new and alternative approaches. Lignocellulosic biomass represents the vast bulk of terrestrial plant material and possesses both an enormous store of energy and a great potential as a source for biomass derived products. Production of bioethanol from the carbohydrate components of this biomass type is already established, while the remaining 10 - 25 % of the biomass, comprised by an amorphous phenylpropane copolymer called lignin, also holds unique characteristics. Lignin is the most important source of bio-based aromatics in nature, and lignin derived fuels or platform chemicals are approachable by lignin depolymerisation. Thermochemical conversion of lignin by Lignin-to-Liquid solvolysis depolymerises the lignin copolymer through hydrodeoxygenation and yields an energy rich bio-oil high in alkylphenols. In Lignin-to-Liquid solvolysis, formic acid and a co-solvent (ethanol or water) are added to the lignin, and the reaction mixture is exposed to a high temperature and high pressure as a closed system. A major focus within this thesis was to investigate the impact of initial feedstock species and feedstock fractionation and/or pretreatment method on yields of LtL-oil and LtL-oil composition. All feedstock species and pretreatment methods applied generated lignin rich fractions suitable for LtL-solvolysis. Multiple feedstocks were screened through systematic LtL-experiments with ethanol or water as co-solvent and early results lead to water being chosen as preferred solvent in consecutive experiments due to low cost, availability and its benign nature. Optimal substitution order of the generated phenols within the bio-oils depends on desired <b>utilisation</b> <b>area,</b> and ethanol-system experiments generated phenols with a more complex substitution order than water-system experiments. The produced bio-oils were high in aromatic content and water-system experiments produced phenolic components with similar substitution patterns regardless of feedstock preprocessing. The initial oxygen content of the feedstock used in LtL-solvolysis, e. g. due to carbohydrate residues from biomass fractionation, determined the bio-oil yield due to substantial depletion of oxygen through hydrodeoxygenation. This observation shifted the choice of feedstock towards lignin extracted by organosolv fractionation. Organosolv fractionation treats biomass with an organic solvent or mixtures of organic solvents and water to remove lignin. The lignin obtained is of low molecular weight and of high purity. Lignin extracted by organosolv fractionation provided high yields of biooil after LtL-solvolysis, and the yields also showed a positive correlation with the amount of formic acid in the reaction process. The O/C ratio of the phenolic monomers comprising the bio-oils displayed a reduction with increasing reaction temperature. As organosolv extracted lignin thus proved to be highly suitable for LtLsolvolysis, a process for continuous organosolv fractionation of lignocellulosic biomass and solvolytic conversion of lignin was proposed. A semi-continuous flow-through setup for organosolv fractionation was designed and optimal fractionation conditions were determined for a softwood mixture predominantly containing Norway spruce (and ~ 10 % pine). The extracted and isolated lignin was of high purity, in high yields and proved to be very well suited for LtLsolvolysis in subsequent LtL-experiments. LtL-solvolysis of lignin extracted by semi-continuously fractionated lignocellulose displayed high conversion ratios and yields of bio-oil. The biooils’ structural composition were investigated and quantified to examine the impact of experimental parameters and the bio-oils potential industrial employment. Alkylated phenols are presently being used as fuel additives, while phenols rich in oxygenated substituents are valuable for the chemical and pharmaceutical industry. Solvolysis experiments showed reproducible results with high mass recovery and gave a similar response to the reaction conditions as previously observed, confirming that an increased addition of formic acid input increased the bio-oil yield, and an increased reaction temperature reduced the O/C ratio (oxygen content) within the bio-oils. Quantification of the ten most abundant components identified in the oils showed their concentration to be mainly temperature dependent. Hence, tuning experimental conditions towards desirable bio-oil composition, and the development of methods to separate the bio-oils into series of homologs or similar compounds are both necessary and will strengthen the LtL-oils potential as a future platform chemical. </p...|$|E

From the overall input it appears that there are three, equally important, <b>utilisation</b> <b>areas</b> for kinetic data: process development, process optimisation and catalyst development. There is a wide variety of kinetic data sources. Most of the respondents make use of test units which were primarily designed for development and optimisation. Avoiding transport limitation is, certainly in the case of short range projects or for complex feedstocks, not always taken care of. With respect to the modelling approaches, a common philosophy is `as simple as possible¿. Most of the respondents state that `in principle¿ one should strive for intrinsic kinetics, but the majority nevertheless does for various reasons not separate all transport phenomena from reaction kinetics. Kinetic models are mostly simple first or nth order or Langmuir-Hinshelwood type expressions. More complex kinetic models are scarcely used. Three areas were frequently identified to offer opportunities for improvement. Gathering of kinetic data is too costly and time consuming. There is no systematic approach at all for determination and application of kinetics in case of unstable catalytic performance. Furthermore, the software available for the regression of kinetic data to rate equations based on mechanistic schemes as well as software to model reactors are insufficiently user friendly.

40|$|Most of 726 million rural {{populations in}} India is {{dependent}} on agriculture. Rice is the staple food of nearly 65 % {{of the total population}} in India. The production of rough rice reached 135 million tonnes (89 million tonnes of clean rice) in the TE 2002 from 32. 3 million tonnes (20 million tonnes clean rice) in 1950 - 52, primarily {{due to the fact that}} agriculture is in the dynamic path in transforming traditional mode of production to modern agriculture. The paper traces the growth path of rice production along the time scale and analyses the trends and growth at disaggregate level. It shows that the inverted bowl shaped pattern of production growth experienced in during past couple of decades has been a matter of concern for sustainable and likely to threaten the food security. Clearly, the gain due to modern rice technology has been discriminatory against the resource poor areas, which is also dominated by small and marginal farmers. Productivity ranges from a less than 2 tonnes/ha in rainfed areas to as high as 5. 85 tonnes/ ha in irrigated tract in Punjab. The paper attempts to characterize the typology of the change and argues in favour of a likely shift of production base from well-endowed irrigated areas to less well-to-do rainfed areas in India. The shift is justified as the recent changing policy environment designed to divert prime cereal crop lands in favour of crop diversification in several prosperous areas, is likely to affect food security in the country. The reform is also essential in agricultural R&D investment. A new look regionally differentiated R&D policy on rice-plus system (as against the rice-only system) is advocated with special emphasis on resource-rich but poor <b>utilisation</b> <b>areas.</b> Development of modern varieties resilient to biotic and abiotic stresses should be supported by policy intervention to ensure its equitable distribution among the stakeholders. The strategies recommended for the rainfed areas include that the region with low yield and low yield gap requiring "Yield-increasing technology", for the low yield and high g^p areas the strategies on "Appropriate technology, adaptive research and Reaching out to farmers" while the "Higher input efficiency and agricultural diversification" is needed in the high yield and low gap areas. Appropriate intervention on efficient implementation of the developmental programmes, is likely to accelerate the desired growth rate of rice production at a level higher than that of population growth, else the problem of food insecurity will loom large.

In this context full utilisation of the wood raw material used in conventional pulping mills is of vital importance. One focus area {{is to increase the}} <b>utilisation</b> <b>areas</b> of lignin. LignoBoost is a new method to obtain kraft lignin of high purity. The aim of the project was to investigate and increase the ability of LignoBoost kraft lignins to bind metals in aqueous solutions. The metal binding property of kraft lignins was evaluated using copper (II) ions. The metal binding capacities were 1. 76 mg Cu 2 +/g LignoBoost softwood kraft lignin, 0. 96 mg Cu 2 +/g LignoBoost hardwood kraft lignin and 1. 12 mg Cu 2 +/g condensed softwood kraft lignin. The metal binding capacities of the softwood and hardwood kraft lignins from LignoBoost were lower than expected, when compared to the metal binding capacities of other lignins found in literature. The highest copper binding capacity of a kraft lignin found in literature was almost 50 times greater than that of the LignoBoost softwood kraft lignin.   The Mannich reaction was used to increase the nitrogen content in softwood lignin, and thereby increase its electron-donating capacity. An increase in electron-donating capacity should promote its metal binding capacity.   The Mannich reaction occurs in the vacant ortho position of the phenolic groups of lignin, introducing an aminomethyl group at that position. The only vacant ortho position in the phenol unit for reaction is in the guaicyl unit. Softwood lignin underwent a Mannich reaction, since softwood contains a greater number of guaiacyl units than hardwoods.   A screening of the products from this Mannich reaction on LignoBoost softwood kraft lignin was performed to optimise the reaction conditions. The reaction time, temperature, amount of formaldehyde and dimethylamine were varied. The Mannich products were evaluated by elemental analysis. The conditions giving the highest nitrogen content in the product were used further in a Mannich reaction of condensed softwood kraft lignin. The condensed softwood kraft lignin (7 g) was treated with dimethylamine (0. 35 mol) and formaldehyde (0. 35 mol) at 80 °C for 24 hours.   The metal binding experiment could not be carried out with Mannich-modified condensed softwood kraft lignin since the lignin dissolved in the copper solution.   When introducing nitrogen functionalities into lignin the electron-donating capacity should increase. An increase in donor groups should promote the metal binding capacity of the lignin. A problem that occurred when introducing aminomethyl groups was an increase in solubility of the lignin. Water solubility of the lignin derivative is undesirable in the envisaged utilization area, metal binding in, for example mine deposits, from where contaminated water may be a concentrated source of heavy metals...|$|R

40|$|A {{review of}} thirty years’ {{research}} in cervical screening {{was conducted to}} assess the role of social and psychological factors in screening utilisation. The role of age, social class, attitudes towards and beliefs about screening {{as well as social}} influence and personality variables are considered. A reanalysis of reasons for non-attendance following an invitation for screening from ten previous studies is presented and the importance of theoretical accounts of service <b>utilisation</b> in this <b>area</b> are assessed. Research findings show significant associations for both demographic and psychological factors though poor operationalisations and statistical analyses in previous research make difficult the assessment of their importance as additive, interactive or mediational variables. The significance of service provision issues in terms of both providers’ behaviour and the flexibility of delivery is highlighted. The need for further research using a theoretical framework which can unify demographic, psychological and service provision variables is identified. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{explores the}} {{contribution}} of sociodemographic factors to the geographic variation in {{coronary artery bypass graft}} (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure rates in New South Wales, Australia. Methods: With the <b>utilisation</b> of small <b>area</b> analysis and regression model techniques, the possible explanatory factors of the local government area (LGA) level variation in CABG and PCI rates in terms of coronary artery disease prevalence, supply and access to health-care services, socio-economic status and ethnic origin of the people were examined. Results: Multivariate regression results show that distance to hospitals is negatively associated with LGA-specific CABG and PCI rates. The CABG rate is lower and PCI rate is higher in LGAs with higher percentages of Europeanborn residents. Higher proportions of surgeries were recorded for relatively younger people in the lowest socioeconomic LGAs. Conclusions: The focus should be on educating people in the lowest socio-economic LGAs in lifestyle management in order to minimise surgical interventions at a younger age. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Immunisation {{plays an}} {{important}} role in reducing child mortality and morbidity. Although availability and accessibility for immunisation are high in urban <b>areas,</b> <b>utilisation</b> of services was low. Considerable efforts are required to ensure adequate vaccine coverage to reduce morbidity and mortality among children. Hence, the present study was undertaken with the aim to assess the immunisation coverage and factors influencing among children between 13 months to 60 months of age enrolled in Anganwadi Centres in a field practice area of Kurnool Medical College, Kurnool. MATERIALS AND METHODS A cross-sectional study conducted in the field practice area of Urban Health Training Centre and collected necessary details from Anganwadi worker children between ages 13 months to 60 months from September 2016 to October 2016. Children were labelled as ‘fully immunised, partially immunised and not immunised’ according to working definitions. Percentages and chisquare test analysis was done for statistical analysis. RESULTS Out of the 202 under-five children, 70. 79...|$|R
