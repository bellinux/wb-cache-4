40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Massive MIMO is a {{promising}} technique for future 5 G communications {{due to its}} high spectrum and energy efficiency. To realize its potential performance gain, accurate channel state information at transmitter side (CSIT) is essential. Frequency division duplex (FDD) is widely employed by the most cellular systems today. However, it requires unaffordable pilot overhead and has high computational complexity. On the other hand, by exploiting the channel reciprocity using <b>uplink</b> <b>pilots,</b> the <b>time</b> division duplex (TDD) can overcome the overwhelming pilot training {{as well as the}} pilot feedback overhead. Considering these advantages, we propose a subsampling algorithm that can be implemented in a TDD mode. Particularly, we first exploit the intrinsic sparsity of CSIT, and then employ the Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT), which will subsample the received signal at BS, to perform channel estimation. Additionally, we discuss the proposed channel estimation scheme in a multicell scenario. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can accurately estimate channels with reduced computational complexity...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} an <b>uplink</b> <b>pilot</b> and {{downlink}} link adaptation approach {{to improve the}} energy efficiency (EE) of mobile users in time division duplexing (TDD) multi-user multiple input and multiple output (MU-MIMO) systems. Assuming reciprocity between uplink and downlink channels, the downlink transmission is based on uplink channel estimation. While more <b>uplink</b> <b>pilot</b> power ensures more accurate channel estimation and better downlink performance, it incurs higher energy consumption of mobile users. This paper reveals the relationship and tradeoff among pilot power, channel estimation, and downlink link adaptation that achieves the highest energy efficiency for mobile users. We show that the energy efficiency of different users can be decoupled because the downlink average throughput of each user is independent of the pilot powers of other users and energy-efficient design can be done on a per-user basis. Based on the analysis, we propose an <b>uplink</b> <b>pilot</b> and downlink link adaptation algorithm to improve the EE of mobile users. Simulation results are finally provided to demonstrate the significant gain in energy efficiency for mobile users. QC 20140213 low-energy wireless system...|$|R

Unfortunately such a system faces the following difficulties: (1) the pi-ambiguity, and (2) a large phase difference between the downlink and uplink signals. It is shown how the pi-ambiguity can be easily removed by using a two tone uplink signal with both frequencies situated at one side of the downlink frequency, and the phase difference can be greatly reduced with a three tone or a four tone <b>uplink</b> <b>pilot</b> signal...|$|R
40|$|Massive MIMO brings both {{motivations and}} {{challenges}} {{to develop the}} 5 th generation Mobile wireless technology. The promising number of users and the high bitrate offered per unit area are challenged by <b>uplink</b> <b>pilot</b> contamination due to pilot reuse and {{a limited number of}} orthogonal pilot sequences. This paper proposes a solution to mitigate <b>uplink</b> <b>pilot</b> contamination in an indoor scenario where multi-cell share the same pool of pilot sequences, that are supposed to be less than the number of users. This can be done by reducing <b>uplink</b> <b>pilots</b> using Channel State Information (CSI) prediction. The proposed method is based on machine learning approach, where a quantized version of Channel State Information (QCSI) is learned during estimation session and stored at the Base Station (BS) to be exploited for future CSI prediction. The learned QCSI are represented by a weighted directed graph, which is responsible to monitor and predict the CSI of User Terminals (UTs) in the local cell. We introduce an online learning algorithm to create and update this graph which we call CSI map. Simulation results show an increase in the downlink sum-rate and a significant feedback reduction.

40|$|Downlink {{beamforming}} in Massive MIMO either {{relies on}} <b>uplink</b> <b>pilot</b> measurements - exploiting reciprocity and TDD operation, {{or on the}} use of a predetermined grid of beams with user equipments reporting their preferred beams, mostly in FDD operation. Massive MIMO in its originally conceived form uses the first strategy, with <b>uplink</b> <b>pilots,</b> whereas there is currently significant commercial interest in the second, grid-of-beams. It has been analytically shown that in isotropic scattering (independent Rayleigh fading) the first approach outperforms the second. Nevertheless there remains controversy regarding their relative performance in practice. In this contribution, the performances of these two strategies are compared using measured channel data at 2. 6 GHz.

30|$|The OP- 1 in Section 3.3 is {{difficult}} to solve since it involves an optimization over T <b>time</b> <b>slots,</b> M subcarriers, K users, and with MAC-layer QoS requirements.
