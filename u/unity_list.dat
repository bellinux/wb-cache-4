5000|$|The {{operation}} was commanded by NKVD deputy Colonel General Serov, outside {{the control of}} the local Soviet Military Administration (which in a few cases, such as Carl Zeiss AG, tried to prevent the removal of specialists and equipment of vital economic significance for the occupation zone, unsuccessfully, as it turned out, with reportedly only 582 of 10,000 machines left in place at Zeiss). Planned some time in advance to take place after the zone's elections on 20 October, to avoid damaging the Bloc of the Anti-Fascist Democratic Parties <b>Unity</b> <b>List's</b> result, the operation took 92 trains to transport the specialists and their families (perhaps 10,000-15,000 people in all) along with their furniture and belongings. Whilst those removed were offered contracts (the specialists were told that they would be paid on the same terms as equivalent Soviet workers), there was little doubt that failing to sign them was not a realistic option.|$|R
