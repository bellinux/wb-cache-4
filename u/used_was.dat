5|$|An {{anonymous}} chronicler at Bury St Edmunds, {{working in}} the second quarter of the 12th century, produced a compilation now known as The Annals of St Neots. He used material from a version of Asser's work which differs in some places from the Cotton manuscript and in some places appears to be more accurate, so it is possible that the copy <b>used</b> <b>was</b> not the Cotton manuscript.|$|E

5|$|In late 1944 {{the prisoners}} had counterfeited {{the reverse of}} the dollar, and the obverse by January 1945. Twenty samples of the $100 note were produced—without the serial number, whose {{algorithm}} was still being examined—and shown to Himmler and banking experts.

This standard in telephony is still in use today and had remained widespread until it began to be supplanted by digital techniques from the 1980s onwards.|$|E

5|$|On May 10, 1800, the Indiana Territory {{was created}} {{by an act of}} Congress, but no {{provision}} for an official seal was included in the measure. The earliest recorded use of Indiana Territory's seal was on court documents that were signed by Governor William Henry Harrison in January 1801.

5|$|A {{biography}} by Galileo's pupil Vincenzo Viviani {{stated that}} Galileo had dropped balls {{of the same}} material, but different masses, from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their mass. This was contrary to what Aristotle had taught: that heavy objects fall faster than lighter ones, {{in direct proportion to}} weight. While this story has been retold in popular accounts, there is no account by Galileo himself of such an experiment, and it is generally accepted by historians that it was at most a thought experiment which did not actually take place. An exception is Drake, who argues that the experiment did take place, more or less as Viviani described it. The experiment described was actually performed by Simon Stevin (commonly known as Stevinus) and Jan Cornets de Groot, although the building <b>used</b> <b>was</b> actually the church tower in Delft in 1586. However, most of his experiments with falling bodies were carried out using inclined planes where both the issues of timing and air resistance were much reduced.|$|E

5|$|As selected, the Nimrod MRA4 {{was to be}} {{produced}} as essentially a new aircraft. Significant changes {{were involved in the}} remanufacturing process, including the installation of current-generation BR710 turbofan engines, the adoption of a larger and more efficient wing, various new missions systems and avionics, and an extensively refurbished fuselage. Much larger air intakes were required on the MRA4 in order to provide the necessary airflow requirements imposed by the BR710 engine, which is significantly greater than that of the original Spey 250 that had powered the original Nimrod variants. The MRA4 had also borrowed heavily from Airbus technology; the glass cockpit <b>used</b> <b>was</b> derived from the Airbus A340 airliner. British Aerospace also teamed up with Boeing to provide the Nimrod MRA4's mission systems, making use of the later's work on mooted patrol aircraft systems for the P-3 and Boeing 737.|$|E
5|$|Burger King {{introduced}} the Specialty Sandwich line under its Burger King and I promotional campaign {{developed by the}} J. Walter Thompson (JWT) agency.

Actor Stuart Pankin played a doorman in one commercial in the series. Another one of the promotions <b>used</b> <b>was</b> a scratch card game called What's my Specialty? where the customer would receive a card with their purchase in which they would have to match famous people to said person's profession. The commercial explained that if you expected to lose, you would be disappointed, as all cards were winners. Prizes included fries, sodas and sandwiches.|$|E
5|$|Concorde is an {{ogival delta}} winged {{aircraft}} with four Olympus engines {{based on those}} employed in the RAF's Avro Vulcan strategic bomber. It {{is one of the}} few commercial aircraft to employ a tailless design (the Tupolev Tu-144 being another). Concorde was the first airliner to have a (in this case, analogue) fly-by-wire flight-control system; the avionics system Concorde <b>used</b> <b>was</b> unique because it was the first commercial aircraft to employ hybrid circuits. The principal designer for the project was Pierre Satre, with Sir Archibald Russell as his deputy.|$|E

5|$|Cotton was the South's primary export and {{the basis}} of its economy, and the system of {{production}} the South <b>used</b> <b>was</b> dependent upon slave labor. At the outset of the Civil War, Davis realized that intervention from European powers would be vital if the Confederacy was to stand against the Union. The administration sent repeated delegations to European nations, but several factors prevented Southern success in terms of foreign diplomacy. The Union blockade of the Confederacy led European powers to remain neutral, contrary to the Southern belief that a blockade would cut off the supply of cotton to Britain and other European nations and prompt them to intervene on behalf of the South. Many European countries objected to slavery. Britain had abolished it in the 1830s, and Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 made support for the South even less appealing in Europe. Finally, as the war progressed and the South's military prospects dwindled, foreign powers were not convinced that the Confederacy had the strength to become independent. In the end, not a single foreign nation recognized the Confederate States of America.|$|E
5|$|During the Spanish era Rondalya music, where {{traditional}} string orchestra mandolin type {{instruments were}} <b>used,</b> <b>was</b> widespread. In the Philippines, Rondalya refers to {{any group of}} stringed instruments that are played using a plectrum or pick. Filipino instruments are made from indigenous Philippine wood; plectrums, or picks, are made from tortoise-shell. Other stringed instruments composing the standard Filipino rondalla are the 14-string bandurria found only in the Philippines, the laúd, the octavina, the Twelve-string guitar, the Ukulele, the bajo de uñas or double bass, the Guitarrón mexicano, and other Filipino-made instruments modeled and developed after the guitar. Harana and Kundiman are prevalent during this time wherein these songs are often used in courtship rituals.|$|E
5|$|Following mass vaccinations, disease {{detection}} and containment were {{central to the}} eradication campaign. As soon as cases were detected, the victims were isolated as were their close contacts, who were vaccinated. Successes came quickly; by 1970 smallpox was no longer endemic in western Africa, nor, by 1971, in Brazil. By 1973, smallpox remained endemic only in the Indian sub-continent, Botswana and Ethiopia. Finally, after 13 years of coordinated disease surveillance and vaccination campaigns throughout the world, the World Health Organisation declared smallpox eradicated in 1979. Although the main weapon <b>used</b> <b>was</b> vaccinia virus, which {{was used as the}} vaccine, no one seems to know exactly where vaccinia virus came from; it is not the strain of cowpox that Edward Jenner used, and it is not a weakened form of smallpox.|$|E
