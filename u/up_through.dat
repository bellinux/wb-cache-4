5|$|Drilling {{boreholes}} {{through the}} Hamilton Group shales in the subsurface can be problematic. The Marcellus has {{a relatively low}} density, and these shales may not be chemically compatible with some drilling fluids. The shale is relatively fragile, and may fracture under pressure, causing a problem in circulating the drilling fluid back <b>up</b> <b>through</b> the borehole known as lost circulation. The formation may also be under-pressurized, further complicating the drilling process.|$|E

5|$|Enforcement {{of federal}} civil rights law in the South created {{numerous}} peonage cases, which slowly traveled <b>up</b> <b>through</b> the judiciary. The Supreme Court ruled in Clyatt v. United States (1905) that peonage was involuntary servitude. It held that although employers sometimes described their workers' entry into contract as voluntary, the servitude of peonage was always (by definition) involuntary.|$|E
5|$|Fauré's {{ambidexterity}} {{is reflected}} in the layout of many of his piano works, notably in the barcarolles, where the main melodic line is often in the middle register, with the accompaniments in the high treble part of the keyboard {{as well as in the}} bass. Duchen likens the effect of this in the barcarolles to that of a reflection shining <b>up</b> <b>through</b> the water.|$|E
5|$|For 15,000 years, {{native peoples}} {{gathered}} at Wyam {{to fish and}} exchange goods. They built wooden platforms {{out over the water}} and caught salmon with dipnets and long spears on poles as the fish swam <b>up</b> <b>through</b> the rapids and jumped over the falls. Historically, an estimated fifteen to twenty million salmon passed through the falls every year, {{making it one of the}} greatest fishing sites in North America.|$|E

5|$|For presentation, one {{suggestion}} is that the pilchards be arranged with their tails toward {{the centre of the}} pie and their heads poking <b>up</b> <b>through</b> the crust around the edge. As it includes potatoes and pastry, the pie can be served on its own or with crusty bread, sometimes with vegetables. Other suggested accompaniments are Cornish Yarg cheese, rhubarb chutney, poached eggs or a slice of lemon.|$|E
5|$|Lake-effect snow is {{produced}} during cooler atmospheric conditions when a {{cold air mass}} moves across long expanses of warmer lake water, warming the lower layer of air which picks up water vapor from the lake, rises <b>up</b> <b>through</b> the colder air above, freezes and is deposited on the leeward (downwind) shores.|$|E

5|$|After an {{intensive}} planning, maintenance, and briefing period, {{the mission was}} scheduled for January 1, 1967. Poor weather caused a 24-hour delay, but even then, a solid overcast covered the North Vietnamese airbases at Phúc Yên, Gia Lam, Kép, and Cat Bai when the bogus strike force began arriving over the target area, five-minute intervals separating the flights of F-4s. Leading the first flight, Olds overflew the primary MiG-21 base at Phúc Yên and was on a second pass when MiGs finally began popping <b>up</b> <b>through</b> the cloud base. Although at first seemingly random in nature, it quickly {{became apparent that the}} MiGs were ground-controlled intercepts designed to place the supposed F-105s in a vise between enemies to their front and rear.|$|E

5|$|First Officer Hans Oels {{ordered the}} men below decks to abandon ship; he {{instructed}} {{the engine room}} crews to open the ship's watertight doors and prepare scuttling charges. Gerhard Junack, the chief engineering officer, ordered his men to set the demolition charges with a 9-minute fuse but the intercom system broke down and he sent a messenger to confirm the order to scuttle the ship. The messenger never returned and Junack primed the charges and ordered the crew to abandon the ship. Junack and his comrades heard the demolition charges detonate {{as they made their}} way <b>up</b> <b>through</b> the various levels. Oels rushed throughout the ship, ordering men to abandon their posts. After he reached the deck a huge explosion killed him and about a hundred others.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the pattern}} of Hawaiian volcano formation, Kīlauea started as a {{submarine}} volcano, gradually building itself <b>up</b> <b>through</b> underwater eruptions of alkali basalt lava before emerging from the sea {{with a series of}} explosive eruptions about 50,000 to 100,000 years ago. Since then, the volcano's activity has likely been as it is now, a continual stream of effusive and explosive eruptions of roughly the same pattern as its activity in the last 200 or 300 years.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the pattern}} of Hawaiian volcano formation, Mauna Loa would have started as a {{submarine}} volcano, gradually building itself <b>up</b> <b>through</b> underwater eruptions of alkali basalt before emerging from the sea {{through a series of}} surtseyan eruptions about 400,000 years ago. Since then, the volcano has remained active, with a history of effusive and explosive eruptions, including 33 eruptions since the first well-documented eruption in 1843. Although Mauna Loa's activity has been overshadowed in recent years by that of its neighbor Kīlauea, it remains active.|$|E
