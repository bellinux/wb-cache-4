5|$|In 1944, {{when the}} United States {{landed on the}} Philippines to {{recapture}} it, orders had been sent out by the Japanese high command to kill the POWs {{in order to avoid}} them being rescued by liberating forces. One method of the execution was to round the prisoners <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> location, pour gasoline over them, and then burn them alive. After hearing the accounts of the survivors from the massacre at the Puerto Princesa Prison Camp, the liberating forces feared that the safety of the POWs being held in the country was in jeopardy, and decided to launch a series of rescue operations to save the surviving POWs on the islands.|$|E
5|$|A foam is {{a mass of}} bubbles; foams of {{different}} materials occur in nature. Foams composed of soap films obey Plateau's laws, which require three soap films to meet at each edge at 120° and four soap edges to meet at each vertex at the tetrahedral angle of about 109.5°. Plateau's laws further require films to be smooth and continuous, {{and to have a}} constant average curvature at every point. For example, a film may remain nearly flat on average by being curved <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> direction (say, left to right) while being curved downwards in another direction (say, front to back). Structures with minimal surfaces can be used as tents. Lord Kelvin identified the problem of {{the most efficient way to}} pack cells of equal volume as a foam in 1887; his solution uses just one solid, the bitruncated cubic honeycomb with very slightly curved faces to meet Plateau's laws. No better solution was found until 1993 when Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan proposed the Weaire–Phelan structure; the Beijing National Aquatics Center adapted the structure for their outer wall in the 2008 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Later, Gladwell compares Langan with Oppenheimer, {{the father}} of the atomic bomb. Noting that they typify innate natural {{abilities}} that should have helped them both succeed in life, Gladwell argues that Oppenheimer's upbringing made a pivotal difference in his life. Oppenheimer grew <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> of the wealthiest neighborhoods in Manhattan, {{was the son of a}} successful businessman and a painter, attended the Ethical Culture Fieldston School on Central Park West, and was afforded a childhood of concerted cultivation. Outliers argues that these opportunities gave Oppenheimer the chance to develop the practical intelligence necessary for success. Gladwell then provides an anecdote: When Oppenheimer was a student at University of Cambridge he attempted to poison one of his tutors. He avoided punishment, and continued his studies by using the skills gained from his cultivated upbringing in his negotiation with the university's administrators, who had wanted to expel him.|$|E

5|$|On the field, the Australians—captained by Richie Benaud—were successful. They {{defeated}} Pakistan 2–0 {{in three}} Tests, and India 2–1 over five matches. Australia’s only other Test win on Pakistani soil came in 1998 {{and they have}} only won two series in India since the Benaud-Loxton expedition. They also remained unbeaten outside the Test matches. Despite the success with bat and ball, the Australians were struck down by serious illness during {{the second part of}} their tour in India, despite taking Dr. Ian McDonald—a former Victorian first-class cricketer—with the travelling party. Gordon Rorke, Lindsay Kline and Gavin Stevens all contracted hepatitis; the former two were sent home, while the latter was too ill to fly back to Australia {{until the end of the}} tour. Harvey said that Stevens—who never played first-class cricket again after his illness—"could've been the first man to die on tour". Due to the bevy of unfit players, Loxton was forced to line <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> game, against Indian Universities in Bangalore, two years after playing his last first-class match. He scored 33 and bowled six overs without taking a wicket in a high-scoring draw.|$|E

25|$|Centipede {{reproduction}} {{does not}} involve copulation. Males deposit a spermatophore for the female to take <b>up.</b> <b>In</b> <b>one</b> clade, this spermatophore is deposited in a web, and the male undertakes a courtship dance to encourage the female to engulf his sperm. In other cases, the males just leave them for the females to find. In temperate areas, egg laying occurs in spring and summer, but in subtropical and tropical areas, little seasonality to centipede breeding is apparent. A few species of parthenogenetic centipedes are known.|$|E

25|$|Suicide {{bombing was}} also used against the Japanese. A Chinese soldier detonated a grenade vest and killed 20 Japanese {{soldiers}} at Sihang Warehouse. Chinese troops strapped explosives like grenade packs or dynamite to their bodies and threw themselves under Japanese tanks to blow them up. This tactic was used during the Battle of Shanghai, where a Chinese suicide bomber stopped a Japanese tank column by exploding himself beneath the lead tank, and at the Battle of Taierzhuang where dynamite and grenades were strapped on by Chinese troops who rushed at Japanese tanks and blew themselves <b>up.</b> <b>In</b> <b>one</b> incident at Taierzhuang, Chinese suicide bombers obliterated four Japanese tanks with grenade bundles.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the heavy}} {{artillery}} (twelve guns) {{were in place}} however continuous fire from these began to take their effect on the besieged.

The battle lasted three hours, but in the confusion a tremendous explosion appeared behind the attacking French causing the attackers to retreat in panic fearing a Spanish attack in the rear. It had turned out several huge barrels of gunpowder blew <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> of the main French siege batteries (either ignited by accident or by a stray Spanish shot) killing or wounding many.|$|E
25|$|Under Louis XV a {{structure}} was erected {{in the town}} of Versailles to house the multiple activities of the Menus-Plaisirs. It still stands, at 22, avenue de Paris, now rendered famous as the site of the Estates-General of 1789, at which the opening moves of the French Revolution were played out. A provisionally fitted-out space was arranged in the building to seat the Assembly of Notable in 1787, and again in 1788. Then, to accommodate the press of representatives of the three estates, in the Estate-General, a grander but still temporary Salle des États designed by Pierre-Adrien Pâris was set <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> of the two courtyards of the Hôtel des Menus-Plaisirs.

25|$|From 1957 to 1962, {{the station}} was tied <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> of the most heated {{licensing}} disputes in early television history. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) originally awarded the construction permit to build a television station on channel 13 to a group headed by Union Federal Savings and Loan president George Sadlier. However, after an appeal, the FCC reversed its decision and awarded the permit to Crosley. One of the other competitors, Richard Fairbanks, owner of WIBC, then sued to force new license hearings. Fairbanks contended that the FCC had erred in awarding the last VHF channel allocation in Indianapolis to a company based in Cincinnati when there were viable applicants based in Indiana. The suit, however, was filed too late to prevent WLWI from signing on under Crosley ownership.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{comparing}} DNA repair {{capacity in}} different mammalian species {{have shown that}} repair capacity correlates with lifespan. The initial study of this type, by Hart and Setlow, showed that the ability of skin fibroblasts of seven mammalian species to perform DNA repair after exposure to a DNA damaging agent correlated with lifespan of the species. The species studied were shrew, mouse, rat, hamster, cow, elephant and human. This initial study stimulated many additional studies involving {{a wide variety of}} mammalian species, and the correlation between repair capacity and lifespan generally held <b>up.</b> <b>In</b> <b>one</b> of the more recent studies, Burkle et al. studied the level of a particular enzyme, Poly ADP ribose polymerase, which is involved in repair of single-strand breaks in DNA. They found that the lifespan of 13 mammalian species correlated with the activity of this enzyme.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of a}} multi-pronged {{approach}} to a rescue, a Chinook helicopter of No. 27 Squadron RAF was mobilised from Abu Naji to Majar al-Kabir with a quick reaction force onboard. The helicopter lifted off at 11:05am and returned to Abu Naji around 11:30am after coming under sustained fire and having at least seven casualties aboard, who were wounded by the insurgent fire. The helicopters' route into the town meant it having to fly over the rooftops to try and locate Bravo Company who were holed <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> of the houses. Whilst it flew in low, it made itself a target for small arms fire and RPGs, with no less than six RPGs being fired at the helicopter. As {{the damage to the}} helicopter was severe and casualties were mounting, the pilot, Wing Commander Guy Van den Berg, decided that safest option was to return to base. The Sergeant in charge of the QRF asked that the helicopter land away from the immediate danger and allow the non-wounded on board to disembark. Van den Berg replied that if the Chinook landed, it might not get off the ground again.|$|E
