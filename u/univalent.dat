5|$|Hydrogen's {{chemical}} properties {{are not very}} close {{to those of the}} alkali metals, which occupy group 1, and on that basis hydrogen is sometimes placed elsewhere: {{one of the most common}} alternatives is in group 17; one of the factors behind it is the strictly <b>univalent</b> predominantly non-metallic chemistry of hydrogen, and that of fluorine (the element placed on the top of group 17) is strictly <b>univalent</b> and non-metallic. Sometimes, to show how hydrogen has properties both corresponding to those of the alkali metals and the halogens, it may be shown in two columns simultaneously. Another suggestion is above carbon in group 14: placed that way, it fits well into the trends of increasing ionization potential values and electron affinity values, and is not too far from the electronegativity trend, even though hydrogen cannot show the tetravalence characteristic of the heavier group 14 elements. Finally, hydrogen is sometimes placed separately from any group; this is based on how general properties of hydrogen differ from that of any group. The other period 1 element, helium, is sometimes placed separately from any group as well. The property that distinguishes helium from the rest of the noble gases (even though the extraordinary inertness of helium is extremely close to that of neon and argon) is that in its closed electron shell, helium has only two electrons in the outermost electron orbital, while the rest of the noble gases have eight.|$|E
5|$|Calcium {{is a very}} ductile silvery metal with a {{pale yellow}} tint whose {{properties}} {{are very similar to}} the heavier elements in its group, strontium, barium, and radium. A calcium atom has twenty electrons, arranged in the electron configuration 4s2. Like the other elements placed in group 2 of the periodic table, calcium has two valence electrons in the outermost s-orbital, which are very easily lost in chemical reactions to form a dipositive ion with the stable electron configuration of a noble gas, in this case argon. Hence, calcium is almost always divalent in its compounds, which are usually ionic. Hypothetical <b>univalent</b> salts of calcium would be stable with respect to their elements, but not to disproportionation to the divalent salts and calcium metal, because the enthalpy of formation of MX2 is much higher than those of the hypothetical MX. This occurs because of the much greater lattice energy afforded by the more highly charged Ca2+ cation compared to the hypothetical Ca+ cation.|$|E

40|$|The {{frequency}} of chromosome segregation errors during meiosis I (MI) in oocytes increases with age. The two-hit model suggests that errors {{are caused by}} {{the combination of a}} first hit that creates susceptible crossover configurations and a second hit comprising an age-related reduction in chromosome cohesion. This model predicts an age-related increase in <b>univalents,</b> but direct evidence of this phenomenon as a major cause of segregation errors has been lacking. Here, we provide the first live analysis of single chromosomes undergoing segregation errors during MI in the oocytes of naturally aged mice. Chromosome tracking reveals that 80 % of the errors are preceded by bivalent separation into <b>univalents.</b> The set of the <b>univalents</b> is biased towards balanced and unbalanced predivision of sister chromatids during MI. Moreover, we find <b>univalents</b> predisposed to predivision in human oocytes.

40|$|SummaryDuring meiosis I, kinetochores {{of sister}} chromatids are {{juxtaposed}} or fused and mono-orient, while homologous chromosomes that are paired by chiasmata (bivalents) have to biorient. In {{the absence of}} chiasmata, biorientation of sister chromatids (<b>univalents),</b> which carries a risk of aneuploidy, has been occasionally detected in several species, including humans. We show in fission yeast that biorientation of fused sister kinetochores predominates during early prometaphase I. Without chiasmata, this undesirable biorientation of <b>univalents</b> persists and eventually evades the spindle assembly checkpoint, provoking abnormal anaphase. When <b>univalents</b> are connected by chiasmata or by an artificial tether, this erroneous attachment is converted to monopolar attachment and stabilized. This stabilization is apparently achieved by a chromosome configuration that brings kinetochores to {{the outer edge of}} the bivalent, while bringing Aurora B, a destabilizer of kinetochore-microtubule attachment, inward. Our results elucidate how chiasmata favor biorientation of bivalents over that of <b>univalents</b> at meiosis I...|$|R

During meiotic metaphase I, 13 AA bivalents and 13 D <b>univalents</b> are {{expected in the}} hybrid. However, only 28 % of the PMCs had this expected configuration.

Primary bipolar spindles organized around the bivalents and multivalents. In addition to the primary spindle, several secondary and smaller bipolar spindles organized themselves around individual <b>univalents</b> and groups of <b>univalents.</b> Almost all (97 %) of the PMCs showed secondary spindles. Each spindle functioned independently and despite their multiple numbers in a cell, meiosis I proceeded normally, with polyad formation. These observations strongly support the view that in plant meiocytes bilateral kinetochore symmetry is not required for establishing a bipolar spindle and that single unpaired chromosomes can initiate and stabilize the formation of a functional bipolar spindle.

Only the simplest case will be considered here, involving the loop group LU(1) of smooth maps of the circle into U(1) = T. The oscillator semigroup, developed independently by Neretin and Segal, allows contraction operators to be defined for the semigroup of <b>univalent</b> holomorphic maps of the unit disc into itself, extending the unitary operators corresponding to diffeomorphisms of the circle. When applied to the subgroup SU(1,1) of the diffeomorphism group, this gives a generalization of the oscillator representation on L2(R) and its extension to the Olshanskii semigroup.|$|E

40|$|During first meiotic prophase, {{homologous}} chromosomes are normally kept together by both crossovers and synaptonemal complexes (SC). In most eukaryotes, the SC disassembles at diplotene, leaving chromosomes joined by chiasmata. The correct co-orientation of bivalents at metaphase I and the reductional segregation at anaphase I are facilitated by chiasmata and sister-chromatid cohesion. In {{the absence of}} meiotic reciprocal recombination, homologs are expected to segregate randomly at anaphase I. Here, we have analyzed the segregation of {{homologous chromosomes}} at anaphase I in four meiotic mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana, spo 11 - 1 - 3, dsy 1, mpa 1, and asy 1, which show a high frequency of <b>univalents</b> at diplotene.
