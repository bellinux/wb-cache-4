5|$|At the Gansevoort Street end, {{which runs}} north-south, the stub end over Gansevoort Street is named the Tiffany and Co. Foundation Overlook, {{dedicated}} in July 2012; the foundation {{was a major}} backer of the park. Then, it passes under The Standard hotel, and through a passage at 14th Street. At 14th Street, the High Line is split into two sides of different elevations; the Diller-Von Furstenberg Water Feature, opened in 2010, is featured on the lower side, and a sundeck on the <b>upper</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, the city's levee {{and flood}} walls {{designed}} and built by the US Army Corps of Engineers breached in over fifty locations. Storm surge breached the levees of the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal ("MR-GO") in approximately 20 places and flooded all of Saint Bernard Parish, the east bank of Plaquemines Parish and the historic Lower Ninth Ward. The major levee breaches in the city included breaches at the 17th Street Canal levee, the London Avenue Canal, and the wide, navigable Inner Harbor Navigation Canal, which left approximately 80% of New Orleans flooded. There were three major breaches at the Industrial Canal; one on the <b>upper</b> <b>side</b> near the junction with MR-GO, and two on the lower side along the Lower Ninth Ward, between Florida Avenue and Claiborne Avenue. The 17th Street Canal levee was breached on the lower (New Orleans West End) side inland from the Old Hammond Highway Bridge, and the London Avenue Canal breached in two places, on the <b>upper</b> <b>side</b> just back from Robert E. Lee Boulevard, and on the lower side a block in from the Mirabeau Avenue Bridge. Flooding from the breaches put {{the majority of the}} city under water for days, in many places for weeks. Many roads and buildings were damaged by Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
5|$|The Truncata Group {{contains}} all cultivars with features derived {{mainly from the}} species S. truncata: stem segments with pointed teeth; flowers held more or less horizontally, usually above the horizontal, whose <b>upper</b> <b>side</b> is differently shaped from the lower side (zygomorphic); and pollen which is yellow. They generally flower earlier than members of the Buckleyi Group and although common names are not applied consistently may be distinguished as Thanksgiving cactus, crab cactus or claw cactus.|$|E
50|$|When a flattop {{is viewed}} from the front, varying degrees of squarish {{appearance}} are achieved by {{the design of the}} <b>upper</b> <b>sides</b> as they approach and round or angle on to the flat deck. Possibilities are somewhat limited by skull shape, the density of the hair and the diameter of the individual shafts of hair, but may include: boxy <b>upper</b> <b>sides</b> with rounded corners; boxy <b>upper</b> <b>sides</b> with sharp corners; rounded <b>upper</b> <b>sides</b> with rounded corners; rounded <b>upper</b> <b>sides</b> with sharp corners. The hair on the sides and back of the head is usually tapered short, semi-short, or medium.|$|R

Working west, the square base of tower 7 was reinforced with a circular foundation. Tower 8, on the <b>upper</b> <b>side</b> of the front portcullis, has an irregular, but generally square, base. It is also the shortest of the first nine towers. Guarding {{the other side is}} tower 9, which has a square base reinforced by an eight-sided foundation.|$|E
5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of Sigmodontinae, Oryzomys couesi has a complex penis, with the baculum (penis bone) ending in three cartilaginous digits at its tip. The outer surface of the penis is mostly covered by small spines, {{but there is a}} broad band of nonspinous tissue. The papilla (nipple-like projection) on the dorsal (<b>upper)</b> <b>side</b> of the penis is covered with small spines, a character Oryzomys couesi shares only with Oligoryzomys and the marsh rice rat among oryzomyines examined. On the urethral process, located in the crater {{at the end of the}} penis, a fleshy process (the subapical lobule) is present; it is absent in all other oryzomyines with studied penes except the marsh rice rat and Holochilus brasiliensis.|$|E
5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of Sigmodontinae, the marsh rice rat and O.couesi have a complex penis, with the baculum (penis bone) displaying large protuberances at the sides. The outer surface of the penis is mostly covered by small spines, {{but there is a}} broad band of nonspinous tissue. The papilla (nipple-like projection) on the dorsal (<b>upper)</b> <b>side</b> of the penis is covered with small spines, a character these two species share only with Oligoryzomys among oryzomyines examined. On the urethral process, located in the crater {{at the end of the}} penis, a fleshy process (the subapical lobule) is present; it is absent in all other oryzomyines with studied penes except Holochilus brasiliensis. Both traits are recovered as synapomorphies of O.couesi plus the marsh rice rat in Weksler's analysis.|$|E

5000|$|When {{cutting a}} new flattop or when cutting a flattop with full boxy or boxy rounded <b>upper</b> <b>sides</b> or a flattop with fenders, the {{hair at the}} <b>upper</b> <b>sides</b> and top has to be boxed in. If {{the hair on the}} <b>upper</b> <b>sides</b> is {{initially}} contoured, it may not be possible to achieve a squarish effect. The hair at the crown is cut from about one quarter to one half inch while the barber stands behind the patron. He then positions himself in front and cuts the top hair to about two inches in length and then to the desired height across the top from side to side while progressing back to the shorter hair at the crown.|$|R

5|$|Flatfish are {{demersal}} fish (bottom-feeding fish) that show {{a greater degree}} of asymmetry than any other vertebrates. The larvae are at first bilaterally symmetrical but they undergo metamorphosis during the course of their development, with one eye migrating {{to the other side of}} the head, and they simultaneously start swimming on their side. This has the advantage that, when they lie on the seabed, both eyes are on top, giving them a broad field of view. The <b>upper</b> <b>side</b> is usually speckled and mottled for camouflage, while the underside is pale.|$|E
5|$|In {{the month}} {{following}} the disastrous loss of four fleet carriers at the June 1942 Battle of Midway, the IJN ordered the ship's unfinished hull converted into an aircraft carrier. Her hull was only 45 percent complete by that time, with structural work complete {{up to the}} lower deck and most of her machinery installed. The main deck, lower side armor, and <b>upper</b> <b>side</b> armor around the ship's magazines had been completely installed, and the forward barbettes for the main guns were also nearly finished. The navy decided that Shinano would become a heavily armored support carrier—carrying reserve aircraft, fuel and ordnance in support of other carriers—rather than a fleet carrier.|$|E
5|$|Myotis alcathoe is the {{smallest}} European Myotis species. The fur is brownish on the upperparts, with a reddish tone in old specimens, and a slightly paler gray-brown below. Younger animals may be completely gray-brown. The brown fur distinguishes adult M.alcathoe from other whiskered bats, but juveniles cannot be unambiguously identified {{on the basis of}} morphology. M.alcathoe is similar to Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii) and M.emarginatus in color. On the <b>upper</b> <b>side</b> of the body, the hairs are 6 to 8mm long and have dark bases and brown tips. The hairs on the lower side of the body are only slightly paler at the tip than at the base.|$|E

5|$|Portia fimbriata, {{sometimes}} called the fringed jumping spider, is a jumping spider (family Salticidae) found in Australia and Southeast Asia. Adult females have bodies 6.8 to 10.5millimetres long, while those of adult males are 5.2 to 6.5millimetres long. Both sexes have a generally dark brown carapace, reddish brown chelicerae ("fangs"), a brown underside, dark brown palps with white hairs, and dark brown abdomens with white spots on the <b>upper</b> <b>side.</b> Both sexes have fine, faint markings and soft fringes of hair, and the legs are spindly and fringed. However, specimens from New Guinea and Indonesia have orange-brown carapaces and yellowish abdomens. In all species of the genus Portia, the abdomen distends when the spider is well fed or producing eggs.|$|E
5|$|When light {{falls from}} above on a uniformly {{coloured}} three-dimensional object {{such as a}} sphere, it makes the <b>upper</b> <b>side</b> appear lighter and the underside darker, grading {{from one to the}} other. This pattern of light and shade makes the object appear solid, and therefore easier to detect. The classical form of countershading, discovered in 1909 by the artist Abbott Handerson Thayer, works by counterbalancing the effects of self-shadowing, again typically with grading from dark to light. In theory this could be useful for military camouflage, but in practice it has rarely been applied, despite the best efforts of Thayer, and later, in the Second World War, of the zoologist Hugh Cott.|$|E
5|$|Hindfoot {{length is}} 37mm (1.5in). The upper {{sides of the}} feet are covered with grayish white fur, which extends around the claws to form ungual tufts. On the hindfeet, the fifth digit is {{relatively}} short at 6mm (0.2in); the hallux (first digit) is 8mm (0.3in) long, and the other digits 11 to 12mm (0.4 to 0.5in). The tail is 238mm (9.4in) long and naked in part. At the base, it is dark brown both above and below, but slightly lighter below. The <b>upper</b> <b>side</b> remains dark brown for much of its length, though the color does become lighter towards the tip. The lower side becomes mottled at about 55mm (2.2in) from the tip and then whitish at about 65mm (2.6in). It has a well-developed tuft at its tail tip, consisting of whitish and occasional light brown hairs. This tuft commences at about 130mm (5.1in) from the base with fairly short hairs and becomes more pronounced at 180mm (7.1in). In contrast, the greater big-footed mouse has a weaker, dark brown tuft.|$|E

5|$|In the female, the pilus dentilis, a sensory organ on the {{chelicera}} (mouthpart), is serrate, not {{smooth as}} in A.gymnuromys. The idiosoma (main {{part of the}} body) is 630 to 670μm long and 370 to 435μm wide and the dorsal shield (covering the <b>upper</b> <b>side)</b> is 620 to 655μm long and 360 to 370μm wide. The dorsal setae (bristles) are long relative to A.gymnuromys. The sternal shield (on the lower {{side of the body}}) is 115 to 125μm long and 184 to 200μm wide and is more ornamented than in A.gymnuromys. Unlike A.eliurus, A.voalavo lacks distinct sternal glands (secretory organs) between the lyrifissures (sensory organs) iv1 and iv2 on the lower side of the body. The other shields on the lower side of the body are the genitoventral shield (232 to 253 by 170 to 182μm), the peritrematic shield (140 to 147 by 117 to 127μm), and the anal shield (140 to 147 by 117 to 127μm). On the soft part of the cuticle, there are nine pairs of setae. The first segments of the legs, the coxae, lack hooks. On the coxae of the third pair of legs, the setae at the back are spur-like.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus brachytragos is a small, short-tailed Miniopterus {{with short}} and {{relatively}} thin fur. The fur of the upperparts is dark brown and {{the hairs on}} the underparts have buff tips. Miniopterus mahafaliensis is similar in color, but other small Malagasy Miniopterus are darker. The ears are haired above, but virtually naked below and end in a rounded tip. The tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is short and has a broad base, sometimes with a crest at the side. It ends in a pointed to slightly rounded tip, which is covered with hairs that are not readily visible to the unaided eye. The short tragus easily distinguishes M.brachytragos from other Malagasy Miniopterus. The wing membrane is also brown, but the uropatagium (tail membrane) is lighter. The wing membrane and uropatagium are attached to the upper leg at the same level, above the ankle. The uropatagium is relatively densely covered with hairs, particularly on the <b>upper</b> <b>side.</b> M.manavi and M.mahafaliensis also have a densely haired uropatagium, but in M.aelleni and M.griveaudi it is only sparsely haired or even mostly naked.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus mahafaliensis is a small, short-tailed Miniopterus {{with long}} and dense fur. The fur of the upperparts is brown and {{the hairs on}} the underparts have gray tips. Miniopterus brachytragos is similar in color, but other small Malagasy Miniopterus are darker. The ears are {{partially}} haired above, but virtually naked below and end in a rounded tip. The tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is relatively thick, has the sides mostly parallel, and ends in a curved, rounded tip. The wing membrane is also brown, but the uropatagium (tail membrane) is lighter. The wing membrane and uropatagium are attached to the upper leg at the same level, above the ankle. The uropatagium is relatively densely covered with hairs, particularly on the <b>upper</b> <b>side.</b> M.manavi and M.brachytragos also have a densely haired uropatagium, but in M.aelleni and M.griveaudi it is only sparsely haired or even mostly naked.|$|E
5|$|Other {{studies suggest}} that rivaling Carnotaurus did not deliver rapid head blows, but pushed slowly against each other with the <b>upper</b> <b>sides</b> of their skulls. Thus, the horns {{may have been a}} device for the {{distribution}} of compression forces without damage to the brain. This is supported by the flattened <b>upper</b> <b>sides</b> of the horns, the strongly fused bones of the top of the skull, and the inability of the skull to survive rapid head blows.|$|R

5|$|The most {{decorated}} room in {{the building}} is the Sala Nobile (Noble Hall) on the first floor, which was originally a courthall, and which is now used as a meeting room. Here the judge and the nominated College of Advocates sat on a bench, which itself was a platform, wearing typical silk gown clothing of the period. The advocates on the bench were nominated and removed {{at the discretion of}} the Grand Master. When Malta was a British colony a similar short lived system was adopted, on 14 August 1832, known as the King's Counsel. The bench consisted of the Advocates of the King, and survived seven years. This room has coats-of-arms of the Castellani depicted on the <b>upper</b> <b>side</b> of the walls. There are 105 coats-of-arms, belonging to the Castellani from 1609 to the last in 1798, after which the position was abolished.|$|E
5|$|Various {{distinguishing}} {{traits of}} the lower jaw have been established. The longitudinal groove on the outer surface of the dentary is wide. The third tooth socket of the dentary is not enlarged. Seen from above, the dentary is straight without an expanded jaw tip. The interdental plates, reinforcing the teeth from behind, {{of the lower}} jaw are tall. Benson also concluded it would be most parsimonious {{to assume that the}} Stonesfield Slate material represents a single species. If so, several additional distinctive traits can be observed {{in other parts of the}} skeleton. The low vertical ridge on the outer side of the ilium, above the hip joint, shows parallel vertical grooves. The bony skirts between the shafts of the ischia are thick and touch each other forming an almost flat surface. There is a boss present on the lower outer side of the ischium shaft with a rough surface. The underside of the second sacral vertebra has an angular longitudinal keel. A ridge on the <b>upper</b> <b>side</b> of the third metatarsal connected to a groove in the side of the second metatarsal. The middle of the front edge of the scapula forms a thin crest.|$|E
5|$|Females of the {{jumping spider}} Portia fimbriata have bodies 6.8 to 10.5millimetres long, while those of adult males are 5.2 to 6.5millimetres long. The Queensland variety is {{typically}} {{smaller than the}} Northern Territory variety. The cephalothorax is about 4millimetres long and 3millimetres wide, and the abdomen about 4millimetres long and 2.2millimetres wide. The front of the cephalothorax is large and angular, and the face is broad, high and flat. In Australia and Taiwan, both sexes have a generally dark brown carapace, reddish brown chelicerae ("jaws"), a brown underside, and dark brown palps with white hairs. Both sexes also have fine, faint markings and soft fringes of hair. However, the female has a white fringe just above the chelicerae, while the back half of the male's cephalothorax has a white band round the bottom edge and a white groove down the back. While male spiders' palps are larger than females', the palps of P.fimbriata females have a fringe of hair that makes them look about as larger as males'. The abdomens of both sexes are dark brown, with white spots on the <b>upper</b> <b>side.</b> Wanless' female from New Guinea has an orange carapace and chelicerae with sooty markings, palps mainly light yellow, legs orange-brown legs, and abdomen light yellow. Wanless also found a male from the Amboina area in Indonesia, showing an orange-brown carapace and chelicerae, yellow-brown to orange-brown palps, orange-brown legs and a light yellowish abdomen.|$|E
