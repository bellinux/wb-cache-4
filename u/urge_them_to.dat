5|$|Returning to Odessa, {{he got a}} job distributing newspapers. This respectable work {{required}} {{getting up}} at 6 a.m., not good for a carouser. Still, newspaper connection meant that he soon heard of one of the war's other effects: the many Jewish merchants and middlemen war brought to Bucharest were a boon to Abraham Goldfaden's nascent Yiddish theater there. Two of his Odessa acquaintances—Israel Rosenberg, a personable con-man, and Jacob Spivakofsky, scion of a wealthy Jewish family—had become actors there, then had left Goldfaden to found their own company, touring in Moldavia. Adler wrote them to <b>urge</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> bring their troupe to Odessa.|$|E

25|$|About 300,000 {{troops and}} 1.1million reservists were {{deployed}} to assist relief efforts and snow removal across {{various parts of}} affected regions. The government also announced a $700million (2008 USD) plan for helping farmers who had their crops destroyed by the winter weather. In addition, the government spent over 330million yuan for local disaster relief operations. On 1 February, Premier Wen held a State Council meeting to discuss matters related to the snowstorms, and immediately afterwards flew out to Hunan to inspect relief efforts. General Secretary, President Hu visited various coal mines to <b>urge</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> help end power shortages.|$|E

25|$|The show {{focuses on}} {{sensitive}} social issues prevalent in India such as female foeticide, child sexual abuse, rape, honour killings, domestic violence, untouchability, alcoholism, and the criminalization of politics. It aims {{to bring the}} great achievements of people which often go unnoticed {{in order to encourage}} the audience to achieve their goals no matter what comes in between. It also aims to empower citizens with information about their country, and <b>urge</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> take action. While the primary language of the show is Hindi, it is simulcast in eight languages such as Bengali, Malayalam, Marathi, Tamil and Telugu, and subtitled in English, to ensure maximum reach.|$|E
25|$|Ramos-Horta {{arrived in}} New York {{to address the}} UN Security Council and <b>urge</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> take action {{in the face of}} the Indonesian {{occupation}} during which an estimated 102,000 East Timorese would die. Ramos-Horta was the Permanent Representative of Fretilin to the UN for the next ten years. His friends at that time mentioned that he arrived in the United States with a total of $25 in his pocket. His pecuniary situation was often straitened in that period; he survived partly by grace of Americans who admired his politics and his determination. Further, he was obliged to travel worldwide to explain his party's position.|$|E
25|$|While {{the project}} was still in its initial stage of development, bitter {{disagreements}} and quarrels broke out among the scholars {{due to differences in}} opinion. Xu Ci and Hu Qian started making accusations and taking petty revenge against each other. They bickered among themselves and constantly sought opportunities to provoke each other. They also praised themselves and scorned their colleagues. When Liu Bei heard about it, he came up with an idea to <b>urge</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> put aside their differences and cooperate with each other. He gathered all the officials for a feast and had actors put up a skit parodying the conflict between Xu Ci and Hu Qian, showing how a war of words between them led to them using weapons to attack each other. Despite Liu Bei's efforts, the project ultimately {{turned out to be a}} failure.|$|E

500|$|His {{most infamous}} venue was The Tunnel Club, which he opened in 1984 {{next to the}} {{southern}} exit from the Blackwall Tunnel in Greenwich, South East London. He would sometimes introduce inexperienced stand-ups to audiences with the nerve-jangling line: [...] "This next act's probably a bit shit" [...] but, once their performance was finished, he would often comfort those he thought showed promise with backstage words of encouragement and <b>urge</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> try again. His advice to comics who were concerned that a joke might be offensive to an audience was: [...] "If you think it’s funny, then fuck ’em." ...|$|E
500|$|Arnold was {{the only}} member of the colony besides Roger Williams who was highly {{proficient}} in the Narragansett and Wampanoag tongues, and he was often called upon to interpret during negotiations. [...] In June 1645, he was sent by the General Court of Massachusetts to the Narragansett people to <b>urge</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> desist from engaging in a war with the Mohegans. [...] On 28 July, Arnold and two others were sent to get the hostile tribes to send deputies to Boston to talk and make peace. [...] This attempt failed and, a month later, Arnold would not go back again, as he had been charged with misrepresenting the reply of the tribes, and Roger Williams went as interpreter in his place.|$|E
500|$|On his return, Lafayette {{found the}} American cause {{at a low}} ebb, rocked by several {{military}} defeats, especially in the south. Lafayette was greeted in Boston with enthusiasm, seen as [...] "a {{knight in shining armor}} from the chivalric past, come to save the nation". He journeyed southwest and on 10 May 1780 had a joyous reunion with Washington at Morristown, New Jersey. The general and his officers were delighted to hear that the large French force promised to Lafayette would be coming to their aid. Washington, aware of Lafayette's popularity, had him write (with Alexander Hamilton to correct his spelling) to state officials to <b>urge</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> provide more troops and provisions to the Continental Army. This bore fruit in the coming months, as Lafayette awaited the arrival of the French fleet. However, when the fleet arrived, there were fewer men and supplies than expected, and Rochambeau decided to wait for reinforcements before seeking battle with the British. [...] This was unsatisfactory to Lafayette, who proposed grandiose schemes for the taking of New York City and other areas, and Rochambeau briefly refused to receive Lafayette until the young man apologized. Washington counseled the marquis to be patient.|$|E

500|$|The Cup {{was awarded}} every year until 2005, when a labour {{dispute between the}} NHL's owners and the NHL Players Association (the union that {{represents}} the players) led to the cancellation of the 2004–05 season. As a result, no Cup champion was crowned {{for the first time}} since the flu pandemic in 1919. The lockout was controversial among many fans, who questioned whether the NHL had exclusive control over the Cup. A website known as freestanley.com (since closed) was launched, asking fans to write to the Cup trustees and <b>urge</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> return to the original Challenge Cup format. Adrienne Clarkson, then Governor General of Canada, alternately proposed that the Cup be presented to the top women's hockey team in lieu of the NHL season. This idea was so unpopular that the Clarkson Cup was created instead. Meanwhile, a group in Ontario, also known as the [...] "Wednesday Nighters", filed an application with the Ontario Superior Court, claiming that the Cup trustees had overstepped their bounds in signing the 1947 agreement with the NHL, and therefore must award the trophy regardless of the lockout.|$|E
500|$|Following the debates, Perot did not {{campaign}} {{and was not}} seen on television until {{later in the week}} when ABC aired a 30-minute sequel to an autobiographical infomercial shown on October 17. The spot cost Perot $370,000. CBS aired an infomercial on October 24 entitled The Ross Perot Nobody Knows, and two days later another was shown on ABC, preceding the kickoff of Monday Night Football, which cost $940,000. Perot hoped to better explain his earlier exit as Election Day neared. Reports circulated that a security official from the campaign had contacted the Dallas Police in August to <b>urge</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> perform a sting operation targeting Bush campaign adviser James Oberwetter, in response to allegations that Republicans planned to wiretap Perot's office. Perot claimed during an interview with 60 Minutes that [...] "Republican operatives" [...] also threatened to disrupt his daughter's wedding, which forced him to withdraw in July. He reported the story to the FBI, but no evidence of any wrongdoing was found. The New York Times argued that the story could help Perot with voters and his overall image by presenting him as a man [...] "who was willing to give up his goal to protect his family"; nevertheless, his lack of evidence drew criticism.|$|E
500|$|The new Zimbabwean {{parliament}} {{opened on}} 15 May 1980, {{a month after}} formal independence from Britain, with Smith as the reconstituted country's first Leader of the Opposition. Continuing a long-standing tradition from the Rhodesian era, the government and opposition entered the House in pairs—Mugabe and Smith walked in {{side by side with}} their respective MPs following, [...] "aptly symbolis the mood of reconciliation", Martin Meredith comments. With around 1,000 whites leaving Zimbabwe each month, Smith took to the radio to <b>urge</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> stay and give Mugabe's new order a chance, but over half of the country's whites left within three years. As Meredith records, the 100,000 or so who remained [...] "retreated into their own world of clubs, sporting activities, and comfortable living". Mugabe made great efforts when he first took power to endear himself to the white farming community, which accounted for at least 75% of Zimbabwe's agricultural output. Amid booming Zimbabwean commodity prices in the years immediately following 1980, many white commercial farmers came to support Mugabe. The new Prime Minister continued cordially meeting Smith until the RF leader took him to task in 1981 for openly calling for a one-party state; Smith said this was putting off foreign investors. Mugabe was not impressed and, according to Smith, refused to ever meet him again.|$|E

2500|$|Democratic Representative Steve Israel of the 2nd District in New York said in Newsday, [...] "While {{they have}} a {{constitutional}} right to build the mosque, {{it would be better if}} they had demonstrated more sensitivity to the families of 9/11 victims.

2500|$|Democratic Representative Tim Bishop of New Yorks 1st District also {{disagrees with}} the location, [...] "As a New Yorker, I believe Ground Zero is sacred ground and should unite us.

In Washington State, for example, the four Catholic bishops were reported as [...] "intensifying a campaign of pastoral statements and videos urging parishioners to vote against marriage equality" [...] under Referendum 74.|$|E
