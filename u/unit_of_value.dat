500|$|In January 1791, at {{the request}} of Congress, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton issued a report on the currency. [...] At the time, there was no mint in the United States; foreign coins were used. Hamilton {{proposed}} a monetary system based on bimetallism, in which the new currency would be equal to a given amount of gold, or a larger amount of silver; at the time a given weight of gold was worth about 15 times as much as the same amount of silver. Although Hamilton understood that adjustment might be needed from time to time as precious metal prices fluctuated, he believed that if the nation's <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>value</b> were defined only by one of the two precious metals used for coins, the other would descend to the status of mere merchandise, unusable as a store of value. He also proposed the establishment of a mint, at which citizens could present gold or silver, and receive it back, struck into money. On April 2, 1792, Congress passed the Mint Act of 1792. This legislation defined a <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>value</b> for the new nation, to be known as a dollar. The new unit of currency was defined to be equal to [...] of gold, or alternatively, [...] of silver, establishing a ratio of value between gold and silver of 15:1. The legislation also established the Mint of the United States.|$|E

60|$|Second: whilst I {{estimate}} {{in terms}} of money, I assume {{that there is no}} revolutionary change in the purchasing power of our <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>value.</b> If the value of gold were to sink to a half or a tenth of its present value, the real burden of a payment fixed {{in terms of}} gold would be reduced proportionately. If a sovereign comes to be worth what a shilling is worth now, then, of course, Germany can pay a larger sum than I have named, measured in gold sovereigns.|$|E
50|$|One work-around {{is looking}} for {{divisions}} which are only approximately-envy-free. There {{are two ways to}} define the approximation - in <b>units</b> <b>of</b> length or in <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>value.</b>|$|R

60|$|In {{the first}} place, the vast {{expenditures}} of the war, the inflation of prices, and the depreciation of currency, {{leading up to}} a complete instability of the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>value,</b> have made us lose all sense of number and magnitude in matters of finance. What we {{believed to be the}} limits of possibility have been so enormously exceeded, and those who founded their expectations on the past have been so often wrong, that the man in the street is now prepared to believe anything which is told him with some show of authority, and the larger the figure the more readily he swallows it.|$|E

My slight but rough and ready knowledge of medicine and surgery stood me in good stead, and I became indispensable. From a slave, I worked myself to a seat among the head men, and in war and peace, so soon as I had learned their ways, was an unchallenged authority. Reindeer was their medium of exchange, their <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>value</b> as it were, and we were almost constantly engaged in cattle forays among the adjacent clans, or in protecting our own herds from their inroads. I improved upon their methods, taught them better strategy and tactics, and put a snap and go into their operations which no neighbor tribe could withstand.|$|E
6000|$|There was no answer; {{at least}} there was an instant's hesitation, and the answer, if it came, was lost in the report of the sentinel's rifle. In the silence of the night and the forest the sound was deafening, and hardly had it died away when it was {{repeated}} by the pieces of the pickets to right and left, a sympathetic fusillade. For two hours every unconverted civilian of them had been evolving enemies from his imagination, and peopling the woods in his front with them, and Grayrock's shot had started the whole encroaching host into visible existence. Having fired, all retreated, breathless, to the reserves--all but Grayrock, who did not know in what direction to retreat. When, no enemy appearing, the roused camp two miles away had undressed and got itself into bed again, and the picket line was cautiously re-established, he was discovered bravely holding his ground, and was complimented by the officer of the guard as the one soldier of that devoted band who could rightly be considered the moral equivalent of that uncommon <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>value,</b> [...] "a whoop in hell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Though they're {{singularly}} awkward <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>value</b> {{for any one}} {{accustomed to}} a decimal coinage: so unreasonable and illogical," [...] the stranger continued blandly, turning over the various pieces with a dubious air of distrust and uncertainty.|$|R
2500|$|In {{cases where}} the <b>unit</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the {{reference}} is stated, the decibel value is known as [...] "absolute".

50|$|The paradox <b>of</b> <b>value</b> was {{observed}} and debated by classical economists. Adam Smith described {{what is now}} called the diamond - water paradox: diamonds command a higher price than water, yet water is essential for life and diamonds are merely ornamentation. Use value was supposed to give some measure of usefulness, later refined as marginal benefit (which is marginal utility counted in common <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>value)</b> while exchange value was the measure of how much one good was in terms of another, namely {{what is now called}} relative price.|$|R
6000|$|The {{principal}} chief {{opened his}} pack slowly and spread its contents {{on the counter}} with care. He did not hurry himself, being a very dignified man. There were beavers, martens, otters, silver-foxes, and many other valuable furs, for which large sums are given in the European markets. To obtain these, however, the Company of Traders had to expend very large sums in transporting goods into those northern wilds, and still larger sums {{would have to be}} paid to voyageurs, clerks, and employes generally, as well as risks run and time spent before these furs could be conveyed to market and turned into gold--hence our red chief had to content himself with moderate prices. These prices, moreover, he did not himself put on his furs. Lumley did that for him, according to the tariff used by the fur-traders all over the country, every article being rated at a standard <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>value,</b> styled a [...] "made-beaver" [...] {{in some parts of the}} country--a [...] "castore" [...] in other parts. On the counter was marked, with a piece of chalk, the value of each fur--a beaver was valued at so many castores, according to its quality, a fox at so many--and when the sum was added up, the total was made known by a number of goose-quills being presented to the chief, each quill representing a castore. The Indians, being acquainted with this process, did not require to have it explained.|$|E

Amongst the many desiderata of the Coast is a law making all our silver coins legal tenders. At present the natives will scarcely take anything but threepenny-bits, new and bright and bearing H.B.M.'s 'counterfeit presentment.' Copper has been tried, but was made to fail by a clever District-commissioner, who refused to take the metal in payment of Government dues. The old cowrie-currency, of which the tapo, or score, represented two farthings, is all but extinct. Its name will be preserved in the proverb, 'There is no market wherein the dove with the pouting breast (the cypraea) has not traded.' The same {{is the case with}} the oldest money, round and perforated quartz-stones, which suggest the ring-coinage of ancient Egypt. From Inyenápoli, preceded by King Blay, who so managed that a fair path had been hastily cut through the bush, we struck inland, the course being northwards, bending to the north-east and east. The first hour, covering some three miles, lay partly over a flat plain of grass used for thatch, pimpled with red anthills and broken by lines and patches of dense jungle. These savannahs are common near the sea; we had already remarked one behind Béin. They denote the 'false coast,' and they become during the wet season almost impassable swamps and mud-fields.|$|E
6000|$|To those unlearned in the {{economical}} {{institutions of}} antiquity {{it is necessary}} to explain that in ancient America, long prior to the disastrous Japanese war, individual ownership of property was unrestricted; every person was permitted to get as much as he was able, and to hold it as his own without regard to his needs, or whether he made any good use of it or not. By some plan of distribution not now understood even the habitable surface of the earth, with the minerals beneath, was parceled out among the favored few, and there was really no place except at sea where children of the others could lawfully be born. Upon a part of the dry land that {{he had been able to}} acquire, or had leased from another for the purpose, a man would build a house worth, say, ten thousand drusoes. (The ancient <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>value</b> was the [...] "dollar," [...] but nothing is now known as to its actual worth.) Long before the building was complete the owner was beset by [...] "touts" [...] and [...] "cappers" [...] of the insurance game, who poured into his ears the most ingenious expositions of the advantages of betting that it would burn down--for with incredible fatuity the people of that time continued, generation after generation, to build inflammable habitations. The persons whom the capper represented--they called themselves an [...] "insurance company"--stood ready to accept the bet, a fact which seems to have generated no suspicion in the mind of the house-owner. Theoretically, of course, if the house did burn payment of the wager would partly or wholly recoup the winner of the bet for the loss of his house, but in fact the result of the transaction was commonly very different. For the privilege of betting that his property would be destroyed by fire the owner had to pay to the gentleman betting that it would not be, a certain percentage of its value every year, called a [...] "premium." [...] The amount of this was determined by the company, which employed statisticians and actuaries to fix it at such a sum that, according to the law of probabilities, long before the house was [...] "due to burn," [...] the company would have received more than the value of it in premiums. In other words, the owner of the house would himself supply the money to pay his bet, and a good deal more.|$|E

So to assess the function r, we have to ask a question such as: [...] "What probability to win 2 <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>value</b> is equivalent to 1 value?". The latter question is much harder to answer than the former, since it involves [...] "value", which is an abstract quantity.|$|R

However, {{the relationship between the}} <b>unit</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> a product and its capital intensity is not always positive, and is significantly negative in some sectors. Using the results of the relationship between unit values and factor intensities, we also estimate the factor contents of Japan's trade, taking account of differences in the <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> exports and imports. We find that the number of non-production workers and the capital stock embodied in Japan's net exports are under-estimated when differences in unit values are not taken into account. ...|$|R
