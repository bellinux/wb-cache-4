At present, the study on the mechanical properties of <b>unloading</b> rock mass is common, but the research for <b>unloading</b> {{strength properties}} of jointed rock mass, especially the influence of structural plane on <b>unloading</b> strength is seldom. The paper studied the failure characters of <b>unloading</b> rock mass, and the influences of structural plane properties on <b>unloading</b> strength based on triaxial test are considered emphatically. Finally the strength criterion of <b>unloading</b> rock mass is proposed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Grain tank <b>unloading</b> {{is usually}} done at a standstill.

The publication analyses the reasons for <b>unloading</b> grain tanks by leaving the processed strip {{and the impact of}} this type of <b>unloading</b> on the combine productivity compared to <b>unloading</b> the grain tank in the field itself. A study has been performed in Bulgarian farms using different ways of <b>unloading</b> and the results of time measured for <b>unloading</b> grain tanks in {{and at the end of}} the field have been given when harvesting various agricultural crops.

40|$|Particle-reinforced rubbers {{exhibit a}} marked stress {{softening}} during <b>unloading</b> after loading in uniaxial tension tests, i. e. {{the stress on}} <b>unloading</b> is significantly less than that on loading at the same stretch. This hysteretic behaviour is not accounted for when the mechanical. properties are represented {{in terms of a}} strain-energy function, i. e. if the material is modelled as hyperelastic. In this paper a theory of pseudo-elasticity is used to model loading, partial or complete <b>unloading</b> and the subsequent reloading and <b>unloading</b> of reinforced rubber. The basis of the model is the inclusion in the energy function of a variable that enables the energy function to be changed as the deformation path changes between loading, partial <b>unloading,</b> reloading and any further <b>unloading.</b> The dissipation of energy, i. e. the difference between the energy input during loading and the energy returned on <b>unloading</b> is accounted for in the model by the use of a dissipation function, the form of which changes between <b>unloading,</b> reloading and subsequent <b>unloading...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this study, nanoindentation {{technique}} {{was used to}} determine the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) with a glass transition temperature of 29 °C. Nanoindentation was conducted with a Berkovich nanoindenter tip under the same constant loading rate but different <b>unloading</b> rates. The Burgers nonlinear viscoelastic model was implemented in ABAQUS/Standard finite element code by means of a user-defined subroutine. After fitting the complete load-displacement curves, parameters in the nonlinear Maxwell and Voigt elements were obtained to describe the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of PVAc. The results show that PVAc exhibits negative <b>unloading</b> stiffness under low <b>unloading</b> rates. However, if the <b>unloading</b> rate is higher than 0. 1 mN/s, PVAc appears more elastic behavior. The nonlinear Burgers model used can successfully model the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of PVAc at different <b>unloading</b> rates, including the <b>unloading</b> nose associated with negative <b>unloading</b> slope at slow <b>unloading</b> rate for a highly viscoelastic material...|$|R

While the LSTs were <b>unloaded</b> quickly enough, the seven bulk loaded LCTs were not, due to insufficient troops being designated to help unloading. The last was not <b>unloaded</b> until 14:30.

On the evening of May 9, 1768, Hancock's sloop Liberty arrived in Boston Harbor, carrying a shipment of Madeira wine. When custom officers inspected the ship the next morning, they found that it contained 25 pipes of wine, just one fourth of the ship's carrying capacity. Hancock paid the duties on the 25 pipes of wine, but officials suspected that he had arranged to have more wine <b>unloaded</b> during the night to avoid paying the duties for the entire cargo. They did not have any evidence to prove this, however, since the two tidesmen who had stayed on the ship overnight gave a sworn statement that nothing had been <b>unloaded.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{dislocation}} climb on plastic deformation during loading and <b>unloading</b> are studied using a two-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics model. Simulations are performed for polycrystalline thin films passivated on both surfaces. Dislocation climb lowers the {{overall level of}} the stress inside thin films and reduces the work hardening rate. Climb decreases the density of dislocations in pile-ups and reduces back stresses. These factors result in a smaller Bauschinger effect on <b>unloading</b> compared to simulations without climb. As dislocations continue to climb {{at the onset of}} <b>unloading</b> and the dislocation density continues to increase, the initial <b>unloading</b> slope increases with decreasing <b>unloading</b> rate. Because climb disperses dislocations, fewer dislocations are annihilated during <b>unloading,</b> leading to a higher dislocation density {{at the end of the}} <b>unloading</b> step.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a hierarchical and simultaneous gravity <b>unloading</b> method. An air bearing gravity <b>unloading</b> facility for two-orthogonal-axis {{antenna pointing mechanism}} (APM) is designed based on this method. This method is proposed based on the characteristics analysis of the two-orthogonal-axis APM and air bearings. The mechanism of the hierarchical and simultaneous gravity <b>unloading</b> method is described in detail. It solves the coupling problem of two axes and <b>unloads</b> the gravity of both joints hierarchically and simultaneously. The air bearing gravity <b>unloading</b> facility which is a structure mechanism with two layers based on this method is designed with planar air bearing and air spindle. The structure of the facility is described in detail. The dynamic models of the APM with its load in space environment and on the air bearing gravity <b>unloading</b> facility are derived respectively. With the analysing of the driving torques and vertical forces of the APM joints in both models, the results demonstrate that the gravity <b>unloading</b> facility can simulate the microgravity environment successfully. This conclusion is also proved by the dynamic simulation with ADAMS software. The simulation also provides some optimization targets for the gravity <b>unloading</b> facility. At last, the gravity <b>unloading</b> facility is established and some experiments are done. The dynamic models, the simulation results and the experiments all show {{the effectiveness of the}} hierarchical and simultaneous gravity <b>unloading</b> method...|$|R

In this study, the speed can be classified into three regions in text: the low speed region of <b>unload</b> confining pressure, the intermediate speed region and the high speed region.
