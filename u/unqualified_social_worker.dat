40|$|This Bachelor thesis {{deals with}} the {{everyday}} ethics of <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> in {{the expectations of the}} clients. The theoretical part is based on the knowledge obtained from the literature and electronic resources, which write about current society, ethics, <b>social</b> work, <b>social</b> <b>worker,</b> client of <b>social</b> services. quality of social work, economization, legislation, and stress in social work, supervision, role of the <b>social</b> <b>worker,</b> expectations by <b>social</b> <b>workers,</b> relationship between a <b>social</b> <b>worker</b> and client etc. The goal of this work is to find out what are the expectations of the clients of social services in relation to <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> {{and at the same time}} to gain awareness about how <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> deal with these expectations on a daily basis. Set out the four research questions: Which ideas do clients have about the <b>social</b> <b>worker</b> profession? What do most clients expect from a <b>social</b> <b>worker?</b> How do <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> perceive ethics in their work? How can stress affect the work of <b>social</b> <b>workers?</b> For obtaining the data qualitative research was chosen. Specifically the techniques were used semi-controlled interview with open and closed questions with active listening technique and participatory observation technique. Research probe consists of accidentally selected <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> and clients of social services in the district of Pisek. For the purpose of research was addressed 22 <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> and 18 clients of social organizations and institutions. The data was analyzed using the methods of scoring. The empirical part will focus on the expectations of the clients of <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> [...] The results shows that the expectations of the clients are very diverse, according to the social services, which they require. For example the six clients expect that the <b>social</b> <b>worker</b> can advise them with the resolution of their situation. Clients of social services require a suitable job or increase <b>social</b> benefits by <b>workers</b> at the Office. Almost all users of residential services require space and time for the interview. The results also shows that the all <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> perceive ethics during their work. Stress in difficult situations was felt by 10 <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> interviewed, mostly in a troubled situations. In my opinion there is a need for more and better way of informing the public about the profession of a <b>social</b> <b>worker.</b> When the public will know what they can expect by <b>social</b> <b>workers,</b> then <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> may recieve a feedback. The task of this work is not to submit clear explanations examined by the facts, but rather to convey readers a preview of everyday ethics in the practice of <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> and to find out what clients expect the most from <b>social</b> <b>workers.</b> This thesis work I would like to contribute to the larger preview on the issue.

To get our results we based our study on interviews whit four foster homes and whit four <b>social</b> <b>workers.</b> The analysis was based on one theoretical perspective, Skaus (2007) analytical approach for power and help. As a conclusion we have found out, that the organization of the Social Service has significance for the contact between <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> and foster homes.

The co-worker of the <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> is important when it comes to the handling of emotions.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} dissertation is social work field education in New Zealand. The purpose of conducting {{the study was to}} ascertain how both students and field educators experienced teaching and learning in the field. Results indicate that while teaching and learning thinking and theory have evolved in recent years to include a critical reflective dimension, the practice of field education is still largely based on an apprenticeship model. Practice experience and theoretical input relating to areas of societal inequality as well as the political context in which field education is delivered explain the continued use of the apprenticeship model. Students and field educators do, however, share a vision for how field education should be delivered. They agree on the attributes of an effective field educator, and on the methods needed to enhance practice teaching and learning. The research has, nevertheless, identified a discrepancy between this shared vision for field education and the reality that students experience in the field. Field educators are clearly marginalised in their role. Their work as educators is not sanctioned or recognised by employing agencies, and workload pressure frequently militates against <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> being able to accommodate students on placement. In this climate a minimalist approach to field education is adopted, resulting in <b>unqualified</b> <b>social</b> work staff and people who are not <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> acting as field educators. Without radical shifts in the recognition, resourcing and organisation of field education, student learning in the field will continue to be compromised.

40|$|Our main aim {{with this}} study is to shed a light over the <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> {{opinions}} about what they believe will be the consequences of introducing Housing First in the city of Stockholm. We wanted to examine the <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> perceptions about how Housing First could change their client’s autonomy and justice. Therefor we accomplished five qualitative interviews with <b>social</b> <b>workers.</b> We analyzed our empirical material with the theoretical terms; justice, autonomy and intern role-conflict. The results and analysis showed that the <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> considered that their client’s autonomy and justice increases by the Housing First model. We also found that Housing First seems to reduce the <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> intern role-conflict. We found that the reason might be {{that they do not have}} to choose between different expectations in the same extent as when they work with the continuum of care model. The result also showed that the <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> believed that the more independent the clients are towards the social services and the <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> demands, the more dependent the clients become towards the <b>social</b> <b>workers,</b> by the means of motivation work. ...|$|R

The purpose of the study is to understand how <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> try to motivate the individuals to stop abuse cannabis. I have chosen to do interviews with five <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> in five different municipalities in southern Sweden. This is a qualitative study where the starting point is to understand how the <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> and their motivating work affects the individual. The results of the study showed that all <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> used Motivational Interviews on a regular basis. There were also differences between <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> own subjective views on the factors that influence motivation work. One weakness of the study is that the current LVM care have not had any cannabis addicted individuals that have been to any <b>social</b> <b>worker,</b> which I supposed. The conclusion that can be said is that all <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> implied that motivational work is important to strengthen the individual and for the individual to increase their chances to quit the abuse...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze, {{describe}} and explain the relationship between role ambiguity and burnout of <b>social</b> <b>workers.</b> Also, the study was designed to determine the best predictor of role ambiguity and burnout of <b>social</b> <b>workers.</b> Survey research was employed in a metropolitan area involving randomly selected samples of 158 <b>social</b> <b>worker</b> respondents compiled from a list of National Association of <b>Social</b> <b>workers</b> (NASW), National Association of Black <b>Social</b> <b>Worker</b> (NABSW) and Clark Atlanta University School of Social Work. The questionnaire employed one section from two instruments. The emotional exhaustion section of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the role ambiguity section of the Rizzo’s Role Perception Questionnaire. The findings of the study indicated a statistically significant relationship between burnout and role ambiguity among <b>social</b> <b>workers.</b> The majority of the <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> agreed that they experienced burnout and a majority disagreed that they experienced role ambiguity in the workplace. The study indicated that the best predictor of role ambiguity and burnout for <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> was the independent variable current job satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore Connecticut {{professional}} <b>Social</b> <b>Workers</b> 2 ̆ 7 (i. e., Clinical <b>Social</b> <b>Workers</b> and School <b>Social</b> <b>Workers)</b> and Counselors 2 ̆ 7 (i. e., Mental Health Counselors and School Counselors) attitudes toward persons with the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). ^ AIDS presents a challenge to both <b>Social</b> <b>Workers</b> and Counselors, not only in terms of what can be done on behalf of clients, but also how to respond professionally (Wexler, 1989). Therefore, this study utilized a quantitative research methodology (and the AIDS Attitude Scale) to investigate professional <b>Social</b> <b>Workers</b> 2 ̆ 7 and Counselors 2 ̆ 7 self-report measures of their empathy and avoidance attitudes toward persons with AIDS. ^ One hundred and twenty (120) study participants were randomly selected from the membership list of each of these professional associations, i. e., thirty participants selected from each of the four professional associations (N = 120). Each participant (Clinical <b>Social</b> <b>Workers,</b> School <b>Social</b> <b>Workers,</b> Mental Health Counselors, and School Counselors) was mailed a copy of the AIDS Attitude Scale, a consent to participate letter, and a stamped self-addressed envelope. ^ There was a statistically significant difference among Mental Health Counselors, Clinical <b>Social</b> <b>Workers,</b> School Counselors, and School <b>Social</b> <b>Workers,</b> as measured by the Empathy sub-scale of the AIDS Attitude Scale (AAS). The results from the ANOVA and Tukey HSD Post Hoc Test determined that the statistically significant difference was between Clinical <b>Social</b> <b>Workers</b> and School Counselors with regard to the variable empathy (F [3, 89] = 2. 583, p 3 ̆c. 05). Hence, Clinical <b>Social</b> <b>Workers</b> had statistically significant higher empathy scores. ^ ANOVA procedures indicated statistical significance for the dependent variables as follows: (1) “Years experience in profession” between School <b>Social</b> <b>Workers</b> and Mental Health Counselors (F [3, 89] = 3. 307, p 3 ̆c. 05). School <b>Social</b> <b>Workers</b> had statistically significant higher years of experience in the profession, and (2) “Know someone with AIDS” between Clinical <b>Social</b> <b>Workers</b> and School Counselors (F [3, 82] = 4. 245, p 3 ̆c. 05).
