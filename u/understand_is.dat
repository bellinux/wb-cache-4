500|$|Arriving in Japan at {{the village}} of Tomogi, the priests are dismayed to find local Christian populations driven underground. Both priests are then shocked when a samurai searching for {{suspected}} Christians, whom the villagers {{refer to as the}} [...] "Inquisitor", straps some of the villagers to wooden crosses by the ocean shore, where the tide eventually drowns them. The bodies are then cremated on a funeral pyre which the priests <b>understand</b> <b>is</b> done to prevent a Christian burial.|$|E
500|$|What is {{important}} to <b>understand</b> <b>is</b> what exactly Locke means when he advises parents to treat their children as reasoning beings. Locke first highlights that children [...] "love {{to be treated as}} Rational Creatures," [...] thus parents should treat them as such. Tarcov argues that this suggests children can be considered rational only in that they respond to the desire to be treated as reasoning creatures and that they are [...] "motivated only [...] rewards and punishments" [...] to achieve that goal.|$|E

500|$|Facing the Yankees in the 1963 World Series, Koufax beat Whitey Ford 5–2 in Game 1 {{and struck}} out 15 batters-including the first 5, {{breaking}} Carl Erskine's decade-old record of 14 (Gibson would break Koufax's record by striking out 17 Detroit Tigers in the 1968 World Series opener). After seeing Koufax's Game 1 performance, Yogi Berra said, [...] "I can see how he won 25 games. What I don't <b>understand</b> <b>is</b> how he lost five," [...] to which Maury Wills responded, [...] "He didn't. We lost them for him." [...] In Game 4, Koufax completed the Dodgers' series sweep with a 2–1 victory over Ford, clinching the Series MVP Award for his performance.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{continuing}} {{debates about}} authorship, {{the work is}} almost always treated as Monteverdi's—although Rosand observes that some scholars attribute it to [...] "Monteverdi" [...] (in quotation marks). Ringer calls the opera [...] "Monteverdi's last and arguably greatest work," [...] a unified masterpiece of [...] "unprecedented depth and individuality". Carter observes how Monteverdi's operas redefined the boundaries of theatrical music, and calls his contribution to 17th-century Venetian opera [...] "remarkable by any standard". Harnoncourt reflects thus: [...] "What is difficult to <b>understand...</b> <b>is</b> the mental freshness with which the 74-year-old composer, two years before his death, was able to surpass his pupils in the most modern style and to set standards which were {{to apply to the}} music theatre of the succeeding centuries." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Within" [...] {{was one of}} {{the first}} tracks to be {{recorded}} for the album. It features Gonzales on piano with minimal accompaniment consisting of bass and a percussion track, as well as vocoder. In the context of the album, [...] "Within" [...] marks the transition from the key of A minor of the previous three songs, to the key of B-flat minor of subsequent tracks. Regarding the lyrics, critic Nick Stevenson observed, [...] "A deep vocoder sings about not understanding the world, being lost and not even remembering his own name." [...] Jeremy Abbott of Mixmag added, [...] "So many things I don't <b>understand</b> <b>is</b> the prominent lyric and Chilly's chords combined with grazing cymbals make for a beautiful summer lullaby." ...|$|E

500|$|It's Better If You Don't <b>Understand</b> <b>is</b> {{the debut}} EP by American singer Bruno Mars. Its title {{comes from the}} final lyrics {{of one of its}} songs, [...] "The Other Side". The EP {{consists}} of four tracks and incorporates pop, pop rock, and hip hop music genres. The record was made available for digital download on May 11, 2010 by Elektra Records in the United States, and on August 11, 2010 by Atlantic Records in France. The song [...] "Count on Me" [...] was not featured on the track list of the latter release. To promote the album, Mars released a home video for the recording [...] "The Other Side". All of the material on the EP was produced by The Smeezingtons members Mars, Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine, with the closing track being co-produced by Jeff Bhasker.|$|E
500|$|Another {{issue that}} has been {{difficult}} to <b>understand</b> <b>is</b> how they took off. Earlier suggestions were that pterosaurs were largely cold-blooded gliding animals, deriving warmth from the environment like modern lizards, rather than burning calories. In this case, it was unclear how the larger ones of enormous size, with an inefficient cold-blooded metabolism, could manage a bird-like takeoff strategy, using only the hind limbs to generate thrust for getting airborne. Later research shows them instead as being warm-blooded and having powerful flight muscles, and using the flight muscles for walking as quadrupeds. Mark Witton of the University of Portsmouth and Mike Habib of Johns Hopkins University suggested that pterosaurs used a vaulting mechanism to obtain flight. The tremendous power of their winged forelimbs would enable them to take off with ease. Once aloft, pterosaurs could reach speeds of up to [...] and travel thousands of kilometres.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} when describing Chi's character, Clamp member Satsuki Igarashi stated [...] "Lately we've {{been saying that}} the easiest to <b>understand</b> <b>is</b> Chii from 'Chobits.' Errors occur with computers. Things like 'Although it's fine to speak the instructions' and 'Please fix this problem here' might be spoken in a cute voice." [...] In addition, an explanation for Chobitss plot was given by Igarashi who stated: [...] "Back then, when our computer had problems all we would get were these inscrutable error messages. However, {{we had no idea}} what was wrong because it wouldn't tell us any more". Clamp also describes Chobits as a variation of the [...] "boy living with mysterious girl" [...] genre. Chi's design as a personal computer resulted from Ohkawa's wish to increase the sense of [...] "emotional discomfort" [...] around becoming emotionally involved with something considered to be merely a lifeless machine.|$|E

500|$|In January 2005, Ferguson and Wenger were {{embroiled in}} a new row over what had {{happened}} in the tunnel after Pizzagate. Ferguson alleged that Wenger called his players [...] "cheats" [...] and never apologised for his team's behaviour: [...] "It's a disgrace, but I don't expect Wenger to ever apologise, he's that type of person." [...] Wenger then claimed Ferguson was guilty of bringing the game into disrepute; he told reporters that he [...] "will never answer any questions any more about this man," [...] but went further to question the motive of the press: [...] "What I don't <b>understand</b> <b>is</b> that he does what he wants and you are all at his feet." [...] Both managers came under pressure from the Metropolitan Police Service, then Sports Minister Richard Caborn and Premier League chairman Richard Scudamore {{to put an end to}} the bickering. Ferguson and Wenger agreed to tone down their words, in an attempt to defuse the rivalry. In later years, Ferguson said Arsenal's defeat [...] "scrambled Arsène’s brain" [...] and caused their relationship to breakdown for almost five years.|$|E
500|$|It's Better If You Don't <b>Understand</b> <b>is</b> {{composed}} of four songs employing pop, pop rock, and hip hop genres. Mars {{explained that the}} EP is hard to classify since: [...] "I just write songs that I strongly believe in and that are coming from inside. There's no tricks. It's honesty with big melodies. And I'm singing the s*** out of them". Labeled as a [...] "romantic croon", the opening track, [...] "Somewhere in Brooklyn", was composed by The Smeezingtons. It features [...] "an emo-pop backing" [...] beat, a piano and synthesizers. Lyrically, the tune is about Mars chasing the [...] "perfect woman" [...] who got away, and wishing to find her again. The second release, [...] "The Other Side", features a vocal collaboration with Cee Lo Green and B.o.B., and is considered the best on the EP by some critics. The track {{has been described as}} incorporating 60's and 70's soulful feeling. Its instrumentation uses guitar, organ and a: [...] "drum and bass pace that slowly builds through the verse and into the chorus". It is reminiscent of compositions by Daniel Merriweather and Chris Isaak’s [...] "Wicked Game". [...] "The Other Side" [...] shows Mars' darker side has a [...] "soaring pop" [...] hook.|$|E
500|$|The writer Michael Steinberg {{described}} the symphony's success as essentially {{a phenomenon of}} the compact disc, and while live performances are still given, they do not always sell out. Some critics, wondering at the sudden success of the piece nearly two decades after its composition, suggest that it resonated with a particular mood in the popular culture at the time. Stephen Johnson, writing in A guide to the symphony, wondered whether the commercial success of the work was [...] "a flash in the pan" [...] or {{would turn out to}} have lasting significance. In 1998, the critic Michael Steinberg asked, [...] " [...] really listening to this symphony? How many CD buyers discover that fifty-four minutes of very slow music with a little singing in a language they don't <b>understand</b> <b>is</b> more than they want? Is it being played as background music to Chardonnay and brie?" [...] Steinberg compared the success of Górecki's symphony to the Doctor Zhivago phenomenon of 1958: [...] "Everybody rushed to buy the book; few managed actually to read it. The appearance of the movie in 1965 rescued us all from the necessity." [...] Górecki was as surprised as anyone else at the recording's success, and later speculated that [...] "perhaps people find something they need in this piece of music…. Somehow I hit the right note, something they were missing. Something, somewhere had been lost to them. I feel that I instinctively knew what they needed." ...|$|E
