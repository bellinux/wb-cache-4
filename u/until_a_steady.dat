5000|$|Lighting an Australian [...] "choofer" [...] is {{a tricky}} business. Because of the voluminous clouds of oily black smoke they produce when cold, they must be lit outside. This is {{accomplished}} by holding a burning rag next to the open damper on the fuel tank. The draught caused by the breeze passing through the chimney will draw air through the open damper into the fuel tank, where {{the surface of the}} fuel inside will light and burn instantly. Once the choofer is sufficiently warm, the damper may be closed <b>until</b> <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> rate of burning is attained, when the characteristic [...] "choofa choofa choofa" [...] noise is produced. If the damper is not closed, the choofa may choke itself with its own smoke, causing periodic [...] "explosions" [...] of unburnt gases in the chimney. Such explosions are not dangerous, but they are noisy and they produce a lot of smoke. Once the heater is burning hot enough, the smoke will disappear and the pot may be dragged slowly and carefully inside. They still produce dangerous gas, and must only be used in well-ventilated spaces.|$|E
5000|$|Solid lipid {{nanoparticles}} preparate {{has been}} developed for cosmetics where the curcuminoids are used in cream base. But there are some stability issues which have not been overcome yet, further studies {{need to be done}} to find a suitable formulation which can be carried out in order to prolong the stability of the curcuminoids. Nevertheless, there have been improvements in formulation of some stable model cream preparations with SLN curcuminoids. It is suggested that most of the curcuminoids are incorporated at the SLN surface where they are diffused into the cream matrix <b>until</b> <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> state is reached. At this state the curcuminoids go from the cream to the dissolution medium. A possible burst release in creams containing curcuminoids have been reported where the curcuminoids are rapidly released in a sufficient amount from the cream into the skin and is followed by a controlled release.When SLN are prepared by microemulsion at a temperature with the range of 70-75 °C an oil-in-water microemulsion is spontaneously formed. The SLN are obtained immediately when they are [...] in the warm microemulsion into cold water, {{with the help of a}} homogenizer. The cold water facilitates a rapid crystallization of the lipids and therefore prevents aggregation of the lipids. After freeze drying the yellow curcuminoids containing SLN were obtained and could easily be redispersed in water and the model cream. The SLN have uniform distribution and according to electron micrograph scan they had a spherical shape and smooth surface.It has been reported that increasing the lipid content over 5-10%(w/w) increased the mean particle size and broader size distribution in most common cases. That range should there for be ideal concentration for formulation of the SLN.|$|E
