500|$|Edwards {{opted to}} remain at Accrington ahead of the 2007–08 season, signing a {{contract}} extension in May 2007. He played his {{first game of the}} campaign in late August 2007, a 2–0 defeat at Lincoln City. Following Accrington's 4–1 home win against Grimsby Town in September 2007, a game in which Edwards appeared as a 90th-minute substitute, he did not feature in the first-team for two months. He returned to first-team action on 17 November 2007, playing in the club's 1–0 home defeat to Rotherham United. Following a spate of late substitute appearances, Edwards was ever present in the first-team from December 2007 onwards. He scored his first goal of the 2007–08 season on 4 April 2008, scoring the winner in a 1–0 win against Dagenham & Redbridge. The goal all but guaranteed League Two survival for Accrington. It was Edwards' only goal of the season, playing 32 games in all competitions. Edwards started in Accrington's first game of the 2008–09 season, a 1–0 home loss to newly promoted Aldershot Town. In October 2008, Accrington manager John Coleman praised Edwards for his form during the start of the season, [...] "I couldn't pay him enough compliments. I think the last six months he has been absolutely magnificent. I am convinced if he was three inches bigger he would be playing in the Premier League. He is our best defender and hopefully he'll continue to be a great player for <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time". Edwards remained ever present in the Accrington first-team, but was taken off after 17 minutes in Accrington's 2–1 win against Shrewsbury Town. Despite needing eight stitches in his knee, Edwards played in Accrington's following league match four days later, a 1–0 home defeat to Wycombe Wanderers. He provided the assist for Paul Mullin's goal in a defeat at Wycombe Wanderers, as well as assisting Jamie Clarke's second goal in a 3–1 home win over Grimsby Town. Edwards played in every one of Accrington's 50 games during the 2008–09 season, with the club finishing 16th in the league table.|$|E
2500|$|Both Kim Kye-gwan for North Korea and Christopher Hill for the U.S. made {{positive}} {{remarks about}} the progress of in-between-rounds one-to-one talks held from Tuesday 16 January 2007 to Thursday 18 January 2007 in Berlin, Germany, pointing to [...] "certain agreements" [...] being reached. [...] They met for six hours on Tuesday and {{one and a half}} hours on Wednesday. [...] North Korea has viewed these talks as the [...] "bilateral negotiations" [...] it has wanted with the <b>U.S.</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time, whereas the U.S. refers to it as talks in [...] "preparation for the six-party talks".|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on 15 November 2010. In addition, Egan fully expressed what he felt on during recording Gravity: [...] "It’s hard to believe this is our 11th album but performing is our passion and it would seem like throwing it all away if we stopped."“Both us and Take That go for epic pop songs but them taking Robbie back hasn’t made us think about Brian McFadden returning. It would feel odd to have a fifth person back on stage with us". In addition Westlife told Digital Spy: [...] "We'd {{wanted to work with}} him for a long time, but all his loyalty was to Take That and he didn't want to work with another boyband," [...] "We'd been asking him and asking, but literally within moments of Take That deciding to go and work with Stuart Price, he said yes to us straight away. Afterwards he said he'd wanted to work with <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time, but he just couldn't do the Take That thing and the Westlife thing because they were too close." [...] "John created a sound for us in the same way he created a sound for Take That, a sound for Bon Jovi and a sound for all the other incredible artists he's worked with," [...] "He created a sound for Westlife that we haven't had before - it's not a massive departure, but it's definitely a step up in terms of production." [...] Filan also revealed that the group is currently in the process of selecting 12 or 13 songs for the album's final track listing from a pool of 16, with all but [...] "one or two" [...] likely to be originals. On 22 October 2010, Shanks stated that they have finished the Westlife record, all approved by Cowell. Shanks stated that the album ended up with two covers in it. On 27 October 2010, the album main release date was changed to 22 November 2010. On 25 October 2010, Feehily unveiled the final track listing on his official Twitter page as follows: On 1 November 2010, Mark confirmed the two cover songs on the album are, [...] "Chances" [...] by Athlete and [...] "The Reason" [...] by Hoobastank. In the November 2010 issue of Hello Magazine they told them about their competition with Take That and Walsh and Cowell's involvement in the album, [...] "You need competition to keep you on your toes".|$|E

60|$|At first Mr. Bessel's {{mental state}} was an unemotional wonder. His thought chiefly {{concerned}} itself with {{where he might}} be.

She spent her time tending her child and praying to God; and we sailors, who are rough, you know--but who know that God protects us, and never go for a long voyage without going to the chapel and paying for a mass for our safety--we prayed too, and the third morning there were three turtles asleep on the shore.
