40|$|The {{two major}} {{lithology}} or gneiss {{components in the}} polycyclic granulite terrain of the Eastern Ghats, India, are the supracrustal rocks, commonly described as khondalites, and the charnockite-gneiss. Many of the workers considered the khondalites as the oldest component with unknown basement and the charnockite-protoliths as intrusive into the khondalites. However, geochronological data do not corroborate the aforesaid relations. The field relations of the hornblende- mafic granulite with the two gneiss components together with geocronological data indicate that khondalite sediments were deposited on older mafic crustal rocks. We propose a different scenario: Mafic basement and supracrustal rocks were subsequently deformed and metamorphosed together at high to <b>ultra-high</b> <b>temperatures</b> – partial melting of mafic rocks producing the charnockitic melt; and partial melting of pelitic sediments producing the peraluminous granitoids.

40|$|Two {{petrographic}} {{types of}} rutile are {{observed in the}} peraluminous felsic meta-igneous granulites, {{the most common type}} of the lower crustal xenolith suite of the Spanish Central System (SCS). Rutile- 1 (Rt- 1) corresponds to small crystals (mainly < 80 mm) only preserved as micro-inclusions within garnet, whereas rutile- 2 (Rt- 2) is commonly found as big idiomorfic crystals forming the granulite granoblastic matrix. Chemical analyses by EMP show a higher Zr content in Rt- 1 (up to 7800 ppm) than in Rt- 2 (up to 5200 ppm) of the same granulite. Applying Zr-in-rutile thermometry, Rt- 1 gives 50 - 60 ºC higher for rutile crystallization (950 - 1015 ºC) when compared to Rt- 2 thermometry (940 - 955 ºC).

50|$|Recently, newer radiatively-cooled TPS {{materials}} {{have been developed}} that could be superior to RCC. Known as <b>Ultra-High</b> <b>Temperature</b> Ceramics, they were developed for the prototype vehicle Slender Hypervelocity Aerothermodynamic Research Probe (SHARP). These TPS materials are based on zirconium diboride and hafnium diboride. SHARP TPS have suggested performance improvements allowing for sustained Mach 7 flight at sea level, Mach 11 flight at 100000 ft altitudes, and significant improvements for vehicles designed for continuous hypersonic flight. SHARP TPS materials enable sharp leading edges and nose cones to greatly reduce drag for airbreathing combined-cycle-propelled spaceplanes and lifting bodies. SHARP {{materials have}} exhibited effective TPS characteristics from zero to more than 2,000 °C, with melting points over 3,500 °C.

40|$|It {{is shown}} on {{a basis of}} {{generalization}} of lateral and vertical distribution of P-T parameters in granulite-gneiss belts of various ages that the thermal gradient within the lower crust during granulite metamorphism is rather low, ca. 5 - 10 ℃/km. Two extreme types of granulitic crustal sections are recognized. First type (GM 1) corresponds to normal and especially to thinned (25 - 40 km) crust. High and <b>ultra-high</b> <b>temperatures</b> (up to 1050 ℃) are characteristic for the deepest granulites of this type. Second type (GM 2) corresponds to thickened (50 - 55 km) crust. It is characterized by moderately high temperatures in the lower crust (from 700 - 800 ℃ at crust-mantle boundary). GM 1 is generally connected with settings related to the hot mantle upwelling to crust-mantle boundary accompanied by heat and penetrating fluid fluxes and crustal extension or crustal thinning. Maximal heating is characteristic for the most thinned crust, i. e., for riftogenic environment including extension zones in back areas of active continental margins and in the crust of epi-continental sedimentary basins.

Pasteurized skim milk was concentrated to 3 X by ultrafiltration. In the pH study portions of skim milk retentate were adjusted to pH 6. 38 ±. 02 with HCl and 6. 85 ±. 01 and 7. 32 ±. 02 with NaOH between ultrafiltration and <b>ultra-high</b> <b>temperature</b> processing. In the storage temperature study, storage temperatures used for pH-unadjusted retentate samples were 11 °C, 23 °C (room temperature), and 37 °C. Although pH 6. 38 samples had the lowest viscosity in the pH study before <b>ultra-high</b> <b>temperature</b> processing, these samples precipitated during <b>ultra-high</b> <b>temperature</b> processing. For non-acidified samples, increasing pH of retentate resulted in higher viscosities and quicker age gelation times. Destabilization occurred more rapidly at 37 °C than at 23 °C or 11 °C. The pH drop tended to be greater for samples stored at a higher temperature or adjusted to a higher pH. During 28 weeks of 37 °C storage the pH decreased from 6. 54 to 6. 06.
