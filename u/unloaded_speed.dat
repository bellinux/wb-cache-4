50|$|The {{flywheel}} is a disk or wheel {{attached to}} the crank, forming an inertial mass that stores rotational energy. In engines with only a single cylinder the flywheel is essential to carry energy over from the power stroke into a subsequent compression stroke. Flywheels are present in most reciprocating engines to smooth out the power delivery over each rotation of the crank and in most automotive engines also mount a gear ring for a starter. The rotational inertia of the flywheel also allows a much slower minimum <b>unloaded</b> <b>speed</b> and also improves the smoothness at idle. The flywheel may also perform {{a part of the}} balancing of the system and so by itself be out of balance, although most engines will use a neutral balance for the flywheel, enabling it to be balanced in a separate operation. The flywheel is also used as a mounting for the clutch or a torque converter in most automotive applications.|$|E

40|$|AbstractF 1 -ATPase is an ATP-driven rotary {{molecular}} motor {{in which the}} central γ-subunit rotates inside a cylinder made of α 3 β 3 subunits. The amino and carboxyl termini of the γ rotor form a coiled coil of α-helices that penetrates the stator cylinder {{to serve as an}} axle. Crystal structures indicate that the axle is supported by the stator at two positions, at the orifice and by the hydrophobic sleeve surrounding the axle tip. The sleeve contacts are almost exclusively to the longer carboxyl-terminal helix, whereas nearly half the orifice contacts are to the amino-terminal helix. Here, we truncated the amino-terminal helix stepwise up to 50 residues, removing one half of the axle all the way up and far beyond the orifice. The half-sliced axle still rotated with an <b>unloaded</b> <b>speed</b> a quarter of the wild-type speed, with torque nearly half the wild-type torque. The truncations were made in a construct where the rotor tip was connected to a β-subunit via a short peptide linker. Linking alone did not change the rotational characteristics significantly. These and previous results show that nearly half the normal torque is generated if rotor-stator interactions either at the orifice or at the sleeve are preserved, suggesting that the make of the motor is quite robust...|$|E

Journal of Animal Science, 94, 78 - 78. doi: 10. 2527 /msasas 2016 - 166 Two experiments were conducted at a commercial feed mill and 6 commercial wean to finish pig sites {{to determine the}} effects of feed truck unloading auger RPM on pellet quality and unloading time, and the effects of feed line location on pellet quality and nutrient concentration of intact pellets and their fines. In Exp. 1, pelleted feed was <b>unloaded</b> using 3 <b>speeds</b> (900, 1150, and 1400 RPM) from each of 8 compartments of a feed truck (Walinga Inc., Guelph, ON, Canada). Six samples per compartment were collected creating 16 replications/unloading speed. There was an <b>unloading</b> <b>speed</b> × trailer compartment interaction (P = 0. 031; SEM = 17. 4). The difference in unloading time from the front to rear compartment was greatest at the slowest <b>unloading</b> <b>speed</b> and similar at the 2 highest <b>unloading</b> <b>speeds</b> (70 vs. 35 and 37 s). The percentage of fines formed during unloading was not influenced by <b>unloading</b> <b>speed,</b> but tended to increase (quadratic; P = 0. 081; SEM = 2. 27) from the front (8. 2 %) to the rear compartment (10. 7 %). In Exp. 2, pelleted feed samples were collected during unloading into a commercial feed bin at 6 finishing pig sites with 2 feed lines, resulting in 12 replications per feed line location. Samples were collected from the feed line at 6, 35, and 76 m from the feed bin. There were no interactions between feed line location and nutrient profile of the fines and pellets. There was no effect of feed line location on pellet durability index, percentage fines, percentage fines formed, or the nutrient profile of pellets or fines. Across locations, fines had decreased (P < 0. 05) CP (12. 4 vs. 15. 3 %; SEM = 0. 14) and P (0. 37 vs. 0. 40 %; SEM = 0. 006), but greater (P < 0. 05) ADF (3. 7 vs. 3. 2 %; SEM = 0. 24), crude fiber (2. 7 vs. 2. 2 %; SEM = 0. 09), Ca (0. 47 vs. 0. 44 %; SEM = 0. 012), ether extract (6. 2 vs. 5. 2 %; SEM = 0. 11), and starch (47. 4 vs. 44. 7 %; SEM = 0. 42) for the fines and pellets, respectively. In conclusion, the front compartments closer to the truck cab resulted in fewer fines formed from loading to <b>unloading.</b> Decreasing <b>unloading</b> <b>speed</b> significantly increased the amount of time taken to unload a feed truck but did not alter fines formed. Feeder distance from the bin did not influence fines formation. There were significant differences in nutrient profile between fines and pellets. Understanding the location of fines creation during the feed delivery process may allow for alternative methods to reduce the formation of fines and subsequent nutrient segregation...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine whether Viso (the maximum speed of shortening extrapolated from force-velocity curves) equalled Vu (the <b>unloaded</b> <b>speed</b> of shortening determined by the slack test) in both living fibres from Rana temporaria and mechanically skinned fibres from Rana pipiens. In living fibres (R. temporaria) we obtained improved estimates of Viso by performing force clamps (isotonic) and length ramps (isovelocity) down to very low loads (0. 005 isometric tension, P 0). Force-velocity characteristics determined by force clamps and length ramps were the same. The hyperbolic Hill curves deviated from the force-velocity data at both high and low loads and underestimated Viso by varying degrees. A better estimate of Viso was obtained by linear extrapolation of data at loads from 0. 005 - 0. 02 P 0 and the mean Viso at 7. 5 degrees C was 4. 08 muscle lengths/s +/- 0. 11 (mean +/- S. E., n = 14). Improved estimates of Vu in living fibres were obtained by photographically calibrating the slack test. The mean Vu was 4. 05 muscle lengths/s +/- 0. 13 (mean +/- S. E., n = 14) and the intercept was 0. 0156 fibre lengths (L 0) +/- 0. 0013 (mean +/- S. E., n = 14). The step-ramp photographic method, in which the motor speed is matched to Vu, was developed as an independent way to measure Vu in living fibres. Vu measured in this way agreed well with Vu measured by the slack test. In all living fibres, the improved estimates of Vu agreed well with the improved estimates of Viso. Vu/Viso = 0. 99 +/- 0. 01 (mean +/- S. E., n = 14). In mechanically skinned R. pipiens fibres, force clamps were performed down to loads of 0. 01 mN. The force-velocity curve of the skinned fibres differed in shape {{from that of the}} living fibres. Although there was significant deviation from the Hill equation at low loads, the data at high loads were well fitted by the Hill curve. Viso determined by extrapolating the Hill equation to zero load was 5. 87 muscle lengths/s +/- 0. 38 (mean +/- S. E., n = 9) at 7. 5 degrees C. In five fibres, the linear extrapolation of low loads (0. 01 - 0. 05 P 0) showed that the Hill equation underestimated the true Viso by 6 %. The slack test with mechanically skinned fibres was calibrated by taking a series of photographic exposures of the fibre at various times following each length step. Vu = 6. 12 muscle lengths/s +/- 0. 44 (mean +/- S. E., n = 10) and the intercept was 0. 0585 L 0 +/- 0. 0069 (mean +/- S. E., n = 10). (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|E

40|$|Measurements of the <b>unloaded</b> sliding <b>speed</b> of and {{isometric}} force exerted on single thin filaments in {{in vitro}} motility assays {{were made to}} evaluate the role of regulatory proteins in the control of unloaded thin filament sliding speed and isometric force production. Regulated actin filaments were reconstituted from rabbit F-actin, native bovine cardiac tropomyosin (nTm), and either native bovine cardiac troponin (nTn), troponin containing a TnC mutant, CBMII, in which the sole regulatory site in cardiac TnC (site II) is inactivated (CBMII-Tn), or troponin containing a point mutation in TnT (I 79 N, where isoleucine at position 79 is replaced with asparagine) associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC). Addition of regulatory proteins to the thin filament increases both the <b>unloaded</b> sliding <b>speed</b> and the isometric force exerted by myosin heads on the thin filaments. Variation of thin filament activation by varying [Ca 2 +] or the fraction of CBMII/TnC bound to the thin filament at pCa 5, {{had little effect on}} the <b>unloaded</b> filament sliding <b>speed</b> until the fraction of the thin filament containing calcium bound to TnC was less than 0. 15. These results suggest that [Ca 2 +] primarily affects the number of attached and cycling crossbridges. The presence of the FHC TnT mutant increased the thin filament sliding speed but reduced the isometric force that heavy meromyosin exerted on regulated thin filaments. These latter results, together with the increased sliding speed and isometric force seen in the presence of regulatory proteins, suggest that thin filament regulatory proteins exert significant allosteric effects on the interaction of crossbridges with the thin filament...|$|R

Exp. 1 and 2 evaluated wheat sources, particle size, and diet form for finishing pigs. Fine gound hard red winter wheat fed in meal form improved G:F and nutrient digestibility, whereas wheat ground from ~ 700 to 250 µ in pelleted diets did not influence growth or carcass traits. Feeding hard red winter wheat improved ADG and ADFI compared with feeding soft white winter wheat. In Exp. 3, pellet feeding regimens were used to evaluate finishing pig performance and stomach morphology. Feeding pelleted diets improved G:F but increased stomach ulceration and pig removals; however, rotating pellets and meal diets provided an intermediate G:F response with fewer stomach ulcers and pig removals. Experiments 4 to 6 investigated fines formation during pelleted feed manufacturing and delivery. Pellet quality worsened as pellets were transported through the feed mill post pelleting and during delivery. <b>Unloading</b> <b>speed</b> or feed line location had little effect on pellet quality.

30|$|The {{conflicting}} {{findings in}} biomechanical responses, particularly contact time, between studies {{may depend on}} a number of factors, including the magnitude of unloading (e.g., 20 % BWS may produce different results than 60 % BWS), accuracy of <b>unloading,</b> running <b>speed,</b> fitness levels of subjects, treadmill running experience, and more specifically, LBPPT running experience [1, 32]. According to a recent systematic review, the current LBPPT literature suggests that there are non-linear changes in muscle activity with different increments of BWS [1]. Some data indicate certain muscles are not affected until significant increases in BWS occur (e.g., significant differences present at 40 % BWS but not 20 % BWS) [26]. However, other data suggest some muscles experience changes with minimal BWS (i.e., 10 % BWS) but not with further unweighting (i.e., 30 % BWS), while some muscle experience consistent changes with incremental increases in BWS [39, 43]. Additionally, there is evidence of an accommodation effect, such that previous research has shown multiple trials of unweighted running are necessary for reliable measures of metabolic cost to be made [21], and this may be the case with biomechanical characteristics too.|$|R

In sucrose, the fiber width was also compressed, and the attenuation of the rate constant of force redevelopment in this case is consequently attributed to the decrease in interfilament space.

The rotor consists of an axle, a coiled coil of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal α-helices of γ, which deeply penetrates the stator cylinder, and a globular protrusion that juts out from the stator. Previous work has shown that, for a thermophilic F 1, significant portions of the axle can be truncated and the motor still rotates a submicron sized bead duplex, indicating generation of up to half the wild-type (WT) torque. Here, we inquire if any specific interactions between the stator {{and the rest of the}} rotor are needed for the generation of a sizable torque. We truncated the protruding portion of the rotor and replaced part of the remaining axle residues such that every residue of the rotor has been deleted or replaced in this or previous truncation mutants. This protrusionless construct showed an <b>unloaded</b> rotary <b>speed</b> about a quarter of the WT, and generated one-third to one-half of the WT torque. No residue-specific interactions are needed for this much performance. F 1 is so designed that the basic rotor-stator interactions for torque generation and control of catalysis rely solely upon the shape and size of the rotor at very low resolution. Additional tailored interactions augment the torque to allow ATP synthesis under physiological conditions...|$|R

First, using in vitro motility assays, sliding speed decreased nonlinearly with reduced density of heavy meromyosin (HMM) for regulated (and unregulated) F-actin at maximal Ca 2 +. Second, we varied {{the number of}} Ca 2 +-activatable troponin complexes at maximal Ca 2 + using mixtures of recombinant rabbit skeletal troponin (WT sTn) and sTn containing sTnC(D 27 A,D 63 A), a mutant deficient in Ca 2 + binding at both N-terminal, low affinity Ca 2 +-binding sites (xxsTnC-sTn). Sliding speed decreased nonlinearly as the proportion of WT sTn decreased. Speed of regulated thin filaments varied with pCa when filaments contained WT sTn but filaments containing only xxsTnC-sTn did not move. pCa 50 decreased by 0. 12 – 0. 18 when either heavy meromyosin density was reduced to ∼ 60 % or the fraction of Ca 2 +-activatable regulatory units was reduced to ∼ 33 %. Third, we exchanged mixtures of sTnC and xxsTnC into single, permeabilized fibers from rabbit psoas. As the proportion of xxsTnC increased, unloaded shortening velocity decreased nonlinearly at maximal Ca 2 +. These data are consistent with <b>unloaded</b> filament sliding <b>speed</b> being limited {{by the number of}} cycling cross-bridges so that maximal speed is attained with a critical, low level of actomyosin interactions...|$|R
