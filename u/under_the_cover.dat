5|$|After {{this the}} brigade {{continued}} to advance, moving through Ruddenburg and Greven before carrying out {{an attack on}} Osnabruck on 4 April 1945. On the night of 7/8 April they crossed the Weser River in assault boats and <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> of darkness carried out a flanking manoeuvre on the Germans occupying the town of Leese, catching them by surprise.|$|E

5|$|At Nhu's request, Tung was {{reported}} to have been planning an operation <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> of a government-organised student demonstration outside the US Embassy, Saigon. In this plan, Tung's men would assassinate ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. and other key officials among the confusion. Another target was the Buddhist leader Thích Trí Quang, who had been given asylum in the embassy after being targeted in the pagoda raids. According to the plan, Tung's men would then burn down the embassy.|$|E

5|$|In September and October 1945 Europeans and pro-Dutch Eurasians were {{attacked}} {{and killed by}} Indonesian mobs. Ferocious fighting erupted when 6,000 British Indian troops landed in the city. Sukarno and Hatta negotiated a ceasefire between the Republicans and the British forces led by Brigadier Mallaby. Following the killing of Mallaby on 30 October, the British sent more troops into the city from 10 November <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> of air attacks. Although the European forces largely captured the city in three days, the poorly armed Republicans fought on until 29 November and thousands died as the population fled to the countryside.|$|E
5|$|In early July the 2/31st {{commenced}} {{operations to}} the north of Jezzine with the aim of securing the high ground around Amatour and Badarane. On the night of 9/10 July they advanced up steep terrain <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> of a heavy artillery barrage. During the fighting that followed, one of the battalion's members, Private James Gordon, performed the deeds for which he subsequently received the Victoria Cross, crawling forward and single-handedly attacking a French post that was holding up his company's advance.|$|E
5|$|On 13 December, von Frank {{informed}} Potiorek that {{he considered}} it impossible for Austro-Hungarian forces to remain in Belgrade for much longer. As a result, Potiorek ordered the Austro-Hungarian forces {{in the city to}} withdraw. The Austro-Hungarians left Belgrade on 14 and 15 December and retreated back into Austria-Hungary <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> of their river monitors on the Sava and the Danube. The Serbian Army re-entered Belgrade on 15 December and was in full control of the city {{by the end of the}} following day.|$|E

5|$|Prinz Adalbert {{was built}} <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> name Cheops by the French {{shipyard}} of the Arman brothers in Bordeaux. Her sister ship, built <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> name Sphinx, {{was delivered to}} the Confederate Navy and renamed CSS Stonewall. The French emperor, Napoleon III, ordered the Arman brothers to sell Cheops to another navy immediately; Prussia purchased the ship on 25 May 1864. The Second Schleswig War between Denmark and Prussia and its ally Austria delayed delivery of the ship. Cheops was commissioned into the Prussian fleet on 29 October 1865 as Prinz Adalbert. Along with the turret ship , Prinz Adalbert {{was among the first}} armored vessels acquired by the Prussian Navy. The ship was named for Prince Adalbert of Prussia, one of the creators of the German fleet. While conducting trials off Denmark in June 1865, Prinz Adalbert ran aground. During the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, Prinz Adalbert was mobilized in Kiel under the command of Admiral Jachmann, but {{due to the lack of}} opponents in the North and Baltic Seas, the ship remained in the Baltic for the duration of the war.|$|E
5|$|The 21st did {{not reach}} the stone wall on Marye's Heights but took shelter in a very slight {{depression}} in the terrain, remaining pinned in that position until night. <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> of darkness, the regiment retired, only to be ordered to the same spot the next morning, expecting a Confederate counterattack which never came. The regiment lost {{a third of its}} numbers at Frederickburg.|$|E
5|$|The French {{artillery}} {{concealed in}} wooded areas proved more potent than the tanks. The German 1st Panzer Company was {{wiped out by}} French artillery, and pulled back with just one battleworthy tank. The Company retreated <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> of part of the ridge, and moved its single tank back and forth, simulating the presence of many German tanks. Diverted from their success at Gaulier, near Sedan, the 2nd Panzer Company {{was rushed to the}} spot and managed to delay the French armoured advance. The Großdeutschland Infantry Regiment's late arrival tilted the scales. They managed to eliminate the anti-tank lines and entrenched French infantry.|$|E

5|$|The Mirabello group {{engaged the}} Austro-Hungarian cruisers at 07:00, but were heavily outgunned, and instead {{attempted}} to shadow the fleeing cruisers. At 07:45, Rear Admiral Acton's ships encountered the destroyers Csepel and Balaton. After 20 minutes, the Italian destroyers {{were able to}} close {{the distance to the}} Austro-Hungarian ships; the two groups engaged in a short artillery duel before a shot from Csepel struck Aquila and disabled the ship's boilers. By this time, the Austro-Hungarian destroyers were <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> of the coastal batteries at Durazzo, and were able to make good their escape.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} {{began on}} 12 October, when the Kaiser-class battleships engaged the batteries on the Sworbe peninsula. Simultaneously, Moltke, Bayern, and the Königs began firing on the Russian shore batteries at Tagga Bay. Stiff Russian {{resistance in the}} Kassar Wick, the entrance to Moon Sound, slowed the German advance. On 14 October, Kaiser was detached from the bombardment force {{to deal with the}} Russian destroyers holding up the German minesweepers. <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> of Kaisers 30.5cm guns, the German torpedo boats dashed into the Sound. During the ensuing clash, the Russian destroyer Grom was disabled and eventually sunk.|$|E

5|$|A Japanese convoy {{approaching}} Endau {{was detected}} by reconnaissance aircraft on 26 January and was ineffectually attacked multiple times by Allied aircraft as it was landing its troops. The Allies suffered heavy casualties, while the Japanese lost only a single aircraft. The Royal Navy committed two destroyers later that day {{to break up the}} Japanese landings, despite the much larger Japanese escort force. Sailing <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> of darkness, they were able to locate the convoy anchored there without being detected, but could not find the troopships in the darkness. The ships attempted to disengage, but were fired upon by the convoy's escorts and one destroyer was sunk {{in the early morning hours}} of 27 January.|$|E
5|$|After {{resting on}} their arms through the night, the 21st awoke to light {{fighting}} in their front. Over {{the course of}} the morning, Union forces gradually shifted to the left, including the 21st, and it became apparent that the Union right flank had collapsed. Meanwhile, Lee's forces had joined Jackson's and were pressing the Union left flank with a massive and rapid assault. Pope's entire army was soon in retreat. Ferrero's brigade was moved by Brig. Gen. Reno to a position on Henry House Hill to cover the Union retreat along the Centreville Turnpike. The brigade, with the 21st in the center, successfully held off Confederate advances from 7 to , buying critical time for the Union army. Finally, <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> of darkness, the brigade quietly retired across Bull Run. During this defeat for the Union army, the 21st suffered light casualties of seven wounded, or two percent.|$|E
5|$|After {{this the}} brigade {{continued}} to advance, moving through Ruddenburg and Greven before carrying out {{an attack on}} Osnabruck, which No. 3 Commando led, on 4 April 1945. The next day, they crossed the Weser River in assault boats and <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> of darkness carried out a flanking manoeuvre on the Germans occupying the town of Leese. As other elements from the brigade attacked from the east, No. 3 Commando, now {{under the command of}} Peter Bartholomew after Komrower had been posted to the Commando Training Depot, carried out a follow-up operation to the north. The operation was an attack on a factory that had been producing V-2 rockets and after No. 3 Commando had captured it with the support of a number of tanks, a search found a number of these weapons, along with about 100 scientists who had been working in the factory.|$|E
5000|$|In 2006, Hoffs {{teamed up}} with fellow Ming Tea rocker Matthew Sweet; <b>under</b> <b>the</b> name [...] "Sid n Susie," [...] they {{recorded}} fifteen cover versions of classic rock songs from the 1960s and 1970s for an album titled <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Covers,</b> Vol. 1. <b>The</b> album was released in April 2006.

5|$|An attack {{had been}} planned for 18 September but was {{postponed}} due to the poor weather. On 25 September, the attack went ahead. It was intended to extend the front to high ground that was known as Factory Corner. The high ground was undefended, and the 1st Brigade easily captured it <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> of a creeping barrage. Two days later, Factory Corner formed the launchpad for a further attack by the brigade and the neighbouring 55th Division on two more trenchlines, designated Gird Trench and Gird Support. This time, the attack was not as straightforward and it took an extra day before the entire objective was in New Zealand hands. On 1 October, as a preliminary to the Battle of Le Transloy, 2nd Brigade's Otago and Canterbury battalions captured strongpoints near Eaucourt L'Abbaye, which fell to the 47th Division two days later.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{the third}} phase of the Passchendaele offensive, the 10th Australian Brigade—of which McGee's 40th Battalion was part—was {{detailed}} to execute an attack on Broodseinde Ridge. The brigade was allocated four primary objectives to seize during the assault, one for each battalion, with the 40th Battalion to take the final target located on the ridge itself. The advance commenced at the predetermined time of 06:00 on 4 October 1917, <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> of an artillery barrage. The first three battalions were able to seize their objectives, though the fighting intensified with each stage. As the 40th Battalion set to advance towards the final objective, its progress became hampered by increasingly heavy machine-gun and rifle fire, {{as well as by}} barbed wire entanglements and sectors of impassable swamp.|$|E
5|$|Burgoyne lost 1,000 {{men in the}} two battles, {{leaving him}} outnumbered by roughly 3 to 1; American losses came to about 500 killed and wounded. Burgoyne had also lost several of his most {{effective}} leaders, his attempts to capture the American position had failed, and his forward line was now breached. That night he lit fires at his remaining forward positions and withdrew <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> of darkness. On the morning of October 8, {{he was back in}} the fortified positions he had held on September 16. By October 13 he was surrounded at Saratoga, and on October 17 he surrendered his army. The remnants of his expedition retreated from Ticonderoga back to Quebec.|$|E
