50|$|Flame <b>contact</b> <b>welding</b> is a {{very common}} form of welding. The most popular kind of flame <b>contact</b> <b>welding</b> is oxyfuel gas <b>welding.</b> Flame <b>contact</b> <b>welding</b> uses a flame exposed {{to the surface of}} the metals being welded to melt and then join them together. Oxyfuel uses oxygen as a primary {{ignition}} source in tandem with another gas such as acetylene to produce a flame which is 2500oC at the tip and 2800-3500oC at the tip of the inner cone. Other gasses such as propane and methanol can be used for oxyfuel welding. Acetylene is the most common gas used in oxyfuel welding.|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{commercial}} silver metal <b>contacts</b> <b>welded</b> on top {{of brass}} or silver plated copper substrates {{have been exposed to}} air rich in SO 2 and air rich in NaCl. Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive Analysis of the exposed contact surfaces were performed to identify the corrosion byproducts {{on top of}} the silver <b>contacts,</b> substrates, and <b>welding</b> materials. Surface corrosion products were mainly found to consist of small spherules of Cu-Zn or Ag-Cu compounds which cover the surface of the contact proper with low adhesion properties.

Electrical characterization of the contacting materials was based upon dc temperature overheat tests, current switching cycle tests, and energy storage during ac current excitation.
