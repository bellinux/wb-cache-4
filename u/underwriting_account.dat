50|$|The firm {{acquired}} Front Royal, Inc. (along {{with its}} subsidiaries Colony and Rockwood), an {{insurance holding company}} headquartered in Morrisville, N.C. for $165 million in cash. The acquisition added products and underwriting capabilities in areas complementary to Argonaut’s previous products. Then they entered the public entity market by founding Trident Insurance. In 2002, they acquired Fulcrum, an excess and surplus lines underwriter from Scor. In 2003 they acquired Grocers from Royal & Sun Alliance USA, expanding their Great Central platform. In 2005 they acquired the renewal rights to business formerly written by Interstate Insurance Group, subsidiaries of Fireman’s Fund. In May 2005 they created Argonaut Specialty to <b>underwrite</b> <b>accounts</b> larger than what Colony traditionally wrote.

50|$|Physicians {{and other}} health care {{providers}} lack the necessary actuarial, <b>underwriting,</b> <b>accounting</b> and finance skills for insurance risk management, but their most severe problem is the greater variation in their estimates of the average patient cost, which leaves them at a financial disadvantage as compared to insurers whose estimates are far more accurate. Because their risks are a function of portfolio size, providers can reduce their risks only by increasing the numbers of patients they carry on their rosters, but their inefficiency relative to that of the insurers' is far greater than can be mitigated by these increases. To manage risk as efficiently as an insurer, a provider would have to assume 100% of the insurer's portfolio. HMOs and insurers manage their costs better than risk-assuming healthcare providers and cannot make risk-adjusted capitation payments without sacrificing profitability. Risk-transferring entities will enter into such agreements only if they can maintain the levels of profits they achieve by retaining risks.|$|R

However, existing loan underwriting practices provide no incentive for building owners to make their buildings more energy efficient. In this paper, we develop a commercial-mortgage valuation, or <b>underwriting,</b> strategy that <b>accounts</b> for the energy risk of individual office buildings, this energy risk being a function of both the relative energy efficiency of the building and the characteristics of its location. Our method extends standard <b>underwriting</b> practices, which <b>account</b> for the expected dynamics of interest rates and office building prices over time, by including the expected dynamics of the electricity and gas prices as well as quantity dynamics appropriate to the location of the building. This allows lenders to explicitly take into account the effect of energy use and various alternative efficiency measures when underwriting commercial mortgages...|$|R

40|$|Lowering of {{underwriting}} standards {{may have contributed}} much to the unprecedented recent rise and subsequent fall of mortgage volumes and house prices. Conventional data do not satisfactorily measure aggregate {{underwriting standards}} over the past decade: the easing and then tightening of underwriting, inside and especially outside of banks, was likely much more extensive than they indicate. Given mortgage market developments since the mid- 1990 s, the method of principal components produces a superior indicator of mortgage underwriting standards. We show that the resulting indicator better fits the variation over time in the laxity and tightness of underwriting. Based on a vector auto-regression, we then show how conditions affected underwriting standards. The results also show that our new indicator of <b>underwriting</b> helps <b>account</b> for the behavior of mortgage volumes, house prices, and gross domestic product during the recent boom in mortgage and housing markets. ...|$|R
40|$|This review surveys a resurgent ethnographic {{interest}} in radio media {{in order to}} identify the contours and potentials of an emergent anthropology of radio. We first locate such scholarship in relation to long-standing questions about the nature and power of technological mediation, as well as voice, sound, and aurality. This allows us to reveal how conceptualizations of a singular ontology of radio often implicitly <b>underwrite</b> most <b>accounts</b> of its social power. Finally, we draw attention to how recent but rarely consolidated anthropological efforts to engage ethnographically with radio technology and its sensorial affordances require critically rethinking the relationships among radio, ontology, and mediation. In doing so, this review advances a new working definition of radio: not as an old medium on the verge of obsolescence, but as a vibrant domain for acoustically resignifying the ontological that merits sustained ethnographic exploration. 16 page(s...|$|R

40|$|After {{a number}} of warning signs, the U. S. "subprime {{mortgage}} crisis" became a headline issue in February 2007. Notwithstanding the bankruptcy of numerous mortgage companies, historically high delinquencies and foreclosures, and a significant tightening in subprime lending standards, the impact thus far on core U. S. financial institutions has been limited. This paper reviews the history {{and structure of the}} subprime market. The results suggest that new origination and funding technology appear to have made the financial system more stable at the expense of undermining the effectiveness of consumer protection regulation.

40|$|Engineering {{insurance}} covers {{damage to}} plant, machinery and other engineering {{equipment such as}} boilers, computers, cranes and lifts. The underwriting process of engineering insurance is therefore complex as different types of risks from a big variety of industries are involved. The underwriting process of engineering insurance often requires specialists such as engineers to identify and analyse the particular risks. The objective of this research paper focuses on the improvement of financial decision-making regarding the underwriting process of engineering insurance. Secondary as well as primary data were necessary to reach this objective. The secondary data addressed the underwriting process of engineering insurance {{as well as the}} underwriting factors which should be considered by the short-term insurers when they are underwriting engineering insurance. The empirical study embodied an opinion survey which included the top 10 South African short-term insurers which underwrite engineering insurance. As they are the market leaders in this country concerning engineering insurance, due attention was paid to obtain their perceptions regarding the importance of the underwriting factors of engineering insurance, the problem areas which the respondents encounter during the underwriting process, as well as how often the respondents need to adjust the policy stipulations to take the <b>underwriting</b> factors into <b>account.</b> As South Africa is a developing country and has an emerging market economy, the conclusions of this study should also be valuable to other countries which are classified similarl...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} systematic study of Aristotle 2 ̆ 7 s theory of elemental bodies. In {{the first part}} of the study, I analyze Aristotle 2 ̆ 7 s characterizations of the elements. I contrast Aristotle 2 ̆ 7 s view with those of the Atomists and Plato, who take the simple bodies to be either identical with certain geometric structures (Plato 2 ̆ 7 s Timaeus) or essentially and most distinctively characterized by them (the Atomists). Aristotle, I argue, thinks that both views preclude a satisfactory account of the unity of complex bodies and, as a result, rehabilitates a more traditional view of the elements according to which they are characterized in terms of a limited set of powers (dunameis). ^ Aristotle offers two such characterizations of the elements, however. The first is tailored to his cosmology and highlights the locomotive powers (the light and the heavy) that establish the general architecture of the cosmos. The second is tailored to his chemistry and highlights the basic sensible powers (the hot, the cold, the moist, and the dry) that <b>underwrite</b> his <b>accounts</b> of elemental transformation and mixture. The latter, chemical characterization, I argue, is explanatory of the cosmological characterization. ^ That result pays dividends in my interpretation of the elements 2 ̆ 7 hylomorphic structure. Although the elements are the simplest bodies, I argue that Aristotle is committed to sub-elemental (prime) matter. An element 2 ̆ 7 s form is a pair of basic sensible powers. Its matter, qua matter, is potentially hot or cold and potentially moist or dry, but insofar as it is inseparable from the elements, it is always actually characterized by one power from each contrary pair. ^ In the second part of the study, I turn from Aristotle 2 ̆ 7 s characterizations of the elements to his conception of what it is to be an element. An elemental body, I argue, is indivisible into bodies different in form and a primary component in the composition of other bodies. I offer novel interpretations of each criterion. The result is a clearer picture both of Aristotle 2 ̆ 7 s chemical theory of matter and its relationship to central concerns in his metaphysics. ...|$|R
40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} making of the modern division between the political and the economic realm. To modern political reason, the economy appears like a self-standing reality, internally related in terms of functions and understood to follow regulating laws of its own. The dissertation counters this account of the relation between the economic and the political realm. It analyzes the epistemological claims to objectivity, on which this division rests and shows how the allegedly neutral depictions of economic necessity remain inextricably linked to political imaginations of order. The main thesis of the work posits that the modern rendering of economic reality in terms of a self-contained and functional realm stems from the desire to establish secure foundations for a viable body politic. The works of Malthus and Keynes are the exemplary cases for this study of the intimate relations between political reason and accounts of economic objectivity. The writings of Malthus crystallize in important respects the emergence of the specific modern objectivity {{at the beginning of the}} nineteenth century. With him, the notion of scarcity gained its important role for defining economy. It is shown that the definition of economy in terms of scarcity is tied to Malthus? attempts to envision a regulatory epistemology for the social body, which ensures a silent and visceral order against the uncertainties of the political world. The economic realm is thus conceived as the foundation of the body politic. The writings of Keynes witness the crisis of this economic foundation at the beginning of the twentieth century. The dissertation explicates Keynes? critique of the epistemology of scarcity, which <b>underwrites</b> modern <b>accounts</b> of economy. He opens a perspective on economy in terms of temporality, conventions and power, which traverses the closed boundaries of the economy. But this different view on economy is overlaid by Keynes? political desires to procure new foundations for the body politic: the envisioning of a national economy under the guidance of the economic expert, for which Keynesian economics is known, fulfills this desire. The thinking of economy is thus shown to be inextricably tied to the question of the political...|$|R
40|$|This article {{contends that}} film studies has {{consistently}} denigrated "pretty" images: those that emphasize detailed composition, excess color, or decorative style. While the term deliberately invokes the triviality of "pretty pictures," the article questions this taken-for-granted rhetoric of value, proposing that the "pretty" as a recurrent taste category in film reveals an imbrication of gender, sexuality, and {{race in the}} construction of the cinematic image itself. Analysis of the pretty's antecedents in histories of art demonstrates how colonial and patriarchal modes of aesthetic judgment enter into film theory. Within the pretty, then, we might find unexpected potential to think aesthetics otherwise. Pretty is an invented term; that which it names is figured differently and often implicitly across film theories that have few similarities except for this strange commonality in what they reject. After outlining the conceptual potential of the pretty, this article traces a thread among diverse theoretical models, defining the category through its absences and exclusions. Thus Andr Bazin advocates for the contingent and the unposed, while post- 1968 Marxism valorizes the antiaesthetic qualities of countercinema. These practices draw on disparate value systems, but both reject decorative composition. Likewise, while feminist and queer theories have often valued spectacle and surface, a structuring iconophobia can still <b>underwrite</b> even radical <b>accounts</b> of representation. By tracing and interrogating the theoretical history of the pretty and its exclusion, this article seeks to trouble the discursive field of aesthetics and politics in film theory...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{makes the}} case that with resources from Gregory of Nazianzus’ theology of Scripture and biblical exegesis, the promise of Hans Frei’s approach to the Christian reading of the Bible as Scripture may be furthered, especially {{in regard to the}} spiritual function of Scripture, and its appropriation and application to the reader, and the theology that <b>underwrites</b> such an <b>account.</b> It does so by bringing Nazianzen and Frei into dialogue. Chapter 1 sets forth the coherence of Nazianzen’s theology of Scripture, showing his account of its sanctifying function as a vessel of divine accommodation, instruction and pedagogy. It also analyses the hermeneutical comments scattered in his writings and draws from there the account of the historical shape of salvation as related in Scripture, and the ineluctability of the surface of Scripture as the starting point for exegesis, and shows how characterisations of Gregory advocating allegory are mistaken. Chapter 2 shows the coherence and robustness of Hans Frei’s response to the challenge of history, how it leads to questions of spiritual appropriation, and its relative thinness in comparison with Gregory’s account. Chapter 3 demonstrates the promise of Frei’s account of the spiritual function of Scripture, its appropriation and application, but also argues that it remains over-general, and fails to reconcile the transcendence of Christ in his divinity with his intimacy with the believing reader; problems to which Gregory’s theology seems to suggest answers. Chapter 4 sketches such answers by examining Gregory’s uses of Scripture in light of his theology of Scripture and hermeneutics, Gregory’s reading of Christ as the New Adam, his account of salvation as participation in Christ and of the appropriation of the meaning of Christ’s story as partaking in the pattern of his narrated identity through baptism and ascesis, and three practices of such appropriation.
