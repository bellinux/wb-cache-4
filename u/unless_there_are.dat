If more than twoundefeated teams remain, then one or more of those teams must be left out. If one or fewer undefeated teams remain, then an opponent must be chosen from among the one-loss teams, meaning that other one-loss teams will be left out.|$|E

5|$|Cordyline australis is a light-demanding pioneer species, and {{seedlings}} die when overtopped {{by other}} trees. To grow well, young plants require open space {{so they are}} not shaded out by other vegetation. Another requirement is water during the seedling stage. Although adult trees can store water and are drought resistant, seedlings need a good supply of water to survive. This stops the species from growing in sand dunes <b>unless</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> wet depressions present, and from hillsides {{unless there is a}} seepage area. The fertility of the soil is another factor—settlers in Canterbury used the presence of the species to situate their homesteads and gardens. The fallen leaves of the tree also help to raise the fertility of the soil when they break down. Another factor is temperature, especially the degree of frost. Young trees are killed by frost, and even old trees can be cut back. This is why C.australis is absent from upland areas and from very frosty inland areas.|$|E
5|$|From a user's perspective, an HDMI display can {{be driven}} by a single-link DVI-D source, since HDMI and DVI-D define an {{overlapping}} minimum set of allowed resolutions and framebuffer formats to ensure a basic level of interoperability. In the reverse case a DVI-D monitor {{would have the same}} level of basic interoperability <b>unless</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> content protection issues with High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) or the HDMI color encoding is in component color space YCbCr which is not possible in DVI, instead of RGB. An HDMI source such as a Blu-ray player may demand HDCP-compliance of the display, and refuse to output HDCP-protected content to a non-compliant display. A further complication {{is that there is a}} small amount of display equipment, such as some high-end home theater projectors, designed with HDMI inputs but not HDCP-compliant.|$|E
5|$|The {{main goal}} of {{treatment}} {{is to treat}} shock and preserve kidney function. Initially this is done through the administration of generous amounts of intravenous fluids, usually isotonic saline (0.9% weight per volume sodium chloride solution). In victims of crush syndrome, it is recommended to administer intravenous fluids even before they are extracted from collapsed structures. This will ensure sufficient circulating volume {{to deal with the}} muscle cell swelling (which typically commences when blood supply is restored), and to prevent the deposition of myoglobin in the kidneys. Amounts of 6 to 12liters over 24hours are recommended. The rate of fluid administration may be altered to achieve a high urine output (200–300ml/h in adults), <b>unless</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> other reasons why this might lead to complications, such as a history of heart failure.|$|E

They have therefore sought to identify the kind of tax system that would minimize this distortion.|$|E

25|$|Other {{processes}} in which synthetic rubies {{can be produced}} are through Czochralski's pulling process, flux process, and the hydrothermal process. Most synthetic rubies originate from flame fusion, due to the low costs involved. Synthetic rubies may have no imperfections {{visible to the naked}} eye but magnification may reveal curves, striae and gas bubbles. The fewer the number and the less obvious the imperfections, the more valuable the ruby is; <b>unless</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no imperfections (i.e., a perfect ruby), in which case it will be suspected of being artificial. Dopants are added to some manufactured rubies so they can be identified as synthetic, but most need gemological testing to determine their origin.|$|E

25|$|To prevent {{dehydration}} {{readily available}} fluids, preferably {{with a modest}} amount of sugars and salt such as vegetable broth or salted rice water, may be used. The drinking of additional clean water is also recommended. Once dehydration develops oral rehydration solutions are preferred. As much of these drinks as the person wants can be given, <b>unless</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> signs of swelling. If vomiting occurs, fluids can be paused for 5–10 minutes and then restarting more slowly. Vomiting rarely prevents rehydration as fluid are still absorbed and the vomiting rarely last long. A severely malnourished child with {{what appears to be}} dehydration but who has not had diarrhea should be treated as if they have an infection.|$|E

If standard treatments exist for the disease being studied in clinical trials, a standard treatment is always used in place of a placebo for serious diseases. In research experimental studies, the method of establishing a proper control group to eliminate the placebo effect has also been difficult, particularly for surgical and therapy interventions that are not pharmaceutical in nature. Notably, there has been much debate of whether to use a placebo pill or conduct a sham procedure as a control.|$|E
