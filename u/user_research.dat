40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{specific}} segment of libraries’ activities which has been much exposed recently – the user. For the library of today, opinions of its users {{are no longer a}} curiosity; they are an important aspect of its research activities and also of its administrative practices. The {{purpose of this paper is}} thus twofold: to outline a broader framework of library <b>users</b> <b>research</b> and to discuss selected dilemmas that commonly arise in this framework. As <b>users</b> <b>research</b> has become a prominent activity in the international arena and has also established itself in Slovenia, the paper comments on most popular measurement instruments for library <b>users</b> <b>research</b> (SERVQUAL, LibQUAL+) and also on the ways of defining key dimensions of users’ perceptions of the library service. Special attention is placed on a systematic distinction between the concept of library service quality and users’ satisfaction. This is an important conceptual dilemma which also affects research methodology. The concluding part of the paper presents and empirical analysis of the relation between the selected dimensions of users’ satisfaction and their success in searching for desired library materials. This problem is conceptually extracted from contemporary debates about the results of users’ research, whereas in practical terms it derives from the context of one of the public libraries in Ljubljana...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} characteristics that can be used to assess early-stage research results by <b>research</b> <b>users</b> and <b>research</b> producers of the advanced biofuel sector. Mainly, it qualitatively explores the perceptions of both <b>research</b> <b>users</b> and <b>research</b> producers regarding their experiences with research results. The study builds on the models of Diffusion of Innovation (DoI), Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Perceived Characteristics of Innovation (PCI). The findings of this study suggest that the investigated dimensions of DoI, PCI and TAM are applicable to the context of assessing research results with the extra dimension of risk reduction. In particular, some of the criteria used to assess the usefulness of research results are through its originality, scalability and relevance. The findings also suggest that documentation and publication are important to <b>research</b> users: <b>Research</b> <b>users</b> assess ease of use based on the presentation of the research results in their documentation; and they assess the quality of research results based on publications and the reputation of researchers. The findings of this study can be used to tailor research results to research users’ needs, which in turn can be expected to improve the uptake and further development of research results. This will not only permit the push of scientific research results to <b>research</b> <b>users</b> only put also permit <b>research</b> <b>users</b> to inform <b>research</b> needs...|$|R

For this task, there is a large volume of irrelevant documents and the proportion of relevant documents is very small. It is also critical that the agent not misclassify relevant documents. Information Retrieval and Neural Network techniques were utilized to learn the model of user's preferences. Learning was boot-strapped using papers and proposals the user had written as positive examples. The agent's performance at startup is quite high.
