50|$|This {{species can}} be {{confused}} with the <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis</b> when seen at a distance but the <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis</b> is smaller, more gregarious, associated with wetlands and lacks the white on the wing and has a fully feathered head.|$|R
40|$|Artiﬁcial {{wetlands}} provide alternative habitats for waterbirds. The Doñana rice ﬁelds (SW Spain) are extensively {{used as a}} foraging site by the <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis</b> (Plegadis falcinellus). The aim of {{this study}} was to develop an individual-based model to predict the possible effects of glossy ibis’ population growth, reductions in the rice cultivated area, and changes on the phenology of the management processes of the paddies on the mortality rate of the <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis</b> population. We test the hypothesis that the <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis</b> breeding population of Doñana can obtain its energy requirements during the non-breeding season by feeding on rice ﬁelds alone. Our results show that the <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis</b> population growth is not currently lim- ited by rice ﬁeld availability. However, a reduction of 80...|$|R
50|$|The {{white-faced ibis}} bears a strong {{resemblance}} to the related <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis</b> {{and in the past}} was sometimes considered to be a subspecies of the <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis.</b> Another theory was that upon coming to the New World, a small isolated <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis</b> population evolved to become its own separate species. However, recent molecular phylogenetic studies show that the white-faced ibis may actually be paraphyletic. In fact, members of the white-faced ibis populations in the United States appear to be more closely related to glossy ibises than to members of white-faced ibis populations in Southern Brazil.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} {{bald ibis}} is readily distinguished from its close relative, the southern bald ibis of Southern Africa, by the southern species' whitish face. The northern bald can also {{be confused with the}} similarly dark-plumaged <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis,</b> which overlaps its range, but it is larger and stockier than that species. In flight, when the bill and face colouration may not be visible, the bald ibis' less rounded wings and shorter neck give it a different profile from <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis,</b> and its relatively short legs mean that its feet do not project beyond the tail, unlike those of the <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis.</b>|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY. —Sex {{determination}} in <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis</b> chicks {{based on}} morphological characters. Aims: We derived two discriminant equations to sex <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis</b> Plegadis falcinellus chicks (2 - 5 we-eks old) based on morphological characters. Location: Doñana, South-West Spain. Methods: Wing length and tarsus length and width of 198 individuals were {{measured in the}} 2002 and 2003 breeding seasons. Results: Tarsus width was the most discriminant character and in combination with wing length allo-wed us to sex 86. 9 % of individuals correctly. A formula based on wing and tarsus length also sexed 84. 9 % of individuals correctly. The reliability of this second equation was also tested with an independent sam-ple of 209 individuals measured in 2004, with error rates {{similar to those of}} the original data. Intervals for discriminant scores reducing errors in sexing to 10 % or 5 % were derived, at the cost of reducing the proportion of individuals that can be sexed. These equations should not be applied in other localities wi-thout validation, but our analyses suggest they can be used on different cohorts. We also describe a vi-sual sexing technique found to have 95 % accuracy for an experienced observer. Conclusions: Sex can be reliably determined for many <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis</b> chicks.
