2500|$|HMNZS Canterbury (F421) {{was one of}} {{two broad}} beam Leander-class frigates {{operated}} by the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) from 1971 to 2005. [...] She was built in Scotland and launched in 1970. Commissioned in 1971, Canterbury saw operational service in much of Australasia and other regions like the Persian Gulf. She undertook operations such as supporting UN sanctions against Iraq and peace-keeping in East Timor. With her sister ship HMNZS Waikato she relieved the Royal Navy frigate [...] in the Indian Ocean during the Falklands War. Early in HMNZS Canterbury's career she relieved the frigate [...] at Moruroa during anti-nuclear protests, in 1973, F 421 being the most effectively insulated frigate, from nuclear fallout, with the Improved Broad Beam Leander steam plant, for e.g., being remote controlled and capable of <b>unmanned</b> <b>operation</b> and therefore the ship [...] a more effective sealed citadel for operations in areas of nuclear explosions.|$|E

50|$|Any reuse of the {{existing}} machinery would likely involve the installation of automatic shutdown capability to avoid the need for 24-hour manning of the power station {{in order to improve}} the economics of refurbishment.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} two simple simulation and modelling tools {{designed to}} aid in the safety assessment required for <b>unmanned</b> aircraft <b>operations</b> within unsegregated airspace. First, a fast pair-wise encounter generator is derived to simulate the See and Avoid environment. The utility of the encounter generator is demonstrated through the development of a hybrid database and a statistical performance evaluation of an autonomous See and Avoid decision and control strategy. Second, an unmanned aircraft mission generator is derived to help visualise the impact of multiple persistent <b>unmanned</b> <b>operations</b> on existing air traffic. The utility of the mission generator is demonstrated through an example analysis of a mixed airspace environment using real traffic data in Australia. These simulation and modelling approaches constitute a useful and extensible set of analysis tools, that can be leveraged to help explore some of the more fundamental and challenging problems facing civilian unmanned aircraft system integration...|$|R

She served, among other stations, the South Goodwin in 1961, the Tongue in 1973, the Falls from 1973 to 1976 and the Varne in 1977. Her last station was the South Goodwin again, before being withdrawn from service for conversion to <b>unmanned</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Contracts average at the 4 month {{mark for}} officers, with generous leave. Most ocean-going vessels now operate an {{unmanned}} engine room system allowing engineers to work days only. The engine room is computer controlled by night, although the duty engineer will make inspections during <b>unmanned</b> <b>operation.</b> Engineers {{work in a}} hot, humid, noisy atmosphere. Communication in the engine room is therefore by hand signals and lip-reading, and good teamwork often stands in place of any communication at all.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain higher {{productivity}} under <b>unmanned</b> <b>operations</b> in end milling, a reliable technique for process monitoring and control is required. This paper presents a monitoring method of cutting forces by using high-accuracy displacement sensors installed in a spindle of a machining center. Its estimation performance is experimentally investigated by machining tests on carbon steel under different cutting conditions. It is found that the estimation error is caused mainly by the drift in the displacement sensor output. With its compensation scheme implemented, the experimental result shows that the monitoring of small and medium scale cutting forces is possible, if cutting process is intermittent. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{monitoring}} and control of urban critical infrastructures consists of the protection of assets such as houses, offices, government and private buildings, with low cost, high quality and high dependability. In order to satisfy all these requirements at the same time, the control {{of a number of}} assets has to be performed by means of automated systems based on networks of heterogeneous sensors. This new concept idea is based on the use of <b>unmanned</b> <b>operations</b> at each of the many remote assets (each asset is monitored through a network of sensors) and a man-in-the-loop automated control in a central site (Operational Center), which performs alarm detection and system management...|$|R
5000|$|In the U.S., {{thousands}} of civilian UAV operators work for contractors, piloting and maintaining UAVs. [...] Up to four UAVs and about 400 to 500 pilot and ground support personnel {{are required for}} a single 24-hour-coverage combat air patrol (CAP). A 2011 study by the Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine indicated that nearly 50% of spy UAV operators suffer from high stress. [...] The president of a civilian UAV operators' union, the Association of <b>Unmanned</b> <b>Operation</b> (AUO), cited long working hours and decreasing wages as U.S. involvement in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan was reduced {{and as a result}} of the U.S. government's budget sequestration.|$|E

In El Paso, Texas there is a similar project in operation that produces 19 m3/day. In Kuwait a MSF facility has been built using parabolic trough collectors to provide the necessary solar thermal energy to produce 100 m3 of fresh water a day.

40|$|There is {{presently}} a trend to "internalize" external transport links {{within the framework}} of large production system networks. This is made possible by the rapidly increasing capability to swiftly exchange huge masses of data within such networks and the availability of a deregulated transport sector, where the highly competitive trucking industry sets the rules. The result is new forms of logistics systems, designed to meet a set of service requirements which go beyond low cost. The impact of such systems on the evolution of material handling technologies is discussed. Details of one operational Just in Time system and one hypothetical JIT transport system connecting two production plants with particularly <b>unmanned</b> <b>operations</b> are included for the purpose of illustration...|$|R

Although {{they are capable of}} <b>unmanned</b> <b>operations,</b> as in Vancouver and Detroit, the TTC opted to use one-man operation on all trains, a practice which was later used on heavy-rail Toronto Rocket sets on Line 4 beginning in 2016. Trains on Line 1, Line 2, on the other hand, carry two personnel on board (an operator and a guard) while in service.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Mobile {{road works}} on the hard {{shoulder}} of German highways bear an increased accident risk for {{the crew of the}} protective vehicle which safeguards road works against moving traffic. The project “Automated Unmanned Protective Vehicle for Highway Hard Shoulder Road Works ” aims at the <b>unmanned</b> <b>operation</b> of the protective vehicle in order to reduce this risk. Simultaneously, this means the very first <b>unmanned</b> <b>operation</b> of a vehicle on German roads in public traffic. This contribution introduces the project by pointing out the main objectives and demonstrates {{the current state of the}} system design regarding functionality, modes of operation, as well as the functional system architecture. Pivotal for the project, the scientific challenges raised by the <b>unmanned</b> <b>operation</b> – strongly related to the general challenges in the field of automated driving – are presented as well. The results of the project shall serve as a basis to stimulate an advanced discussion about ensuring safety for fully automated vehicles in public traffic operating at higher speeds and in less defined environments. Thus, this contribution aims at contacting the scientific community in an early state of the project. I...|$|E

40|$|Many mission {{operations}} {{systems and}} tools {{have been developed}} over the past decades as NASA has operated the Mars Exploration Rovers, the Space Shuttle, and International Space Station. Usually there is little crossfertilization between the <b>unmanned</b> mission <b>operations</b> systems and those used for manned spaceflight. NASA Ames Research Center has been developing and applying its advanced intelligent systems research to mission operations tools for both <b>unmanned</b> mars missions <b>operations</b> with the NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory since 2001 and to manned operations with NASA Johnson Space Center since 2006.
