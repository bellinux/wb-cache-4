40|$|<b>Duck</b> <b>Hawk</b> Bluffs, {{southwest}} Banks Island, is {{a primary}} section (8 km long and 60 m high) in the western Canadian Arctic Archipelago exposing a long record of Quaternary sedimentation adjacent to the Arctic Ocean. A reinvestigation of <b>Duck</b> <b>Hawk</b> Bluffs demonstrates {{that it is a}} previously unrecognized thrust-block moraine emplaced from the northeast by Laurentide ice. Previous stratigraphic models of <b>Duck</b> <b>Hawk</b> Bluffs reported a basal unit of preglacial fluvial sand and gravel (Beaufort Fm, forested Arctic), overlain by a succession of three glaciations and at least two interglacials. Our observations dismiss the occurrence of preglacial sediments and amalgamate the entire record into three glacial intervals and one prominent interglacial. The first glacigenic sedimentation is recorded by an ice-contact sandur containing redeposited allochthonous organics previously assigned to the Beaufort Fm. This is overlain by fine-grained sediments with ice wedge pseudomorphs and well-preserved bryophyte assemblages corresponding to an interglacial environment similar to modern. The second glacial interval is recorded by ice-proximal mass flows and marine rhythmites that were glacitectonized when Laurentide ice overrode the site from Amundsen Gulf to the south. Sediments of this interval have been reported to be magnetically reversed (> 780 ka). The third interval of glacigenic sedimentation includes glacifluvial sand and gravel recording the arrival of Laurentide ice that overrode the site from the northeast (island interior) depositing a glacitectonite and constructing the thrust block moraine that comprises <b>Duck</b> <b>Hawk</b> Bluffs. Sediments of this interval have been reported to be magnetically normal (< 780 ka). The glacitectonite contains a highly deformed melange of pre-existing sediments that were previously assigned to several formally named, marine and interglacial deposits resting in an undeformed sequence. In contrast, the tectonism associated with the thrust block moraine imparted pervasive deformation throughout all underlying units, highlighted by a previously unrecognized raft of Cretaceous bedrock. During this advance, Laurentide ice from the interior of Banks Island coalesced with an ice stream in Amundsen Gulf, depositing the interlobate Sachs Moraine that contains shells as young as ∼ 24 cal ka BP (Late Wisconsinan). During deglaciation, meltwater emanating from these separating ice lobes deposited outwash that extended to deglacial marine limit (11 m asl) along the west coast of Banks Island. Our new stratigraphic synthesis fundamentally revises and simplifies the record of past Quaternary environments preserved on southwest Banks Island, which serves as a key terrestrial archive for palaeoenvironmental change...|$|R

50|$|A hiker who ascends beyond Arch Rock will {{gradually}} hear {{the shift from}} the powerful company of Alum Cave Creek to the smaller Styx Branch, which accompanies the path for a short distance. Inspiration Point is the next landmark along this less trafficked, though still popular, portion of the trail. Upon this outcropping of rocks about 4700 ft in elevation, a hiker can, on a clear day, get an unobscured view of the surrounding landscape, most notably Little <b>Duck</b> <b>Hawk</b> Ridge. Not far from Inspiration Point, the Eye of the Needle (a round, see-through hole cut {{into the side of}} Little <b>Duck</b> <b>Hawk</b> Ridge) can be seen to the left as the hiker continues along the now rocky trail. Not far from there, at 2.2 mi from the trail head, the hiker finds the ubiquitous orange clay of Alum Cave Bluff. The bluff is at 4950 ft in elevation, and is 80 ft in height. The bluff is the final destination along the trail for many hikers. In winter, massive icicles often form and crash down onto the trail, making the bluff dangerous; in other seasons, the bluff forms a shelter from the frequent rainstorms in these mountains.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The Beaufort Formation, in its type area on Prince Patrick Island, is {{a single}} lithostratigraphic unit, a few tens of metres thick, {{consisting}} of unlithified sandy deposits of braided rivers. Organic beds in the sand have yielded more than 200 species of plants and insects and probably originated during the Pliocene, when the area supported coniferous forest. This Beaufort unit forms the thin eastern edge of a northwest-thickening wedge of sand and gravel beneath {{the western part of}} the island. These largely unexposed beds, up to several hundred metres thick, include the Beaufort unit and perhaps other older or younger deposits. On the islands northeast and southwest of Prince Patrick Island (Meighen Island to Banks Island), the name Beaufort Formation has been applied to similar deposits of late Rrtiary age. Most recorded Beaufort beds on these islands are stratigraphically and paleontologically equivalent to the “type ” Beaufort, but a few sites that have been called Beaufort (such as <b>Duck</b> <b>Hawk</b> Bluffs and the lower unit at Ballast Brook, on Banks Island) differ stratigraphically and paleontologically from the “type ” Beaufort. This paper recommends that these deposits (probably middle Miocene) and others like them be assigned new stratigraphic names and not be included in the Beaufort Formation as now defined. Informal names Mary Sachs gravel (<b>Duck</b> <b>Hawk</b> Bluffs) and Ballast Brook beds are proposed as an initial step. Formal use of the name Beaufort Formation should be restricted to the western Arctic Islands.

50|$|Since 2004, Friends of Five Creeks {{volunteers have}} focused on the reach from Adams Street {{downstream}} to Pierce Street. The largest task continues to be removing evergreen thornless blackberry, which quickly clogs the creek and increases flooding. With help from both cities, volunteers also have removed other invasives, planted natives, and installed amenities such as benches, signs, and a table in the Creekside Parks facing each other in Albany and El Cerrito. Parkland extends to most of Albany Hill, with grasslands, a willow grove at the mouth of Middle Creek, and mature oak forest on the steep north face of the hill. Thus this complex is an unusual island of urban green space and habitat surrounded by city.
