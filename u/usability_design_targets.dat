The guide can be used for path-finding or simple information retrieving but also as a learning tool for school children, students and cultural heritage tourists.

Today, the web design is moving from technology to users i. e. it is more user-centered than ever before. “Web design must directly face users with the specific needs, and must ensure that users are pleasant to successfully complete tasks with it. ” [1].

40|$|Abstract: Adaptive {{applications}} {{constitute the}} basis for many ubiquitous computing scenarios as they can dynamically adapt to changing contexts. The <b>usability</b> <b>design</b> principles transparency, controllability, and consistency have been recommended {{for the design of}} adaptive interfaces. However, designing self-adaptive applications that may act completely autonomous is still a challenging task because there is no set of <b>usability</b> <b>design</b> guidelines. Applying the three principles {{in the design of the}} five different adaptations of the mobile adaptive application Meet-U revealed as difficult. Based on an analysis of the design problem space, we elaborate an approach for the design of usable adaptations. Our approach is based on a notification design concept which calculates the attention costs and utility benefits of notified adaptations by varying the design aspects transparency and controllability. We present several designs for the adaptations of Meet‑U. The results of a user study shows that the notification design approach is beneficial for the design of adaptations. Varying transparency and controllability is necessary to adjust an adaptation’s design to the particular context of use. This leads to a partially inconsistent design for adaptations within an application...|$|R
