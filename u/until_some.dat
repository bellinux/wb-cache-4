5|$|Due to the {{topography}} {{of the area}} in the vicinity of Scotch Run, the area near the stream was not settled <b>until</b> <b>some</b> time after the first settlement in the surrounding areas. Alexander McCauley settled on the stream in Beaver Township 1774. Some time before 1820, a carding mill was built by George Fleming on the stream southeast of Mainville.

5|$|Following {{the death}} of Kempelen, the Turk {{remained}} unexhibited <b>until</b> <b>some</b> time before 1804 when Kempelen's son decided {{to sell it to}} Johann Nepomuk Mälzel, a Bavarian musician with an interest in various machines and devices. Mälzel, whose successes included patenting a form of metronome, had tried to purchase the Turk once before, before Kempelen's death. The original attempt had failed, owing to Kempelen's asking price of 20,000 francs; Kempelen's son sold the machine to Mälzel for half this sum.|$|E

5|$|Handshake packets {{consist of}} only a single PID byte, and are {{generally}} sent in response to data packets. Error detection is provided by transmitting four bits, which represent the packet type twice, in a single PID byte using complemented form.

5|$|Sweden’s monarchy {{goes back}} as far as the Danish one, to the semi–legendary kings before the 10th century, since then it has not been interrupted.

The current royal family, the House of Bernadotte, has reigned since 1818. The current monarch is Carl XVI Gustaf.|$|E
5|$|The Life of a Great Sinner (Житие великого грешника) (December 1869 – January 1870): an {{unfinished}} novel and poem.

Similar parts of The Life of a Great Sinner were also indicated in The Possessed and The Brothers Karamazov.|$|E

Venera landers in 1975 and 1982 returned images of a surface covered in sediment and relatively angular rocks. The surface was mapped in detail by Magellan in 1990–91. The ground shows evidence of extensive volcanism, and the sulfur in the atmosphere may indicate {{that there have been}} some recent eruptions.|$|E
5|$|The new DM-15B Nike Zeus B (the earlier model retroactively {{becoming}} the A) received a go ahead for development on 16 January 1958, the same date the Air Force was officially told {{to stop all}} work on a Wizard missile. On 22 January 1958, the National Security Council gave Zeus S-Priority, the highest national priority. Additional funds were requested to the Zeus program to ensure an initial service date {{in the fourth quarter}} of 1962, but these were denied, delaying service entry <b>until</b> <b>some</b> time in 1963.|$|E

Mirabeau ran aground in February 1919 off the coast of the Crimea and could not be refloated <b>until</b> <b>some</b> of her guns and armor were removed.|$|E

5|$|Goronwy married Gwerful fil Madog, {{daughter}} of Madog ap Iorwerth, Baron Hendwr. Goronwy and Gwerful had three sons, Hywel ap Goronwy, Tudur ap Goronwy and Gruffydd ap Goronwy. Goronwy was interned {{after his death}} in the west wall of the Franciscan Llanfaes Friary near Bangor, Gwynedd on 11 December 1331. His father had overseen the reconstruction efforts of the friary, and in 1311 {{was the first of the}} family to be placed there following his death. Other members of the family were placed there following death, <b>until</b> <b>some</b> were moved following the Dissolution of the Monasteries under the Church of England imposed by King Henry VIII of England, with Goronwy's being moved to St Gredifael's Church, Penmynydd.|$|E
5|$|It has {{traditionally}} been held in Osney that the church was founded in the reign of Stephen, but this {{is unlikely to be}} true, as Thomas Becket was not martyred <b>until</b> <b>some</b> fifteen years after Stephen's death. It is known that in the 1180s, the site was granted to the canons of the nearby Osney Abbey, and a chapel was erected on the site around 1190. From the mid-13th century the Osney area was referred to as the parish of St Thomas', but it remained nominally a chapel of the abbey until the dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII, when it was placed under Christ Church, Oxford. Christ Church treated it as a conventional parish church with a curate, and from the mid-19th century the incumbent was styled a vicar.|$|E
5|$|Many of the family's {{extensive}} {{collection of}} paintings, most sourced from Spain by William, were {{donated to the}} Trust. In part {{this was due to}} their poor condition, which involved not just water but also ironically guano damage. The most important painting in the collection is the 17th-century work by Zambrano of St Lawrence, which hangs in the middle of one of the walls of the hall. It was cleaned and repaired by local art conservators Bush and Berry, who are based in a chapel William Gibbs built in the village of Flax Bourton. In 2011 the Trust bought the painting The Mater Dolorosa (Mother of Sorrows) by Bartolomé Esteban Murillo at Christie's auction in New York, which had hung at Tyntesfield since William purchased it <b>until</b> <b>some</b> time after 1910.|$|E

5|$|Over the {{following}} century the neglect continued <b>until</b> <b>some</b> basic external renovation work was undertaken between 1965 and 1971, making the structure {{wind and water}} tight, although it remained unoccupied. The castle was again abandoned and left unmaintained. The condition of the building further declined, becoming derelict. It was in a ruinous state when marketed for sale in April 2013 {{after the death of}} Count Robin Mirrlees, who had owned it for about fifty years. At the end of that year it was purchased by the former model Olga Roh, who said she intended to restore it. Modern day reports suggest that the spirit of the 3rd Lord Banff and that of a white dog haunt the castle, which is classified as a category A listed building.|$|E
5|$|The {{church in}} Northumbria {{was one of}} the major landowners, perhaps second only to the king. At the head of the Northumbrian church was the Archbishop of York, an office held by Eanbald I to 796, Eanbald II <b>until</b> <b>some</b> time after 808, and then by Wulfsige to around 830. Immediately below the {{archbishop}} were three bishops: the bishop of Lindisfarne, the bishop of Hexham and the bishop of Whithorn. The typically long term of office of senior clerics meant that kings often had to work with men appointed by their predecessors, with whom their relations might be difficult.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally {{the work}} was {{ascribed}} to either Thomas or Richard, two monks of Ely mentioned in the text. The historian Antonia Gransden is inclined {{to believe that the}} work is by Richard, who is usually identified with the Richard who was recorded as sub-prior and prior of Ely, holding the latter office from 1177 <b>until</b> <b>some</b> time between 1189 and 1194. Blake thinks that Richard was the author, but he considers the evidence to be inconclusive. Janet Fairweather, a classicist and a recent translator of the Liber, suggests that it may have been written by someone other than the traditional candidates. Whoever the author, the Liber specifically states that it was written at the bidding of some members of the monastic community at Ely.|$|E
