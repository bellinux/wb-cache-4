And, if they put aside the <b>unauthorised</b> <b>interference</b> with their business and relegate the Pentateuchal history to the region of pure fiction, they are bound to assure themselves that they do so because the plainest teachings of Nature (apart from all doubtful speculations) are irreconcilable with the assertions which they reject.|$|E

50|$|Furthermore, s 187BA {{provides}} that a service provider must protect {{the confidentiality of}} information kept by the service provider by encrypting it and protecting it from <b>unauthorised</b> <b>interference</b> or unauthorised access. The section does not prescribe {{a particular type of}} encryption. Section 187LA of the amended TIA Act supplements the obligations service providers under the Australian Privacy Principle (APP) 11.1 to 'take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to protect (personal) information from misuse, interference and loss and from unauthorised access, modification and disclosure'. These privacy safeguards are in addition to pre-existing obligations, pursuant to clause 4.6.3 of the Telecommunications Consumer Protection Code (C628:2012), which stipulate that service providers must have 'robust procedures to keep its Customers' Personal Information in its possession secure and restrict access to personnel who are authorised by the Supplier'.|$|E

40|$|The House of Lords’ {{decision}} in OBG v Allan has prompted much academic {{debate about whether}} the tort of conversion should be expanded beyond its historic sphere of application, to protect intangible assets—such as contractual rights. This article seeks to advance this debate, by examining in detail the practical implications of an extended conversion tort for the contractual rights of banks’ account-holding customers. It finds that, whilst it is technically possible to fashion an extended conversion tort to protect these rights, there is no pressing need for such protection, and the tort would be ill-equipped to offer a more coherent form of protection than is already available. These findings at least suggest reasons for caution. The {{creation of a new}} strict liability tort is a dramatic step, and would generate significant uncertainty in commercial transactions until case law has settled the scope of the tort and its practical implications in concrete settings. It seems right to demand that, before this leap is made, its practical benefits should be clearly demonstrated. I. INTRODUCTION Traditionally understood, the tort of conversion protects against <b>unauthorised</b> <b>interferences</b> with possessory rights to tangible goods. 1 In OBG v Allan, 2 the House of Lords was invited to expand the tort beyond its familiar territory. Receivers of a company in administration, acting consistently with their duties and in good faith, sold the company’s chattels and allowed contractual debts due to the company to be settled for significantly less than the actual sums owing. It was subsequently discovered that, for technical reasons, the receivers had been invalidly appointed. 3 The company, now represented by a liquidator, sued the receivers inter alia in conversion for their unauthorised dealings with its assets. Conversion clearly lay in respect of the tangible goods, but it was also argued that, to protect the company’s assets coherently, its intangible contractual rights should also be protected by the tort. Despite the obvious appeal of this argument on the facts, the House of Lords refused by a bare majority to move the tort’s established boundaries judicially. The option of reform was left to the Law Commission and Parliament...|$|R
50|$|Security and {{destruction}} of retained dataAccording to the Memorandum, the Act contains safeguards to ensure individuals' privacy rights, especially in relation to telecommunications, are protected. In particular, the Act provides that the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) in the Privacy Act 1988 apply to all data retained under the Act. Specifically, the APPs impose an obligation on service providers {{to ensure the quality}} and/or correctness of any personal information (APP 10) and to keep personal information secure (APP 11). This introduces an oversight mechanism whereby the Privacy Commissioner can review and assess service providers' collection, storage and use of data. An additional layer of privacy and security protection for consumer data provided by the Act is the requirement that service providers protect retained data through encryption and introduce the Telecommunications Sector Security Reforms, which require service providers to do their best to prevent <b>unauthorised</b> access and <b>interference.</b> These safeguards are supplemented by already-existing obligations under the Telecommunications Consumer Protection Code.|$|R
40|$|Summary Implements {{recommendations}} of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security’s (PJCIS) Report of the Inquiry into Potential Reforms of Australia’s National Security Legislation by amending the: Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 to: require telecommunications service providers to retain and to secure for two years telecommunications data (not content); require service providers to protect retained data through encryption and preventing <b>unauthorised</b> <b>interference</b> and access; require the PJCIS to review the mandatory data retention scheme {{no more than three}} {{years after the end of}} the implementation phase; limit the range of agencies that are able to access telecommunications data and stored communications; establish a journalist information warrants regime; restrict the agencies who can access this data; require the minister to refer to the PJCIS any legislative proposal to amend which agencies can access the data; provide for record-keeping and reporting the use of, and access to, telecommunications data; and enable the Commonwealth Ombudsman to assess agency compliance; Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 to provide that certain matters relating to data retention be included in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation’s (ASIO) annual report; Intelligence Services Act 2001 to enable the PJCIS to inquire into operational matters relating to the use of telecommunications data by ASIO and the Australian Federal Police, in relation to counter-terrorism functions; Telecommunications Act 1997 to prohibit civil litigants from being able to access certain telecommunications data; and Telecommunications Act 1997 and Privacy Act 1988 to make consequential amendments...|$|E
40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 2047 on 06. 20. 2017 by CS (TIS) Methods and {{equipment for the}} measurement of ocean waves were reviewed and their suitability assessed for {{the aim of this}} project: field measurement of sea waves near a reflective coastal structure such as a breakwater. None was found to be suitable. The functional and performance objectives are set out for a new system. The evolution of the final design, based on an array of pressure sensors, is described. The whole system is intended to be deployed on the sea-bed. It is fully self contained and independent of shore based services. Located away from the surf zone it is well placed to survive storm conditions and <b>unauthorised</b> <b>interference.</b> Theoretical methods for the re-construction of surface elevation records from measured sub-surface pressures, and the experimental findings of other workers, are presented. Available methods of estimating the wave directional spectrum from a spatial array of surface elevation records are reviewed, and the most appropriate one implemented. The system has given extensive service at a number of coastal defence sites. The results of subsequent analysis of selected data sets are presented in detail. They show the pronounced nodal structure in amplitude expected in the presence of wave reflection, clearly demonstrating that a single point measurement is likely to give misleading estimates of incident wave height. For near-calm to moderate, shore-normal incident wave conditions the results were found to agree with theoretical predictions both of wave height as a function of distance offshore, and of the structure's frequency-dependent reflection coefficient. For rougher conditions, in which both theoretical and physical models are less applicable, the results agreed with visual observations...|$|E
40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY As {{has been}} stated in {{previous}} submissions to Government, the Associations acknowledge Government’s desire to protect telecommunications infrastructure {{and the information}} transmitted across it from <b>unauthorised</b> access and <b>interference.</b> Indeed, Australian Carriers, Carriage Service Providers and Carriage Service Intermediaries (C/CSPs) and other industry participants have an active and vested interest in ensuring that the nation’s networks and communications infrastructure are robust and resistant to external attack. Industry is, however, unable to support the proposed Telecommunications Sector Security Reform (TSSR), {{as described in the}} exposure draft legislation, for reasons including that it constitutes regulatory ‘over-reach’ {{in the form of a}} framework that: 	will face challenges protecting communications networks, i. e. it will not deliver the increased protection the proposed reforms are aiming to achieve; 	is out of step with regulatory approaches to protecting networks adopted in other countries, including the UK, USA and Canada, thereby putting Australia at a disadvantage in fighting cyber threats and undermine Industry’s ability to support these important peers; 	hands unjustifiably significant additional and intrusive powers to Government and places regulatory burdens on Industry that will undermine its ability to protect against and respond to cyber attacks; 	risks being highly disruptive to the deployment of new network technologies that are more robust in preventing cyber attacks; 	will be a significant deterrent to technological investment in Australia; 	imposes additional costs on Industry and (ultimately) consumers undermining Australia’s competitiveness at a time when digital innovation is an important area for growth for Australia; 	fails to offer protection/indemnity to C/CSPs against the risk of civil litigation through ‘safe harbours’, thereby limiting information sharing and the ability to quickly respond to threats and to jointly engage in preventative action; 	carries the risk that competition in infrastructure supply will be reduced, to the detriment of all Australians; 	lacks transparency; and 	fails to provide adequate consultative mechanisms and avenues of appeal...|$|R
