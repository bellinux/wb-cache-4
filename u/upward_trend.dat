5|$|The {{species is}} {{formally}} designated as 'Nationally Rare' in the United Kingdom and categorised as a 'Species of Principal Importance' {{in accordance with}} the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006. The Tansy Beetle Action Group was set up in 2008 to initiate and oversee conservation efforts and comprises representatives from the University of York, North Yorkshire County Council, City of York Council, Environment Agency and the National Trust. A recovery programme started, involving annual surveys of both tansy and beetles, control of tree shading and invasive plants that compete with tansy, such as Himalayan balsam, and limited re-introductions within the current species range. New clumps of tansy have been planted, particularly between isolated existing patches which may be beyond the 200m walking range of the beetle. In order to publicise the conservation project Rachael Maskell, the Member of Parliament for the constituency of York Central became a 'Tansy Beetle Species Champion' in 2016. That same year, a team of 30 volunteers surveyed a 90km stretch of the banks of the River Ouse.

40|$|<b>Upward</b> <b>trends</b> in {{incidence}} and mortality from primary liver cancer {{have been reported}} from Japan, the USA and a few European countries. Thus, we systematically reviewed trends in age-standardised death certification rates from primary liver cancer between 1970 and 1996 in 20 European countries providing data for the World Health Organisation database. Overall age-standardised (world population) mortality rates were approximately stable or showed no consistent trends in seven countries, including Bulgaria and Hungary (with exceedingly high rates), Finland, The Netherlands and the UK. Moderate rises were observed in Austria, Germany and Switzerland, and much larger <b>upward</b> <b>trends</b> in France and Italy, particularly for males. Downward trends were observed in both sexes in Belgium, Spain, Ireland, Greece and several Scandinavian countries. The per cent change in rates per year ranged, for males, from - 7. 4 % for Ireland and - 5. 1 % for Spain to + 4. 4 % for Italy and + 8. 6 % for France. Trends were more favourable in women, with 15 out of 20 countries showing downward trends in rates, and moderately more favourable in middle age (45 - 64 years) and, in major European countries, in young adults (20 - 44 years of age). In conclusion, trends in liver cancer mortality in Europe are heterogeneous. The fall in mortality in countries like Spain may be largely explained by improvements in the distinction between primary and secondary liver neoplasms, whereas <b>upward</b> <b>trends</b> in Central Europe and Italy are likely to be, at least in part, real.

40|$|Background: The {{different}} {{spread of}} tobacco smoking across European countries {{has caused a}} substantial variability in lung cancer mortality. The objective {{of this investigation was}} to analyse the trends in lung cancer mortality rates in three broad European regions (Northern and Western countries, Eastern countries, and Mediterranean countries) {{during the second half of}} the 20 th century. Patients and methods: Mortality data were obtained from the World Health Organisation database. Lung cancer mortality rates were age-standardised by the direct method to the world standard population. Trends from 1955 to 1997 were assessed by means of joinpoint regression analysis. Results: In men, rates in Eastern Europe increased to reach in the 1990 s the highest values ever registered, while downward trends were observed in Northern and Western Europe since 1979, and in Mediterranean countries since the 1990 s. In women, <b>upward</b> <b>trends</b> were observed in the three regions considered for the whole period. Conclusions: Different smoking prevalences over time explain the shift of almost one decade in the trends in Mediterranean men as compared with Northern and other Western European men.
