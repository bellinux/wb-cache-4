40|$|As is {{the case}} after most wars, {{there has been a}} flood of {{material}} of varying quality on the so-called “BushWar”. Much of this material is written by lay historians. The method of the historian is explained in an attempt to clarify why it is more difficult and more time-consuming for the historian to produce history, than it is for the journalist to produce popular-historical literature. The task of the historian can be facilitated by improving the accessibility of documents. However, the <b>unauthorized</b> <b>destruction</b> of documents, official papers in private possession, document security, inadequate or fragmentary primary sources, and the existance of relatively few memoirs and autobiographies can prove problematic. The writer suggests that a general amnesty for soldiers, increased flexibility with regard to security and the closer involvement {{on the part of the}} soldier on the ground, will go a long way to improving the conditions under which military historical research takes place. </p...|$|E

25|$|Cryptography can {{introduce}} security problems {{when it is}} not implemented correctly. Cryptographic solutions need to be implemented using industry accepted solutions that have undergone rigorous peer review by independent experts in cryptography. The length and strength of the encryption key is also an important consideration. A key that is weak or too short will produce weak encryption. The keys used for encryption and decryption must be protected with the same degree of rigor as any other confidential information. They must be protected from <b>unauthorized</b> disclosure and <b>destruction</b> and they must be available when needed. Public key infrastructure (PKI) solutions address many of the problems that surround key management.|$|R
50|$|Many modern {{computer}} systems provide methods for protecting files against accidental and deliberate damage. Computers {{that allow for}} multiple users implement file permissions to control {{who may or may}} not modify, delete, or create files and folders. For example, a given user may be granted only permission to read a file or folder, but not to modify or delete it; or a user may be given permission to read and modify files or folders, but not to execute them. Permissions may also be used to allow only certain users to see the contents of a file or folder. Permissions protect against <b>unauthorized</b> tampering or <b>destruction</b> of information in files, and keep private information confidential from unauthorized users.|$|R
40|$|CDATA[Security is a {{big concern}} for any {{business}} on the Internet, since data is being transported over the network, {{making it possible for}} outsiders to snoop and derive critical information. Security violations (misuse) of the system can be categorized as being either intentional (malicious) or accidental. It is easier to protect against accidental misuse than to protect against malicious misuse. Among the forms of malicious access are unauthorized reading of data (theft of information), unauthorized modification of data, <b>unauthorized</b> <b>destruction</b> of data. A major security problem for electronic transaction is the authentication problem (prevent any person or object from masquerading as some other person or object). There are some other issues that confront us in relation to securing electronic transactions are therefore: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability and Auditability. Implementing a security solution in an Electronic Commerce environment therefore, necessitates a Risk Analysis of the business scenario. In some cases, confidentiality might be an extremely critical issue whereas in others it may only be data integrity that is of paramount importance. We have tried to develop a security technique for electronic transactions in Symmetric Cryptosystem. ]]...|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] Modern medical {{equipments}} produce mass {{digital images}} and data everyday [1]. In addition to diagnosis, these images {{also serve as}} valid document evidences in legal trials and insurance claims and as well as education material for illustrations in medical research etc. The integrity of such records needs be protected from <b>unauthorized</b> modification or <b>destruction</b> of information. One of the security measures {{that can be used}} is watermarking. It has become an important research area in the field of data security, confidentiality and integrity. Also, in applications like tele-medicine, confidentiality and integrity of a medical image can be achieved by hiding the Electronic Patient Record (EPR data) in corresponding medical images. However, in the medical images the diagnostic quality is very critical and should not be compromised. The objective {{of this paper is to}} discuss some of the most efficient techniques suitable for watermarking of medical images. These methods are reversible in nature, i. e, complete information without distortion can be recovered. The techniques are based on modified difference expansion and CDCS. These techniques aim at increasing the data hiding capacity, without distortion of diagnostically important information. Mechanism for ROI authentication and temper detection is also provided to judge its integrity and fidelity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Text fusion is {{the process}} of hiding the text behind the image pixels. In this paper we study about the {{technique}} of fusing the text data i. e. patient record in the medical image like X-Ray or Ultra sound. We can maintain Electronic Patient record (EPR). Now days we store and exchange medical images over internet for purpose of diagnosis. It helps us for long term data storages of the EPR. This technique has been proposed to increase medical image security, confidentiality and integrity. It provides confidentiality, integrity and authentication to these images. In addition to diagnosis, these medical images also used as valid document for legal trials and insurance claims and as well as education material for illustrations in medical research etc. The integrity provides from <b>unauthorized</b> modification or <b>destruction</b> of information of such records needs be protected. One way by we can provide security measures that can be used is watermarking. It became an important research area in the many fields of data security, confidentiality and integrity. The objective {{of this paper is to}} discuss some of the techniques suitable for text fusion of medical images. These techniques are reversible in nature, i. e we can recover complete information as it is without distortion these techniques aim at increasing the data hiding capacity, without distortion of diagnostically important information...|$|R
40|$|Street art, in its {{original}} and purest form, is artwork created without authorization, usually illegally, on either private or public property. Until recently, street art has been considered a social nuisance and is almost universally illegal, but it is now slowly becoming a “hot commodity” garnering press and social media attention. In recent years, local communities are increasingly beginning to value street art in their neighborhoods, and the art world has also caught on to the street art trend. As a result, street art is being copied and reprinted on clothing, posters, commercial items, and exhibited and sold in auction houses and galleries. Cities, such as Bristol, Bethlehem, and Taichung, are embracing street art by offering guided tours {{to show off their}} famous street art. Street art—no longer considered merely a social nuisance as it once was—is now becoming the “next big thing” in the art world and market. As street art evolves into commodity, the questions naturally are: who owns street art, and should intellectual property law protect street art from unauthorized copying, removal and sale, or destruction? This Paper attempts to answer these questions under U. S. law and under recent scholarship examining “negative spaces” in intellectual property. Specifically, this Paper concludes that street artists could attempt to use U. S. copyright law and VARA to protect their artwork from <b>unauthorized</b> copying and <b>destruction.</b> However, {{due to the nature of}} street art, and the ethos of street artists, intellectual property law is not an effective way to protect street art. Nevertheless, as has been evident in the past decade, innovation and creativity in street art will thrive even without the artificial exclusivity created by intellectual property. Street artists have been protecting their work through normative rules developed over the years, and communities are also looking for creative ways to protect street art from being destroyed or removed from their neighborhoods. The concern that the lack of formal intellectual property protection will “discourage” street art’s creation is not a valid justification to impose or create stronger intellectual property protection for street art. Economic incentives are not necessary to motivate the creation—or the continued creative output—of street art. The evidence of this can be found on the streets of any big city, where street art continues to flourish in a norms-based, low-IP world...|$|R
