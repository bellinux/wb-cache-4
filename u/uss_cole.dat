5|$|Mihdhar {{was born}} in Saudi Arabia and fought in the Bosnian War during the 1990s. In early 1999, he {{traveled}} to Afghanistan where, as an experienced and respected jihadist, he was selected by Osama bin Laden {{to participate in the}} attacks. Mihdhar arrived in California with fellow hijacker Nawaf al-Hazmi in January 2000, after traveling to Malaysia for the Kuala Lumpur al-Qaeda Summit. At this point, the CIA was aware of Mihdhar, and he was photographed in Malaysia with another al-Qaeda member who was involved in the <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing. The CIA did not inform the FBI when it learned that Mihdhar and Hazmi had entered the United States, and Mihdhar was not placed on any watchlists until late August 2001.|$|E

50|$|Robustelli {{was born}} on December 6, 1925 in Stamford, Connecticut, to Lucien Robustelli, an Italian-American and his wife Catherine Robustelli. He {{attended}} Stamford High School, where he excelled in football and baseball. At age 18, he enlisted in the United States Navy and served on the <b>USS</b> William C. <b>Cole</b> in the Pacific Theater. After the war, he attended Arnold College, in Milford, Connecticut, where he played both football and baseball. After college, he was drafted in the NFL by the Los Angeles Rams in the nineteenth round of the 1951 NFL Draft. In June, 1951, he was offered a tryout with the New York Giants baseball club. The Giants offered Robustelli a $400 contract to play with their minor league affiliate Knoxville Smokies.|$|R
25|$|Ramzi bin al-Shibh is {{suspected}} of having {{been involved in the}} 2000 <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing, and the 2002 Ghriba synagogue bombing in Tunisia.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the attack}} on the <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> and 11 September 2001 {{terrorist}} attacks, the base had some major upgrades to its security gates, costing more than $12.5 million.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, the <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing {{encouraged}} {{several members}} to depart. Mohammed Atef went to escape Kandahar, Zawahiri to Kabul, and Bin Laden fled to Kabul, later joining Atef when he realised no American reprisal attacks were forthcoming.|$|E
25|$|Next {{came the}} 2000 {{millennium}} attack plots, which included an attempted bombing of Los Angeles International Airport. On 12 October 2000, the <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing occurred near {{the port of}} Yemen, and 17 U.S. Navy sailors were killed.|$|E
25|$|Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri was interrogated {{numerous}} times. In 2007 he attributed his {{confessions of}} involvement in the <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing to torture, including waterboarding. All the details Abd al-Rahim offered of his claims of torture were redacted from his transcript.|$|E
25|$|Al-Manar was {{the first}} TV station to report Hezbollah's {{condemnation}} of the September 11 attacks. Other non-state attacks against the United States have also been condemned on Al Manar, including the 2000 <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing suicide attack against a US Navy destroyer.|$|E
25|$|On 3 November 2002, a Hellfire missile {{was fired}} at {{a car in}} Yemen, killing Qaed Salim Sinan al-Harethi, an al-Qaeda leader thought to be {{responsible}} for the <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing. It was the first direct U.S. strike in the War on Terrorism outside Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|On 3 February 2006, 23 {{suspected}} or convicted Al-Qaeda members {{escaped from}} jail in Yemen. This number included 13 who {{were convicted of}} the bombings of <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> and the French tanker Limburg in 2002. Among those who reportedly escaped was Al-Badawi. Al-Qaeda's Yemeni number two Abu Assem al-Ahdal may also have escaped.|$|E
25|$|On October 12, 2000, al-Qaeda {{militants in}} Yemen bombed the missile {{destroyer}} <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> in a suicide attack, killing 17 U.S. servicemen and damaging the vessel while it lay offshore. Inspired {{by the success}} of such a brazen attack, al-Qaeda's command core began to prepare for an attack on the U.S. itself.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2000 <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing, Atef {{was moved}} to Kandahar, Zawahiri to Kabul, and Bin Laden fled to Kabul, later joining Atef when he {{realised}} no American reprisal attacks were forthcoming. Whenever al-Qaeda organised games of volleyball, Atef and Bin Laden were forced to be on separate teams since they were both tall, and good players.|$|E
25|$|Following Yemeni {{unification}} in 1990, Wahhabi networks {{began moving}} missionaries {{into the country}} {{in an effort to}} subvert the capitalist north. Although it is unlikely that bin Laden or Saudi al-Qaeda were directly involved, the personal connections they made would be established over the next decade and used in the <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing. Concerns grow over Al Qaeda's group in Yemen.|$|E
25|$|After {{the fall}} of the Taliban regime, many members of the Taliban {{resistance}} fled to the Northern border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan where the Pakistani army had previously little control. With the logistics and air support of the United States, the Pakistani Army captured or killed numerous al-Qaeda operatives such as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, wanted for his involvement in the <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing, the Bojinka plot, and the killing of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl.|$|E
25|$|Naval Station Norfolk is homeport for the , {{which was}} the victim of an Al-Qaeda {{terrorist}} attack in October 2000 while it was harbored and being refueled in the port of Aden, Yemen. 17 American sailors were killed, and 39 were injured in the attack, which was later revealed to have been a dress rehearsal for future terror attacks by the group in the United States. The <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> remains in active service and remains homeported at Norfolk.|$|E
25|$|Saudi Arabia's {{relations}} with the West began to cause growing concern {{among some of the}} ulema and students of sharia law {{and was one of the}} issues that led to an increase in Islamist terrorism in Saudi Arabia, as well as Islamist terrorist attacks in Western countries by Saudi nationals. Osama bin Laden was a Saudi national (until stripped of his nationality in 1994) and was responsible for the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in East Africa and the 2000 <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing near the port of Aden, Yemen. 15 of the 19 terrorists involved in September 11 attacks in New York City, Washington, D.C., and near Shanksville, Pennsylvania were Saudi nationals. Many Saudis who did not support the Islamist terrorists were nevertheless deeply unhappy with the government's policies.|$|E
25|$|McGraw {{designed}} a charity T-shirt sold through Angelwear to benefit MusiCares. MusiCares supports musicians {{in times of}} need. His charity focus particularly on health issues. The Tim McGraw Foundation raises funds to {{enhance the quality of}} life of children and adults with brain tumors. He supports the Muhammad Ali Parkinson Center, the David Foster Foundation, which helps families of children in need of organ transplants, and Musicians on Call, which brings music to hospital patients' bedsides. He also performs during dinners and auctions to benefit children with disabilities. Hill and McGraw gave the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society $375,000 (the entire gate receipts from one of their concerts) to assist the families of 17 sailors following the terrorist attack on <b>USS</b> <b>Cole,</b> the guided missile destroyer that suffered significant damage in the Gulf of Aden, Yemen on October 12, 2000.|$|E
25|$|While the CIA {{insists that}} those who {{conducted}} the attacks on 9/11 were not aware that the agency was operating at 7 World Trade Center {{under the guise of}} another (unidentified) federal agency, this center was the headquarters for many notable criminal terrorism investigations. Though the New York field offices' main responsibilities were to monitor and recruit foreign officials stationed at the United Nations, the field office also handled the investigations of the August 1998 bombings of United States Embassies in East Africa and the October 2000 bombing of the <b>USS</b> <b>Cole.</b> Despite the fact that the CIA's New York branch may have been damaged by the 9/11 attacks and they had to loan office space from the US Mission to the United Nations and other federal agencies, there was an upside for the CIA. In the months immediately following 9/11, there was a huge increase in the amount of applications for CIA positions. According to CIA representatives that spoke with The New York Times, pre-9/11 the agency received approximately 500 to 600 applications a week, in the months following 9/11 the agency received that number daily.|$|E
500|$|In Malaysia, {{the group}} stayed with Yazid Sufaat, a local Jemaah Islamiyah member, who {{provided}} accommodation at Hambali's request. [...] Both Mihdhar and Hazmi were secretly photographed {{at the meeting}} by Malaysian authorities, whom the CIA had asked to provide surveillance. [...] The Malaysians reported that Mihdhar spoke at length with Attash, and he met with Fahd al-Quso and others who were later involved in the <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing. [...] After the meeting, Mihdhar and Hazmi traveled to Bangkok, Thailand on January 8 and left a week later on January 15 for the United States.|$|E
500|$|After the attacks, the {{identification}} of Mihdhar {{was one of the}} first links suggesting that Bin Laden had played a role in their organization, since Mihdhar had been seen at the Malaysian conference speaking to Bin Laden's associates. [...] The FBI interrogated Quso, who was arrested following the <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing and in custody in Yemen. [...] Quso was able to identify Mihdhar, Hazmi and Attash in photos provided by the FBI, and he also knew Marwan al-Shehhi, a hijacker aboard United Airlines Flight 175. [...] From Quso, the FBI was able to establish an al-Qaeda link to the attacks.|$|E
500|$|Mihdhar and Hazmi {{moved out}} of the Parkwood Apartments at the end of May 2000, and Mihdhar {{transferred}} registration for the Toyota Corolla to Hazmi. [...] On June 10, 2000, Mihdhar left the United States and returned to Yemen to visit his wife, against the wishes of Mohammed who wanted him to remain in the United States to help Hazmi adapt. [...] Mohammed was so angered by this that he decided to remove Mihdhar from the 9/11 plot, but he was overruled by Bin Laden. Mihdhar remained part of the plot as a muscle hijacker, who would help take over the aircraft. [...] On October 12, 2000, the <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> was bombed by a small boat laden with explosives. After the bombing, Yemeni Prime Minister Abdul Karim al-Iryani reported that Mihdhar {{had been one of the}} key planners of the attack and had been in the country at the time of the attacks. [...] In late 2000, Mihdhar was back in Saudi Arabia, staying with a cousin in Mecca.|$|E
500|$|On 8 March, Thomas {{was interviewed}} again by {{two members of}} the AFP, who had made special {{arrangements}} with the Pakistani Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to have the interview conducted pursuant to Australian law, particularly the requirements of the federal Evidence Act 1995 and Crimes Act 1914, so that admissible evidence could be gathered. ISI allowed the interview, but with a very limited timeframe, and did not allow Thomas to have access to legal advice. During this interview, Thomas made several self-incriminatory statements, which were key to his later convictions and the admissibility of which was the central issue in the appeal. In the statements, Thomas admitted that he had tampered with his passport to conceal the amount of time he had been in Pakistan, and also admitted that the money and airline ticket had been given to him by Tawfiq bin Attash, a high ranking Al Qaeda lieutenant involved with the 1998 United States embassy bombings and the <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing. On 10 March, the AFP wrote again to the ISI, reiterating the requirements of the Australian legislation, and saying that [...] "the admissibility of [...] in Australian Courts has been seriously compromised." ...|$|E
500|$|McCain did join Bush for a {{few days}} of {{appearances}} in late October, emphasizing, {{in the wake of the}} October 12 <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing, his belief that Bush was a better choice than Democratic Party nominee Al Gore to deal with international security threats. [...] Bush aide Scott McClellan later described the joint appearances by saying, [...] "The tension was palpable. The two were cordial, but McCain would get that forced smile on his face whenever they were together." [...] McCain also campaigned for about forty Republican House of Representatives candidates, and was credited by National Republican Congressional Committee chair Tom Davis with keeping the House in Republican hands. [...] McCain would state that he voted for Bush on November 7 (although years later several witnesses would relate that McCain and his wife Cindy had both said at a dinner party that they had not). [...] When the November presidential election continued on in indecision during the Florida election dispute, McCain stayed generally quiet in an atmosphere of extreme partisanship, though he did appear on CBS' Face the Nation to say, [...] "I think the nation is growing a little weary of this. [...] We're not in a constitutional crisis, but the American people are growing weary, and whoever wins is having a rapidly diminishing mandate, to say the least." [...] Once Bush was declared the winner and inaugurated in January 2001, McCain's battles with him would resume, with a significant amount of lingering bitterness between the two men and their staffs over what had transpired during the course of 2000.|$|E
