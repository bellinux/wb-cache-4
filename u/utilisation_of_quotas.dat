40|$|To explain over- and underuse <b>of</b> {{available}} <b>quota,</b> Buysse et al. (2007) have integrated {{the shadow}} cost <b>of</b> the <b>quota</b> constraint in a quota flexibility {{function in a}} positive mathematical programming model. This method and central hypothesis, formulated and tested for the case of Belgian sugar beet farms, is in current paper extended and confirmed for the cases <b>of</b> Flemish dairy <b>quota</b> and manure emission rights. Despite the different organisation, objectives and implementations <b>of</b> the diverse <b>quota</b> systems, the results are similar. A higher <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> is significantly driven by the quota rent, but farm characteristics are also important and the effect declines with increasing quota rent. Regardless the quota, the dairy <b>quota</b> flexibility behaviour <b>of</b> the sample of Flemish farms results in an output price elasticity of 0. 6 %. The quota flexibility functions {{can be used for}} policy analysis, model sophistication and farm advisory instrument.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on {{energetic}} <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> biomass. It was used a qualitative research and document analysis of articles. The first part deals with the theoretical framework, therefore definitions and possibilities <b>of</b> biomass <b>utilisation.</b> The second part contains methodology, follows research and its evaluation. The first aim of this thesis is to summarize the <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> biomass as renewable energy and to distinguish positive and negative impacts <b>of</b> the <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> this source and evaluate its economic efficiency. There are several possibilities <b>of</b> <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> biomass, but {{it is necessary to}} select the suitable process and its utilisation. Based on the large number of examples from life it can be stated that it is economically efficient. The second aim is to identify main misconceptions related to <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> biomass. The main misconception is comparing the <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> solar energy, which has not left positive attitude of people to renewable energy, with <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> biomass. There are few examples of comparing photovoltaic with <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> biomass on the same level. In regard of the basic principles <b>of</b> <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> biomass, those two sources cannot be compared at all, they are not similar. Another misconception is apprehension of appropriation of land used for growing energy [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the inefficiencies {{associated with the}} regionalisation <b>of</b> milk <b>quota</b> trade. An optimisation model is developed to estimate the economic value <b>of</b> <b>quota.</b> Quota values are aggregated to derive supply and demand curves under two scenarios; first where quotas can trade nationally and second where the trade <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> is regionally restricted. Quota trade is simulated and the consequent effects on supplier structure are estimated. Through the derivation of sectoral cumulative cost curves {{it is possible to}} estimate the impact <b>of</b> regionalising <b>quota</b> trade on sector efficiency. The model is solved using National Farm Survey data from Ireland and the inefficiencies <b>of</b> regionalised <b>quota</b> trade in Ireland is estimated at€ 20 million. The model is also used to quantify the effect of policy uncertainty on quota trade. The implications of an early abolition or expansion of the EU milk quota on quota trade is quantified. The paper concludes by discussing the implications <b>of</b> restricted <b>quota</b> trade, especially in the context <b>of</b> eventual <b>quota</b> removal...|$|R

40|$|Malawi {{is among}} the five sub-sahara Africa {{presenting}} with very high maternal mortality rates, 984 per 100, 000 live. Inadequate access to and under-utilisation of quality maternal health care services {{was identified as a}} major reasons for poor health of the women in Malawi. As a response to this situation, the Malawi government initiated the implementation of skilled attendance approach to delivery of maternal health care in 2006. The main objectives {{of the study was to}} identify the patterns and determinants <b>of</b> <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> skilled attendace for maternal health care services in the catchment areas of two rural health centres in the northern part of Malawi. This study used methodological triangulation methods, quantitative study using a descriptive cross sectional survey and qualitative; semistructured interviews and observations. Results shows that, <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> maternal health care services at the study sites has improved compared to the 2004 demographic health survey reports on maternal health care service utilisation in Malawi. <b>Utilisation</b> <b>of</b> skilled care for child birth was much higher than of the other components of maternal health care services. Maternal health services at Bolero health centre seemed to be more accessible and available than at kande. Hence <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> most components of care were high at Bolero health centre. Higher odds for <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> skilled care at birth was associated with women who made atleast 4 antenatal care visit, who lived within 5 km from the health centre. Low <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> maternal health care was associated with womens’ low autonomy; women with lower levels of education, younger, married, had lower rates <b>of</b> <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> most components of maternal health care. The malawian strategy of implementing skilled attendance achieved is unique as it aims apromoting total <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> skilled care, some lessons can be learnt on how the implementation is done at Bolero health centre. However, provision of quality of care remains a challenge for Malawi. There is need for strengthening supportive supervision and human resource management systems...|$|R

In addition to West European countries, we have included 3 Eastern European countries: Hungary, Estonia and Latvia. To cover the gap in knowledge we pay a special attention to the magnitude of inequalities among patients with chronic conditions. Methods Data on the use of GP and specialist services were derived from national health surveys of Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, the Netherlands and Norway. For each country and education level we calculated the absolute prevalence and relative inequalities in <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> GP and specialist services. In order to account for the need for care, the results were adjusted by the measure of self-assessed health. Results People with lower education used GP services equally often in most countries (except Belgium and Germany) compared with those with a higher level of education. At the same time people with a higher education used specialist care services significantly more often in all countries, except in the Netherlands. The general pattern of educational inequalities in <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> specialist care was similar for both men and women.
