Cloud storages give a {{convenient}} way for keeping <b>user?s</b> digital <b>multimedia</b> <b>data</b> (images, {{audio and video}} data), and they {{are becoming more and}} more popular among a large number of users. However in case of using cloud storage that doesn?t guarantee data protection a threat of unauthorized access to <b>user?s</b> personal <b>multimedia</b> <b>data</b> appears. The application of existing protection methods to <b>multimedia</b> <b>data</b> in clouds isn?t appropriate, because, firstly, they don?t take into account the specific properties of <b>multimedia</b> <b>data,</b> and secondly, they aren?t oriented to needs of a usual user. In particular, time of data processing during encryption and decryption isn?t usually considered as a characteristic of data protection software, though it?s important for a user. Therefore the development of specific methods of <b>multimedia</b> <b>data</b> protection is a topical task. In this paper a new steganography method of data protection in audio-files is proposed, it?s based on storing a complimentary image instead of stegodata as well as on the use of a modified Latin square as a key.

The {{expansion of the}} internet and the spread of mobile devices allow users the utilization of <b>multimedia</b> <b>data</b> everywhere. <b>Multimedia</b> <b>data</b> collections tend to grow continuously and are thus no longer manually manageable by humans. As a result, multimedia retrieval approaches that allow efficient information access to massive <b>multimedia</b> <b>data</b> collections become immensely important. These approaches support <b>users</b> in searching <b>multimedia</b> <b>data</b> collections in a content-based way based on a similarity model. A similarity model defines the similarity between <b>multimedia</b> <b>data</b> objects and is the core of each multimedia retrieval approach.

This paper introduces a new P-recursive sequence and two multimedia scrambling algorithms {{based on the}} P-recursive sequence. The P-recursive sequence is a more generalized sequence which can derive many well-known sequences such as the P-Fibonacci sequence, the P-Lucas sequence and P-Gray code. The algorithms {{can be used to}} scramble two or three dimensional <b>multimedia</b> <b>data</b> in one step. Electronic signatures, grayscale images and three-color-component images are all examples of 2 -D & 3 -D <b>multimedia</b> <b>data</b> which can utilize these algorithms. Furthermore, a security key parameter p may be chosen as different or the same values for each dimensional component of the <b>multimedia</b> <b>data.</b> Experiments show that the presented algorithms can scramble <b>multimedia</b> <b>data</b> at different levels of security by partially or fully encrypting <b>multimedia</b> <b>data.</b> They also have been demonstrated in the experiments to show good performance in known-plain text attack and common image attacks such as data loss, Gaussian noise, and Salt Pepper noise.

40|$|Technologies {{such as the}} World Wide Web have {{resulted}} in the access of information over a global network. Data can be text, images, video, or sound. Current network limitations and the large size of data items result in a high response time - the time taken for an image to be transmitted from a remote site to the user. In this paper we focus on reducing this response time for images. Traditionally in an information system exact copies of text data items had to be retrieved for the <b>user</b> but <b>multimedia</b> <b>data</b> items such as video and images can be represented by an equivalent data item which is an approximation of the original data item. Such an equivalent data item might satisfy an application equally well and also have a lower response time.

40|$|Social {{media has}} {{received}} extensive attention recently {{and has become}} a very popular research area due to its wide spectrum of applications. We note that even though the whole area of social media is very popular in the literature, there are a group of research issues that are related to the social-cultural constraints in the social media study that have not yet received sufficient attention. In this context, we group all these issues together under the umbrella of a new sub-area of social media that we call connected multimedia. Consequently, by connected multimedia, we mean the study of the social and technical interactions among <b>users,</b> <b>multimedia</b> <b>data,</b> and devices across cultures and the explicit exploitation of cultural differences. Hence, connected multimedia involves the three elements – the <b>users,</b> the <b>multimedia</b> <b>data,</b> and the devices – with two perspectives – the social focus and the cultural focus. In short, connected multimedia is about multimedia content and connection across community and cultural boundaries. In comparison with those existing research areas including social media as its super-area and human centered computing, we here emphasize that connected multimedia pays more attention to the cultural difference. The definition of the social side is broader than just national cultures; it possibly includes cultures of groups, disciplines, organizations, communities, ethnicities, religions, and nations. This emphasis distinguishes connected multimedia from all other existing areas such as social media and cross-media, which may either claim to include some of these aspects, among many others, or have different foci. This special section is organized following the successful first two editions of the workshop on the newly emerged theme of connected multimedia held in Hangzhou, China, in October of 2009 and in Florence, Italy, in October, 2010. After two rounds of rigorous reviews for all the submissions in response to the CFP of this special section, we have finally selected three papers to be included in this special section on connected multimedia. The paper “Association of Moving Objects across Visual Sensor Networks” by M. J. Mirza and N. Anjum presents an inter-camera trajectory association algorithm for partially overlapping visual sensor networks; the paper addresses issues related to trajectory extraction, representation, and association. The paper “Faceted Subtopic Retrieval: Exploiting the Topic Hierarchy via a Multi-Modal Framework” by J. Sang and C. Xu presents a new framework for multi-modal analysis and retrieval called faceted subtopic retrieval that is tailored to complex queries to the social media data on the Web concerning political and social events or issues. A LDA-like model is developed to exploit the intrinsic topic hierarchy inside the retrieved data. The paper “Tour Route Recommendation Begins with Multimodal Classification” by X. Chen and Q. Wang addresses the problem of location estimation for tourist photos; the paper proposes a solution that begins with classification and exploits explicitly the textual, temporal, geographic, and visual information together for a tour route recommendation. Overall, all the three papers address the theory and application case studies on the general topic of connected multimedia. While this editorial is co-authored by the guest-editors who also organized the two editions of the workshop on the same topic that actually led to this special section, many people have contributed the ideas that have finally {{led to the development of}} this topic of connected multimedia in the literature. Specifically, Noshir Contractor, Alan Hanjalic, Alexander G. Hauptmann, Xian-Sheng Hua, Alejandro (Alex) Jaimes, Ivan Ivanov, Michael S. Lew, Wanqing Li, Ching-Yung Ling, Alexander C. Loui, Jiebo Luo, Michael W. Macy, Nicu Sebe, Qi Tian, Yonghong Tian, Vincent S. Tseng, Qing Wang, Changsheng Xu, Huimin Yu, and Shiwen Yu deserve the credit for contributing their ideas to the development of the literature on this topic. Finally, we would like to thank Dr. Jie Yang, US NSF Program Manager, for the support to the development of this effort and Dr. Jiebo Luo, the EIC of Journal of Multimedia, for the support to publishing this special section. We also acknowledge US NSF (through grant IIS- 0956924), Zhejiang University College of Computer Science and Technology, Microsoft Research, and ACM for sponsoring the two editions of the workshop on connected multimedia that led to this special section.

The efficiency of this technique depends strongly on the tags associated to pictures, as well as their accuracy.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} a <b>multimedia</b> <b>data</b> {{management}} framework using GeM-Tree. GeM-Tree is a multidimensional tree-based index structure {{which provides a}} generalized framework to organize and retrieve images and videos seamlessly. In addition to supporting different <b>multimedia</b> <b>data</b> types and diverse representations, the proposed data management framework supports varied multimedia retrieval strategies like content-based image and video retrieval, mixed <b>multimedia</b> <b>data</b> retrieval where cross-similarity between images and videos is considered, region-based retrieval, etc. The framework embeds a high-level semantic relationship between <b>multimedia</b> <b>data</b> objects with a construct called Hierarchical Markov Model Mediator via a novel affinity promotion technique to improve query result relevance manifold. Extensive experiments were conducted with different <b>multimedia</b> <b>data</b> types possessing varied representations, different retrieval approaches, and different data sizes. The encouraging results demonstrate a potential solution to the important and complex issue of managing a large volume of <b>multimedia</b> <b>data.</b> Index Terms — <b>multimedia</b> <b>data</b> management, content-based retrieval, generalized index structure, varied feature distri-butions I...|$|R
40|$|Unicast {{mechanisms}} for the adaptive transmission of <b>multimedia</b> <b>data</b> {{can be used}} for the transmission of <b>multimedia</b> <b>data</b> over heterogeneous networks, like the Internet with the use of one unicast stream for each receiver. Those mechanisms have the capability to adapt the transmission of the <b>multimedia</b> <b>data</b> to network changes. In this paper, we describe a unicast mechanism for adaptive transmission of <b>multimedia</b> <b>data,</b> which is based on real time protocols. The proposed mechanism {{can be used for}} unicast transmission of <b>multimedia</b> <b>data</b> over heterogeneous networks, like the Internet, and has the capability to adapt the transmission of the <b>multimedia</b> <b>data</b> to network changes. Moreover, the proposed mechanism uses a “friendly ” to the network users congestion control policy to control the transmission of the <b>multimedia</b> <b>data.</b> We evaluate the adaptive multicast transmission mechanism and we compare it with a number of similar mechanisms available to the literature (LBA, RAP, and TFRCP) ...|$|R
40|$|Semantic <b>data</b> {{modeling}} of <b>multimedia</b> <b>data</b> {{is a fundamental}} problem in multimedia databases. The variety, context-dependency, and ambiguity of the semantics of <b>multimedia</b> <b>data</b> create the difficulty of applying conventional data modeling techniques, which usually deal with explicit, self-contained alphanumeric data. Many semantic data modeling techniques are either explicitly proposed for multimedia or {{can be used for}} modeling <b>multimedia</b> <b>data.</b> Specifically, we describe MediaView as a novel object-oriented view mechanism that can successfully capture the elusive nature of <b>multimedia</b> <b>data.</b> In this chapter, we firstly describe the problem of semantic multimedia modeling and the dilemma of applying traditional data modeling techniques on <b>multimedia</b> <b>data.</b> We then present a brief review of the related techniques on semantic and <b>multimedia</b> <b>data</b> modeling. The MediaView mechanism is described in details and some of its applications are discussed...|$|R
