Unlike existing solutions which perform delivery adaptation {{by adjusting the}} original multimedia quality to varying network conditions, this solution is based on dynamic buffer occupancy estimation for multiple streams to achieve its goal. The proposed scheme and three other approaches are compared in terms of estimated <b>user</b> perceived <b>quality.</b> Simulation results show how this scheme outperforms the other solutions including {{when the number of}} simultaneous receivers increases significantly.

40|$|International audienceThe quality {{assessment}} of multimedia services {{as perceived by}} the end-user is a challenging task. In a controlled environment, {{it is easy to}} measure the <b>user's</b> <b>Quality</b> of Experience (QoE) against the influence of controlled network parameters. However, in an uncontrolled environment, it is difficult to measure the Quality of Service (QoS) perceived by end-users, due to the unpredictable behaviour of networks. Crowd-sourcing is an emerging technique that can be employed to measure the QoE at the end user, but in an uncontrolled environment. In this paper, we present a tool implementing a crowd-sourcing framework, that measures the QoE of online video streaming, as perceived by end-users. The tool also measures important QoS network parameters in real-time (packet loss, delay, jitter and throughput), retrieves system information (memory, processing power etc.), and other properties of the end-user's system. The proposed approach provides the opportunity to explore the <b>user's</b> <b>quality</b> perception in a wider domain...|$|R

Descriptive comparative analysis of eleven mobile apps comprising an assessment of their alignment with existing evidence on nutrition, behaviour change and <b>user</b> <b>quality,</b> and their potential ability to support healthier food purchasing behaviour. Mobile apps freely available for public use in GoogePlay were assessed and scored according to agreed criteria to assess nutrition content quality and integration of behaviour change theory and <b>user</b> <b>quality</b> components. A sample of eleven mobile apps that met predefined inclusion criteria to ensure relevance and good quality. The quality of the nutrition content varied. Improvements to the accuracy and appropriateness of nutrition content are needed to ensure mobile apps support a healthy behaviour change process and are accessible to a wider population. There appears to be a narrow focus towards behaviour change with an overemphasis on behavioural outcomes and a small number of behaviour change techniques, which may limit effectiveness. A significant effort from the user was required to use the mobile apps appropriately which may negatively influence user acceptability and subsequent utilisation. Existing mobile apps may offer a potentially effective approach to supporting healthier food purchasing behaviour but improvements in mobile app design are required to maximise their potential effectiveness. Engagement of mobile app users and nutrition professionals is recommended to support effective design...|$|E

The objective is to incorporate the quality of sensed data to generate a reliable estimate on the matching scores. The proposed method of extracting <b>user</b> <b>quality</b> is based on the confidence of generating reliable matching scores from the user templates. We simultaneously extract the palmprint and hand-shape images from the single hand image and ascertain the performance improvement for the individual trait. The experimental results from the proposed approach are also presented when the biometric measurements from the finger knuckles are employed. The experimental results presented in this paper show significant improvement in performance while incorporating the proposed method of <b>user</b> <b>quality</b> in the matching stages. The proposed user-quality-based fusion of the two biometric modalities also achieves promising improvement in performance. Department of Computin...|$|E
40|$|Selection of {{software}} packages from user requirements {{is currently a}} central task in software engineering. Selection of inappropriate packages may compromise some business processes and may interfere negatively in {{the functioning of the}} involved organization. Success of package selection is currently endangered because of many factors, being one of the most importants the absence of structured descriptions of both the package features and the <b>user</b> <b>quality</b> requirements. In this paper, we propose a methodology for describing the quality factors {{of software}} packages using the ISO/IEC quality standard as framework. Following this standard, relevant attributes for a specific software domain are identified and structured as a hierarchy, and metrics for them are chosen. Software packages in this domain can be then described in a uniform and comprehensive way. Therefore, selection of packages can be ameliorated by transforming <b>user</b> <b>quality</b> requirements into requirements expressed in terms of the quality model attributes. We illustrate the approach by presenting in some depth a quality model for the mail servers domain. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of Information System (IS) solutions for organizational competitive advantage {{has long been}} recognized {{but many of the}} IS implementations are unable to meet the acceptable IS success criteria. In addition, there are many models and frameworks that have been developed to measure and evaluate the success of IS, but none of them considers the role of user, specifically the <b>user</b> <b>quality</b> and personal characteristics. In this study, an IS success model for mandatory system usage that includes the role of user was proposed. The research design adopted a two-phase methodology comprising exploratory and confirmatory phases. The first phase consisted of identification and specification parts whereas the second phase or the confirmation part tested the proposed model. The proposed model was tested in the hospital Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) {{which is part of the}} Hospital Information System (HIS). A survey instrument was developed and distributed to 249 respondents who are the hospital laboratory staff and users of LIMS of three hospitals in Iran. The results of the analysis showed that in the mandatory system usage in the laboratories of hospitals, the impact of the usage quality on the IS net benefits had an insignificant effect. However, the <b>user</b> <b>quality</b> significantly influenced usage quality and satisfaction quality, while their relationships were moderated by personal characteristics. The user qualities which can be manipulated were knowledge management and information technology capabilities, perception, motivation, and training. On the contrary, personal characteristics such as gender, age, education and experience cannot be manipulated during the research. Finally, these qualities have theoretical contribution as they have introduced and detailed the role of user in terms of <b>user</b> <b>quality</b> and personal characteristics in the IS success model for mandatory system usage in the healthcare context...|$|E
