Sensitive personal information is often stored in the mobile devices. Smart device users use applications with sensitive personal data such as in online banking. To protect personal information, code based screen <b>unlock</b> <b>methods</b> are used so far. However, these methods are vulnerable to shoulder surfing or smudge attacks. To build a secure <b>unlocking</b> <b>methods</b> we propose DragID, a flexible gesture and biometric based user authentication. Based on the human modeling, DragID authenticates users by using 6 input sources of touch screens. From the input sources, we build 25 fine grained features such as origin of hand, finger radius, velocity, gravity, perpendicular and so on. As modeling the human hand, inour method, features such as radius or origin is difficult to imitate. These features are useful for authentication. In order to authenticate, we use a popular machine learning method, support vector machine. This method prevents attackers reproducing the exact same drag patterns. In the experiments, we implemented DragID on Samsung Galaxy Note 2, collected 147379 drag samples from 17 volunteers, and conducted real-world experiments. Our method outperforms Luca’s method and achieves 89. 49 % and 0. 36 % of true positive and false positive. In addition, we achieve 92. 33 % of TPR in case we implement sequence technique. ope...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Authentication {{mechanisms}} are useful when a device is lost or stolen, but ineffective {{when it comes}} to preventing friends and family from snooping through contents. Most <b>unlock</b> authentication <b>methods</b> are vulnerable to observation attacks than can easily be performed by those in a close social circle. Moreover, unlock authentication does not address the common use case of device sharing. Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) are {{based on the assumption that}} a system will eventually be attacked, and are widely used in network systems as an additional security measure that works around authentication flaws. In this paper, we present and evaluate the adequacy of an inconspicu-ous IDPS for Android smartphones, intended to dissuade socially-close adversaries from snooping through device contents. This system runs on the background and attempts to determine, through face recognition, if the device is being operated by the owner. If it is not, it starts recording user actions, which can later be reviewed by the owner. We conducted a laboratory study (n= 12) to examine users concerns over other people looking through their data, and to present the system to participants. We also conducted a field study (n= 10), where participants used the system for an extended period of time, in order to understand how they adopted it. Results indicate that the IDPS approach addresses previously unmet needs, namely by offering a security measure that does not require users to expend effort in every interaction with the device...|$|R

This type of ectopic bone formation is most prominent in skeletal muscle, most frequently resulting as a consequence of physical trauma and associated with aberrant tissue regeneration. The condition is debilitating, reducing a patient’s range of motion and potentially causing severe pathologies resulting from nerve and vascular compression. Despite efforts to understand the pathological processes governing HO, there remains a lack of consensus regarding the micro-environmental conditions conducive to its formation, and attempting to define the balance between muscle regeneration and pathological ossification remains complex. The development of HO is thought to be related to a complex interplay between factors released both locally and systemically in response to trauma. It develops as skeletal muscle undergoes significant repair and regeneration, and is likely to result from the misdirected differentiation of endogenous or systemically derived progenitors in response to biochemical and/or environmental cues. The process can be sequentially delineated by the presence of inflammation, tissue breakdown, adipogenesis, hypoxia, neo-vasculogenesis, chondrogenesis and ossification. However, exactly how each of these stages contributes to the formation of HO is at present not well understood. Our previous review examined the cellular contribution to HO. Therefore, the principal aim of this review will be to comprehensively outline changes in the local tissue micro-environment following trauma, and identify how these changes can alter the balance between skeletal muscle regeneration and ectopic ossification. An understanding of the mechanisms governing this condition is required for the development and advancement of HO prophylaxis and treatment, and may even hold the key to <b>unlocking</b> novel <b>methods</b> for engineering hard tissues...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{combines}} D. N.

40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF Thara G. Siddaramu, for the Master of Science {{degree in}} Civil and Environmental Engineering, {{presented}} on February 5, 2011, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: EVALUATION OF DIFFERENT PRETREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DISRUPTING LIGNOCELLULOSIC STRUCTURES MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Yanna Liang There {{are two major}} steps in biofuel production- pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials and enzymatic hydrolysis. The present study investigated the ability of two pretreatment methods, namely traditional oven and microwave oven treatments for disrupting lignocellulosic structures. The substrates tested were Jatropha seed cake and sweet sorghum bagasse. In recent years, Jatropha curcas also known as physic nut or purging nut has attracted extensive attention due to its several unique characteristics. Similarly, sweet sorghum {{has the potential to}} provide great value to energy sectors and food industries being that the entire plant is rich in various sugars and nutrients. Both crops can adapt to various climates, and can withstand extended drought conditions compared to other crops. Additionally, both Jatropha seed cakes and sweet sorghum bagasse are good sources of lignin and carbohydrates, which could be used for production of biofuels only if the sugars can be <b>unlocked.</b> Several treatment <b>methods</b> such as mechanical, physical, chemical and biological treatments have been reported to breakdown the cellulosic structure of biomass. However, other low cost and quicker methods, such as ovenpretreatment and microwave irradiation have not been evaluated for Jatropha seed cake and Sweet Sorghum Bagasse (SSB), respectively. Composition change of Jatropha seed cake samples was evaluated upon lime pretreatment at 100 oC with different parameters. With a lime dose of 0. 2 g and a water content of 10 ml per gram of cake and a treatment period of 1 h, 38. 2 ± 0. 6 % of lignin was removed. However, 65 ± 16 % of hemicellulose was also lost under this condition. For all the treatments tested, cellulose content was not affected by lime supplementation. Through further examining total reducing sugar (TRS) release by enzymatic hydrolysis after lime pretreatment, results indicated that 0. 1 g of lime and 9 ml of water per gram of cake and 3 h pretreatment produced the maximal 68. 9 % conversion of cellulose. Without lime pretreatment, the highest cellulose conversion was 33. 3 %. Finally, this study shows that Jatropha seed cake samples could be hydrolyzed by enzymes. Even though the cellulose content was not high for this Jatropha cake sample, the fractionation by lime presented in this study opened the door for other applications, such as removal of lignin and toxicity for use as animal feed and fertilizer. The microwave radiation pretreatment of SSB was evaluated with or without lime (0. 1 g/g bagasse) at 10 ml water/g bagasse for 4 min. TRS release over 72 -h enzymatic hydrolysis was different for samples treated differently and at different solid loadings. The TRS concentration was increased by 2 and 5 -fold from 0 to 24 hours in non lime-pretreated and lime-pretreated samples, respectively. Further incubation of samples for 48 and 72 h did not result in increased TRS. Comparing different solid loadings of samples treated with or without lime, 1 % solid content resulted in 1. 4 times higher TRS increase than that of 5 % solid concentration. Therefore, lime was effective in disintegrating lignocellulosic structures and making cellulose more accessible for saccharification. Higher solid loadings which can lead to higher sugar concentrations are desired for downstream biofuel production. But, as shown in this study, higher concentration of bagasse samples decreased rate of cellulose hydrolysis due to poorer mixing efficiency and hindrance to interactions between enzymes and solid materials. Thus, an optimal solid content needs to be determined for maximal cellulose hydrolysis and for preparing the hydrolysates for downstream processes, either bioethanol or lipid production...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{increasing}} {{attention has}} been paid to the importance of networks and networking culture especially from a sociological perspective that analyzes networks as a new societal model (van Dijk, 1991; Castells, 1996) and from a managerial and governance perspective (O’Flynn and Wanna, 2007; Camarinha-Matos et al., 2010). In the cultural fields, many studies have focused on networks established within the cultural sectors and among cultural institutions, both private and public (Scrofani and Ruggeto, 2012; Guintcheva and Passebois-Ducros, 2012). The importance of cultural networks has been underlined both within a territorial framework and within a trans-national framework; according to Littoz-Monet (2013), cultural networks could work as “vectors for integration” in Europe, and in particular since 2007 the European Commission has tried to encourage the cultural sector to work in a more trans-sectoral way, promoting the dialogue between cultural networks and stakeholders belonging to other fields. Some authors also hinted at the potential of networks as a means to successfully deal with the impact of the ongoing economic and financial crisis on the cultural sector (Bonet and Donato, 2011) : in order to overcome the decrease of public funding in the cultural field and the related threats to cultural institutions, new governance and management models based on networking culture should be created both at the “micro” and “meso” level, involving also partnerships between public and private subjects. As far as Italy is concerned, many cultural networks are already in place and are often sectorial (e. g. museum networks, library networks, etc…); in recent times, however, there is a growing trend towards opening those networks to collaborations with institutions and subjects belonging to other fields, such as local authorities, tourism entities and cultural and creative industries. The aim of this paper is to analyze the possibilities of implementation of networks where cultural organizations are involved but also where cooperation between actors belonging to different sectors is established. The analysis is carried out in a “meso” perspective, i. e. at the territorial level; indeed the paper questions the potential of networks based on culture as tools for the development of a territory in terms of creation of ecosystems based on culture and tries to understand the role played by cultural institutions (museums in particular) in trans-sectoral cooperation. This paper presents the results of a research that started in 2011 exploring the state-of-the-art of the cooperation in the High Adriatic Region. In 2013 - 2014 the research was limited to a more specific area, the Po Delta region: as the name suggests, this is the territory surrounding the Delta of the most important Italian river, River Po, at the border between two regions (Emilia Romagna and Veneto) and comprising three Italian provinces, Ferrara, Rovigo and Ravenna. This territory is considered as an area with a strong potential in terms of creation of networks based on culture; indeed, it is particularly rich in cultural, naturalistic and tourism attractions (e. g. Ravenna, Ferrara and its Po Delta have been included in UNESCO World Heritage Sites list) and many cultural and creative industries are located there. The nurturing of networks based on cooperation and collaborations between subjects and stakeholders belonging to different sectors seems essential not only to promote the development of this region but also to bring positive societal renewal and innovation. The research aimed at answering the following questions: •	How is the state of the art of the creation of trans-sectoral cooperation in the area of the Po Delta? How are these collaborations perceived by different stakeholders? •	How are these kinds of collaborations implemented? Are there structured networks in place in the region of the Po Delta? •	What is the potential of these networks for this territory? How could the potential of the trans-sectoral networks of this area be <b>unlocked?</b> The research <b>method</b> is based on an empirical survey, performed both by means of a questionnaire and by means of interviews with the most important stakeholders of this area, brought together in meetings and focus groups...|$|R
