5|$|We should infer in {{the case}} of a {{beautiful}} dwelling-place that it was built for its owners and not for mice; we ought, therefore, in the same way to regard the <b>universe</b> <b>as</b> the dwelling-place of the gods.|$|E
5|$|Astronomical {{models of}} the Universe were {{proposed}} soon after astronomy began with the Babylonian astronomers, who viewed the <b>Universe</b> <b>as</b> a flat disk floating in the ocean, and this forms the premise for early Greek maps like those of Anaximander and Hecataeus of Miletus.|$|E

5|$|It first {{aired on}} October 8, 2009 in the United States, and was watched {{by more than}} 6.02 million viewers. The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews, with many critics praising the new revelations about the shapeshifters, the parallel <b>universe,</b> <b>as</b> well as the much-anticipated conversation between Olivia and William Bell. In January 2013, IGN ranked it as the third best episode of the series.|$|E
5|$|The HDF galaxies {{contained}} a considerably {{larger proportion of}} disturbed and irregular galaxies than the local universe; galaxy collisions and mergers were {{more common in the}} young <b>universe</b> <b>as</b> it was much smaller than today. It is believed that giant elliptical galaxies form when spirals and irregular galaxies collide.|$|E
5|$|The Land of Gorch {{influenced}} later works {{within the}} Jim Henson <b>universe</b> <b>as</b> well, including {{the television show}} Dinosaurs produced by The Jim Henson Company. The first episode of Dinosaurs featured a plot line supporting environmentalism that was similar to an episode of The Land of Gorch. The Land of Gorch segment from the November 8, 1975 episode of Saturday Night Live hosted by Candice Bergen included themes that were reused in Dinosaurs.|$|E
50|$|MMORPGs {{usually have}} sharded <b>universes,</b> <b>as</b> {{they provide the}} most {{flexible}} solution to the server load problem, but not always. For example, the space simulation Eve Online uses only one large cluster server peaking at over 60,000 simultaneous players.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{commercial}} alternatives, it {{is designed}} for long games supporting <b>universes</b> <b>as</b> large as the player's computer can handle. It allows {{a high degree of}} player customization, and features a flexible technology system, where new technologies may be introduced mid-game.|$|R

5|$|The Stoic view of fate {{is entirely}} {{based on a}} view of the <b>universe</b> <b>as</b> a whole. Individual things and persons only come into {{consideration}} as dependent parts of this whole. Everything is, in every respect, determined by this relation, and is consequently subject to the general order of the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{age of the}} <b>universe</b> <b>as</b> {{estimated}} {{from the}} Hubble expansion and the CMB is now in good agreement with other estimates using {{the ages of the}} oldest stars, both as measured by applying the theory of stellar evolution to globular clusters and through radiometric dating of individual Population II stars.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} considerable {{praise for}} its technically challenging racing and fusion {{of popular culture}} elements. Many critics praised the unique blend of techno music and designer logos in one cohesive futuristic racing <b>universe</b> <b>as</b> {{the beginning of a}} new trend in gaming to tap into popular culture and other arts, which was made possible by the new storage space of the time.|$|E
50|$|A multiverse is the {{collection}} of alternate universes, with a similar nature and a universal hierarchy. The Marvel Multiverse contains the universe that holds Earth-616, most of the What If? <b>universes,</b> <b>as</b> well as the vast number of the alternate Marvel Universe Earths.|$|R

5|$|Feige {{stated in}} January 2013 that Ant-Man {{would be part}} of Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and {{indicated}} in May that the screenplay needed to be modified in order to fit into the <b>universe,</b> <b>as</b> the project had been in development before the first Iron Man film. Feige also stated that shooting was slated to begin sometime in 2014, and that casting would begin towards the end of 2013. In July 2013, Wright said that he and Cornish had completed the script for the film and that Marvel allowed him to delay its production so that he could complete The World's End, as that film's producer Eric Fellner was diagnosed with cancer.|$|E
5|$|Gamma ray bursts {{can have}} harmful or {{destructive}} effects on life. Considering the <b>universe</b> <b>as</b> a whole, the safest environments for life {{similar to that}} on Earth are the lowest density regions in the outskirts of large galaxies. Our knowledge of galaxy types and their distribution suggests that {{life as we know}} it can only exist in about 10% of all galaxies. Furthermore, galaxies with a redshift, z, higher than 0.5 are unsuitable for {{life as we know it}}, because of their higher rate of GRBs and their stellar compactness.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{there have}} been many ideas of the cosmos (cosmologies) and its origin (cosmogonies). Theories of an impersonal Universe governed by {{physical}} laws were first proposed by the Greeks and Indians. Ancient Chinese philosophy encompassed the notion of the Universe including both all of space and all of time. Over the centuries, improvements in astronomical observations and theories of motion and gravitation led to ever more accurate descriptions of the Universe. The modern era of cosmology began with Albert Einstein's 1915 general theory of relativity, which made it possible to quantitatively predict the origin, evolution, and conclusion of the <b>Universe</b> <b>as</b> a whole. Most modern, accepted theories of cosmology are based on general relativity and, more specifically, the predicted Big Bang.|$|E

50|$|In this reality, the Monitors {{had access}} to energy {{constructs}} that were able to record messages and transmit communiques across the Multiverse. They also forged orbs that glowed with light {{and served as a}} guide across the alternate <b>universes</b> <b>as</b> well as serve as a communicator with the Monitors. On their homeworld of Nil, there were spatial engines {{that could be used to}} help prevent large scale universal breaches that would damage the Multiverse.|$|R
5|$|In 1917, Einstein {{applied the}} {{general theory of}} {{relativity}} to the structure of the <b>universe</b> <b>as</b> a whole. He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the cosmological constant, to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of Mach's principle in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein's static universe.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts χ is a prequel to the Kingdom Hearts series as a whole, {{taking place}} more than 100 years prior. It takes {{place before the}} Keyblade War, which {{established}} {{the organization of the}} Kingdom Hearts <b>universe</b> <b>as</b> of the original game. The player assumes the role of a Keyblade wielder who joins one of five factions led by Keyblade Masters fighting for control of the limited light existing in the world. The game's plot is connected to Kingdom Hearts III, the next main entry in the series. The title refers to the legendary χ-blade, a weapon central to the series' story arc.|$|E
5|$|On {{the largest}} scale, the Universe is {{continually}} expanding, {{resulting in an}} average increase in the separation between individual galaxies (see Hubble's law). Associations of galaxies can overcome this expansion on a local scale through their mutual gravitational attraction. These associations formed early in the <b>Universe,</b> <b>as</b> clumps of dark matter pulled their respective galaxies together. Nearby groups later merged to form larger-scale clusters. This on-going merger process (as well as an influx of infalling gas) heats the inter-galactic gas within a cluster to very high temperatures, reaching 30–100 megakelvins. About 70–80% of the mass in a cluster {{is in the form}} of dark matter, with 10–30% consisting of this heated gas and the remaining few percent of the matter in the form of galaxies.|$|E
50|$|Similarly, Shadowrun {{presents}} a futuristic dystopia that draws heavily from Cyberpunk influences such as cyberized limbs, megacorporations and the virtual reality internet {{in the form}} of the Matrix, while also including, as a major plot element, the return of magic to the world and the classic Dungeons and Dragons races of elves, dwarfs, trolls and so forth. Likewise, the superhero genre typically emulates the comic book <b>universes</b> such <b>as</b> the DC and Marvel <b>Universes</b> <b>as</b> a form of science fantasy set in contemporary setting where all fantastic elements from futuristic technology to mythic beings co-exist.|$|R
50|$|This {{version of}} Death {{also made a}} cameo {{appearance}} in the crossover special Avengers/JLA #2. She is represented in the Grandmaster's home base, alongside Deadman, Hela and the purple-robed version of Death native to the Marvel <b>Universe,</b> which, <b>as</b> the plots of other crossover comics have hinged upon, exists in the same continuum of fictional <b>universes</b> <b>as</b> DC's. (Marvel's version of Death appears alternatively as a coldly beautiful woman in a purple robe or a walking skeleton (sometimes male and sometimes female in form, depending upon the context).|$|R
40|$|Operations such as {{integration}} or modularization of databases can {{be considered}} as operations on database universes. This paper describes some operations on database universes. Formally, a database universe is a special kind of table. It turns out that various operations on tables constitute interesting operations on database <b>universes</b> <b>as</b> well. ...|$|R
5|$|Production of {{the series}} was {{announced}} at the annual Comic-Con in San Diego on July 22, 2010. It was originally due for release in October 2011. Tentatively titled Avatar: Legend of Korra at the time, {{it was intended to}} be a twelve-episode mini series set in the same fictional <b>universe</b> <b>as</b> the original show, but seventy years later. In 2011, the title was changed to The Last Airbender: Legend of Korra, and again in March 2012 to The Legend of Korra. The premiere was eventually delayed to April 14, 2012. Animation work was mostly done by the South Korean animation studio Studio Mir.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolTe and atomic number52. It is a brittle, mildly toxic, rare, silver-white metalloid. Tellurium is chemically related to selenium and sulfur. It is occasionally found in native form as elemental crystals. Tellurium {{is far more}} common in the <b>universe</b> <b>as</b> a whole than on Earth. Its extreme rarity in the Earth's crust, comparable to that of platinum, is due partly to its high atomic number, but also to its formation of a volatile hydride which caused it to be lost to space as a gas during the hot nebular formation of the planet.|$|E
5|$|The {{invariant}} mass of {{an electron}} is approximately kilograms, or atomic mass units. On {{the basis of}} Einstein's principle of mass–energy equivalence, this mass corresponds to a rest energy of 0.511MeV. The ratio between the mass of a proton and that of an electron is about 1836. Astronomical measurements show that the proton-to-electron mass ratio has held the same value for {{at least half the}} age of the <b>universe,</b> <b>as</b> is predicted by the Standard Model.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} popular and {{well-known}} CMG to date is HeroClix, which allows players to create battles between characters from the Marvel and DC Comics comic book <b>universes,</b> <b>as</b> well as certain smaller publishers. Other popular CMGs include Dungeons & Dragons Miniatures Game, Halo Actionclix, Star Wars Miniatures, HorrorClix, and Monsterpocalypse.|$|R
