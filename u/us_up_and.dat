500|$|Contemporary Canadian art curator Diana Nemiroff {{suggested}} the controversy was {{largely due to}} the work being taken out of the larger context of the show. [...] "There's no doubt that the dress is a provocative object and it's meant to be a provocative object, but the cry that it's a waste of food is misplaced." [...] She noted that other exhibits have used grains, breads, and potatoes were used as part of previous exhibits, but the flesh was likely source of the controversy. Said Nemiroff: [...] "It's kind of double cross because clothing is supposed to be second skin and cover <b>us</b> <b>up.</b> <b>And</b> this one reverses the process and reveals what we don't want to confront: our mortality." ...|$|E

He moved the [...] "colored" [...] section sign behind Parks and demanded that four black people give up their seats in the middle section so that the white passengers could sit. Years later, in recalling the events of the day, Parks said, [...] "When that white driver stepped back toward us, when he waved his hand and ordered <b>us</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> out of our seats, I felt a determination to cover my body like a quilt on a winter night." ...|$|E

2500|$|Taking {{their name}} from the David Bowie song with the same title, Pritchard {{revealed}} the first song they ever played as a group was a cover version of The Strokes' song [...] "Reptilia". The Kooks recorded an EP demo, sending it out in search of gigs; they instead received offers from managers and record companies. The band had only been together as a group for four months when they signed with Virgin Records, after being spotted by several label scouts at the Brighton Free Butt Festival in 2005. In an interview with musicOMH, Pritchard revealed [...] "It was really quick how it all happened, we did a demo with a mate of ours in London, which we sent off to one guy to get some gigs, and {{he turned out to}} be a manager. He rung <b>us</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> it kind of went from there." [...] The members of the band have since revealed that they felt they weren’t ready at the time, [...] "We were way too early to sign a record deal ... We were really young, we'd been together like two or three months, so we really didn't want to sign. But then we thought it's a really good opportunity and Virgin seemed like really cool people - they just seemed to really understand where we were coming from.," [...] said Pritchard, who has also complimented the space the record label allowed for the band to grow, [...] "They were patient with us and let us develop our style, whatever it was." ...|$|E
