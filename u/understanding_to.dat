5|$|Like other {{volcanic}} {{zones in}} the Garibaldi Belt, volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field are not monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active their magma systems are. This {{is partly because}} the field {{is located in a}} remote region and no major eruptions have occurred in Canada in the last few hundred years. As a result, volcano monitoring is less important than dealing with other natural processes, including tsunamis, earthquakes and landslides. However, with the existence of earthquakes, further volcanism is expected and would probably have considerable effects, particularly in a region like southwestern British Columbia where the Garibaldi Belt is located in a highly populated area. Because of these concerns, significant support from Canadian university scientists have resulted in the construction of a baseline of knowledge {{on the state of the}} Garibaldi volcanoes. This improvement is continuous and will support the <b>understanding</b> <b>to</b> monitor volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field for future volcanism.|$|E
5|$|On April 29, 2010, MDOT {{announced}} plans to transfer M-108 in its entirety to the Village of Mackinaw City and Emmet County. In preparation for this transfer, MDOT repaved, widened and reconstructed the roadway. While rebuilding {{the section of the}} highway between US23 and the northern terminus, the welcome center was closed. Plans had this section to be completed, and the center to be reopened, for Memorial Day weekend, with the remainder of construction to be completed in August. Following the transfer to local control, M-108 ceased to be a state highway and the designation was decommissioned. Previous news reports stated that the roadway was too small to merit highway status under federal guidelines. The transfer was completed on December 9, 2010, when MDOT and local officials signed memoranda of <b>understanding</b> <b>to</b> finalize the transfer. The section within the Village of Mackinaw City was transferred to the village, and the remainder to Emmet County.|$|E
