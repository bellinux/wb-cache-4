5|$|In 1917, Einstein {{applied the}} {{general theory of}} {{relativity}} to the structure of the <b>universe</b> as a whole. He discovered that the general field equations predicted a <b>universe</b> that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic <b>universe</b> was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the cosmological constant, to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static <b>universe.</b> The modified field equations predicted a static <b>universe</b> of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of Mach's principle in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein's static <b>universe.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>Universe</b> is all {{of space}} and time (spacetime) and its contents, which {{includes}} planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space and all matter and energy. While the size of the entire <b>Universe</b> is still unknown, it is possible to measure the observable <b>universe.</b> Halpern and Tomasello calculated the observable <b>universe</b> using data from European Space Agency's Planck satellite, estimating it to be 90.68 billion light-years across, 0.7% smaller then previously thought.|$|E
5|$|The more matter {{there is}} in the <b>Universe,</b> the {{stronger}} the mutual gravitational pull of the matter. If the <b>Universe</b> were too dense then it would re-collapse into a gravitational singularity. However, if the <b>Universe</b> contained too little matter then the expansion would accelerate too rapidly for planets and planetary systems to form. Since the Big Bang, the <b>universe</b> has expanded monotonically. Perhaps unsurprisingly, our <b>universe</b> has just the right mass density of about 5 protons per cubic meter which has allowed it to expand for the last 13.8 billion years, giving time to form the <b>universe</b> as observed today.|$|E
50|$|Fecund <b>universes</b> is a multiverse {{theory of}} Lee Smolin {{about the role}} of black holes.

In Fecund <b>universes,</b> each new <b>universes,</b> according to Lee Smolin, has slightly different laws of physics. Because these laws are only slightly different, each is assumed to be like a mutation of the early <b>universes.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Universes</b> {{in films}} (or television) mostly {{consist of a}} {{franchise}} featuring an umbrella of multiple franchises (film or television) set within the same continuity, each franchise within telling its own stand-alone story focusing on a different character (or group of characters), as well as featuring its own cast, of directors, writers, while also {{being part of a}} coherent, non-contradictory continuity shared with the other works. Fictional <b>universes</b> with major presence in films are referred to as cinematic <b>universes,</b> while fictional <b>universes</b> with major presence in television are refereed to astelevision <b>universes.</b> <b>Universes</b> with major presence in films and television, generally are refereed as cinematic <b>universes</b> as that's the medium that reaches the most audiences. Some film and television <b>universes</b> are accompanied by video games, and print works such as novels or comics, telling additional canonical stories set within the same continuity.|$|R
5|$|The {{observable}} <b>Universe</b> is isotropic on scales significantly {{larger than}} superclusters, {{meaning that the}} statistical properties of the <b>Universe</b> are the same in all directions as observed from Earth. The <b>Universe</b> is bathed in highly isotropic microwave radiation that corresponds to a thermal equilibrium blackbody spectrum of roughly 2.72548 kelvin. The hypothesis that the large-scale <b>Universe</b> is homogeneous and isotropic {{is known as the}} cosmological principle. A <b>Universe</b> that is both homogeneous and isotropic looks the same from all vantage points and has no center.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{fate of the}} <b>Universe</b> {{is still}} unknown, because it depends critically on the curvature index k and the cosmological constant Λ. If the <b>Universe</b> were sufficiently dense, k would equal +1, meaning that its average curvature throughout is positive and the <b>Universe</b> will eventually recollapse in a Big Crunch, possibly starting a new <b>Universe</b> in a Big Bounce. Conversely, if the <b>Universe</b> were insufficiently dense, k would equal 0 or −1 and the <b>Universe</b> would expand forever, cooling off and eventually reaching the Big Freeze and the heat death of the <b>Universe.</b> Modern data suggests {{that the rate of}} expansion of the <b>Universe</b> is not decreasing, as originally expected, but increasing; if this continues indefinitely, the <b>Universe</b> may eventually reach a Big Rip. Observationally, the <b>Universe</b> appears to be flat (k = 0), with an overall density that is very close to the critical value between recollapse and eternal expansion.|$|E
5|$|A {{resolution}} to this apparent inconsistency {{is offered by}} inflationary theory in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the <b>universe</b> at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the <b>universe</b> undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently {{on opposite sides of}} the observable <b>universe</b> are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.|$|E
50|$|The book {{concludes with}} the {{statement}} that only some <b>universes</b> of the multiple <b>universes</b> (or multiverse) support life forms and that we are located in one of those <b>universes.</b> The laws of nature that are required for life forms to exist appear in some <b>universes</b> by pure chance, Hawking and Mlodinow explain (see Anthropic principle).|$|R

40|$|Recently {{some authors}} {{concluded}} that the energy and momentum of the Fiedman <b>universes,</b> flat and closed, are equal to zero locally and globally (flat <b>universes)</b> or only globally (closed <b>universes).</b> The similar conclusion was also done for more general only homogeneous <b>universes</b> (Kasner and Bianchi type I). Such conclusions originated from coordinate dependent calculations performed only in comoving Cartesian coordinates by using the so-called energy-momentum complexes. By using new coordinate independent expressions on energy and momentum one can show that the Friedman and more general <b>universes</b> needn’t be energetic nonentity. In the last years many authors have calculated the energy and momentum of the Friedman <b>universes</b> and also more general, only spatially homogeneous <b>universes,</b> like Kasner, Bianchi type I and Bianchi type II <b>universes.</b> 1 The above mentioned authors performed their calculations in special comoving coordinates called “Cartesian coordinates ” despite that they used coordinate dependent double index energy-momentum complexes, matter and gravitation.

5|$|According to the Big Bang theory, the <b>Universe</b> {{originated}} {{in an extremely}} hot and dense state about 13.8 billion years ago and began expanding rapidly. About 380,000 years later the <b>Universe</b> had cooled sufficiently to allow protons and electrons to combine and form hydrogen—the so-called recombination epoch. When this happened, matter and energy became decoupled, allowing photons to travel freely through space. The matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars, galaxies and other astronomical objects, leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms {{what is now called}} outer space. As light has a finite velocity, this theory also constrains the size of the directly observable <b>universe.</b> This leaves open the question as to whether the <b>Universe</b> is finite or infinite.|$|E

5|$|American {{astronomer}} Edwin Hubble {{observed that}} the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their redshifts. This was interpreted to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster they move away from us, regardless of direction. Assuming the Copernican principle (that the Earth is not {{the center of the}} <b>universe),</b> the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of the <b>universe</b> are receding from all others. Since we know that the distance between galaxies increases today, it must mean that in the past galaxies were closer together.
