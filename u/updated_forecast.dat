5|$|Multiple {{agencies}} predicted above-average activity, citing forecasts for slower-than-average trade winds, warmer-than-normal {{sea surface}} temperatures, abnormally low wind shear, and the unlikelihood of an El Niño developing {{prior to the}} peak of the season. On December5, 2012, Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), a public consortium consisting of experts on insurance, risk management, and seasonal climate forecasting at University College London, issued an extended-range forecast. In its report, the organization called for 15.4 (±4.3) named storms, 7.7 (±2.9) hurricanes, 3.4 (±1.6) major hurricanes, and a cumulative Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index of 134. While no value was placed on the number of expected landfalls during the season, TSR stated that the landfalling ACE index was expected to be above average. Four months later, on April5, Tropical Storm Risk issued its <b>updated</b> <b>forecast,</b> continuing to call for an above-average season with 15.2 (±4.1) named storms, 7.5 (±2.8) hurricanes, 3.4 (±1.6) major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 131; the landfalling ACE index was once again forecast to be higher than normal.|$|E

Also on June2, 2009, the Florida State University Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies (FSU COAPS) issued its first ever Atlantic hurricane season forecast. The FSU COAPS forecast predicted 8 named storms, including 4 hurricanes, and an ACE Index of 65. On June18, 2009, the UK Met Office (UKMO) issued a forecast of 6tropical storms in the July to November period with a 70% {{chance that the}} number {{would be in the}} range3 to 9. They also predicted an ACE Index of 60 with a 70%chance that the index would be in the range40 to 80.

5|$|On December7, 2011, Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), {{a public}} {{consortium}} consisting of experts on insurance, risk management, and seasonal climate forecasting at University College London, issued an extended-range forecast predicting an above-average hurricane season.

Later that month on December21, Weather Services International (WSI) issued an extended-range forecast predicting a near average hurricane season. In its forecast, WSI {{noted that a}} cooler North Atlantic Oscillation not seen in a decade, combined with weakening La Niña, {{would result in a}} near-average season with 12named storms, 7hurricanes, and 3major hurricanes. They also predicted a near-average probability of a hurricane landfall, with a slightly elevated chance on the Gulf Coast of the United States and a slightly reduced chance along the East Coast of the United States. On April 4, 2012, Colorado State University (CSU) issued their <b>updated</b> <b>forecast</b> for the season, calling for a below-normal season due to an increased chance for the development of an El Niño during the season.

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{dramatic}} increase {{over the past decade}} in the number of firms that source finished product from overseas. While this has reduced procurement costs, it has increased supply risk; procurement lead times are longer and are often unreliable.

To improve the accuracy of its demand forecast, a firm may <b>update</b> its <b>forecast</b> as the selling season approaches. In this paper we consider both <b>forecast</b> <b>updating</b> and lead time uncertainty. We characterize the firm’s optimal procurement policy, and we prove that, with multiplicative forecast revisions, the firm’s optimal procurement time is independent of the demand forecast evolution but that the optimal procurement quantity is not.

40|$|The {{decision}} {{to prepare for}} an oncoming hurricane is typically framed as a static cost:loss problem, based on a strike-probability forecast.

In this paper, the problem is reframed as a sequence of interrelated decisions that more accurately represents the situation faced by a decision maker monitoring an evolving tropical cyclone. A key feature of the decision model is that the decision maker explicitly anticipates and plans for future forecasts whose accuracy improves as lead time declines. A discrete Markov model of hurricane travel is derived from historical tropical cyclone tracks and combined with the dynamic decision model to estimate the additional value that can be extracted from existing <b>forecasts</b> by anticipating <b>updated</b> <b>forecasts,</b> rather than incurring an irreversible preparation cost based on the instantaneous strike probability. The value of anticipating forecasts depends on the specific alternatives and cost profile of each decision maker, but conceptual examples for targets at Norfolk, Virginia, and Galveston, Texas, yield expected savings ranging up to 8 % relative to repeated, static decisions.
