It was filmed at night, using the same sets as the Tod Browning production with a different cast and crew, a common practice in the early days of sound films.

40|$|The current Civil Code in force, {{unlike the}} {{previous}} one, succeeds into making {{a clear and}} natural distinction between will – as a whole – and legacy – as the main testamentary provision. Unfortunately, it does not also provide flawless regulations {{in terms of the}} categories of legacies, which are classified according to their object (<b>universal</b> <b>legacies,</b> <b>legacies</b> by <b>universal</b> title, <b>legacies</b> by particular title). In what the <b>legacy</b> by <b>universal</b> title is concerned, the Civil Code in force contains some controversial provisions at article 1056 paragraph (2) letter c), which interfere also with the correct qualification of legacy by particular title. Then, the regulations of the legal regime applicable to the legatee by particular title also evince flaws, for instance at article 1114 article (3) letter b) of the Civil Code, so that it becomes more and more difficult to qualify certain legacies, as being by particular or by universal title. The current work aims to point out the provisions of the Civil Code mentioned before, which generate or can generate potential controversies, but also to propose certain remedies...|$|R
50|$|Jonathan Maberry wrote a novelization to the film, the {{paperback}} {{of which was}} released on 2 February 2010, {{the same day the}} original The Wolf Man film was re-released on DVD through <b>Universal's</b> <b>Legacy</b> Series. It includes a scene early in the story which explains how Lawrence obtained the cane with a silver wolf's head (which features prominently in the original film and director's cut of the remake), with Lawrence exchanging his ordinary wooden cane with an elderly Frenchman for the silver wolf's head cane on his initial trip to Blackmoor. It also has Gwen and her father owning an apothecary rather than an antiques shop, suggesting this was changed during the remake's development to be closer to the original film.|$|R

40|$|There is {{a burgeoning}} {{literature}} about sports mega-events, {{such as the}} FIFA Men’s Football World Cup Finals (hereafter Football World Cup or World Cup) and the Olympic Games, {{and the notion of}} legacy. For the purposes of this chapter I will refer to two distinctions with respect to legacies — that they can be tangible and intangible, and also universal and selective. It is well established that legacies can be tangible, that is related to, for example, changes in some way to the material infrastructure or economic performance, and intangible, that is related to, for example, emotional responses to a mega-event whether individual or collective (Preuss, 2007). A second distinction I want to suggest when thinking about legacy is that legacies can be selective and universal. By this distinction I mean the following. Selective legacies are particular, individualist and elitist, and tend to serve the interests of those dominating powerful political and economic positions in society. <b>Universal</b> <b>legacies</b> are communal, collectivist and inherently democratic, available to all by virtue of being made freely accessible. A problem for sports mega-events is that they largely generate tangible legacies that are selective and intangible <b>legacies</b> that are <b>universal.</b> I will return to this distinction in the conclusion...|$|R

5000|$|Khane wrote {{several books}} about [...] "Egyptian yoga". He claimed in those books that some {{hatha-yoga}} asanas were practised in ancient Egypt. Khane claims in addition that other poses represented in Egyptian temples and graves had similar effects to the Indian one {{and could be}} considered as yoga postures. As Khane mentions himself, some [...] "Egyptian" [...] postures had been taught in the past by Hanish (Mazdanan, 1932), and A. de Sambucy, who wrote in the sixties the book Le Yoga irano-égyptien. Khane built a complete pedagogic system based on the Egyptian bas-reliefs and paintings, and studied the similarities between some Egyptian words or pharaonic symbols and Indian yogic concepts. He proposes to see in Pharao {{a model of the}} human realization. The assertion made by Khane in many of his books, lectures, interviews and articles is that signs of the existence of yoga appear at approximately the same time in India and Egypt, and that the two traditions are very close, but parallel. For Khane, yoga is a <b>universal</b> <b>legacy</b> kept in life and passed down to humanity through generations by India, {{despite the fact that it}} is possible to find numerous traces of yoga in Ancient Egypt and perhaps in a few Judaeo-Christian or Islamic practices. For him what is important in the fact that yoga was practiced in Egypt, is that it is a link between several spiritual traditions and a factor of unity for humanity.The idea that yoga was practised in Ancient Egypt is now accepted by several European writers specialized in the study of the spirituality. Khane is generally accepted by other yoga schools as one of the main exponents of Egyptian yoga. Davina Delor writes : [...] "Babacar Khane est le maître contemporain révélateur du Yoga des Pharaons." [...] Gérard Blitz, former General Secretary of the European Union of National Yoga Federations (UEFNY, called now European Union of Yoga) credits him with having found the traces of the Egyptian yoga [...] "Es este hombre que se interesa al Yoga Egipcio, Yoga de el que él su esposa han vuelto a encontrar huellas en una civilización antigua de al menos seis mil anos (ver su libro : [...] "El Yoga de los Faraones" [...] and asked him to conduct several international yogic trips (1987, 1989, 1991) to Egypt under the patronage of the European Union of National Yoga Federations.In Africa, Senghor in one of his official speeches, called upon Senegalese youth and athletes to return beyond Greece to their Egyptian roots, following the path opened by Khane.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores four {{events in}} which Joseph Ratzinger (now Pope Benedict XVI) attempts {{to address the}} modern and post-modern worlds. I demonstrate that his treatments {{of the relationship between}} reason and revelation, the Enlightenment's <b>legacy,</b> <b>universal</b> values, identity, and pluralism are engaged with a similar set of concepts addressed in the communitarian critique's initial reaction to the notion of the original position advanced in John Rawls's A Theory of Justice and the libertarian spirit of Robert Nozick's Anarchy, State, and Utopia. I posit that {{at the heart of this}} critique, as well as in Ratzinger's works analyzed here, is the concept of liberal entitlement as generated from Locke and other social contractors, and that bound up with this are a challenge against philosophic obsolescence and the absences of humility and obligation. It is through these three themes [...] humility, obligation, and obsolescence [...] that Ratzinger's political teaching and his own communitarian thought emerge in his writings. Particular attention is paid to the communitarian critique's discussion of the narrative method and the importance of identity, as they offer potential solutions for Ratzinger's desire for creating a non-coercive sense of civic obligation through a salient European identity and correcting the breakdown of common moral reference points in the West. This study ultimately explores where these select works by Ratzinger fit within this dialogue, and where they do not, as well as how they are situated within "garden variety" communitarianism of political theory and the Catholic Church's anti-liberal history. In doing so, Ratzinger's own communitarian thought takes shape...|$|R
