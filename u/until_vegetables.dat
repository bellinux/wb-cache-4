Gazing at them, I felt that by my agency something worth living for had been done. A new substance was born into the world. They were real and tangible existences, which the mind could seize hold of and rejoice in. A cabbage, too,--especially the early Dutch cabbage, which swells to a monstrous circumference, until its ambitious heart often bursts asunder,--is a matter to be proud of when we can claim a share with the earth and sky in producing it.

Bosanski lonac is prepared by layering meat and vegetables (alternating layers of meat and <b>vegetables</b> <b>until</b> the pot is full) into a deep pot, then adding 1 - 2 dl water.

In medieval times, the word temaemiso, meaning home-made miso, appeared. Miso production is a relatively simple process, so home-made versions spread throughout Japan. Miso was used as military provisions during the Sengoku era, and making miso was an important economic activity for daimyōs of that era.|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{presents a}} study about the viability and profability of a bio jet fuel production made of tobacco seeds oil. Firstly, an analisis {{about the state}} and role that bio jet fuel plays nowadays in the aeronautic industry is made, finding that although more than 2500 flights have been successfully operated using alternative fuels <b>until</b> 2016, <b>vegetable</b> oil based bio jet fuel productions represent an inexperienced study field, with great expectations and future ahead. Aeronautic organizations and airlines had commited with the main goal of neutralize green house growing emissions by 2020 and reduce by half of the levels reported in 2005 by 2050, bio jet fuels have become the main way of achieving that goal. Furthermore, economic fines will be charged to the companies that will not fulfill the emission level requirements. In 2011, Hydrotreated Esters of Fatty Acids HEFA technology is approved inside the ASTM D 7566 - 11 standard. The standard allows fabrication and comercialization of biojet fuels made of vegetable seed oils. Talking about viability, the biojet fuel production made of tobacco seed oil is viable at a local level. Spain, a country with small tobacco productions, {{has the power to}} produce about 2 million liters of biojet fuel, allowing to satisfy about 22 % of the anual fuel consumption used in the route Barcelona-Mallorca operated by a low cost airliner like Vueling, helping to reduce the green house emissions produced in that route. Finally, it is concluded that the individual process of fabricating biojet fuel with tobacco seed oil is not profitable selling at competitive prices, however; the global process taking into account co-products generated, it is profitable and competitive in the market...|$|R
2500|$|Since before 2000 BC, {{humans have}} {{utilized}} pesticides {{to protect their}} crops. The first known pesticide was elemental sulfur dusting used in ancient Sumer about 4,500 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia. The Rig Veda, which is about 4,000 years old, mentions the use of poisonous plants for pest control. By the 15th century, toxic chemicals such as arsenic, mercury, and lead were being applied to crops to kill pests. In the 17th century, nicotine sulfate was extracted from tobacco leaves for use as an insecticide. The 19th century saw the introduction of two more natural pesticides, pyrethrum, which is derived from chrysanthemums, and rotenone, which {{is derived from the}} roots of tropical <b>vegetables.</b> <b>Until</b> the 1950s, arsenic-based pesticides were dominant. [...] Paul Müller discovered that DDT was a very effective insecticide. Organochlorines such as DDT were dominant, but they were replaced in the U.S. by organophosphates and carbamates by 1975. Since then, pyrethrin compounds have become the dominant insecticide. Herbicides became common in the 1960s, led by [...] "triazine and other nitrogen-based compounds, carboxylic acids such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and glyphosate".|$|R

40|$|Background A {{family history}} of allergy, {{reflecting}} genetic risk factors, {{increases the risk of}} developing allergic diseases, but environmental factors, especially those present in early life, also contribute to the actual development of allergic phenomena. Objective To identify differences in lifestyle between allergic and non-allergic parents, which may influence the prevalence of environmental risk factors in their homes. Methods Data were collected in a Dutch birth cohort study by postal questionnaire about 2 months before and 3 months after the birth of the child. Results Of the 3147 infants in the study 1910 (61 %) had two non-allergic parents, of 315 infants (10 %) only the mother was allergic, of 787 infants (25 %) only the father was allergic and 135 (4 %) infants had two allergic parents. If both parents were allergic, 53 % reported that allergy was taken into consideration when they furnished their home and significantly more of their homes were free of cats and free of cigarette smoke; adjusted odds ratio's for two allergic parents vs. two non-allergic parents were 0. 30 (confidence interval (CI) 0. 17 - 0. 50) for the presence of cats and 0. 46 (CI 0. 27 - 0. 75) for smoking in the home. Parental allergy was also associated with having a smooth floor in the baby's bedroom and with postponement of the introduction of fruits and <b>vegetables</b> <b>until</b> the age of 26 weeks. The presence of dogs at home, the prevalence of mothers' smoking during pregnancy and the decision to breast feed were unrelated to parental allergy. Conclusion We conclude that studies on the relationship between allergy in parents and allergy in their offspring should always consider the home environment as a potential confounder. For allergy prevention our results imply that among allergic parents there is awareness and willingness to take measures that reduce exposure to indoor allergens...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: It is {{not known}} {{precisely}} the introduction of this species in our country, most research indicates XVI century but there are opinions that consider that this species is present in our country since the Dacian times. Until now has not been cultivated on a large area {{and it has not}} been obtained a distinct biological Romanian variety. It can be said that this species has been neglected <b>until</b> now as <b>vegetable</b> crop. This crop gives a high yield in tubers, it grows better in poor soils than most crops, and it is resistant to pests and common plant diseases as well as to cold temperatures (Kosaric, N., 1994). Selection for high yield, inulin content and other economically important traits are useful for improving this crop (Mullin, W. J., 1994). Unlike most crops that store carbon as starch, a polymer of glucose, in the Jerusalem artichoke carbon is stored as inulin, a fructose polymer (Kays, 2007). Aims: The research started in 1996, aimed to obtain  biological stabilized and genetically distinct varieties with reduced variability of the main characters, developing specific technology culture in accordance with DUS and rehabilitation of species through the promotion and expansion as vegetable crops in order to revaluate its many uses. Materials and Methods: It was evaluated the local genetic heritage in this species, representing valuable germplasm base composed of 24 genotypes. After purchasing the basic biological material, the evaluated genotypes were collected and 3 of them were detained as progeny. The breeding method used was the clonal selection. Results: The researches were completed with a valuable germplasm collection in this species, were obtained three varieties with distinct characteristics: L 1, which shows pink-brown tubers with a tubers yield of over 3. 8 kg / plant and a vegetative mass with a height of 2, 5 m, L 2, white tuber variety with an yield potential of 3. 4 kg / plant and a rich vegetative mass with a height of over 2. 8 m and L 3 that shows pink tubers with an average yield of 2. 4 kg / plant and an average plant height of 0. 8 m. Conclusion: The research ended with the evaluation of a valuable germplasm collection. Three stabilized genetically varieties with distinct phenotypic characteristics were obtained. Among them, L 1 was patented and the other two will be submitted in 2017. It was developed a specific technology for each variety and has been promotional offered improved material to growers with the aim of extending these varieties as vegetable crops.
