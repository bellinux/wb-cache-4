5|$|Bush {{played a}} {{critical}} role in persuading the United States government to undertake a crash program to create an atomic bomb. When the NDRC was formed, the Committee on Uranium was placed under it, reporting directly to Bush as the Uranium Committee. Bush reorganized the committee, strengthening its scientific component by adding Tuve, George B. Pegram, Jesse W. Beams, Ross Gunn and Harold Urey. When the OSRD was formed in June 1941, the Uranium Committee was again placed directly <b>under</b> <b>Bush.</b> For security reasons, its name was changed to the S-1 Section.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} the president's wishes, matters of policy were {{restricted}} to the president, Wallace, Bush, Conant, Secretary of War Henry Stimson and the Chief of Staff of the Army, General George C. Marshall. To implement this, the S-1 Section was placed outside NDRC, directly <b>under</b> <b>Bush,</b> who could authorize purchases. Harold D. Smith, {{the director of the}} Bureau of the Budget, gave Bush assurances that should OSRD resources prove insufficient, additional funding would be made available from monies controlled by the president.|$|E

25|$|Inflation <b>under</b> <b>Bush</b> has {{remained}} near historic lows at about 2-3% per year. The recession and {{a drop in}} some prices led to concern about deflation from mid-2001 to late 2003. More recently, high oil prices have caused concern about increasing inflation.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} presidencies of Vladimir Putin, who assumed the top office, first as acting {{president}}, {{on the last}} day of 1999, and United States president George W. Bush, the United States and Russia began to have serious disagreements. Under Putin, Russia became more assertive in international affairs; <b>under</b> <b>Bush,</b> the U.S. took an increasingly unilateral course in its foreign policy in the wake of the September 11 attacks.|$|E

25|$|The tax cuts, recession, and {{increases}} in outlays all contributed to record budget deficits during the Bush administration. The annual deficit reached record current-dollar levels of US$374 billion in 2003 and US$413 billion in 2004. National debt, the cumulative total of yearly deficits, rose from US$5.7 trillion (58% of GDP) to US$8.3 trillion (67% of GDP) <b>under</b> <b>Bush,</b> {{as compared to the}} US$2.7 trillion total debt owed when Ronald Reagan left office, which was 52% of the GDP.|$|E
25|$|Federal {{spending}} in constant dollars increased <b>under</b> <b>Bush</b> by 26% {{in his first}} {{four and a half}} years. Non-defense {{spending in}}creased 18% in that time. Of the US$2.4 trillion budgeted for 2005, about US$450 billion are planned to be spent on defense. This level is generally comparable to the defense spending during the cold war. Congress approved US$87 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan in November, and had approved an earlier US$79 billion package last spring. Most of those funds were for U.S. military operations in the two countries.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. {{national}} debt grew significantly from 2001 to 2009, both in dollar terms and {{relative to the}} size of the economy (GDP), due to a combination of tax cuts, wars and recessions. Measured for fiscal years 2001-2008, Federal spending under President Bush averaged 19.0% of GDP, just below his predecessor President Bill Clinton at 19.2% GDP, although tax receipts were substantially lower at 17.1% GDP versus 18.4% GDP. Income tax revenues averaged 7.7% GDP <b>under</b> <b>Bush,</b> versus 8.5% GDP under Clinton. The sizable {{national debt}} increases during his Administration represented a reversal from a sizable surplus projection by the Congressional Budget Office just prior to his taking office.|$|E

25|$|As Governor Bush's {{counsel in}} Texas, Gonzales also {{reviewed}} all clemency requests. A 2003 article in The Atlantic Monthly asserted that Gonzales gave insufficient counsel, {{and failed to}} second-guess convictions and failed appeals. Gonzales' deputy general counsel from 1995 to 1999, Pete Wassdorf, in turn sought to defend Gonzales from what he characterized as an inaccurate and incomplete picture of the clemency process <b>under</b> <b>Bush.</b> Under Section II, Article 4 of the Texas Constitution, the Governor cannot grant a pardon or commute a death sentence except with a majority vote recommendation of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, so Bush was constrained in granting clemency {{even if he had}} wanted to do so in a case. The fact remains that only one death sentence was overturned by Governor Bush, and the state of Texas executed more prisoners during Gonzales's term than any other state.|$|E
500|$|Clark {{has said}} that he began to truly define his {{politics}} only after his military retirement and the 2000 presidential election, won by George W. Bush. Clark had a conversation with Condoleezza Rice in which she told him that the war in Kosovo would not have occurred <b>under</b> <b>Bush.</b> Clark found such an admission unsettling, as he had been selected for the SACEUR position because he believed more in the interventionist policies of the Clinton administration. He said he would see it as a sign that things were [...] "starting to go wrong" [...] with American foreign policy <b>under</b> <b>Bush.</b> Clark supported the administration's War in Afghanistan in response to the September 11, 2001, attacks but did not support the Iraq War. Clark continued to warn people as a commentator on CNN that he believed the United States was undermanned in Iraq. He said the war was [...] "never ... WMD or regime change" [...] and believes [...] "the connection to the War on Terrorism was not shown." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jonathan Powell, {{who served}} {{as chief of staff}} to British Prime Minister Tony Blair {{at the same time as}} Rumsfeld's tenure <b>under</b> <b>Bush,</b> disparaged the memoir in The New Statesman.

Powell also asserted that Rumsfeld made [...] "no revelations of importance" [...] and wrote with a [...] "relentless desire always to be right" [...] that is [...] "deeply off-putting". Powell wrote (quoting Talleyrand) that Rumsfeld had [...] "learned nothing and forgotten nothing".|$|E

2500|$|While the Bush {{administration}} had put emphasis on killing significant members of al Qaeda {{the use of}} combat drones has undergone a quiet and unheralded shift during the Obama Administration to focus increasingly on killing Taliban foot soldiers according to CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen. Bergen noted: [...] "To {{the extent that the}} targets of drone attacks can be ascertained, <b>under</b> <b>Bush,</b> al Qaeda members accounted for 25% of all drone targets compared to 40% for Taliban targets. Under Obama, only 8% of targets were al Qaeda compared to just over 50% for Taliban targets." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nader often openly {{expressed}} his hope for Bush's victory over Gore, saying it [...] "would mobilize us", and that environmental and consumer regulatory agencies would fare better <b>under</b> <b>Bush</b> than Gore. [...] When asked {{which of the}} two he'd vote for if forced, Nader answered [...] "Bush… If you want the parties to diverge from one another, have Bush win." [...] As to whether he would feel regret if he caused Gore's defeat, Nader replied [...] "I would not — not at all. [...] I'd rather have a provocateur than an anesthetizer in the White House." [...] On another occasion, Nader answered this question with: [...] "No, not at all... There may be a cold shower for four years that would help the Democratic Party... It doesn't matter who is in the White House." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 2004, {{these cuts}} had reduced federal tax revenues, as a {{percentage}} of the Gross Domestic Product, to the lowest level since 1959. With the NASDAQ crash and one quarter of negative growth in 2000 it was likely we were headed into a recession, yet merely two years after the 2003 Bush tax cuts, federal revenues (in dollars) had reached a record high. [...] The effect of simultaneous record increases in spending and tax reductions was to create record budget deficits in absolute terms, though as recently as 1993, the deficit was slightly larger than the current 3.6% of the GDP. In the last year of the Clinton administration, the federal budget showed an annual surplus of more than US$230 billion. <b>Under</b> <b>Bush,</b> the government returned to deficit spending. The annual deficit reached an absolute record of US$374 billion in 2003 and then a further record of $413 billion in 2004.|$|E
