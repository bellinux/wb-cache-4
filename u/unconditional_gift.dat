5000|$|In {{the book}} of Psalms in the Bible, there are many {{passages}} of God referring to David as his son. There is a formulaic expression of adoption in the scriptures of God drawing in those that are saved as his sons and daughters. Scripture says [...] "I will be his father and he shall be my son," [...] (2 Samuel 7:14, 1 Chronicles 17:13) which directly correlates to a judicial gifting of eternal life and dwelling with the God most High. So the very understanding of sonship in the scriptures is the very basis for evidence of why kings like David, received this <b>unconditional</b> <b>gift</b> of eternal life. There is a grace that will be bestowed upon his children {{even in the midst}} of their sins.|$|E
50|$|Tradition {{generally}} {{holds that}} if the betrothal fails because the man himself breaks off the engagement, the woman is not obliged to return the ring. This reflects the ring's role {{as a form of}} compensation for the woman's damaged reputation. Legally, this condition can be subject to either a modified or a strict fault rule. Under the former, the fiancé can demand the return of the ring unless he breaks the engagement. Under the latter, the fiancé is entitled to the return unless his actions caused the breakup of the relationship, the same as the traditional approach. However, a no-fault rule is being advanced in some jurisdictions, under which the fiancé is always entitled to the return of the ring. The ring only becomes the property of the woman when marriage occurs. An <b>unconditional</b> <b>gift</b> approach is another possibility, wherein the ring is always treated as a gift, to be kept by the fiancée whether or not the relationship progresses to marriage. Recent court rulings have determined that the date in which the ring was offered can determine the condition of the gift. E.g. Valentine's Day and Christmas are widely recognized as gift giving holidays in the United States and some other countries. A ring offered {{in the form of a}} Christmas present is likely to remain the personal property of the recipient in the event of a breakup.|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{consider}} how gift-exchange and bonus systems {{function in a}} natural field setting by measuring the effort response of participants to non-monetary gifts over time. Our field experiment tests the difference in effort response to unconditional gifts delivered immediately, promised unconditional gifts delivered later, and conditional gifts linked to reaching a specific performance target. We find important benefits from promising to give an <b>unconditional</b> <b>gift</b> later: participants respond positively to a promised gift twice by increasing effort when the gift is promised and again when it is received. A promised gift outperforms both the <b>unconditional</b> <b>gift</b> delivered immediately, {{which leads to a}} single positive response, and the conditional gift based on performance, which does not trigger any significant behavioural change after the gift is delivered.

40|$|The highest {{courts in}} both Canada and South Africa have {{expressed}} themselves {{in favour of}} an approach of deference as respect in the review of administrative action. The notion of deference as respect derives from the thinking of David Dyzenhaus, who has developed a theory of democracy {{in support of this}} approach to judicial review. Dyzenhaus’ model of review attempts to steer clear from the problems he associates particularly with positivism and liberalism. Dyzenhaus’ model of review furthermore attempts to allow space for the administration to {{play a significant role in}} giving effect to democratic values, on the understanding that all such decisions need to be reasonably justifiable. In this article the views of Dyzenhaus are contrasted with those of Jacques Derrida, especially insofar as the latter has reflected on the relation between law and justice, as well as concepts such as the gift and democracy. The argument developed in this article is that Dyzenhaus’ model of review, despite its many positive features, needs to be rethought with reference to the perfect <b>gift,</b> <b>unconditional</b> justice and democracy to come. Such a rethinking is required because of the limited conception of justice – as simply ‘our’ justice – in Dyzenhaus’ model...|$|R

He returns from an overnight visit {{to find that the}} white rose bush has been hacked at its bole. At its base lies young Eluric, dead with a knife by his side. While investigating the murder scene with the Abbot and Brother Anselm, Brother Cadfael finds a distinctive footprint and makes a wax impression. Judith arrives to pick up the repaired girdle; Cadfael tells Judith about Eluric's desire for her. That night, Judith tells her servant Branwen that in the morning she will make the <b>gift</b> <b>unconditional,</b> which news Branwen shares in the kitchen. The next day, Judith fails to arrive at the abbey. The Sheriff, called back to town, Cadfael, and Abbot Radulfus believe that Judith was kidnapped, either to be forced into marriage or to void the charter by her absence on rent day. The search begins. Cadfael finds the once firmly-attached bronze tag from the end of Judith's girdle, suggesting a struggle. It is found under the bridge where a boat had been hauled up for convenient use, stolen by the kidnapper. Cadfael searches the River Severn with Madog, finding the stolen boat discarded downstream.|$|R
40|$|Research Questions: How might an object-event (object-life) {{perform a}} vivifying ethos for {{participants}} {{in relation to}} conditions of death as everyday? As a spatial design ethics how might this research deepen our perceptions of death-related everyday experiences whereby an unconditional mode of living expresses something fundamental to being human? This Spatial Design Masters project works toward an ethos of death as life-giving that is takes from social and cultural differences of death rites. It then moves toward a far more primordial unconditional experience of life-death continuum to explore how spatial design relational installation practices can produce affective learning experiences that operate within existential living. The practice seeks to learn from cultural differences {{but in order to}} work into the concept of Jacques Derrida’s unconditional as the gift of death — it works simply at a base human level (that is more than fathomable). Whether we can know the certainty of being mortal is not the question here —rather this work is underpinned by philosophical and design questions around existence to reveal that we are nothing but uncertain and mysterious creatures. The philosophical work is largely framed by Jacques Derrida’s concept of ‘the gift’ with particular relation to his writing on the gift of death. It takes also from Marcel Mauss’ work on the gift as that operating within an exchange or return cultural framework. The two interrelating positions are composed within my spatial design research as a way of moving from specific cultural, social and political life (as exchange conditions) toward an ethos of death as an <b>unconditional</b> <b>gift</b> for bringing us closer to more profound ways for considering our existence. It is a philosophical enquiry into how conditions of death and values of contemporary capitalist modes of living symptomatically produce a problematic ethical experience with respect to how death is treated as something to be harshly separated from living. This project attempts what it calls an ethics or ethos toward death in its attempt to express death as another form of living. It also takes inspiration from everyday artistic modes and expressions of novels and films that provide me with cues or narratives that exist out there influencing and reflecting our popular perceptions for {{what it means to be}} human. These different narratives provide me with insights into how there is an advanced repression in our encounters with death in our current and increasingly globalised cultural life worlds. My own material responses for this Masters comes through a process of locating everyday discarded architectural infrastructural objects, which in their abandoned and ruined state produce great potential for new life through my own encounter and collection of them; in bringing them ‘back’ into our everyday perception they offer points of revivification that correspond object and human relations. In this process of resuscitating the object-becomes-event (object-life) as a trace marking of still life, living on. In this sense, my practice is one of response and responsibility to a special kind of listening to the mysterious lives of others (human and non). In making strange, uncanny or ‘new’ the association with these found-objects, my practice narratives multiple possible readings of living on. Each new reading gives life to the way these objects may have been located in history, but also how they live-on through a new kind of living archive, which my practice installs. Ultimately, they are both allegorical and literal objects that event relations of life and death. The ‘final’ presentation or installation aims to show a kind of paradox in the works; a paradox that insists on two directions of death; its clinical and repressed condition (as marked by an overt install of a fourth wall) that then also deconstructs to invite another encounter of death as an existential teacher on how we live relationally with other beings that perform our vital expression. This paradox opens up the possibility of the unconditional and is provided its strategic approach through deconstruction as an initiator of moving outside neat binary attitudes of either/or — here the deconstruction of the ‘back-slash’ simplicity of life/death marks instead the spatial everyday continuum of life and death eventing, breaking free from the mastery of subject/object relations...|$|E
