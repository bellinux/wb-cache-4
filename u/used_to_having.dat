5|$|While still {{embroiled in}} his {{conflict}} with Longchamp, Geoffrey began feuding with Hugh du Puiset, probably over Geoffrey's authority in Puiset's diocese of Durham, {{one of those}} subject to York. The dispute dragged on for years, with many appeals to Rome and the king. York had been vacant for several years, and Puiset had grown <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> untrammelled authority in the northern archdiocese. After Geoffrey's consecration, he summoned Puiset to a provincial synod in late September 1191, at which the bishop was charged with various irregularities. Puiset appealed to Rome and refused to attend the synod, and was excommunicated in December by Geoffrey. An attempt in March 1192 by Queen Eleanor and Hubert Walter to settle the issue came to nothing when Geoffrey insisted on a pledge of obedience from Puiset, who in turn demanded an admission from Geoffrey that the excommunication had been unjust. Further appeals to Rome led to an eventual settlement in October 1192, when the bishop finally acknowledged Geoffrey's authority over Durham.|$|E
5|$|During Persson's time as {{chairman}} Malmö FF employed their first foreign managers and won their first national titles. In total Persson employed 15 managers, seven {{of whom were}} foreign born. Malmö FF won Allsvenskan and became Swedish champions {{for the first time}} in 1944, and by the end of the 1970s had won nine Swedish league championships. Most of the titles won during this time were under foreign managers, the most successful of whom in terms of honours was Bob Houghton, whom Persson appointed in 1974. Persson was reportedly initially hesitant to employ Houghton, who at 27 was younger than several of the club's players, but was convinced when the Englishman met them and won their respect and confidence. Houghton had never met any of the players, but had researched them thoroughly; he impressed the team by immediately recognising each of them and knowing them by first name. There was also some initial disagreement between Persson and Houghton as Persson had been <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> a final say in the team selection. Houghton wanted full purview over team selection, and Persson ultimately relented and gave it to him.|$|E
25|$|Interventionalists {{require a}} {{floating}} tabletop to allow fast and precise movements during angiography. Cardiac and vascular surgeons, in general, have less complex positioning needs, {{but based on}} their interventional experience in angiography may be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> fully motorized movements {{of the table and}} the tabletop. For positioning patients on non breakable tabletops, positioning aids are available, i.e. inflatable cushions. Truly floating tabletops are not available with conventional OR tables. As a compromise, floatable angiography tables specifically made for surgery with vertical and lateral tilt are recommended. To further accommodate typical surgical needs, side rails for mounting surgical equipment like retractors or limb holders should be available for the table.|$|E

Moore noted that Portnoy [...] "wasn't <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> other people have strong ideas about what the drum parts should be". For Free, Portnoy contributed drum tracks as a session musician, agreeing to [...] "take [...] ideas and do the best he could with playing", according to Moore. Portnoy's drum parts were recorded at Carriage House Studios in Stamford, Connecticut from November 18 to November 20, 2005.|$|E
500|$|In {{what some}} reporters {{described}} as a continuity error, Charles Miner refers to Jim's second-in-command position as [...] "made up", but the position is real and Jim was officially hired {{for it in the}} third season episode [...] "Branch Closing". When asked by a fan about the apparent inconsistency, The Office writer Aaron Shure said he believed it was because [...] "Charles is clearly not great at reading people and he's headstrong", and the fact that Jim does not normally care about titles, so he was not <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> to defend himself in such a way. However, Shure admitted he was [...] " [...] to wiggle out of this one" [...] with his answer.|$|E
500|$|Art Modell, a New York {{advertising}} executive, {{bought the}} team in 1961 for almost $4 million ($ today). Modell, who was 35 {{years old at the}} time, bought out Brown's 15% stake in the team for $500,000 and gave Brown a new eight-year contract. He said he and Brown would have a [...] "working partnership", and began to play a more direct role than previous owners in the team's operation. [...] This angered Brown, who was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> a free hand in football matters. Modell, who was single and only {{a few years older than}} most players, started to listen to their concerns about the coach. He became particularly close to Jim Brown, calling him [...] "my senior partner". Modell sat in the press box during games and could be overheard second-guessing Paul Brown's play-calling, which drove a deeper wedge between the two men. At that time, Brown was the only coach who insisted on calling every offensive play. When Plum openly questioned Paul Brown's absolute control over play-calling, he was traded to Detroit.|$|E

500|$|Patterson asked Groves {{to create}} a new agency to take over {{responsibility}} for the aspects of nuclear weapons that still remained under the military. It was to be jointly staffed by the Army and Navy, and on 29 January 1947, Patterson and Forrestal issued a memorandum that formally established the AFSWP. Its chief would be [...] appointed jointly by the Chief of Staff of the Army and the Chief of Naval Operations, along with a deputy from the opposite service. Both would be members of the Military Liaison Committee, because the Atomic Energy Act stipulated that the Military Liaison Committee was the sole military body that dealt with the AEC. In February 1947, Eisenhower and Chief of Naval Operations Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz appointed Groves as head of the AFSWP, with Parsons as his deputy. Accordingly, Groves was appointed to the Military Liaison Committee, although the newly appointed AEC chairman, David E. Lilienthal, told Patterson that he did not think {{that it was a good}} idea, because Groves had run the Manhattan Project by himself for four years, and was not <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> to compromise.|$|E
500|$|Disney {{had been}} {{interested}} in producing abstract animation since he saw A Color Box by Len Lye from 1935. He explained the work done in the Toccata and Fugue was [...] "no sudden idea... they were something we had nursed along several years but we {{never had a chance}} to try". Preliminary designs included those from effects animator Cy Young, who produced drawings influenced by the patterns on the edge of a piece of sound film. In late 1938 Disney hired Oskar Fischinger, a German artist who had produced numerous abstract animated films, including some with classical music, to work with Young. Upon review of three leica reels produced by the two, Disney rejected all three. According to Huemer all Fishinger [...] "did was little triangles and designs... it didn't come off at all. Too dinky, Walt said." [...] Fischinger, like Disney, was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> full control over his work and was not used to working in a group. Feeling his designs were too abstract for a mass audience, Fishinger left the studio in apparent despair, before the segment was completed, in October 1939. Disney had plans to make the Toccata and Fugue an experimental three-dimensional film, with audiences being given cardboard stereoscopic frames with their souvenir programs, but this idea was abandoned.|$|E
500|$|Sinclair {{himself said}} in 2005 that the C5 [...] "was early {{for what it}} was. People reacted {{negatively}} and the press didn't help. It was too low down and people felt insecure, hence it got bad press." [...] Sam Dawson of Classic and Sport Car Magazine described the C5 as [...] "incredibly fun to drive", suggesting that the safety concerns [...] "could have been addressed if it wasn't {{for the fact that}} it was already doomed as a national joke." [...] He noted the disconnect between the media's expectations of a serious electric car and the reality of the C5, which he called [...] "just a fun way of getting around". Professor Stuart Cole of the University of South Wales comments that the C5 suffered from the design of the roads and the attitudes of the time, which were not geared towards pedal or electric vehicles: [...] "In the days before unleaded petrol, your face would have been at the height of every exhaust pipe, and drivers weren't <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> to consider slower-moving cyclists. But with more cycle lanes, better education, and workplaces providing showers, etc., the world now is much more geared up for people looking for alternatives to the car, and hopefully will become even more so in the future." ...|$|E

500|$|Leterrier {{had planned}} to use {{prosthetic}} makeup and animatronics to complement the computer-generated imagery that was solely used in the previous film. The make-up artists who worked on [...] were set to portray Blonsky's gradual transformation, which Zak Penn said would portray Blonsky [...] "not [...] <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> these properties. Like he's much heavier, {{and we talked about}} how when he walks down the sidewalk, his weight destroys the sidewalk and he's tripping. [...] the humanization of these kinds of superhero characters, showing the effects physics may actually have on [...]" [...] Tom Woodruff, Jr. of Amalgamated Dynamics (who created all the costumes for the Alien films since Alien 3) was in negotiations, and created two busts of the Hulk and prosthetic hands to act as stand-ins for the character. A full animatronic was never created as it was decided it would complicate production to set up shots for a puppet and then a computer graphic. An animatronic was used for Sterns' mutating head, however. Destruction was mostly done practically. A model of a bottling machine was smashed through a wall for when the Hulk escapes the factory. The filmmakers used steam and dry ice for the gas used to smoke out the Hulk, and they destroyed a real Humvee by dropping a weight on it when shooting the Culver University battle. Pipes blew fire for when the Hulk strikes down the computer-generated helicopter. When Banner falls from the helicopter to trigger the Hulk into fighting the Abomination, Norton was attached to a surface held by a bar which turned 90 degrees while the camera was pulled to the ceiling to simulate falling. Leterrier jokingly remarked that making Norton fall that distance would obviously render him unable to act.|$|E
2500|$|By September 8, 1850, the Fosters had {{returned}} to Allegheny City (now part of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) and moved in with Stephen's older brother, William Barclay Foster, Jr. Jane's mother-in-law, father-in-law and brother-in-law, were also living in the home. [...] Jane became pregnant and gave birth to their only child, Marion, born April 18, 1851. [...] After the birth of Marion, they moved in with Jane's family for some months {{and then returned to}} the Foster home. This time in Jean's life has been identified as being quite difficult for her since she was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> servants, a larger home and privacy.|$|E

2500|$|The United States was not {{a member}} of the BIE at the time, but fair {{organizers}} understood that a sanction by the BIE would assure that its nearly 40 member nations would participate in the fair. Moses, undaunted by the rules, journeyed to Paris to seek official approval for the New York fair. When the BIE balked at New York's bid, Moses, <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> his way in New York, angered the BIE delegates by taking his case to the press, publicly stating his disdain for the BIE and its rules. [...] The BIE retaliated by formally requesting its member nations not to participate in the New York fair. [...] The 1939/1940 and 1964/1965 New York World's Fairs were the only significant world's fairs since the formation of the BIE to be held without its endorsement.|$|E
2500|$|Wingate {{was known}} for various eccentricities. For instance, he often wore an alarm clock around his wrist, which would go off at times, and had raw onions and garlic on a string around his neck, which he would {{occasionally}} bite into as a snack (the reason he used to give for this was to ward off mosquitoes). He often went about without clothing. In Palestine, recruits were <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> him {{come out of the}} shower to give them orders, wearing nothing but a shower cap, and continuing to scrub himself with a shower brush. Lord Moran, Winston Churchill's personal physician, wrote in his diaries that [...] " [...] seemed to me hardly sane—in medical jargon a borderline case". Likewise, referring to Churchill's meeting with Wingate in Quebec, Max Hastings wrote that, [...] "Wingate proved a short-lived protegé: closer acquaintance caused Churchill to realise that he was too mad for high command".|$|E
2500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} August 13, 1970 in Los Angeles and lasted {{for eight weeks}} with a crew of 30, three matching Chevrolets and two matching G.T.O.s traveling through the southwest towards Memphis, Tennessee. Hellman insisted on going across country, like {{the characters in the}} film, because he felt {{it was the only way}} to convince the audience that the characters raced across the United States. He said, [...] "I knew it would affect the actors— and it did, obviously. It affected everybody". Hellman took an unconventional approach of not letting his three lead, inexperienced actors read the script. Instead, he gave them pages of dialogue on the day of shooting. The actors felt uncomfortable with this approach. In particular, James Taylor, <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> control when it came to his music, was upset at being unable to read the script in advance. Hellman eventually gave him permission to do so, but Taylor never did read it.|$|E

2500|$|A {{regular on}} British radio and television, {{he has been}} {{described}} as [...] "a formidable interview subject, with a hostility simmering just beneath the surface – perhaps because, in his words, he is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> to 'hit hard' whenever he is given the chance to air his unfashionable views." [...] In 2011, Hitchens was booed by the audience for a Question Time programme, on which he appears regularly, when he said that the expansion of sex education had been followed by increased numbers of teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. During the same programme, chairman David Dimbleby quoted to Hitchens comments made by John Bercow that The Mail on Sunday was [...] "a bigoted, sexist, homophobic comic strip." [...] After his appearance, Hitchens wrote [...] "Is there any point in public debate in a society where hardly anyone has been taught how to think, while millions have been taught what to think?" [...] Hitchens is also heard on Any Questions?, This Week, The Daily Politics and The Big Questions.|$|E
2500|$|As one of {{the first}} music {{producer}} auteurs, he (along with George Martin) popularized the idea of the recording studio as a compositional tool. Only 21-years-old when he received the freedom to produce his own records with total creative autonomy, Wilson ignited an explosion of like-minded California producers, supplanting New York as the center of popular records, and becoming the first rock producer to use the studio as a discrete instrument. The Beach Boys were thus {{one of the}} first rock groups to exert studio control. Brother Carl Wilson explained the significance of Brian's control over the group's productions: [...] "Record companies were <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> absolute control over their artists. It was especially nervy, because Brian was a 21-year-old kid with just two albums. It was unheard of. But what could they say? Brian made good records." [...] Music producers after the mid 1960s would draw on Wilson's influence, setting a precedent that allowed bands and artists to enter a recording studio and act as producers, either autonomously, or in conjunction with other like minds. In the late 1960s, Wilson also started a trend of [...] "project" [...] recording, where an artist records by himself instead of going into an established studio.|$|E
2500|$|Problems with {{dentures}} {{may arise}} because patients are not <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> {{something in their}} mouth that is not food. The brain senses the appliance and interprets it as 'food', sending messages to the salivary glands to produce more saliva and to secrete it at a higher rate. This usually only happens in the first 12 to 24 hours, after which the salivary glands return to their normal output. [...] New dentures can also {{be the cause of}} sore spots as they compress the denture-bearing soft tissues (mucosa). [...] A few denture adjustments in the days following insertion of the dentures can take care of this problem. [...] is another problem encountered by a minority of patients. [...] At times, {{this may be due to}} a denture that is too loose, too thick or extended too far posteriorly onto the soft palate. [...] At times, gagging may also be attributed to psychological denial of the denture. Psychological gagging is the most difficult to treat since it is out of the dentist's control. [...] In such cases, an implant-supported palateless denture may have to be constructed. Sometimes there could be a gingivitis infection under the completed dentures, caused by the accumulation of dental plaque. One of the most common problems for wearers of new upper complete denture is a loss of taste sensations.|$|E
