40|$|The {{production}} of walnut nursery plants {{is a complex}} process, being dependent upon a range of factors that affect graft-take success and behaviour of walnut plants in the nursery. The experiment included two parts. Three different treatments {{were used in the}} heated room under controlled air temperature and humidity conditions: Treatment 1 -grafting without paraffin treatment of the scion and graft <b>union,</b> <b>coupled</b> with covering the graft with sawdust {{up to the top of}} the scion; Treatment 2 -grafting involving paraffin treatment of the scion and graft <b>union,</b> <b>coupled</b> with covering the graft with sawdust up to the top of the scion; and Treatment 3 -grafting involving paraffin treatment of the scion and graft <b>union,</b> <b>coupled</b> with covering the graft with both sawdust up to the top of the scion and polyethylene foil. The treatments were evaluated for their effect on graft-take success. Graft planting in the nursery was followed by two treatments: treatment without foliar fertilisation and treatment with foliar fertilisation. Under controlled conditions, treatment 3 induced a higher graft-take success as compared to the other two treatments, whereas foliar fertilisation in the nursery had a positive effect on the survival, {{production of}} class 1 plants and vegetative growth of walnut plants...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} a 3 -year {{follow-up}} of 65 male and 138 female same-sex couples who had civil unions in Vermont during the 1 st year of that legislation. These couples were compared with 23 male and 61 female same-sex couples in their friendship circles {{who did not have}} civil unions and with 55 heterosexual married couples (1 member of each was a sibling to a member of a civil <b>union</b> <b>couple).</b> Despite the legalized nature of their relationships, civil <b>union</b> <b>couples</b> did not differ on any measure from same-sex couples who were not in civil <b>unions.</b> However, same-sex <b>couples</b> not in civil unions {{were more likely to have}} ended their relationships than same-sex civil union or heterosexual married couples. Compared with heterosexual married participants, both types of same-sex couples reported greater relationship quality, compatibility, and intimacy and lower levels of conflict. Longitudinal predictors of relationship quality at Time 2 included less conflict, greater level of outness, and a shorter relationship length for men in same-sex relationships and included less conflict and more frequent sex for women in same-sex relationships at Time 1...|$|R

50|$|Following the Governor's {{signature}} of the 2013 law that legalized same-sex marriage in Illinois, civil unions remain in effect and operative for both opposite-sex and same-sex couples. Couples who want to convert their civil union to a marriage can do so, with or without performing a new ceremony, for up to one year from the date that the marriage law takes effect (June 1, 2014).

40|$|Changes to the Australian {{regulatory}} landscape {{over the}} past three decades of global liberalisation created regulatory uncertainty for <b>unions.</b> <b>Coupled</b> with membership decline and internal restructuring through union amalgamations, they prompted an important reorientation by unions (back) to the workplace, and precipitated different strategic decisions and organising challenges. However, the proliferation of fragmented employment relationships rendered workplace-centred organising an insufficient response. As a result, some unions experimented with ways of supplementing existing legal frameworks by other regulatory initiatives, through campaigns that resulted in the layering of regulation. In this article, we examine attempts by three unions - covering garment workers, road transport workers and aged care workers - to address the needs of members in garment homeworking, road transport and aged care in a contested regulatory environment...|$|R
