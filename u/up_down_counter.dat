40|$|Counters are {{the basic}} {{building}} block in embedded system design. Counters are used for counting purpose. Similarly it is used for frequency division. Counters are the Sequential Circuits in which the output depends upon the previous as well as present input. Basically counters are classified in two categories one is Asynchronous Counter and another is Synchronous Counter. The operation of the counter is depending upon the clock which is a timing signal. Clock is required to change {{the state of the}} counter i. e. triggering. For high speed (fast response) clock is taken as negative edge triggered. Counters are designed using flip flops that {{are the basic}} storage elements in digital design. A sequential circuit is the combination of Combinational circuit and Memory. The present input is stored in combinational circuit and the previous input is stored in memory. There are various types of counters such as Ripple Counter, Up Counter, Down Counter, Johnson Counter and Synchronous Counter. Here we present the design of 64 bit <b>up</b> <b>down</b> <b>counter</b> & implementation is done on FPGA...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper has}} {{emphasis}} on the novel sequence generation for the hardwired built in self test (BIST) of {{static random access memory}} (SRAM). It reduces the testing time of SRAM by generating all the pattern sequence in less time. BIST is a design technique that allows a circuit to test itself. Linear feedback shift register (LFSR) was used for the sequence generation in the BIST but novel sequence generator is better than LFSR for BIST of SRAM. The novel designing of the sequence generator has done with the help of synchronous <b>up</b> and <b>down</b> <b>counter.</b> The <b>up</b> and <b>down</b> <b>counter</b> has used here is of 4 bits and the corresponding addresses are also of 4 bits but there is a unique transition take place. The switching between the sequence of the <b>up</b> and <b>down</b> <b>counter</b> generates the sequence which is fulfilling the requirement for the BIST purpose. This requires very little hardware overhead so the area is reduced which on the other hand reduced cost as well as power. The necessary sequences which have required for detecting the faults such stuck at/open faults, transition faults, etc. It can be detected easily with the help of this sequence generator. The large number of sequences can be generated with the help of cascading the smaller module. It is more efficient than LFSR. The whole designing has done in the 180 nm technology in Cadence’s spectre, virtuoso & assura tool...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Up-down {{counters}} {{are commonly}} used in the aerospace industry for fault detection thresholding. This paper applies the up-down counter technique to detect wind turbine faults. The thresholding problem involves a tradeoff between false alarms and missed detections. Counter based thresholding can detect smaller faults with higher probability and lower false alarms than is possible using simple constant thresholds. This improvement is achieved by effectively introducing dynamics into the thresholding logic as opposed to decisioning based on a single time step. <b>Up</b> <b>down</b> <b>counters</b> are applied {{to the development of}} a fault detection system for a commercial sized 4. 8 MW wind turbine. Realistic fault scenarios in the sensing, actuation and drivetrain subsystems are considered. It is seen that most faults can be detected with fast detection times and minimal false alarms without implementation of more complex filtering and detection techniques on residuals...|$|R
5000|$|Counters are {{primarily}} used for counting {{items such as}} cans going into a box on an assembly line. This is important because once something is filled to its max the item needs to be moved on so something else can be filled. Many companies use counters in PLC's to count boxes, count how many feet of something is covered, or to count how many pallets are on a truck. There are three types of <b>counters,</b> <b>Up</b> <b>counters,</b> <b>Down</b> <b>counters,</b> and Up/Down counters. Up counters count up to the preset value, turn on the CTU (CounT Up output) when the preset value is reached, and are cleared upon receiving a reset. <b>Down</b> <b>counters</b> count <b>down</b> from a preset value, turns on the CTD (CounT Down output) when 0 is reached, and are cleared upon reset. Up/Down counters count up on CU, count down on CD, turn on CTUD (CounT Up/Down output) when the preset value is reached, and cleared on reset.|$|R

In this work, a practical approach was taken, {{in an effort to}} validate the significance of the proposed Adaptive Power Management Algorithm (APMA), proposed for system developed, for this thesis project. This system comprise arithmetic and logic unit, <b>up</b> and <b>down</b> <b>counters,</b> adder, state machine and multiplexer. The essence of carrying this project firstly, is to develop a system that will be used for this power management project. Secondly, to perform area and power synopsis of the system on these various scalable technology platforms, UMC 90 nm nanotechnology 1. 2 v, UMC 90 nm nanotechnology 1. 32 v and UMC 0. 18 μmNanotechnology 1. 80 v, in order to examine the difference in area and power consumption of the system on the platforms. Thirdly, to explore various strategies {{that can be used to}} reducing system’s power consumption and to propose an adaptive power management algorithm that can be used to reduce the power consumption of the system. The strategies introduced in this work comprise Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS) and task parallelism. After the system development, it was run on FPGA board, basically NoC Platforms and on these various technology platforms UMC 90 nm nanotechnology 1. 2 v, UMC 90 nm nanotechnology 1. 32 v and UMC 180 nm nanotechnology 1. 80 v, the system synthesis was successfully accomplished, the simulated result analysis shows that the system meets all functional requirements, the power consumption and the area utilization were recorded and analyzed in chapter 7 of this work. This work extensively reviewed various strategies for managing power consumption which were quantitative research works by many researchers and companies, it's a mixture of study analysis and experimented lab works, it condensed and presents the whole basic concepts of power management strategy from quality technical papers...|$|R
