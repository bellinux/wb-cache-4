The results of this exploration are the identification and characterization of benefits of installed base information <b>use</b> <b>in</b> <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> operations, and the mechanisms which drive or hinder these benefits. Academic background and methodology This study was carried out as a qualitative multiple case study with five manufacturing companies, analyzing their current installed base information systems, the resulting benefits, and the mechanisms related to benefit realization. This study utilized existent literature on the use of installed base information <b>in</b> <b>after-sales</b> field <b>services</b> and industrial field services in capital equipment manufacturer’s service operations. Findings and conclusions It was found that there are common benefits realized through the use of installed base information across the case companies involved in this study. Increased reliability and faster service provisioning are mentioned by all case companies as realized or expected benefits of installed base information use. However, it was also found that the utilization of installed base information is still in its infancy and will take time to develop into successful systems and realized benefits...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – For {{more than}} ten years, the value of {{additive}} manufacturing (AM) for <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> logistics has been propagated. Today, however, only few applications are observed in practice. In this paper, possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed and a method is developed to simplify the identification of economically valuable and technologically feasible business cases. Design/methodology/approach – The approach {{is based on the}} Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and relies on spare part information that is easily retrievable from the company databases. This has two advantages: first, the approach can be customized towards specific company characteristics, and second, {{a very large number of}} spare parts may be assessed simultaneously. A field study is discussed in order to demonstrate and validate the approach in practice. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses are performed to evaluate the robustness of the method. Findings – Results provide evidence that the method allows a valid prioritization of a large spare part assortment. Also, sensitivity analyses clarify the robustness of the approach and illustrate the flexibility of applying the method in practice. More than 1000 positive business cases of AM for <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> logistics have been identified based on the method. Originality/value – The developed method enables companies to rank spare parts according to their potential value when produced with AM. As a result, companies can evaluate the most promising spare parts first. This increases the effectiveness and efficiency of identifying business cases and thus may support the adoption of AM <b>in</b> <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> supply chains...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - Drawing on the {{resource}} based view this study {{focuses on the}} influence of relational capability and marketing capabilities on export performance. The study also examines the interaction effects of relational capability on the marketing capabilities - export performance relationships. Design/ methodology/ approach - A stratified random sample of 1, 047 exporting firms were approached. Survey data was collected from 333 Vietnamese exporting firms and analysed using hierarchical moderated regression. Findings - The results reveal that a firm’s relational capability not only strengthens the efficiency of the export pricing capability – performance, marketing intelligence capability – performance, and marketing communication capability - performance relationships, but is also the strongest predictor of export performance amongst those capabilities identified. Whilst engagement in market intelligence, product development, price setting and promotional activities have a positive payoff, our findings confirm there is less need for exporters to engage <b>in</b> <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> and distribution capabilities. Originality/value - The study introduces the notion of relational capability alongside export marketing capabilities as predictors of export performance. We also examine the moderating influence of relational capability on the link between export marketing capabilities and export performance.

40|$|<b>After-sales</b> <b>service</b> {{is a major}} profit {{generator}} {{for more}} and more OEMs in industries with durable products. Successful engagement <b>in</b> <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> improves customer loyalty and allows for competitive differentiation through superior service like an extended service period after end of production during which customers are guaranteed to be provided with service parts. In order to fulfill the service guarantee in these cases, an effective and efficient spare parts management has to be implemented, which is challenging due to the high uncertainty concerning spare parts demand over such a long time horizon. The traditional way of spare parts acquisition for the service phase is to set up a huge final lot at the end of regular production of the parent product which is sufficient to fulfill demand up {{to the end of the}} service time. This strategy results in extremely high inventory levels over a long period and generates major holding costs and a high level of obsolescence risk. With increasing service time more flexible options for spare parts procurement after end of production gain more and more importance. In our paper we focus on the two most relevant ones, namely extra production and remanufacturing. Managing all three options leads to a complicated stochastic dynamic decision problem. For that problem type, however, a quite simple combined decision rule with order-up-to levels for extra production and remanufacturing turns out to be very effective. We propose a heuristic procedure for parameter determination which accounts for the main stochastic and dynamic interactions between the different order-up-to levels, but still consists of quite simple calculations so that it can be applied to problem instances of arbitrary size. In a numerical study we show that this heuristic performs extremely well under a wide range of conditions so that it can be strongly recommended as a decision support tool for the multi-option spare parts procurement problem.

40|$|Purpose – The {{primary purpose}} of this paper is to assess and review {{fixed-line}} telecom customers' perception of the quality of <b>after-sales</b> <b>services</b> provided by Ethiopian Telecom. Design/methodology/approach – The paper was conducted on telecom customers who are <b>in</b> Addis Ababa <b>using</b> self-administered questionnaires sent to a sample of 450 respondents. In addition to this, interviews were conducted with managers and selected employees to provide supporting data. The data were processed, analyzed and interpreted using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. Findings – The results show some degree of customer dissatisfaction, but not to the extent expected. Dissatisfied customers point at lack of clarities of bills and delays in making decisions on complaints as some of the main reasons for their dissatisfactions. Other reasons include telephone interruptions during rainy seasons, old cables and networks, and damaged and stolen cables, which combined, increase the frequency of faults and interruptions. Nearly 40 percent of respondents have negative assessments of the role of employees in delivering good quality <b>after-sales</b> <b>service.</b> Practical implications – Despite the fact that some improvements have been shown in recent reports, Ethiopian Telecom has a long way to go in achieving its objectives with respect to customers' satisfaction. Originality/value – Previous studies on telecommunication in Africa have not focused on service delivery and customer satisfaction.

40|$|Due {{to growing}} {{complexities}} in business-to-business products, {{the relationship between}} a seller and a buyer usually never ends after the purchase transaction. Customers buy augmented products, expecting bundle of values that come with the product which will satisfy the buyer. Thus, integrating services into the core offerings in manufacturing industries has taken crucial importance. Especially, <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> is considered a tool for enhancing a valuable advantage for the customer as well as it is a business opportunity for the company. <b>After-sales</b> <b>services</b> have proven to be of importance, and a strategic after-sales framework is necessary. Three major activities that play a crucial role within the <b>after-sales</b> <b>services</b> <b>in</b> the manufacturing industry are field technical assistance, spare parts distribution and customer care. However, intensive studies regarding <b>after-sales</b> <b>in</b> a specific industry are lacking. This thesis focuses on the Swedish heavy equipment machinery industry organizations of different sizes and thus, {{the purpose of this study}} is to investigate the major activities of <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> focusing on customer relationship among three classified sizes of <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> providers. A multiple case study has been carried out in the form of semi-structured interviews with three organizations; one small, one medium and one large size <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> providers. The study reveals that customer care is the most focused activity of <b>after-sales</b> <b>services</b> <b>in</b> the heavy equipment machinery industry in Sweden. Simultaneously, it shows the most significant differences of offers depending on the size of the company, in relation to the remaining activities.   Field technical assistance appears to be the part of after-sales that produces least profit in the industry. Thus, it might be the reason that small organizations would rather tend to outsource it, in order to avoid high costs.   Spare parts distribution can be considered as the most profitable activity of after-sales. The warehouses and repair centers of companies naturally varied according to firm sizes. Although the organizations do not state formal goals for providing <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> to its customers, they are aware of its importance and aim for satisfying customer demands. All organizations are convinced that if <b>after-sales</b> <b>services</b> are not handled properly, they face the risk of losing the customer.

This result is consistent with the following hypothesis: the more the number of <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> center is, the higher consumers are willing to pay for the laptop computers, when all other things being equal or held constant. The same conclusion can be applied to the case of the inclusion of OS; consumers are willing to pay more with the inclusion of OS. We have also found that <b>after-sale</b> <b>service</b> provided by laptop computer manufactures is not free, so that manufactures have a motivation to provide more <b>after-sale</b> <b>service</b> centers to get more profit...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is initiated from {{an increased}} awareness within industry {{of the importance}} of services in general and of <b>after-sales</b> <b>services</b> <b>in</b> particular. The scope of this research is to analyse how the specific characteristics of <b>after-sales</b> <b>services</b> affect a company’s manufacturing strategy, which in effect should become an operations strategy not only considering the manufacturing of goods. Considering the <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> as a product, consisting of both good and service characteristics, the objective of this dissertation is to develop conceptual models for an improved long-term management of operations where production of both new goods and <b>after-sales</b> <b>services</b> are competing for the same or similar resources. Specifically, the structural decision categories of a manufacturing strategy, process technology, capacity, facilities, and vertical integration, are adapted to include the demands of <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> products. The research result is an extension of the existing manufacturing strategy framework, which is transformed towards a more general operations strategy framework capable of providing managerial guidance for a larger set of products than just pure goods. Tools are developed for analysing what processes would be suitable for the <b>after-sales</b> <b>services,</b> and whether the after-sales processes should be merged with, or separated from, the new goods process. An extended long term service capacity framework is also introduced, looking specifically at the needs of <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> operations. Through seven case studies as well as a survey of 45 Italian providers of both manufactured goods and <b>services,</b> the <b>after-sales</b> supply chain is mapped and classified with respect to vertical integration and facilities...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{authors of}} this study {{systematically}} investigated multiple relationships between brand awareness, channel, perceived web quality, and perceived quality toward <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> of the all-in-one office products’ company in Bangkok, Thailand. The sales of some single-function products decline after {{the opening of a}} multifunction product. Based on marketing theories, flow theory, and the technology acceptance model, independent variables such as brand, channel, perceived web quality, and perceived quality should relate to <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> of the company. However, the multiple regression statistic method revealed that only channel, perceived web quality, and perceived quality were positively related to <b>after-sale</b> <b>service</b> of the company...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} to apply the quality {{function}} deployment (QFD) model in the Chinese heavy construction equipment market to improve the <b>after-sales</b> <b>service.</b> The main objectives {{of this study are}} {{to find out how to}} translate the customers’ needs into technical measurements by this QFD model for the supplier company and also to find out the priority and importance of each technical measurement to design the <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> model for the Chinese heavy construction equipment market. The main literature reviews are focusing on the comparison of the differences of <b>after-sales</b> models <b>in</b> the Western and Eastern markets and how to decrease the customers’ dissatisfaction of <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> by using the QFD model. Moreover, in this study there is a specific introduction of the QFD model and its core part, the house of quality (HOQ). And there is also an introduction of the focus group method which is used to define the research attributes in the QFD model. After the literature review and methodology introduction, there is a case study based on the company X from China. This company is a leading company in the Chinese heavy construction equipment market. By applying the data which is collected from the company X and its customers into the QFD model, there is possibility to make the guide that how to improve the <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> <b>in</b> the Chinese heavy construction equipment market. In this study, firstly we can know how the QFD model can be <b>used</b> <b>in</b> the service improvements, and then we can know how to improve the <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> by utilizing the QFD model in the Chinese heavy construction equipment market and also design the appropriate <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> model for this specific market...|$|R
