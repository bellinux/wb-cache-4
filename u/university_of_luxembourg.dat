The decision in 1985 to declare Lëtzebuergesch (Luxembourgish) the national language was also a step in the affirmation of the country’s independence. In fact, the linguistic situation in Luxembourg was characterised by trilingualism: Lëtzebuergesch was the spoken vernacular language, German the written language, in which Luxembourgers were most fluent, and French the language of official letters and law.|$|E

40|$|This {{project was}} {{a joint effort}} <b>of</b> two <b>university</b> centres 45 and deals with the {{different}} forms of participation or involvement {{in the implementation of}} sustainable development policies. "Participation" {{is an important part of}} policies like these. It is currently the subject of much analysis and can be expressed in many ways. In this regard, the project has attempted to: - clarify the concepts studied, referring to existing theories and practices and identifying trends - understand the conditions and forms of participation in sustainable development policies, in the case of the public authorities and in the case of the different categories of players involved. These two approaches are different and complementary. The IGEAT team <b>of</b> the Free <b>University</b> <b>of</b> Brussels (ULB) focuses on the institutional dimension (the more organised forms of participation) and on the role of organised social actors whereas the SEED team <b>of</b> the <b>University</b> Faculty <b>of</b> <b>Luxembourg</b> (FUL) is more concerned with the social dynamics and reorganisation resulting from this participation. Also, the first team turned its attention to socio-economic problems while the second team examined territorial dynamics. D/ 2002 / 1191 / 41 info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
