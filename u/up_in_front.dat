5|$|Carabane {{has many}} {{historic}} sites, {{such as the}} Catholic mission house built in 1880 which has since {{been turned into a}} hotel, a Brittany-style church building which is no longer in use, and a former slave-trade building. There is also a French cemetery where a Troupes de marine-Captain with the name Aristide Protet was shot with a poisoned arrow and buried standing <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the sea, according to his last wishes. Some tour guides falsely claim that this was Auguste Léopold Protet, the founder of the city of Dakar, but the name Aristide Protet is clearly shown on the tomb's plaque.|$|E
5|$|Typically, the labial palpi are prominent, three-segmented, {{springing}} {{from under}} the head and curving <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the face. There is great variation in morphology of labial palpi in different families of Lepidoptera; sometimes the palpi are separate and sometimes they are connivent and form a beak, but they are always independently movable. In other cases, the labial palpi may not be erect but porrect (projecting forward horizontally).|$|E

5|$|Count Horn {{directed}} the Prince of Holstein-Beck {{to take the}} village, but his two Dutch brigades were cut down by the French and Irish troops, capturing and badly wounding the Prince during the action. The battle was now in the balance. If Holstein-Beck's Dutch column were destroyed, the Allied army would be split in two: Eugene's wing would be isolated from Marlborough's, passing the initiative to the Franco-Bavarian forces now engaged across the whole plain. Seeing the opportunity, Marsin ordered his cavalry to change from facing Eugene, and turn towards their right and the open flank of Churchill's infantry drawn <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of Unterglau. Marlborough (who had crossed the Nebel on a makeshift bridge to take personal control), ordered Hulsen's Hanoverian battalions to support the Dutch infantry. A Dutch cavalry brigade under Averock was also called forward but soon came under pressure from Marsin's more numerous squadrons.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Rachel {{decides to}} return to her community. Mr. Will is bailed out of jail by Tim, who is looking for Rachel. Together, he and Mr. Will drive out to the community, and on the way they {{discover}} Clyde, whose van has broken down on the highway. As Rachel is about to be wed, Tim, Mr. Will, and Clyde pull <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the church in the red Mustang and rescue her. Mr. Will returns to the community and is accepted back with a confession that Rachel has recorded on the blue cassette, although she still firmly believes that God has fathered her child. Some months later, Clyde and a visibly pregnant Rachel are living in a tent by the beach and hold hands as they walk through the waves.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{discussion}} with Pete about women and commitment, Adam argues with Rachel and angrily leaves her flat. Seconds later Simon returns, telling Rachel he has turned down the Hong Kong job. After getting locked out the house, Karen interrupts a seminar David is holding, demanding they get a nanny. He relents, embarrassed after being shown <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of his colleagues. Determined to get Rachel back, Adam goes to Simon's flat, where he serenades her wearing nothing but a rose between his buttocks. Jenny and Pete arrive to find Simon chasing a naked Adam down the street. The fight is interrupted by a passing policeman, who lists multiple felonies Adam has committed, until Rachel steps forward and takes the blame for what has happened. She declares her love to Adam and the two leave. Pete and Jenny watch and she tells him her last pregnancy test was positive.|$|E

5|$|Tickets {{were made}} {{available}} to members of Madonna's official fan club, Icon, and winners with details announced at Madonna.com and through concert promoter Telstra's promotional webpage. According to newspaper reports, the tickets were non-transferable, and had the person's name printed on them. However, {{all of them were}} in the general admission category at Forum Theatre, which holds a maximum capacity of 1,500. With the production design and addition of catwalk, the space allocated became smaller than that. Prior to the show The Sydney Morning Herald reported that fans started queuing <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the venue, while Madonna rehearsed inside, as well as at Hisense Arena. Images and songs rehearsed were leaked to fan website Drownedmadonna.com, along with Madonna's manager Guy Oseary uploading pictures on Instagram. Madonna made several references to clowns on her own Instagram account, including uploading a short video of her riding a small tricycle. The show was confirmed to be recorded and released along with the DVD for the Rebel Heart Tour.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} week at Bristol, while running 5th, leader Denny Hamlin was wrecked by Kevin Harvick while racing for the lead, which then sent Hamlin's {{car into the}} inside wall. Hamlin's car then slid right back <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the No. 88 and slammed into the left-side door of the car, and the contact was bad enough to send Earnhardt behind the wall, and suffer a 39th-place finish. This was his second DNF of the year, after the early exit in the spring Texas race.|$|E
