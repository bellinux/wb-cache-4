3000|$|..., {{equation}} (1) {{is called}} Laplace’s equation which arises naturally {{in many areas}} of engineering and science, especially in wave propagation and vibration phenomena such as the vibration of a structure [1], the acoustic cavity problem [2], the radiation wave [3] and the scattering of a wave [4]. For example, certain problems related to the search for mineral resources, which involve interpretation of the earth’s gravitational and magnetic fields, are equivalent to the Cauchy problem for Laplace’s equation. In another application of geophysical <b>underground</b> <b>prospection,</b> the geoelectrical method has been initiated in recent years (see the historical account in Zhdanov and Keller [5]). In fact, by now the geoelectrical method involves, even in its most basic formulation, the solution of the Cauchy problem for Laplace’s equation.|$|E
