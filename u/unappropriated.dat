Gilkeson was elected {{to fill the}} seat during the general election of 1890 and served the remainder of Flournoy's senate term until 1893. At {{the time of his}} appointment, the Twelfth Senatorial District consisted of Grant, Hampshire, Hardy, Mineral, and Pendleton counties. In 1892, Gilkeson was appointed to the Committees on the Judiciary, Public Buildings and Humane Institutions, Federal Relations, Forfeited, Delinquent, and <b>Unappropriated</b> Lands, and Clerks Office. In addition to serving in the state senate, Gilkeson also held the position of mayor of Romney, West Virginia, beginning in 1885.|$|E
25|$|Malta {{first issued}} revenue stamps in 1899, when {{the island was}} a British colony. From that year to 1912, all revenue issues were postage stamps overprinted accordingly, with the {{overprinting}} being done either locally or by De La Rue in London. Postage stamps also became valid for fiscal use from 1912–13, so no new revenues were issued until 1925–30, when a series of key type stamps depicting King George V were issued. These exist <b>unappropriated</b> for use as general-duty revenues, or with additional inscriptions indicating a specific use (Applications, Contracts, Registers or Stocks & Shares). The only other revenues after this series were £1 stamps issued in 1941, 1948 and 1954. Postage stamps remained valid for fiscal use until at least the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Smith, {{although}} {{running for}} his campaign, {{would refuse to}} leave without beginning the skeleton of a new park and parkway system for Long Island {{and make sure the}} land needed would be in property of the state. Smith continued ripping the politicians and that they were on the side of those in Wheatley Hills and pledged to keep the parkway out of their neighborhood. However, Smith argued that the sentiment had changed in Wheatley Hills and that most of the residents were in support of the project. However, Hewitt and Hutchinson refused to permit the money because they would not touch any money until the Southern State Parkway was completed. Smith denied that agreement ever occurred. The money {{that was supposed to be}} use was from <b>unappropriated</b> state land in New York City. The money for purchasing land would go to those who agreed with the LISPC on prices or those who could not afford to give away the land.|$|E

The colony's last royal governor, William Franklin, granted and signed a charter on behalf of Britain's King George III. The congregation petitioned the East Jersey Board of Proprietors, a colonial land agency, asking for their assistance to establish a church. The board granted a warrant for [...] of land yet <b>unappropriated</b> in Sussex County {{to serve as an}} income-generating glebe to support the church. The tract chosen by the congregation was located approximately [...] south of Newton (in present-day Fredon Township, then part of Hardwick Township) and conveyed to the church on 16 December 1774 by the colony's last royal attorney general, Cortlandt Skinner, and John Johnston. Jonathan Hampton (1716–1777), a landowner, coachmaker, and merchant from Elizabethtown, deeded lands from his surveyed town plot to the congregation on 14 December 1774 [...] "for the encouragement of the Episcopal religion...and toward the maintenance & support of a parson officiating in said church".|$|E

2500|$|Dividend {{policy is}} {{concerned}} with financial policies regarding the payment of a cash dividend in the present or paying an increased dividend at a later stage.

When cash surplus exists and is not needed by the firm, then management is expected to pay out some or all of those surplus earnings in the form of cash dividends or to repurchase the company's stock through a share buyback program.|$|E

(2001). This approach is designed for two-class problems, and we extend it towards multi-class classification. The advantage of a multi-class boosting algorithm is its usage in scene interpretation with various kinds of objects. In these cases, two-class approaches will lead to several one class versus background (the other classes) classifications, where we must solve <b>unappropriate</b> results like ”always background ” or ”two or more valid classes ” for a sample. ...|$|R

So {{out of the way}} (and therefore the smugglers) was the inn behind the sea wall, in the 18th century it was known as 'The World's End'. In the 19th century, the isolation made it an ideal point for the meetings of pugilists. The row of Preventive Men's Cottages has survived against the odds. Today they are surrounded by a small housing estate.|$|E
2500|$|Corporate finance {{deals with}} the sources funding and the capital {{structure}} of corporations, the actions that managers take to increase {{the value of the}} firm to the shareholders, and the tools and analysis used to allocate financial resources. [...] Although it is in principle different from managerial finance which studies the financial management of all firms, rather than corporations alone, the main concepts in the study of corporate finance are applicable to the financial problems of all kinds of firms. [...] Corporate finance generally involves balancing risk and profitability, while attempting to maximize an entity's assets, net incoming cash flow and the value of its stock, and generically entails three primary areas of capital resource allocation. In the first, [...] "capital budgeting", management must choose which [...] "projects" [...] (if any) to undertake. The discipline of capital budgeting may employ standard business valuation techniques or even extend to real options valuation; see Financial modeling. [...] The second, [...] "sources of capital" [...] relates to how these investments are to be funded: investment capital can be provided through different sources, such as by shareholders, in the form of equity (privately or via an initial public offering), creditors, often in the form of bonds, and the firm's operations (cash flow). Short-term funding or working capital is mostly provided by banks extending a line of credit. The balance between these elements forms the company's capital structure. [...] The third, [...] "the dividend policy", requires management to determine whether any <b>unappropriated</b> profit (excess cash) is to be retained for future investment / operational requirements, or instead to be distributed to shareholders, and if so, in what form. [...] Short term financial management is often termed [...] "working capital management", and relates to cash-, inventory- and debtors management.|$|E

40|$|Structure of eigenstates in a {{periodic}} quasi- 1 D waveguide with a rough surface is studied both analytically and numerically. We {{have found a}} large number of "regular" eigenstates for any high energy. They result in a very slow convergence to the classical limit in which the eigenstates are expected to be completely ergodic. As a consequence, localization properties of eigenstates originated from unperturbed transverse channels with low indexes, are strongly localized (delocalized) in the momentum (coordinate) representation. These eigenstates were found to have a quite unexpeted form that manifests a kind of "repulsion" from the rough surface. Our results indicate that standard statistical approaches for ballistic localization in such waveguides seem to be <b>unappropriate.</b> Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
