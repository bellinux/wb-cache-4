40|$|Diffusion tensor imaging {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the accurate diagnosis and prognosis of spinal cord diseases. However, because of technical limitations, the imaging sequences used in this technique cannot reveal the fine structure of the spinal cord with precision. We used the readout segmentation of long variable echo-trains (RESOLVE) sequence in this cross-sectional study of 45 healthy volunteers aged 20 to 63 years. We found that the RESOLVE sequence significantly increased the resolution of the diffusion images and improved the median signal-to-noise ratio of the middle (C 4 – 6) and lower (C 7 –T 1) cervical segments to the level of the <b>upper</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>segment.</b> In addition, the values of fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity were significantly higher in white matter than in gray matter.

50|$|The interstitiospinal tract {{is one of}} ten {{descending}} neuronal tracts {{in humans}} that provides motor control to specific <b>upper</b> <b>cervical</b> somatic <b>segments.</b> The origin of this uncrossed tract is in the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (related to the oculomotor nucleus) which is subsequently found in the Edinger-Westphal nucleus of the midbrain.

40|$|Injections of WGA-HRP {{were made}} within the C 1 segment of spinal cord in cats with a midsagittal {{section of the}} midbrain. A small number of {{labelled}} cells {{were found in the}} latero-caudal part of the deeper layers of the superior colliclus (SC) ipsilateral to the injection sites. Because of the complete section of the dorsal tegmental decussation, these results definitively demonstrate the existence of an ipsilateral tecto-spinal pathway projecting to <b>upper</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>segments</b> in the cat. Ipsilaterally projecting tecto-reticulo-spinal neurons represent about 5 % of the total population of tecto-spinal neurons. They were exclusively located in the deeper collicular layers and most of them were found in the latero-caudal part of the SC. Comparison with our previous studies suggests that more ipsilateral tecto-spinal projections that found after the section of the dorsal tegmental decussation probably exist. They may arise from tecto-reticulo-spinal neurons recrossing the midline in the brainstem or in the rostral part of C 1. By analogy with the cortico-spinal tract, we suggest that the existence of an ipsilateral tecto-spinal pathway can be regarded as evidence for a substantial development of the cat tecto-spinal system as compared with other mammals...|$|R

40|$|In {{adult male}} and female Japanese quail, aromatase-immunoreactive cells were {{identified}} in the spinal dorsal horns from the <b>upper</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>segments</b> to the lower caudal area. These immunoreactive cells are located mostly in laminae I-III, with additional sparse cells being present in the medial part of lamina V and, at the cervical level exclusively, in lamina X around the central canal. Radioenzyme assays based on the measurement of tritiated water release confirmed the presence of substantial levels of aromatase activity throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the spinal cord. Contrary to what is observed in the brain, this enzyme activity {{and the number of}} aromatase-immunoreactive cells in five representative segments of the spinal cord are not different in sexually mature males or females and are not influenced in males by castration with or without testosterone treatment.

40|$|Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) {{is rarely}} applied in {{spinal cord injury}} (SCI). The {{aim of this study}} was to {{correlate}} diffusion properties after SCI with electrophysiological and neurological measures. Nineteen traumatic cervical SCI subjects and 28 age-matched healthy subjects participated in this study. DTI data of the spinal cord were acquired with a Philips Achieva 3 T MR scanner using an outer volume suppressed, reduced field of view (FOV) acquisition with oblique slice excitation and a single-shot EPI readout. Neurological and electrophysiological measures, American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale scores, and motor (MEP) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) were assessed in SCI subjects. Fractional anisotropy (FA) values were decreased in the SCI subjects compared to the healthy subjects. In <b>upper</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>segments,</b> the decrease in FA was significant for the evaluation of the entire cross-sectional area of the spinal cord, and for corticospinal and sensory tracts. A decreasing trend was also found at the thoracic level for the corticospinal tracts. The decrease of DTI values correlated with the clinical completeness of SCI, and with SSEP amplitudes. The reduced DTI values seen in the SCI subjects are likely due to demyelination and axonal degeneration of spinal tracts, which are related to clinical and electrophysiological measures. A reduction in DTI values in regions remote from the injury site suggests their involvement with wallerian axonal degeneration. DTI can be used for the quantitative evaluation of the extent of spinal cord damage, and eventually to monitor the effects of future regeneration-inducing treatments...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{document}} the kinematics of the neck during low-speed rear-end impacts. In a series of experiments reported by Deng et al (2000), a pneumatically driven mini-sled was used to study cervical spine motion using six cadavers instrumented with metallic markers at each cervical level, a 9 -accelerometer mount on the head, and a tri-axial accelerometers on the thorax. A 250 -Hz x-ray system was used to record marker motion while acceleration data were digitized at 10, 000 Hz. Results show that, in the global coordinate system, the head and all cervical vertebrae were primarily in extension during the entire period of x-ray data collection. In local coordinate systems, <b>upper</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>segments</b> were initially in relative flexion while lower segments were in extension. Facet joint capsular stretch ranged from 17 to 97 %. In the vertical direction, the head and T 1 accelerated upward almost instantaneously after impact initiation while there was delay for the head in the horizontal direction. This combination was the result of a force vector which was pointed in the forward and upward direction to generate an extension moment. Upward ramping of the torso was larger in tests with a 20 -deg seatback angle. The study concluded that the kinematics of the neck is rather complicated and greatly influenced by the large rotations of the thoracic spine. Significant posterior shear deformation was found, as evidenced by the large facet capsular stretch. Although the neck forms a 'mild' S-shaped curve during whiplash, using its shape as an injury mechanism can be misleading because the source of pain is likely to be located in the facet capsules...|$|R
40|$|FIG. 3. -Patient after {{surgical}} repair. {{were replaced}} within the spinal canal. The meninges were repaired and the bony defect covered by {{two layers of}} lumbar fascia. There was some superficial wound infection, as there had been after the first operation, but healing was complete after 17 days (Fig. 3). No change in the neurological state of the legs occurred but it was noticed {{that the child was}} passing urine very frequently and was constantly wet. Follow-up. At the age of 9 months, the child was alert and progressing normally. Her head circum-ference was 43 cm and {{there was no evidence of}} hydro-cephalus. The neurological function of the legs had returned to normal, and the mother declared that she was no longer wet and had normal sphincter function. Discussion The presence of two distinct spinal meningoceles is very unusual. Potter (1962) says that she has observed 2 cases in the dorsal and lumbar regions, in one of which there was an associated hydro-cephalus and Arnold-Chiari malformation. Bertan and Wilson (1968) described a case of combined thoracic and lumbosacral myelomeningocele. This child also developed hydrocephalus after successful excision of both sacs and succumbed to septicaemia after the insertion of a ventriculoatrial shunt. Occipital meningoceles are often associated with spina bifida of the <b>upper</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>segments,</b> and in severe cases may constitute an encephalomyelocele. In such cases, however, there is no segment of normal spine in between the occipital and the spinal defects. Fahrenkrug and H 0 jgaard (1963) described the radiological findings in multiple paravertebral lumbar meningoceles, but their patient was not operated upon. Meningoceles have been described with other congenital anomalies of the vertebral column, while hydrocephalus and the Arnold-Chiari malformation are common associations. Von Recklinghausen's disease is frequently found with intrathoracic meningoceles, but its rare coexistence with lumbo-sacral meningoceles and meningomyeloceles is regarded as no more than coincidental (Levene...|$|R
40|$|Headache (cephalalgia) is an {{extremely}} common unpleasant symptom. The main factors contributing for cervicogenic and tension type headache is due to myofascial trigger points, muscle tightness and decreased mobility at suboccipital muscles and <b>upper</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>segments</b> and also proposed significant correlation between forward head posture and headache. Neuroanatomical explaination of both headaches is due to increase sensitization of trigeminocervical nucleus through trigeminocervico nucleus caudalis. These sensitizations of trigeminal nucleus caudalis happen due to increase peripheral nociceptive input from myofascial trigger points in suboccipital muscles. Treatment approaches to overcome headache, includes pharmacological, non-pharmacological, anesthetic and surgical intervention. In that spinal manipulation {{found to be more}} effective. METHODOLOGY: Prior to intervention the parameters like VAS, NDI, HDI and CROM were measured for both the groups and underwent IDT for 4 weeks at a rate of 3 sessions per week. Outcome measures were taken at 2 nd and 4 th week. SUBJECTS: 30 subjects both male and female of age groups 25 – 45 years who has been diagnosed as CH & TTH on the basis of IHS referred by physician KRH Mysore.

40|$|CONTEXT/OBJECTIVE To {{verify the}} {{hypothesis}} that motor levels (ML) inferred from sensory levels in the <b>upper</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>segments</b> C 2 -C 4 according to {{the current version of}} the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) are counterintuitive in cases where the most rostral myotomes C 5 and C 6 are graded as intact. DESIGN Prospective cohort study of ISNCSCI instructional course participants completing a post-test after the workshop to determine the MLs in two variants of a complete, high cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) case scenario. Both variants were based on the same ISNCSCI sensory and MLs of C 2. In the first variant myotomes C 5 and C 6 were bilaterally graded as intact, while in variant 2 only active movements against gravity were possible (grade 3). SETTING Eight ISNCSCI instructional courses conducted during the study period from November 2012 until March 2015 in the framework of the European Multicenter Study on Human Spinal Cord Injury (EMSCI- [URL]). PARTICIPANTS Ninety-two clinicians from twenty-two SCI centers. Most of the attendees were physicians (58. 7 %) or physical therapists (33. 7 %) and had less than one year (44. 6 %) experience in SCI medicine. INTERVENTIONS Not applicable. OUTCOME MEASURE The classification performance described as percentage of correctly determined MLs by the clinicians. RESULTS Variant 2 (89. 13 %) was significantly (P[*]<[*] 0. 0001) better classified than variant 1 (65. 76 %). In variant 1 with intact myotomes at C 5 and C 6, C 6 was incorrectly classified as the ML by the clinicians in 33. 15 % of all cases, whereas in variant 2 with non-intact C 5 / C 6 myotomes, C 6 was rarely chosen (2. 17 %). CONCLUSIONS Sensory level deferred MLs in the high cervical region of C 2 -C 4 are counterintuitive whenever the most rostral cervical myotomes are intact. An adjustment of the ML definition in ISNCSCI may be needed...|$|R

Seven electronic databases were searched up to July 2003, article reference lists were screened and an expert panel elicited to obtain relevant trials. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria and key data was extracted. Two reviewers assessed the validity of the studies using the Cochrane format and found that all studies had low methodological quality. However, a consistent finding was that all studies had a positive result with significant improvement in symptoms and signs of dizziness after manual therapy treatment. Therefore, Level 3 evidence for manual therapy treatment of cervicogenic dizziness was obtained indicating it should be considered in the management of patients with this disorder provided there is evidence of improvement.

These cells represent about 30 % of all neurons in the entire spinal cord projecting to PAG and about 45 % of all spinothalamic neurons. About half of the C 1 –C 3 PAG and C 1 –C 3 thalamic neurons were clustered laterally in the ventral horn (C 1 – 3 vl), bilaterally, with a slight ipsilateral preponderance. The highest numbers of C 1 – 3 vl-PAG and C 1 – 3 vl-thalamic cells were found in C 1, with the greatest density rostrocaudally in the middle part of C 1.

This study provides a unique and important opportunity to correlate pre-hospital cervical spine treatment with detailed post-mortem cervical spine dissection. Twenty-five of 159 victims of fatal road trauma occurring in a five-month period were treated by ambulance and hospital staff. Cervical injury was sustained by 15 of the victims; injury involved all structures in the cervical spine. The greatest incidence of injury was to the <b>upper</b> <b>cervical</b> motion <b>segments</b> with intramuscular haemorrhage (especially at C 1 - 2) the most frequently seen. Treatment was divided into pre-hospital and hospital care. The primary mode of pre-hospital treatment for cervical trauma was the Vertebrace extrication collar, a specialised cervical collar. The Vertebrace was used in 88 per cent of victims while supplementary supports were employed in 79 per cent of cases. Only 56 per cent of patients underwent cervical x-rays during hospital treatment and a number of these films unsatisfactorily visualised the spine.

40|$|Objective. -To {{investigate}} if and to {{what extent}} typical head pain can be reproduced in tension-type headache (TTH), migraine without aura sufferers, and controls when sustained pressure was applied to the lateral posterior arch of C 1 and the articular pillar of C 2, stressing the atlantooccipital and C 2 - 3 segments respectively. Background. -Occipital and neck symptoms often accompany primary headache, suggesting involvement of cervical afferents in central pain processing mechanisms in these disorders. Referral of head pain from <b>upper</b> <b>cervical</b> structures is made possible by convergence of cervical and trigeminal nociceptive afferent information in the trigemino-cervical nucleus. <b>Upper</b> <b>cervical</b> segmental and C 2 - 3 zygapophysial joint dysfunction is recognized as a potential source of noxious afferent information and is present in primary headache sufferers. Furthermore, referral of head pain has been demonstrated from symptomatic <b>upper</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>segments</b> and the C 2 - 3 zygapophysial joints, suggesting that head pain referral may be a characteristic of cervical afferent involvement in headache. Methods. -Thirty-four headache sufferers and 14 controls were examined interictally. Headache patients were diagnosed according the criteria of the International Headache Society and comprised 20 migraine without aura (females n = 18; males n = 2; average age 35. 3 years) and 14 TTH sufferers (females n = 11; males n = 3; average age 30. 7 years). Two techniques were used specifically to stress the atlantooccipital segments (Technique 1 - C 1) and C 2 - 3 zygapophysial joints (Technique 2 - C 2). Two techniques were also applied to the arm - the common extensor origin and the mid belly of the biceps brachii. Participants reported reproduction of head pain with "yes" or "no" and rated the intensity of head pain and local pressure of application on a scale of 0 - 10, where 0 = no pain and 10 = intolerable pain. Results. -None of the subjects reported head pain during application of techniques on the arm. Head pain referral during the cervical examination was reported by 8 of 14 (57 %) control participants, all TTH patients and all but 1 migraineur (P <. 002). In each case, participants reported that the referred head pain was similar to the pain they usually experienced during TTH or migraine. The frequency of head pain referral was identical for Techniques 1 and 2. The intensity of referral did not differ between Technique 1 and Technique 2 or between groups. Tenderness ratings to thumb pressure were comparable between the Techniques 1 and 2 when pressure was applied to C 1 and C 2 respectively and across groups. Similarly, {{there were no significant differences}} for tenderness ratings to thumb pressure between Technique 1 and Technique 2 on the arm or between groups. While tenderness ratings to thumb pressure for Technique 2 were similar for both referral (n = 41) and non-referral (n = 7) groups, tenderness ratings for Technique 1 in the referral group were significantly greater when compared with the non-referral group (P =. 01). Conclusions. -Our data support the continuum concept of headache, one in which noxious cervical afferent information may well be significantly underestimated. The high incidence of reproduction of headache supports the evaluation of musculoskeletal features in patients presenting with migrainous and TTH symptoms. This, in turn, may have important implications for understanding the pathophysiology of headache and developing alternative treatment options...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The work {{contained}} {{in this thesis}} encompasses four studies to examine the validity of clinical testing for clinical instability of the craniovertebral region. Validity was explored through the utilisation and exploration of the constructs of convention, biological plausibility and empirical proof. Consensual validity for clinical testing was explored through a survey of knowledge and attitudes to instability testing in a nationwide survey involving 1528 Australian physiotherapists. Details of respondents’ understanding {{of the concept of}} instability, potential clinical presentations of patients with segmental hypermobility of the <b>upper</b> <b>cervical</b> spine, knowledge of published clinical stress tests, attitudes toward performing these clinical tests and inclusion of craniovertebral testing procedures in clinical guidelines were all assessed. On the basis of the information returned, it appears that the level of knowledge and understanding of these disorders, their clinical presentation, assessment and their risk factors is low. Understanding of the clinical testing manoeuvres was also poor, with the majority of respondents never applying these tests clinically. Completion of post-graduate coursework in musculoskeletal physiotherapy clearly improved exposure to these concepts and tests in respondents, but did not significantly affect use of testing for screening prior to treatment of the <b>upper</b> <b>cervical</b> spine overall. Consensual validity for clinical testing of craniovertebral instability must be considered to be low based upon the absence of agreement of the existence, presentation and assessment of the disorder. Biological plausibility of testing was explored through examination of the morphology of the ligaments of the craniovertebral region. Observations made during the dissection of 11 cadaveric specimens were mostly in accordance with descriptions of the anatomy upon which the clinical test procedures have been based. However, the tectorial membrane was observed to be a more complex structure than has previously been understood with its fibre arrangement suggesting a role as a potentially limiting structure to axial rotation of the <b>upper</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>segments.</b> The existence of the previously reported ‘atlantal’ portion of the alar ligaments was also challenged. It was not observed in any specimen examined and the presence of these bands of tissue in any individual should be considered an anatomical variant. Overall, the gross morphology of the craniovertebral ligaments observed being consistent with the basis of the clinical tests confers face validity on the testing procedures. The biological basis for testing was further explored using magnetic resonance imaging of six specimens at high (4. 6 T) and clinical (3. 0 T) definition acquisitions. Observations were confirmed by dissection and the accuracy of measurements and observations assessed. Again, the gross morphology was consistent with the structural assumptions underpinning the clinical tests, thus enhancing their face validity. Clinical acquisitions were compared using three different sequences to assess the optimal acquisition sequence to be used in subsequent patient studies. Proton density-weighted sequences were found to be superior in identification, delineation and measurement of the ligaments of this region. Empirical proof that clinical tests are capable of influencing the ligaments of this region was addressed in the final study. The <b>upper</b> <b>cervical</b> spines of 16 healthy volunteers were imaged using MRI in both neutral and end-range clinical test positions. Ligaments were assessed using both direct measurement and indirect estimates of bony displacement. Statistically significant changes in ligament dimension were demonstrated for the ligaments in all tests examined. Direct evidence that the ligament may be influenced in a predictable manner through the imposition of clinical tests provides a strong case for the establishment of construct validity for each of these described clinical tests. Through utilising the three axioms of convention, biological plausibility and empirical proof, a number of aspects of the validity of clinically testing the craniovertebral region for instability have been assessed. Whilst the consensual validity of testing appears poor, the case for face validity and construct validity for the ligament stress tests is strong suggesting that further research is warranted which may now potentially involve individuals with demonstrable instabilities of this region...|$|R

Given the absence of validation of these tests and the potential consequences if manipulation is applied to an unstable <b>upper</b> <b>cervical</b> spine <b>segment,</b> exploration of these tests is necessary. Objective: The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the direct effect of the side-bending and rotation stress tests on alar ligaments using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Design: This was a within-participant experimental study. Methods: Sixteen participants underwent MRI in neutral and end-range stress test positions using proton density-weighted sequences in a 3 -Tesla system. Measurements followed a standardized protocol relative to the position of the axis. Distances were measured from dens tip to the inferior margin of the foramen magnum and from midsubstance of the dental attachment of the ligament to its occipital insertion. Between-side differences were calculated for each measurement to account for inherent asymmetries in morphology. Differences were compared between the test and neutral positions using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results: Side-bending stress tests produced a median between-side difference in ligament length of + 1. 15 mm. Rotation stress tests produced a median between-side difference in ligament length of + 2. 08 mm. Both results indicate increased measurement of the contralateral alar ligament. Limitations: Assessment could be made only in the neutral position due to imaging limitations. Clinical texts state that tests should be performed in 3 positions: neutral, flexion, and extension. Conclusions: Both side-bending and rotation stress testing result in a measurable increase in length of the contralateral alar ligament. This finding is consistent with mechanisms that have been described to support their use in clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spinal cord atrophy is {{a common}} and {{clinically}} relevant characteristic in multiple sclerosis. We aimed to perform a multicenter validation study of mean <b>upper</b> <b>cervical</b> cord area measurements in patients with multiple sclerosis and healthy controls from head MR images and to explore the effect of gadolinium administration on mean <b>upper</b> <b>cervical</b> cord area measurements. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recruited 97 subjects from 3 centers, including 60 patients with multiple sclerosis of different disease types and 37 healthy controls. Both cervical cord and head 3 D T 1 -weighted images were acquired. In 11 additional patients from 1 center, head images before and after gadolinium administration and cervical cord images after gadolinium administration were acquired. The mean <b>upper</b> <b>cervical</b> cord area was compared between cervical cord and head images by using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for both consistency (ICCconsist) and absolute (ICCabs) agreement. RESULTS: There was excellent agreement of mean <b>upper</b> <b>cervical</b> cord area measurements from head and cervical cord images in the entire group (ICCabs = 0. 987) and across centers and disease subtypes. The mean absolute difference between the mean <b>upper</b> <b>cervical</b> cord area measured from head and cervical cord images was 2 mm(2) (2. 3 %). Additionally, excellent agreement {{was found between the}} mean <b>upper</b> <b>cervical</b> cord area measured from head images with and without gadolinium administration (ICCabs = 0. 991) and between the cervical cord and head images with gadolinium administration (ICCabs = 0. 992). CONCLUSIONS: Excellent agreement between mean <b>upper</b> <b>cervical</b> cord area measurements on head and cervical cord images was observed in this multicenter study, implying that <b>upper</b> <b>cervical</b> cord atrophy can be reliably measured from head images. Postgadolinium head or cervical cord images may also be suitable for measuring mean <b>upper</b> <b>cervical</b> cord area...|$|R

The SNA was found to extend from the caudal one fifth of the medulla oblongata to the cranial one fourth of the sixth <b>cervical</b> <b>segment.</b> In the caudal part of the medulla oblongata, the SNA was located in the dorsal part of the detached ventral grey column. In the first <b>cervical</b> <b>segment,</b> the SNA was dorsolateral to the dorsomedial column and dorsal to the ventromedial column of the ventral grey column.
