50|$|The {{capacitive}} effect of long underground or undersea cables in AC transmission applications {{also applies to}} AC overhead lines, although to a much lesser extent. Nevertheless, for a long AC overhead transmission line, the current flowing just to charge the line capacitance can be significant, and this reduces the capability of the line to carry <b>useful</b> <b>current</b> to the load at the remote end. Another factor that reduces the <b>useful</b> <b>current</b> carrying ability of AC lines is the skin effect, which causes a non-uniform distribution of current over the cross-sectional area of the conductor. Transmission line conductors operating with direct current do not suffer from either of these constraints. Therefore, for the same conductor losses (or heating effect), a given conductor can carry more current to the load when operating with HVDC than AC.|$|E
50|$|Although theory {{predicts that}} a {{potential}} of a little over 4 volts should be sufficient to cause the reaction to go forward, in practice potentials of up to 8 volts are used. This is done {{in order to achieve}} <b>useful</b> <b>current</b> densities in the electrolyte despite its inherent electrical resistance.

50|$|The {{rationale}} {{for this new}} method is clear. As evidenced by Rio+20 and the UN Habitat World Urban Forum in Napoli (2012) and Medellin (2014), sustainability assessment is on the global agenda. However, the more complex the problems, the less <b>useful</b> <b>current</b> sustainability assessment tools seem to be for assessing across different domains: economics, ecology, politics and culture. For example, the Triple Bottom Line approach tends to take the economy as its primary point of focus with {{the domain of the}} environmental as the key externality. Secondly, the one-dimensional quantitative basis of many such methods means that they have limited purchase on complex qualitative issues. Thirdly, the size, scope and sheer number of indicators included within many such methods means that they are often unwieldy and resist effective implementation. Fourthly, the restricted focus of current indicator sets means that they do not work across different organizational and social settings—corporations and other institutions, cities, and communities. Most indicator approaches, such as the Global Reporting Initiative or ISO14031, have been limited to large corporate organizations with easily definable legal and economic boundaries. Circles of Sustainability was developed to respond to those limitations.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a simplified zero-dimensional mathematical {{model for a}} self-humidifying proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell stack of 1  kW. The model incorporates major electric and thermodynamic variables and parameters involved {{in the operation of}} the PEM fuel cell under different operational conditions. Influence of each of these parameters and variables upon the operation and the performance of the PEM fuel cell are investigated. The mathematical equations are modeled by using Matlab–Simulink tools in order to simulate the operation of the developed model with a commercial available 1  kW horizon PEM fuel cell stack (H- 1000), which is used for the purposes of model validation and tuning of the developed model. The model can be extrapolated to higher wattage fuel cells of similar arrangements. New equation is presented to determine the impact of using air to supply the PEM fuel cell instead of pure oxygen upon the concentration losses and the output voltage when <b>useful</b> <b>current</b> is drawn from it.|$|E
40|$|Probabilistic risk {{assessment}} (PRA) provides practical techniques for predicting and managing risks (i. e., frequencies and severities of adverse consequences) in many complex engineered systems. In this chapter, we survey methods for PRA and decision-making in engineered systems, emphasizing progress in methods {{for dealing with}} uncertainties (e. g., via Bayesian belief networks, with dependencies among inputs expressed via copulas), communicating results effectively, and using them to guide improved decision-making by multiple parties (e. g., teams of stakeholders). For systems operating under threats from intelligent adversaries, novel methods (e. g., game-theoretic ideas) can help to identify effective risk-reduction strategies and resource allocations.
