We have previously responded to the technical assistance request, completing the first three tasks on April 28, 2001. This memorandum provides the information requested by Task 4, guidance for use with the Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards (NMSS) Decommissioning Standard Review Plan (NUREG- 1727). Attached is the draft version of the staff guidance {{to be used with}} NUREG- 1727 in reviewing proposed partial <b>site</b> <b>releases.</b> The draft guidance will be released to the public for comment after the proposed rule is published. NMSS approach focuses on the considerations licensees and reviewers would need to make in developing the appropriate, reasonable scenarios for the released property and reach finality for <b>site</b> <b>release,</b> in the vast amount of cases. The guidance document is divided into three sections: (1) the technical review guidance; (2) more detailed technical bases; and (3) a checklist and worksheet for staff to use to quickly limit the amount of information needed and the number of scenarios that may need more consideration. After first screening out the scenarios that are not appropriate for the situation, the licensee would need to decide, and justify, the scenarios where calculations will be performed. The primary considerations are:! How could (or does) the remaining licensed property influence the dose on the partial release 1 (e. g., effluent releases, groundwater contamination, etc.) ?

40|$|AbstractWhether contact of an axon with a {{dendrite}} is {{a necessary}} inductive signal for the assembly of functional presynaptic machinery is controversial. Combining FM 1 - 43 imaging with retrospective immunocytochemistry, we observe many functional synaptic vesicle (SV) <b>release</b> <b>sites</b> lacking postsynaptic specializations in cultured hippocampal neurons. These “orphan” <b>release</b> <b>sites</b> share the same exocytic machinery and mechanisms of endocytic recycling as mature synaptic sites. Moreover, quantitative analysis of FM 1 - 43 destaining at these orphan <b>release</b> <b>sites</b> reveals similar kinetics with slightly lower release probabilities. Time-lapse imaging of FM 1 - 43 reveals that orphans are generated by complete or partial mobilization of synaptic <b>release</b> <b>sites</b> that retain their functionality in transit. Orphan clusters fuse with existing synaptic <b>release</b> <b>sites</b> or form novel <b>release</b> <b>sites</b> onto dendrites. Mobilization and stabilization of orphan boutons to new sites of dendritic contact may represent a necessary presynaptic counterpart to postsynaptic changes observed during development and plasticity in the CNS...|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} docks of London, all built {{close to}} the City, were opened in stages by {{what was to become}} the East and West India Docks Company (E&WIDC) {{at the beginning of the}} 19th century. With the coming of the railways and increasing ship size, location {{close to the}} centre of London became less important than access to deep water, <b>unrestricted</b> <b>sites</b> and reduction in time spent travelling up the winding Thames. The Company had long been in competition with their rival, the London and St Katherine Dock Company (L&StKDC), and had been doing all it could to dominate it. The opening of the Royal Albert Dock by the L&StKDC, with its deepwater quayage, in 1880 had given access to the Thames at Gallions Reach, 11 mi by river below London Bridge and downstream of the then principal London docks. The E&WIDC were forced to retaliate.|$|R
40|$|The role of {{environmental}} olfactory information in pigeon navigation {{has been extensively}} studied by analysing vanishing bearing distributions and homing performances of homing pigeons subjected to manipulation of their olfactory perception and/or the olfactory information they were exposed to during transportation and at the <b>release</b> <b>site.</b> However, their behaviour during the homing flight remains undocumented. In this experiment we report the analysis of tracks of birds made anosmic at the <b>release</b> <b>site</b> by washing their olfactory mucosa with zinc sulfate. We thus can assess the role of local odours at the <b>release</b> <b>site</b> {{as well as the}} role {{of environmental}} odours perceived on the way, far from the <b>release</b> <b>site.</b> We observed that pigeons transported and kept at the <b>release</b> <b>site</b> in purified air and made anosmic at the <b>release</b> <b>site</b> were unable to orient towards home and were impaired at homing. By contrast, pigeons allowed to smell environmental odours during transportation and at the <b>release</b> <b>site,</b> although made anosmic prior to release, displayed unimpaired homeward orientation, but nevertheless showed impaired homing performance. These results are consistent with the view that local odours at the <b>release</b> <b>site</b> are critical for determining the direction of displacement (olfactory map) and suggest that pigeons consult the olfactory map also during their homing flight {{in order to be able}} to find their way home...|$|R
40|$|To obtain Commission {{approval}} {{to publish a}} final rule in the Federal Register to standardize the process for allowing a power reactor licensee to release part of its reactor facility or <b>site</b> for <b>unrestricted</b> use before termination of the operating license. This type of release is called a “partial <b>site</b> <b>release.</b> ” The rule maintains assurance that residual radioactivity would meet the radiological criteria for license termination even if a licensee released parts of the site before license termination. SUMMARY: The decommissioning and license termination rules of 10 CFR Parts 20 and 50 contain requirements to ensure that reactor facility decommissioning will be accomplished without undue {{impact on the public}} health and safety and the environment. The impact would arise from radioactivity remaining in structures, materials, soils, groundwater, and other media at a reactor site after the reactor license is terminated. Under current regulations, a reactor licensee may sell part of its site (i. e., obtain a partial <b>site</b> <b>release)</b> before it has applied the radiological criteria for license termination to the property (i. e., before it submits its license termination plan, or LTP). Several reactor licensees have expressed interest in selling parts of their sites before they receive approval of their LTPs. The NRC believes that partial release issues should be resolved generically. This rulemaking provides the requirements to be followed for a licensee to obtain NRC approval for a partial <b>site</b> <b>release.</b> The purpose of this rulemaking is to maintain the CONTACT: Harry S.
