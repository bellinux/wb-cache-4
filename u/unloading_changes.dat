40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{new form}} of endochronic {{constitutive}} model is presented to de-scribe the behavior of dry or drained sand, and its parameters are determined by extensive comparisons with published test data. Jump-kinematic hardening is used to guarantee that the hysteresis loops always close, yield positive en-ergy dissipation, and give an increase in tangent modulus when <b>unloading</b> <b>changes</b> to reloading. Criteria for virgin loading, unloading and reloading are formulated in terms of deviatoric work, and changes of material parameters at loading-unloading-reloading transition points are determined. Two endo-chronic units coupled in parallel are {{used to describe the}} measured response over a broad range of strain amplitude. The inelastic volume change is char-acterized so as to include both densification and dilatancy. Certain material properties are determined as functions of the void ratio. Calculations show that the lateral stress in a simple shear test quickly becomes almost equal to the vertical stress. A three-dimensional finite element analysis of the simple shear test with endochronic theory reveals significant stress nonuniformity; but this is found to have little effect on the resulting hysteresis loops...|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} studies with a hindlimb elevation model, we demonstrated that skeletal unloading transiently inhibits bone formation. This effect {{is limited to}} the unloaded bones (the normally loaded humerus does not cease growing), suggesting that local factors are of prime importance. IGF-I is one such factor; it is produced in bone and stimulates bone formation. To determine the impact of skeletal unloading on IGF-I production and function, we assessed the mRNA levels of IGF-I and its receptor (IGF-IR) in the proximal tibia and distal femur of growing rats during 2 weeks of hindlimb elevation. The mRNA levels for IGF-I and IGF-IR rose during hindlimb elevation, returning toward control values during recovery. This was accompanied by a 77 % increase in IGF-I levels in the bone, peaking at day 10 of <b>unloading.</b> <b>Changes</b> in IGF binding protein levels were not observed. Infusion of IGF-I (200 micrograms/day) during 1 week of hindlimb elevation doubled the increase in bone mass of the control animals but failed to reverse the cessation of bone growth in the hindlimb-elevated animals. We conclude that skeletal unloading induces resistance to IGF-I, which may result secondarily in increased local production of IGF-I...|$|E
40|$|Space flight {{results in}} loss of bone mass, {{especially}} in weight-bearing bones, {{a condition that}} is suggested {{to be similar to}} disuse osteoporosis. As models to elucidate the underlying mechanism, bed rest studies were performed and bone metabolism in the rat both during space flight and during hindlimb unloading was investigated. The general picture is that bone formation is decreased {{partly as a result of}} reduced osteoblast function, whereas bone resorption is unaltered or increased. This deficit in bone mass can be replaced, but the time span for restoration exceeds the period of <b>unloading.</b> <b>Changes</b> in blood flow, systemic hormones, and locally produced factors are contributing in a yet undefined way to the response of osteoblastic cells to loading. The pathway by which loading and/or gravity are transduced into biochemical signals is still unknown. In vitro studies with osteoblastic cells show that their differentiation and cell morphology are altered during space flight. Elucidation of the involved signaling pathways has only recently been started. It is hoped that as the mechanisms by which bone responds to mechanical (un) loading are further understood, this insight will influence the treatment of other etiologies of osteoporosis. status: publishe...|$|E

30|$|The bct 5 -Ge {{structure}} always forms {{around the}} center of the transformed region and almost still exists after unloading. At the same time, the majority of the mixed structure with fourfold and fivefold coordinated atoms forming under pressure stress recovers the diamond structure after load relief. The calculated stress in this region is about 6  GPa, which is much lower than the threshold stress initiating the phase transformation. Hence, it is suggested that the mixed structure mentioned previously is the distorted diamond cubic structure. The elastic deformation of this region arises on loading, and it returns back to the original diamond structure during <b>unloading.</b> The <b>change</b> in the coordination number of the atoms may comes from the inappropriate cutoff radius for calculation of the nearest neighbors.|$|R
40|$|Cells in {{microgravity}} {{are subject}} to mechanical <b>unloading</b> and <b>changes</b> to the surrounding chemical environment. How these factors jointly influence cellular function is not well understood. We can investigate their role using ground-based analogues to spaceflight, where mechanical unloading is simulated through the time-averaged nullification of gravity. The prevailing method for cellular microgravity simulation is to use fluid-filled containers called clinostats. However, conventional clinostats are not designed for temporally tracking cell response, nor are they able to establish dynamic fluid environments. To address these needs, we developed a Clinorotation Time-lapse Microscopy (CTM) system that accommodates lab-on- chip cell culture devices for visualizing time-dependent alterations to cellular behavior. For the purpose of demonstrating CTM, we present preliminary results showing time-dependent differences in cell area between human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) under modeled microgravity and normal gravity...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{analysis}} of modern concepts describing {{changes in the}} stress-and-strain state of rocks, it is revealed that the elastic energy is not fully released and residual/own stresses occur in core samples {{taken out of the}} rock massif. The paper describes a model aimed at explanation of causes for residual stresses of the type. The model is composed of two elastic elements that are subject to different states of stresses; it shows major previous stages of formation of the initial state of gravity stresses of the detrital sedimentary rock which were followed by cementation and changes of the state of stresses during unloading. Being an element of the history, the sequence of formation of the rock under the ‘loading – cementing’ pattern leads to formation of two systems of stresses in the rock elements (according to K. Terzaghi), i. e. effective stresses in the rock matrix (or groundmass) that is subject to main loading, and neutral stresses in the connate fluid that is not involved in the process. Upon hardening of the solution, the effective stresses become bound by the cementing material. Changes of the stress-and-strain state of the model in case of induced or natural unloading are analyzed on the basis of stress–strain curves that are reconstructed for the rock elements prior to unloading and compared in the same systems of coordinates, and the process of unloading is reviewed with account of the condition of their joint deformation. By applying the method of superposition of the two fields of stresses during unloading, it is possible to reveal the cause-and consequence relationship between the initial state of stresses and the occurrence of own stresses and, subsequently, to trace the self-stress state. The proposed definition ensures a ‘transparent’ representation of changes of stresses between the model’s elements during <b>unloading,</b> <b>changes</b> of the potential energy and distribution of its components after unloading, which provides an explanation of the incomplete release of the potential energy.    </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{identities of}} {{proteins}} that show disuse-related {{changes in the}} content of oxidative modification are unknown. Furthermore, it is unknown whether the global accumulation of oxidized proteins is greater in aged animals with muscle disuse. The purposes of this study are 1) to identify the exact proteins that show disuse-related changes in oxidation levels and 2) to test the hypothesis that the global accumulation of oxidized proteins with muscle disuse would be greater in aged animals. Adult and old rats were randomized into four groups: weight bearing and 3, 7, or 14 days of hindlimb unloading. Soleus muscles were harvested to investigate the protein oxidation with unloading. Slot blot, SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analyses were used to detect the accumulation of 4 -hydroxy- 2 -nonenol (HNE) - and nitrotyrosine (NT) -modified proteins. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight and tandem mass spectroscopy were used to identify modified proteins. We found that global HNE- and NT-modified proteins accumulated significantly with aging but not with muscle unloading. Two HNE and NT target proteins, four-and-a-half LIM protein 1 (FHL 1) and carbonic anhydrase III (CAIII), showed changes in the oxidation levels with muscle <b>unloading.</b> The <b>changes</b> in the oxidation levels happened to adult rats but not old rats. However, old rats had higher baseline levels of HNE-modified FHL 1.

40|$|The {{deformation}} of nanocomposites containing graphene flakes with different numbers of layers {{has been investigated}} {{with the use of}} Raman spectroscopy. It has been found that there is a shift of the 2 D band to lower wavenumber and that the rate of band shift per unit strain tends to decrease as the number of graphene layers increases. It has been demonstrated that band broadening takes place during tensile deformation for mono- and bilayer graphene but that band narrowing occurs when the number of graphene layers is more than two. It is also found that the characteristic asymmetric shape of the 2 D Raman band for the graphene with three or more layers changes to a symmetrical shape above about 0. 4 % strain and that it reverts to an asymmetric shape on <b>unloading.</b> This <b>change</b> in Raman band shape and width has been interpreted as being due to a reversible loss of Bernal stacking in the few-layer graphene during deformation. It has been shown that the elastic strain energy released from the unloading of the inner graphene layers in the few-layer material (~ 0. 2 meV/atom) is similar to the accepted value of the stacking fault energies of graphite and few layer graphene. It is further shown that this loss of Bernal stacking can be accommodated by the formation of arrays of partial dislocations and stacking faults on the basal plane. The effect of the reversible loss of Bernal stacking upon the electronic structure of few-layer graphene and the possibility of using it to modify the electronic structure of few-layer graphene are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Aims: It {{has been}} shown that {{increased}} contractile activity results in heat shock protein 72 (HSP 72) accumulation in various skeletal muscles. By contrast, there is no consensus for muscle HSP 72 response to muscle disuse for short duration (5 - 8 days). On the basis of a greater constitutive HSP 72 expression in slow-twitch muscles we tested the hypothesis that mechanical unloading for a longer period (2 weeks) would affect this phenotype to a greater extent. Secondly, we evaluated the effects of a physiological muscle heat shock protein (HSP) enhancer (endurance training) on HSP response to unloading and muscle remodelling. Methods: Adult male Wistar rats were assigned randomly to four groups: (1) sedentary weight-bearing; (2) hindlimb-unloaded (HU) via tail suspension for 2 week; (3) trained on a treadmill (6 week) and (4) trained 6 week and then HU for 2 week. Results: Unloading resulted in a preferential atrophy of slow muscles [soleus (SOL), adductor longus (AL) ] and a slow-to-fast fibre transition with no change in HSP 72 level. HSP 72 levels were significantly lower in fast muscles [extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and plantaris (PLA) ], and did not <b>change</b> with mechanical <b>unloading.</b> Endurance training was accompanied by a small (SOL) or a large (EDL, PLA) increase in HSP 72 level with no change in AL. Training-induced accumulation of HSP 72 disappeared with subsequent unloading in the SOL and PLA whereas HSP 72 content remained elevated in EDL. Conclusion: The results {{of this study indicate that}} (1) after 2 weeks of <b>unloading</b> no <b>change</b> occurred in HSP 72 protein levels of slow-twitch muscles despite a slow-to-fast fibre transition; and (2) the training-induced increase of HSP 72 content in skeletal muscles did not attenuate fibre transitio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This thesis uses a {{multidisciplinary}} approach to investigate factors affecting {{the origin and}} evolution of a rock slope failure (RSF) at Hompen (Varas) in Troms, Northern Norway. These factors include internal existing structures in the bedrock, external factors such as glacial <b>unloading,</b> and <b>changes</b> in fluid pressure affecting the RSF. The study combines bedrock geology, structural geology, geomorphology, and satellite data and dGPS measurements to analyze and classify the area. Detailed field work, analyses of field data, DEM models and aerial photos are employed to interpret the RSF. The area has been divided into two domains based on observed structures. Domain I show classical RSF morpho-structures: a major scarp striking NW-SE, lateral scarps striking NE-SW, counter scarps and transfer structures. Domain II is stable but show clear pre-rock slope failure structures, e. g. major tensile fractures, which potentially may enlarge the main RSF area. Among interpreted movement mechanism, creep occurs at present towards SSW (7 - 10 mm/year) as indicated by dGPS data. There is also clear evidence of toppling as a failure mechanism, shown by the major graben area filled with toppled rock material. The detachment surface {{is assumed to be}} of ramp-flat geometry with several sliding planes, affected by fractures working their way down to a basal detachment. The initiation of the RSF is likely linked to pre-existing fracture systems inherited from Mesozoic-Cenozoic tectonic regimes, release of stress regimes in the bedrock after de-glaciation. Other factors such as permafrost melting and water drainage may have caused changes in the pore fluid pressure in the area. Today the Hompen RSF can be classified as a complex RSF field and classifies under the deep seated gravitational slope deformations (DSGSD) ...|$|R
40|$|To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that obese children are unfit (i. e., have abnormal responses to exercise testing consistent with reduced levels of habitual physical activity), we used new analytic strategies in studies of 18 obese children performing cycle ergometry. The subjects' weight (mean±SD) was 168 ± 24 % that predicted by height, and the age range was 9 to 17 years. Size-independent measures of exercise (e. g., the ratio of oxygen uptake (vo 2) to work rate during progressive exercise and the temporal response of vo 2, carbon dioxide output (vco 2), and minute ventilation (ve) {{at the onset of}} exercise) were used. The ability to perform external mechanical work was corrected for vo 2 at <b>unloaded</b> pedaling (<b>change</b> in maximum oxygen uptake (Δvo 2 max) and in anaerobic threshold (ΔAT). On average, obese children's responses were in the normal range: Δvo 2 max, 104 ± 41 % (±SD) predicted (by age); ΔAT, 85 ± 51 %; ratio of change in ve to change in vco 2, 111 ± 21 % and ratio of change in vo 2 to change in work rate, 100 ± 24 %, but six of the obese children had values of Δvo 2 max or ΔAT that were more than 2 SD below normal. In addition, obese children did not have increased Δvo 2 max or ΔAT with age as observed in nonobese children. Although the response time of vo 2 was normal (99 ± 32 %) of predicted, those for both vco 2 and ve were prolonged. We conclude that the finding of obesity in a child is not a reliable indicator of poor fitness but that testing cardiorespiratory responses to exercise can be used to identify subjects with serious impairment and to individualize therapy. © 1990 The C.

40|$|Under certain conditions, {{the plastic}} {{extension}} {{of a sample}} subjected to a constant stress is to a good approximation proportional to the logarithm of the time. Similarly, if a sample is plastically strained and <b>unloaded,</b> there are <b>changes</b> in its length and hardness which vary logarithmically with time. For dimensional reasons, a logarithmic variation must involve a time constant τ characteristic of the process, so that the deformation is proportional to n(t/τ). Two distinct mechanisms of logarithmic creep have been proposed, the work-hardening {{of a set of}} barriers to dislocation motion, all having the same activation energy, or the progressive exhaustion of the weaker barriers in a set which has a distribution of activation energies, these energies remain constant during the process of creep. It has been suggested that the experimentally observed value of τ can be used to decide which of the two mechanisms is operative. It is shown here that the work-hardening mechanism expresses τ in terms of parameters which are not easy to estimate, while, if the exhaustion mechanism operates, the observed value of τ is determined by the experimental conditions rather than by the parameters of the dislocation mechanism. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Skeletal {{alteration}} {{in experimental}} animals induced by actual and simulated spaceflight are discussed, {{noting that the}} main factor contributing to bone loss in growing rats placed in orbit aboard Soviet Cosmos biosatellites appears to be diminished bone formation. Mechanical unloading {{is seen as the}} most obvious cause of bone loss in a state of weightlessness. Reference is made to a study by Roberts et al. (1981), which showed that osteoblast differentiation in the periodontal ligament of the maxilla was suppressed in rats flown in space. Since the maxilla lacks a weight-bearing function, this finding indicates that the skeletal alterations associated with orbital flight may be systemic rather than confined to weight-bearing bones. In addition, the skeletal response to simulated weightlessness may also be systemic (wronski and Morey, 1982). In suspended rats, the hindlimbs lost all weight-bearing functions, while the forelimbs maintained contact with the floor of the hypokinetic model. On this basis, it was to be expected that there would be different responses at the two skeletal sites if the observed abnormalities were due to mechanical <b>unloading</b> alone. The <b>changes</b> induced by simulated weightlessness in the proximal tibia and humerus, however, were generally comparable. This evidence for systemic skeletal responses has drawn attention to endocrine factors...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{talonavicular}} (TN) {{joint and}} the three subtalar (ST) joints are linked anatomically and functionally. Together they form the subtalar joint complex, where movement occurs between the calcaneopedal unit (CPU) (entire foot except the talus) and the talotibiofibular unit (talus held tightly by the ankle mortise). Many are unaware of the TN joint's dual membership: it is {{a component of the}} subtalar joint complex (talocalcaneonavicular joint) and also the transverse tarsal joint (with the calcaneal-cuboid joint). The anatomy of the articulating surfaces, movement of the CPU when <b>unloaded,</b> shifts and <b>changes</b> in CPU shape with weight bearing, application to clinical tests and X-ray interpretation, and the pathophysiology applications to pes cavovarus, pes planovalgus and congenital talipes equinovarus (club foot) will be reviewed here. The CPU concept corresponds to a horizontal segmentation of the foot. This is a useful supplement to the two other segmentation methods: frontal (hindfoot, midfoot and forefoot) and sagittal (medial and lateral columns). This horizontal segmentation solves the issues with the ST joint complex, which straddles the hindfoot and midfoot, and also the issues with the dual membership of the TN joint. This concept makes it easier to understand foot deformities, better interpret the clinical and radiological signs and deduce logical treatments...|$|R
40|$|To {{define the}} {{physiologic}} role of beta 1 integrin in bone formation and mechanical loading, transgenic mice were generated by expressing the cytoplasmic tall and transmembrane domain of Beta 1 integrin {{under the control}} of the osteocalcin promoter. In cultured cells, this truncated fragment of Beta 1 can act as a dominant negative. Previously, the matrix of calvariae was shown to be abnormal in transgenic (TG) compared to wildtype (WT) mice. In this study, we analyzed appendicular bone in TG and WT, male and female mice at 14, 35, 63, 90 and 365 days old (n= 8 - 12 /gp). To assess beta 1 integrin function in mechanical loading, a pilot study using hindlimb unloading by tail suspension was performed. 35 d old TG and WT females were hindlimb unloaded for 4 wks (n= 3 - 5). Body mass, bone mineral content, histomorphometric (distal femur) and biomechanical parameters were analyzed. Statistical significance (P less than. 05) was defined by ANOVA using the Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test. We confirmed transgene expression by immunoprecipitating then immunoblotting bone lysates using an antibody against the beta 1 tail. Body masses of TG mice at 63, 90 and 365 d old were greater (16 - 25 %) than WT. Some TG female mice at 365 d appeared obese; mean abdominal fat mass was 415 % greater in TG than WT mice. Tibiae were longer (5 - 7 %) in TG than WT mice at 63 and 90 d. Tibial mineral mass of 35 d males was 7 % lower in TG than WT mice, but at 63 d was 21 % higher. The % osteoblast surface in 35 d TG mice was 20 % higher than WT, and at 63 d was 17 % lower, while % osteoclast surface did not differ. In 365 d mice, cancellous bone volume (125 %) and endocortical mineral apposition rate (40 %) were greater in TG than WT males but not females. In WT mice, hindlimb unloading caused a reduction in mineral mass of tibiae (- 20 %) and lumbar vertebrae (- 22 %) relative to normally loaded controls. Surprisingly, hindlimb unloading also caused a relative reduction (- 13 %) in humerus mass. The effects of hindlimb unloading on tibia and humerus mass were less obvious in TG than in WT mice. Since hindlimb <b>unloading</b> caused skeletal <b>changes</b> in both loaded and <b>unloaded</b> bones, systemic <b>changes</b> may contribute to bone responses observed using this animal model. In conclusion, transgene expression resulted in marked metabolic changes during growth and in the aged female.

Methods and Results—By use of quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, mRNA expression analyses were performed on left ventricular specimens obtained from 10 nonfailing donor hearts (from 8 {{patients with}} dilated cardiomyopathy and 2 patients with coronary heart disease) {{at the time of}} VAD implantation and 36 to 169 days later during VAD removal with subsequent cardiac transplantation. In terminally failing hearts before VAD support, left ventricular mRNA analyses revealed increased Pro-ANP, reduced antiapoptotic Bcl-xL and antiapoptotic Fas isoform FasExo 6 Del, and a decreased ratio of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 21 -ATPase per sarcolemmal Na 1 -Ca 21 exchanger in comparison with nonfailing ventricles. After VAD unloading, ventricular transcription of Pro-ANP was immediately normalized, and apoptotic DNA fragmentation was attenuated. In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, mRNAs of Bcl-xL and FasExo 6 Del/Fas were enhanced depending on time on VAD. The Bcl-xL mRNA level correlated positively with that of the Bcl-xL protein.

40|$|Background: Body weight {{supported}} locomotor training {{was shown to}} improve walking function in neurological patients and is often performed on a treadmill. However, walking on a treadmill does not mimic natural walking for several reasons: absent self-initiation, less active retraction of leg required and altered afferent input. The superiority of overground training has been suggested in humans and was shown in rats demonstrating greater plasticity especially in descending pathways compared to treadmill training. We therefore developed a body weight support system allowing unrestricted overground walking with minimal interfering forces to train neurological patients. The present study investigated the influence of different amounts of body weight support on gait in healthy individuals. Methods: Kinematic and electromyographic data of 19 healthy individuals were recorded during overground walking {{at different levels of}} body weight support (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 %). Upper body inclination, lower body joint angles and multi-joint coordination as well as time-distance parameters were calculated. Continuous data were analyzed with regard to distinct changes within a gait cycle across all unloading conditions. Results: Temporal gait parameters were most sensitive to <b>changes</b> in body <b>unloading</b> while spatial variables (step length, joint angles) showed modest responses when unloaded by as much as 50 % body weight. The activation of the gastrocnemius muscle showed a gradual decrease with increasing unloading while the biceps femoris muscle showed increased activity levels at 50 % <b>unloading.</b> These <b>changes</b> occurred during stance phase while swing phase activity remained unaltered. Conclusions: Healthy individuals were able to keep their walking kinematics strikingly constant even when unloaded by half of their body weight, suggesting that the weight support system permits a physiological gait pattern. However, maintaining a given walking speed using close-to-normal kinematics while being unloaded was achieved by adapting muscle activity patterns. Interestingly, the required propulsion to maintain speed was not achieved by means of increased gastrocnemius activity at push-off, but rather through elevated biceps femoris activity while retracting the leg during stance phase. It remains to be investigated to what extent neurological patients with gait disorders are able to adapt their gait pattern in response to body unloading. </p...|$|R
40|$|Cardiac {{work is a}} major {{determinant}} of heart size and growth. Heterotopic cardiac isografts are hemodynamically unloaded and undergo atrophy. To determine the molecular changes that occur as a result of hemodynamic unloading, we have studied the rate of synthesis of total cardiac proteins and myosin heavy chain (MHC) and the expression of the myosin heavy chain gene as reflected in the messenger RNA levels for alpha- and beta-MHC isoforms. 72 h after transplantation there is a significant decrease in left ventricular size accompanied by a 27 % decrease in the rate of total cardiac protein synthesis and a 53 % decrease in the rate of myosin heavy chain synthesis. In contrast to isografts 14 d after transplantation which have a decrease in protein synthetic capacity, simultaneous measurements of 18 S ribosomal RNA and myosin messenger RNA suggest that after 3 d the decrease in synthesis is due to a change in the efficiency of protein translation. While the working in situ heart expresses primarily alpha-MHC mRNA (97 %) hemodynamic unloading leads to a 43 % decrease in alpha-MHC mRNA concentration and the de novo expression of the beta-MHC mRNA. Total MHC mRNA (alpha plus beta) concentration analyzed by a quantitative S 1 nuclease protection assay was similar in the two groups of hearts. Thus, in association with hemodynamic <b>unloading</b> there are <b>changes</b> in cardiac myosin heavy chain content as a result of both gene transcription and protein translation mechanisms...|$|R

Both steels were tested in the as-processed condition and after many years of service in electric power plants. The test temperature was 540 degrees C and test durations ranged from a few days to a year. In 1 / 2 Cr- 1 / 2 Mo- 1 / 4 V steel, crack growth occured intergranularly by grain boundary cavitation, while 2 1 / 4 Cr- 1 Mo steel also exhibited transgranular growth. The deformation behavior of CT specimens was analyzed in detail. It was found that for typically 20 % of the lifetime, the instantaneous elastic-plastic strains and, primary creep determine the deformation response. The evolution of the crack length parallels that of the load-line deflection: Initially, the crack grows relatively fast, decelerates until a steady growth rate is reached, and finally accelerates due to the increasing stress intensity at the longer crack. This behavior can be described reasonably accurately by models for creep crack growth taking into account the elastic-plastic transient and primary creep. It is demonstrated that the Ct parameter correlates crack growth rates during the transients, whereas C integral becomes the appropriate load parameter during steady-state creep. However, C integral fails to describe crack growth in single-edge notched tension specimens with shallow cracks. This is tentatively ascribed to excessive crack-tip blunting and other geometry <b>changes.</b> <b>Unloading</b> and reloading frequently leads to accelerated crack growth. (IWM...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, lots of {{research}} effort {{was spent on}} the integration of process planning and job-shop scheduling. Various integrated process planning and scheduling (IPPS) models and solution approaches have been proposed. The previous and existing research approaches are able to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing IPPS. However, most of them assumed that setup time is negligible or {{only part of the}} processing time. For machined parts, the setup for each operation includes workpiece loading and <b>unloading,</b> tool <b>change,</b> etc. For setup that depends only on the operation to be processed (sequence-independent), it is applicable to adopt the assumption of not considering setup in IPPS. For setup that depends on both the operation to be processed and the immediately preceding operation (sequence-dependent), it is an oversimplification to adopt such assumption. In such cases, the setup time varies with the sequence of the operations. The process plans and schedules constructed under such assumption are not realistic or not even feasible. In actual practice, therefore, the setup time should be separated from the process time in performing the IPPS functions. In this thesis, a new approach is proposed for IPPS problems with setup time consideration for machined parts. Inseparable and sequence-dependent setup requirements are added into the IPPS problems. The setup times are separated from the process times and they vary with the sequence of the operations. IPPS is regarded as NP-hard problem. With the separated consideration of setup times, it becomes even more complicated. An Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) approach is proposed to handle this complicated problem. The system is constructed under a multi-agent system (MAS). AND/OR graph is used to record the set of feasible production procedures and sequences. The ACO algorithm computes results by an autocatalytic process with the objective to minimize the makespan. Software agents called “artificial ants” traverse through the feasible routes in the graph and finally construct a schedule. A setup time parameter is added into the algorithm to influence the ants to select the process with less setup time. The approach is able to construct a feasible solution with less setup time. Experimental studies have been performed to evaluate the performance of MAS-ACO approach in solving IPPS problems with separated consideration of setup times. The experimental results show that the MAS-ACO approach can effectively handle the problem. published_or_final_versionIndustrial and Manufacturing Systems EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{mechanical}} load variation triggers {{a wide range}} of responses in the heart, a part of which includes cellular remodelling. Over the past 15 years, evidence has amassed that a part of this remodelling process involves changes to a sophisticated structure in the cell membrane, called the transverse (t) -tubule system. The t-tubules are a series of regular membrane invaginations, which contain a high density of ion channels responsible for local Ca 2 + induced Ca 2 + release (CICR). This thesis addresses {{the question of whether the}} t-tubule system can be said to be specifically load sensitive, the nature of that load sensitivity and its molecular regulators. Using surgical models, the influence of {{mechanical load}} variation of different durations, degrees and settings are studied. Local CICR and t-tubule structure are investigated. First, it was found that prolonged mechanical <b>unloading</b> induces subtle <b>changes</b> to the t-tubule system, which functionally uncouples the Ryanodine receptors (RyR) and L-type Ca 2 + channels (LTCC) and induces a loss of whole cell Ca 2 + release synchrony. Second, heart failure was found to be associated with loss of t-tubule structure and Ca 2 + handling abnormalities. Following mechanical unloading, the t-tubule system recovered with enhanced LTCC-RyR uncoupling, resulting in improved Ca 2 + handling. Third, the t-tubules were found to be unchanged initially during graded mechanical load variation. Prolonged myocardial unloading or overloading impaired t-tubule structure, with loss of normal CICR. Telethonin (Tcap), a member of the cardiomyocyte stretch sensing complex, is a candidate regulator of the t-tubules. In a Tcap knock-out (KO), cardiomyocytes show a primary t-tubule defect, which becomes more pronounced following mechanical overload.

However, {{little is known}} about the changes in the detailed structures of the entire tendinous tissue and whether the change in tendon stiffness is related to morphology. We investigated changes in dimensional (volume, cross-sectional area, segmented lengths) and elastic (Young's modulus) properties of the Achilles tendon and distal aponeurosis in response to chronic unilateral lower limb suspension (ULLS) using velocity encoded phase contrast (VE-PC) and three-dimensional morphometric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Five healthy subjects underwent ULLS for 4 wk. Axial morphometric MRI was acquired along the entire length from the calcaneous to the medial gastrocnemius insertion. An oblique sagittal VE-PC MRI was also acquired. The Young's modulus could be calculated from this cine dynamic sequence of velocity encoded images from the slope of the stress-strain curve during the submaximal isometric plantar flexion. After 4 wk of ULLS, we found significant (46. 7 %) decrease in maximum plantar flexion torque. The total volumes of entire tendinous tissue (determined as the sum of the Achilles tendon and distal aponeurosis) increased significantly by 6. 4 % (11. 9 vs. 12. 7 ml) after ULLS. In contrast, Young's modulus decreased significantly by 10. 4 % (211. 7 vs. 189. 6 MPa) for the Achilles tendon and 29. 0 % for the distal aponeurosis (158. 8 vs. 113. 0 MPa) following ULLS. There was no significant correlation between relative change in volume and Young's modulus with 4 wk of ULLS. It is suggested that, although tendon hypertrophy can be expected to adversely affect tendon stiffness, the absence of any significant correlation between the magnitude of tendon hypertrophy and reduced Young's modulus indicates that dimensional factors were not critical to the elastic properties...|$|R

Sports Physiol., Vol. 10, No. 1 pp. 25 - 30, 2004. The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{investigate}} flexible neurophysilogical mechanisms of anticipatory postural adjustment (APA) during ballistic arm movement in standing human subjects. To reveal the mechanisms, we recorded EMG discharges of postural muscles and the soleous H-reflexes (Sol-H) before, during and after ballistic arm movement with or without a load (loaded or unloaded) to the moving wrist joint. The present results were as follows; 1) Preceding EMG durations of the ipsilaterak biceps femoris (BFi) muscle at the unloaded were significantly longer than those at the loaded, whereas three other time phases (EMG duration of BFi, tome difference between EMG onset of left and right BF muscles, and duration of soleus EMG silence) at the loaded were always longer than those at the <b>unloaded,</b> 2) Excitability <b>changes</b> of Sol-H on the time curse at the loaded or the unloaded were dependent upon EMG discharge patterns of the soleus muscke i. e., depression of Sol-H at the unloaded was langer than that at the loaded, but duration of Sol-H depression on the time course was longer at the loaded than that at the unloaded, and 3) Movement initiation of the ipsilateral knee joint at the unloaded was earlier and larger than that at the loaded. These results confirmed the previous suggestion, i. e., the mechanism of APA is a flexible. In addition, to be more concrete, these results lead {{to the conclusion that the}} regulation of the stretch reflex threshold and the muscle stiffness are essential ncural mechanisms of APA...|$|R
40|$|Glaciation is {{considered}} one of the main natural processes that can have a significant impact on the long term performance of DGRs. The northern part of the American continent has been subjected to a series of strong glaciation and deglaciation events over the past million years. Glacial cycles cause loading and <b>unloading,</b> temperature <b>changes</b> and hydraulic head changes at the ground surface. These changes can be classified as transient boundary conditions. It is widely accepted that the periodic pattern of past glacial cycles during the Late Quaternary period are resultant of the Earth’s orbital geometry changes that is expected to continue in the future. Therefore, from the safety perspective of DGRs, such probable events need to be taken into account. The objective of this thesis is to develop a numerical model to investigate the thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) coupled processes that have resulted from long term past and future climate changes and glaciation cycles on a proposed DGR in sedimentary rocks in southern Ontario. The first application is done on a large geological cross section that includes the entire Michigan basin by using a hydro-mechanical (HM) coupled process. The results are compared with field data of anomalous pore water pressures from deep boreholes in sedimentary rocks of southern Ontario. In this work. The modeling results seem to support the hypothesis that at least the underpressures in the Ordovician formation could be partially attributed to past glaciation. The second application is made on site conditions by using the THMC model. The results for the pore water pressure, tracer profiles, permafrost depth and effective stress profile are compared with the available field data, the results show that the solute transport in the natural limestone and shale barrier formations is controlled by diffusion, which provide evidence that the main mechanism of transport at depth is diffusion-dominant. The third application is made on site conditions to determine the effect of underground changes in DGRs due to DGR construction. The results show that future glaciation loads will induce larger increases in effective stresses on the shaft. Furthermore, it is found that hypothetical nuclide transport in a failed shaft can be controlled by diffusion and advection. The simulation results show that the solute transported in a failed shaft can reach the shallow bedrock groundwater zone. These results might imply that a failed shaft will substantially lose its effectiveness as a barrier. The fourth application is proposed to investigate the geochemical evolution of sedimentary host rock in a near field scale. In this part, a new thermo-hydro-mechanical-geochemical simulator (COMSOL-PHREEQC) is developed. It is anticipated that there will be a geochemical reaction within the host rock that results from interaction with the water enriched with the CO 2 generated by nuclear waste...|$|R
40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is {{the most}} common joint {{disorder}} worldwide, causing joint pain and stiffness. The current gold standard for diagnosing knee OA is radiography. However, the disease has often progressed well beyond {{the point of no return}} once radiographic cartilage changes become visible. Identifying changes in cartilage at an early stage of OA would allow curative or prophylactic treatment to be instigated much earlier than today. Early in the progression of the disease, the articular cartilage is depleted of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which are responsible for cartilage load distribution and compressive stiffness. Delayed gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of cartilage, abbreviated dGEMRIC, can be used to estimate the GAG content of cartilage. A contrast medium is used, the concentration of which in the cartilage is inversely proportional to the amount of GAG. The purpose of this work was to evaluate dGEMRIC as a prognostic tool for knee cartilage changes and knee OA in humans. It was found that dGEMRIC could be used to predict the development of radiographic knee OA in patients at risk of developing OA. An association was also found between dGEMRIC values and important features of knee OA, such as joint space narrowing and osteophytes (bony <b>changes).</b> <b>Unloading</b> of joints has previously been shown to affect the constituents of cartilage. The knees of patients with ankle fractures, prescribed unloading of the injured leg for six weeks, were investigated. Unloading resulted in a measurable effect on the constituents of the knee cartilage, seen as a decrease in GAG content and an increase in the range of dGEMRIC values. These findings should be taken into account when considering treatment of patients involving an unloading regimen. Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury has previously been shown to be an important risk factor for the development of OA. Patients who had sustained an ACL injury 20 years earlier, who had not undergone ACL reconstruction, were investigated. Notably, these patients showed good cartilage quality and subjective knee function, similar to that in healthy reference groups. This is an important finding and should be considered when recommending treatment for patients with ACL injuries...|$|R
40|$|Computerized Dynamic Posturography has {{recently}} provided {{a means of}} objectively measuring balance and postural stability. Using this technology to compare pre-injured data with post-injury data can aid athletic trainers in monitoring the assessment of balance while determining when to return an athlete to participation. The purpose {{of this research is}} to determine if balance measurements are influenced by injury and the rate at which balance is restored as the athlete is returned to play. A qualitative design was conducted using a case study format. Seven female Division I soccer athletes served as subjects. All subjects experienced lower extremity injuries during the competitive season and were returned to play during that same season. Subjects 2 ̆ 7 balance, postural sway, and stability were measured in spring using the Neurocom® Smart Balance Master. These measurements included Sensory Organization Test, Motor Control Test (MCT), and Adaptation Test (ADT). Once injured the subjects were measured: (1) {{as soon as they were}} able to bear weight on the affected leg; (2) once they were cleared to return to play; and (3) 2 weeks after they had returned to play. The measurements were compared to the baseline testing and also to each other in order to determine changes in balance throughout the rehabilitation and return to play process. Compared to the athlete 2 ̆ 7 s baseline data, post-injury data showed weight symmetry <b>changes</b> (<b>unloading</b> involved limb), increased latency scores during the ADT, and ankle/hip dominance shifting toward hip preference. As the rehabilitation process continued, most of the variables that had been disrupted migrated toward a return to pre-injury baseline. Two weeks after the subjects had been cleared to return to participation the majority of balance variables were either equal to or greater than baseline. Athletic trainers need to consider many factors when determining when an athlete should be cleared to participate following an injury. Balance and postural stability are important factors in decreasing re-injury as well as improving overall performance. Utilizing new technologies that provide more objective information on balance gives the clinicians more information to help them make return-to-play decisions...|$|R
