5000|$|The number {{series of}} machine screws has been {{extended}} downward to include #00-90 (0.047 in = 0.060 in − 0.013 in) and #000-120 (0.034 in = 0.060 in − 2 × 0.013 in) screws; however, the main standard for screws smaller than #0 is ANSI/ASME standard B1.10 <b>Unified</b> Miniature <b>Screw</b> Threads. This defines a series of metric screws named after their major diameters in millimetres, from 0.30 UNM to 1.40 UNM. Preferred sizes are 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 and 1.2 mm, with additional defined sizes halfway between. The standard thread pitch is approximately [...] of the major diameter. The thread form is slightly modified to increase the minor diameter, and thus the strength of screws and taps. The major diameter still extends to within H of the theoretical sharp V, but the total depth of the thread is reduced 4% from H = [...] cos(30°) P ≈ 0.541P to 0.52P.

30|$|Unifying {{the models}} for {{topology}} design and kinematic analysis {{has long been}} a desire for the research of parallel kinematic machines (PKMs). This requires that analytical description, formulation and operation for both finite and instantaneous motions are performed by the same mathematical tool. Based upon finite and instantaneous <b>screw</b> theory, a <b>unified</b> and systematic approach for topology design and kinematic analysis of PKMs is proposed in this paper. Using the derivative mapping between finite and instantaneous screws built in the authors’ previous work, the finite and instantaneous motions of PKMs are analytically described by the simple and non-redundant screws in quasi-vector and vector forms. And topological and parametric models of PKMs are algebraically formulated and related. These related topological and parametric models are ready to do type synthesis and kinematic analysis of PKMs under the <b>unified</b> framework of <b>screw</b> theory. In order to show the validity of the proposed approach, a kind of two-translational and three-rotational (2 T 3 R) 5 -axis PKMs is taken as example. Numerous new structures of the 2 T 3 R PKMs are synthesized as the results of topology design, and their Jacobian matrix is obtained easily for parameter optimization and performance evaluation. Some of the synthesized PKMs have outstanding capabilities in terms of large workspaces and flexible orientations, and have great potential for industrial applications of machining and manufacture. Among them, METROM PKM is a typical example which has attracted a lot of attention from global companies and already been developed as commercial products. The approach is a general and unified approach {{that can be used in}} the innovative design of different kinds of PKMs.|$|R
