5|$|The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for {{minerals}} in 2001. For manganese {{there was}} not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs, so needs are described as estimates for Adequate Intakes (AIs). The current AIs for manganese for women and men ages 19 and <b>up</b> <b>are</b> 1.8 and 2.3 mg/day, respectively. AI for pregnancy is 2.0 mg/day. AI for lactation is 2.6 μg/day. For children ages 1–18 years the AI increases with age from 1.2 to 2.2 mg/day for males, to 1.6 mg/day for females. As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of manganese the adult UL is set at 11 mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs {{are referred to as}} Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) Manganese deficiency is rare.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Dyson swarm, the {{constructs}} making it <b>up</b> <b>are</b> not {{in orbit around}} the star, but would be statites—satellites suspended by use of enormous light sails using radiation pressure to counteract the star's pull of gravity. Such constructs {{would not be in}} danger of collision or of eclipsing one another; they would be totally stationary with regard to the star, and independent of one another. Because the ratio of radiation pressure to the force of gravity from a star is constant regardless of the distance (provided the statite has an unobstructed line-of-sight to the surface of its star), such statites could also vary their distance from their central star.|$|E

25|$|Many {{adventure}} games {{make use}} of an inventory management screen as a distinct gameplay mode. Players are only {{able to pick up}} some objects in the game, so the player usually knows that only objects that can be picked <b>up</b> <b>are</b> important. Because it can be difficult for a player to know if they missed an important item, they will often scour every scene for items. For games that utilize a point and click device, players will sometimes engage in a systematic search known as a pixel hunt. Games try to avoid this by highlighting the item, or by snapping the player's cursor to the item.|$|E
25|$|Two {{models that}} have been {{designed}} for military use from the ground <b>up</b> <b>are</b> the 101 Forward Control from the early 1970s and the Lightweight or Airportable from the late 1960s.

Originally RAFMRS Land Rovers had blue bodies and bright yellow tops, to be better seen from above. In 1981, the colour scheme was changed to green with yellow stripes.

25|$|The immortal souls {{that follow}} the gods most closely {{are able to}} just barely raise their chariots up to the rim and look out on reality. They see some things and miss others, {{having to deal with}} their horses; they rise and fall at varying times. Other souls, while {{straining}} to keep <b>up,</b> <b>are</b> unable to rise, and in noisy, sweaty discord they leave uninitiated, not having seen reality. Where they go after is then dependent on their own opinions, rather than the truth. Any soul that catches sight of any true thing is granted another circuit where it can see more; eventually, all souls fall back to earth. Those that have been initiated are put into varying human incarnations, depending on how much they have seen; those made into philosophers have seen the most, while kings, statesmen, doctors, prophets, poets, manual laborers, sophists, and tyrants follow respectively.|$|E
25|$|Accelerators are {{a form of}} selection-based search {{which allow}} a user to invoke an online service from any other page using only the mouse. Actions such as {{selecting}} the text or other objects will give users access to the usable Accelerator services (such as blogging with the selected text, or viewing a map of a selected geographical location), which can then be invoked with the selected object. According to Microsoft, Accelerators eliminate the need to copy and paste content between web pages. IE8 specifies an XML-based encoding which allows a web application or web service to be invoked as an Accelerator service. How the service will be invoked and for what categories of content it will show <b>up</b> <b>are</b> specified in the XML file. Similarities have been drawn between Accelerators and the controversial Smart tags feature experimented with in the IE 6 Beta but withdrawn after criticism (though later included in MS Office).|$|E
25|$|Grazers {{as well as}} browsers, the chital mainly feed on grasses {{throughout}} the year.

Browse forms a major portion of the diet only in the winter months-October to January-when the grasses, tall or dried <b>up,</b> <b>are</b> no more palatable. Browse includes herbs, shrubs, foliage, fruits and forbs; Moghania species are often preferred while browsing. Fruits eaten by chital in the Kanha National Park (Madhya Pradesh, India) include those of Ficus species from January to May, Cordia myxa from May to June, Syzygium cumini from June to July. Individuals tend to group together and forage while moving slowly. Chital are generally silent when grazing together. Males often stand on their hindlegs to reach tall branches. Water holes are visited nearly twice daily, with great caution. In the Kanha National Park, mineral licks rich in calcium and phosphorus pentoxide were scraped at by the incisors. Chital in the Sunderbans may be omnivores; remains of red crabs have been found in the rumen of individuals.|$|E
