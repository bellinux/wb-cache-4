2500|$|Many {{flowering}} plants use the pigment phytochrome to sense seasonal changes in day length, which they take as signals to flower. This sensitivity to day length is termed photoperiodism. Broadly speaking, {{flowering plants}} {{can be classified}} as long day plants, short day plants, or day neutral plants, depending on their particular response to changes in day length. [...] Long day plants require a certain minimum length of daylight to starts flowering, so these plants flower in the spring or summer. Conversely, short day plants flower when the length of daylight falls below a certain critical level. Day neutral plants do not initiate flowering based on photoperiodism, though some may <b>use</b> <b>temperature</b> sensitivity (vernalization) instead.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We propose an {{encoding}} method of numerical data in DNA <b>using</b> <b>temperature</b> gradient. We introduce melting temperature (Tm) for this purpose. Melting temperature {{is a unique}} characteristic to manipulate the hybridization and denaturation processes that used in the key steps in DNA computing such as the solution generation step and the amplification step. DNA strands of lower melting temperature tend to denature with ease and also be easily amplified by slightly modified polymerase chain reaction, called denaturation temperature gradient polymerase chain reaction. Using these properties, we implement a local search molecular algorithm <b>using</b> <b>temperature</b> gradient, which is contrasted to conventional exhaustive search molecular algorithms. The proposed methods are verified by solving an instance of the travelling salesman problem. We could effectively amplify the correct solution and the <b>use</b> of <b>temperature</b> gradient made the detection of solutions easier. ...|$|R
