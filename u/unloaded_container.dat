30|$|The {{type of wagon}} {{which is}} used depends on the {{technical}} equipment that is available for the <b>unloading</b> of <b>containers</b> at the destination sidings. Larger sidings are generally equipped with specific loading equipment to load and <b>unload</b> the <b>containers.</b> These sidings can be served with container wagons. On the other hand, smaller sidings often only have forklifts or industrial trucks available to <b>unload</b> <b>containers.</b> These vehicles need a continuous floor to operate on the wagon. Therefore, these sidings can only be served by conventional flat wagons.|$|R

50|$|Both {{maritime}} and {{inland container}} terminals usually provide storage facilities for both loaded and empty containers. Loaded containers are stored for relatively short periods, whilst waiting for onward transportation, whilst <b>unloaded</b> <b>containers</b> may be stored {{for longer periods}} awaiting their next use. Containers are normally stacked for storage, and the resulting stores are known as container stacks.|$|R
50|$|Mid-stream {{operation}} involves {{loading and}} <b>unloading</b> <b>containers</b> {{to and from}} ships while at sea, with barges or dumb steel lighters performing the transfer, and then distributing or landing the containers to piers nearby.

40|$|With growing {{worldwide}} trade, {{container terminals}} {{have grown in}} number and size. Many new terminals are now automated to increase operational efficiency. The key focus is on improving seaside processes, where a distinction can be made between single quay crane operations (all quay cranes are either loading or <b>unloading</b> <b>containers)</b> and overlapping quay crane operations (some quay cranes are loading while others are <b>unloading</b> <b>containers).</b> From existing studies, {{it is not clear}} if the design insights obtained from analyzing single operations, such as optimal stack layout, are consistent with the insights obtained from analyzing overlapping operations. In this paper, we develop new integrated stochastic models for analyzing the performance of overlapping loading and unloading operations that capture the complex stochastic interactions among quayside, vehicle, and stackside processes. Using these integrated models, we are able to show that that there are stack layout configurations that are robust for both single (either loading or unloading) and for overlapping (both loading and unloading) operations...|$|R
50|$|The berth {{allocation}} problem (also {{known as}} the berth scheduling problem) is a NP-complete problem in operations research, regarding the allocation of berth space for vessels in container terminals. Vessels arrive over time and the terminal operator needs to assign them to berths to be served (loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>containers)</b> as soon as possible. Different factors affect the berth and time assignment of each vessel.|$|R

30|$|During the (un)loading of a containership, two {{criteria}} are important: the ship’s stability {{and the number}} of unproductive moves (Imai et al. 2006). During (un)loading, the ship’s stability changes {{as a result of the}} continuously changing container load. Because containerships visit several container terminals, each time <b>unloading</b> <b>containers</b> from and loading containers onto the ship, not all containers that have to be unloaded are positioned on top of the ship’s stacks. Ships therefore have to be loaded in an efficient way, allowing the next <b>container</b> terminal to <b>unload</b> the containership with a minimum of unproductive moves.|$|R

A standard sidelifter is also able to stack a container at a two containers' height on the ground. If the sidelifter chassis is of 40' length or more, the cranes of the sidelifter can be shifted hydraulically along the sidelifter chassis to be able to pick up either one 20', one 40', or two 20' ISO containers at a time.|$|R

40|$|A {{solution}} {{to the problems of}} resource allocation and scheduling of loading and unloading operations in a container terminal is presented. The two problems are formulated and solved hierarchically. First, the solution of the resource allocation problem returns, over a number of work shifts, a set of quay cranes used to load and <b>unload</b> <b>containers</b> from the moored ships and the set of yard cranes to store those containers on the yard. Then, a scheduling problem is formulated to compute the loading and <b>unloading</b> lists of <b>containers</b> for each allocated crane. The feasibility of the solution is verified against a detailed, discrete-event based, simulation model of the terminal. The simulation results show that the optimized resource allocation, which reduces the costs by 1 / 3, can be effectively adopted in combination with the optimized loading and unloading list. Moreover, the simulation shows that the optimized lists reduce the number of crane conflicts on the yard and the average length of the truck queues in the terminal...|$|R
