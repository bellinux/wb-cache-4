The titanium nitride layers exhibit a rich variety of elastic contrast in the <b>ultrasonic</b> force <b>microscopy</b> images.

However, so far all reported solutions has limited bandwidth under 135 MHz. We present a solution for <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>microscopy</b> that is capable of dealing with coded GHz signals. The ultrasound microscope features a high frequency arbitrary signal source, a solid state switch, a microcontroller trigger device, and a preamplifier. Our signal source based on quadrature I-Q modulator modulates a high frequency signal with low frequency arbitrary signals and produces a high frequency arbitrary signal. This signal source gives more than 200 MHz bandwidth in center frequency range of 0. 2 - 1 GHz {{that can be used for}} coded signals. For pulse echo operation we use commercial 3 GHz solid state switches that handle 15 Vpp signals and that are controlled by an Atmel microcontroller. The preamplifier is a custom built low noise preamplifier (3. 3 dB noise figure) with broadband, 0. 01 - 1. 2 GHz. Originally the components was developed for wireless networking. We performed electric tests on our devices with several signals whose frequency range was 0. 1 - 1. 1 GHz. We also validated our device with a custom built ultrasound immersion microscope by imaging a 5 µm tall MEMS step structure using 100 - 300 MHz, 3 µs, 10. 5 Vpp linear and non-linear chirp excitation.

The method employs an ultrasonic wave launched {{from the bottom of}} a sample while the cantilever of an atomic force microscope engages the sample top surface. The cantilever is driven at a frequency differing from the ultrasonic frequency by one of the contact resonance frequencies of the cantilever. The nonlinear mixing of the oscillating cantilever and the ultrasonic wave at the sample surface generates difference-frequency oscillations at the cantilever contact resonance. The resonance-enhanced difference-frequency signals are used to create amplitude and phase-generated images of nanoscale near-surface and subsurface features.

40|$|Inducible {{defenses}} are common strategies {{for coping with}} the selective force of predation in heterogeneous environments. In recent years the conspicuous and often dramatic morphological plasticity of several waterflea species of the genus Daphnia {{have been found to}} be inducible defenses activated by chemical cues released by predators. However, the exact defensive mechanisms remained mysterious. Because even some minute morphological alterations proved to be protective against predatory invertebrates, it has been suggested that the visible morphological changes are only the tip of the iceberg of the entire protective mechanisms. Here we applied a method of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>microscopy</b> with vector contrast at 1. 2 GHz to probe hidden morphological defenses. We found that induction with predator kairomones increases the stability of the carapace in two Daphnia species up to 350 %. This morphological plasticity provides a major advantage for the induced morphs during predation because predatory invertebrates need to crush or puncture the carapace of their prey to consume them. Our ultrastructural analyses revealed that the internal architecture of the carapace ensures maximal rigidity with minimal material investment. Our results uncover hidden morphological plasticity and suggest a reconsideration of former classification systems in defended and undefended genotypes in Daphnia and possibly in other prey organisms as well...|$|E

40|$|Recently a flat lens for elastic Lamb waves {{displaying}} negative refraction {{and focusing}} {{has been demonstrated}} experimentally {{for the first time}} [1]. In the present paper we investigate this phenomenon numerically by using an adapted version of the 3 -D Elastodynamic Finite Integration Technique (EFIT), a highly efficient, explicit time-domain solver for elastodynamics. We study refraction of Lamb waves by a plane interface consisting of an abrupt thickness change between two different plate regions. While one region supports a backward-propagating (negative group velocity) mode the other plate region supports a forwardpropagating (positive group velocity) mode at exactly the same frequency and wave number. We demonstrate negative refraction and focusing numerically and compare it with the experimental results from [1]. The investigated plate system represents a surprisingly simple mechanical system which exhibits negative group velocity behavior in a certain frequency ba nd and thus provides a powerful test bed for negative-index physics. Moreover, by using this phenomenon a "perfect" lens approach according to Veselago should be possible. Due to the relative simplicity of the system and the well-understood behavior of ultrasonic Lamb waves the approach offers high potential for practical NDE applications, e. g. for the development of near-field lenses for <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>microscopy...</b>|$|E

The interaction is modeled as a nonlinear spring coupled at opposite ends to linear springs representing cantilever and sample surface oscillators. The model leads to a pair of coupled nonlinear differential equations that are solved analytically using a standard iteration procedure. Solutions are obtained for the phase and amplitude signals generated by various acoustic-atomic force microscope (A-AFM) techniques including force modulation microscopy, atomic force acoustic microscopy, ultrasonic force microscopy, heterodyne force microscopy, resonant difference-frequency atomic force <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>microscopy</b> (RDF-AFUM), and the commonly used intermittent contact mode (TappingMode) generally available on AFMs. The solutions are used to obtain a quantitative measure of image contrast resulting from variations in the Young modulus of the sample for the amplitude and phase images generated by the A-AFM techniques. Application of the model to RDF-AFUM and intermittent soft contact phase images of LaRC-cp 2 polyimide polymer is discussed. The model predicts variations in the Young modulus of the material of 24 percent from the RDF-AFUM image and 18 percent from the intermittent soft contact image.
