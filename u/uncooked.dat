5|$|Antioxidant {{vitamins}} {{are found}} in vegetables, fruits, eggs, legumes and nuts. Vitamins A, C, and E can be destroyed by long-term storage or prolonged cooking. The effects of cooking and food processing are complex, as these processes can also increase the bioavailability of antioxidants, such as some carotenoids in vegetables. Processed food contains fewer antioxidant vitamins than fresh and <b>uncooked</b> foods, as preparation exposes food to heat and oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Avocado cake can be {{prepared}} as an <b>uncooked</b> cake using raw avocados and other raw ingredients, which are blended together into a smooth consistency and then chilled. A food processor {{can be used to}} blend the ingredients. Raw avocado cake prepared with a significant amount of avocado may contain substantial amounts of vitamin E and essential fatty acids, which are derived from avocado.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, New Jersey {{state health}} {{department}} investigators from Trenton were dispatched to study the possibility {{for an increase in}} typhoid fever in flooded areas. In Woodbury, where the city pumping station was flooded, water was rationed. Gas service was also limited in Woodbury, Pedricktown, Penns Grove. As a result of a gas plant becoming inundated in Glassboro, electricity was rationalized in Hammonton, forcing residents to eat <b>uncooked</b> food. Police were forced to transport residents of Mount Holly to work via boat due to the high floodwaters.|$|E
5|$|Avocado cake is a cake {{prepared}} using avocado as {{a primary}} ingredient, together with other typical cake ingredients. The avocados can be mashed, and {{may be used as}} an ingredient in cake batter, in cake toppings and alone atop a cake. Cake variations include raw avocado cake, avocado brownies and avocado cheesecake. Raw, <b>uncooked</b> versions of avocado cake can be high in vitamin E and essential fatty acids, which are derived from avocado. Avocado-based cake toppings include avocado fool and avocado crazy.|$|E
5|$|Tempoyak {{refers to}} {{fermented}} durian, usually made from lower quality durian unsuitable for direct consumption. Tempoyak can be eaten either cooked or <b>uncooked,</b> is normally eaten with rice, {{and can also}} be used for making curry. Sambal Tempoyak is a Sumatran dish made from the fermented durian fruit, coconut milk, and a collection of spicy ingredients known as sambal. In Palembang, Pangasius catfish can be either cooked as tempoyak ikan patin (fish in tempoyak curry) or as brengkes (pepes) tempoyak, which is a steamed fermented durian paste in banana leaf container.|$|E
5|$|Beef steaks are {{commonly}} grilled, broiled or occasionally fried. Grilled beef steaks can be cooked at different temperatures, or for different lengths of time; the resulting cooked steak ranges from blue (very rare) to overdone. The most common {{characteristics of a}} rare steak is a soft, cold, red center. The outside is seared for flavor, while the inside is cooked to suit the diner's preference. Steaks cooked well-done are typically cooked throughout the entire cut of meat. For example, a beefsteak cooked well-done will not have any pinkness in the middle when sliced. <b>Uncooked</b> beef steak can be served raw, such as in steak tartare.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} linked to {{outbreaks}} of some food-borne illnesses, including Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum. The latter toxin has been traced to pre-made, packaged coleslaw mixes, while the spores were found on whole cabbages that were otherwise acceptable in appearance. Shigella species are able to survive in shredded cabbage. Two outbreaks of E.coli in the United States have been linked to cabbage consumption. Biological risk assessments have concluded that there is the potential for further outbreaks linked to <b>uncooked</b> cabbage, due to contamination at many stages of the growing, harvesting and packaging processes. Contaminants from water, humans, animals and soil have the potential to be transferred to cabbage, and from there to the end consumer.|$|E
5|$|The North {{is known}} for its often crumbly cheeses, of which Cheshire cheese is the {{earliest}} example. Unlike Southern cheeses like Cheddar, Northern cheeses typically use <b>uncooked</b> milk and a pre-salted curd pressed under enormous weights, resulting in a moist, sharp-tasting cheese. Wensleydale, another crumbly cheese, is unusual in that it is often served as a side to sweet cakes, which are themselves well represented in Northern England. Parkin, an oatmeal cake with black treacle and ginger, is a traditional treat across the North on Bonfire Night, and the fruity scone-like singing hinny and fat rascal are popular in the North East and Yorkshire respectively.|$|E
5|$|In Thailand, durian {{is often}} eaten fresh with sweet sticky rice, and blocks of durian paste {{are sold in}} the markets, though much of the paste is {{adulterated}} with pumpkin. Unripe durians may be cooked as a vegetable, except in the Philippines, where all uses are sweet rather than savoury. Malaysians make both sugared and salted preserves from durian. When durian is minced with salt, onions and vinegar, it is called boder. The durian seeds, which are the size of chestnuts, can be eaten whether they are boiled, roasted or fried in coconut oil, with a texture {{that is similar to}} taro or yam, but stickier. In Java, the seeds are sliced thin and cooked with sugar as a confection. <b>Uncooked</b> durian seeds are potentially toxic due to cyclopropene fatty acids and should not be ingested.|$|E
5|$|The {{biology is}} poorly known; {{the male and}} female {{reproductive}} castes were described {{for the first time in}} 2012. The genus is known mainly from isolated workers found in Winkler or Berlese samples. Tatuidris workers have peculiar mandibular brushes and a powerful sting, which led Brown & Kempf to speculate that Tatuidris might be specialist predators of active or slippery arthropod prey. Until 2011, no observations of live specimens were registered. Details of a first collection event of a small live colony (3 workers and 4 gynes) by Thibaut Delsinne in a mid-elevation forest in southeastern Ecuador suggest that Tatuidris may well be a highly specialized predator, as colonies kept in captivity did not accept any food item offered to them. Food items rejected by the ants included live and dead termites, millipedes, mites, various insect parts, sugar water, tuna, biscuits, live and dead fruit flies (Drosophila), live springtails, live myriapods (Chilopoda and Diplopoda), live and dead Diplura, small live spiders, small live pseudoscorpions, one small snail, <b>uncooked</b> hen egg (i.e. piece of cotton wool soaked with fresh whisked hen egg), ant larvae (Gnamptogenys sp.), and live ant workers (Cyphomyrmex sp., Brachymyrmex sp.). Potential food items (arthropods) for Tatuidris were taken from soil samples and Winkler samples collected at the site where Tatuidris was a priori determined to be present.|$|E
25|$|Raw feeding is the {{practice}} of feeding domestic dogs, cats and other carnivores a diet primarily of <b>uncooked</b> meat, edible bones, and organs.|$|E
25|$|Wild herbs were {{collected}} and were eaten <b>uncooked</b> or cooked. These {{are known to}} have included garden rocket and mallow and both leaf chicory and endive.|$|E
25|$|Ingestion of yeast, {{for example}} in <b>uncooked</b> bread dough, can cause {{intestinal}} obstruction. The yeast can also cause fermentation internally, resulting in ethanol (alcohol) poisoning.|$|E
25|$|Raw veganism {{includes}} only {{fresh and}} <b>uncooked</b> fruit, nuts, seeds, and vegetables. Vegetables {{can only be}} cooked {{up to a certain}} temperature, for instance using a dehydrator.|$|E
25|$|Sandhill crane Grus canadensis (qucillgaq sg qucillgaak dual qucillgaat pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, qucilkuryug in Cup'ig). Needle (kakuun) {{made from}} the front part of an <b>uncooked</b> crane’s foot.|$|E
25|$|<b>Uncooked</b> bracken {{contains}} the enzyme thiaminase, which breaks down thiamine. Eating excessive quantities of bracken can cause beriberi, especially in creatures with simple stomachs. Ruminants are less vulnerable because they synthesize thiamine.|$|E
25|$|Along with papain, {{bromelain}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular proteases to use for meat tenderizing. Bromelain is sold in a powdered form, which is combined with a marinade, or directly sprinkled on the <b>uncooked</b> meat.|$|E
25|$|Thilashins {{observe the}} ten precepts {{and can be}} {{recognised}} by their pink robes, shaven head, orange or brown shawl and metal alms bowl. Thilashins go out on alms rounds on uposatha and receive <b>uncooked</b> rice or money.|$|E
25|$|Cooked food {{included}} {{soups and}} stews {{that were a}} mixture of meat and vegetables. Beans and lentils were {{likely to have been}} cooked several times a week. However, vegetables, such as squash, garlic, leek and onions were also eaten <b>uncooked.</b>|$|E
25|$|Raw {{foie gras}} can be roasted, sauteed, pan-seared (poêlé) or (with care and attention), grilled. As foie gras has high fat content, contact with heat {{needs to be}} brief and {{therefore}} at high temperature, lest it burn or melt. Optimal structural integrity for searing requires the foie gras to be cut to a thickness between 15 and 25mm (½ – 1inch), resulting in a rare, <b>uncooked</b> center. Some chefs prefer not to devein the foie gras, as the veins can help preserve {{the integrity of the}} fatty liver. It is increasingly common to sear the foie gras on one side only, leaving the other side <b>uncooked.</b> Practitioners of molecular gastronomy such as Heston Blumenthal of The Fat Duck restaurant first flash-freeze foie gras in liquid nitrogen as part of the preparation process.|$|E
25|$|Schickele's works {{attributed}} to P. D. Q. Bach often incorporate comical rearrangements of well-known works of other composers. The works use instruments not normally used in orchestras, {{such as the}} bagpipes, slide whistle, kazoo, and fictional or experimental instruments such as the pastaphone (made of <b>uncooked</b> manicotti), tromboon, hardart, lasso d'amore, and left-handed sewer flute.|$|E
25|$|Ethiopian Jews were {{forbidden}} to eat the food of non-Jews. A Kahən eats only meat he has slaughtered himself, which his hosts prepare both for him and themselves. Beta Israel who broke these taboos were ostracized and had to undergo a purification process. Purification included fasting for one or more days, eating only <b>uncooked</b> chickpeas provided by the Kahən, and ritual purification before entering the village.|$|E
25|$|Food-borne {{botulism}} {{results from}} contaminated food in which C. botulinum spores {{have been allowed}} to germinate in low-oxygen conditions. This typically occurs in home-canned food substances and fermented <b>uncooked</b> dishes. Given that multiple people often consume food from the same source, it is common for more than a single person to be affected simultaneously. Symptoms usually appear 12–36 hours after eating, but can also appear within 2 hours to 10 days.|$|E
25|$|Folic acid food {{fortification}} became mandatory in Canada in 1998, with the fortification of 150µg of folic acid per 100grams of enriched flour and <b>uncooked</b> cereal grains. The purpose of fortification was {{to decrease the}} risk of neural tube defects in newborns. It is important to fortify grains {{because it is a}} widely eaten food and the neural tube closes in the first four weeks of gestation, often before many women even know they are pregnant.|$|E
25|$|Leeks, {{onions and}} garlic were eaten both cooked in stews, and <b>uncooked</b> with bread, and their {{popularity}} may be indicated by the observation in the Bible that {{they are among the}} foods that the Israelites yearned for after leaving Egypt. Squash and melons were eaten raw, or flavored with vinegar. Black radishes were also eaten raw when in season during the autumn and winter. The Talmud mentions the use of radish seeds to produce oil, and considered eating radishes to have health benefits.|$|E
25|$|Raw, yellow, sweet maize kernels are {{composed}} of 76% water, 19% carbohydrates, 3% protein, and 1% fat (table). In a 100-gram serving, maize kernels provide 86 calories and are a good source (10-19% of the Daily Value) of the B vitamins, thiamin, niacin, pantothenic acid (B5) and folate (right table for raw, <b>uncooked</b> kernels, USDA Nutrient Database). In moderate amounts, they also supply dietary fiber and the essential minerals, magnesium and phosphorus whereas other nutrients are in low amounts (table).|$|E
25|$|Food in {{the camps}} was {{extremely}} scarce, consisting of rice with no additions. As the prisoners lacked pots and the rice they received was <b>uncooked,</b> it was indigestible; horses and oxen that died in the camp were later distributed to the inmates as food. Dysentery and lung diseases were common. Despite those conditions, the Herero were taken outside the camp every day for labour under harsh treatment by the German guards, while the sick were left without any medical assistance or nursing care.|$|E
25|$|Another {{study from}} Zhejiang University {{examined}} the nutritional value of broccoli after five common cooking techniques; steaming, boiling, microwaving, stir-frying and stir-frying followed by deep frying. The {{study found that}} the two most common methods of home cooking in China, stir-frying and stir-frying combined with deep frying in soybean oil, resulted in a much greater loss of chlorophyll, soluble protein, soluble sugar and vitamin C. The method which affected these values the least was steaming. Stir frying for five minutes and stir frying combined with boiling caused the highest loss of glucosinolates which according to this study are best preserved by steaming. A study performed by the Spanish National Research Counsel stir fried the broccoli for only 3 minutes 30 seconds and found that nutritional value of these broccoli samples varied depending on which cooking oil was used. Comparing these results to an <b>uncooked</b> sample, the study found that phenolics and vitamin C were reduced more than glucosinolates and minerals. Stir-frying with soybean, peanut, safflower or extra virgin olive did not reduce glucosinolates, and broccoli stir-fried with extra virgin olive oil or sunflower oil had vitamin C levels similar to <b>uncooked</b> broccoli. These levels were significantly lower with other edible oils.|$|E
25|$|In the shtetls of Europe, {{religious}} {{neighborhoods in}} Jerusalem {{and other cities}} in Israel {{before the advent of}} electricity and cooking gas, a pot with the assembled but <b>uncooked</b> ingredients was brought to the local baker before sunset on Fridays. The baker would put the pot with the cholent mixture in his oven, which was always kept fired, and families would come by to pick up their cooked cholent on Saturday mornings. The same practice was observed in Morocco, where black pots of s’hina (see Variations below) placed overnight in bakers’ ovens and then delivered by bakers’ assistants to households on Shabbat morning.|$|E
25|$|The {{most celebrated}} of these dances is the karakattam. In its {{religious}} form, the dance is performed {{in front of}} an image of the goddess Mariamman. The dancer bears on his or her head a brass pot filled with <b>uncooked</b> rice, decorated with flowers and surrounded by a bamboo frame, and tumbles and leaps to the rhythm of a song without spilling a grain. Karakattam is usually performed to a special type of song known as temmanguppāṭṭu a folk song in the mode of a lover speaking to his beloved, to the accompaniment of a nadaswaram and melam.|$|E
25|$|Australian Labor Party leader Kim Beazley {{continued}} to oppose {{it during the}} Howard government's second term. During the 2001 election campaign, Labor made a 'GST rollback' a centrepiece of its election platform. Labor attempted to reprise {{the effects of the}} birthday cake interview by deriding the application of GST to cooked and <b>uncooked</b> chickens, but failed to ignite public response to the limited scope of the rollbacks applying only to gas and electricity bills. Labor lost the election, and though the 11 September attacks and the so-called Tampa affair dominated the campaign, the loss would effectively end all serious opposition to the GST.|$|E
25|$|Tepcuaraq (tepcuar(aq) or tepcuaraq kumlaneq) is {{fish that}} has been frozen after being allowed to age slightly, eaten <b>uncooked</b> and frozen. Kumlaneq is aged spawned out salmon. Tepcuaraq kumlaneq is aged and frozen fish. The whole fish can be either cleaned of their {{entrails}} or left intact, then buried under ground in a pit lined with grass and left {{for about a week}} depending on the temperature. If the fish are caught in the late fall, they are stored in a wooden or cardboard box until they are aged, and then frozen. Tepcuaraq kumlaneq are eaten frozen with seal oil.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} world records in egg-and-spoon racing are held by New-Yorker and serial record-holder Ashrita Furman; these include, as {{published}} by Guinness World Records, fastest 100 m egg-and-spoon race (19.39 seconds); fastest 100 m egg-and-spoon race while holding the spoon in the mouth (25.13 seconds); fastest mile egg-and-spoon race (7 minutes, 8 seconds); fastest mile egg-and-spoon race holding the spoon with both hands (8 minutes, 5 seconds); and fastest mile egg-and-spoon race holding the spoon in the mouth (9 minutes, 29 seconds). In 1990 a runner completed the London Marathon in three hours forty-seven minutes while carrying a dessert spoon with an <b>uncooked</b> egg balanced upon it.|$|E
25|$|Korean cuisine uses a {{wide variety}} of {{vegetables}}, which are often served <b>uncooked,</b> either in salads or pickles, as well as cooked in various stews, stir-fried dishes, and other hot dishes. Commonly used vegetables include Korean radish, napa cabbage, cucumber, potato, sweet potato, spinach, bean sprouts, scallions, garlic, chili peppers, seaweed, zucchini, mushrooms and lotus root. Several types of wild greens, known collectively as chwinamul (such as Aster scaber), are a popular dish, and other wild vegetables such as bracken fern shoots (gosari) or Korean bellflower root (doraji) are also harvested and eaten in season. Medicinal herbs, such as ginseng, reishi, wolfberry, Codonopsis pilosula, and Angelica sinensis, are often used as ingredients in cooking, as in samgyetang.|$|E
25|$|Common {{ostriches}} {{have been}} farmed in South Africa {{since the beginning}} of the 19th century. According to Frank G. Carpenter, the English are credited with first taming common ostriches outside Cape Town. Farmers captured baby common ostriches and raised them successfully on their property, and were able to obtain a crop of feathers every seven to eight months instead of killing wild common ostriches for their feathers. It is claimed that common ostriches produce the strongest commercial leather. Common ostrich meat tastes similar to lean beef and is low in fat and cholesterol, as well as high in calcium, protein and iron. <b>Uncooked,</b> it is dark red or cherry red, a little darker than beef. Ostrich stew is a dish prepared using common ostrich meat.|$|E
25|$|The {{storage of}} pasta {{depends on how}} far along it is processed. <b>Uncooked</b> pasta is kept dry and can sit in the {{cupboard}} for a year if airtight and stored in a cool, dry area. Cooked pasta is stored {{in the refrigerator for}} a maximum of five days in an airtight container. Adding a couple teaspoons of oil helps keep the food from sticking to itself and the container. If the cooked pasta is not used in the five days it may be frozen for up to two or three months. The pasta will start to dry after a period of time, but it varies with the type of pasta. Should the pasta be dried completely, it can be placed back in the cupboard.|$|E
