40|$|The Flight Management Computer (FMC) and its interface, the Multi-function Control and Display Unit (MCDU) {{have been}} {{identified}} by researchers and airlines as difficult to train and use. Specifically, airline pilots have described the "drinking from the fire-hose" effect during training. Previous research has identified memorized action sequences as {{a major factor in}} a <b>user</b> <b>s</b> <b>ability</b> to learn and operate complex devices. This paper discusses the use of a method to examine the quantity of memorized action sequences required to perform a sample of 102 tasks, using features of the Boeing 777 Flight Management Computer Interface. The analysis identified a large number of memorized action sequences that must be learned during training and then recalled during line operations. Seventy-five percent of the tasks examined require recall of at least one memorized action sequence. Forty-five percent of the tasks require recall of a memorized action sequence and occur infrequently. The large number of memorized action sequences may provide an explanation for the difficulties in training and usage of the automation. Based on these findings, implications for training and the design of new user-interfaces are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Additive Manufacturing (AM) refers {{to the use of}} a group of technologies capable of combining material layer-by-layer to manufacture geometrically complex products in a single digitally controlled process step, entirely without moulds, dies or other tooling. AM is a parallel manufacturing approach, allowing the contemporaneous production of multiple, potentially unrelated, components or products. This thesis contributes {{to the understanding of the}} economic aspects of additive technology usage through an analysis of the effect of AM s parallel nature on economic and environmental performance measurement. Further, this work assesses AM s ability to efficiently create complex components or products. To do so, this thesis applies a methodology for the quantitative analysis of the shape complexity of AM output. Moreover, this thesis develops and applies a methodology for the combined estimation of build time, process energy flows and financial costs. A key challenge met by this estimation technique is that results are derived on the basis of technically efficient AM operation. Results indicate that, at least for the technology variant Electron Beam Melting, shape complexity may be realised at zero marginal energy consumption and cost. Further, the combined estimator of build time, energy consumption and cost suggests that AM process efficiency is independent of production volume. Rather, this thesis argues that the key to efficient AM operation lies in the <b>user</b> <b>s</b> <b>ability</b> to exhaust the available build space...|$|E

As the main tools of NGO approach is the group based credit, the examination of NGOs developmental role would be incomplete if it did not include an examination of the socio-cultural attitudes of the communities towards repayment and their perception of the role of lending agencies.

As the poor are mostly defined as income poor NGOs have come forward with credit service to their clients. And the groups ensure the payments of weekly installments. As credit operation has become the main business of the NGOs in Bangladesh, they may have to keep their original mission aside to be in the market. So while running the credit program or commercial business NGOs should be concerned with the mission, why they have been evolved. If the new circumstances compel them to take different ways of running the affairs, it has to make clear to it stakeholders or they can change their mission statement. So, keeping the organizational mission upheld in the competitive world is important capacity of NGOs. Therefore keeping this in mind NGOs have to learn to be in the development field without sacrificing their primary mission or goal. To serve interest of the poor the NGOs need to acquire capabilities in order to devise and uphold a clear organizational mission. The clarity of a mission statement can help an organization to become a learning organization and build social capital, effectively manage programs and introduce voluntarism as an organizational value. In the absence of these features NGOs sustainability may be at stake. In Bangladesh NGOs offer alternative development models. It is very crucial that NGOs work with commitment in order to attain the mentioned capabilities. Bangladesh {{has a high}} density in NGO population.

40|$|The conical-domain {{model is}} a {{computational}} model, now undergoing development, for estimating ionospheric delays of Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Relative to the standard ionospheric delay model described below, the conical-domain model offers improved accuracy. In the absence of selective availability, the ionosphere is the largest source of error for single-frequency users of GPS. Because ionospheric signal delays contribute to errors in GPS position and time measurements, satellite-based augmentation systems (SBASs) {{have been designed to}} estimate these delays and broadcast corrections. Several national and international SBASs are currently in various stages of development to enhance the integrity and accuracy of GPS measurements for airline navigation. In the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) of the United States, slant ionospheric delay errors and confidence bounds are derived from estimates of vertical ionospheric delay modeled on a grid at regularly spaced intervals of latitude and longitude. The estimate of vertical delay at each ionospheric grid point (IGP) is calculated from a planar fit of neighboring slant delay measurements, projected to vertical using a standard, thin-shell model of the ionosphere. Interpolation on the WAAS grid enables estimation of the vertical delay at the ionospheric pierce point (IPP) corresponding to any arbitrary measurement of a user. (The IPP of a given <b>user</b> <b>s</b> measurement is the point where the GPS signal ray path intersects a reference ionospheric height.) The product of the interpolated value and the <b>user</b> <b>s</b> thin-shell obliquity factor provides an estimate of the <b>user</b> <b>s</b> ionospheric slant delay. Two types of error that restrict the accuracy of the thin-shell model are absent in the conical domain model: (1) error due to the implicit assumption that the electron density is independent of the azimuthal angle at the IPP and (2) error arising from the slant-to-vertical conversion. At low latitudes or at mid-latitudes under disturbed conditions, the accuracy of SBAS systems based upon the thin-shell model suffers due to the presence of complex ionospheric structure, high delay values, and large electron density gradients. Interpolation on the vertical delay grid serves as an additional source of delay error. The conical-domain model permits direct computation of the <b>user</b> <b>s</b> slant delay estimate without the intervening use of a vertical delay grid. The key is to restrict each fit of GPS measurements to a spatial domain encompassing signals from only one satellite. The conical domain model is so named because each fit involves a group of GPS receivers that all receive signals from the same GPS satellite (see figure); the receiver and satellite positions define a cone, the satellite position being the vertex. A user within a given cone evaluates the delay to the satellite directly, using (1) the IPP coordinates of the line of sight to the satellite and (2) broadcast fit parameters associated with the cone. The conical-domain model partly resembles the thin-shell model in that both models reduce an inherently four-dimensional problem to two dimensions. However, unlike the thin-shell model, the conical domain model does not involve any potentially erroneous simplifying assumptions about the structure of the ionosphere. In the conical domain model, the initially four-dimensional problem becomes truly two-dimensional in the sense that once a satellite location has been specified, any signal path emanating from a satellite can be identified by only two coordinates; for example, the IPP coordinates. As a consequence, a <b>user</b> <b>s</b> slant-delay estimate converges to the correct value in the limit that the receivers converge to the <b>user</b> <b>s</b> location (or, equivalently, in the limit that the measurement IPPs converge to the <b>user</b> <b>s</b> IPP) ...|$|R
