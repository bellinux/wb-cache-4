25|$|In {{this species}} {{the color of}} the shell is very variable. The {{background}} color can be whitish to greenish yellow, and the shell often has darker coloured bands or spots. The ventral side of the shell frequently has two brown bands, and is whitish between the lowest band and the <b>umbilicus.</b> The shell has 4-4.5 whorls. The last whorl descends abruptly below the periphery of the shell. The apertural margin is white, and is reflected (turned back)in adult shells, in juveniles this is true only on the columellar side. The <b>umbilicus</b> is narrow and open in juveniles, only partly covered by the reflected columellar margin,; the <b>umbilicus</b> is however completely closed in adult shells.|$|E
25|$|The {{shell is}} sinistral, subglobose, subdiscoidal, hyaline and very thin. The spire is {{depressed}} {{but it can}} be considered rather high in comparison of other Limacina species. The shell has 5-6 transversally striated whorls. The suture is distinct. The last whorl is large and with very obscure keel next to its <b>umbilicus.</b> The shell has a wide <b>umbilicus.</b> The aperture is higher than it is wide.|$|E

50|$|Members of the Adrianitidae, {{named by}} Schindewolf in 1931, {{and of the}} Adrianitaceae, have shells (conchs) that are {{discoidal}} to globular with <b>umbilici</b> that vary in form, and sutures with 10 to 30, more or less equal, lobes.|$|R
50|$|Adrianitaceae {{is one of}} {{seventeen}} superfamilies currently included in the Goniatitina, but only one of six there included in the Treatise, 1957. Shells are subdiscoidal to globose with variable <b>umbilici</b> and sutures with 10 to 30 lobes, {{which tend to be}} subequal.|$|R
25|$|The vitelline vessels remnant {{that connects}} the {{diverticulum}} to the <b>umbilicus</b> may form a fibrous or twisting band (volvulus), trapping the small intestine and causing obstruction. Localised periumbilical pain may be experienced in the right lower quadrant (like appendicitis).|$|E
25|$|Traditional open {{surgery is}} usually {{performed}} through a ventral midline incision below the <b>umbilicus.</b> The incision size varies {{depending upon the}} surgeon {{and the size of}} the animal.

25|$|A {{breech birth}} is {{the birth of}} a baby from a breech presentation, in which the baby exits the pelvis with the {{buttocks}} or feet first as opposed to the normal head-first presentation. In breech presentation, fetal heart sounds are heard just above the <b>umbilicus.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Phyllocertina {{comprise}} a suborder of ammonoid cephalopods, {{belonging to the}} Ammonitida, whose range extends from the Lower Triassic to the Upper Cretaceous. Shells of the Phylloceratina are generally smooth with small to large <b>umbilici</b> and complex sutures with leaf-like phylloid saddle endings and lobes with thorn-like projections.|$|R
5000|$|Goniatitoidea [...] {{formerly}} Goniatitaceae {{in older}} publications, is a superfamily of late Paleozoic ammonoid cephalopods {{included in the}} Goniatitida. They are characterized by thinly discoidal to globular shells with variable <b>umbilici</b> and sculpture. The ventral lobe, located along the outer margin, is prominently bifurcated (two pronged); the lateral lobe undivided.|$|R
5000|$|Thalassoceratoidea, {{formerly}} Thalassocerataceae, is a superfamily of Late Paleozoic ammonites {{characterized by}} their thick-discoidal to subglobular, involute shells with narrow or closed <b>umbilici</b> and biconvex growth striae with ventral sinuses. The ventral lobe of the suture, which straddles the outer rim, is wide, and bifid, {{with a tall}} median saddle.|$|R
25|$|The shell can {{be found}} in various colour variants, but is {{basically}} yellow or white with dark color bands or spots and often a dark bluish grey apex. The shells of juveniles are sharply keeled, however the keel is not present on the final adult whorl. The aperture often has a lip that is light reddish on the inside, and the lip margin is only reflected at columellar side. The <b>umbilicus</b> is narrow and half covered by the reflected columellar margin. The apex has a characteristic size in the eastern Mediterranean when compared with other species, where there are no other Theba species. The <b>umbilicus</b> is also rarely seen in other species. Juveniles of Eobania vermiculata have a considerably larger apex.|$|E
25|$|They have mistaken his {{unbridled}} vitality for insubordination; {{his native}} talent for pig iron; his abuse {{of beauty and}} pictorial authenticity for rebellious babble, and his refusal {{to sit in a}} rut like a melancholy and brooding Buddha, contemplating his <b>umbilicus,</b> as a downright menace.|$|E
25|$|The {{shell is}} creamy white to light brownish, often with indistinct brown colour bands. The shell has {{five to six}} whorls. The {{aperture}} is large. The apertural margin is white and slightly reflected in adult snails. The <b>umbilicus</b> is narrow and partly covered by the reflected columellar margin.|$|E
50|$|Goniatitinae {{is one of}} six subfamilies {{into which}} the Goniatitidae is {{subdivided}} according to Miller, Furnish, and Schindewolf, 1957. The diagnostic character is the narrow bifurcated (double pronged) ventral lobe of the suture, which lies along the outer rim. As with the inclusive Goniatitidae, sutures have eight lobes, shells are without prominent ornament, <b>umbilici</b> are small to moderate in size.|$|R
5000|$|The Posttornoceratidae are Late Devonian goniatites (Ammonoidea) {{included}} in the superfamily Tornocerataceae. The Family, Posttornoceratidae, named by Bogoslovsky in 1962, {{is based on the}} genus Posttornoceras, named by Wedekind in 1910, originally {{included in}} the Tornoceratidae (sensu Miller et al. 1964). [...] The Posttornoceratidae produced subglobular to discoidal shells with small, closed <b>umbilici</b> and lateral lobes in the suture that are produced adentitiously (i.e. haphazardly) from the first lateral saddles.|$|R
5000|$|The Prolecanitaceae {{combines}} {{two related}} families, the ancestral Prolecanitidae and the derived Daraelitidae. A third family, the Prodromitidae has been abandoned and its sole genus, Prodromites {{included in the}} Prolecanitidae. These two families differ primarily in {{the complexity of the}} suture which is simpler and goniatitic in the Prodromitidae and more complex and ceratitic in the Daraelitidae. The Prolecanitaceae are distinguished from the Medlicottiacea primarily by their rounded rather than flat or grooved vente and large as opposed to small <b>umbilici.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{shell is}} bullate, fairly thick, white, spirally striate, with a {{well-developed}} periostracum. There is no spire and no <b>umbilicus.</b> The columella {{is smooth and}} simple. The aperture extends for the whole length of the shell, and is narrower above than below. The apertural lip extends upwards beyond {{the apex of the}} shell.|$|E
25|$|The apex (prev.vertex) is {{directed}} forward toward {{the upper part}} of the pubic symphysis, and from there the median umbilical ligament continues upward on the back of the anterior abdominal wall to the <b>umbilicus.</b> The peritoneum is carried by it from the apex on to the abdominal wall to form the middle umbilical fold.|$|E
25|$|The {{shape of}} the shell is valvatiform. The shell is {{thin-walled}} and glossy. The shell has 2–2.5 rapidly but regularly growing whorls. The spire is low or very low. The <b>umbilicus</b> is very wide, with the earlier whorls visible inside. The teleoconch is very finely sculptured with weakly marked growth lines. The protoconch has about 1¼ whorls growing slowly; {{the border between the}} proto- and teleoconch is indistinct; the protoconch surface is nodular.|$|E
50|$|Thalassoceratids are {{characterized}} by thick-discoidal to subglobular, involute shells with narrow or closed <b>umbilici</b> and serrate or digitate external lobes in the suture. This latter distinguishes them from the Bisatoceratidae in which the external lobes are smooth. The ventral lobe is extremely wide; the height of median saddle may exceed half {{the height of the}} entire ventral lobe itself. Some forms have ventrolateral grooves but spiral ornamentation is absent. Miller, Funish, and Schindewolf, 1957, in the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology Part L included Thalassoceras, Eothalassoceras, Delepinoceas, Gleboceras, Epithalassoceras. Saunders, Work, and Nikolaeva, 1999, included Eothalassoceras, Prothalassoceras, Gleboceras, Aistoceras, Thalassoceras, Epithalassoceras, Aristoceratoides. In the revised Treatise (W.M. Furnish et al. 2009) the Thalassoceratidae is divided into two subfamilies, the Gleboceratinae which includes Gleboceras and Mapesites and the Thalssoceratinae which includes Aristoceras, Aristoceratoides, Eothalassoceras, Epithalassoceras, Prothalassoceras, and Thalassoceras.|$|R
40|$|Oogenesis in four {{commercial}} Caribbean sponge species, Hippospongia lachne, Spongia barbara, S. cheiris and S. graminea, was studied using {{light and}} transmission electron microscopy. Eggs and embryos develop asynchronously in localized endosomal nurseries of these viviparous and gonochoristic species. Statistical analyses of specific morphological characteristics of reproductive elements have unequivocally identified four specific {{stages in the}} process of oogenesis. Oogonia undergo mitotic division to produce primary oocytes. Meiotic division occurs producing secondary oocytes which are fertilized before zygotes undergo major growth by phagocytosis and the transfer of nutrients through cytoplasmic bridges. During cleavage of the zygote, <b>umbilici</b> form between embryos and nurse cell layers and these function in the transfer of symbiotic bacteria and other mesohyl substances from the maternal parent to the embryo. These symbionts were observed dispersed between blastomeres of all young and maturing embryos and between internal cells of cytodifferentiated parenchymella larvae. Extracellular transfer of symbiotic bacteria from maternal tissues to developing embryos has not been reported in any other viviparous invertebrate...|$|R
40|$|On September 27 th, 2012 a 3 -week old Holstein {{heifer calf}} {{presented}} to the Cornell University Equine and Farm Animal Hospital for an approximately one week history of coughing, decreased appetite, diarrhea, and fever. This calf was one of six, high genetic value, in vitro fertilization (IVF) calves on the farm showing similar signs. All calves were unresponsive to multiple antimicrobials. On arrival, a resulting physical and thoracic ultrasound examination yielded a problem list including fever, diarrhea, and respiratory disease. In addition, other calves had swollen joints and <b>umbilici.</b> A subsequent diagnostic plan revealed several infectious agents present on the farm. Due {{to the nature of}} the case, an Animal Health Diagnostic Center (AHDC) Extension Veterinarian conducted an interview of the herd veterinarian and performed a herd visitation. Key herd management issues were identified. As a result, recommendations were made to increase passive transfer in animals, improve housing and feed management, and create working standard operating procedures...|$|R
