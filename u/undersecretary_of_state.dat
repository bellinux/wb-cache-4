5|$|In November 1997, Robin Raphel was {{appointed}} as United States Ambassador to Tunisia. Tunisia {{was a frequent}} partner for Mediterranean military exercises with U.S. naval squadrons and marine battalions, allowing more exercises in its waters {{than any other country}} in North Africa. When Raphel was ambassador, Stuart Eizenstat, the <b>Undersecretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> for Economics, Business and Agriculture, proposed a new initiative to liberalize trade further with Tunisia. The Eizenstat Initiative, as it came to be known informally, implemented lower tariffs on industrial and manufacturing sector goods to enable Tunisia to become a supplier for goods throughout Arab and African states.

5|$|Several {{figures in}} Eisenhower's administration, {{including}} Secretary of State John Foster Dulles {{and his brother}} CIA Director Allen Dulles, had {{close ties to the}} United Fruit Company. The Dulles brothers had worked for the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell, and in that capacity had arranged several deals for the UFC. <b>Undersecretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> Walter Bedell Smith would later become a director of the company, while the wife of the UFC public relations director was Eisenhower's personal assistant. These personal connections meant that the Eisenhower administration tended to conflate the interests of the UFC with that of U.S. national security interests, and made it more willing to overthrow the Guatemalan government. The success of the 1953 CIA operation to overthrow the democratically elected Prime Minister of Iran also strengthened Eisenhower's belief in using the agency to effect political change overseas.|$|E
5|$|Árbenz's {{enactment}} of Decree 900 in 1952 provoked Truman to authorize Operation PBFORTUNE, a covert operation to overthrow Árbenz. The plan {{had originally been}} suggested by the US-backed dictator of Nicaragua, Anastasio Somoza García, who {{said that if he}} were given weapons, he could overthrow the Guatemalan government. The operation was to be led by Carlos Castillo Armas. However, the US state department discovered the conspiracy, and secretary of state Dean Acheson persuaded Truman to abort the plan. After being elected president of the US in November 1952, Dwight Eisenhower was more willing than Truman to use military tactics to remove regimes he disliked. Several figures in his administration, including Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and his brother and CIA director Allen Dulles had close ties to the United Fruit Company. <b>Undersecretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> Bedell Smith later became a director of the UFC, while the wife of the UFC public relations director was Eisenhower's personal assistant.

Thirteen months later, Nhek Bun Chhay and Ranariddh signed an agreement to merge NRP into FUNCINPEC, which provided for Ranariddh to become FUNCINPEC's president with Nhek Bun Chhay as his deputy. The agreement was brokered by Hun Sen, who wanted both parties to reunite. However, the merger agreement fell apart, as Nhek Bun Chhay and Ranariddh accused each other of harbouring thoughts of supporting other opposition parties. Subsequently, in March 2013, Nhek Bun Chhay was succeeded by Norodom Arunrasmy as the party's president, who in turn resumed his former role as the party's secretary-general. When general elections were held in July 2013, FUNCINPEC suffered defeat as it lost its remaining two seats which it held in the National Assembly. In turn, Nhek Bun Chhay relinquished his Deputy Prime Minister position and was made a government adviser, although the CPP-led government appointed 28 FUNCINPEC members as <b>undersecretaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>state.</b>|$|R

Manuilă was co-opted on the advisory council of the Commissariat for Transylvania's Liberated Regions, created by his patron Maniu as a special branch of government. Alongside the goal of returning Romanian administrators to the area, the Commissariat also made a specific point of dissuading Hungarian irredentism. Manuilă also campaigned internationally for the recognition of Romanian rule in Northern Transylvania, citing demographic and historical evidence in his English-language tract, The Vienna Award and Its Demographical Consequences (1945).

25|$|In April 1847, Polk sent <b>Undersecretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> and Chief Clerk Nicholas P. Trist to Mexico with a draft treaty. Secretary of State Buchanan told Trist {{that the}} Californias, upper and lower, New Mexico, and the Texas {{boundary}} were not negotiable. Because of the continued fighting and {{the reluctance of}} the Mexican government to appear frail, Trist did not make contact with Mexican authorities until June. On September 1, negotiations began and lasted five days, breaking down because Polk would not compromise on the Rio Grande boundary and Santa Anna would only give up the area north of Monterey, California, to the United States. He refused to yield any of New Mexico. Mexican politicians argued for continuing the war and stressed their reluctance to endorse any agreement that would give up national territory. Hearing about this, Polk decided to recall Trist, since Mexico would negotiate only if the terms were different. Trist became the Mexican government's only hope for resolution, and therefore gained power in the negotiations. He stayed true to the United States’ territorial ambitions, not yielding on the Rio Grande boundary, or backing down to Mexican resistance to giving up New Mexico and California.|$|E
