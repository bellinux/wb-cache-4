500|$|Rand {{described}} Night of January 16th as [...] "a sense-of-life play". She did {{not want}} its events to be taken literally, but {{to be understood as}} a representation of different ways of approaching life. Andre represents an ambitious, confident, non-conformist approach to life, while the prosecution witnesses represent conformity, envy of success, and the desire for power over others. Rand believed the jury's decision at each performance revealed the attitude of the jurors towards these two conflicting senses of life. Rand supported individualism and considered Andre [...] "not guilty". She said she wanted the play to convey the viewpoint: [...] "Your life, your achievement, your happiness, [...] are of paramount importance. Live <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> highest vision of yourself no matter what the circumstances you might encounter. An exalted view of self-esteem is man's most admirable quality". She said the play [...] "is not a philosophical treatise on morality" [...] and represents this view only in a basic way. Rand would later expound an explicit philosophy, which she called [...] "Objectivism", particularly in her 1957 novel Atlas Shrugged and in non-fiction essays, but Night of January 16th predates these more philosophical works.|$|E
500|$|Safran {{called the}} second season more cohesive, {{mirroring}} the first season and [...] "... keep the two-storyline structure". In an interview, he confirmed that the structure would be [...] "a little bit of flash-forward, but the majority will be what I like to call the present". According to Safran, the producers aimed at a more-mature, darker second season which would be [...] "less confusing" [...] to viewers. Safran had plotted an upcoming plot point as the first season ended, which saw Alex clearing her name, getting fired by the FBI and receiving a job offer by the CIA director. He revealed that the season-two storyline would focus on the contrasting work ethics of the FBI and the CIA. Safran elaborated {{about the differences between}} the FBI and CIA, saying: [...] "We're very interested {{in the fact that the}} FBI's so much about being honest, truthful and living <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> badge. And the CIA is the opposite. You succeed if you can deceive. So it's going to be interesting to see. It's like a funhouse mirror of what we've seen". He announced that the series would switch to a single timeline after the fourteenth episode. Safran said that {{the second season}} always intended to adopt a single timeline after the resolved storyline and the aftermath of the hostage crisis, adding [...] "When we broke Season 2, we knew we were going to go to one timeline, because it’s about the [...] event, and then it’s about what happens after the event. And you can’t flashback to the Farm after the crisis is over". He said that the change was also due to viewer complaints that the first season's dual timeline was confusing.|$|E

[...] He asked a Navajo girl there {{to call him}} when it snowed {{because he wanted to}} photograph it. [...] She did, more than once, {{but by the time he}} could get there, the snow had melted. [...] He kept persisting, finally pleading that she should call him when the snow [...] "gets <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> knees". [...] One morning she called and told Manley the snow was up to her knees. [...] He arrived in time and took some excellent pictures for Arizona Highways magazine.|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked about}} the biggest {{influence}} on him in comedy, Chappelle spoke highly praise to Richard Pryor, [...] "What a precedent he set. Not just as a comic, but as a dude. The fact that someone was able to open themselves wide-open like that. It's so hard to talk {{in front of people}} or to open yourself <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> closest friends. But to open yourself up for everybody: I freebase, I beat my women, I shot my car. And nobody's mad at Richard for that. They understand. Somehow they just understand. And when I was going through this thing this year, that is the example I would think to myself that gave me the courage to just go back on the stage." ...|$|E
2500|$|PC Zone hailed it as [...] "one {{of the few}} {{games that}} {{has the power to}} engage your {{imagination}} with pretty pictures, then actually live <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> imaginings when you get your hands on it". and GameZone gave it [...] "Editor's Choice", calling it [...] "a bona fide winner". However, GameSpy asked [...] "How much slack can you give a game that in many ways manages to achieve [...] lofty goal, but buries it under a painfully incomplete implementation?". Reviewers complained of low frame rates, frequent crashes, and bugs that made it impossible to complete the game; [...] "the game was simply unplayable out of the box". [...] "t's not that X3 is a bad game, or that it isn't fun - it just isn't done." [...] Complaints were also made about its complicated interface, exacerbated by an unhelpful manual which references [...] "features and options that aren't even in the final version".|$|E
2500|$|Ruben, {{a learned}} and pious Sephardi Jew living in exile at the [...] "Socola Academy", has {{instructed}} his favorite pupil about [...] "metempsychosis" [...] and apport: [...] "you can {{slip into the}} lives of all the ones who led <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> life [...] into all the future lives caused by your present life"; [...] "you can go any place you want, although you cannot leave it void behind you. [...] there's no such thing as fully vacant space." [...] Simultaneous travel in spacetime, Ruben teaches, may only happen if one changes places with one's ancestors or descendants. Taking the Dionis experience as evidence that Ruben is right, Dan asks to be transported into an ideal universe, and is told by his master that such a place exists [...] "in your immortal soul". If Dan wishes to reach it, he is to read every seventh page of a spell book: each will take him to a new place, in no known order, and no location can be visited twice. After Dan leaves, book in hand, Ruben is revealed to have been possessed by Satan, who takes joy at having ensnared a pious monk: the book is in fact an instrument of perdition.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks {{states that}} in Judaism humility is an {{appreciation}} of oneself, one's talents, skills, and virtues. [...] It is not meekness or self-deprecating thought, but the effacing of oneself to something higher. [...] Humility is not to think lowly of oneself, but to appreciate the self one has received. In recognition of the mysteries and complexities of life, one becomes humbled to the awesomeness one is and what one can achieve. [...] Rabbi Pini Dunner discusses that humility is to place others first; it is to appreciate others' worth as important. [...] In recognizing our worth as people, Rabbi Dunner shows that looking into the zillions of stars in the sky, and in the length and history of time, you and I are insignificant, like dust. Rabbi Dunner states that Moses wrote in the Torah, [...] "And Moses was exceedingly humble, more than any man {{on the face of}} the earth." [...] How is it possible to be humble and write you are the most humble? The conclusion is that Moses knew he was humble. It is not in denial of your talents and gifts but to recognize them and live <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> worth and something greater. [...] It is in the service to others that is the greatest form of humility.|$|E
