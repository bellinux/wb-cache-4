25|$|There {{are several}} web {{articles}} claiming that formaldehyde has been banned from manufacture or import into the European Union (EU) <b>under</b> <b>REACH</b> (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and restriction of Chemical substances) legislation. This {{appears to be}} misinformation, as official EU chemical databases contradict these claims as of February 19, 2010. This misconception has gained some ground. Formaldehyde is not listed in the Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 689/2008 (export and import of dangerous chemicals regulation), nor on a priority list for risk assessment. However, formaldehyde is banned from use in certain applications (preservatives for liquid-cooling and processing systems, slimicides, metalworking-fluid preservatives, and antifouling products) under the Biocidal Products Directive. In the EU, the maximum allowed concentration of formaldehyde in finished products is 0.2%, and any product that exceeds 0.05% has to include a warning that the product contains formaldehyde.|$|E

A 400 kV transmission system having midpoint connected STATCOM with its control circuit is modeled using MATLAB/SIMULINK software. The impact of STATCOM on distance relay for different fault conditions and different fault locations is analyzed. Simulation results indicate that the presence of the STATCOM in the transmission system significantly changes the line impedance seen by the distance relay to be lower or higher than the actual line impedance. Due to this the performance of the distance relay changes, either overreaches or <b>under</b> <b>reaches...</b>|$|R

50|$|The use of some {{phthalates}} {{has been}} restricted in the European Union {{for use in}} children's toys since 1999. DEHP, BBP, and DBP are restricted for all toys; DINP, DIDP, and DNOP are restricted only in toys {{that can be taken}} into the mouth. The restriction states that the amount of these phthalates may not be greater than 0.1% mass percent of the plasticized part of the toy. Generally the high molecular weight phthalates DINP, DIDP and DPHP have been registered <b>under</b> <b>REACH</b> (see below) and have demonstrated their safety for use in current applications. They are not classified for any health or environmental effects.|$|E
50|$|The low {{molecular}} weight products BBP, DEHP, DIBP, and DBP {{were added to the}} Candidate list of Substances for Authorisation <b>under</b> <b>REACH</b> in 2008-9, and added to the Authorisation list, Annex XIV, in 2012. This means that from February 2015 they are not allowed to be produced in the EU unless authorisation has been granted for a specific use, however they may still be imported in consumer products. The creation of an Annex XV dossier, which could ban the import of products containing these chemicals, is being jointly prepared by the ECHA and Danish authorities and is expected to be submitted by April 2016.|$|E
