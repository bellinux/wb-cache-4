I have endeavoured to avail myself of their remarks... My poems have been rightly charged with a profusion of double-epithets, and a general turgidness. I have pruned the double-epithets with no sparing hand; and <b>used</b> <b>my</b> best efforts to tame the swell and glitter both of thought and diction.|$|E
25|$|The game's soundtrack {{features}} about 170 licensed tracks accessible across twelve in-game {{radio stations}} while driving or at home. Station genres include alternative rock, reggae, hip hop, heavy metal, funk, R and 1980s pop, with {{artists such as}} Opeth, Duran Duran, Lamb of God, The <b>Used,</b> <b>My</b> Chemical Romance, Avenged Sevenfold, Paramore, Panic! at the Disco and Run-D.M.C. The player can create a custom playlist of the licensed tracks to play on a separate station.

25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of <b>used</b> <b>my</b> womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} was more guarded with Lennon's next album, Imagine (1971). Rolling Stone reported that [...] "it contains {{a substantial portion}} of good music" [...] but warned of the possibility that [...] "his posturings will soon seem not merely dull but irrelevant". The album's title track would become an anthem for anti-war movements, while another, [...] "How Do You Sleep?", was a musical attack on McCartney in response to lyrics from Ram that Lennon felt, and McCartney later confirmed, were directed at him and Ono. However, Lennon softened his stance in the mid-1970s and said he had written [...] "How Do You Sleep?" [...] about himself. He said in 1980: [...] "I <b>used</b> <b>my</b> resentment against Paul… to create a song… not a terrible vicious horrible vendetta I <b>used</b> <b>my</b> resentment and withdrawing from Paul and the Beatles, and the relationship with Paul, to write 'How Do You Sleep'. I don't really go 'round with those thoughts in my head all the time." ...|$|E

I'd <b>used</b> <b>my</b> real name, Tove Nilsson, when I was in Tremblebee so perhaps no-one knew who I was".|$|E

In the moment, I <b>used</b> <b>my</b> positive strength and I got a reward for the passion, the work not only I, but the masseur Mimmo Pezza did together in Rimini. The injury should take one month to heal, Mimmo Pezza helped me be fit in less than half that. I thank this man for a beautiful moment which will be in my heart {{for as long as}} I can remember."

500|$|Until now, Cardinale's {{own voice}} {{had not been}} used in her Italian films, as it was {{considered}} too hoarse, and owing to [...] her French accent, insufficiently Italian. Not until 8½ was she allowed to use her own voice. Cardinale explained: [...] "When I arrived for my first movie, I couldn't speak a word. I thought I was on the moon. I couldn't understand {{what they were talking}} about. And I was speaking in French; in fact I was dubbed. And Federico Fellini was the first one who <b>used</b> <b>my</b> voice. I think I had a very strange voice." [...] With her portrayal of Angelica in The Leopard and her brief appearance as herself in 8½, Cardinale achieved the definitive status of a top-ranking star.|$|E

He was also {{regarded}} as representing all that was apparently good about becoming American, even though {{until the end of}} his life the photos of my great-great-grandfather show him proudly wearing the uniforms and medals that accompanied his trips to faraway places as a diplomat for the Hawaiian Kingdom. He was never pictured wearing his uniforms, after the fact, for the Republic of Hawai‘i as its official diplomat. Even so, the territorial government regularly drew on his memories to close the gap between the Hawaiian Kingdom and the territory and in order to legitimize its own existence in the process. It needed to insert its inevitability into the historical narrative, and <b>used</b> <b>my</b> great-great-grandfather’s public memories to represent its [...] "evidence of inheritance." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, Cardinale starred opposite Jean-Paul Belmondo as Vénus in the 18th-century set adventure Cartouche, {{which made}} her a major star in France. She also played Angiolina, the romantic interest of Anthony Franciosa in Bolognini's Senilità, a character which film writer Jacek Klinowski describes as [...] "a spirited and strikingly beautiful twenty-year-old". In 1962, Cardinale was interviewed by the writer Alberto Moravia, who focused exclusively on her sexuality and body image in film, treating her as an object. Cardinale remarked to him: [...] "I <b>used</b> <b>my</b> body as a mask, as a representation of myself". The interview was published in Esquire under the title [...] "The Next Goddess of Love". Cardinale was amused {{to discover that the}} interview had inspired the writer to publish La dea dell'amore ("Goddess of Love") the following year, in which one of the characters, with her fine physical appearance and natural curves, closely resembled Cardinale. Just a few years later, she played a similar character in a film based on another novel by Moravia, Time of Indifference.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] {{was directed by}} Bryan Barber and choreographed by Jeri Slaugher. After seeing a trailer of Barber's film project, Idlewild, Aguilera {{wanted to make a}} video directed by him, explained: [...] "It intrigued me that this man, Bryan Barber, had been very locked into and had surrounded himself with this whole world of the '20s and '30s era, and it made me think that he could understand what I'm trying to do conceptually. I needed to get the right director who shared my vision". At first Aguilera planned to make a black-and-white video and shot it in her living room for Barber and Slaugher. [...] "I had acted out the entire video in my living room. I <b>used</b> <b>my</b> fireplace as a makeshift stage and the staircase as the pool table where I would stand", said Aguilera. According to Barber, Aguilera was very involved in the making of the videot. The whole team seemed like they were doing a movie more than a music video. On June 21, 2006, the music video for [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] was premiered on MTV's Total Request Live.|$|E

500|$|An {{article that}} {{appeared}} in the New York Times on December 26, 2011, [...] "Navigating Love and Autism" [...] by Amy Harmon, described how a young woman with Asperger syndrome <b>used</b> <b>My</b> Little Pony characters to relieve stress. She visualized the character Twilight Sparkle whenever she [...] "found herself in a bad-mood rut". The story misidentified Twilight Sparkle as Fluttershy on initial publication and the paper issued a correction, which some journalists have jokingly considered as [...] "the best New York Times correction ever", though others saw it {{as a sign of the}} journalistic integrity of the Times. Harmon was contacted by fans about the mistake, and said, [...] "I hate to get anything wrong, but I confess to some enjoyment in finding the right way to phrase this one." [...] In 2015, the New York Times reported that Dylann Roof, the suspect in the Charleston church shooting, was a fan of My Little Pony, but later corrected itself after recognizing it had been duped in a experiment run by a blogger, who had faked the claim but made it as credible as possible as to test how much fact checking major news sources were doing on a high-interest topic.|$|E

On October 2, 2013, {{after a few days}} of being credited as a co-producer of [...] "King Push", Joaquin Phoenix denied having assist in producing the song. He said, [...] "While it was widely reported that Pusha T <b>used</b> <b>my</b> beat and that I produced his song, I can't take any credit. A friend's son played me his music, and all I did was make an introduction to Kanye's camp." [...] On October 3, 2013, during an interview with Rap-Up, Pusha T revealed that it was actually the son of Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich who produced the song, saying [...] "Joaquin Phoenix gave the beat to 'Ye, so when I got the beat from 'Ye, it was, Yo, Joaquin gave me this beat. So me, I'm just like, OK, I know Joaquin's into music and you know the whole thing, so I'm like, Oh, damn. I believe it is the son of Lars Ulrich from Metallica. I hope I'm not wrong this time. It was mistaken because it came from Joaquin." [...] On October 1, 2013, the album was released for free streaming via MySpace.|$|E
