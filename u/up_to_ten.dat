The President has no power to remove current PCMR members.|$|E
5|$|The RAN {{originally}} intended to order <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>ten</b> DDLs.

Production of the ships was to be evenly split between Cockatoo Island Dockyard in Sydney and Williamstown Naval Dockyard in Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the {{colonization}} of the world's continents by rodents is complex.

5|$|In 1970 Kujau {{visited his}} family in East Germany and {{discovered}} {{that many of the}} locals held Nazi memorabilia, contrary to the laws of the communist government. He saw an opportunity to buy the material cheaply on the black market, and make a profit in the West, where the increasing demand among Stuttgart collectors was raising memorabilia prices <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>ten</b> times the amount he would pay. The trade was illegal in East Germany, and the export of what were deemed items of cultural heritage was banned. Among the items smuggled out of East Germany were weapons.|$|E

5|$|In October 2010, Pemco World Air Services and Precision Conversions {{launched}} aftermarket conversion {{programs to}} modify 757-200s into 757 Combi aircraft.

All three aftermarket conversions modify the forward portion of the aircraft to provide room for <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>ten</b> cargo pallets, while leaving the remaining space to fit around 45 to 58 passenger seats. This configuration is targeted at commercial charter flights which transport heavy equipment and personnel simultaneously. Customers for converted 757 Combi aircraft include the Air Transport Services Group, National Airlines, and North American Airlines.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{method to}} pump fluid in lab on chip devices with {{velocities}} <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>tens</b> of micrometer per second is introduced. A {{focused laser beam}} locally heats up an electrolyte. A net charge tends to accumulate in the heat-absorbing area, due to unequal tendencies {{of positive and negative}} ions to move {{in the presence of the}} temperature gradient. An external electric field then exerts a net force on the accumulated charge and consequently on water. This causes flow of water, with velocities <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>tens</b> of micrometer per second, for a simple NaCl+water solution. The method lets us change direction and amount of fluid pumping, simply by replacing the focal area. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

5|$|In {{a school}} of Pacific blue-eyes that is threatened, a few {{individuals}} accelerate and change direction, which initiates an escape wave that spreads through the whole cohort. Animals are known to dart in random directions and speeds as an escape response when threatened. Pacific blue-eyes on their own dart in this manner for <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>ten</b> seconds after being faced with a threat at close range. This period is briefer when faced with more distant threats or for fish in schools.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} most UK universities, Bristol is headed {{formally}} by the chancellor, currently Sir Paul Nurse and led {{on a day-to-day}} basis by the vice-chancellor, currently Hugh Brady, who is the academic leader and chief executive. There are four pro vice-chancellors and three ceremonial pro-chancellors. The chancellor may hold office for <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>ten</b> years and the pro-chancellors for up to three, unless the University Court determines otherwise, but the vice-chancellor and pro-vice-chancellors have no term limits. The vice-chancellor is supported by a deputy vice-chancellor.|$|E
5|$|Rarely cultivated, Banksia ilicifolia {{requires}} a sunny position and sandy well-drained soil to do well. A slow-growing plant, it takes <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>ten</b> years to flower from seed. The glossy green foliage and long flowering period, combined with prominently displayed flowers give it horticultural potential, although its prickly foliage makes fallen leaves {{a problem if}} planted near lawns or walkways. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 22 to 41 days to germinate. Difficulties in collection and low seed set make seed relatively expensive. Seeds are often eaten by insects {{before they can be}} collected.|$|E
40|$|Large {{electrical}} potentials, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>tens</b> of millivolts, can {{be recorded}} with extra-cellular electrodes from hydrozoan coelenterates.

5|$|Seabirds' life {{histories}} are dramatically {{different from those}} of land birds. In general, they are K-selected, live much longer (anywhere between twenty and sixty years), delay breeding for longer (for <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>ten</b> years), and invest more effort into fewer young. Most species will only have one clutch a year, unless they lose the first (with a few exceptions, like the Cassin's auklet), and many species (like the tubenoses and sulids), only one egg a year.|$|E

Only those civilians with essential jobs were allowed to stay but it gave the entire community a sense of being 'British' by sharing in the war effort.|$|E
