2500|$|The 2004 model S2000 {{underwent}} several significant changes. Production {{moved to}} Suzuka. The new model introduced [...] wheels and Bridgestone RE-050 tires {{along with a}} retuned suspension to reduce oversteer. The spring rates and shock absorber damping were altered and the suspension geometry modified to improve stability by reducing toe-in changes <b>under</b> <b>cornering</b> loads. The subframe also received a revision in design to achieve a high rigidity. In the gearbox the brass synchronizers were replaced with carbon fiber. In addition, cosmetic changes {{were made to the}} exterior with new front and rear bumpers, revised headlight assemblies, new LED tail-lights, and oval-tipped exhausts. Although all the cosmetic, suspension and most drivetrain upgrades were included on the Japanese, Australian and European S2000s, they retained the 2.0l F20C engines and remained designated as AP1s.|$|E
2500|$|While the SA22/FB was a purer sports car, the FC tended {{toward the}} softer sport-tourer trends of its day, sharing some {{similarities}} with the HB series Cosmo. Handling was much improved, with {{less of the}} oversteer tendencies of the FB. The rear end design was vastly improved from the FB's live rear axle to a more modern, Independent Rear Suspension (rear axle). Steering was more precise, with {{rack and pinion steering}} replacing the old recirculating ball steering of the FB. Disc brakes also became standard, with some models (S4: Sport, GXL, GTU, Turbo II, Convertible; S5: GXL, GTUs, Turbo, Convertible) offering four-piston front brakes. The rear seats were optional in some models of the FC RX-7, but are not commonly found in the American Market. Mazda also introduced Dynamic Tracking Suspension System (DTSS) in the 2nd generation RX-7. The revised independent rear suspension incorporated special toe control hubs which were capable of introducing a limited degree of passive rear steering <b>under</b> <b>cornering</b> loads. The DTSS worked by allowing a slight amount of toe-out under normal driving conditions but induced slight toe-in under heavier cornering loads at around 0.5 Gs or more; toe-out in the rear allows for a more responsive rotation of the rear, but toe-in allowed for a more stable rear under heavier cornering. [...] Mazda also introduced Auto Adjusting Suspension (AAS) in the 2nd generation RX-7. The system changed damping characteristics according to the road and driving conditions. [...] The system compensated for camber changes and provided anti-dive and anti-squat effects.|$|E
50|$|Wheel rate on {{independent}} suspension is fairly straightforward. However, special consideration {{must be taken}} with some non-{{independent suspension}} designs. Take {{the case of the}} straight axle. When viewed from the front or rear, the wheel rate can be measured by the means above. Yet because the wheels are not independent, when viewed from the side under acceleration or braking the pivot point is at infinity (because both wheels have moved) and the spring is directly inline with the wheel contact patch. The result is often that the effective wheel rate <b>under</b> <b>cornering</b> is different from what it is under acceleration and braking. This variation in wheel rate may be minimized by locating the spring as close to the wheel as possible.|$|E

40|$|Springer International Publishing AG 2018. In {{the design}} of {{structures}} against progressive collapse, tie-force method <b>under</b> missing <b>corner</b> column is deemed to be ineffective in providing resistance and integrity to the structures. This is because the structure is left with inadequate horizontal restraints to develop catenary action. Previous tests on Reinforced concrete (RC) beam-slab specimens <b>under</b> <b>corner</b> column removal scenarios subject to point load have identified little development of catenary action in the beam and tensile membrane action (TMA) in the slab, and the beam-slab specimens mainly relied on flexural capacity to resist the point loads. But in reality, the beam-slab system is subjected to uniform distributed load (UDL), and not point loads. It is only due to expediency in testing that researchers subject the beam-slab specimen to point loads. Thus, there have not been any beam-slab system tests <b>under</b> <b>corner</b> column removal scenarios subjected to UDL. The novelty {{of this paper is}} to conduct one such test with the beam-slab specimen subjected to UDL. The surprising finding was that TMA was developed in the beam-slab specimen. The inclusion of TMA may provide an upper bound or a more realistic prediction in progressive collapse analysis of corner beam-slab systems subject to UDL. The test result of the beam-slab specimen subject to UDL was also compared with that of the specimen subject to point loads, to understand the differences in load-carrying mechanisms and capacities between the two types of loadings...|$|R

50|$|Traditionally both down-draft (DCNF & IDF) and side-draft (DCOE) twin-choke {{carburettors}} {{have been}} used to extract more power from the 128 derived engines. IDFs are rarely used due to an incorrect orientation of the float-bowls (causing possible surge/starve issues <b>under</b> <b>cornering),</b> the correctly orientated DCNF being the preferred down-draft carburettor in this application (also having a much lower profile than the IDF). For ultimate power the DCOE carburettor is used even though the float-bowl direction matches that of the IDF (i.e. incorrect). The aforementioned carburettors are usually used in pairs (effectively giving one independently tuneable carburettor per engine-cylinder), though applications where a single DCNF/DCOE are used to feed a shared manifold do exist. DCNF's tend to be either 36 mm or 40 mm, the larger 44-DCNF is deemed too large for the engine. Both 40-DCOE and 45-DCOE are commonly used where space allows.|$|E

In this framework, the welfare dominance of deposit contracts emerges <b>under</b> <b>corner</b> preferences. It is shown that aggregate uncertainty creates high price volatility of ex-dividend equity claims traded in a secondary market and the resulting consumption allocations offer less risk-sharing opportunities to risk-averse consumers than tailor-made deposit contracts. The contingency of early payoffs on depositorsâ€™ withdrawal order reinforces the welfare performance of deposit contracts, whereas costly liquidation of productive long-term investments deteriorates their welfare performance relative to equity contracts...|$|R

5000|$|The final major {{facelift}} for the GT6 came in 1970 in {{the form}} of the Mk III. This time the entire bodyshell was revised to match the changes made to the Spitfire Mk IV: modifications included a cut-off rear end, recessed door handles and a smoother front end. Only detail changes were made to the mechanics, but in 1973 - close to the end of the car's production life - the rear suspension was changed again, this time for the cheaper (but still effective) [...] "swing-spring" [...] layout fitted to the Spitfire Mk IV. This was a modification of the swing axle rear suspension used on the Herald-derived models, with the transverse leaf spring mounted on a pivot, eliminating roll stiffness at the rear, and thus greatly reducing the jacking effect <b>under</b> <b>cornering</b> loads. To compensate for this loss of roll stiffness, a larger front anti-roll bar was fitted. A brake servo was also added in 1973, and seats were changed from vinyl to cloth. There was still a fairly comprehensive options list, but the knock-on wire wheels were no longer available. The unladen weight increased slightly to 2030 lb.|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of motion cueing algorithms {{have been developed}} for passenger car applications, with correspondingly less research dedicated to race-car and high-performance vehicle simulators. In the high-performance context, the focus is on cueing the vehicle's behavioural and handling characteristics, particularly when driving near the limits of performance. In race-car simulators the cueing requirements are therefore quite different, with the problem made all the more challenging by the presence of large accelerations. To understand the drivers' cueing needs, the vehicle's stability and handling response characteristics must be examined near the performance boundary. Frozen-time eigenvalue analyses are used to determine stability and response characteristics across all vehicle operating conditions, including accelerating and braking <b>under</b> <b>cornering,</b> with the results used to determine motion cueing algorithm requirements. Lateral acceleration and yaw cueing filters are designed in order to retain information critical to understanding the vehicle's behaviour on its performance boundary. Cueing filters are then tested, {{with the help of a}} professional race-car driver, and are found to provide the cues necessary for the driver to control the vehicle on the limit of performance...|$|E

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this {{numerical}} investigation is to analyze the characteristic of inside and outside flow fields of air-cooled condenser (ACC) cell in power plant. The fin-tube bundles are modeled using porous regions, and fan blade passages are modeled in details to gain accurately fan exhaust flows. Results of numerical investigation indicate that rotational fan exhaust flows lead to inside rotational symmetry flows and distributions of outflows from fin-tube bundles in A-frame ACC cell. When rotational flows are in same direction of ACC outflows in the area, high pressure increases the ACC mass outflows. In the <b>under</b> <b>corner</b> near the ACC inlet with inconsistent interfaces, less ACC outflows appear because of air flows paralleling to the ACC outflow side, influenced by the rotational flows...|$|R
