5|$|In 1789, Sally and James Hemings {{returned}} to the United States with Jefferson. He was 46 years old and seven years a widower. As shown by Jefferson's father-in-law, John Wayles, wealthy Virginia widowers frequently raped enslaved women. Historian Joshua D. Rothman noted it was not <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> time for Jefferson to choose to do so. White society simply expected these men to be discreet.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologists {{have named}} an extinct {{bandicoot}} from the Miocene of Australia after the character, Crash bandicoot. Although somewhat <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> scientific community, {{the name was}} used in an entirely unaltered form, without attempting to return to Latin or Greek roots.|$|E
5|$|The castle's layout was <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> region {{during this}} period, where the fortifications {{built by the}} Normans were {{typically}} smaller ringwork designs, and it highlighted both the strategic importance of the location {{and the power of}} its builder. In scale and design it was similar to the initial version of Rochester Castle, another major fortification built by Odo in England.|$|E

50|$|Frederick was {{two years}} younger than Ellen, which was <b>unusual,</b> <b>for</b> at <b>the</b> time, men often married women far younger than themselves.|$|R
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland, who was intrigued by the story because {{he had not seen}} many television episodes about vegetarianism. The designs for Paul and Linda McCartney are <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> Simpsons in that the characters have brown and blue irises, respectively. Most The Simpsons characters simply have black spots in the centers of their eyes.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} {{painting}} met with mixed reactions from art critics and historians. Artists had previously tended to depict {{war in the}} high style of history painting, and Goya's unheroic description was <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> time. According to some early critical opinion the painting was flawed technically: the perspective is flat, or the victims and executioners are standing too close together to be realistic. Although these observations may be strictly correct, the writer Richard Schickel argues that Goya was not striving for academic propriety but rather to strengthen the overall impact of the piece.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} fifteen, Johnson was apprenticed to George Keith, a London {{bookseller}} {{who specialized}} in publishing religious tracts such as Reflections on the Modern but Unchristian Practice of Innoculation. As Gerald Tyson, Johnson's major modern biographer, explains, it was <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> younger son of a family living in relative obscurity to move to London and to become a bookseller. Scholars have speculated that Johnson was indentured to Keith because the bookseller was associated with Liverpool Baptists. Keith and Johnson published several works together later in their careers, {{which suggests that the}} two remained on friendly terms after Johnson started his own business.|$|E

50|$|The first {{movement}} is in 5-part rondo form instead of sonata form, <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> Beethoven. <b>The</b> tempo is slow, {{interrupted by a}} fast medial section.|$|R
5|$|For {{much of the}} 17th century, England was {{embroiled in}} {{conflict}} with commercial rival Holland through the Anglo-Dutch Wars. Rupert became closely involved in these as a senior Admiral to King Charles II, rising to command the Royal Navy {{by the end of}} his career. Although several famous admirals of the day had previously been army commanders, including Blake and Monk, they had commanded relatively small land forces and Rupert was still relatively <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> period in having both practical experience of commanding large land armies and having extensive naval experience from his campaigns in the 1650s.|$|E
5|$|Joshua Humphreys' {{design was}} <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> time, being long on keel and narrow of beam (width) and {{mounting}} very heavy guns. The design {{called for a}} diagonal scantling (rib) scheme intended to restrict hogging while giving the ships extremely heavy planking. This design gave the hull a greater strength than a more lightly built frigate. Humphreys' design was based on his realization that the fledgling United States of the period could not match the European states {{in the size of}} their navies. This being so, the frigates were designed to overpower other frigates with the ability to escape from a ship of the line.|$|E
5|$|King Charles's Castle is {{a ruined}} {{artillery}} fort overlooking New Grimsby harbour {{on the island}} of Tresco in the Isles of Scilly. Built between 1548 and 1551 to protect the islands from French attack, it would have held a battery of guns and an accompanying garrison, designed to prevent enemy vessels from entering the harbour. The castle is polygonal in design, constructed from granite stone, with the gun battery at the front, and a dining room, kitchen and living accommodation at the rear. An additional defensive earthwork was constructed around it during the 17th century. The design of the castle is <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> period, and is only seen elsewhere in blockhouses along the River Thames.|$|E

5|$|On 15 September 1891, {{a general}} meeting {{took place at}} Royal Street Hall, near Everton Valley. Everton's {{chairman}} John Houlding proposed that a limited company be formed and that the company should purchase his land and local brewer Joseph Orrel's adjacent land for a combined £9,237. A club run as a limited company was <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> time as football clubs were usually run as “sports clubs” with members paying an annual fee. The proposal was supported by William Barclay, the club secretary and {{a close friend of}} Houlding.|$|E
5|$|Orisini's {{election}} was notable {{at the time}} because it was <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cardinals to elect friars, since they were seen by some as too rigid. Members of religious orders {{at the time were}} often respected by the cardinals, but rarely elected, with Benedict XIII being only the fourth since the Council of Trent. Unlike the other mendicants elected to the papacy in this period, he was of noble birth, being the eldest son of the Duke of Gravina, but had forfeited his rights to his father's title in order to enter the Dominicans.|$|E
5|$|The United States Military Academy (USMA) is an {{undergraduate}} college in West Point, New York {{with the mission}} of educating and commissioning officers for the United States Army. The list is drawn from non-graduate former cadets and cadet candidates. It is not <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> service academies to have high dropout rates. Of the original 103 cadets in the Class of 1826, only 43 graduated. Non-graduates of the Academy have entered a variety of fields. Notable non-graduates include Edgar Allan Poe (literature), James Abbott McNeill Whistler (art), Maynard James Keenan (music), Adam Vinatieri (football), and even the military: Jacob Zeilin, Lewis Addison Armistead, and Courtney Hodges.|$|E

5|$|The game {{uses the}} visual effect of {{applying}} pre-rendered video footage to a polygon, specifically the game's pre-recorded {{shows on the}} television. IGN writer Anoop Gantayat praised this effect's implementation, although he did note some minor graphical issues visible in the transition from distanced to full-screen viewing. Also <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Pokémon video game series, the Pokémon's voices are borrowed from the anime and sound like their names.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} cruck {{hall was}} replaced by the present Great Hall in 1512, after Sir Alexander Radclyffe was appointed High Sheriff of Lancashire. The hall is typical of others built at that time in the northwest of England, although {{it is one of the}} largest, and is <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> period in having no wall fireplace. The hall has an elaborate roof structure, as in the similar Rufford Old Hall. There is a slightly later small room above the large oriel bay, which may be an early addition as at Samlesbury Hall.|$|E
5|$|When Saladin {{restored}} Sunni orthodoxy in Egypt, 10 madrasas {{were established}} during his reign, {{and an additional}} 25 during the entire Ayyubid period of rule. Each of their locations had religious, political, and economic significance, in particular those in al-Fustat. Most of the schools were dedicated to the Shafi'i denomination, but others belonged to the Maliki and Hanafi madhabs. The madrasas built near the tomb of Imam al-Shafi'i were located adjacent to the important centers of pilgrimage and were {{a major focus of}} Sunni devotion. About 26 schools were built in Egypt, Jerusalem and Damascus by high-ranking government officials, and <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> time, commoners also founded in Egypt about 18 schools, including two medical institutions.|$|E

5|$|Dustan's {{father was}} a shop manager for the Morris Hedstrom chain in Fiji. However, {{from an early age}} Don was educated in Australia, and grew up as part of the Adelaide establishment. He excelled academically before {{experiencing}} his progressive political awakening while training in law and arts at the University of Adelaide. His upper-class background and scholarly bearing made him <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Labor Party at the time, but he rose quickly and entered parliament at the age of 26. Dunstan quickly achieved prominence as Labor's standout performer, a charismatic and aggressive debater in an era of sedate political conduct. The dominant political figure at the time was Premier Thomas Playford IV, then leading the Liberal and Country League (LCL) through a 27-year hold on power, aided by a system of electoral malapportionment dubbed the Playmander, which gave undue weight to the LCL's rural base since its introduction by the LCL in 1936. Dunstan stridently pursued the LCL over the Playmander.|$|E
5|$|Females vacate {{the nest}} after spawning, leaving the male behind {{to protect the}} eggs during the eight to ten days of incubation. A nest may contain 2,000 to 5,000 eggs, {{possibly}} more. Fecundity is usually related to size of the fish, so it isn't <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> roe of a large gravid female to contain over 55,000 eggs. Bowfin eggs are adhesive, and will attach to aquatic vegetation, roots, gravel, and sand. After hatching, larval bowfin do not swim actively in search of food. During the seven to nine days required for yolk-sac absorption, they attach to vegetation {{by means of an}} adhesive organ on their snout, and remain protected by the parent male bowfin. Bowfin aggressively protect their spawn from the first day of incubation to a month or so after the eggs have hatched. When the fry are able to swim and forage on their own, they will form a school and leave the nest accompanied by the parent male bowfin who slowly circles them to prevent separation.|$|E
5|$|Framlingham Castle is {{a castle}} {{in the market}} town of Framlingham in Suffolk in England. An early motte and bailey or ringwork Norman castle {{was built on the}} Framlingham site by 1148, but this was {{destroyed}} by Henry II of England {{in the aftermath of the}} revolt of 1173–4. Its replacement, constructed by Roger Bigod, the Earl of Norfolk, was <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> time in having no central keep, but instead using a curtain wall with thirteen mural towers to defend the centre of the castle. Despite this, the castle was successfully taken by King John in 1216 after a short siege. By the end of the 13th century, Framlingham had become a luxurious home, surrounded by extensive parkland used for hunting.|$|E
25|$|The Caltech–MIT rivalry is <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> both <b>the</b> {{geographic}} {{distance between}} the schools (their campuses are separated by about 2500 miles and are on opposite coasts of the United States) and the focus on elaborate pranks rather than sporting events.|$|R
50|$|The song, {{like most}} Kinks songs, is sung by Ray Davies. The piano, played by session man Nicky Hopkins, is {{played in a}} honky-tonk fashion.
