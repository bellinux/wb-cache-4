5000|$|An {{ultrasound}} research interface (URI) is {{a software}} tool loaded onto a diagnostic clinical ultrasound device which provides functionality beyond typical clinical modes of operation. Before an ultrasound image can be displayed to the user, it must undergo {{a series of}} transformations, typically {{referred to as the}} ultrasound processing chain. As data moves through the processing chain, it may be desirable to acquire it at certain intervals, so it can be processed offline for research purposes. A set of processing parameters sent to the ultrasound device control how the processing chain performs its operations. It may also be desirable to change these processing parameters to achieve different imaging results. A clinical ultrasound user only has access to the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>data</b> in its final processed form, referred to as a B-Mode image. The format of the images are typically in the DICOM file format. The clinical user also has limited access to the processing parameters that can be modified; for reasons of device usability, and so the device cannot be put into a state that renders itself inoperable.|$|E
40|$|Data {{acquired}} from ultrasound examinations {{is of interest}} {{not only for the}} physician, but also for the patient. While the physician uses the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>data</b> for diagnostic purposes the patient might be more interested in beautiful images in the case of prenatal imaging. <b>Ultrasound</b> <b>data</b> is noisy by nature and visually compelling 3 D renderings are not always trivial to produce. This paper presents a technique which enables extraction of a smooth surface mesh from the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>data</b> by combining previous research in ultrasound processing with research in point cloud surface reconstruction. After filtering the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>data</b> using Variational Classification we extract a set of surface points.

The resulting technique can be used to extract surfaces with adjustable smoothness and resolution and has been tested on various ultrasound datasets...|$|E
40|$|For many navigated {{surgical}} procedures, {{the precise}} registration of preoperative data sets with {{bones of the}} patient is an important requisite. Conventional navigation systems use paired point registration based on anatomical landmarks or fiducial markers. This approach increases the invasiveness, since landmarks must be exposed and fiducial markers must {{be connected to the}} bone. Intraoperative imaging modalities can overcome this disadvantage. Ultrasound seems to be ideal because of the easy data acquisition. The problem, however, is the low imaging quality regarding bones. The proposed algorithm for the registration of CT and <b>ultrasound</b> <b>data</b> sets considers the ultrasound imaging properties. That part of the bone surface, which should be visible in the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>data</b> is estimated from the CT data. The <b>ultrasound</b> <b>data</b> is preprocessed to emphasize bone surfaces. Thus, the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>data</b> contains a bright shape that is formed like the surface estimated from the CT data. A surface–volume registration tries to correlate the estimated surface with this bright shape. The algorithm was validated using an ex vivo preparation of a human lumbar spine.

40|$|Abstract. Computer based navigated surgery assists {{the spatial}} {{orientation}} of the surgeon. Our system registers preoperative data like CT or MR with intraoperative <b>ultrasound</b> <b>data</b> to get the coordinate transformation between the preoperative and the intraoperative data. With a surface volume registration we avoid a difficult surface segmentation in the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>data.</b> To prevent radial exposure and to get more details in the soft tissue the use of MR data for the operation planning is common. Extracting the bone surface in MR data is more difficult than in CT data because MR data has no normalized gray values. To register the ultrasound with the MR data at the knee we detected distinctive anatomic regions in the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>data.</b> We selected an adequate MR sequence in which we could segment the bone surface at the specific region.

40|$|Visual {{interpretation}} of noisy images {{is not an}} easy problem. This is certainly apparent with ultrasound images. Due to the noise inherent in the images, it is often the case that discrepancies as to location of object boundaries and detection of different tissues arise even among highly trained physicians. The relatively low cost and short image acquisition time, however, make ultrasound an attractive imaging modality. Currently, diagnostic evaluation of ultrasound images is performed on two-dimensional (2 D) cross-sections of the object of interest. No depth information is available {{and there is no way}} of viewing the outer surface of the object. The only way for a physician to visualise the entire object is by mentally reconstructing the object based on a series of a 2 D images as well as prior expectations of the morphology of the object. In the case of abnormal or diseased growth, the physician's expectations often do not correspond to the actual morphology of the object. However, the use of three-dimensional (3 D) data acquisition and visualisation may be used to overcome these problems. The present work addresses a number of difficulties in processing 3 D <b>ultrasound</b> <b>data.</b> This includes special treatment of the volumetric <b>ultrasound</b> <b>data</b> obtained from a 3 D probe, determination of 3 D features of the different tissue types present in the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>data</b> and identification and localisation of objects (segmentation) in the volumetric <b>ultrasound</b> <b>data.</b> Experimental results obtained from synthesised and real <b>ultrasound</b> <b>data</b> demonstrate that the present work contributes significantly to the use of ultrasound imaging as a diagnostic tool. As well, the present work can be applied to different imaging modalities or different applications areas and is thus beneficial to the area of biomedical image processing, in general...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Displacement {{estimation}} is {{an essential}} step for ultrasound elastography and numerous techniques have been proposed to improve its quality using two frames of <b>ultrasound</b> RF <b>data.</b> This paper introduces a technique for calculating a displacement field from three frames of <b>ultrasound</b> RF <b>data.</b> To this end, we first introduce constraints on variations of the displacement field with time using mechanics of materials. These constraints are then used to generate a regularized cost function that incorporates amplitude similarity of three ultrasound images and displacement continuity. We optimize the cost function in an expectation maximization (EM) framework. Iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) is used to minimize the effect of outliers. We show that, compared to using two images, the new algorithm reduces {{the noise of the}} displacement estimation. The displacement field is used to generate strain images for quasi-static elastography. Phantom experiments and in-vivo patient trials of imaging liver tumors and monitoring ablation therapy of liver cancer are presented for validation. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{approach}} for acquiring dimensionally accurate 3 D <b>ultrasound</b> <b>data,</b> {{based on a}} modified 1 D transducer array, is presented. The method avoids many of the drawbacks of conventional approaches to 3 D <b>ultrasound</b> <b>data</b> acquisition. Scanning is simple and easy to perform in a clinical setting. A modified 1 D transducer array is employed comprising a central conventional 1 D ‘Imaging ’ array and two perpendicular ‘Tracking ’ arrays – each integrally mounted {{at each end of}} the ‘Imaging ’ array. As the transducer is scanned in the elevation direction of the central array, the images acquired by the ‘Tracking ’ arrays remain coplanar and hence it is possible to accurately track image motion using any one of several image tracking techniques. Methods for improving the performance and ergonomics of the transducer array are presented. In particular, a crossed electrode transducer structure is proposed for minimizing the total transducer ‘footprint ’ (contact surface area). The versatility of the approach in terms of its suitability for scanning breast, carotid and prostate is discussed. We have acquired both phantom and in-vivo 3 D <b>ultrasound</b> <b>data</b> with the prototype imaging approach.
