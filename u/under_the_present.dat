It {{is a member of}} the family Formicidae, belonging to the order Hymenoptera, an order of insects containing ants, bees, and wasps. The genus Froggattella is the sister group of Iridomyrmex, both of which are in a clade that is 23 million years old. Fossils related to the meat ant and other species are from the Eocene and Oligocene.|$|E

5|$|In 2006 and 2007, a {{team from}} the University of West Bohemia, {{together}} with Salahaddin University in Arbil, carried out an extensive survey and evaluation of the entire citadel. As part of this project, geodetic measurements of the citadel were taken and these were combined with satellite imagery, regular photographic imagery and aerial photographs to create a map and digital 3D model of the citadel mound and the houses on top of it. Geophysical prospection {{was carried out in}} some areas of the citadel to detect traces of older architecture buried <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> houses. Archaeological investigations included an archaeological survey on the western slope of the citadel mound, and the excavation of a small test trench {{in the eastern part of}} the citadel.|$|E
5|$|<b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> classification, Myrmecia is {{the only}} extant genus in the tribe Myrmeciini, {{subfamily}} Myrmeciinae. It {{is a member of}} the family Formicidae, belonging to the order Hymenoptera. The type species for the genus is M. gulosa, discovered by Joseph Banks in 1770 during his expedition with James Cook on the HMS Endeavour. M. gulosa is among the earliest Australian insects to be described, and the specimen Banks collected is housed in the Joseph Banks Collection in the Natural History Museum in London. M. gulosa was described by Fabricius in 1775 under the name Formica gulosa and later designated as the type species of Myrmecia in 1840.|$|E
5|$|UNESCO {{identified}} three {{specific areas of}} concern <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> state of conservation: (i) vandalism by visitors; (ii) soil erosion in the south-eastern part of the site; and (iii) analysis and restoration of missing elements. The soft soil, the numerous earthquakes and heavy rains lead to the destabilization of the structure. Earthquakes {{are by far the}} most important contributing factors, since not only do stones fall down and arches crumble, but the earth itself can move in waves, further destroying the structure. The increasing popularity of the stupa brings in many visitors, most of whom are from Indonesia. Despite warning signs on all levels not to touch anything, the regular transmission of warnings over loudspeakers and the presence of guards, vandalism on reliefs and statues is a common occurrence and problem, leading to further deterioration. As of 2009, there is no system in place {{to limit the number of}} visitors allowed per day or to introduce mandatory guided tours only.|$|E
