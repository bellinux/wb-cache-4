5000|$|Unconditional format: There is {{also the}} [...] {{parameter}} that performs an <b>unconditional</b> <b>format</b> which under most circumstances overwrites the entire partition, preventing the recovery of data through software. Note however that the [...] switch only works reliably with floppy diskettes (see image to the right). Technically because unless [...] is used, floppies are always low level formatted in addition to high-level formatted. Under certain circumstances with hard drive partitions, however, the [...] switch merely prevents the creation of [...] information in the partition to be formatted while otherwise leaving the partition's contents entirely intact (still on disk but marked deleted). In such cases, the user's data remain ripe for recovery with specialist tools such as EnCase or disk editors. Reliance upon [...] for secure overwriting of hard drive partitions is therefore inadvisable, and purpose-built tools such as DBAN should be considered instead.|$|E
