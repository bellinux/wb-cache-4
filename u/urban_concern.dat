40|$|Strategy {{frames the}} {{contemporary}} epistemological space of urbanism: major {{cities across the}} globe such as New York, London and Sydney invest time, energy and resources to craft urban strategies. Extensive empirical research projects have proposed a shift towards a strategic framework to manage cities. This theoretical curiosity {{is reflected in the}} rising interest in urban strategy from practice. For instance, the World Bank regularly organizes an Urban Strategy Speaker Series, while the powerful network CEOs for Cities lobbies for a strategic approach to urban development. Critical scholars such as Zukin diagnose not a shift in but a shift to strategic thinking in the con-temporary city. This article poses the question: what makes strategy such an attractive ‘thought style ’ in relation to imagining and managing cities? How can we understand the practice of urban strategy? And what are its intended and unintended consequences? The objective {{of this article is to}} analyse strategy as a socio-political practice that shapes cities, and by extension, soci-ety at large.

40|$|Drawing {{on recent}} {{theories}} of citizenship that argue {{the city as}} the pre-eminent 'difference machine', this paper argues that {{it is also a}} crucial site for the production of resistance as a social identity and practice. This argument is presented through an analysis of an example from the 'Red Power' movement in the US in the 1960 s and early 1970 s. The paper examines how American Indian activism-while often dramatised in rural reservation locations and centred on rather grand abstractions quite far removed from typically <b>urban</b> <b>concerns</b> and politics-also has a profoundly urban historical geography. ...|$|R

The social historian may properly begin with the French regime in the early seventeenth century, proceed to the British Conquest in 1763, and on to the effects of the American Revolution in 1775, and through to Confederation in 1867 and to the establishment of “The Railway” and the opening up of the Canadian West, all this time - nearly three hundred years of history - being concerned mainly with topics related to a predominantly rural mode of life...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Using ethnographic methods, 28 young {{professionals}} across the global cities of London, Los Angeles, and Tokyo were studied to understand {{in some detail}} what items they carried with them (their mobile kits) and how they used these items to access people, places, and services (through various urban interfaces). The findings are analyzed in terms of these cities as existing sites of ubiquitous information and communication technology (ICT) use. More specifically, findings are considered {{with respect to the}} prospects in these cities for ubicomp as a paradigm of trusted, environmentally embedded computing, as opposed to a wearable computing paradigm of individual self-sufficiency. Overall, at least for the young professional class studied, practices of urban interfacing were remarkably similar across all three cities studied, suggesting that ubicomp systems might be developed to address the range of <b>urban</b> <b>concerns</b> and to unburden and empower urbanites. ...|$|R

500|$|Getty's {{relationship}} with his own party was often stormy. [...] Shortly after he lost his riding in 1989, a group of Calgary Conservatives, including party budget director Jack Major and Getty's old leadership rival Ron Ghitter, began making plans to force party renewal, with or without Getty. [...] They felt that the party was perceived as being tired, directionless, arrogant, and deaf to <b>urban</b> <b>concerns,</b> {{and that it was}} in political trouble in the crucial battleground of Calgary. [...] At the 1989 party convention, recently retired cabinet minister Marvin Moore, who had organized Ghitter's 1985 leadership campaign, advocated for a leadership review; after a speech by Getty, the convention voted to refer the recommendation to a committee for months of study. [...] Cabinet ministers, including Treasurer Dick Johnston and Education Minister Jim Dinning, began to consider leadership bids in the event that Getty retired or was pushed out.|$|R
50|$|As {{the saying}} goes, {{in real estate}} only three things matter: location, location, location.

25|$|The student {{movement}} began to coalesce after the government's assault on Vocational School #5, which {{marked the first}} major infringement on student autonomy. The movement began to gain support from students outside the capital and from other segments of society, which continued to build until that October. Students formed brigadas (brigades), groups of six or more students who distributed leaflets about the issues in the streets, markets, and most often on public buses. These parochial organizations, the smallest units of the CNH, decided the scope and issues which the {{student movement}} would take up. These included both rural and <b>urban</b> <b>concerns.</b> The brigadistas would board buses {{to speak to the}} passengers about the government's corruption and repression, while others distributed leaflets and collected donations. Eventually, the passengers and bus drivers began to sympathize with the students’ demands for democracy and justice, and the students collected increasing amounts of money. But the aggressive militancy among the students began to disillusion some bus drivers about the students’ motives, and they suspected the youths of seeking power for its own sake.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{two distinct}} interpretations of self-organisation {{with regard to}} civic initiatives in <b>urban</b> development. One <b>concerns</b> <b>urban</b> developments in which citizens deliberately organise themselves in order to realise a collective ambition. This interpretation of self-organisation resonates with forms of self-governance. The other is embedded in complexity sciences. It stresses the spontaneous emergence of urban structures on a particular scale out of the uncoordinated interactions between initiatives on a lower level. The paper highlights the similarities and the fundamental differences between both understandings of self-organisation. It also identifies implications of these differences for research on spatial planning policy and recommendations for civic initiatives in urban development...|$|R
