5|$|The {{electric}} field was formally {{defined as the}} force exerted per <b>unit</b> <b>charge,</b> but the concept of potential allows for a more useful and equivalent definition: the {{electric field}} is the local gradient of the electric potential. Usually expressed in voltspermetre, the vector direction of the field is the line of greatest slope of potential, and where the equipotentials lie closest together.|$|E
5|$|An {{electric}} field generally varies in space, and its strength {{at any one}} point {{is defined as the}} force (per <b>unit</b> <b>charge)</b> that would be felt by a stationary, negligible charge if placed at that point. The conceptual charge, termed a 'test charge', must be vanishingly small to prevent its own {{electric field}} disturbing the main field and must also be stationary to prevent the effect of magnetic fields. As the electric field is defined in terms of force, and force is a vector, so it follows that an electric field is also a vector, having both magnitude and direction. Specifically, it is a vector field.|$|E

In 1644 under Koniecpolski he took part in the battle of Ochmatów where Commonwealth forces dealt a crushing defeat to Toğay bey's (Tuhaj Bej) Tatars. He served as one of seven pułkowniks in Koniecpolski's army, and once again his cavalry <b>unit</b> <b>charge</b> proved to be a decisive moment of the battle, bringing him much fame.

5|$|The {{concept of}} {{electric}} potential is {{closely linked to}} that of the electric field. A small charge placed within an electric field experiences a force, and to have brought that charge to that point against the force requires work. The electric potential at any point is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test charge from an infinite distance slowly to that point. It is usually measured in volts, and one volt is the potential for which one joule of work must be expended to bring a charge of one coulomb from infinity. This definition of potential, while formal, has little practical application, and a more useful concept is that of electric potential difference, and is the energy required to move a <b>unit</b> <b>charge</b> between two specified points. An electric field has the special property that it is conservative, which means that the path taken by the test charge is irrelevant: all paths between two specified points expend the same energy, and thus a unique value for potential difference may be stated. The volt is so strongly identified as the unit of choice for measurement and description of electric potential difference that the term voltage sees greater everyday usage.|$|E
25|$|In {{a device}} without {{internal}} resistance, if an electric charge Q passes through that device, and gains an energy W, the net emf for that device is the energy gained per <b>unit</b> <b>charge,</b> or W/Q.

2500|$|In {{theoretical}} physics, Q-ball {{is a type}} of non-topological soliton. A soliton is a localized field configuration that is stable—it cannot {{spread out}} and dissipate.
