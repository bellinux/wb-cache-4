40|$|We use density {{functional}} theory (DFT) calculations {{to study}} a novel Deacon-like process over pure RuO 2 (110) and TiO 2 -supported RuO 2 (110), a commercial process which was recently introduced by Sumitomo Chemical. During the HCl oxidation reaction the surface becomes chlorinated, which makes this catalyst stable <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>harsh</b> <b>reaction</b> conditions. The reaction mechanism for the chlorination of unsupported RuO 2 (110) proceeds via water formation in the bridging position and the final replacement of this water species by chlorine. The actual HCl oxidation reaction takes place via a one-dimensional Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. The recombination of on-top chlorine atoms to form the desired product Cl 2 is identified as the rate-determining step with an activation energy Ea of 114 kJ/mol. DFT calculations predict that one monolayer of RuO 2 (110) supported on TiO 2 (110) reveals catalytic activity which is almost as high as that on the unsupported RuO 2 (110) (Ea = 124 kJ/mol). Further reduction of the Ru loading to half of a monolayer still keeps the TiO 2 (110) -RuO 2 (110) as a good catalyst for the Deacon process, with an activation barrier of the rate-determining step of 29 kJ/mol higher than at pure RuO 2 (110) ...|$|E

30|$|Carbon {{nanostructures}} {{have attracted}} extensive attentions {{due to their}} unique physicochemical properties and promising applications in nanodevices [1, 2]. One of the major challenges for nanodevice fabrication is how to immobilize the functional nanostructures on electrically conducting electrodes. Amma et al.[3] demonstrated that extremely hydrophilic carbon nanotubes (CNTs) could be immobilized on a hydrophilic Au surface by means of electrostatic interaction. However, this technique requires <b>harsh</b> chemical <b>reactions</b> (e.g. azo-coupling) to modify the CNT surface with a hydrophilic group (e.g., –SO 3 Na). <b>The</b> <b>harsh</b> <b>reaction</b> conditions and <b>the</b> bonded chemical groups may cause some changes of the intrinsic nature of the carbon nanotubes.|$|R
30|$|Nitrogen-doped {{graphene}} (N-graphene) can {{be prepared}} via direct incorporation of nitrogen atoms into graphene by means of, for example, chemical vapor deposition, arc discharge, and solvothermal processes [5 – 7] or by N-doping of initially prepared graphene oxide (graphene) under thermal, plasma, electrochemical, etc. post-treatment [8 – 11]. In the first case, the main disadvantages are <b>the</b> <b>harsh</b> <b>reaction</b> conditions, sufficiently long duration, and high cost of processes due to using of specific equipment and necessity of strict implementation of manufacturing operations. Major drawbacks of the second approach are the multistaging of process and the using of environmentally hazardous reagents.|$|R
