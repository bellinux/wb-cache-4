5|$|In {{engineering}} or household applications, {{current is}} often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative. If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this {{takes the form of a}} sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed <b>under</b> <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} step method (STM) is a computational technique {{utilized to}} estimate one-dimensional surface water profiles in open channels with {{gradually varied flow}} <b>under</b> <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> conditions. [...] It uses {{a combination of the}} energy, momentum, and continuity equations to determine water depth with a given a friction slope , channel slope , channel geometry, and also a given flow rate. [...] In practice, this technique is widely used through the computer program HEC-RAS, developed by the US Army Corps of Engineers Hydrologic Engineering Center (HEC).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Under</b> <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> flow {{conditions}} (e.g. no flood wave), {{open channel flow}} can be subdivided into three types of flow: uniform flow, gradually varying flow, and rapidly varying flow. [...] Uniform flow describes a situation where flow depth does not change with distance along the channel. [...] This can only occur in a smooth channel that does not experience any changes in flow, channel geometry, roughness or channel slope. [...] During uniform flow, the flow depth is known as normal depth (yn). [...] This depth {{is analogous to the}} terminal velocity of an object in free fall, where gravity and frictional forces are in balance (Moglen, 2013). [...] Typically, this depth is calculated using the Manning formula. [...] Gradually varied flow occurs when the change in flow depth per change in flow distance is very small. [...] In this case, hydrostatic relationships developed for uniform flow still apply. [...] Examples of this include the backwater behind an in-stream structure (e.g. dam, sluice gate, weir, etc.), when there is a constriction in the channel, and when there is a minor change in channel slope. [...] Rapidly varied flow occurs when the change in flow depth per change in flow distance is significant. In this case, hydrostatics relationships are not appropriate for analytical solutions, and continuity of momentum must be employed. [...] Examples of this include large changes in slope like a spillway, abrupt constriction/expansion of flow, or a hydraulic jump.|$|E

40|$|The {{fluctuation}} theorem (FT) quantifies {{the probability}} of Second Law of Thermodynamics violations in small systems over short timescales. While this theorem has been experimentally demonstrated for systems that are perturbed from an initial equilibrium state, {{there are a number}} of studies suggesting that the theorem applies asymptotically in the long time limit to systems in a non-equilibrium <b>steady</b> <b>state.</b> The asymptotic application of the FT to such non-equilibrium steady-states has been referred to in the literature as the steady-state fluctuation theorem (or SSFT). In 2005 Wang et aldemonstrated experimentally an integrated form of the SSFT using a colloidal bead that was weakly held in a circularly translating optical trap. Moreover, they showed that the integrated form of the FT may, for certain systems, hold <b>under</b> non-equilibrium <b>steady</b> <b>states</b> for all time, and not just in the long time limit, as suggested by the SSFT. While demonstration of the integrated forms of these theorems is compact and illustrative, a proper demonstration shows the theorem directly, rather than in its integrated form.

50|$|Free iron is {{toxic to}} cells as {{it acts as}} a {{catalyst}} {{in the formation of}} free radicals from reactive oxygen species via the Fenton Reaction. Hence vertebrates evolve an elaborate set of protective mechanisms to bind iron in various tissue compartments. Within cells, iron is stored in a protein complex as ferritin or hemosiderin. Apoferritin binds to free ferrous iron and stores it in the ferric state. As ferritin accumulates within cells of the reticuloendothelial system, protein aggregates are formed as hemosiderin. Iron in ferritin or hemosiderin can be extracted for release by the RE cells although hemosiderin is less readily available. <b>Under</b> <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> conditions, the serum ferritin level correlates with total body iron stores; thus, the serum ferritin FR5Rl is the most convenient laboratory test to estimate iron stores.|$|E

The SRF based compensation is developed by sensing load currents only, which require for harmonics and reactive power compensation due to non-linear loads. The attempt is {{to come up with}} a simple control strategy. Incidentally it is different from conventional methods and provides superior performance. The cascaded multilevel voltage source inverter switching signals are generated from proposed triangular-periodical current controller; that gives better dynamic performance <b>under</b> transient and <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> conditions. The proportional integral (PI) controller is used to maintain the capacitance voltage of the cascaded inverter almost constant.
