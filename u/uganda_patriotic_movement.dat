50|$|The <b>Uganda</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Movement</b> is a defunct {{political}} party in Uganda. It {{was founded by}} Yoweri Museveni and participated in the December 1980 general elections, which were won by Milton Obote's Uganda People's Congress. The election results were disputed, leading Museveni to form the National Resistance Movement and its military wing - the National Resistance Army - with which he waged a guerrilla rebellion against Obote's government. In 1986, Museveni became president and has been power since then.|$|E
50|$|When Binaisa {{removed the}} army Chief of Staff, Brigadier Oyite Ojok, he was himself {{removed from office}} on 12 May 1980 by the Military Commission, a {{powerful}} organ of the UNLF headed by Paulo Muwanga, and whose deputy was Yoweri Museveni (then leader of <b>Uganda</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Movement</b> and the current president of Uganda (1986-to date)). The country was then led by the Presidential Commission of Uganda (set up {{a few days after}} the coup) with among others Paulo Muwanga, Yoweri Museveni, Oyite Ojok and Tito Okello.|$|E

50|$|When {{political}} parties were being formed {{in preparation for}} the 1980 General Elections, p'Ojok vied for leadership of <b>Uganda</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Movement</b> (UPM), but Yoweri Museveni was instead chosen for the post. Akena p'Ojok then joined Uganda People's Congress (UPC), and became Member of Parliament for Gulu West Constituency, having beaten his main competitor, Anthony Ocaya of the Democratic Party. Uganda People's Congress won the elections (which were largely believed to have been rigged). Akena p'Ojok became the Minister of Power Posts and Telecommunications, and later held various positions as Cabinet Minister in the government of UPC's Milton Obote.|$|E
50|$|The UPC {{returned}} in 1979 after Idi Amin was overthrown. Obote {{as leader of}} the UPC was closely aligned to the Military Junta that had replaced Idi Amin and rather than strengthen the support of the party in the South of Uganda took up a more military approach. The army (traditionally dominated by Northerners) was a brutal machine that carried out numerous atrocities particularly in the South. This polarised the North/South divide with the UPC being perceived more as a Northern party than ever before. Southerners turned to the Democratic Party and a smaller party called the <b>Uganda</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Movement</b> (UPM) led by a former UPC member, Yoweri Museveni.|$|E
50|$|Kategaya {{was part}} of Museveni's Front for National Salvation (FRONASA), a group of Ugandan exiles in Tanzania who {{eventually}} helped topple Idi Amin in 1979 {{with the help of}} the Tanzania People's Defence Force. In 1980, he was a founder of the <b>Uganda</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Movement,</b> headed by Museveni to contest in the elections. When Museveni launched the guerrilla struggle against the Milton Obote II administration (1981 - 1985), Kategaya served in the 'External Wing' of the rebel National Resistance Movement (NRM) and National Resistance Army (NRA). The NRM transformed into the National Resistance Movement political party, while the NRA became the Uganda People's Defence Force (UPDF). He was a Brigadier General in the National Resistance Army from 1987 holding army number RO-002 although he never served in any military position as he was all the time serving in other government offices as a senior cabinet minister.|$|E

50|$|The period {{following}} the ousting of Amin {{was a time}} of intense competition and fighting for power among different groups of political and ethnic rivals. Yusuf Lule had been installed as president by Tanzania. In June 1979, following a dispute over the extent of presidential powers, the National Consultative Commission (NCC), which was then the supreme governing body of the UNLF, replaced Lule with Godfrey Binaisa. Binaisa was himself removed on 12 May 1980 by the Military Commission, a powerful organ of the UNLF headed by Paulo Muwanga and his deputy Yoweri Museveni (then leader of the <b>Uganda</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Movement).</b> A Presidential Commission with three members, Saulo Musoke, Polycarp Nyamuchoncho, and Joel Hunter Wacha-Olwol were then appointed to lead the country. They governed Uganda until the December 1980 general elections, which were won by Milton Obote's Uganda Peoples Congress. The elections were bitterly disputed. Yoweri Museveni alleged electoral fraud and declared an armed rebellion against Obote's government, plunging the country into the Ugandan Bush War.|$|E
5000|$|In 1974 he left East Africa for {{exile in}} Sweden. While in Sweden he studied {{economics}} {{and political science}} at a post-graduate level. He obtained a Swedish Fil.kand. degree from Lund University. In 1977 his maternal uncle Archbishop Janani Luwum was murdered along with two cabinet ministers, Erenayo Wilson Oryema and Charles Oboth Ofumbi. Opira {{played a key role}} in founding the UNLF and facilitating the Moshi conference that led to the fall of Idi Amin. He was therefore subsequently appointed the National Executive Secretary 1979-1980. During the 1980 General Elections he campaigned briefly as vice-chairman of the <b>Uganda</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Movement.</b> Due to conditions in Uganda and the death of his youngest son, he left once again for Sweden in September of the same year, before elections were held. He later returned to Uganda in 1985 and was appointed Chief Executive Director of the Uganda Board of Trade. He is survived by his widow [...] "mama Sammy" [...] whom he married on New Year's Eve 1955, and children.|$|E
