25|$|In chapter 1 of his work, Evans proposes for {{the first}} time a {{transitional}} Copper Age between the Neolithic and the Bronze Age. He adduces evidence from far-flung places such as China and the Americas to show that the smelting of copper universally preceded alloying with tin to make bronze. He does not know how to classify this fourth age. On the one hand he distinguishes it from the Bronze Age.

A quantitative assessment of the significance of virtually all materials to the U. K. is made. Copper is identified {{as one of the most}} important materials deserving of further investigation into potential resource savings through increased recycling. The other factors listed above are accounted for in the modelling technique employed. United Kingdom copper flows are qualitatively and statistically described for the years 1949 - 1976. Less accurate statistics are developed for 1922 - 1948. Adaptive expectations type causal models of total, <b>unalloyed,</b> and alloyed <b>copper</b> demand are successfully constructed and are used to generate future scenarios. Evidence is demonstrated for a break in the historical link between U. K. copper demand and industrial production. Simple causal models of potential copper scrap supply are constructed and a comparison made with actual old scrap withdrawals. Accurate adaptive expectations type models of total scrap demand are developed, but no conclusion is reached about the price elasticity of scrap demand. Various scenarios of copper goods demand are forecast and their effect on copper scrap demand. The potential to recover up to an extra 100. 000 tonnes/year of generally lower grade old scrap is identified. Policy options are examined and the following recommendations made: 1) A total investment of up to £ 67 million in secondary refining capacity by the year 2000 is needed. 2) The copper scrap content of copper bearing goods should be specified to aid recovery. 3) A U. K. copper scrap buffer stock scheme would be advantageous for the secondary copper industry. Finally the methodology used is summarised for potential application to other materials...|$|R

Silver hoards containing small tongueshaped bar chunks or scrapped jewellery became more and more common in the archaeological context in Israel as well as all over the Mediterranean. A similar phenomenon was evident during the Persian Period on the coast of Israel, where copper and copper-based objects were found in relatively large quantities [...] and with parallels in other sites all around the Mediterranean Sea. What could be defined as a basic Phoenician metal “kit” is composed mainly of the “Irano-Scythian” shape of three winged and socketed arrowheads made mainly of tin bronze, sometimes with arsenic and/or lead and left as-cast, and “hand”-like decorated fibulae made of good quality (7 wt%-12 wt% Sn) tin bronze and lead (up to 17 wt% Pb). They underwent mechanical treatment after casting and an extensive final cold working in the area where the needle spring was fastened into the fibulae body.

The films formed on initial exposure of the 90 – 10 copper–nickel alloy to the seawaters did not confer any additional protection relative to <b>unalloyed</b> <b>copper.</b> Indeed, the 90 – 10 copper–nickel tended to exhibit relatively high anodic and cathodic currents when directly compared to both <b>unalloyed</b> <b>copper</b> and a nickel aluminium bronze under identical conditions. The corrosion potential of the alloy becomes more negative at higher flow velocity, due to the influence of mass transport on the anodic reaction mechanism at potentials close to the mixed potential. Overall, the results indicate that the character of the freshly polished material/electrolyte interface has a much greater influence over the magnitude of the corrosion rate than the turbulence intensity of the fluid...|$|E

In this paper, we address the following points: (i) the metal sources, (ii) the fabrication process and (iii) degradation phenomena, such as incrustation and embrittlement. In this investigation, we employed energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry, and scanning electron and optical microscopies. The patina is mainly composed of chlorargirite. The coins consist of a silver-rich alloy containing similar to 1 % of Au and Cu. Metallographic and local compositional analyses revealed a complex scenario of inclusions. In one instance, <b>unalloyed</b> <b>copper</b> grains, two-phase copper/bismuth globuli and high-bismuth filaments were observed.

Grain polygonalization can occasionally be noticed, hinting at secondary recrystallization processes. The irregularly shaped iron oxide particles often act as crack initiation sites. Fracture facets are generally intergranular. On some areas, intergranular decohesion is also observed. Open cracks sometimes contain AgCl.

40|$|This report {{examines}} the degradation modes of four Ni-Cr-Mo alloys under conditions {{relevant to the}} Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project (YMP). The materials considered are Alloys C- 276, C- 4, C- 22, and 625 because they have desirable characteristics for the conceptual design (CD) of the high-level radioactive-waste containers presented in the YMP Site Characterization Plan (SCP). The types of degradation covered in this report are general corrosion; localized corrosion, including pitting and crevice corrosion; stress corrosion cracking in chloride environments; hydrogen embrittlement (HE); and undesirable phase transformations {{due to a lack}} of phase stability. Topics not specifically addressed are welding concerns and microbiological corrosion. The four Ni-Cr-Mo alloys have excellent corrosion resistance in chloride environments such as seawater as well as in more aggressive environments. They have significantly better corrosion resistance than the six materials considered for the CD waste container in the YMP SCP. (Those six materials are Types 304 L and 3161 L stainless steels, Alloy 825, <b>unalloyed</b> <b>copper,</b> Cu(70) -Ni(30), and 7 % aluminum bronze.) In seawater, the Ni-Cr-Mo alloys have negligible general corrosion rates and show little evidence of localized corrosion. The four base materials of these alloys are expected to have nearly indistinguishable corrosion resistance in the YMP environments. The strength requirements of the SCP-CD waste container are met by these materials in the annealed condition; in this condition, they are highly resistant to HE. Historically, HE has been noted when these materials have been strengthened (cold-worked) and used in sour gas (H{sub 2 }S and CO{sub 2 }) well service [...] conditions that are not expected for the YMP.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 08 In recent years, copper sulfide nanocrystals (NCs) {{have emerged}} as {{promising}} candidates for new photothermal agents due to their strong near-infrared (NIR) light absorption, high photostability, low toxicity, and suitable size for photothermal therapy. 1, 2 However, the low photothermal conversion efficiency of copper sulfide NCs in the tissue transparency window from 650 to 900 nm hinders further development of copper sulfide as an effective photothermal agent. 3, 4 Therefore, it is still necessary to improve the photothermal conversion efficiency near 800 nm for these materials to be used effectively in photothermal therapy. 4 As a result, other kinds of copper chalcogenide NCs, such as copper selenide, copper telluride, and their alloys have been recently proposed. 5, 6, 7 By changing the mix of chalcogen substituents in the NC, the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) position can be tuned to more closely match the tissue transparency window, leading to a higher photothermal conversion efficiency near the excitation wavelength. 8 Copper selenide-sulfide and copper telluride-sulfide alloy NCs are especially interesting candidate materials for photothermal agents, as they should have lower cytotoxicity than pure copper selenide and copper telluride NCs due to their reduced selenium and tellurium content. However, their potential use for photothermal therapy {{has not yet been}} evaluated in depth. Herein, the photothermal conversion efficiency of several copper chalcogenide alloy NCs were investigated to evaluate the potential use of each as a photothermal agent via a comparison with <b>unalloyed</b> <b>copper</b> sulfide NCs. By controlling the composition of the alloys, their localized surface plasmon resonance peaks could be tuned throughout the near-infrared region, potentially leading to materials with resonances more closely matched to ideal therapeutic windows. Moreover, {{it was found that the}} photothermal conversion efficiency increased relative to the copper sulfide NCs as the LSPR peaks were tuned more closely to the 808 nm laser wavelength used in this study – directly within the center of the tissue transparency window...|$|E
40|$|This {{study has}} {{demonstrated}} {{the capability of}} electrochemically assessing the metal–ion concentrations generated from the localised corrosion of nickel–aluminium bronzes (NAB). Prior to investigating NAB crevice corrosion, its electrochemical properties were studied at different pHs and chloride concentrations. At solution pHs higher than 4 NAB exhibited a corrosion behaviour {{similar to that of}} <b>unalloyed</b> <b>copper</b> and its oxidation was controlled by the dissolution of the copper–rich ?–phase. However, as the pH was decreased below 4 the corrosion mechanism changed and the other ?–phases rich in aluminium, iron and nickel underwent preferential oxidation. The NAB corrosion performance was also investigated in the presence of benzotriazole (inhibitor) by using potentiodynamic polarisation. The excellent corrosion properties showed by NAB when exposed to neutral benzotriazole solution made the studied inhibitor a promising candidate for limiting crevice corrosion. With knowledge of the NAB corrosion behaviour and the relatively high copper– and nickel–ion extents present within the crevice corrosion solutions, a study related to their electrochemical behaviour and detection was undertaken using a boron–doped diamond (BDD) electrode at different pHs and chloride levels in order to establish viable electrochemical protocols for effectively assess these concentrations. Before investigating the copper and nickel electrochemical behaviours on BDD electrode, the diamond substrate was studied using a number of different techniques such as potentiodynamic polarisation, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Results highlighted its excellent performance having a wide potential window (ca. 3 V) and a low capacitive current (20 ?F cm– 2 in 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4) available for electroanalysis purposes. Finally, the NAB crevice corrosion was monitored using a BDD microelectrode array. The employed setup created an artificial crevice and accommodated the BDD microelectrode array for in situ and a real–time monitoring. The electrochemical response showed the only presence of copper(I) during the investigated time, whose concentration increased within the first two hundred hours to a level of ca. 0. 4 mM and then remained stable for the following hundred hours. No copper(II), or other metal–ions, were determined in the crevice solutions, thus suggesting that within the investigated time the copper–rich ?–phase dominated the NAB corrosion behaviour. Furthermore, results also indicated (ii) the low dissolved oxygen concentration within the crevice (since it promotes the oxidation of copper(I) to copper(II)) and (ii) that the local pH did not decreased below 4, where the NAB corrosion is controlled by the selective dissolution of the aluminium–, iron– and nickel–rich ?–phases...|$|E
