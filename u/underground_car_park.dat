5|$|The Animals in War Memorial {{was opened}} at the {{northeast}} edge of Park Lane in 2004 by Anne, Princess Royal. It commemorates animals that served in wars, and alongside servicemen. In June 2007, a car bomb was successfully defused in an <b>underground</b> <b>car</b> <b>park</b> on Park Lane. The road was closed {{for most of the}} day for police investigation.|$|E
5|$|The square was a prestigious, high-class development, {{attracting}} the social elite. The square gradually lost its prestige status after the First World War as hotels {{started to move}} in. The square's central garden, originally private, has been council-owned since 1884 and is publicly accessible, and an <b>underground</b> <b>car</b> <b>park</b> was built beneath it in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Regency Square was a prestigious, high-class development, {{attracting}} the social elite. The square gradually lost its prestige status after World War I as hotels {{started to move}} in, and by the mid-20th century, most of the houses had become hotels. During World War II air-raid shelters were built on the square, and an <b>underground</b> <b>car</b> <b>park</b> was built beneath it in 1969.|$|E
40|$|The use {{of energy}} for {{operating}} ventilation systems in <b>underground</b> <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> in Hong Kong is considered. A site survey {{has been carried out}} in 22 <b>underground</b> <b>car</b> <b>parks.</b> The physical size, configurations, and electrical rating of ventilation fans were the main matters of interest. The indoor thermal environments, carbon monoxide concentrations, and operation of ventilation systems were examined. Mathematical expressions are developed and the predicted results examined for another 54 <b>underground</b> <b>car</b> <b>parks.</b> The results show that significant savings can be achieved if a two-level ventilation strategy is implemented.

5|$|Plans {{for a new}} {{building}} on the site have gone through several generations. The first design consisted of a six-storey building (including basement), which had a large shop on the ground floor, {{as well as an}} <b>underground</b> <b>car</b> <b>park</b> and four floors of residential apartments, with a top level to hold the building's mechanics. Each floor would have 4,000 square feet (372 m2), and {{there would have been a}} leaning tower to the side of the building. The design was given planning permission in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{recommendation}} for demolition, in late 1995, the councillors {{of the newly}} formed City of Perth had a feasibility study carried out into whether Council House could be refurbished. This feasibility study {{was carried out by}} Architects Cox Howlett and Bailey, of which one of the partners was the son of original designer Jeffrey Howlett, and cost $100,000. The study indicated that the building could be economically refurbished, and in December 1996 the Council unanimously agreed to press ahead with refurbishment plans, removing its asbestos and building an <b>underground</b> <b>car</b> <b>park</b> {{at the rear of the}} site. The decision to refurbish was helped by the fact that interest rates at the time were so low that it was cheaper to service a loan than to pay rent. At the time, the refurbishment was expected to cost around $26 million.|$|E
5|$|The {{catchment}} {{population for}} major food retail outlets in Dorchester is 38,500 (2001 estimate) and extends eight miles west, {{north and east}} of the town, and two miles south. The Brewery Square redevelopment project now includes retail outlets, residential units, bars, restaurants, hotel and cultural facilities. The regeneration of Dorchester South railway station will make it the UK's first solar powered railway station. The Charles Street development has had a first phase completed that includes a library and adult education centre for Dorset County Council, and offices for West Dorset District Council. Future phases are planned to include 23 shops, an <b>underground</b> <b>car</b> <b>park,</b> hotel and affordable housing. The second phase has attracted funding of £4 million from West Dorset District Council and includes new Marks & Spencer and Waitrose stores.|$|E

5|$|On 6 August {{the police}} removed the McCanns' hired car. Keela and Eddie {{were taken to}} an <b>underground</b> <b>car</b> <b>park</b> {{opposite}} the Polícia Judiciária headquarters in Portimão, where 11 cars were parked, 20–30 feet apart, including the McCanns' and Robert Murat's. Eddie, the cadaver dog, gave an alert outside the McCanns' car and inside the boot (trunk). Keela alerted to the map compartment in the driver's door, which contained the ignition key and key ring. When the key ring was hidden underneath sand in a fire bucket, she alerted again, as she did when the bucket was moved to a different floor of the car park. One or both dogs gave alerts at Cuddle Cat, Kate's clothes and the Bible. The McCanns' lawyer said that, if there was indeed a smell of corpses on Kate's clothes, {{it could have been}} caused by her contact with corpses as a family doctor. Almost immediately the Portuguese press began running stories that Madeleine had died inside apartment 5A.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass is {{rescued by}} a group of elderly people living in a scrap yard. At the hospital, the doctors are shocked when Isabel levitates off her bed and explodes in a cloud of dust. Elsewhere, the devastated Kapp is left alone in the ruins of his cottage and observatory. More and more young people are joining the Planet People, {{including}} the gangs that have been terrorising the cities and the soldiers assigned to keep them away from the Megalithic sites. Contact is restored with Chuck Marshall and with the Russians in the form of Gurov (Brewster Mason). Quatermass theorises {{that this is not the}} first time this has happened; megalithic sites such as prehistoric stone circles are in fact markers where beacons have been left by the alien force for its next visit. Quatermass believes the force is a sphere of energy surrounding the Earth. The Russians and the Americans send a space shuttle, commanded by Marshall, to make contact with the force. Quatermass is sceptical; he believes they are dealing not with an intelligence but with a machine constructed to harvest human protein. The space shuttle is destroyed but not before Marshall reports a giant beam of light stretching in all directions. Meanwhile, the Planet People are gathering at Wembley Stadium in the tens of thousands. Annie and Quatermass travel to the stadium but are powerless to prevent the Planet People from gathering. When they are attacked, Annie drives their car into the <b>underground</b> <b>car</b> <b>park</b> beneath the stadium where she crashes the vehicle and is killed. The lightning strikes the stadium.|$|E

50|$|Cars are {{required}} to yield to pedestrians and cyclists. In general, cars are led to large <b>underground</b> <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> in the historic centre of Kortrijk or Park&Ride parking outside the town centre. Large parts of the historic centre are car free.|$|R
25|$|The {{building}} is {{built in a}} longitudinal manner from North to South, with a central body divided into two wings, separated by a patio, thus creating a U-shaped structure, complemented by an L-shaped construction, which creates a second patio between the latter building and the main building. This patio serves as the main access to the Museum, with connection to the <b>underground</b> <b>car</b> <b>park</b> and gardens.|$|E
25|$|The V Building is a {{proposed}} 51 storey landmark residential skyscraper. It will be located next to Alpha Tower, {{one of the}} tallest buildings in Birmingham, on what is currently a multi-level <b>underground</b> <b>car</b> <b>park.</b> The {{total cost of the}} entire scheme is expected to be £400 million, and the tower, £150 million. Planning permission was granted in 2005, however developers Miller Developments and Bridgehouse Capital have been granted a five-year extension on planning permission for the V Building meaning it must be built by 2015.|$|E

40|$|Ventilation {{design for}} <b>underground</b> <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> is studied, first through a {{brief review of}} the {{ventilation}} requirement. Carbon monoxide concentration {{is believed to be the}} most important chemical species to be considered. Some results on field measurement of <b>underground</b> <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> reported in the literature are reviewed. The well-mixed model, which is a basic design model for studying the transient variation of carbon monoxide concentration, is described. The model is then revised to describe multiple sources of emission for several cars staying in a <b>car</b> <b>park</b> with their internal combustion engines operating. Two mixing models proposed by Sandberg 1981) -Model 1, based on a displacement ventilation system and Model 3, based on a ventilation system with a short-circuiting air flow path-are applied to study the ventilation design in <b>car</b> <b>parks.</b> The technique of computational fluid dynamics is used to verify those existing models and then to compute the mixing factors concerned. Key system performance parameters are calculated, and a set of graphs relating those system performance parameters with the input design data is presented. These graphs can be used for designing the required ventilation rate for the system under different carbon monoxide loads. Eight local <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> are surveyed to illustrate the application of the model. Field measurement data on <b>underground</b> <b>car</b> <b>parks,</b> as described above, are reviewed and applied to justify the mixing models. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
25|$|The centre was {{the result}} of many design iterations, some of them being {{substantially}} larger and including an underground bus terminal and a large <b>underground</b> <b>car</b> <b>park.</b> Political concerns and cost implications meant that those concepts did not proceed. However, {{at the time of its}} inception in the early 2000s the centre was still Auckland's largest transport project ever, built to move rail access closer to the city's CBD and help boost Auckland's low usage of public transport. It is one of the few underground railway stations in the world designed for use by diesel trains.|$|E
25|$|Especially in densely {{built-up}} inner-city areas smaller {{parks are}} highly {{important for the}} inhabitants of Linz, the parks act as green oases. Along the main axis of the city centre of Linz, the highway, several such small gardens are located. These are on the one handside the Landhaus Park, which has been redesigned {{as part of an}} <b>underground</b> <b>car</b> <b>park</b> construction until 2009, whereby the old trees have been preserved. In addition, Hessenplatz or – park is located in the city centre of Linz. Hessenplatz was the centre of Neustadtviertel in 1884. Just off the highway Schiller Park is located, which replaced the Trainkaserne in 1909, and the Volksgarten, which was created in 1829 by an entrepreneur and bought up in 1857 by the city.|$|E
25|$|As of 2017, {{the site}} is being redeveloped by local architects PJ Livesey as a {{residential}} area of 93 homes, with the listed buildings being retained: the former administration building will contain 19 apartments, located within the original part of the building, and 12 houses situated in the wings as mews homes; the old chapel will contain 10 apartments; the Lodge will become a house; and 801 and 803 Wilmslow Road will become houses. A further 42 houses will be newly-built, with three, four and five bedrooms, and garages and gardens. There will be seven newly-built apartments, along with an <b>underground</b> <b>car</b> <b>park.</b> The area will be known as St James Park, and a new 420-place primary school, operated by Beaver Road Primary School, will be constructed on the land previously occupied by Broomhurst Hall.|$|E
