The company had accordingly petitioned the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission for compensatory tariff hike, and later for compensatory relief.|$|E
50|$|ONGC {{was founded}} on 14 August 1956 by Government of India, which {{currently}} holds a 68.94% equity stake. It is involved in exploring for and exploiting hydrocarbons in 26 sedimentary basins of India, and owns and operates over 11,000 kilometers of pipelines in the country. Its international subsidiary ONGC Videsh currently has projects in 17 countries. ONGC has discovered 6 of the 7 commercially producing Indian Basins, in the last 50 years, adding over 7.1 billion tonnes of In-place Oil & Gas volume of hydrocarbons in Indian basins. Against a global decline of production from matured fields, ONGC has maintained production from its brownfields like Mumbai High, {{with the help of}} aggressive investments in various IOR (Improved Oil Recovery) and EOR (Enhanced Oil Recovery) schemes. ONGC has many matured fields with a current recovery factor of 25-33%. Its Reserve Replacement Ratio for between 2005 and 2013, has been more than one. During FY 2012-13, ONGC had to share the highest ever <b>under-recovery</b> of INR 494.2 billion (an increase of INR 49.6 million over the previous financial year) towards the under-recoveries of Oil Marketing Companies (IOC, BPCL and HPCL).|$|E

40|$|In {{fiscal year}} 2010 – 2011, the Government of India spent INR 43, 904 crore 2 (US$ 9. 6 billion) subsidizing retail prices of diesel, kerosene, LPG and, {{to a lesser}} extent, {{gasoline}} (TERI, 2012 b). In addition, oil companies incurred INR 37, 190 crore (US$ 8. 2 billion) worth of <b>under-recoveries,</b> of which INR 30, 297 crore (US$ 6. 6 billion) was provided by upstream national oil companies (see Box 1 for more details). In 2011 – 12 total expenditure on subsidies (including for fertilizer and food) grew by 26. 7 per cent (Government of India, 2012 b). The Union Budget 2012 – 13 attributed the deterioration of India’s fiscal balance in 2011 – 12, in large part, to this increase in subsidies (Government of India, 2012 a) and stated that this level of growth in subsidy expenditure is not sustainable (Government of India, 2012 b). The budget sets out the government’s intention to maintain total subsidies to under 2 per cent of GDP in 2012 – 13 and reducing to under 1. 75 per cent of GDP over the following three years, although food subsidies {{will continue to be}} fully provided for (Government of India, 2012 a). Policy measures, such as better targeting of subsidies and improved transparency, are planned to reduce the total subsidy bill. However, by late July 2012, it was reported that the government had already spent most of the US$ 7. 6 billion budget allocated for fuel subsidies in 2012 – 13 (Reuters, 2012), indicating that much stronger reforms are required for meeting the government’s fiscal policy objectives. 1 This policy brief is based on two reports prepared by the National Institute for Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP; authored by Mukesh Anand) and The Energy Resources Institute (TERI; authored by Kaushik Bandyopadhyay, Anomitro Chatterjee and Anmol Soni).

50|$|Economic factors {{affecting}} the unit over/under-recoveries {{for the period}} 27 February 2009 to 26 March 2009. During the period under review, the average international product prices of Petrol, Diesel and Illuminating Paraffin decreased. The average Rand/US Dollar exchange rate weakened {{when compared to the}} previous period. The average Rand/US Dollar exchange rate for the period 27 February 2009 to 26 March 2009 was 10,0655 compared to 10,0602 during the previous period. The Minister of Minerals and Energy has approved the implementation of a Single Maximum National Retail Price for Illuminating Paraffin with effect from 2 April 2003. The Single Maximum National Retail Price for Illuminating Paraffin will change on a monthly basis from the first Wednesday of each month and will also be promulgated in the Government Gazette. The Single Maximum National Retail Price with effect from 1 April 2009 to 5 May 2009 will be 581,0 c/l compared to 588,0 c/l from 4 March 2009 to 31 March 2009, that is a decrease of 7,00c/l. The Minister of Finance, in his Budget Speech on 11 February 2009, announced an increase of 23,0 c/l and 24,0 c/l in the fuel tax on petrol and diesel respectively with effect from 1 April 2009 and an increase of 17,5 c/l in the Road Accident Fund levy on petrol and diesel with effect from 1 April 2009. The maximum refinery gate price will be R4 738,06 per metric ton (262,96 c/l) for the period 1 April 2009 to 5 May 2009. Price changes are adjusted in such a manner that the over-or <b>under-recovery</b> during the prior month will be corrected in the following month. The unit over- or under-recoveries are rounded up or down to the nearest full cent so that the effect of rounding contributes to the clearing of the cumulative balance of the individual products on the slate.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{increased}} professionalization {{of adolescent}} sport and improved articulation to elite adult participation, {{the impact of}} sports such as rugby union among adolescents is under-explored. This study describes psychological stress–recovery responses relative to training loads in 106 male adolescent rugby union players. The results showed that players with the highest training and physical activity volumes during the season demonstrated more favourable recovery–stress states than moderate- and low-volume groups. Stress and <b>under-recovery</b> did not increase with increases in weekly volume when assessed across a season. When assessed more acutely during intensive competition phases, stress and <b>under-recovery</b> increased with increases in participation demands. Despite better psychological stress and recovery profiles of more elite, higher-load players, not all participants demonstrated favourable capacities to deal with stress and recovery processes. Seven participants were {{in at least two}} of three categories of highest volume, highest stress, and poorest recovery. Even {{in the absence of a}} full understanding of the impact of high-volume, high-stress, poor-recovery participation among adolescent athletes, these markers may be precursors for more deleterious outcomes such as injury, performance decrements, and overtraining. Findings support the efficacy of serially monitoring young athletes...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the analytical and clinical performance of the VIDAS® 25 -OH Vitamin D Total assay. The clinical performance of the assay was compared with four other immunoassays against the results of two different liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry methods (LC-MS/MS) standardized to NIST reference materials. Methods: VIDAS® 25 -OH Vitamin D Total assay precision, linearity, detection limits and sample matrix comparison were assessed following CLSI guidelines. For method comparison, a total of 150 serum samples ranging from 7 to 92 ng/mL were analyzed by all the methods. Correlation was studied using Passing-Bablok regression and Bland- Altman analysis. The concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) was calculated to evaluate agreement between immunoassays and the reference LC-MS/MS method. In addition, samples containing endogenous 25 (OH) D 2 were used to assess each immunoassay’s ability to detect this analyte. Pregnancy and hemodialysis samples were used to the study the effect of vitamin D binding protein (DBP) concentration over VIDAS® assay performance. Results: The VIDAS® 25 -OH Vitamin D Total assay showed excellent correlation to the LC-MS/MS results (y = 1. 01 x+ 0. 22 ng/mL, r = 0. 93), as obtained from two different sites and distinct LC-MS/MS methods. The limit of quantification was determined at 8. 1 ng/mL. Cross-reactivity for 25 (OH) D 2 was over 80 %. At concentrations of 10. 5, 26 and 65. 1 ng/mL, within-run CVs were 7. 9 %, 3. 6 % and 1. 7 %, while total CVs (between runs, calibrations, lots and instruments) were 16. 0 %, 4. 5 % and 2. 8 %. The VIDAS® performance was not influenced by altered DBP levels, though <b>under-recovery</b> of 25 (OH) D as compared to LC-MS/ MS was observed for hemodialysis samples. Conclusions: The VIDAS® 25 -OH Vitamin D Total assay is therefore considered suitable for assessment of vitamin D status in clinical routine.

40|$|District heating (DH) {{represents}} a viable {{way to reduce}} CO 2 emissions associated with heat production. The market model for DH and specifically the introduction of wholesale competition for heat production on DH networks has been subject of discussion in North-Western Europe. This study aims to assess if the Marginal Pricing Mechanism (MPM), as used in liberalized “energy only” electricity markets, would be an adequate pricing mechanism for a such a market. It does so by addressing the concerns related to the <b>under-recovery</b> of fixed costs for producers when solely relying on the heat market revenues. This will be done by modelling a competitive wholesale DH market including multiple heat production technologies with a linear programming based model for {{a case study in}} the Netherlands. The model incorporates supply and demand for heat to obtain an hourly dispatch and heat market prices. Subsequently, the degree to which producers can recover their fixed cost with income from the heat market revenues is assessed. The results show that only a waste incineration plant can recover its fixed cost with heat market revenues. This suggests additional remuneration is required for the other producers to sustain such a market. The MPM could on the long run enable time-dependent pricing for end users of heat and offer the opportunity for demand side management. However, the results show that the maximum variability in end user prices amounts to 11 - 24 % for the residential sector and 22 - 48 % for the horticulture sector. Although, the actual observed price variation {{over the course of a}} day is considerably less, which diminishes the potential for demand side management. Nevertheless, it can be argued that the MPM ensures the most cost efficient dispatch by minimizing operational costs, given a certain generation mix. Finally, the analysis provides insight into issues that should be taken into account by policy makers when designing a market model for a competitive DH market...|$|E
40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{understand}} the phenomenon of faculty involvement in indirect cost <b>under-recovery.</b> The focus {{of the study was}} on public research university STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) faculty, and their perspectives on, and behavior towards, a higher education fiscal policy. The explanatory scheme was derived from anthropological theory, and incorporated organizational culture, faculty socialization, and political bargaining models in the conceptual framework. This study drew on two key assumptions. The first assumption was that faculty understanding of, and behavior toward, indirect cost recovery represents values, beliefs, and choices drawn from the distinct professional socialization and distinct culture of faculty. The second assumption was that when faculty and institutional administrators are in conflict over indirect cost recovery, the resultant formal administrative decision comes about through political bargaining over critical resources. The research design was a single site, qualitative case study with a focus on learning the meaning of the phenomenon as understood by the informants. In this study the informants were tenured and tenure track research university faculty in the STEM fields who were highly successful at obtaining Federal sponsored research funds, with individual sponsored research portfolios of at least one million dollars. The data consisted of 11 informant interviews, bolstered by documentary evidence. The findings indicated that faculty socialization and organizational culture were the most dominant themes, while political bargaining emerged as significantly less prominent. Public research university STEM faculty are most concerned about the survival of their research programs and the discovery facilitated by their research programs. They resort to conjecture when confronted by the issue of indirect cost recovery. The findings direct institutional administrators to consider less emphasis on compliance and hierarchy when working with expert professionals such as science faculty. Instead a more effective focus might be on communication and clarity in budget processes and organizational decision-making, and a concentration on critical administrative support that can relieve faculty administrative burdens. For higher education researchers, the findings suggest that we need to create more sophisticated models to help us understand organizations dependent on expert professionals...|$|E
40|$|Water is {{undoubtedly}} one of South Africa’s most valuable resources. Without {{significant improvement in}} the efficiency of use of this resource, we may experience wide-ranging shortages throughout the country within the not too distant future. The educational sector in South Africa could play {{a pivotal role in}} the education of learners and their communities, relating to the responsible use of water. This education, however, requires a parallel demonstration of these values within the boundaries of the school yard in order to maintain credibility amongst those being taught, and to enjoy the financial and environmental benefits of water saving initiatives. Primary and Secondary Schools in South Africa currently accommodate approximately 11, 6 million learners and 360, 000 educators. These learners and educators are accommodated in 27, 200 schools, of which approximately 19, 600 urban schools are supplied with water on site. Included in these schools are approximately 75, 000 hostel beds, with supporting infrastructure such as canteens and laundry facilities. Other water uses within these schools include 63, 700 sports facilities for various sports codes such as swimming, rugby, soccer, hockey, athletics, cricket and volleyball. Specialist laboratories, home economics and science centres total approximately 3, 400. (National Department of Education, 2001, Schools Register of Needs). This portfolio of facilities represents a major water use within South Africa, costing schools and the Department of Education, approximately R 216 m per annum, plus estimated losses, due to leakage and wastage of approximately R 74 m per annum. This study has also shown that billing <b>under-recovery</b> to local supply authorities, providing water to schools, amounts to approximately R 90 m per annum. Based on cursory audits of 64 schools in Gauteng North, as well as their utility service provider accounts, this project sets about defining key performance indicators for use by schools to assist with the management of their water resource use. A simplified, paper-based water use simulation tool is developed for use by schools nationally, in establishing an ethic of measuring and monitoring within their institutions. School water use is fragmented, at facility level, into various major uses, including ablution consumption, irrigation of sports fields and landscaping, other ancillary uses and water losses, due to leakage and wastage. This project outlines the impacts, financial and environmental, of school water efficiency initiatives, illustrating technology options using life-cycle costing studies, and desktop simulations.
