Thus, a different relationship to predict body fat would be required for each sex.

Testicular samples were collected, after evisceration, processed and embedded in paraffine wax. Sections were stained for morphological observations, observed with light microscope, and then classified according to the testis maturation stage. Ermellinata di Rovigo chickens showed the lowest (P< 0. 01) body weight and the highest (P< 0. 01) testes weight; testes maturity was higher (P< 0. 01) in ER than in RL, whereas RM was intermediate.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine the effect of the use of Natuzyme in feed containing non-starch polysaccharides on the quality of chicken meat. Materials used were 71 native hens of 18 week-old. The experiment was conducted using Completely Randomized Design (CRD), 3 x 3 factorial pattern. Each treatment was repeated three times and was tested further with Duncan t test. The first treatment was the use of non-starch polysaccharides (R) with the levels of 0, 5 and 10 %. The second treatment was the use of Natuzyme (S) with the levels of 0, 0. 1 and 0. 2 %. The variables measured were: energy consumption, fat consumption, carcass weight, meat glycogen, meat fat, and cholesterol of meat. The results showed that the treatments did not significantly affect energy consumption, fat consumption, carcass weight and fat content of meat. The use of non-starch polysaccharides did not significantly affect the levels of meat glycogen, while the use of Natuzyme significantly affected the levels of meat cholesterol. The conclusion is that the Natuzyme only works on feedstuffs, not in the chicken digestive tract. The sources of non-starch polysaccharide in feedstuffs can be used as an energy source for <b>chickens</b> <b>until</b> a level of 10 %.

The experiment was carried out without segregation between the genders. The chickens were randomly divided into 4 groups. The control group was fed a basal diet, whereas the other three groups were fed diets supplemented with natural additives, i. e. bee pollen extract at level of 400 mg. kg - 1 of feed mixture, propolis extract at level of 400 mg. kg - 1 of feed mixture, and probiotic preparation based on Lactobacillus fermentum (1. 10 9 CFU per 1 g of bearing medium) in an amount of 3. 3 g added to water (for 30 pcs <b>chickens</b> <b>until</b> 21 days of age, for 20 pcs chickens from 22 nd to 42 nd day of age) given to group E 1, group E 2 and group E 3, respectively.

The following technological properties were examined: cooling loss (after 24 h of storage at 4 °C), freezing loss (after 3 months of storage at - 18 °C), roasting loss (performed on roasted meat that was stored at - 18 °C for 3 months before thawing), colour parameters based on CIELab system (the L*, a*, b* values of raw breast and thigh muscle), and tenderness (as shear force of roasted breast and thigh muscle). We have made a finding, that the examined additives had only little impact on meat quality in most of the investigated parameters, except the significant increase (p ≤ 0. 05) in redness (a*) values and the slight decrease in roasting loss and shear force determination after propolis extract supplementation.

Nutrient restriction was achieved by feeding a starter diet (CP 21. 5 % and ME 3, 050 kcal/kg) in which the major ingredients were replaced with 25 % or 50 % of soybean hulls. Four treatments involved feeding the diluted diets for seven days (7 - 14 days of age), either continuous or split into periods with the undiluted diet (control). The treatments were: T 1 : control diet; T 2 and T 3 : diluted diet (25 % and 50 % of soybean hulls, respectively) 7 - 14 days; T 4 and T 5 : diluted diet (25 % and 50 % of soybean hulls, respectively) on days 7, 9, 11 and 13 alternating with T 1 (on days 8, 10 and 12). The birds fed with diluted diets exhibited lower mean body weights (P< 0. 05) than controls. Feed conversion ratios from 0 - 42 days of age for restricted broilers were not different. Varying the period of nutrient restriction did not affect adversely body weight and body weight gain. There was no statistical difference in the overall mortality through 0 - 42 days among the dietary treatments. Compensatory growth was not observed, and this result could be associated with the pattern of growth curve exhibited by the hybrids used in this experiment...|$|R
