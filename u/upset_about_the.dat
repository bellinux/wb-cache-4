He {{believed}} that money was essential for his survival and {{to look after the}} family, and that the money he earned from giving music lessons and his compositions for the film world sufficed. He valued honesty and sincerity in his work and placed importance on purity and originality, whether in his music, lyrics or style of singing.

5|$|Theophilus {{first tried}} to work with Highmore and asked to run the {{operations}} of the theatre. However, he was turned down, which provoked him to stir the actors into a rebellion. Many of the actors were <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> management changes and theatre's operations. Highmore did not have experience in theatre, refused to listen to actors' ideas, and cut their salaries in half. Theophilus was known as a successful manager and a good actor. The rebellious actors' plan was to take over the lease and then deny the use of the building to the shareholders, who did not own the complex that they set their stage in. The actors would then use their control over the building to negotiate renting of the patent so they could control how the theatre was run.|$|E
5|$|Obama's {{inaugural address}} {{received}} mixed reviews, with some describing {{the tone of}} the speech a praiseworthy one of restraint and plain speaking, while others described the speech as low-brow and cliched. Despite his optimism, Obama was critical of former Presidents GeorgeW. Bush and BillClinton. David E. Sanger, chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times, described the speech as the harshest rebuke of an outgoing President during an inaugural address since Franklin Roosevelt's call for restoration of American values. The Bush administration was <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> tone of the speech, saying that the speech veered from that of a ritualistic but respectful thanks to that of a public diatribe. Members of the Republican party viewed the speech as a missed chance to seek unity, while Rahm Emanuel, Obama's White House Chief of Staff, described the speech as a reflection of the mandate of the people. In an analysis of the inaugural address, one reporter described the speech as one that emphasized the burdens of the moment and the cloudy future whose challenges may be met with the resolve that is part of our American heritage.|$|E

5000|$|An {{adjective}} phrase (or adjectival phrase) is {{a phrase}} whose head word is an adjective, e.g. fond of steak, very happy, quite <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> it, etc. <b>The</b> adjective in an adjective phrase can initiate the phrase (e.g. fond of steak), conclude the phrase (e.g. very happy), or {{appear in a}} medial position (e.g. quite <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> it). <b>The</b> dependents of the head adjective—i.e. the other words and phrases inside the adjective phrase—are typically adverbs or prepositional phrases, {{but they can also}} be clauses (e.g. louder than you do). Adjectives and adjective phrases function in two basic ways in clauses, either attributively or predicatively. When they are attributive, they appear inside a noun phrase and modify that noun phrase, and when they are predicative, they appear outside the noun phrase that they modify and typically follow a linking verb ...|$|R

25|$|Reaction to U.S. {{involvement}} was mixed. It was well received by physicians and civilians at the scene. In {{stark contrast to}} this support, IRNA, the state-controlled radio in Iran, accused the United States of illegal interference in internal matters. Khatami, while not criticizing U.S. aid, was <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> politicization of it. Interior Minister Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari supported U.S. assistance but not Israeli help, as he considered it an illegitimate government.|$|E

25|$|Regardless of {{the success}} that Parker and Presley had achieved, Parker was still {{struggling}} to believe that Presley's career would last longer than a year or two. He had seen many acts come and go during his earlier years in management, and felt that to think that Presley, despite being Parker's most successful act to date, would be any different, was foolish. In January 1958 Presley received his draft notice from the United States Army. He was <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> possibility of it affecting his career, but Parker was secretly overjoyed. Presley had been showing signs of rebellion against him recently, and Parker believed that {{a stint in the}} Army would cure him of this.|$|E
25|$|High schools {{named for}} Forrest {{were built in}} Chapel Hill, Tennessee, and Jacksonville, Florida. In 2008 the Duval County School Board voted 5–2 against a push to {{change the name of}} Nathan Bedford Forrest High School in Jacksonville. In 2013, the board voted 7-0 to begin the process to rename the school. The school was named for Forrest in 1959 at the urging of the Daughters of the Confederacy because they were <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision. At the time the school was all white, but now more than half the student body is black. After several public forums and discussions, Westside High School was {{unanimously}} approved in January 2014 as the school's new name.|$|E

The feud became part of a civil suit in which the judge, a long time friend of the General, ruled in his favor. Mysteriously, the Jonathan's barn was burned down, and no one ever claimed responsibility. He expressed that he was more <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> losing <b>the</b> animals than losing the barn itself, which could be re-built.|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} {{criticism}} {{with regards to}} the size of the new subsidized housing units built. Most of the units are smaller than the predecessor units were. This design adversely affected large families, and it has made the displacement of the people even more problematic.

50|$|The script won $10,000 in a {{competition}} by the New South Wales Film Corporation for best original quality. Angela Punch McGregor later claimed that:It {{was an excellent}} script. It was then mutilated by all of us. Writer Donald McDonald was very <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> it. <b>The</b> film was badly handled and I was miscast but I took it because I wanted the challenge of doing a comedy, which I hadn't done before. I thought my role was well written and wasn't cardboard... The director wasn't up to it, the film was miscast, the budget wasn't good.|$|R
25|$|Only {{the third}} {{approach}} promotes well-being. It is employed by resilient people, who become <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> disruptive state and thus change their current pattern {{to cope with}} the issue. The first and second approaches lead people to adopt the victim role by blaming others and rejecting any coping methods even after the crisis is over. These people prefer to instinctively react, rather than respond to the situation. Those who respond to the adverse conditions by adapting themselves tend to cope, spring back, and halt the crisis. Negative emotions involve fear, anger, anxiety, distress, helplessness, and hopelessness which decrease a person's ability to solve the problems they face and weaken a person's resiliency. Constant fears and worries weaken people's immune system and increase their vulnerability to illnesses.|$|E
25|$|On November 13, 1905, Richards and Comstock were {{sentence}}d to the custody of a United States Marshal for six hours and a fine of $300 and half of court costs. The modest sentence may have reflected a finding {{that they did not}} intimidate settlers and that their employees were at work removing the fences. Controversially, newspaper accounts charged that Richards and Comstock took part in a victory celebration instead of serving time. The Secretary of the Interior was <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> news and fired District Attorney Baxter and Marshal Thomas L. Mathews, the officer in charge of Richards and Comstock's six-hour sentence. In reality, during their sentence, Richards and Comstock returned to the hotel to pack, write letters, shop, eat dinner, and arrive at the train station for the 11 p.m. train to Ellsworth.|$|E
25|$|Negative {{criticism}} of Mann's works {{is not hard}} to find. One of her detractors, Pat Robertson of the Christian Broadcasting Network, has said that “selling photographs of children in their nakedness for profit is an exploitation of the parental role and I think it’s wrong.” He views such work as a violation of the responsibility of parents to do everything in their power to protect, shelter, and nurture their children. More negative criticism came from Raymond Sokolov’s article Critique: Censoring Virginia in the Wall Street Journal. He questioned whether children should be photographed nude and whether federal funds should be appropriated for such artworks. Accompanying his article was a modified image by Mann of her daughter Virginia (Virginia at 4), in which her eyes, nipples, and pubic region were now covered with black bars. Mann said he used the image without permission “to illustrate that {{this is the kind of}} thing that shouldn’t be shown.” She was devastated and insulted that someone could mutilate her photograph that way. Virginia was also <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> article. She wrote a letter to the author saying “Dear Sir, I don’t like the way you crossed me out.” Mann said that after Virginia saw the article, she started touching herself on the areas that were blacked out, saying, “what’s wrong with me?” It was somewhat difficult for Mann to understand the harsh {{criticism of}} these photographs, for she did not stage these moments — instead when she saw a photo opportunity unfolding, she simply asked her children stop moving until she could capture it. When Mann was young, she was often nude, so she raised her children similarly.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{receiving}} {{more votes}} both in absolute and in percentage terms than his 1994 campaign, Chen lost this position in 1998 to the KMT's Ma Ying-jeou {{in large part}} because the KMT was able to gain the support of New Party supporters. In his first autobiography, [...] "The Son of Taiwan", Chen wrote that he was not entirely <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> losing <b>the</b> reelection as it gave him opportunity to find out what areas in his political career he could improve. For example, he wrote that Mainlanders generally approved of his social and economic improvements in Taipei, but they ultimately voted for Ma because of ethnic tensions.|$|R
