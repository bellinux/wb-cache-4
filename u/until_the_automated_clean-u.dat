50|$|Some 26 {{months after}} the Earth Return Vehicle is {{originally}} launched from Earth, a second vehicle, the Mars Habitat Unit, would be launched on a 6-month long low-energy transfer trajectory to Mars, and would carry a crew of four astronauts (the minimum number required so that the team can be split in two without leaving anyone alone). The Habitat Unit would not be launched <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>automated</b> factory aboard <b>the</b> ERV had signaled the successful production of chemicals required for operation on the planet and the return trip to Earth. During the trip, artificial gravity would be generated by tethering the Habitat Unit to the spent upper stage of the booster, and setting them rotating about a common axis. This rotation would produce a comfortable 1 g working environment for the astronauts, freeing them of the debilitating effects of long-term exposure to weightlessness.|$|R

[...] Built from locally quarried stone, the lighthouse was manned by a superintendent <b>until</b> <b>the</b> light was <b>automated</b> in <b>the</b> 1920s.

[...] The originally proposed inland rail route from Wairoa to Gisborne was abandoned, and by 1942 the Wairoa - Waikokopu section was incorporated into the Palmerston North - Gisborne line. Easy transport to Gisborne and Napier via rail gave Wairoa access to superior port facilities, and Waikokopu reverted to a small fishing establishment and a base for servicing the lighthouse on Portland Island, off {{the south end of}} <b>the</b> Mahia Peninsula, <b>until</b> <b>the</b> light was <b>automated</b> in 1984.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station was}} owned by the Southern Minnesota Broadcasting Company, along with other {{properties}} in the area, but they were sold to Cumulus Media in December 2003.

2500|$|Concourse E also {{dates back}} to the terminal's 1959 opening, and was {{originally}} known as Concourse 4. From the start, it was the airport's only international concourse, containing its own immigration and customs facilities. In the mid-1960s it underwent renovations similar to the airport's other original concourses, but didn't receive its first major addition <b>until</b> <b>the</b> opening of the International Satellite Terminal in 1976. Featuring Gates E20–E35 (commonly known as [...] "High E"), the satellite added 12 international gates capable of handling the largest jet aircraft as well as an international intransit lounge for arriving international passengers connecting to other international flights. The concourse and its satellite were briefly linked by buses <b>until</b> <b>the</b> airport's first <b>automated</b> people mover (Adtranz C-100) opened in 1980. At the same time Concourse E's immigration and customs facilities were radically overhauled and expanded.

5000|$|After {{the first}} phase of {{clearances}} the population of Rona rose steadily to over 180, the main settlements being at Doire na Guaileadhin the south, An Acarsaid Mhór and An Acarsaid Thioram. Many of the residents were crofting families who had themselves been cleared from more fertile land on Raasay. In May 1921, a group of crofters from Rona landed on Raasay and attempted to re-occupy their ancestral land. These so-called [...] "Raasay Raiders" [...] were arrested, tried and given jail sentences, but public support for them was strong and they were eventually freed and allowed to remain on Raasay. This led in 1922 to the acquisition of both Rona and Raasay from their private landlord by the British Government. After this, the population of Rona fell sharply, as most of the island's inhabitants followed the Raiders to settle on Raasay. In 1943 the last crofting family left and the island had become uninhabited, {{with the exception of the}} lighthouse keepers who lived at its north end <b>until</b> <b>the</b> lighthouse was <b>automated</b> in 1975.|$|R
