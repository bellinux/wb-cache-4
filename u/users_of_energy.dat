Programs directed at consumer electronics have stimulated manufacturers to cut standby power use in many products. It is probably technically feasible to reduce standby power by 75% overall; most savings will be less than a watt, but other cases will be as large as 10 watts.|$|E

Our method extends standard underwriting practices, which account for the expected dynamics of interest rates and office building prices over time, by including the expected dynamics of the electricity and gas prices as well as quantity dynamics appropriate to the location of the building. This allows lenders to explicitly take into account the effect of energy use and various alternative efficiency measures when underwriting commercial mortgages...|$|E

This paper reviews the resources, production and utilisation technology available for a hydrogen economy in Australia, and discusses some of the advantages and disadvantages of the different options. It points out that coal, natural gas, biomass and water are the most promising hydrogen sources at this stage, while solid oxide and molten carbonate fuel cells may hold the advantage in terms of current expertise for utilising hydrogen rich gases for stationary power in Australia.
