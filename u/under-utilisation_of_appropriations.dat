When the machine is operable, it produces at a rate α greater than the demand rate β, until the inventory becomes full and thereafter it produces at the demand rate. This stepping down of the rate of production results in the <b>under-utilisation</b> <b>of</b> the machine. The <b>under-utilisation</b> <b>of</b> the machine and the demand not met are analysed; special cases are considered. Cost analysis is also indicated...|$|R

30|$|The {{results of}} our {{analyses}} suggest that an <b>under-utilisation</b> <b>of</b> problem solving capabilities in the acquisition of science literacy is linked to lower levels of math-science coherence, which ultimately leads to lower scores in problem solving competence. This interpretation finds resonance in Ross and Hogaboam-Gray’s ([1998]) argumentation for integrating math and science education and supports the attempts of math and science educators to incorporate higher-order thinking skills in teaching STEM subjects (e.g., Gallagher et al.

40|$|This thesis studies {{contemporary}} poetry’s {{innovations in}} textual borrowing {{and the range}} and scope of its appropriative practices. The restrictions of the inherited definitions <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> include a limited capacity for expression and meaningfulness, a partial concept of appropriation’s critical capacity, and an inadequate sense of the poet’s individual and unique practice <b>of</b> <b>appropriation.</b> This thesis resolves the problematic constraints limiting contemporary definitions <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> by tracing {{the history of the}} practice to reveal an enduring relation between appropriation and poetic expression. Close readings of Trevor Joyce’s, Alan Halsey’s, and Susan Howe’s poetry serve as evidence of contemporary poetry’s development <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> beyond the current ascriptions and offer some direction on how the critical understanding <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> might be extended and redefined. Here, appropriation is recognized as another source of lyric expression, critical innovation, and conceptual development in contemporary poetry. This thesis encourages a new perspective on the purpose and processes <b>of</b> poetic <b>appropriation</b> and the consequences of its declarative potential for both poet and poem...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} educational {{waste in}} the Punjab Public Schools. The paper focuses upon three areas: schools’ internal efficiency, school capacity utilisation and student teacher ratio. By using cohort analysis technique, the paper measures waste in flows {{of students in the}} education cycle. The results show that repetition and dropout are more prevalent in class I and middle school classes. This implies that after having studied for five to six years in schools, a student finds themselves in a blind alley, not knowing where it all would end up. This also suggests that majority of the schools are located at large distance from the most {{of the population of the}} Punjab and students have to travel long distance for attending the schools. The <b>under-utilisation</b> <b>of</b> school capacity is more prevalent in rural area than that of urban areas and girls schools are more under-utilised than the boys schools. The under-utilisation is more widespread in boys schools of urban areas than the girls schools located in same vicinity and girls school in rural areas are more under-utilised than the boys schools. The pervasive theme emerged from results is that girls schools and teachers are mostly under-utilised. This reflects that disadvantage that girls face in Pakistan which may also cause <b>under-utilisation</b> <b>of</b> girls schools. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{introduces}} the notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in debates {{on how to}} account for migrants’ capacity to defy restrictive border controls and migration policies. What the notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> better captures than concepts like agency or resistance is the multi-faceted and intricate intertwinement of border regimes and migratory practices. The article illustrates this advantage through {{an analysis of the}} phenomenon of bezness. The term refers to a migration strategy of aspiring migrants who seduce and subsequently marry European tourists as a way to gain entry to and residency in Europe. This article develops a reading of bezness as a mode <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> mobility which is intertwined with the border regime in at least four ways: First, bezness is provoked by restrictive visa policies that create a highly unequal access to mobility and life opportunities. The case of bezness illustrates, second, that migrants try to recode the methods, logics and effects of mobility control into means <b>of</b> <b>appropriation.</b> Migrants’ practices <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> involve, third, the clandestine transgression of the norms, rules and regulations that define particular border regimes. Finally, the notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> permits to recognise that the European border regime operates as an apparatus of capture that tries to recuperate migrants’ practices in order to turn them into a driving force for its own development. The example of bezness demonstrates, moreover, that these processes of recuperation also feature the mobilisation of emotions – in this case of romantic love – as technologies of government...|$|R

40|$|According to Locke, {{appropriation}} is {{a precondition}} for moral responsibility and thus we can expect that it plays a distinctive role in his theory. Yet it is rare to find an interpretation of Locke’s account <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> that does not associate it with serious problems. To {{make room for a}} more satisfying understanding of Locke’s account <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> we have to analyse why it was so widely misunderstood. The aim of this paper is fourfold: First, I will show that Mackie’s and Winkler’s interpretations that have shaped the subsequent discussion contain serious flaws. Second, I will argue that the so-called appropriation interpretation —that is the view that appropriation is meant to provide alternative persistence conditions for persons—lacks support. Third, I will re-examine Locke’s texts and argue that we can come {{to a better understanding of}} his notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in the Essay if we interpret it in analogy to his account <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in Two Treatises. Fourth, I will offer a more fine-grained interpretation of the role <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in relation to persistence conditions for persons.
