25|$|When the {{deliverable}} asset {{exists in}} plentiful supply, {{or may be}} freely created, then {{the price of a}} futures contract is determined via arbitrage arguments. This is typical for stock index futures, treasury bond futures, and futures on physical commodities when they are in supply (e.g. agricultural crops after the harvest). However, when the deliverable commodity is not in plentiful supply or when it does not yet exist - for example on crops before the harvest or on Eurodollar Futures or Federal funds rate futures (in which the supposed <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> is to be created upon the delivery date) - the futures price cannot be fixed by arbitrage. In this scenario there is only one force setting the price, which is simple supply and demand for the asset in the future, as expressed by supply and demand for the futures contract.|$|E

This can also be measured in standard deviations, measuring how far above or below the strike price the current price is, in terms of volatility; this quantity is given by d2. (Standard deviations refer to the price fluctuations of the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument,</b> not of the option itself.) Another measure closely related to moneyness is the Delta of a call or put option. There are other proxies for moneyness, with convention depending on market.|$|E
50|$|An {{investor}} typically 'buys a call' when {{he expects}} {{the price of the}} <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> will go above the call's 'strike price,' hopefully significantly so, before the call expires. The investor pays a non-refundable premium for the legal right to exercise the call at the strike price, meaning he can purchase the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> at the strike price. Typically, if the price of the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> has surpassed the strike price, the buyer pays the strike price to actually purchase the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument,</b> and then sells the instrument and pockets the profit. Of course, the investor can also hold onto the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument,</b> if he feels it will continue to climb even higher.|$|E
5000|$|Easy {{to create}} new instruments, not {{restricted}} to exchange definitions or jurisdictional boundaries, very wide selection of <b>underlying</b> <b>instruments</b> can be traded.|$|R
5000|$|Delta, , {{measures}} {{the rate of}} change of the theoretical option value with respect to changes in the underlying asset's price. Delta is the first derivative of the value [...] of the option with respect to the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument's</b> price [...]|$|R
50|$|For example, an intermarket spread trade {{might involve}} buying a {{contract}} for West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil (on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange) while selling {{a contract for}} Brent Crude Oil (traded on the Intercontinental Exchange). The trade would gain or lose value based on the relative {{difference between the two}} <b>underlying</b> <b>instruments,</b> rather than the outright price.|$|R
50|$|An {{investor}} typically 'writes a call' when {{he expects}} {{the price of the}} <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> to stay below the call's strike price. The writer (seller) receives the premium up front as his or her profit. However, if the call buyer decides to exercise his option to buy, then the writer has the obligation to sell the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> at the strike price. Often the writer of the call does not actually own the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument,</b> and must purchase it on the open market {{in order to be able}} to sell it to the buyer of the call. The seller of the call will lose the difference between his purchase price of the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> and the strike price. This risk can be huge if the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> skyrockets unexpectedly in price.|$|E
50|$|The {{strike price}} {{is a key}} {{variable}} in a derivatives contract between two parties. Where the contract requires delivery of the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument,</b> the trade {{will be at the}} strike price, regardless of the market price of the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> at that time.|$|E
50|$|Going long in {{a future}} means the holder of the {{position}} is obliged to buy the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> at the contract price at expiry. The holder of the position will profit {{if the price of}} the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> goes up, as the price at the contract was lower.|$|E
25|$|Delta-hedging {{mitigates}} {{the financial}} risk of an option by hedging against price {{changes in its}} underlying. It is called like that as Delta is the first derivative of the option's value {{with respect to the}} <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument's</b> price. This is performed in practice by buying a derivative with an inverse price movement. It is also a type of market neutral strategy.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this review}} paper we {{summarise}} several nonparametric methods recently {{applied to the}} pricing of financial options. After a short introduction to martingale-based option pricing theory, we focus on two possible fields of application for nonparametric methods: the estimation of risk-neutral probabilities and the estimation {{of the dynamics of}} the <b>underlying</b> <b>instruments</b> in order to construct an internally consistent model...|$|R
5000|$|A {{synthetic}} position can {{be created}} by buying or selling the <b>underlying</b> financial <b>instruments</b> and/or derivatives.|$|R
5000|$|A {{covered call}} is a {{financial}} market transaction {{in which the}} seller of call options owns the corresponding amount of the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument,</b> such as shares of a stock or other securities. If a trader buys the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> {{at the same time}} the trader sells the call, the strategy is often called a [...] "buy-write" [...] strategy. In equilibrium, the strategy has the same payoffs as writing a put option.|$|E
5000|$|Volatility: The more {{volatile}} the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument,</b> {{the higher the}} price of the warrant will be (as the warrant is more likely to end up in-the-money).|$|E
50|$|Futures are {{preferred}} by professionals for indices and interest rate trading over CFDs {{as they are}} a mature product and are exchange traded. The main advantages of CFDs, compared to futures, is that contract sizes are smaller making it more accessible for small trader and pricing is more transparent. Futures contracts tend to only converge near to the expiry date compared {{to the price of}} the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> which does not occur on the CFD as it never expires and simply mirrors the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A long iron {{butterfly}} is {{very similar}} to a long iron condor, except that the inner, short strikes are at the same strike. The iron butterfly requires the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument's</b> spot price to remain virtually unchanged {{over the life of the}} contract in order to retain the full net credit, but the trade is potentially more profitable (larger net credit) than an Iron Condor.|$|R
5000|$|A short {{strangle}} is effectively a long iron condor, {{but without the}} wings. It is constructed by writing an out-of-the-money put and an out-of-the money call. A {{short strangle}} with the same short strikes as an iron condor is generally more profitable, but unlike a long iron condor, the short strangle offers no protection to limit losses should the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument's</b> spot price change dramatically.|$|R
50|$|Unlike normal warrants, {{they are}} usually issued by {{financial}} institutions instead of share-issuing companies and are listed as fully tradable securities {{on a number of}} stock exchanges. They can also have a variety of <b>underlying</b> <b>instruments,</b> not just equities, and may allow the holder to buy or sell the underlying asset. These attributes make it possible to use covered warrants as a tool to speculate on financial markets.|$|R
5000|$|A {{binary option}} (also {{known as a}} digital option) pays a fixed amount, or nothing at all, {{depending}} {{on the price of}} the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> at maturity.|$|E
50|$|An {{asset class}} {{is a group}} of {{instruments}} which have similar financial characteristics and behave similarly in the marketplace. We can often break these instruments into those having to do with real assets and those having to do with financial assets. Often, assets within the same asset class are subject to the same laws and regulations; however, this is not always true. For instance, futures on an asset are often considered part of the same asset class as the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> but are subject to different regulations than the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{price of}} the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument,</b> in {{whatever}} form, is paid before control of the instrument changes. This {{is one of the}} many forms of buy/sell orders where the time and date of trade is not the same as the value date where the securities themselves are exchanged. Forwards, like other derivative securities, can be used to hedge risk (typically currency or exchange rate risk), as a means of speculation, or to allow a party to take advantage of a quality of the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> which is time-sensitive.|$|E
5000|$|Day {{trading is}} {{considered}} akin to maisir. Marketable securities generally have a multi-day settlement period, {{during which time}} the <b>underlying</b> <b>instruments,</b> while cleared, are not formally registered {{in the name of}} the purchaser. As day traders do not wait for settlement to complete, they are using a type of credit cushion provided by their broker. [...] Some day traders also rely on a margin account to finance their trading activities.|$|R
5000|$|Covered {{warrants}} {{are very}} similar to options—much more so than [...] "traditional" [...] warrants. This is because covered warrants, just like options, can be created to allow holders to benefit from either rising prices or falling prices, by having both put and call warrants. They can also be created {{on a wide variety of}} <b>underlying</b> <b>instruments</b> not just equities and they are fairly standardised and are mostly traded on exchanges.|$|R
5000|$|Thus if we {{suppose that}} our risk-neutral {{probability}} space is [...] {{and that we}} have a derivative H that depends on a set of <b>underlying</b> <b>instruments</b> [...] Then given a sample [...] from the probability space the value of the derivative is [...] Today's value of the derivative is found by taking the expectation over all possible samples and discounting at the risk-free rate. I.e. the derivative has value: ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{lookback option}} is a path {{dependent}} option where the option owner {{has the right}} to buy (sell) the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> at its lowest (highest) price over some preceding period.|$|E
5000|$|The long {{position}} in the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> is said to provide the [...] "cover" [...] as the shares can be delivered to the buyer of the call if the buyer decides to exercise.|$|E
50|$|As for CVA, {{these results}} are modeled as a {{function}} of the risk-neutral expectation of (a) values of the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument,</b> and (b) creditworthyness of the counterparty; typically this is under a simulation framework.|$|E
5000|$|A short {{straddle}} {{is effectively}} a long iron butterfly without {{the wings and}} is constructed simply by writing an at-the-money call and an at-the-money put. Similar to a short strangle, the short straddle offers no protection to limit losses and similar to a long iron butterfly, the straddle requires the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument's</b> spot price to remain virtually unchanged {{over the life of}} the contract in order to retain the full net credit.|$|R
50|$|There {{has also}} been concern that CFDs {{are little more than}} {{gambling}} implying that most traders lose money trading CFDs. It is impossible to confirm what the average returns are from trading as no reliable statistics are available and CFD providers do not publish such information, however prices of CFDs are based on publicly available <b>underlying</b> <b>instruments</b> and odds are not stacked against traders as the CFD is simply the difference in underlying price.|$|R
40|$|Derivative {{financial}} {{products have}} experienced a huge expansion during recent years. New products are constantly appearing which seek to expand the scope of risk diversification. Because of their comparatively low transaction costs, the volumes of derivative transactions have often exceeded those of the <b>underlying</b> <b>instruments</b> that are traded in cash markets. Given the size of derivative markets, {{it is even more}} important now to understand the risk-return profiles of the different products.   JEL Codes: G 20  </p...|$|R
50|$|Compared to CFDs, {{option pricing}} {{is complex and}} has price decay when nearing expiry while CFDs prices simply mirror the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument.</b> CFDs cannot be used to reduce risk {{in the way that}} options can.|$|E
50|$|A Parisian {{option is}} a barrier option where the barrier {{condition}} applies only once {{the price of}} the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> has spent at least a given period of time {{on the wrong side of}} the barrier.|$|E
50|$|An option trader who {{considers}} a long iron condor {{is one who}} expects {{the price of the}} <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> to change very little for a significant duration of time. This trader might also consider {{one or more of the}} following strategies.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Multi-asset {{options are}} options with payoffs {{affected}} {{by at least}} two <b>underlying</b> <b>instruments.</b> These instruments can be assets such as stocks, indices, currencies or commo-dities. An important factor infl uencing values of multi-asset options is correlation among log-returns of underlying assets. Thus the options are also called correlation options. In the paper there are presented description and models for pricing selected correlation options: quotient, product, spread and two-color rainbow options. There are also given some exam-ples of their use on the grain market in Poland...|$|R
40|$|The globilisation {{phenomena}} {{is causing}} an increasing interaction between different markets and sectors. This {{has led to}} the evolution of derivative instruments from ”single asset” instruments to complex derivatives that have underlying assets from different markets, sectors and sub-sectors. These are the so-called hybrid products that have multi-assets as <b>underlying</b> <b>instruments.</b> This article focuses on interest rate hybrid products. In this article an analysis of the application of stochastic interest rate models and stochastic volatility models in pricing and hedging interest rate hybrid products will be explored...|$|R
50|$|One of the {{practical}} advantages of an iron condor over a single vertical spread (a put spread or call spread), is that the initial and maintenance margin requirements for the iron condor are often {{the same as the}} margin requirements for a single vertical spread, yet the iron condor offers the profit potential of two net credit premiums instead of only one. This can significantly improve the potential rate of return on capital risked when the trader doesn't expect the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument's</b> spot price to change significantly.|$|R
