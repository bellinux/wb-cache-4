5|$|Finally {{revealed}} to be a ghost story inspired by nineteenth-century French fantasy literature, the film uses the conventions of the genre —that people who die in emotional distress or with an unfinished task may become ghosts— and openly details these conventions. Marie and Adrienne's 'lives' as revenants are reduced to a single purpose, each with only {{the memory of her}} suicide and her last emotions remaining. Julien, like the audience, is eventually confronted with Marie's nightmare of repetition. Elements of the horror genre are <b>used,</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> scare but to explore memory and loss. To stay with Marie, Julien first has to forget about her, and at the end they have the promise of a new beginning. Marie becomes a living person again rather than an object of fantasy. Marie's tears and blood are a miracle overcoming her death, and may reflect a fantasy of turning back the menopause. The credits are accompanied by an upbeat jazz song performed by Blossom Dearie, Our Day Will Come, that represents love as a pledge, the only music used in the film.|$|E
5|$|First and Second World War dazzle camouflage, {{pioneered by}} English artist Norman Wilkinson, was <b>used</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> make ships disappear, {{but to make}} them seem smaller and/or faster, to {{encourage}} misidentification by an enemy {{and to make the}} ships harder to hit. In the Second World War, the Royal Canadian Navy trialled a form of active camouflage, counter-illumination, using diffused lighting to prevent ships from appearing as dark shapes against a brighter sky during the night. It reduced visibility by up to 70%, but was unreliable and never went into production.|$|E
25|$|The {{order in}} which the stages was opened was {{influenced}} by the industry-centric flows of passengers of the Soviet period, and the depot placement issue. Cross-river traffic <b>used</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be as intense as it is today. GAZ was not only the dominating employer of the Avtozavodsky district, but also consumed a lot of workforce from the Northern parts of the city. The only suitable plot for the train depot was found near the automobile plant, too.|$|E

25|$|Discrete choice models {{specify the}} {{probability}} that an individual chooses an option among a set of alternatives. The probabilistic description of discrete choice behavior is <b>used</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> reflect individual behavior that is viewed as intrinsically probabilistic. Rather, it {{is the lack of}} information that leads us to describe choice in a probabilistic fashion. In practice, we cannot know all factors affecting individual choice decisions as their determinants are partially observed or imperfectly measured. Therefore, discrete choice models rely on stochastic assumptions and specifications to account for unobserved factors related to a) choice alternatives, b) taste variation over people (interpersonal heterogeneity) and over time (intra-individual choice dynamics), and c) heterogeneous choice sets. The different formulations have been summarized and classified into groups of models.|$|E
25|$|For {{the most}} part, mind-altering {{substances}} {{were used in}} rituals by medicine men to achieve a higher state of consciousness or trance-like state. These substances were used for mental and spiritual health purposes. Flora such as peyote, the morning glory, certain mushrooms, tobacco, and plants used to make alcoholic substances, were commonly used. The smoking of tobacco mixed with other plants produced a trance-like state. Alcoholic substances were used at rituals and were extremely strong. Hallucinogens were used {{to communicate with the}} spirit world. A number of these substances were <b>used</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> cure sickness, but instead for pain relief. In addition, as depicted in Maya pottery and carvings, ritual enemas were used for a more rapid absorption and effect of the substance. In contrast to modern culture, these remedies were used to restore balance and harmony to the body.|$|E

[...] Thus when IVth Chamber was reopened, increasing the number of chambers to six, a sixth Officer was created, the Coll: Lib: Prae:, in charge of Upper Coll: Lib: (the fiction library available to Collegemen).

2500|$|An {{emergent}} property {{need not}} be more complicated than the underlying non-emergent properties which generate it. [...] For instance, the laws of thermodynamics are remarkably simple, even if the laws which govern the interactions between component particles are complex. [...] The term emergence in physics is thus <b>used</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> signify complexity, but rather to distinguish which laws and concepts apply to macroscopic scales, and which ones apply to microscopic scales.|$|E
2500|$|In Inuktitut, {{something}} similar is <b>used</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> indicate sequences, but to represent additional consonants, rather as the digraphs ch, sh, th {{were used to}} extend the Latin letters c, s, t to represent additional consonants in English. In Inuktitut, a raised na-ga is placed before the g- series, ᖏ ᖑ ᖓ, to form an ng- (...) series, and a raised ra (uvular [...] ) is placed before syllables of the k- series, ᕿ ᖁ ᖃ, to form a uvular q- series.|$|E

However, I must point out that the assistance voted by this House in the Shipbuilding Industry Act was meant to be <b>used</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> save uneconomic yards but to assist reorganisation with a view to promoting competitiveness in the industry. If the Burntisland yard fits that pattern, I shall be pleased, but I do not think that an inquiry would help us as of now." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} Christian teachings {{on property}} support the Franciscan/stewardship {{interpretation of the}} Bible. Against this view, Martin Luther condemned church ownership of lands because [...] "they {{did not want to}} use that property in an economically productive fashion. At best they used it to produce prayers. Luther, and other Reformation leaders insisted that it should be <b>used,</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> relieve men from the necessity of working, but as a tool for making more goods. The attitude of the Reformation was practically, [...] "not prayers, but production." [...] And production, not for consumption, but for more production." [...] This justification was offered to support secular takings of church endowments and properties.|$|E
2500|$|Brown {{was active}} in campaigning in New York for the passage of women's suffrage. Victory there on [...] November 6, 1917 was an {{important}} step towards {{the passage of the}} Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Following the passage of women suffrage in New York State in 1917, and pending passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, Brown wrote Your Vote and How to Use It. [...] It was published in February 1918 by Harper & Brothers, and was endorsed by the New York State Women Suffrage Party. In it she encouraged New York women to be good citizens and exercise their new ability to vote. [...] Dealing with civics [...] "from the standpoint of the woman voter", women were encouraged to [...] "regard their vote as a trust to be <b>used</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> advance partisan politics, but to further human welfare." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mark Mardell, the BBC News North America editor, {{criticized the}} [...] "whole process, {{which has been}} <b>used</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> examine a candidate's fitness for high office, but to {{underline}} the rather obvious fact that the Obama administration does not share the world view of Republican senators, and they don't like their former colleague joining it." [...] Mardell noted the senators repeatedly [...] "insisted he gave a simple 'yes' or 'no' to complex questions. These are old men who hold themselves in high regard, but seem to see serious examination of difficult problems as a personal affront. They desperately want to play 'gotcha', but haven't the self-restraint to design effective questions." [...] Mardell called Senator Hagel [...] "equally unimpressive, almost unprepared, for a level of hostility that had been signalled long in advance. Neither smart, nor humble, his tactic {{seemed to be a}} kind of bumbling blandness." [...] According to Mardell, only Senator Cruz was effective and well-prepared, as [...] "he ripped into the nominee with all the skill honed as a Texas solicitor general." ...|$|E
