When he takes it to his office and places it together with a similar artifact, the two suddenly fuse and fly across the room, becoming embedded in a Bible. Merkmallen then travels to the <b>U.S.</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> with Steven Sandoz, an American University biologist who has a third artifact. However, he is murdered by a man posing as Sandoz; when the real Sandoz finds the body, he flees.|$|E

2500|$|The {{little known}} about {{his years in}} Rome {{is found in the}} {{autobiography}} of his friend Gino Severini (1883-1966), who recalled their meeting in 1901 and mutual interest in Nietzsche, rebellion, life experiences and socialism. Boccioni's writings at this time already express the combination of outrage and irony that would become a lifelong characteristic. His critical and rebellious nature, and overall intellectual ability, would contribute substantially {{to the development of the}} Futurism movement. After building a foundation of skills, having studied the classics through Impressionism, both he and Severini became students of Giacomo Balla (1871-1958), a painter focusing on the modern Divisionist technique, painting with divided rather than mixed color and breaking the painted surface into a field of stippled dots and stripes. Severini wrote [...] "It was a great stroke of luck for <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> such a man, whose direction was decisive of all our careers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Studds was {{a central}} figure in the 1983 Congressional page sex scandal, when he and Representative Dan Crane were each {{separately}} censured by the House of Representatives for an inappropriate relationship with a congressional page — in Studds' case, a 1983 sexual relationship with a 17-year-old male. During {{the course of the}} House Ethics Committee's investigation, Studds publicly acknowledged his homosexuality, a disclosure that, according to a Washington Post article, [...] "apparently was not news to many of his constituents." [...] Studds stated in an address to the House, [...] "It is not a simple task for any of <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> adequately the obligations of either public or private life, let alone both, but these challenges are made substantially more complex when one is, as I am, both an elected public official and gay." [...] He acknowledged that it had been inappropriate to engage in a relationship with a subordinate, and said his actions represented [...] "a very serious error in judgment." ...|$|E

2500|$|At Twentieth and Providence Avenues, the Nixon {{motorcade}} {{suddenly stopped}} and Nixon strode {{across the street}} to greet John McClure, who was recovering in a wheelchair from a hip fracture. [...] "They (the Secret Service) didn't want me to stop, but I just couldn't pass you up." [...] They both chatted for a few moments, then Nixon and his motorcade continued up Route 320, stopping in Swarthmore, the Springfield Shopping Center, Lawrence Park, Newtown Square, West Chester, before stopping in Paoli. Seven days later, Senator Kennedy appeared in Chester at Sixth and Penn Streets, drawing the largest ever crowd in the city, some 15,000 to 20,000. He continued to hammer away at the themes of America's lagging prestige abroad and lagging economy at home. [...] "I want the <b>U.S.</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> its responsibilities at home and abroad and the U.S. to move forward", he told the crowds. [...] "This is more of a contest between the comfortable and the concerned - those who are satisfied with things as they are and those who want to move forward."

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1914, Welsh {{contacted}} Ritchie {{and asked him if}} he would face him in England, providing he got a satisfactory guarantee of money. Ritchie agreed that he would fight for the right money. Welsh cabled the Olympia Theatre, London and began booking advertising space. When Ritchie finally stated that he wanted $50,000, win lose or draw, Welsh said the price [...] "would make a horse laugh", and was double what he was expecting. Despite this huge fee, England was desperate for a world champion and $40,000 was raised on the stipulation that Ritchie fought no other bouts in the meantime. Ritchie accepted the $40,000 but stated a fight was already planned and he would fight who he liked. The London syndicate relented to his demands. Before Ritchie's arranged fight with Charley White, Welsh took in two more encounters, beating Leach Cross on points and then Joe Mandot on press decision. All attention then switched to the White-Ritchie fight in Milwaukee. In almost the first punch that White connected with, Ritchie was in trouble. Staggered, Ritchie was laid open to a battering, but stayed on his feet {{until the end of the}} fight. White was declared winner, but as he had failed to stop Ritchie before the end of the match, he kept his World title. Pollok and Welsh then took a major gamble. They sent a telegram to Ritchie with the message, 'Promoters have called off match with you. Want <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> White.', a bluff to force the Champion's hand. The following day Ritchie accepted a fee for $25,000 and $1,500 expenses to meet Welsh in London. The White fight had cost him almost $15,000.|$|E
