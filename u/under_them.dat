5|$|Because of {{insufficient}} clearance {{between the}} locomotives and the 25kV overhead electric wires south of Crewe, {{the whole class}} was banned from operating <b>under</b> <b>them</b> with effect from 1 September 1964. To highlight this prohibition a yellow diagonal stripe was painted on the cab sides. This inability of the locomotives to operate {{on the line for}} which they were designed was crucial in the decision to withdraw the entire class.|$|E

There is also a chapter of the honorary association Beta Alpha Psi.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Cold War, the US Army {{considered}} new {{options for}} the integration and organization of active duty, Army Reserve and Army National Guard units in training and deployment. Two division headquarters activated in the active duty component for training National Guard units. The 7th Infantry Division and the 24th Infantry Division headquarters were selected. The subordinate brigades of the divisions did not activate so they could not be deployed as divisions, however their active duty status would allow the headquarters to focus on the national guard units <b>under</b> <b>them</b> full-time.|$|E

5|$|Many millennia {{after the}} Knights of Cybertron had left their home planet, its {{population}} had become separated into tribes, each {{led by a}} Prime. At some point, these tribes came into conflict with each other, resulting in a devastating war raging across the entire planet. In the end, the warrior most instrumental in ending the conflict was Galvatron, of the tribe of Megatronus. He defeated many other tribes, until finally joining forces with another warrior, now without a master, called Nova Major. Together they ended the war with an armistice and united the survivors <b>under</b> <b>them,</b> with Nova taking the role of leader, and the title of Prime.|$|E
5|$|The kingdom {{was divided}} into provinces such as Banavasi-12000, Nolambavadi-32000, Gangavadi-96000, each name {{including}} the number of villages under its jurisdiction. The large provinces were divided into smaller provinces containing a lesser number of villages, as in Belavola-300. The big provinces were called Mandala and <b>under</b> <b>them</b> were Nadu further divided into Kampanas (groups of villages) and finally a Bada (village). A Mandala was under {{a member of the}} royal family, a trusted feudatory or a senior official. Tailapa II himself was in charge of Tardavadi province during the Rashtrakuta rule. Chiefs of Mandalas were transferable based on political developments. For example, an official named Bammanayya administered Banavasi-12000 under King Someshvara III but was later transferred to Halasige-12000. Women from the royal family also administered Nadus and Kampanas. Army commanders were titled Mahamandaleshwaras and those who headed a Nadu were entitled Nadugouvnda.|$|E
5|$|Under the Romans {{and later}} the Byzantines, Gaza {{experienced}} relative peace and its port flourished. In 635 AD, it became the first city in Palestine to be conquered by the Rashidun army and quickly developed into a center of Islamic law. However, {{by the time the}} Crusaders invaded the city in the late 11th century, it was in ruins. In later centuries, Gaza experienced several hardships—from Mongol raids to floods and locusts, reducing it to a village by the 16th century, when it was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. During the first half of Ottoman rule, the Ridwan dynasty controlled Gaza and <b>under</b> <b>them</b> the city went through an age of great commerce and peace. The municipality of Gaza was established in 1893.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about Atangana's childhood. Like other Beti boys, he would have learned to fish, hunt, and trap, and would have {{memorised}} his family's genealogy and folk wisdom. Explorers from the German Empire appeared near his village in 1887 {{in search of a}} direct route to the ivory trade in the savannas to the north. They had claimed Beti lands as part of their Kamerun colony in 1884, and by February 1889 they had established a permanent base in the area, which they named Jaunde after the local people. The Ewondo opposed the foreigners at first, although Atangana was probably not yet old enough to participate in the fighting. After the defeat of Omgba Bissogo in 1895 and others like it, Ewondo resistance waned. The Germans randomly appointed chiefs and mayors to serve <b>under</b> <b>them,</b> and took local youths to perform menial tasks; Atangana was among them, sent by his uncle to be a houseboy.|$|E
5|$|The Restaurant was {{the first}} time White had a kitchen staff {{organised}} into traditional brigades such as he had worked in while at Albert Roux's Le Gavroche. At Harveys, White had eight chefs under him on average, which was expanded to a team of about 20 at The Restaurant. Five of the chefs moved from Harveys to The Restaurant with him, while another former Harveys chef joined them among several others who joined from other Michelin starred restaurants from the UK and France. This enabled White to adopt a structure with himself, a head chef, a team of four or five sous chefs and teams on fish, meat/sauce, larder and pastry. Each of those sections was then broken down into a chef de partie heading the team, and then commis chefs <b>under</b> <b>them.</b> By 1994, Éric Chavot had joined the brigade as head chef under White. He left the following year with White's assistance to open the restaurant Interlude de Chavot.|$|E
