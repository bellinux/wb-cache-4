Six birds from each dietary treatment were killed at each FW time point and ileal mucosa and digesta were collected. Microbial com-munities were determined by isolating bacterial DNA, amplifying the V 3 region of 16 S ribosomal DNA, and performing denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that elimination of facultative and strict anaerobic microorganisms <b>from</b> the <b>gastro-intestinal</b> <b>tract</b> by antimicrobial {{drugs in the}} period of time around allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) prevents acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), was examined in a cohort of 112 children grafted between 1989 and 2002 for hematological malignancies. All patients received T-cell replete marrow from human leukocyte antigens (HLA) matched sibling donors under identical transplantation conditions. To eliminate microorganisms <b>from</b> the <b>gastro-intestinal</b> <b>tract,</b> total <b>gastro-intestinal</b> decontamination (GID) was applied by high doses of non-absorbable antimicrobial drugs while the graft recipient was maintained in strict protective isolation. About half of the children (51 %) proved to be successfully decontaminated, and about half (49 %) unsuccessfully. One recipient got acute GVHD in the first group and 8 in the second group (p = 0. 013). The degree of success of total GID was decisive for the occurrence of acute GVHD, irrespective of the presence of other risk factors such as higher age of recipient and/or donor, female donor for male recipient and carriership or reactivation of herpesviruses. Our results demonstrate that successful total GID of the graft recipient prevents moderate to severe acute GVHD. We suppose that substantial translocation of gastro-intestinal microorganisms or parts of these, functioning as microbial-associated molecular patterns (MAMP’s), triggering macrophages/dendritic cells via pattern recognizing receptors (PRR’s) is prohibited.

One hundred and three isolates of Bacillus sp. which showed no hemolytic activity were obtained from 2 sampling sites of the Nile Tilapia net-cage culture farms. Among these 103 isolates, however, there was only 1 isolate, named as Bacillus UBRU 4 which showed the inhibitory effect on Aeromonas hydrophila growth. The results of physiological and biochemical test and molecular identification (99. 90 % identity) showed that Bacillus UBRU 4 was similar to Bacillus brevis. This was possibly the first report of isolation of Bacillus brevis in aquaculture. The optimum pH and temperature for Bacillus UBRU 4 growth on Tryptic soy broth were 6. 5 and 37 C, respectively.

40|$|Abstract: Fruits and {{vegetables}} are rich in flavonoids, and ample epidemiological data show that diets rich in fruits {{and vegetables}} confer protection against cardiovascular, neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases, and cancer. However, flavonoid bioavailability is reportedly very low in mammals and the molecular mechanisms of their action are still poorly known.

Cellular influx and efflux transporters are reviewed for their involvement in the absorption of flavonoids <b>from</b> the <b>gastro-intestinal</b> <b>tract</b> and their subsequent tissue distribution. A focus on the mammalian bilirubin transporter bilitranslocase (TCDB 2.

The general function of bilitranslocase as a flavonoid membrane transporter is further demonstrated by the occurrence of a plant homologue in organs (petals, berries) where flavonoid biosynthesis is most active. Bilitranslocase appears associated with sub-cellular membrane compartments and operates as a flavonoid membrane transporter...|$|R

Cumulative food intake was significantly increased 1 hr and 2 hr after the intraperitoneally-applied ghrelin (20 μg/kg). Desensitization of C-fiber of the afferent vagus nerves by intraperitoneally-applied capsaicin completely abolished the increases in the ghrelin-induced food intake. Surgical vagotomy of the hepatic or gastric branches markedly suppressed the ghrelin-evoked feeding. Furthermore, pretreatment with ramosetoron also significantly suppressed the ghrelin-evoked feeding. Stimulatory effects of ghrelin on the appetite were transient and the overall food intake was comparable after 24 hr among all groups. These data suggest that 1) exogenous ghrelin rapidly promotes feeding, but such feeding lasts no more than 2 hr; 2) afferent C-fiber of the hepatic or gastric vagus nerves appear to convey ghrelininduced hungry sensation to the brain; 3) type- 3 serotonin receptors at the nerve endings of the C-fiber of the gastric or hepatic afferent vagus nerves may involve in transmitting the ghrelin-evoked hungry sensation...|$|R

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{relevance of}} the concept of bioavailability rests on two main principles. First, that measurement of the active component at the site of action is generally not possible and, secondly, that a relationship exists between on the one hand efficacy and/or safely {{and on the other hand}} concentration of the active compound or its active metabolite(s) in the systemic circulation. Applying these principles to the current knowledge on methotrexate (MTX), it is clear that bioavailability of MTX is an important parameter for optimal dosing. In this manuscript the current knowledge on MTX bioavailability is reviewed. This review reveals that bioavailability of MTX in higher oral doses is decreased, most probably by limitation of absorption <b>from</b> the <b>gastro-intestinal</b> <b>tract.</b> It is suggested that higher doses can be given either by splitting the oral dose or by parenteral administration. Both will result in improved bioavailability as compared with one higher oral dose. However, larger, prospective studies directly comparing the efficacy and safety of the splitted oral dose strategy and the switch to parenteral MTX are needed...|$|R
40|$|Pempidine (1 : 2 : 2 : 6 : 6 -pentamethylpiperidine) is a long-acting ganglion-blocking {{compound}} {{which is}} effective by mouth. By intravenous injection {{it has a}} similar potency to hexamethonium on the preganglionically stimulated nictitating membrane of the cat. The compound blocks the effects of intravenous nicotine and of peripheral vagal stimulation on the blood pressure; it also causes dilatation of the pupil after removal of the sympathetic innervation. On the guinea-pig ileum, the predominant effect of the compound is to inhibit nicotine contractions. Pempidine is well absorbed <b>from</b> the <b>gastro-intestinal</b> <b>tract</b> as judged by (a) the low ratio (6. 9) of oral to intravenous toxicities, (b) the rapid development of mydriasis in mice after oral administration of small doses, and (c) the rapid onset of hypotension when the compound is injected directly into the duodenum of anaesthetized cats. Other actions include neuromuscular paralysis of curare-like type when large doses of the compound are injected intravenously and central effects such as tremors which occur with near toxic doses. In cats with a low blood pressure, large intravenous doses have a slight pressor action...|$|R
40|$|Newer {{antibiotic}} {{agents have}} greatly extended {{the range of}} specific therapy {{in the group of}} infec-tious diseases with increasing rapidity. Much of this effort is directed against gram-negative bacilli in which group the Brucellae command a promi-nent position. Up to the present time the use of therapeutic agents in brucellosis has resulted in a certain measure of success, but with limitations, particularly {{from the point of view}} of failure to prevent recurrences. One of these new antibiotics is chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin) a streptomyces, first isolated by Burkholder, 7 crystallized by Ehrlich and his asso-ciates (1) and demonstrated to possess potent anti-microbial effect against many gram-negative or-ganisms including all members of the Brucella group (2). The pharmacological and toxicologi-cal characteristics of this new agent are now a matter of record (2) and the chemical structure of the antibiotic agent is known. (3). In experi-mental and clinical infections the synthetic form of Chloromycetin has been found comparable to the naturally produced product in degree of ef-fectiveness (4). Chloromycetin is well absorbed <b>from</b> the <b>gastro-intestinal</b> <b>tract.</b> Serum levels of the drug after oral administration have been found comparable to those obtained by parenteral administration...|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of symbiotic relationships between bacteria in different ecosystems and their host niches {{have long been}} known to science. The human body also hosts vast numbers of bacteria in several habitats. Emerging evidence <b>from</b> the <b>gastro-intestinal</b> <b>tract,</b> genito-urinary tract and respiratory indicates that there are several health benefits to hosting a complex and diverse microbial community i. Bacteria colonize the oral cavity {{within a few minutes}} after birth and form stable communities. Our knowledge of the oral microbiome has expanded exponentially with development of novel exploratory methods that allow us to examine diversity, structure, function and topography without the need to cultivate the individual components of the biofilm. The purpose of this perspective, therefore, is to examine the strength of current evidence supporting a role for the oral microbiome in maintaining oral health. While several lines of evidence are emerging to suggest that indigenous oral microbiota may have a role in immune education and preventing pathogen expansion, much more work is needed to definitively establish whether oral bacteria do indeed contribute to sustaining oral health, and if so, the mechanisms underlying this role...|$|R
