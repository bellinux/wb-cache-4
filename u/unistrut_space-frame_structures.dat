40|$|<b>Space-frame</b> <b>structures</b> {{supporting}} marine {{renewable energy}} machines such as offshore wind turbines {{are exposed to}} complex hydrodynamic forces resulting from the coexistence of waves and currents. Previous investigations on the interaction of such a structure acting as an obstacle array with regular waves and in-line uniform current reported a reduced fluid loading due to current blockage. This paper documents laboratory-scale experimental evidence for reduced fluid loading on a truss structure exposed to regular waves with in-line sheared current in shallow water. Strongly sheared current of different speeds is generated and profiled using purposely-built wire resistance arrays in a wave-current flume, {{and a range of}} regular waves are created using a piston-type wavemaker. The global hydrodynamic force time history on a truss structure is measured for a range of sheared current speeds and regular wave heights. For all test cases, two loading configurations are considered, with the truss positioned end-on and diagonal to the incident flow direction. Comparisons are made with the analytical current blockage model for steady uniform current by Taylor (1991) and Taylor et al. (2013), and with the numerical simulations conducted in OpenFOAM using a porous tower model following the approach by Santo et al. (2015 a). Under the same input condition, the diagonal loading configuration is observed to attract higher forces and therefore the orientation of the structure plays an important role when assessing the survivability of such structures. Overall, good agreement in terms of the peak forces and the shapes of force time histories is achieved for all cases with an inline current, all with a single and consistent value for each of the local Morison drag and inertia coefficients (here Cd ∼ 2. 1 and Cm ∼ 2), with the coefficients defined in terms of the overall structure. In contrast, predictions using the present API recommendation with the same Cd and Cm result in force overpredictions for all cases of regular waves with in-line current. For steady sheared current flow through a porous tower, apart from the dominant lateral flow divergence, numerical flow visualisation reveals the existence of vertical flow interaction in the porous tower. This is attributed to the non-uniform loading with water depth and was not observed previously for uniform current flow. This study provides the first experimental validation and justification for the use of a simple porous block in representing a complex geometry of real <b>space-frame</b> <b>structures</b> when exposed to combined large regular waves and in-line current...|$|R

A preliminary mass breakdown of the SKYLON D 1 vehicle was determined using parametric methods, based on vehicle performance parameters and geometric data provided by REL. The margin philosophy provided by REL {{was found to be}} insufficient, and it should be re-iterated. A mass breakdown of the SKYLON Upper Stage (SUS) was also generated using empirical methods based on performance and geometric data provided by REL. Subsystem masses were scaled from the Ariane 6 PPH studies. The ascent trajectory of the SKYLON vehicle was modelled in three parts; the air-breathing ascent, using a comparable turbo/ram engine; the rocket ascent using the SABRE engine; and the SUS flight. It was determined that the SKYLON vehicle with the DLR-SART mass estimates could not achieve orbit, however an optimized trajectory was found for the vehicle using REL mass assumptions. Finally, the performance of the SABRE engine was determined. The conventional rocket-mode performance of the SABRE was found to be highly consistent with REL-provided data, however due to convergence issues related to the control of the innovative pre-cooler used in the air-breathing mode, the full air-breathing cycle could not be modelled.

At this time, however, there is disagreement as to what the strength requirements for the 6 -pack pallet are. Depending on which classification applies to the structure, a factor of safety (yield stress over design stress) of 3. 0 or more may need to be satisfied. This report documents strength analyses of loaded 6 -packs performed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). The entire 6 -pack assembly was discretized into a mesh with a total of 38682 first-order finite elements. The stresses were found for four characteristic load cases using the implicit code NIKE 3 D. This was a static strength analysis only. Dynamic loading was not considered. Stability, also, was not addressed. There are two 6 -pack pallet designs under consideration: one that uses 1 / 2 inch diameter bolts and one with 3 / 8 inch bolts. In both cases, the maximum torque applied to the bolts is 55 in-lbf.

Several concepts are proposed for converting these resources into simple products with many uses. Concrete is already being considered as a possible moonbase material. Manufacturing equipment should be as small and simple as possible, which leads to the idea of molding it into miniature modules that can be produced and assembled in large numbers to create any conceivable shape. Automated equipment could build up complex structures by laying down layer after layer in a process resembling stereolithography. These tiny concrete blocks handle compression loads and provide a barrier to harmful radiation. They are joined by a web of tension members that could be made of wire or fiber-reinforced plastic. The finished structure becomes air-tight {{with the addition of a}} flexible liner. Wire can be made from the iron modules found in lunar soil. In addition to its structural role, a relatively simple apparatus can bend and weld it into countless products like chairs and shelving that would otherwise need to be supplied from Earth. Wire woven into a loose blanket could be an effective micrometeoroid shield, tiny wire compression beams could be assembled into larger beams which in turn form larger beams to create very large <b>space-frame</b> <b>structures.</b> A technology developed with lunar materials could be applied to the moons of Mars or the asteroids. To illustrate its usefulness several designs for free-flying habitats are presented. They begin with a minimal self-contained living unit called the Cubicle. It may be multiplied into clusters called Condos. These are shown in a rotating tether configuration that provides a substitute for gravity. The miniature block proposal is compared with an alternate design based on larger triangular components and a tetrahedral geometry. The overall concept may be expanded to envision city-sized self-sufficient environments where humans could confortably live their entire lives. One such proposal is the Hive. It is configured around a unique sunlight collection system that could provide all its energy needs and that could be scaled up to compensate for the reduced solar intensity at greater distances from the sun. Its outer perimeter consists of a cylindrical section mated to two conical end walls that taper inwards toward a small aperture at the center of rotation. Light collected by two huge mirrors of unusual design enters the aperture and is redirected to the inside of the cylinder. The conical end walls are shielded from direct sunlight and are designed to radiate heat into space. They are lined with air ducts that passively recirculate the atmosphere while extracting moisture by condensation.

The Mockingbird Design Team at the University of Texas at Austin applied small satellite design principles to achieve this objective. The Mockingbird design, named BATSAT, incorporates simple, low-cost systems designed for university production and testing. The BATSAT satellite is a 0. 64 m diameter, spherical panel led satellite, mounted with solar cells and omni-directional antennae. The antennae configuration negates the need for active attitude control or spin stabilization.
