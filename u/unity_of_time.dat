500|$|The typescript of {{the essay}} is headed by an epigraph, {{attributed}} to The Upbringing of Daughters by Catherine Durning Whethem. It reads: [...] "The chief justification of reading books of any sort is the enlargement of experience that should accrue therefrom". The text which follows is, in Motion's words, [...] "a homily on how and how not to write for children". It argues for the need for well-drawn heroines, and for unrepentant villainesses: [...] "To be tenacious in evil {{is the duty of}} every villain... Let her hate the heroine wholeheartedly, and refuse, yes, even on the last page, to take her hand in forgiveness". The story should not be about schoolgirls, but about a school with girls in it. The school must be English; foreign settings or trips abroad are disparaged. Larkin, in Coleman's voice, pleads for [...] "the Classic Unities": Unity of Place, which is the school and its inhabitants; <b>Unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>Time,</b> normally the term in which the action occurs; and Unity of Action, whereby every recorded incident contributes in some way to the telling of the story. The essay is laden with quotations from many writers of the genre, among them Joy Francis, Dorita Fairlie Bruce, Elsie J. Oxenham, Elinor Brent-Dyer and Nancy Breary.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to Hamlet's worth as a tragic hero, Restoration critics {{focused on the}} qualities of Shakespeare's language and, above all, {{on the question of}} tragic decorum. Critics disparaged the indecorous range of Shakespeare's language, with Polonius's fondness for puns and Hamlet's use of [...] "mean" [...] (i.e., low) expressions such as [...] "there's the rub" [...] receiving particular attention. Even more important was the question of decorum, which in the case of Hamlet focused on the play's violation of tragic <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and place, and on the characters. Jeremy Collier attacked the play on both counts in his Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage, published in 1698. Comparing Ophelia to Electra, he condemns Shakespeare for allowing his heroine to become [...] "immodest" [...] in her insanity, particularly in the [...] "Flower Scene".|$|E

2500|$|... "In poetry", writes Robbins, [...] "this post-symbolist {{attempt to}} achieve new forms {{had to break}} decisively with the old unities of time, place and action. Unity of scene did not {{correspond}} {{with the reality of}} modem life; <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> did not correspond with the culturally known and anticipated effects of change. That is why Mercereau (as Metzinger noted) shifted his scenes so violently, why Barzun tried {{to solve the problem of}} simultaneously developing lines of action by choral chanting. Similarly Gleizes and his painter friends sought to create a vision free from introverted or obscure imagery which could treat collective and simultaneous factors. This necessitated a new kind of allegory opposed to the old meaning which presented one thing as the symbolic equivalent of another. A tentative precedent perhaps existed in Courbet's Real Allegory which, however, might have been considered an allegorical failure by Gleizes and Metzinger because Courbet [...] "did not suspect that the visible world only became the real world by the operation of thought".|$|E

60|$|N.B.--There is a {{point of}} some {{technical}} interest to be noted in this play. The customary division into acts and scenes has been disused, and a return made to <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and place, as observed in the ancient Greek drama. In the foregoing tragedy, The Doctor's Dilemma, there are five acts; the place is altered five times; and the time is spread over an undetermined period of more than a year. No doubt the strain on the attention of the audience and on the ingenuity of the playwright is much less; but I find in practice that the Greek form is inevitable when drama reaches a certain point in poetic and intellectual evolution. Its adoption was not, on my part, a deliberate display of virtuosity in form, but simply the spontaneous falling of a play of ideas into the form most suitable to it, {{which turned out to be}} the classical form. Getting Married, in several acts and scenes, with the time spread over a long period, would be impossible.|$|E
500|$|In {{line with}} Schlegel, more than with any {{previous}} English-language critic (except Coleridge, who also followed Schlegel), Hazlitt found [...] "unity" [...] in Shakespeare's plays {{not in their}} observing the traditional classical <b>unities</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> place, and action, but in their <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> theme. His most complete elaboration of this idea is in his chapter on Antony and Cleopatra: ...|$|R
25|$|Thus, critics {{considered}} Hamlet in a milieu which abundantly {{demonstrated the}} play's dramatic viability. John Evelyn saw the play in 1661, {{and in his}} Diary he deplored the play's violation <b>of</b> the <b>unities</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and place. Yet {{by the end of}} the period, John Downes noted that Hamlet was staged more frequently and profitably than any other play in Betterton's repertory.|$|R
5000|$|It mostly {{follows the}} <b>unities</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> (happens {{in a short}} amount <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> usually 24 hours), place (happens in one place) and plot (one or few plot lines). It also has a five-act structure, {{and most of the}} {{characters}} follow decorum. However, with verisimilitude (or, the appearance of truth), the play is lacking. The idea that the entire plot line could happen within 24 to 48 hours is astonishing.|$|R
60|$|Shakespeare {{found the}} infant stage {{demanding}} an intermixture of ludicrous character as imperiously {{as that of}} Greece did the chorus, and high language accordant. And there are many advantages in this;—a greater assimilation to nature, a greater scope of power, more truths, and more feelings;—the effects of contrast, as in Lear and the Fool; and especially this, that the true language of passion becomes sufficiently elevated by your having previously heard, in the same piece, the lighter conversation of men under no strong emotion. The very nakedness of the stage, too, was advantageous,—for the drama thence became something between recitation and a representation; and the absence or paucity of scenes allowed a freedom from the laws of unity of place and <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> the observance of which must either confine the drama to as few subjects as may be counted on the fingers, or involve gross improbabilities, far more striking than the violation would have caused. Thence, also, was precluded the danger of a false ideal,—of aiming at more than what is possible on the whole. What play of the ancients, with reference to their ideal, does not hold out more glaring absurdities than any in Shakespeare? On the Greek plan a man could more easily be a poet than a dramatist; upon our plan more easily a dramatist than a poet.|$|E
60|$|In the Greek drama {{there were}} no formal {{divisions}} into scenes and acts; {{there were no}} means, therefore, of allowing for the necessary lapse of time between {{one part of the}} dialogue and another, and <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> in a strict sense was, of course, impossible. To overcome that difficulty of accounting for time, which is effected on the modern stage by dropping a curtain, the judgment and great genius of the ancients supplied music and measured motion, and with the lyric ode filled up the vacuity. In the story of the Agamemnon of Æschylus, the capture of Troy is supposed to be announced by a fire lighted on the Asiatic shore, and the transmission of the signal by successive beacons to Mycenæ. The signal is first seen at the 21st line, and the herald from Troy itself enters at the 486th, and Agamemnon himself at the 783rd line. But the practical absurdity of this was not felt by the audience, who, in imagination stretched minutes into hours, while they listened to the lofty narrative odes of the chorus which almost entirely filled up the interspace. Another fact deserves attention here, namely, that regularly on the Greek stage a drama, or acted story, consisted in reality of three dramas, called together a trilogy, and performed consecutively in the course of one day. Now you may conceive a tragedy of Shakespeare’s as a trilogy connected in one single representation. Divide Lear into three parts, and each would be a play with the ancients; or take the three Æschylean dramas of Agamemnon, and divide them into, or call them, as many acts, and they together would be one play. The first act would comprise the usurpation of Ægisthus, and the murder of Agamemnon; the second, the revenge of Orestes, and the murder of his mother; and the third, the penance and absolution of Orestes;—occupying a period of twenty-two years.|$|E
6000|$|Dr. Johnson has {{remarked that}} {{little or nothing}} is wanting to render the Othello a regular tragedy, but to have opened the play {{with the arrival of}} Othello in Cyprus, and to have thrown the {{preceding}} act into the form of narration.

For in all acts of judgment, it can never be too often recollected, and scarcely too often repeated, that rules are means to ends, and, consequently, that the end must be determined and understood before it can be known what the rules are or ought to be. Now, from a certain species of drama, proposing to itself the accomplishment of certain ends,—these partly arising from the idea of the species itself, but in part, likewise, forced upon the dramatist by accidental circumstances beyond his power to remove or control,—three rules have been abstracted;—in other words, the means most conducive to the attainment of the proposed ends have been generalised, and prescribed under the names of the three unities,—the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> the unity of place, and the unity of action—which last would, perhaps, have been as appropriately, as well as more intelligibly, entitled the unity of interest. With this last the present question has no immediate concern: in fact, its conjunction with the former two is a mere delusion of words. It is not properly a rule, but in itself the great end not only of the drama, but of the epic poem, the lyric ode, of all poetry, down to the candle-flame cone of an epigram,—nay, of poesy in general, as the proper generic term inclusive of all the fine arts as its species. But of the unities of time and place, which alone are entitled to the name of rules, the history of their origin will be their best criterion. You might take the Greek chorus to a place, but you could not bring a place to them without as palpable an equivoque as bringing Birnam wood to Macbeth at Dunsinane. It was the same, though in a less degree, with regard to the unity of time:—the positive fact, not for a moment removed from the senses, the presence, I mean, of the same identical chorus, was a continued measure of time;—and although the imagination may supersede perception, yet it must be granted to be an imperfection—however easily tolerated—to place the two in broad contradiction to each other. In truth, it is a mere accident of terms; for the Trilogy of the Greek theatre was a drama in three acts, and notwithstanding this, what strange contrivances as to place there are in the Aristophanic Frogs.

The printers and publishers tread on my heels, and I feel their hot breath behind me--whereby I keep at it {{in order not to}} be overtaken. Fortunately I have kept at it so that I am almost out of the wood, and the next very few weeks or so will completely lay the spectre. The case has been complicated badly, moreover, the last month--and even before--by my having, of all things in the world, let myself be drawn into a theatrical adventure--which fortunately appears to have turned out as well as I could have possibly expected or desired. Forbes Robertson and his wife produced on the 26th last in Edinburgh--being on [...] "tour," [...] and the provincial production to begin with, as more experimental, having good reason in its favour--a three-act comedy of mine ("The High Bid")--which is just only the little one-act play presented as a [...] "tale" [...] {{at the end of the}} volume of the [...] "Two Magics"; the one-act play proving really a perfect three-act one, dividing itself (by two short entractes, without fiddles) perfectly at the right little places as climaxes--with the artful beauty of <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and place preserved, etc.... It had a great and charming success before a big house at Edinburgh--a real and unmistakable victory--but what was most brought home thereby is that it should have been discharged straight in the face of London. That will be its real and best function. This I am hoping for during May and June. It has still to be done at Newcastle, Liverpool, etc. (was done this past week three times at Glasgow. Of course on tour three times in a week is the most they can give a play in a minor city.) But my great point is that preparations, rehearsals, lavishments of anxious time over it (after completely re-writing it and improving it to begin with) have represented a sacrifice of days and weeks to them that have direfully devoured my scant margin--thus making my intense nervousness (about them) doubly nervous. I left home on the 17th last and rehearsed hard (every blessed day) at Manchester, and at Edinburgh till the production--having already, three weeks before that in London, given up a whole week to the same. I came back to town a week ago to-night (saw a second night in Edinburgh, which confirmed the impression of the first,) and return to L.H. to-morrow, after a very decent huitaine de jours here during which I have had quiet mornings, and even evenings, of work. I go to Paris about the 20th to stay 10 days, at the most, with Mrs Wharton, and shall be back by May 1st. I yearn to know positively that your Dad and Mother arrive definitely on the Oxford job then. I have had to be horribly inhuman to them in respect to the fond or repeated expression of that yearning--but they will more than understand why, [...] "druv" [...] as I've been, and also understand how the prospect of having them with me, and being with them, for a while, has been all these last months as the immediate jewel of my spur. Read them this letter and let it convey to them, all tenderly, that I live in the hope of their operative advent, and shall bleed half to death if there be any hitch.|$|E
