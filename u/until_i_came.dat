2500|$|From 1963, Pullman {{attended}} Exeter College, Oxford, {{receiving a}} Third class BA in 1968. In {{an interview with}} the Oxford Student [...] he stated that he [...] "did not really enjoy the English course" [...] and that [...] "I thought I was doing quite well <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> out with my third class degree and then I realised that I wasn’t — it was the year they stopped giving fourth class degrees otherwise I’d have got one of those". He discovered William Blake's illustrations around 1970, which would also later influence him greatly.|$|E
2500|$|Bunyan's army service {{provided}} him with a knowledge of military language which he then used in his book The Holy War, and also exposed him to {{the ideas of the}} various religious sects and radical groups he came across in Newport Pagnell. The garrison town also gave him opportunities to indulge in the sort of behaviour he would later confess to in Grace Abounding: [...] "So that <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to the state of Marriage, I was the very ringleader of all the Youth that kept me company, in all manner of vice and ungodliness". Bunyan spent nearly three years in the army, leaving in 1647 to return to Elstow and his trade as a tinker. His father had remarried and had more children and Bunyan moved from Bunyan's End to a cottage in Elstow High Street.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Washington fumed at {{the seeming}} procrastination. When Sherman {{proposed}} his March to the Sea, Ulysses S. Grant and Henry Halleck had objected {{to it on}} the grounds that Hood would use the opportunity to invade Tennessee. In response, Sherman airily indicated that this was exactly what he wanted and that if Hood [...] "continues to march North, all the way to Ohio, I will supply him with rations." [...] However, when the ever-confident Sherman disappeared into the heart of Georgia, Grant once again became concerned about an invasion of Kentucky or Ohio. Grant later said of the situation, [...] "If I had been Hood, I would have gone to Louisville and on north <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to Chicago." [...] His concern doubtless reflected Abraham Lincoln's concern. Lincoln had little patience for slow generals and remarked of the situation, [...] "This seems like the McClellan and Rosecrans strategy of do nothing and let the rebels raid the country." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well then, Charter," [...] {{the pirate}} continued, [...] "I shall leave you {{in charge of}} this vessel <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> back, which will be before dark." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{question}} {{must stand}} over <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> back," [...] Vane resumed. [...] "I'm {{going up the}} west coast shortly and may be away some little time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good! Stay here <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> back or call you; I'm {{going to}} talk to these fellows. But if you value your life, don't YOU speak nor stir." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{directed}} mindfulness {{so that it}} {{was keeping}} closely aware of the mind, following it to know what happens at death. Mindfulness stayed with the heart right up to the final moment when only the barest awareness remained. A feeling was present that to release that faint degree of awareness would be death. At this point, the question became whether {{it would be better for}} me to let go and allow death to take place. I felt that my heart was currently quite pure and that if I were to let go, I wouldn't lose because of it. Although there also remained a delicate feeling that expressed the thought that: 'rather than letting go and die, by remaining alive, I could continue to be of benefit to other people. If it were all to finish here with my death, then it could only be to my own purely personal advantage. Also, people wouldn't know the full circumstances and causes of this death. If that's the case, it's certainly better not to let myself die.' I therefore attempted to wiggle and move my hands and feet, <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> around." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mike {{is played}} by Harry Shum, Jr. He has also been portrayed as a very young boy by Evan Kishiyama in the episode [...] "The Substitute". When Shum was hired, he had been through the {{audition}} process, {{but as far as}} he knew [...] "it was just like a regular acting gig where you go on for a day." [...] In an interview with the New York Post, he elaborated, [...] "I got hired as a day player and it turned into a week, and then a month and so on. I was just rolling with it—I mean, who would say no to that?" [...] Mike performed in the glee club's production numbers, but was given very little dialogue, staying mostly [...] "in the background, doing some facial expressions." [...] Shum noted, [...] "It wasn’t <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> on the [...] tour and had this crazy reaction from the audience, and the producers were like, 'Wow, how do they know him? Mike is a senior in the third season of the show. Glee co-creator Ryan Murphy has stated that, due to graduation, [...] "more characters are leaving than are staying" [...] {{at the end of the}} season. Mike's parents are dealing with his college plans and appear on the show in [...] "Asian F" [...] to this end, and may be recurring characters.|$|E
2500|$|In 210, after Lu Su succeeded Zhou Yu (who died {{of illness}} earlier that year) as the {{frontline}} commander of Sun Quan's forces, he passed by Lü Meng's garrison {{on his way}} to Lukou (陸口; at Lushui Lake near present-day Chibi, Hubei). Lu Su had all along regarded Lü Meng with contempt, but someone told him, [...] "General Lü's fame and glory are increasing day by day. You shouldn't view him in the same light now as you did in the past. You should visit him soon." [...] Lu Su then headed to Lü Meng's camp. After some drinks, Lü Meng asked Lu Su, [...] "You've received an important appointment and you're going to be stationed near Guan Yu. Have you made any contingency plans to deal with unforeseen circumstances?" [...] Lu Su lackadaisically replied, [...] "I'll adapt to the situation when the time comes." [...] Lü Meng then said, [...] "The east and the west may be one family now, but Guan Yu is nonetheless a person with the might of bears and tigers. How can you not make preparations beforehand?" [...] Lü Meng then proposed five strategies to Lu Su {{on how to deal with}} Guan Yu. Lu Su left his seat, came closer to Lü Meng, placed his hand on his shoulder and said, [...] "Lü Ziming, I never knew you had such insights <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> here." [...] He also visited Lü Meng's mother and left after befriending Lü Meng.|$|E

60|$|So I read, Heaven knows how, for the {{situation}} was trying enough, <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to the crucial questions, when I gave the book back.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{will find}} Mr. Smedley for you," [...] Virginia said, [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>come</b> down. <b>I</b> {{am sure that}} he is not in the library, because my uncle uses that always as his private room. Please wait here <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> down." ...|$|R

6000|$|Rupert shrugged. [...] "We {{will let}} it go and wait until news about the {{soldiers}} arrives. In the meantime, I have some preparations to make. You can sleep <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> back. Nobody will disturb you." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Then," [...] responded Lisle, {{hiding his}} compassion, [...] "you'll {{have to decide}} which of two things you'll do--you can stay here <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> back, or {{you can take the}} trail with me. I must go on." ...|$|R
