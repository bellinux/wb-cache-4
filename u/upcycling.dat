25|$|The Coop {{collects}} {{a variety}} of hard-to-recycle plastic packaging for <b>upcycling.</b> This recycling initiative started with the collecting of yogurt cups to be upcycled into toothbrushes and other personal care goods by Recycline in 2008, {{at a time when}} New York City's municipal recycling limited the types of plastic accepted. With changes in NYC's trash recycling policies, the Park Slope Food Coop put together the hard-to-recycle plastics collection currently in place with Terracycle for single serve baby food pouches, plastic cling wrap, produce bags, toothbrushes, toothpaste tubes, and water filters.|$|E

5000|$|In 2009, Belinda Smith from Reuters {{wrote that}} <b>upcycling</b> had {{increased}} in the rich countries but observed that <b>upcycling</b> was a necessity in poorer ones: Supporters of the environmentally friendly practice of <b>upcycling</b> say people in developing countries have effectively been <b>upcycling</b> for years, using old packaging and clothing in new ways, although more out of need than for the environment. But <b>upcycling</b> is now taking off in other countries, reflecting an increased interest in eco-friendly products, particularly ones that are priced at an affordable level and proving profitable for the manufacturers. [...] "If <b>upcycling</b> {{is going to become}} mainstream, then the corporate world needs to see that it can be profitable," [...] said Albe Zakes, spokesman of U.S. company TerraCycle which specializes in finding new uses for discarded packaging. A growing number of companies are focusing on <b>upcycling</b> although the trend {{is still in its infancy}} with industry-wide figures yet to be produced.|$|E

50|$|Max Zorn is a Dutch tape {{artist who}} creates artwork from {{ordinary}} brown packaging tape and hangs pieces on street lamps {{as a new}} form of street art at night.

50|$|Trashion is a {{philosophy}} and an ethic encompassing environmentalism and innovation. Making traditional objects out of recycled materials can be trashion, as can making avant-garde fashion from cast-offs or junk. It springs from {{a desire to}} make the best use of limited resources. Trashion is similar to <b>upcycling</b> and refashion, although it began with specific fashion aspirations. Like <b>upcycling,</b> trashion generates items that are valued again, but these may be low-cost or high-cost, perhaps depending on the skill of the artist. The environmental aim of trashion is {{to call attention to the}} polluting outcome of waste.|$|E

5000|$|Tonnes of wastes are {{produced}} {{every day in}} our cities, and some educators are attempting to raise citizens' awareness, especially the youth. To redefine the concept of recycling previously confined to trash categorization, groups of young designers have attempted to transform [...] "trash" [...] into potentially marketable products such as backpacks made of waste plastic bags. One relevant book published by Community Museum Project in Hong Kong in 2010, was the first experiment on <b>upcycling</b> systems design. Spanning across material collecting, <b>upcycling</b> design, local production and public dissemination, it provides proposals towards a sustainable system that will cast impact on our strategies of waste handling and energy saving.|$|E

50|$|In {{consumer}} electronics, {{the process}} of re-manufacturing or refurbishment of second-hand products {{can be seen as}} <b>upcycling</b> because of the reduced energy and material consumption in contrast to new manufacturing.

50|$|<b>Upcycling</b> is the {{opposite}} of downcycling, which is {{the other half of the}} recycling process. Downcycling involves converting materials and products into new materials of lesser quality. Most recycling involves converting or extracting useful materials from a product and creating a different product or material.|$|E

50|$|Many {{industrial}} processes, like {{plastic and}} electronic fabrication, {{rely on the}} consumption of finite resources. Furthermore, the waste may have an environmental impact and can affect human health. Within this context, <b>upcycling</b> describes the use of available and future technologies to reduce waste and resource consumption by creating a product with a higher value from waste or byproduct streams.INDUSTRIAL <b>UPCYCLING</b> is new complex methodology for waste prevention. In late 2015 on logistics conference LOGISTICS RIDE, Ostrava, Czech Republic, it was named {{for the first time}} INDUSTRY 5.0. It consist of tools and methods streamlining the production surplus from one process or factory to next one. The originator of the complex methodology is Michael Rada, who started successful implementation within Czech republic industrial environment and expand to other locations.|$|E
50|$|<b>Upcycling</b> is {{the title}} of the German edition of a book first {{published}} in English in 1998 by Gunter Pauli under the title Upsizing (the opposite of downsizing). The German edition was adapted to the German language and culture by Johannes F. Hartkemeyer, then Director of the Volkshochschule in Osnabruck. The concept was later incorporated by William McDonough and Michael Braungart in their 2002 book Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things. They state that the goal of <b>upcycling</b> is to prevent wasting potentially useful materials by making use of existing ones. This reduces the consumption of new raw materials when creating new products. Reducing the use of new raw materials can result in a reduction of energy usage, air pollution, water pollution and even greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E

5000|$|Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things is a 2002 non-fiction book by German chemist Michael Braungart and U.S. {{architect}} William McDonough. It is {{a manifesto}} detailing {{how to achieve}} their Cradle to Cradle Design model. It calls for a radical change in industry: a switch from a cradle-to-grave pattern to a cradle-to-cradle pattern. It suggests that the [...] "reduce reuse recycle" [...] methods perpetuate this cradle-to-grave strategy, and that more changes need to be made. The book discourages downcycling, but rather encourages the manufacture of products {{with the goal of}} <b>upcycling</b> in mind. This vision of <b>upcycling</b> is based on a system of [...] "lifecycle development" [...] initiated by Braungart and colleagues at the Environmental Protection Encouragement Agency in the 1990s: after products have reached the end of their useful life, they become either [...] "biological nutrients" [...] or [...] "technical nutrients". Biological nutrients are materials that can re-enter the environment. Technical nutrients are materials that remain within closed-loop industrial cycles.|$|E
