40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{a new and}} {{innovative}} system of <b>perimeter</b> <b>walls</b> is presented in which <b>perimeter</b> <b>walls</b> of buildings, in addition to separating inner and outer space, function as Tuned Mass Dampers (TMDs), and considerably reduce the structural responses to seismic excitations. Furthermore, compared to conventional TMDs, this system occupies much less space and also does not impose more gravitational forces on the structure. Performance of <b>perimeter</b> <b>walls</b> as TMDs was modelled by OpenSees and MATLAB Software by nonlinear dynamic time history analysis and the mass and stiffness of the damper springs were determined. Subsequently, the impact of damper location in the structure was further investigated...|$|R
