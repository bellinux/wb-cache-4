5|$|Solar and lunar eclipses were {{considered}} to be especially dangerous events that could bring catastrophe <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> In the Dresden Codex, a solar eclipse is represented by a serpent devouring the k'in ("day") hieroglyph. Eclipses were interpreted as the sun or moon being bitten, and lunar tables were recorded in order that the Maya might be able to predict them, and perform the appropriate ceremonies to ward off disaster.|$|E
5|$|For {{the scene}} of the Prometheus descent to the alien moon LV-223, visual effects art {{director}} Steven Messing referenced NASA imagery, including vortex cloud structures. He also used aerial photographs of locations in Iceland and Wadi Rum shot by VFX supervisor Richard Stammers and his team. Messing painted over these images and combined them with 3D set extensions to create a realistic altered landscape. Scott wanted the ship's descent scenes {{to have a sense of}} grandeur to contrast the dark and shrouded descent featured in Alien. Much of LV-223s world was based <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> visited in Alien, but scaled back as Scott felt some elements were too unrealistic. Other influences were the Martian mountain Olympus Mons and several large mountain structures on Earth. NASA advisers provided concepts for the aesthetics of alien worlds which were incorporated into the design work. MPC developed a digital representation of Wadi Rum using the design material, modified it to locate the alien pyramid and a landing area for the Prometheus, and resized the planet's natural features relative to the alien structures.|$|E

25|$|Thus, Kumar {{sees the}} task of {{scholars}} of media and culture as twofold: “to explain and critique the state of culture and society, and then to act <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> to change it. In taking up this challenge, classical Marxism {{as a guide to}} action has much to offer” (85). In addition, this type of work is possible according to Kumar due to the contradictory nature of media: “Media texts are contradictory, as all reality is contradictory. And contradiction allows for change within the totality of social relations. This change is the product of human beings resisting their conditions of oppression and exploitation” (p.84).|$|E

25|$|The party's {{distinctive}} logo {{was designed}} in 1968 by painter and poet Roland Giguère. It {{consists of a}} stylised letter Q, represented by a blue circle broken by a red arrow. The creator meant it as an allegory of the Parti Québécois breaking the circle of colonialism which he claimed Canada was imposing on Quebec and opening Quebec <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> and the future. The PQ has made very few significant modifications to its logo during its history. In 1985 it made the circle and arrow slightly thicker, and placed {{the tip of the}} latter at the centre of the circle. The original saw it span the whole diameter. When placed upon a blue background instead of a white one, the circle was commonly turned to white, the single main design variation currently observed.|$|E
25|$|One month later, Haile made a {{surprise}} {{return to the}} track {{for the first of}} two stadium races that summer. In the first, he ran a 26:52.81 in finishing fifth in a very competitive 10,000 metres race in Hengelo, The Netherlands. Then, on 27 June 2007, Haile launched an attack <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> record for the one hour run, in Ostrava, Czech Republic. This record attempt was successful as Haile passed the hour mark at 21,285metres (13 miles 397 yards), eclipsing the previous best of 21,101metres, set by Mexican Arturo Barrios in La Flèche, France, on 30 March 1991. Furthermore, Haile covered 50 laps (20,000m) in 56:25.98, another world best, well within the previous 56:55.6 also set by Barrios in 1991. These were his 23rd and 24th world records.|$|E

He intends to throw the nation into a depression with the help of corrupt financier Moseley, but the story ends with Superman defeating him.|$|E
