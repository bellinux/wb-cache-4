40|$|Background: Lymphoscintigraphy {{has become}} a routine {{examination}} for identifying the sentinel lymph node in various cancer patients. Despite increasing clinical information, the basic anatomy of the superficial lymphatic system of the <b>upper</b> <b>torso</b> has not been fully elucidated. Methods: Five female breasts, three anterior chest walls, and three forequarter specimens from fresh nine cadavers (two male and seven female) were used for this study. Our original radiographic method for delineating the lymphatics was applied. The course of the lymph vessels was traced from the x-ray films and color coded {{in accordance with their}} sentinel lymph node to define the lymph territories of the <b>upper</b> <b>torso.</b> In addition, cross-sectional studies were performed on the female breasts to demonstrate the three-dimensional pathway and connections of the lymphatic vessels. Results: The lymphatic territories of the <b>upper</b> <b>torso</b> were divided by the midaxillary line. The anterior side drained into the external mammary or axillary vein lymph nodes and the posterior side drained into the scapular nodes. There {{was no significant difference between}} sexes. In most cases, one sentinel lymph node in the axilla notably covered a large lymph territory in both the upper arm and the <b>upper</b> <b>torso.</b> Conclusions: The authors have demonstrated by radiography and dissection the superficial lymphatics of the <b>upper</b> <b>torso</b> in male and female cadavers. The lymph vessels originating in the lower region of the <b>upper</b> <b>torso</b> have close spatial association with the breast tissue and seemed to play a key role in the breast lymph drainage. 9 page(s...|$|R

30|$|These {{differences}} in sound between the ears {{give rise to}} binaural cues such as the interaural time difference (ITD) and interaural level difference (ILD). These cues depend {{on a variety of}} factors, notably the shape of the head, pinnae, and <b>upper</b> <b>torso.</b> All of these can be affected by the distance the sound travels to each ear, attenuation due to occlusion (the head shadow effect), and reflections (from the <b>upper</b> <b>torso</b> and the pinnae). In addition, the pinna creates direction-dependent spectral cues that can be used by the brain to infer source direction.|$|R

40|$|Objective This study {{evaluated}} the moderating effects {{of sexual orientation}} and exercise status on measures of body image and eating disturbance {{in a sample of}} men. Method One hundred and thirty-four men completed measures designed to index a range of body image facets (ideals, actual, partner 2 ̆ 7 s preference, overall dissatisfaction), eating disturbance (restrictive and bulimic levels), and overall self-esteem. Results There were few significant effects as a function of exercise status or sexual orientation. Bodybuilders were more satisfied on a global measure of body image and had a higher ideal and actual <b>upper</b> <b>torso</b> size rating. Gay men had a smaller actual <b>upper</b> <b>torso</b> rating than heterosexual men, but ideal size <b>upper</b> <b>torso</b> did not differ as a function of sexual orientation. Discussion Findings are discussed in terms of methodological limits of previous work and future examinations of moderating factors for body image and eating disturbance in men. © 2002 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
