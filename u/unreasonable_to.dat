5|$|By October 1943, the fractious {{relationship}} came to {{the surface}} again. Galland met with Göring at Göring's estate, Schloss Veldenstein. During the conversation {{the need for new}} and improved interceptor aircraft arose. The demands made by Göring, that heavily cannon-armed fighters be used in mass numbers to defeat bomber formations, were <b>unreasonable</b> <b>to</b> Galland. Göring, prompted by the desires of Hitler, wanted cannons of some 2,000 lb in weight which fired at a rate of one shell per second. Galland explained that such a weapon could not be used effectively in an aircraft; the cannon would be prone to jamming and the aircraft would be too difficult to manoeuvre. Galland also asserted the use of inappropriate weaponry such as the Messerschmitt Me 410, a favourite of Hitler's, had caused heavy losses. Galland argued such measures were deplorable and irresponsible. Göring ignored Galland's arguments and continued his frequent attacks on the fighter force, accusing them of cowardice. Galland, as he always did, defended them, risking his career and, {{near the end of the}} war, his life in doing so. Galland stated that he could not agree to follow Göring's plans and requested to be dismissed from his post and sent back to his unit. Göring accepted, but two weeks later he apologised to Galland and attributed his behaviour to stress. Galland continued in his post.|$|E
25|$|The global {{license is}} a {{realistic}} measure {{in the long}} run.

25|$|Similarly, a {{polynomial}} time algorithm is not always practical.

Indeed, in practice even n3 or n2 algorithms are often impractical on realistic sizes of problems.|$|E

It is <b>unreasonable</b> <b>to</b> expect Norwegian consumers to have comprehensive knowledge of English law.

25|$|One Mormon apologist {{argues that}} few chariot {{fragments}} {{have been found}} in the Middle East dating to Biblical times (apart from the disassembled chariots found in Tutankhamun's tomb), and therefore wheeled chariots did exist in the Book of Mormon timeframe and it would not be <b>unreasonable</b> <b>to</b> assume that archaeologists have not yet discovered any evidence of them.|$|E

25|$|Much of {{the book}} is spent {{describing}} the state of the environment and the food security situation, which is described as increasingly dire. Ehrlich argues that as the existing population was not being fed adequately, and as it was growing rapidly it was <b>unreasonable</b> <b>to</b> expect sufficient improvements in food production to feed everyone. He further argued that the growing population placed escalating strains on all aspects of the natural world.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{government}} policy to reduce identity to “just a Rwandan one” has only “been {{successful in the}} public sphere of government rhetoric and bureaucracy.” In fact, ethnicity still remains socially relevant. Its salience however has been transferred into the private sphere—a space that may make the divisions even more destructive. Thus, the concept of “eliminating” ethnicity is problematic in both concept and reality—as it is <b>unreasonable</b> <b>to</b> expect such a drastic change in the Rwandan perception.|$|E
25|$|Laws {{regulating}} the discharge {{and treatment of}} sewage have led to dramatic nutrient reductions to surrounding ecosystems, but it is generally agreed that a policy regulating agricultural use of fertilizer and animal waste must be imposed. In Japan the amount of nitrogen produced by livestock is adequate to serve the fertilizer needs for the agriculture industry. Thus, it is not <b>unreasonable</b> <b>to</b> command livestock owners to clean up animal waste—which when left stagnant will leach into ground water.|$|E

25|$|In 1978, another lawsuit {{over the}} Pageant of Peace was filed. The {{government}} had banned all groups {{not associated with}} the Pageant of Peace from the Ellipse (even though it only used a one-fourth of the Ellipse's total area for the pageant), but permitted them to use lightly wooded areas nearby. The government argued {{that it had to}} avoid any appearance of government sponsorship of any religion and to be even-handed with all groups. The Christian Service Corps sued, arguing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on December 16, 1978, that it was <b>unreasonable</b> <b>to</b> keep all groups off the Ellipse during this time. On December 20, the court ruled that the Park Service's rules did not violate Christian Service Corps' constitutional rights.|$|E
25|$|Monte Verde {{is located}} 8,000 {{miles south of}} the Bering Strait. Such a {{considerable}} distance was probably <b>unreasonable</b> <b>to</b> trek by foot, especially on ice. Furthermore, remains of 22 varieties of seaweed are referenced in regards to this theory. Modern native inhabitants of the regions use these particular local seaweed varieties for medicinal purposes. Using an ethnographic analogy, this suggests that the Monte Verde residents used these varieties for similar purposes, which further suggests an extensive knowledge of marine resources. Together with a relative lack of stone tools, it appears that these first settlers were maritime-adapted hunter-gatherer-fishermen, and not necessarily big-game hunters like the Clovis. Therefore, it is feasible that they traveled along the coast by boat or along the shoreline, and could survive on marine resources throughout the voyage south.|$|E
25|$|The {{directive}} {{seems to}} suggest that discovery of the defect must be impossible while the UK implementation seems to broaden the defence to situations where, while it would have been possible to discover the defect, it would have been <b>unreasonable</b> <b>to</b> expect the producer to do so. This difference led the Commission of the European Union to bring legal action against the UK in 1989. As there was at that time no UK case law on the defence, the European Court of Justice found that {{there was no evidence that}} the UK was interpreting the defence more broadly than the wording of the directive. This is likely to ensure that the UK legislation is interpreted to be consistent with the directive in the future, as was the case in A & Others v. National Blood Authority where the judge referred to the directive rather than the UK legislation.|$|E

25|$|In Holt v. City of Maumelle, 817 S.W.2d 208 (AR., 1991), Mr. Steele Holt {{sued the}} city of Maumelle, Arkansas in 1988 {{in an attempt to}} have its {{prohibition}} against pit bulls overturned {{on the grounds that the}} ordinance was impermissibly vague, that it was <b>unreasonable</b> <b>to</b> ban pit bull-type dogs, and that the city's Board of Directors committed a breach of contract by passing a pit bull ordinance that it had previously agreed to forego; Mr. Holt also asked that the city pay compensatory damages, punitive damages, and his attorney's fees. The Pulaski County circuit court made a summary judgment dismissing the suit, and Mr. Holt appealed. In 1991, the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed the circuit court's decision, finding that the pit bull ordinance was not impermissibly vague, that the restrictions were reasonable, and that any agreement made by the city to limit its own legislative powers was null and void since the city's first duty was to protect the public interest.|$|E
25|$|Any {{wars that}} did occur, and any marriages for that matter, {{occurred}} between sites {{at an average}} distance of 38km (Manzanilla, 1997). This brings {{the idea that there}} was violence at this site. Manzanilla (1997) also states the Dorado stresses the difficulty of maintaining widespread territorial control in the tropical rainforest and that strength is based on kinship ties. However, there are several key pieces of evidence missing for any further conclusions. The architecture does not suggest any preparation for warfare, through the lack of walls and other fortifications. It is hard to make any conclusions based on the burials described above due to the sheer lack of a data set. Furthermore, there are no written records of violence Oxkintok, nor are there evidences of tributes received/paid or of conquest. Through the lack of so many indicators of violence and warfare, it isn't <b>unreasonable</b> <b>to</b> conclude that Oxkintok was not frequently involved in large scale violence.|$|E
25|$|The fact of {{the embassy}} cannot be doubted. The {{distinguished}} ambassadors visited the Hun's camp near the south shore of Lake Garda. It is also certain that Attila suddenly retreated. But {{we are at a}} loss to know what considerations were offered him to induce him to depart. It is <b>unreasonable</b> <b>to</b> suppose that this heathen king would have cared for the thunders or persuasions of the Church. The Emperor refused to surrender Honoria, and it is not recorded that money was paid. A trustworthy chronicle hands down another account which does not conflict with the fact that an embassy was sent, but evidently furnishes the true reasons which moved Attila to receive it favourably. Plague broke out in the barbarian host and their food ran short, {{and at the same time}} troops arrived from the east, sent by Marcian to the aid of Italy. If his host was suffering from pestilence, and if troops arrived from the east, we can understand that Attila was forced to withdraw. But whatever terms were arranged, he did not pretend that they meant a permanent peace. The question of Honoria was left unsettled, and he threatened that he would come again and do worse things in Italy unless she were given up with the due portion of the Imperial possessions.|$|E

500|$|The {{commission}} report described redeveloping Plough Lane, which Merton Council insisted remained viable [...] "if {{there is a}} will for the club to pursue this option", as the only recourse for Wimbledon other than Milton Keynes. A feasibility study carried out by Drivers Jonas, commissioned and funded jointly by Wimbledon F.C. and Merton Council, described a 20,000-capacity stadium at Plough Lane as physically possible but [...] "extremely ambitious", risky and financially unsustainable given the club's money problems. The commission ruled that it was <b>unreasonable</b> <b>to</b> expect Wimbledon's owners to pursue a move back to Plough Lane under these circumstances. Parker and Stride concluded that on the evidence presented Milton Keynes was the only option {{that would give the}} club a chance of financial survival, and therefore ruled in favour of the move, two to one—Turvey dissented—on 28 May 2002.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{regard the}} Zoo TV Tour {{as one of}} rock's most memorable tours.

In 1997, Robert Hilburn wrote that [...] "It's not <b>unreasonable</b> <b>to</b> {{think of it as}} the Sgt. Pepper's of rock tours." [...] In 2002, Tom Doyle of Q called it [...] "still the most {{spectacular}} rock tour staged by any band", and in 2013, the magazine listed it as one of the [...] "ten greatest gigs of all time". In 2009, critic Greg Kot said, [...] "Zoo TV remains the finest supersized tour mounted by any band in the last two decades." [...] Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork wrote in a review of Achtung Babys 20th anniversary reissue, [...] "Even 20 years on, the tour looks like something to behold, a singularly inventive experience that no band—including U2 itself—has been able to really expound upon in a meaningful way." [...] Rolling Stone included the tour on its 2017 list of [...] "The 50 Greatest Concerts of the Last 50 Years".|$|E
