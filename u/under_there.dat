This bytecode is the same no matter what hardware or operating system the program is running <b>under.</b> <b>There</b> is a JIT (Just In Time) compiler within the Java Virtual Machine, or JVM.

2500|$|Nehru, while a pacifist, was not {{blind to}} the {{political}} and geostrategic reality of India in 1947. While laying the foundation stone of the National Defence Academy in 1949, he stated: [...] "We, who for generations had talked about and attempted in everything a peaceful way and practised non-violence, should now be, in a sense, glorifying our army, navy and air force. It means a lot. Though it is odd, yet it simply reflects the oddness of life. Though life is logical, {{we have to face}} all contingencies, and unless we are prepared to face them, we will go <b>under.</b> <b>There</b> was no greater prince of peace and apostle of non-violence than Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation, whom we have lost, but yet, he said it was better to take the sword than to surrender, fail or run away. We cannot live carefree assuming that we are safe. Human nature is such. We cannot take the risks and risk our hard-won freedom. We have to be prepared with all modern defense methods and a well-equipped army, navy and air force." ...|$|E

60|$|As I sat {{brooding}} {{over this}} fancied insult, however, I smelt rum; and {{looking down the}} sky-light, saw this same steward passing forward with a pot filled with the liquor. I was fairly blinded with passion. Running down, I met the fellow, {{just as he was}} coming out of the cabin, and brought him up all standing. The man carried a knife along his leg, a weapon that had caused a good deal of uneasiness in the brig, and he now reached down to get it. Seeing {{there was no time to}} parley, I raised him from the floor, and threw him down with great force, his head coming <b>under.</b> <b>There</b> he lay like a log, and all my efforts with vinegar and water had no visible effect.|$|E
60|$|I {{spoke of}} the {{underground}} Virginia as a city. The Gould and Curry is only one single mine <b>under</b> <b>there,</b> among a great many others; yet the Gould and Curry's streets of dismal drifts and tunnels were five miles in extent, altogether, and its population five hundred miners. Taken as a whole, the underground city had some thirty miles of streets and a population {{of five or six}} thousand. In this present day some of those populations are at work from twelve to sixteen hundred feet under Virginia and Gold Hill, and the signal-bells that tell them what the superintendent above ground desires them to do are struck by telegraph as we strike a fire alarm. Sometimes men fall down a shaft, there, a thousand feet deep. In such cases, the usual plan is to hold an inquest.|$|E

The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females there were 93.80 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 90.80 males. However, these data are distorted by female longevity. As verified by 2000 U.S. Census, for every 100 females <b>under</b> 65 <b>there</b> were 98.7 males, for every 100 females <b>under</b> 55 <b>there</b> were 99.5 males, and for every 100 females <b>under</b> 20 <b>there</b> were 105 males.|$|R

In all good faith he returned at night and remonstrated with Roop upon his extravagant decision, and implored him to walk the floor and think for half an hour, {{and see if he}} could not figure out some sort of modification of the verdict. Roop yielded at last and got up to walk. He walked two hours and a half, and at last his face lit up happily and he told Buncombe it had occurred to him that the ranch underneath the new Morgan ranch still belonged to Hyde, that his title to the ground was just as good as it had ever been, and therefore he was of opinion that Hyde had a right to dig it out from <b>under</b> <b>there</b> and-- ...|$|E
60|$|The current {{running down}} the Atchafalaya was very swift, the Mississippi showing a predilection in that direction, which needs only {{to be seen to}} enforce the opinion of that river's desperate endeavors to find a short way to the Gulf. Small boats, skiffs, pirogues, etc., are in great demand, and many have been stolen by piratical negroes, who take them where they will bring the {{greatest}} price. From what was told me by Mr. C. P. Ferguson, a planter near Red River Landing, whose place has just gone <b>under,</b> <b>there</b> is much suffering in the rear of that place. The negroes had given up all thoughts of a crevasse there, as the upper levee had stood so long, and when it did come they were at its mercy. On Thursday a number were taken out of trees and off of cabin roofs and brought in, many yet remaining.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{people had}} arrived {{from all parts}} of the Bazaar. Luck, the ledger clerk, blundered against Polly and said, [...] "Help him!" [...] Somerville from the silks vaulted the counter, and seized a chair by the back. Polly lost his head. He clawed at the Bolton {{sheeting}} before him, and if he could have detached a piece he would certainly have hit somebody with it. As it was he simply upset the pile. It fell away from Polly, and he had an impression of somebody squeaking as it went down. It was the sort of impression one disregards. The collapse of the pile of goods just sufficed to end his subconscious efforts to get something to hit somebody with, and his whole attention focussed itself upon the struggle in the window. For a splendid instant Parsons towered up over the active backs that clustered about the shop window door, an active whirl of gesture, tearing things down and throwing them, and then he went <b>under.</b> <b>There</b> was an instant's furious struggle, a crash, a second crash and the crack of broken plate glass. Then a stillness and heavy breathing.|$|E

6000|$|... "Indeed I am not. I wish {{with all}} my heart I could say that I was joking. It's a fact, boy. You know I have not been long in the force, yet I've gone to as many as six fires in one night, and we often go to two or three. The one {{we are going to see}} the remains of just now was too far from us for our engine to turn out; but we got the call to send a man on, and I was sent. When I arrived and {{reported}} myself to Mr Braidwood, the two top floors were burnt out, and the fire was nearly got <b>under.</b> <b>There</b> were three engines, and the men were up on the window-sills of the second-floor with the branches, playin' on the last of the flames, while the men of the salvage-corps were getting the furniture out of the first floor. Conductor Brown was there with his escape, and had saved a whole family from the top floor, just before I arrived. He had been changed from his old station at the West End that very day. He's a wonderful fellow, that conductor! Many a life he has saved; but, indeed, the same may be said of most of the men in the force, especially the old hands. Here we are, lad. This is the house." ...|$|E
6000|$|To these {{troubles}} succeeds the turning-out scene, {{when the}} whole caravan is ejected into the gentlemen's cabin, that the beds may be made. The red curtains are put down, and in solemn silence all, the last mysterious preparations begin. At length it is announced that all is ready. Forthwith the whole company rush back, and find the walls embellished {{by a series of}} little shelves, about a foot wide, each furnished with a mattress and bedding, and hooked to the ceiling by a very suspiciously slender cord. Direful are the ruminations and exclamations of inexperienced travellers, particularly young ones, as they eye these very equivocal accommodations. [...] "What, sleep up there! I won't sleep on one of those top shelves, I know. The cords will certainly break." [...] The chambermaid here takes up the conversation, and solemnly assures them that such an accident is not to be thought of at all; that it is a natural impossibility--a thing that could not happen without an actual miracle; and since it becomes increasingly evident that thirty ladies cannot all sleep on the lowest shelf, there is some effort made to exercise faith in this doctrine; nevertheless, all look on their neighbors with fear and trembling; and when the stout lady talks of taking a shelf, she is most urgently pressed to change places with her alarmed neighbor below. Points of location being after a while adjusted, comes the last struggle. Every body wants to take off a bonnet, or look for a shawl, to find a cloak, or get a carpet bag, and all set about it with such zeal that nothing can be done. [...] "Ma'am, you're on my foot!" [...] says one. [...] "Will you please to move, ma'am?" [...] says somebody, who is gasping and struggling behind you. [...] "Move!" [...] you echo. [...] "Indeed, I should be very glad to, but I don't see much prospect of it." [...] "Chambermaid!" [...] calls a lady, who is struggling among a heap of carpet bags and children {{at one end of the}} cabin. [...] "Ma'am!" [...] echoes the poor chambermaid, who is wedged fast, in a similar situation, at the other. [...] "Where's my cloak, chambermaid?" [...] "I'd find it, ma'am, if I could move." [...] "Chambermaid, my basket!" [...] "Chambermaid, my parasol!" [...] "Chambermaid, my carpet bag!" [...] "Mamma, they push me so!" [...] "Hush, child; crawl <b>under</b> <b>there,</b> and lie still till I can undress you." [...] At last, however, the various distresses are over, the babies sink to sleep, and even that much-enduring being, the chambermaid, seeks out some corner for repose. Tired and drowsy, you are just sinking into a doze, when bang! goes the boat against the sides of a lock; ropes scrape, men run and shout, and up fly the heads of all the top shelfites, who are generally the more juvenile and airy part of the company.|$|E
