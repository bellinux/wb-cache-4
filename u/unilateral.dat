5|$|The Pythagorean tiling may be {{generalized}} to a three-dimensional tiling of Euclidean space by cubes of two different sizes, which also is <b>unilateral</b> and equitransitive. Attila Bölcskei calls this three-dimensional tiling the Rogers filling. He conjectures that, in any dimension greater than three, there is again a unique <b>unilateral</b> and equitransitive way of tiling space by hypercubes of two different sizes.|$|E
5|$|A specific, {{recognizable}} {{feature of}} Purkinje neurons is {{the expression of}} calbindin. Calbindin staining of rat brain after <b>unilateral</b> chronic sciatic nerve injury suggests that Purkinje neurons may be newly generated in the adult brain, initiating the organization of new cerebellar lobules.|$|E
5|$|During his 2008 candidacy, Gravel {{called for}} a cut in {{military}} spending, variously reported to be 15 percent or 50 percent. He called for the savings to boost public education spending. To spur international nuclear nonproliferation efforts, Gravel called for <b>unilateral</b> reductions in the U.S. nuclear arsenal.|$|E
5|$|In Ortner's {{syndrome}} or cardiovocal syndrome, a rare {{cause of}} left recurrent laryngeal nerve , expansion of structures within the heart or major blood vessels impinges upon the nerve, causing symptoms of <b>unilateral</b> nerve injury.|$|E
5|$|Stage 3: Tumor infiltrating across midline with {{or without}} {{regional}} lymph node involvement; or <b>unilateral</b> tumor with contralateral lymph node involvement; or midline tumor with bilateral lymph node involvement.|$|E
5|$|The Pythagorean tiling is {{the unique}} tiling by squares of two {{different}} sizes that is both <b>unilateral</b> (no two squares have a common side) and equitransitive (each two squares {{of the same size}} can be mapped into each other by a symmetry of the tiling).|$|E
5|$|<b>Unilateral</b> pudendal nerve {{neuropathy}} inconsistently causes {{fecal incontinence}} in some, but not others. This is because crossover innervation {{of the external}} anal sphincter occurs in some individuals.|$|E
5|$|A <b>unilateral</b> ceasefire was {{announced}} on 10 August by the Georgian government. An intention {{to pull out}} Georgian troops from South Ossetia was stated by the Georgian government. However, Russia did not embrace this ceasefire offer. After the ceasefire agreement was negotiated by French president Nicolas Sarkozy on 12 August, military action was to cease at 15:00 on 12 August, however Russian forces didn't stop to advance.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>Unilateral</b> Declaration of Independence (UDI), the British {{government}} {{petitioned the}} United Nations for sanctions against Rhodesia pending unsuccessful talks with Smith's administration in 1966 and 1968. In December 1966, the organisation complied, imposing the first mandatory trade embargo on an autonomous state. These sanctions were expanded again in 1968.|$|E
5|$|Britain's {{remaining}} {{colonies in}} Africa, except for self-governing Southern Rhodesia, were all granted independence by 1968. British {{withdrawal from the}} southern and eastern parts of Africa was not a peaceful process. Kenyan independence was preceded by the eight-year Mau Mau Uprising. In Rhodesia, the 1965 <b>Unilateral</b> Declaration of Independence by the white minority resulted {{in a civil war}} that lasted until the Lancaster House Agreement of 1979, which set the terms for recognised independence in 1980, as the new nation of Zimbabwe.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{emphasized}} {{a careful}} {{approach to the}} conflict between Israel and the Palestinians; he denounced Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat for his support of violence, but sponsored dialogues between Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian National Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Bush supported Sharon's <b>unilateral</b> disengagement plan, and lauded the democratic elections held in Palestine after Arafat's death.|$|E
5|$|Diplodocines have {{highly unusual}} teeth {{compared}} to other sauropods. The crowns are long and slender, and elliptical in cross-section, while the apex forms a blunt, triangular point. The most prominent wear facet is on the apex, though unlike all other wear patterns observed within sauropods, diplodocine wear patterns are on the labial (cheek) side of both {{the upper and lower}} teeth. What this means is that Diplodocus and other diplodocids had a radically different feeding mechanism than other sauropods. <b>Unilateral</b> branch stripping is the most likely feeding behavior of Diplodocus, as it explains the unusual wear patterns of the teeth (coming from tooth–food contact). In <b>unilateral</b> branch stripping, one tooth row would have been used to strip foliage from the stem, while the other would act as a guide and stabilizer. With the elongated preorbital (in front of the eyes) region of the skull, longer portions of stems could be stripped in a single action. Also, the palinal (backwards) motion of the lower jaws could have contributed two significant roles to feeding behaviour: 1) an increased gape, and 2) allowed fine adjustments of the relative positions of the tooth rows, creating a smooth stripping action.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 the Israeli cabinet withdrew its {{military}} and settlements from the Gaza Strip including the Philadelphi Route, a narrow strip {{adjacent to the}} border with Egypt, {{as part of its}} <b>unilateral</b> disengagement plan. Since the Palestinian organization, Hamas won a surprise victory in the Palestinian elections of 2006, it has been engaged in a violent power struggle with rival Palestinian organization Fatah.|$|E
5|$|On 1 October Welensky was soundly {{defeated}} by his RF opponent, with 633 votes to Dupont's 1079. In December he resigned {{the leadership of}} his party. When the RF declared <b>unilateral</b> independence on 11 November 1965, Welensky was upset at the constitutional break with Britain. He believed that Rhodesia was entitled to her independence, and disagreed with the British government's demand for 'no independence before majority rule', but was opposed to illegal action.|$|E
5|$|Rhodesia {{informed}} Britain of its {{intent to}} open a Lisbon mission headed by an accredited representative, independent from the Britain Embassy in the city, in June 1965. Whitehall refused to endorse the idea but Rhodesia continued nonetheless, and later that month appointed Harry Reedman to head the mission. The British government attempted unsuccessfully to block this <b>unilateral</b> act—Rhodesia's first—for some months afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Shoup's {{opposition}} to the war only increased over time; he initially pushed for a negotiated settlement but later supported a <b>unilateral</b> pullout from the country. As the Vietnamization strategy took effect and the U.S. increased its air operations, he remained opposed to any strategy that risked a nuclear war with China or the Soviet Union. His criticism attracted more press as the war became a stalemate. It also became highly publicized through discourse among the anti-war movement.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. has {{modified}} its stance {{since the}} 1970s, when the State Department and the CIA issued reports exploring {{the potential of}} food embargoes. Congressional Bill H.R. 5426, the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000, removed agricultural export sanctions applied to Libya, Sudan, and North Korea (agricultural trade with Cuba remained under some restrictions) and gave Congress veto power over <b>unilateral</b> presidential actions in this regard.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Unilateral</b> Declaration of Independence (UDI) was a {{statement}} adopted by the Cabinet of Rhodesia on 11 November 1965, announcing that Rhodesia, a British territory in southern Africa that had governed itself since 1923, now regarded itself as an independent sovereign state. The culmination of a protracted dispute between the British and Rhodesian governments regarding the terms under which the latter could become fully independent, {{it was the first}} <b>unilateral</b> break from the United Kingdom by one of its colonies since the United States Declaration of Independence nearly two centuries before. Britain, the Commonwealth and the United Nations all deemed Rhodesia's UDI illegal, and economic sanctions, the first in the UN's history, were imposed on the breakaway colony. Amid near-complete international isolation, Rhodesia continued as an unrecognised state with the assistance of South Africa and Portugal.|$|E
5|$|The {{diverging}} {{interests of}} the League members began to show, and the alliance began to unravel. In 1573, the Holy League fleet failed to sail altogether; instead, Don John attacked and took Tunis, only {{for it to be}} retaken by the Ottomans in 1574. Venice, fearing the loss of her Dalmatian possessions and a possible invasion of Friuli, and eager to cut her losses and resume the trade with the Ottoman Empire, initiated <b>unilateral</b> negotiations with the Porte.|$|E
5|$|This was a {{recognition}} of the de facto political situation, as the Patriarch of Constantinople was partially under the political control of the Ottoman Empire. However, faithful people—concerned that having a Catholic {{as the head of the}} Church of Greece would weaken the Orthodox Church—criticised the <b>unilateral</b> declaration of Autocephaly as non-canonical. For the same reason, they likewise resisted the foreign, mostly Protestant, missionaries who established schools throughout Greece.|$|E
5|$|While Mugabe was imprisoned, in August 1964, the Rhodesian Front government—now {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Ian Smith—banned ZANU and ZAPU and arrested all remaining leaders of the country's African nationalist movement. Smith's government made a <b>unilateral</b> declaration of independence from the United Kingdom in November 1965, renaming Southern Rhodesia as Rhodesia; the UK refused to recognise the legitimacy of this and imposed economic sanctions on the country.|$|E
5|$|Within the government, Van der Byl {{was one of}} {{the loudest}} voices urging Ian Smith to proceed to a <b>Unilateral</b> Declaration of Independence. He angrily denounced the threat of {{sanctions}} from Britain, saying on 4 May 1965 that economic destruction of Rhodesia would mean total economic destruction of Zambia, formerly Northern Rhodesia. This statement was interpreted as a military threat by David Butler, the Leader of the Opposition. Van der Byl was given the task of selling the UDI to Rhodesian whites and to world opinion. In September 1965, it was announced that he would tour the United Kingdom to promote Rhodesian independence. According to David Steel, he claimed then that France and the United States would lead the international recognition of the UDI government. He was appointed Deputy Minister of Information on 22 October and so was present at, but did not sign, the <b>Unilateral</b> Declaration of Independence on 11 November 1965.|$|E
5|$|After its creation, SEATO {{quickly became}} {{insignificant}} militarily, {{as most of}} its member nations contributed very little to the alliance. While SEATO military forces held joint military training, they were never employed because of internal disagreements. SEATO was unable to intervene in conflicts in Laos because France and the United Kingdom rejected use of military action. As a result, the U.S. provided <b>unilateral</b> support for Laos after 1962. Though sought by the U.S., involvement of SEATO in the Vietnam War was denied {{because of lack of}} British and French cooperation.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, Southern Rhodesians' {{service on}} Britain's behalf in the World Wars, {{particularly}} the Second, {{was an integral}} part of the colony's national psyche. The territory had also latterly contributed to British counter-insurgency operations in Malaya, Aden and Cyprus, as well as Operation Vantage in Kuwait. The colonial government's <b>Unilateral</b> Declaration of Independence in 1965 was deliberately made on 11 November, Armistice Day, in an attempt to emphasise the territory's prior war record on Britain's behalf. The proclamation was signed at 11:00 local time, during the customary two-minute silence to remember the fallen.|$|E
5|$|Following Rhodesia's <b>Unilateral</b> Declaration of Independence from Britain on 11 November 1965, the RLI became {{widely known}} for its {{counter-insurgency}} operations during the Rhodesian Bush War against incursions by ZAPU and ZANU's respective military wings, the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) and Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA). The Regiment acquitted itself well in several such operations, with some of its soldiers winning decorations for their actions. Some operations, such as Operations Flotilla and Excess in 1968, involved cooperation with the Portuguese Armed Forces in Mozambique.|$|E
5|$|It also {{provided}} for the Court of First Instance (now known as the General Court) to be based in Luxembourg with the Court of Justice, which remained there. However, this agreement dropped the provision from the 1965 decision, which gave priority to Luxembourg for any new judicial and financial bodies. In response, Luxembourg attached a <b>unilateral</b> declaration stating it did not renounce this article. However they did renounce any claim to {{the seat of the}} judicial Boards of Appeal of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market via the Treaty of Nice.|$|E
5|$|Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov {{informed}} Tokyo of the Soviet Union's <b>unilateral</b> abrogation of the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact on August 5. At {{two minutes}} past midnight on August 9, Tokyo time, Soviet infantry, armor, and air forces had launched the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation. Four hours later, word reached Tokyo of the Soviet Union's official declaration of war. The senior {{leadership of the}} Japanese Army began preparations to impose martial law on the nation, {{with the support of}} Minister of War Korechika Anami, in order to stop anyone attempting to make peace.|$|E
25|$|In <b>unilateral</b> ECT, both {{electrodes}} {{are placed}} {{on the same side}} of the patient's head. <b>Unilateral</b> ECT may be used first to minimize side effects such as memory loss.|$|E
25|$|Divorce in Islam, <b>unilateral</b> divorce at {{the behest}} of the husband.|$|E
25|$|Two or more meningioma plus <b>unilateral</b> VS or any two of glioma, schwannoma and cataract.|$|E
25|$|<b>Unilateral</b> {{activation}} of the amygdala due to fearful stimuli may also produce <b>unilateral</b> {{activation of}} other regions. The right middle temporal gyrus, right brainstem, left hippocampus, right cerebellum, right fuisform gyrus, and left lingual gyrus were also activated during fearful stimuli. Activation of multiple brain regions both indicates that emotions are processed {{in many parts of}} the brain and that emotions are complex.|$|E
25|$|Using {{the model}} of two <b>unilateral</b> blocks, several {{consequences}} of feedback are simply derived.|$|E
25|$|International {{media had}} descended upon East Pakistan for the speech amidst {{speculation}} that Sheikh Mujib {{would make a}} <b>unilateral</b> declaration of independence from Pakistan. However, keeping in mind the failures of Rhodesia's <b>Unilateral</b> Declaration of Independence and of the Biafra struggle in Nigeria, he {{did not make a}} direct declaration. Nevertheless, the speech was effective in giving Bengalis a clear goal of independence.|$|E
25|$|Classic presentations are abrupt {{onset of}} <b>unilateral</b> {{periorbital}} edema, headache, photophobia, and bulging {{of the eye}} (proptosis).|$|E
