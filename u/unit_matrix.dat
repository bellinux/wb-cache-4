In ground water management models, either governing equations are embedded into the management model or <b>unit</b> response <b>matrixes</b> are employed. <b>Unit</b> response <b>matrixes</b> development requires huge amount of data and/or simulation runs. In this paper, ANN is employed to develop <b>unit</b> response <b>matrix</b> coefficients to be later used in the management model. To do it, a ANN model has been trained to predict {{the outcome of the}} flow code, which results in <b>unit</b> response <b>matrix</b> coefficients for the aquifer under consideration. To train the ANN model different realizations from pumping well co-ordinates, distance between pumping and observation wells, and hydraulic conductivities of pumping wells were used, it was concluded that pumping well co-ordinates may be successfully employed for developing <b>unit</b> response <b>matrix</b> coefficients to be later used in management models. To test the performance of the proposed approach, the hypothetical aquifer was assumed. The aquifer response to different pumping stresses were compared using a well-defined simulation model and those resulted from <b>unit</b> response <b>matrixes</b> developed by (1) ANN approach and (2) direct data from groundwater simulation runs. It was concluded that ANN may be successfully employed for development of <b>unit</b> response <b>matrix</b> with limited data from field study or ground water simulation runs...|$|R

2500|$|The Callias index theorem is {{an index}} theorem for a Dirac {{operator}} on a noncompact odd-dimensional space. [...] The Atiyah–Singer index is only defined on compact spaces, and vanishes when their dimension is odd. In 1978 Constantine Callias, {{at the suggestion}} of his Ph.D. advisor Roman Jackiw, used the axial anomaly to derive this index theorem on spaces equipped with a Hermitian matrix called the Higgs field. [...] As presented in his paper [...] the index of the Dirac operator is a topological invariant which measures the winding of the Higgs field on a sphere at infinity. [...] If U is the <b>unit</b> <b>matrix</b> {{in the direction of the}} Higgs field, then the index is proportional to the integral of U(dU)n−1 over the (n−1)-sphere at infinity. [...] If n is even, it is always zero. [...] The topological interpretation of this invariant and its relation to the Hörmander index proposed by Boris Fedosov, as generalized by Lars Hörmander, was published by Raoul Bott and Robert Thomas Seeley in the article [...] in the same issue of Communications in Mathematical Physics as Callias' article.|$|E
