Clinton voted in favor of the October 2002 Iraq War Resolution, which authorized President George W. Bush to <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> against Iraq.|$|E
5|$|Japan {{maintains}} one of {{the largest}} military budgets of any country in the world. The country's military (the Japan Self-Defense Forces) is restricted by Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right to declare war or <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> in international disputes. Accordingly, Japan's Self-Defence force is an unusual military that has never fired shots outside Japan. Japan is the highest-ranked Asian country in the Global Peace Index.|$|E

5|$|Welensky {{considered}} a federal unilateral {{declaration of independence}} when the new Northern Rhodesian constitution appeared likely to grant an African majority in its parliament. Determined at one point to prevent changes, Welensky was convinced that if he refused, the British would <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> to remove his government. Believing that preparations were being made for an invasion from Kenya, he discussed the federation's ability to repel an attack with his defence chiefs and plans were set in motion. In the end, {{the idea of a}} British invasion was one of many options considered, and did not make it past cabinet discussion.|$|E
5|$|After resigning, Aqil left Galilee for Tell el-Hesi in {{the region}} of Gaza. Around this time, Aqil married off a {{daughter}} of his to the leading Bedouin sheikh of the area, Rabbah al-Wahaidi. Bedouin raiding, now with the participation of the smaller tribes of Galilee, resumed not long after Aqil's resignation and concerns by the local merchants and European consuls were voiced to Kapuli Pasha due to the incoming harvest season for cotton and grain from Galilee and Hauran. Hasan Effendi sought to stem the tide of looting by attempting to play one Bedouin tribe off of the other. Kapuli Pasha was doubtful of this policy's effectiveness and strove to <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> instead. He personally led a contingent of troops in Galilee and ensured a peaceful harvest through the end of 1863. However, Kapuli Pasha determined that he could not keep a large, permanent military contingent in Galilee and decided to reinstate Aqil to his former position after lobbying from the British consul of Haifa.|$|E
5|$|Charles, however, decreed on 22 September {{that all}} reformers must {{reconcile}} with the Catholic faith, {{or he would}} <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> to suppress them. This prompted Melanchthon to call a meeting with Bucer and after lengthy discussions they agreed on nine theses, which they sent to Luther and to Strasbourg. The Strasbourg magistrates forwarded them to Basel and Zürich. Bucer met Luther in Coburg on 26–28 September. Luther still rejected Bucer's theses, but he encouraged him to continue the search for unity. Bucer then traveled to several southern German cities, including Ulm, Isny, Konstanz, Memmingen, and Lindau, and to the Swiss cities of Basel and Zürich. In Zurich on 12 October, he presented the articles to Zwingli, who neither opposed him nor agreed with him.|$|E

50|$|Menendez {{voted in}} favor of Authorization for <b>Use</b> of <b>Military</b> <b>Force</b> Against Terrorists, authorizing the President the <b>use</b> of <b>military</b> <b>force</b> in Afghanistan in {{response}} to the 9/11 Terrorist Attacks. In 2002, Menendez voted against the Iraq Resolution to authorize the invasion of Iraq.|$|R
50|$|To its {{south and}} east, Chile <b>used</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> and {{colonization}} to occupy Araucanía (1861-1883) and successfully dispute Argentine claims over westernmost Patagonia and the Strait of Magellan—the outbreak of war only narrowly avoided in multiple occasions.|$|R
5|$|Davis {{faced the}} most {{important}} decision of his career: to prevent reinforcement at Fort Sumter or to let it take place. He and his cabinet decided to demand that the Federal garrison surrender and, if this was refused, to <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> to prevent reinforcement before the fleet arrived. Major Anderson did not surrender. With Jefferson Davis's endorsement, Beauregard began the bombarding of the fort in the early dawn of April 12. The Confederates continued their artillery attack on Fort Sumter until it surrendered on April 14. No one {{was killed in the}} artillery duel, but the attack on the U.S. fortress meant the fighting had started. President Lincoln called up state militia to march south to recapture Federal property. In the North and South, massive rallies were held to demand immediate war. The Civil War had begun.|$|E
5|$|Various Taliban {{supplies}} were seized by coalition forces following the battle. On 13 December, British and Afghan army units located bomb factories and weapons caches {{as they moved}} further into the outskirts of Musa Qala and searched Taliban positions. At the same time, the first civilians started {{to return to the}} area, some with reports of Taliban punishments and claims of active Pakistani and Arab jihadis. A new orientation of British strategy in Helmand is to <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> to curb the influence of local drug barons, whose trade supports the insurgents. On 16 December, British troops burned an estimated £150 to £200 million worth of heroin that had been found in a drug factory and other buildings in Musa Qala.|$|E
5|$|In 269, while Claudius Gothicus (Gallienus' successor) was {{defending}} {{the borders of}} Italy and the Balkans against Germanic invasions, Zenobia was cementing her authority; Roman officials in the East were caught between loyalty to the emperor and Zenobia's increasing demands for allegiance. The timing and rationale of the queen's decision to <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> to strengthen her authority in the East is unclear; scholar Gary K. Young suggested that Roman officials refused to recognize Palmyrene authority, and Zenobia's expeditions were intended to maintain Palmyrene dominance. Another factor {{may have been the}} weakness of Roman central authority and its corresponding inability to protect the provinces, which probably convinced Zenobia {{that the only way to}} maintain stability in the East was to control the region directly. Historian Jacques Schwartz tied Zenobia's actions to her desire to protect Palmyra's economic interests, which were threatened by Rome's failure to protect the provinces. Also, according to Schwartz, the economic interests conflicted; Bostra and Egypt received trade which would have otherwise passed through Palmyra. The Tanukhids near Bostra and the merchants of Alexandria probably attempted to rid themselves of Palmyrene domination, triggering a military response from Zenobia.|$|E

25|$|In 1826, {{when the}} Sultan issued a decree abolishing the janissaries in Bosnia, Gradaščević's {{immediate}} reaction was {{not unlike that}} {{of the rest of}} the Bosnian aristocracy. Gradaščević threatened that he would <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> to subdue anybody opposed to the Sarajevo janissaries. When the janissaries killed nakibul-ešraf Nuruddin Efendi Šerifović, however, his tone shifted and he rapidly distanced himself from their cause.|$|E
25|$|As {{a direct}} result of the Crisis and in order to prevent further Soviet {{expansion}} in the region, Eisenhower asked Congress on 5 January 1957 for authorization to <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> if requested by any Middle Eastern nation to check aggression and, second, to set aside $200million to help Middle Eastern countries that desired aid from the United States. Congress granted both requests and this policy became known as the Eisenhower Doctrine.|$|E
25|$|The NATO bombing {{marked the}} second major combat {{operation}} in its history, following the 1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It {{was the first time}} that NATO had <b>used</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> without the approval of the UN Security Council.|$|R

40|$|The 1900 s saw two {{incidents}} of states <b>using</b> their <b>military</b> in civil disorder situations, {{which resulted in}} the killing of unarmed citizens. May 14, 1931 in Ådalen, marks a significant part of Swedish history and its view of the <b>use</b> of <b>military</b> <b>force.</b>   On that day, a peaceful protest march escalated, which resulted in live firing by the military stationed there to uphold law and order. This resulted in the deaths of five civilians and the prohibition of the <b>use</b> of <b>military</b> <b>force</b> in {{incidents of}} civil disorder. In 1972 in Northern Ireland a similar event took place on January 30, which is commonly known as Bloody Sunday. The Troubles were raging and resulted in protests for civil rights by nationalists. On that day a protest march escalated and the soldiers from the 1 st Battalion of the Parachute Regiment were sent in to the city and killed fifteen civilians. This marked the worst case of military abuse in The Troubles, but resulted in no further restrictions on the <b>use</b> of <b>military</b> <b>force</b> in the United Kingdom.      The issue in this thesis is how cultural factors affect states’ views of the <b>use</b> of <b>military</b> <b>force.</b> The purpose of this thesis is to increase the understanding of how two cases of the <b>use</b> of <b>military</b> <b>force</b> against civilians, can have such different outcomes and expression. The theory used in the thesis comes from the book The Culture of National Security and explains how a state’s norms, culture and identity affect its national security.     The conclusion is that a change in a state’s culture and identity affects the state’s view of the <b>use</b> of <b>military</b> <b>force.</b> Sweden had a major change in identity, which resulted in a new law against the <b>use</b> of <b>military</b> <b>force</b> in cases of civil disorder. The United Kingdom did not have a major identity change, which resulted in no major changes to policy on the <b>use</b> of <b>military</b> <b>force...</b>|$|R
25|$|Bush's four {{reasons for}} the {{invasion}} provided sufficient justification to establish bipartisan Congressional approval {{and support for the}} invasion. However, the secrecy before initiation, the speed and success of the invasion itself, and U.S. public support for it (80% public approval) did not allow Democrats to object to Bush's decision to <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>force.</b> One contemporary study suggests that Bush decided to invade for domestic political reasons, citing scarce strategic reasoning for the U.S. to invade and immediately withdraw without establishing the structure to enforce the interests that Bush used to justify the invasion.|$|E
25|$|In foreign policy, Johnson {{escalated}} American {{involvement in}} the Vietnam War. In 1964, Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which granted Johnson the power to <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> in Southeast Asia without having to ask for an official declaration of war. The number of American military personnel in Vietnam increased dramatically, from 16,000 advisors in non-combat roles in 1963 to 525,000 in 1967, many in combat roles. American casualties soared and the peace process bogged down. Growing unease with the war stimulated a large, angry antiwar movement based especially on university campuses.|$|E
25|$|By 1985, when Aspin became {{chairman}} of the Armed Services Committee, he was recognized as a leading defense authority. His chairmanship caused controversy among some House Democrats, particularly because he supported the Reagan administration's policies on the MX missile and aid to the Nicaraguan Contras. Although temporarily removed from his committee chair by his Democratic colleagues in January 1987, Aspin weathered the crisis and regained the chairmanship three weeks later. He again broke with many Democrats in January 1991 when he issued a paper supporting the Bush administration's intention to <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> to drive the Iraqis from Kuwait. The accuracy of his prediction that the United States could win a quick military victory with light casualties added to {{his reputation as a}} military expert.|$|E

25|$|Some foreign {{observers}} thought traditionalism was {{no longer}} a strong force in Saudi Arabia. This idea was disproved when at least 500 dissidents invaded and seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca on 20 November 1979. When the first news of the attack in Mecca reached Riyadh, the initial reaction of King Khalid was to consult the ulama, in order to get permission to <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> to eject the attackers. The ulama hesitated and refrained from a definite answer. Only after the assault had been underway for 36 hours did some ulama allow the use of force. At the time of the event, Crown Prince Fahd was in Tunisia for a meeting of the Arab Summit and then commander of National Guard Prince Abdullah was in Morocco for an official visit. Therefore, King Khalid assigned the responsibility to Prince Sultan, then minister of defense and Prince Nayef, then minister of interior, to deal with the incident.|$|E
25|$|The VOC traded {{throughout}} Asia. Ships {{coming into}} Batavia from the Netherlands carried supplies for VOC settlements in Asia. Silver and copper from Japan {{were used to}} trade with India and China for silk, cotton, porcelain, and textiles. These products were either traded within Asia for the coveted spices or brought back to Europe. The VOC was also instrumental in introducing European ideas and technology to Asia. The Company supported Christian missionaries and traded modern technology with China and Japan. A more peaceful VOC trade post on Dejima, an artificial {{island off the coast}} of Nagasaki, was for more than two hundred years the only place where Europeans were permitted to trade with Japan. When the VOC tried to <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> to make Ming dynasty China open up to Dutch trade, the Chinese defeated the Dutch in a war over the Penghu islands from 1623–24, forcing the VOC to abandon Penghu for Taiwan. The Chinese defeated the VOC again at the Battle of Liaoluo Bay in 1633.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Sino-Japanese {{relations}} {{continued to}} deteriorate and Matsui too was gradually souring toward the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek, the same government he had strongly promoted back when serving as Chief of the Intelligence Division. In {{the first issue}} of the Greater Asia Association's official bulletin, put out in 1933, Matsui denounced China's leaders for having [...] "sold out their own country of China and betrayed Asia" [...] due to their allegedly pro-Western attitudes.
