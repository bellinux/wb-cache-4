40|$|Results of {{experimental}} investigation on the compressive strength of twenty solid round steel leg member specimens of lattice communication towers reinforced {{with one or}} two split pipe(s) are presented in this paper. The reinforcement was connected to the leg members either by means of <b>U-bolts</b> only or by means of <b>U-bolts</b> and end welding. It was found that bolt torque has no significant effect in the increase on the strength. It was also concluded that using two split pipes without end welding is better than using one split pipe with end welding.

40|$|This paper {{involves}} experimental investigation {{onto the}} composite behaviour of a hybrid FRP bridge girder with an overlying concrete deck. Two types of shear connections were investigated: epoxy resin adhesives alone and epoxy resin combined with steel <b>u-bolts.</b> The {{results showed that}} the steel <b>u-bolts</b> combined with epoxy resin provided a more effective connection; hence a full-size specimen was prepared based on this result. Four-point bending test was carried out to determine the behaviour of a full-scale composite hybrid FRP girder and concrete deck. The composite action resulted to a higher stiffness and strength with the hybrid FRP girder exhibiting higher tensile strain before final failure. There was a significant decrease in the compressive strain in the top flange of the FRP girder thereby preventing the sudden failure of the beam. The composite beam failed due to crushing of the concrete followed by shear failure in the top flange and web of the FRP girder. ...|$|R
40|$|In this work, a {{low alloy}} steel and a {{fabrication}} process were developed to produce <b>U-Bolts</b> for commercial vehicles. Thus, initially five types of no-heat treated steel were developed with different additions of chrome, nickel, and silicon to produce strain hardening effect during cold-forming processing of the <b>U-Bolts,</b> assuring the required mechanical properties. The new materials exhibited a fine perlite and ferrite microstructure due to aluminum and vanadium additions, well known as grain size refiners. The mechanical properties were evaluated in a servo-hydraulic test machine system-MTS 810 according to ASTM A 370 - 03; E 739 and E 08 m- 00 standards. The microstructure and fractography analyses of the cold-formed steels were performed by using optical and scanning electronic microscope techniques. To evaluate {{the performance of the}} steels and the production process, fatigue tests were carried out under load control (tensile-tensile), R = 0. 1 and f = 30 Hz. The Weibull statistic methodology was used for the analysis of the fatigue results. At the end of this work the 0. 21 % chrome content steel, Alloy 2, presented the best fatigue performance...|$|R

50|$|An early {{application}} of a torsion bar in an American car was by Hudson Motor Car Company of Detroit who had introduced the innovative front axle flex suspension in 1934 Hudson and Terraplane cars and realized for 1935 that a transverse torsion bar linked to the rear axle was needed as an anti-roll bar to stabilize the cars. The single torsion bar was mounted through the frame sides behind the rear axle and then attached by arms and links to the front side of the spring <b>U-bolt</b> plates. Axle flex was discontinued for the 1936 model year.|$|E

40|$|Name of the {{bachelor}} essay: Ropes course - project {{and execution of}} the project. The goal of this bachelor essay {{is to create a}} complete step-by-step document of a rope center realization in the Recreational and sport center U Starého Rybníka in Zbraslavice by Zruč nad Sázavou. The reader will be briefly introduced to the history and development of the rope centers and the following environmental education. Further it offers the description and the extended current processes and means necessary to build a rope way, which we later on implicate into the practice in a real rope center with 7 rope obstacles. The methods used in the period of creation of this bachelor essay were firstly collection of the data from Czech as well as international literature and experiences of the professionals in fields that directly concern rope activities. Gathered data were used for the proposal of a rope center project, which was approved and later on indeed realized. The result of our work is the collection of experiences and knowledge, which offers to the reader a complete view of the rope center building process from the very first project until the first step on the rope obstacle.

40|$|AbstractOverhead {{electric}} transport lines, {{cables and}} support systems, experiment complex stress and environment requirements due to ice formation and release, wind exposure, temperature fluctuations and corrosion. The burst of any {{element in the}} chain brings the cables to the floor, cutting the transport of the current with important liabilities. This work reports the rupture of a galvanized <b>U-bolt</b> steel stirrup of a 60 kV overhead electric transport line of a Eolic Park in the North of Portugal. This component is subject to a complex load system and variable attack angles. Thus, the component is subjected to fatigue, wear, static crush and corrosion. The fractured stirrup was manufactured from a hot rolled C 1 - S 235 JRC steel rod with Ø 14. 5 mm. The final component was hot dip galvanised and centrifuged according standard ISO 1461. Fracture surface and multiple cross section microscopy and chemical analysis of the fractured stirrup {{as well as of}} new unused stirrups was carried out to identify the rupture mechanisms responsible for the collapse of the structure. Residual resistance of the broken stirrup was evaluated via dedicated designed tensile testing. The original steel has a wide number of big inclusions, same over 400 m long, developed parallel to the axis of the rod. These inclusions intercept the surface of the rod, inducing surface indentations and cracking of the galvanised coating. Also a considerable number of pronounced notches are observed at the steel surface, at the steel/zinc coating interface. The fracture surface displays two symmetrical glossy burnish areas, characteristic of the fatigue processes, separated by a central ductile central zone. In the fractured component several cracks due to inclusions are observed intercepting the fracture surface. Zinc and Oxygen were identified of all over the fatigue grown crack surface indicating that hydrolysis of the coating took place with continuous wet transport to the cracked surface with precipitation and oxidation. The analysis carried out allows concluding that the failure of the component took place by fatigue. Fracture was initiated at the 1 st/ 2 nd thread of the component, close to the screw joint. The variable load acted perpendicularly to the plane of symmetry of the component. Corrosion took place simultaneously with fatigue crack propagation speeding the failure process. The inclusions present in the steel, mainly those that intercept the component surface, as well as the surface notches due to hot rolling, enhanced the disclosure of the fatigue process leading to premature failure of the component...|$|E
50|$|This new {{powerplant}} featured five {{main bearings}} {{with an unusual}} ball bearing system. This allowed the engine to rev to 6,000 rpm, and 90 hp (67 kW) was reliably produced. Solid axles with leaf springs were used front and rear, and drum brakes at the back, operated by cables, were specified. Alloy wheels were a novelty, as was the hollow front axle for reduced unsprung weight. A second feature of the Type 35 that {{was to become a}} Bugatti trademark was passing the springs through the front axle rather than simply <b>U-bolting</b> them together as was done on their earlier cars.|$|R
50|$|Fairlie {{brought a}} number of other {{innovative}} and highly effective features to the design. For instance, the forestay is bolted right through the hull and secured with a bolt hidden at the centre of a bronze casting of a thistle which becomes a feature of the bow. The shrouds and backstay are secured to <b>u-bolts</b> through the deck, eliminating the need for rigging screws. The <b>u-bolts</b> provide a compression packing that can be screwed down tight, and owners report that they seldom leak. The deck is moulded with a lip that turns up to fit inside the hull moulding, and after being glued and glassed in, the join is covered with a custom-designed vinyl moulding that eliminates the common problem of deck/hull leaks, and also serves as a practical rubbing strake. The mast is deck-stepped on an aluminium channel that sits above the two main internal bulkheads - a solution that allows easy passage below decks to the forecabin, while ensuring a solid base for the mast. Many of the boats were delivered with an outboard engine that was mounted in a cutout in the rear cockpit bench seat and could be removed and stowed below the cockpit - a configuration that was later adopted in other production yachts. These models were also delivered with an arch in the companionway cutout instead of a sliding hatchway, thus simplifying construction, retaining bulkhead strength and removing another possible source of leaks.|$|R

50|$|Some {{methods of}} lifting {{are good for}} the rear, {{but not for the}} front, such as lifting blocks. Lifting the rear with blocks is a common way to achieve the desired height. This is done by {{installing}} a block, of the desired height of lift, in between the leaf spring and leaf spring perch and installing longer <b>U-bolts.</b> It is a bad method for the front primarily because of safety issues while braking. When braking, the front wheels create the majority of the braking force. The block moves this lateral force, caused by braking, higher above the axle than it did in the stock form. This can cause the block to become displaced from its location and result in total loss of control.

25|$|The hull is of {{conventional}} glassfibre construction, {{with a strong}} layup conforming to Lloyd's standards. The two tonnes of lead ballast is encapsulated in the hull, obviating the need for keel bolts. The hull is joined to the deck by a large bulwark, topped with a teak caprail. Unusually, the deck has no balsa core, instead using solid glassfibre construction. Although this makes for greater longevity of the hull {{as there is no}} core to rot or delaminate, a slight 'flex' can sometimes be felt. The mast is keel stepped, and is supported by double lower shrouds for greater redundancy. The standing rigging terminates at <b>U-bolts</b> in the deck. Although this type of chainplate is sometimes criticised, there is no recorded instance of a dismasting, and Rogers claims reinforcing this system would have no impact on safety. It has the benefit of simplicity and low cost.|$|R
50|$|Multi-leaf springs {{are widely}} used for the {{suspension}} of cars, trucks and railway wagons. A multi-leaf spring consists {{of a series of}} flat plates, usually of semi-elliptical shape. The flat plates are called leaves of the spring.The leaf at the top has maximum length. The length gradually decreases from the top leaf to the bottom leaf. The longest leaf at the top is called master leaf. It is bent at both ends to form the spring eyes. Two bolts are inserted through these eyes to fix the leaf spring to the automobile body. The leaves are held together by means of two <b>U-bolts</b> and a center clip. Rebound clips are provided to keep the leaves in alignment and prevent lateral shifting of the leaves during operation. At the center, the leaf spring is supported on the axle. Multi-leaf springs are provided with one or two extra full-length leaves in addition to the master leaf and the graduated length leaves. The extra full-length leaves are provided to support the transverse sheer force.|$|R

40|$|The {{behavior}} of hybrid Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) I-girder with compositely acting concrete deck {{is discussed in}} this paper. The innovative feature of this hybrid composite girder optimizes the combined use of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) and {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} (GFRP) in flanges to maximize structural performance while reducing the overall cost by using only GFRP in the web section. Preliminary investigations revealed that the hybrid FRP girder failed due to local buckling, separation of laminates and crushing near the loading point in the compression flange with the compressive and tensile strain smaller than the expected maximum strains. In view of improving its structural performance, concrete deck was provided on top of hybrid FRP composite girder to give stability on the thin compression flange because of its high compressive strength. Two types of shear connections were trialed to provide composite action between the hybrid FRP girder and concrete deck. Results of the experiment showed that a good composite action was achieved between hybrid FRP girder and concrete deck using steel <b>u-bolts</b> combined with epoxy for shear connection. The composite action leads to a higher tensile strain in the hybrid FRP girder and resulted to efficient utilization of the FRP materials. The results of the Fibre Model Analysis using the effective mechanical properties of the hybrid FRP showed a good agreement with the experimental data...|$|R
