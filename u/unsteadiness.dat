5|$|Adverse {{effects from}} {{medications}} {{are reported in}} 10 to 90% of people, depending on how and from whom the data is collected. Most adverse effects are dose-related and mild. Some examples include mood changes, sleepiness, or an <b>unsteadiness</b> in gait. Certain medications have side effects that {{are not related to}} dose such as rashes, liver toxicity, or suppression of the bone marrow. Up to a quarter of people stop treatment due to adverse effects. Some medications are associated with birth defects when used in pregnancy. Many of the common used medications, such as valproate, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbitol, and gabapentin have been reported to cause increased risk of birth defects, especially when used during the first trimester. Despite this, treatment is often continued once effective, because the risk of untreated epilepsy is believed to be greater than the risk of the medications. Among the antiepileptic medications, levetiracetam and lamotrigine seem to carry the lowest risk of causing birth defects.|$|E
5|$|Obstruction {{of blood}} {{flow through the}} {{affected}} vessel may lead to dysfunction of {{part of the brain}} supplied by the artery. This happens in 77–96% of cases. This may be temporary ("transient ischemic attack") in 10–16% of cases, but many (67–85% of cases) end up with a permanent deficit or a stroke. The vertebral artery supplies {{the part of the brain}} that lies in the posterior fossa of the skull, and this type of stroke is therefore called a posterior circulation infarct. Problems may include difficulty speaking or swallowing (lateral medullary syndrome); this occurs in less than a fifth of cases and occurs due to dysfunction of the brainstem. Others may experience <b>unsteadiness</b> or lack of coordination due to involvement of the cerebellum, and still others may develop visual loss (on one side of the visual field) due to involvement of the visual cortex in the occipital lobe. In the event of involvement of the sympathetic tracts in the brainstem, a partial Horner's syndrome may develop; this is the combination of a drooping eyelid, constricted pupil, and an apparently sunken eye on one side of the face.|$|E
25|$|Adult/Late-Onset Tay–Sachs disease. A rare {{form of this}} disease, {{known as}} Adult-Onset or Late-Onset Tay–Sachs disease, usually has its first {{symptoms}} during the 30s or 40s. In contrast to the other forms, late-onset Tay–Sachs disease is usually not fatal as the effects can stop progressing. It is frequently misdiagnosed. It is characterized by <b>unsteadiness</b> of gait and progressive neurological deterioration. Symptoms of late-onset Tay–Sachs which typically begin {{to be seen in}} adolescence or early adulthood– include speech and swallowing difficulties, <b>unsteadiness</b> of gait, spasticity, cognitive decline, and psychiatric illness, particularly a schizophrenia-like psychosis. People with late-onset Tay–Sachs may become full-time wheelchair users in adulthood.|$|E
25|$|Tea tree oil is {{poisonous}} {{when taken}} internally, possibly causing drowsiness, confusion, hallucinations, coma, <b>unsteadiness,</b> weakness, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach upset, blood cell abnormalities, and severe rashes. Tea tree oil {{should not be}} used in or around the mouth.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that about 30% of people with Meniere's disease have eustachian tube dysfunction. While a 2005 review found tentative evidence of benefit from tympanostomy tubes for improvement in the <b>unsteadiness</b> associated with the disease. A 2014 review concluded that they are not supported.|$|E
25|$|Sensory {{symptoms}} are gradually followed by motor symptoms. Motor symptoms may include muscle cramps and weakness, erectile dysfunction in men, problems urinating, constipation, and diarrhea. Individuals also may experience muscle wasting and decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes. Some people may experience frequent falls and gait <b>unsteadiness</b> due to ataxia. This ataxia {{may be caused}} by cerebellar degeneration, sensory ataxia, or distal muscle weakness. Over time, alcoholic polyneuropathy may also cause difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), speech impairment (disarthria), muscle spasms, and muscle atrophy.|$|E
25|$|Many new assistive devices made {{especially}} for the home have enabled more old people to care for themselves {{activities of daily living}} (ADL). Able Data lists 40,000 assistive technology products in 20 categories. Some examples of devices are a medical alert and safety system, shower seat (making it so the person does not get tired in the shower and fall), a bed cane (offering support to those with <b>unsteadiness</b> getting in and out of bed) and an ADL cuff (used with eating utensils for people with paralysis or hand weakness).|$|E
25|$|Minocycline {{may cause}} upset stomach, diarrhea, dizziness, <b>unsteadiness,</b> drowsiness, mouth sores, {{headache}} and vomiting. Minocycline increases sensitivity to sunlight. Minocycline {{may affect the}} quality of sleep and rarely cause sleep disorders. It has also been linked to cases of lupus. Prolonged use of minocycline {{over an extended period of}} time can lead to blue-gray skin, fingernails and staining of scar tissue. This staining is not permanent but can take a very long time for the skin color to return to normal; on the other hand a muddy brown skin color in sun exposed areas is usually a permanent skin discolouration. Permanent blue discoloration of gums or teeth discoloration may also occur. Rare but serious side effects include fever, yellowing of the eyes or skin, stomach pain, sore throat, vision changes, and mental changes, including depersonalization.|$|E
25|$|On 21 May, {{the first}} day of the Battle of Aspern-Essling, the {{grenadier}} reserve was not committed to combat. The next day, Napoleon tried to break out of the narrow bridgehead by sending Marshal Jean Lannes with three divisions to assault the weak Austrian center. In the crisis, Archduke Charles moved d'Aspré's and Prochaska's grenadier divisions (under Kienmayer) to block Lannes. When the troops showed <b>unsteadiness,</b> Charles personally waved the colors of the grenadiers of the Zach Infantry Regiment Nr. 15 to rally his troops. This greatly heartened the defenders, and the French assault was defeated when reinforcements arrived from the right and left flanks. In the afternoon, Charles ordered Merville's brigade from d'Aspré's division to attack Essling, which had held out against repeated assaults. The grenadiers routed the French from the village, except for the fortress-like granary which held out. Later, five battalions of the Imperial Guard recaptured Essling.|$|E
25|$|Timbre is {{perceived}} as the quality of different sounds (e.g. the thud of a fallen rock, the whir of a drill, the tone of a musical instrument or {{the quality of a}} voice) and represents the pre-conscious allocation of a sonic identity to a sound (e.g. “it’s an oboe!"). This identity is based on information gained from frequency transients, noisiness, <b>unsteadiness,</b> perceived pitch and the spread and intensity of overtones in the sound over an extended time frame. The way a sound changes over time (see figure 4) provides most of the information for timbre identification. Even though a small section of the wave form from each instrument looks very similar (see the expanded sections indicated by the orange arrows in figure 4), differences in changes over time between the clarinet and the piano are evident in both loudness and harmonic content. Less noticeable are the different noises heard, such as air hisses for the clarinet and hammer strikes for the piano.|$|E

500|$|Rob Bowman used {{a couple}} of {{specific}} camera techniques for the scenes on board the Stargazer during Picard's hallucinations. A steadicam attached to a cameraman was used to show a slight <b>unsteadiness,</b> {{and each of the}} Stargazer crew members were filmed individually on the bridge against a smoke background before being superimposed together. He explained, [...] "we went dark in a lot of scenes and we did different angles and things the show hadn't done yet. For me, it was a real creative stretch and it felt great for the show." [...] The bridge itself was a re-dress of the film-era Klingon Bird of Prey bridge. The term [...] "Picard Maneuver" [...] was later used offscreen to refer informally to Patrick Stewart's habit of tugging his uniform shirt down, and the Battle of Maxia itself was described in the first chapter of the pre-TNG era novel The Buried Age.|$|E
500|$|Sir Edward Reed, the Director of Naval Construction, was tasked {{to provide}} a {{combination}} of seaworthiness and speed for these ships. He gave the ships a high length-to-beam ratio to increase their speed, but this made the design less manoeuvrable. To offset this, {{the ends of the}} ships were narrowed to allow the rudder as much authority as possible even though this reduced buoyancy at the ends of the ship and caused the weights to be concentrated {{in the middle of the}} ship. The compromise proved to be successful and the design did not have a large turning circle. Admiral G. A. Ballard considered them to be [...] "a definite step forward in the shipbuilder's art." [...] Ballard considered their only real defect to be <b>unsteadiness</b> as gun platforms as their metacentric height was fairly high, which caused them to roll excessively, and they pitched quite a bit in a head sea due to the lack of buoyancy in the narrow bow. Bilge keels were later installed during one of their refits to curb their rolling motion.|$|E
2500|$|Vertigo is a {{sensation}} of spinning while stationary. [...] It is {{commonly associated with}} nausea or vomiting, <b>unsteadiness</b> (postural instability), falls, changes to a person's thoughts, and difficulties in walking. [...] Recurrent episodes in those with vertigo are common and frequently impair the quality of life. Blurred vision, difficulty in speaking, a lowered level of consciousness, and hearing loss may also occur. The {{signs and symptoms of}} vertigo can present as a persistent (insidious) onset or an episodic (sudden) onset.|$|E
2500|$|Louise Caselotti, {{who worked}} with Callas in 1946 and 1947, prior to her Italian debut, {{felt that it was}} not the heavy roles that hurt Callas's voice, but the lighter ones. Several singers have {{suggested}} that Callas's heavy use of the chest voice led to stridency and <b>unsteadiness</b> with the high notes. In his book, Callas's husband Meneghini wrote that Callas suffered an unusually early onset of menopause, which could have affected her voice. Soprano Carol Neblett once said, [...] "A woman sings with her ovaries—you're only as good as your hormones." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{factor is}} {{the manner in which}} the spouse died. [...] The {{survivor}} of a spouse who died of an illness has a different experience of such loss than a survivor of a spouse who died by an act of violence. [...] The grief, in all events, however, can always be of the most profound sort to the widow and the widower. [...] Emotional <b>unsteadiness,</b> bouts of crying, helplessness and hopelessness are just a small sample of what a widow or widower can expect to face. [...] Depression and loneliness are very common. [...] Feeling bitter and resentful are normal feelings for the spouse who is [...] "left behind". [...] Oftentimes, the widow/widower may feel it necessary to seek professional help in dealing with their new life.|$|E
2500|$|Cola di Rienzo's {{character}} {{has been described}} as a combination of knowledge, eloquence, and enthusiasm for ideal excellence, with vanity, inexperience of mankind, <b>unsteadiness,</b> and physical timidity. As these latter qualities became conspicuous, they eclipsed his virtues, and caused his benefits to be forgotten. [...] His extravagant pretensions only served to excite ridicule. His government was costly, and to meet its many expenses he was obliged to lay heavy taxes upon the people. He offended the pope by his arrogance and pride, and both pope and emperor by his proposal to set up a new Roman Empire, the sovereignty of which would rest directly upon the will of the people. In October Clement gave power to a legate to depose him and bring him to trial, and the end was obviously in sight.|$|E
2500|$|Under the {{influence}} of androgens, the voice box, or larynx, grows in both sexes. This growth is far more prominent in boys, causing the male voice to drop and deepen, sometimes abruptly but rarely [...] "overnight," [...] about one octave, because the longer and thicker vocal folds have a lower fundamental frequency. Before puberty, the larynx {{of boys and girls}} is about equally small. Occasionally, voice change is accompanied by <b>unsteadiness</b> of vocalization {{in the early stages of}} untrained voices. Most of the voice change happens during stage 3-4 of male puberty around the time of peak growth. Adult pitch is attained at an average age of 15 years, although the voice may not fully settle until early twenties. It usually precedes the development of significant facial hair by several months to years.|$|E
2500|$|There were others, however, {{who felt}} that the voice had benefitted from the weight loss. Of her {{performance}} of Norma in Chicago in 1954, Claudia Cassidy wrote that [...] "there is a slight <b>unsteadiness</b> {{in some of the}} sustained upper notes, but to me her voice is more beautiful in color, more even through the range, than it used to be". And at her performance of the same opera in London in 1957 (her first performance at Covent Garden after the weight loss), critics again felt her voice had changed for the better, that it had now supposedly become a more precise instrument, with a new focus. Many of her most critically acclaimed appearances are from the period 1954–1958 (Norma, La traviata, Sonnambula and Lucia of 1955, Anna Bolena of 1957, Medea of 1958, to name a few).|$|E
2500|$|Bromazepam {{is similar}} in side effects to other benzodiazepines. The most common side effects {{reported}} are drowsiness, sedation, ataxia, memory impairment, and dizziness. Impairments to memory functions are common with bromazepam and include a reduced working memory and reduced ability to process environmental information. [...] A 1975 experiment on healthy, male college students exploring the effects of four different drugs on learning capacity observed that taking bromazepam alone at 6mg 3 times daily for 2 weeks impaired learning capacities significantly. In combination with alcohol, impairments in learning capacity became even more pronounced. Various studies report impaired memory, visual information processing and sensory data and impaired psychomotor performance; deterioration of cognition including attention capacity and impaired co-ordinative skills; impaired reactive and attention performance, which can impair driving skills; drowsiness and decrease in libido. <b>Unsteadiness</b> after taking bromazepam is, however, less pronounced than other benzodiazepines such as lorazepam.|$|E
2500|$|Commercial and bootleg {{recordings}} of Callas {{from the late}} 1940s to 1953—the period during which she sang the heaviest dramatic soprano roles—show no decline {{in the fabric of}} the voice, no loss in volume and no <b>unsteadiness</b> or shrinkage in the upper register. Of her December 1952 Lady Macbeth—coming after five years of singing the most strenuous dramatic soprano repertoire—Peter Dragadze wrote for Opera, [...] "Callas's voice since last season has improved a great deal, the second passagio on the high B-natural and C has now completely cleared, giving her an equally colored scale from top to bottom." [...] And of her performance of Medea a year later, John Ardoin writes, [...] "The performance displays Callas in as secure and free a voice as she will be found at any point in her career. The many top B's have a brilliant ring, and she handles the treacherous tessitura like an eager thoroughbred." ...|$|E
2500|$|With his {{artillery}} {{posted at}} the Champaubert crossroads, Poltoratsky's brigade drove off several cavalry charges. In fierce {{fighting with the}} bayonet, Ricard's soldiers captured the village, lost it to a counterattack, then clawed their way back into a few houses. After failing to cut his {{way out to the}} east, about 3:00 pm Poltoratsky began a fighting withdrawal to the north with his men in square formation. Heading for the village of La Caure, his soldiers kept the French back with regular volleys. About [...] north of Champaubert they began to run out of ammunition and their ranks began to show <b>unsteadiness.</b> The French demanded that Poltoratsky capitulate and when he refused, they brought up a horse artillery battery and began blasting his troops with canister shot. Instead of being a possible refuge, the nearby woods turned out to be filled with French skirmishers. With his men being mown down by canister and riddled by musketry, Poltoratsky finally agreed to surrender his two regiments and cannons.|$|E
2500|$|The insincerity of Crawford's {{feelings}} towards Price {{is demonstrated}} when he runs off with newly married Mrs. Maria Rushworth (née Bertram), which exposes his callous, amoral nature and also conveniently destroys Edmund Bertram's relationship with Mary Crawford, {{making it possible}} for Price and Bertram to marry. Furthermore, the fact the scandal is reported in the newspapers further adds to the misery of the Bertrams and the fact that Henry takes Maria away from the community, thereby depriving the Betrams of a family member shows his selfish, egoistical character. The Canadian scholar Eleanor Ty wrote Austen, like Charlotte Turner Smith before her used [...] "...disgraceful affairs to show the inconstancy and <b>unsteadiness</b> of the suitors. The rash, unthinking act of going off with a married woman becomes the irrevocable step that divides these incompatible suitors from the heroines". Ty suggested that Austen was inspired in her means of exposing Henry Crawford as not a gentleman by Smith's 1788 novel Emmeline, arguing there was a literary tradition of women writers borrowing from each other's work, and that Austen was not as hostile towards Smith as often portrayed.|$|E
2500|$|Babo reminds Cereno that it’s {{time for}} his shave. [...] "Most negroes are natural valets and hairdressers; taking to the comb and brush congenially as to the castinets, and flourishing them {{apparently}} with equal satisfaction", springing from [...] "the docility arising from the unaspiring contentment of a limited mind". Babo suggests that Delano joins them in the cuddy to continue the conversation with Cereno, and Delano witnesses the shaving with an appreciative eye for Babo’s graceful skill as a barber and a hairdresser. Babo first searches [...] "for the sharpest" [...] razor, and Cereno [...] "nervously shuddered" [...] at the [...] "sight of gleaming steel". Delano himself, for a brief moment, cannot resist [...] "the vagary, that in the black he saw a headsman, and in the white, {{a man at the}} block." [...] Cereno is nervously shaking, and just when Delano curiously asks him how he could have spent over two months crossing a distance Delano himself would have sailed within a few days, then, whether caused by a sudden wave on the sea, or [...] "a momentary <b>unsteadiness</b> of the servant’s hand; however it was, just then the razor drew blood", and immediately [...] "the black barber drew back his steel". Delano precedes the two out of the cuddy and walks to the mainmast, where Babo joins him, complaining that Cereno cut his cheek in reproach for his carelessness, while Cereno’s own shaking caused the cut. Delano feels that slavery fosters ugly passions, and invites Cereno for coffee aboard the Bachelor’s Delight, which Cereno declines, offending Delano, who is also increasingly irritated by the lack of opportunity to have a private conversation without Babo within hearing distance.|$|E

60|$|Just then Peegwish the Indian entered. He walked {{towards the}} sisters with that solemn dignity of manner {{peculiar}} to the North American savage, but the intensified solemnity of his looks {{and a certain}} <b>unsteadiness</b> in his gait rather marred the dignity.|$|E

60|$|After looking {{me in the}} eye {{for some}} time, and, by so doing, {{revealing}} an obvious <b>unsteadiness</b> in his own visual organs, he begged me to reach forth my arm. I did so; wondering what upon earth that useful member {{had to do with the}} matter in hand.|$|E
60|$|In {{the quick}} <b>unsteadiness</b> of the surprise, he staggered, and slipped {{on to the}} road below him. But {{recovering}} his feet immediately, he stepped back a pace or two upon that road, to interpose some wider space between them, {{and looked at his}} pursuer, breathing short and quick.|$|E
60|$|Mordaunt {{rose with}} cold dignity. If {{he had been}} a dupe, he was one no longer, as could be plainly read on his calm, pale face. The old listlessness, the <b>unsteadiness</b> had vanished. He wore a manner of extreme quietude; but his eyes were like balls of blazing blue steel.|$|E
60|$|The slight <b>unsteadiness</b> of {{his tone}} at first surprised, then brought her {{almost to the}} point of confusion. Their eyes met--a startled glance on her part, merely to assure herself that he was in earnest--and {{afterwards}} there was a moment's embarrassment. She accepted a cigarette and went back to her easy-chair.|$|E
60|$|The woman's calmness {{presented}} {{a strange and}} touching contrast to the man's emotion. There was no shrinking in her face, there was no <b>unsteadiness</b> in her voice as she answered him. He took her hand. Twice he attempted to speak; and twice his own agitation overpowered him. He offered the letter to her in silence.|$|E
60|$|She entered on her {{business}} with us, wasting {{no time in}} preliminary words. Her face showed plain signs, poor soul, of a wakeful and tearful night. But she claimed no indulgence on that account. When she spoke of her dead husband--excepting a slight <b>unsteadiness</b> in her voice--she controlled herself with a courage which was at once pitiable and admirable to see.|$|E
6000|$|The {{thoughts}} come in as {{a witness}} for God against the sinner upon the account of that <b>unsteadiness</b> and variety that were in them, both touching God, and their own selves. Sometimes the man thinks there is no God, but that everything hath its rise of itself, or by chance, or fortune--"The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God" [...] (Psa 14:1).|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not going}} to touch you--you needn't be afraid," [...] he said. Reassured by the <b>unsteadiness</b> of his voice she raised her eyes to {{perceive}} that his face was ashy, his manner nervous, apprehensive, conciliatory,--a Ditmar she had difficulty in recognizing. [...] "I didn't mean to frighten, to offend you," [...] he went on. [...] "Something got hold of me. I was crazy, I couldn't help it--I won't do it again, if you'll stay. I give you my word." ...|$|E
