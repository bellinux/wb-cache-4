40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to use laboratory experiments to test the dynamic theory of free riding among the target shareholders during a takeover attempt. We construct our experiments to reflect the dynamics of <b>unconditional</b> <b>bidding</b> suggested by Harrington and Prokop (1993) and the dynamics of conditional bidding analyzed by Prokop (2003). The experimental results show that the observed tendering probabilities are higher than the theoretically predicted values in the case of <b>unconditional</b> <b>bidding.</b> Thus the actual behavior of shareholders is characterized by much less free riding than predicted by the theory of unconditional tender offers. In the case of conditional offers, the theoretical predictions for the tendering probabilities are confirmed by the laboratory behavior of shareholders in the case of multiple bidding. As suggested by the theory, the tendering probabilities are lower under multiple conditional <b>bids</b> than under <b>unconditional</b> offers...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{several issues}} related to pricing in construction. First, problems with current pricing strategy in construction are explored. Second, pricing strategies based on a market-based approach are proposed. Third, survey findings of the top 400 US contractors are presented regarding their current pricing practices and {{the applicability of the}} proposed pricing strategies. In conclusion, the belief that current pricing strategy in construction is predominantly cost-based is confirmed by the survey findings; indeed, in setting the markup, most contractors rely on their intuition after subjectively assessing the competition. The three internal pricing variables that have the largest statistically significant contingency coefficients with pricing strategy are 'marketing intelligence capabilities', 'annual contract value', and 'the type of client in most projects'. 'Owner's characteristics', 'competitors'characteristics', and 'market demand' are statistically significant external variables in making pricing strategy decisions. A change of <b>bidding</b> <b>procedure</b> is proposed so that all parties in construction can maximize the benefits of market-based pricing strategies.
