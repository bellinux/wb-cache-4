5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the game, the Hokies struggled on offense and were held scoreless <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> second quarter. Kansas, however, was able to get on the board several times, jumping to a 17–0 lead before Virginia Tech scored its first points. Kansas's broke the game open in the first quarter after All-American cornerback Aqib Talib intercepted a pass by backup Virginia Tech quarterback Tyrod Taylor and returned the ball 60yards for the game's opening points.|$|E
60|$|There {{was little}} more snow that winter, but the weather {{remained}} bitterly cold <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> February. <b>The</b> boys had considerable fun snowballing, and skating on the river.

50|$|Designed for {{and largely}} {{operated}} in London, over 2,800 AEC Routemasters were built between 1956 and 1968, with a design so robust that the Routemaster outlasted newer buses intended to replace it, remaining in use <b>until</b> 2005, <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> deregulated era.|$|R

5|$|Rebuilding and {{refurbishing}} {{the palace}} took <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 1950s, with full restoration not completed until the 1990s. In 1989 a large trompe-l'œil fresco depicting the Roman goddess Ceres was rediscovered behind layers of plaster and white {{paint in the}} former dining hall, the eastern wing of the Synod Hall (see below, Apartments). It {{is thought to have}} been concealed under Napoleonic ownership, and had been forgotten since.|$|E
5|$|While certain beliefs {{regarding}} {{the effectiveness of}} tobacco smoke to protect against disease persisted <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 20th century, the use of smoke enemas in Western medicine declined after 1811, when through animal experimentation Benjamin Brodie demonstrated that nicotine—the principal active agent in tobacco smoke—is a cardiac poison that can stop the circulation of blood.|$|E
5|$|Woo is {{cast as a}} villain, {{underscored by}} her {{frequent}} appearance to the theme music that accompanied the Wicked Witch of the West in the Wizard of Oz. Unlike a melodramatic villain such as J. R.

5|$|Anna and Michael Ancher, Krøyer and Tuxen {{continued}} to paint in Skagen <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 20th century and were occasionally joined by their earlier friends. Two core {{members of the}} group, Drachmann and Krøyer, died in 1908 and 1909, bringing the traditional gatherings of the group to an end. There were nevertheless other painters, {{sometimes referred to as}} the younger group of Skagen painters, who {{continued to}} visit the area. They included Jørgen Aabye, Tupsy and Gad Frederik Clement, Ella Heide, Ludvig Karsten, Frederik Lange and Johannes Wilhjelm, some of whom settled in the area until the 1930s or even later. Skagens Museum has a number of their works in its collection.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 16th century, the {{establishment}} of a harbour at the East Burn confirmed the town's early role as an important trading port. The town also began to develop around the salt, coal mining and nail making industries. The production of linen which followed in 1672 was later instrumental in the introduction of floorcloth in 1847 by linen manufacturer, Michael Nairn. In 1877 this in turn contributed to linoleum, which became the town's most successful industry: Kirkcaldy was a world producer <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mid-1960s. The town expanded considerably in the 1950s and 1960s, though the decline of the linoleum industry and other manufacturing restricted its growth thereafter.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} period, the Sicilian Muslims also {{established}} footholds in the Italian mainland. The Muslims {{were asked to}} assist the beleaguered Duchy of Naples against Sicard of Benevento in 839, but then they sacked Brindisi and, following Sicard's murder and the outbreak of {{civil war in the}} Principality of Benevento, seized Tarentum in 840 and Bari in 847, which they made their bases. <b>Until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 880s, the Muslims would launch destructive raids along the coasts of Italy and into the Adriatic Sea from their bases on the Italian mainland — most notably from the Emirate of Bari, until its destruction in 871.|$|E

However, the piano introduction was played during the Hot Space and Works tours.|$|R
50|$|In {{keeping with}} his evangelical views, Aberhart added a {{heavy dose of}} social {{conservatism}} to Douglas' original ideas. Most notably, he enacted very tight restrictions on the sale of alcohol. Indeed, the only stricter law in Canada at the time was in Prince Edward Island, where the sale of alcohol remained completely banned <b>until</b> 1948. <b>Well</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 1960s, commercial airlines could not serve alcohol while flying over Alberta.|$|R
5|$|Qutayba's role in {{the conquest}} and gradual Islamization of Central Asia was crucial, and in later times, a number of {{locations}} in Ferghana where his tomb was supposedly located (Narshakhi and Jamal Qarsh) were venerated by pilgrims. His descendants too continued to hold influential positions: his son Qatan served as governor of Bukhara, Salm, another son, governed Basra and Rayy, and his nephew Muslim was governor of Balkh. His grandsons, especially the numerous sons of Salm, continued in high office under the Abbasids <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 9th century.|$|E
5|$|Soybean {{cultivation}}: The {{cultivation of}} soybeans {{began in the}} eastern half of northern China by 2000 BC, but is almost certainly much older. Liu et al. (1997) stated that soybean originated in China and was domesticated about 3500 BC. By the 5th century, soybeans were being cultivated in much of eastern Asia, but the crop did not move beyond this region <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 20th century. Written records of the cultivation and use of the soybean in China date back {{at least as far as}} the Western Zhou Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The college's {{undergraduate}} gossip sheet {{is entitled}} The Sheepshagger in allusion to an offensive joke about Welsh people's supposed penchant for sheep. Furthermore, the Welshness of the College is self-perpetuating, as Welsh students will often apply to Jesus {{because it is}} seen as the Welsh college. Old members recall the college having a majority of Welsh members <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 20th century; today, however, around 15% of undergraduates come from Wales. For comparison, residents of Wales comprise just under 5% of the United Kingdom population (2.9million {{out of a total of}} 58.8million at the time of the 2001 Census).|$|E
50|$|At the battle, on 21 October 1805, Thunderers {{position}} was towards {{the rear of}} Collingwood's division, and so she did not reach <b>the</b> action <b>until</b> <b>well</b> on <b>into</b> <b>the</b> day. Nonetheless, Stockham and Thunderer performed admirably, engaging the Spanish flagship Principe de Asturias and the French Neptune. Thunderer suffered 16 casualties but remained largely intact, which enabled her to aid more battered ships during the storm which followed.|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 16thcentury, the town became an important trading port. The town took advantage of its east coast location, which facilitated trading contacts with the Low Countries, the Baltic region, England, and Northern France. The feu-ferme charter of 1451 between the Abbot of Dunfermline and the burgesses of Kirkcaldy mentioned a small but functioning harbour; it is not known when this harbour was established, or whether it was always located {{at the mouth of the}} East Burn. According to treasurers' accounts of the early 16thcentury, timber imported via the harbour—possibly from the Baltic countries—was used at Falkland Palace and Edinburgh Castle, as well as in shipbuilding. Raw materials such as hides, wool, skins, herring, salmon, coal and salt were exported from the town <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 17thcentury.|$|E
5|$|Because of his height, Ulis was {{overlooked}} <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> recruiting {{process for}} top basketball schools. He was not highly recruited until his 201314 {{senior year of}} high school. Among schools regarded as high-major programs, only Iowa and DePaul made him offers during his junior year. His other offers were from Dayton, Colorado State, Loyola, Northern Illinois and Oregon State. During his junior season, his stock soared and Marian Catholic started winning. In the March 2013 Illinois High School Association Class 4A sectional round, Marian Catholic vied against Bloom High School and then played Edwardsville High School in the supersectional round. Although Marian lost to a much taller Edwardsville team, it established a school record for wins with a 294 record and it won its IHSA sectional for the first time. Ulis finished fourth in the Illinois Mr. Basketball balloting behind Jabari Parker, Jahlil Okafor and Malcolm Hill. He was a first team All-state selection by the Chicago Tribune along with Parker, Okafor, Cliff Alexander and Jalen Brunson.|$|E
5|$|Huntsman's {{process was}} only made {{obsolete}} in 1856 by Henry Bessemer's {{invention of the}} Bessemer converter, but production of crucible steel continued <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 20th century for special uses, as Bessemer's steel was not of the same quality, in the main replacing wrought iron for such applications as rails. Bessemer had tried to induce steelmakers to take up his improved system, but met with general rebuffs, and finally was driven to undertake the exploitation of the process himself. To this end he erected steelworks in Sheffield. Gradually the scale of production was enlarged until the competition became effective, and steel traders generally became aware that the firm of Henry Bessemer & Co. was underselling them {{to the extent of}} £20 a ton. One of Bessemer's converters can still be seen at Sheffield's Kelham Island Museum.|$|E
50|$|Bromley was {{not able}} to return to {{parliament}} <b>until</b> early March, <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> next session.

5|$|In 1890, {{the railway}} to Skagen not only {{led to the}} {{expansion}} of the village but also brought in considerable numbers of tourists. It was largely responsible for breaking up the regular summer meetings of the artists' colony as they could no longer find suitable accommodation and venues for their meetings. However, some of them purchased homes in Skagen: P.S. Krøyer in 1894, Laurits Tuxen in 1901, Holger Drachmann in 1903. Anna and Michael Ancher, Krøyer and Tuxen continued to paint in Skagen <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 20th century and were occasionally joined by their earlier friends.

5|$|The 1859 {{publication}} of Darwin's theory in On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life is often considered the central {{event in the}} history of modern biology. Darwin's established credibility as a naturalist, the sober tone of the work, and most of all the sheer strength and volume of evidence presented, allowed Origin to succeed where previous evolutionary works such as the anonymous Vestiges of Creation had failed. Most scientists were convinced of evolution and common descent {{by the end of the}} 19th century. However, natural selection would not be accepted as the primary mechanism of evolution <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 20th century, as most contemporary theories of heredity seemed incompatible with the inheritance of random variation.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine {{government}} sent a few {{expeditions to}} aid the locals against the Muslims, but preoccupied with the struggle against the Abbasids on their eastern frontier and with the Cretan Saracens in the Aegean Sea, it was unable to mount a sustained effort to drive back the Muslims, who {{over the next three}} decades raided Byzantine possessions almost unopposed. The strong fortress of Enna in the centre of the island was the main Byzantine bulwark against Muslim expansion, until its capture in 859. Following its fall, the Muslims increased their pressure against the eastern parts of the island, and after a long siege captured Syracuse in 878. The Byzantines retained control of some fortresses in the north-eastern corner of the island for some decades thereafter, and launched a number of efforts to recover the island <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 11th century, but were unable to seriously challenge Muslim control over Sicily. The fall of the last major Byzantine fortress, Taormina, in 902, is held to mark the completion of the Muslim conquest of Sicily.|$|E
