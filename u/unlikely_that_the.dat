5|$|Along with Charles Madigan, Keogh {{withdrew from}} playing Manchester on 11 March after tour manager James Scott refused to lend them money. It is <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> players, {{including}} Keogh, {{would have had}} much recourse over disputes with the tour organisers; they would struggle to access the funds to necessary for passage back to New Zealand without them.|$|E
5|$|Although many Anahim volcanoes are {{surrounded}} by Chilcotin Group basalt flows, {{the exact nature of}} their relationship is unknown. It is <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Anahim volcanoes ever were a source area for the Chilcotin basalts as they have distinct transitional geochemistries. The Chilcotin Group is interpreted to be related to back-arc extension behind the Cascadia subduction zone.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> saga writers had {{accurate}} information on {{details of the}} battle beyond the sparse accounts in the surviving poems. Nevertheless, starting with Oddr Snorrason, they present an elaborate literary account, depicting the main participants through their words and deeds.|$|E

25|$|A {{supernova}} will radiate {{except in}} <b>the</b> <b>unlikely</b> event <b>that</b> <b>the</b> explosion is perfectly symmetric.|$|R
50|$|It is <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> any of <b>the</b> episodes {{still exist}} as telerecordings.|$|R
5|$|The {{great variety}} of forms makes it <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> modern form is the most ancient one, and the words on which the {{interpretation}} are based are not found {{in many of the}} earliest records of the rhyme (see above).|$|E
5|$|A steepening of the {{subduction}} zone during the Late Miocene {{has been linked}} to an increase in volcanic activity and its westward migration, but it is <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pattern of activity in the southern Puna next to the Toro fault zone can be explained through this alone. A large low velocity and low seismic attenuation anomaly is found between 20 and 24° latitude south. Some geologic evidence, including geochemistry and geographic indicators, imply that lithospheric detachment did occur beneath the southern Puna.|$|E
5|$|A {{traditional}} {{definition is}} {{that to be a}} Cockney, one had to be born within the sound of Bow Bells, situated in Cheapside. In general, the sound pattern would cover most of the City, and parts of the near East End such as Aldgate and Whitechapel, but it is <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bells would have been heard in the docklands. In practice, with Royal London the only maternal hospital nearby, few would today be born within earshot.|$|E
50|$|Topical {{songs are}} usually written {{shortly after the}} events they describe. It {{therefore}} seems <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> either <b>the</b> Smiths or Johnson were the original author of this song.|$|R
25|$|A case of mistaken identity. This {{was judged}} <b>unlikely,</b> given <b>that</b> <b>the</b> killing {{took place on}} the {{doorstep}} of Dando's own home.|$|R
25|$|There {{has been}} a {{persistent}} but <b>unlikely</b> belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Library of Alexandria and its contents were destroyed in 642 during the Arab invasion.|$|R
5|$|According to Tough, it is <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{avoidance}} of immediate dangers {{and prevention of}} future catastrophes would be conducted through radio, as these tasks would demand constant surveillance and quick action. However, cultural cooperation might take place through radio or a space probe in the Solar System, as radio waves {{could be used to}} communicate information about advanced technologies and cultures to humanity.|$|E
5|$|Bowers {{does not}} cite any trade {{publication}} reviews for this film, making it <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> film was given attention in The New York Dramatic Mirror, The Moving Picture World or The Moving Picture News publications. The film was apparently a {{success at the}} Province Theater when it was shown in Vancouver. It is possible that non-advertisement reviews of the film may exist in other publications.|$|E
5|$|In 1812, when it {{appeared}} highly <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> King would recover, the Prince of Wales again failed to appoint a new Whig administration. Instead, he asked the Whigs to join the existing ministry under Perceval. The Whigs, however, refused to co-operate because of disagreements over Catholic emancipation. Grudgingly, the Prince of Wales allowed Perceval to continue as Prime Minister.|$|E
5000|$|Roy Brown, {{credited}} with shooting down the Red Baron {{although it is}} very <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> he fired <b>the</b> bullet.|$|R
50|$|His erotic {{drawings}} {{are particularly}} remembered, {{though it is}} <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> they were <b>the</b> typical work of a court painter.|$|R
5000|$|It is <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> any of <b>the</b> episodes still exist, as the BBC rarely telerecorded shows {{prior to}} the mid-1950s.|$|R
5|$|The St. Vrain {{massacre}} was {{an incident}} in the Black Hawk War. It occurred near present-day Pearl City, Illinois, in Kellogg's Grove, on May 24, 1832. The massacre was most likely committed by Ho-Chunk warriors who were unaffiliated with Black Hawk's band of warriors. It is also <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> group of Ho-Chunk had the sanction of their nation. Killed in the massacre were United States Indian Agent Felix St. Vrain and three of his companions. Some accounts reported that St. Vrain's body was mutilated.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the damage meant it was not {{possible}} to determine the exact source of ignition, but possibilities include an emergency generator and the depot's fire pump system. The investigators did not believe that it was caused either by the driver of a fuel tanker, as had been speculated, or by anyone using a mobile phone. It was felt <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> explosion had a widespread effect on air quality at ground level.|$|E
5|$|The name Bruce Castle {{is derived}} from the House of Bruce, who had {{historically}} owned a third of the manor of Tottenham. However, there was no castle in the area, and it is <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> family lived nearby. Upon his accession to the Scottish throne in 1306, Robert I of Scotland forfeited his lands in England, including the Bruce holdings in Tottenham, ending the connection between the Bruce family and the area. The former Bruce land in Tottenham was granted to Richard Spigurnell and Thomas Hethe.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>the</b> <b>unlikely</b> event <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tank {{integrity}} of a LNG transport is compromised, {{the natural gas}} would ignite immediately, causing a serious explosion or fire.|$|R

60|$|It {{seems as}} if the resistless torrent would some day tear away this lonely promontory, as it rushes upon and around it. It is not <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> course of ages the island may be carried away.|$|R
5|$|Wulfhelm {{also went}} to Rome to receive his pallium in person from Pope John X. Why he chose to go to Rome in person for his pallium rather than having it sent to him like most of his {{predecessors}} is unknown. One suggestion has been that {{because he had been}} translated from another see, Wulfhelm felt the need to have papal approval of his translation made explicit. Given the low status of the papacy at the time, it is <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> impetus for the change in tradition came from the pope.|$|E
5|$|After Maryland {{suffered}} a fifth {{loss in the}} season closer against Boston College, it was very <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> team's preferred postseason game, the Meineke Car Care Bowl, would extend an invitation. The game's selection committee in Charlotte, North Carolina was eager to secure nearby North Carolina (8–4). Meanwhile, the EagleBank Bowl, hosted by RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C., {{not far from the}} Maryland campus, secured in-state rival Navy, but the game date conflicted with Maryland's final exams. Soon after Maryland's regular season finale, sportswriters and analysts speculated that the Humanitarian Bowl in Boise, Idaho, was the most likely postseason destination. Bowl officials there worked to secure a game of undefeated teams between the hometown team, Boise State, and Ball State of the Mid-American Conference. However, Ball State rejected the proposal to play at Boise State's homefield as unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín {{began his}} term with many {{economic}} problems. The foreign debt was nearly 43billion dollars {{by the end}} of the year, and the country had narrowly prevented a sovereign default in 1982. During that year, the gross domestic product fell by 5.6%, and the manufacturing profits by 55%. Unemployment was at nearly 10%, and inflation was nearly 209%. It also appeared <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> country would receive the needed foreign investment. The country had a deficit of $6.7billion. Possible solutions such as a devaluation of the currency, privatization of industry, or restrictions on imports, would probably have proven to be unpopular.|$|E
50|$|Adults {{have been}} found among stems and root-crowns of Teucrium species, but it is <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> this is <b>the</b> host plant.|$|R
5000|$|It is <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> any of <b>the</b> episodes still exist, as {{the series}} aired live, and the BBC rarely telerecorded shows prior to 1953.|$|R
60|$|Learning, from them, {{that it was}} {{probable}} Lord Cornwallis would advance {{as soon as they}} rejoined him, Dick {{determined to}} go back to Bangalore, as it was <b>unlikely</b> <b>that,</b> after <b>the</b> severe check they had received, the Mahrattis would resume the offensive for a time.|$|R
5|$|Australia {{returned}} to Sydney in November 1921, and was paid off into reserve in December. By this time battlecruisers built before the Battle of Jutland were considered obsolete, {{and there is}} no record of the Admiralty suggesting that Australia purchase a replacement. Moreover, it is <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Australian Government would have agreed to such a suggestion given the prevailing political and financial conditions. As the Admiralty had decided to phase out 12-inch guns and had stopped the manufacture of shells for these weapons shortly after the war, it would have been necessary to replace Australias main armament once the Navy's stock of shells reached their expiry date given that {{it was not possible to}} produce replacement shells in Australia. This was also not financially feasible for the government, particularly given the RAN's lack of interest in retaining the ship.|$|E
5|$|Edin's Hall Broch in Berwickshire is {{the best}} {{preserved}} southern broch and although the ruins are superficially similar {{to some of the}} larger Orcadian broch villages it is <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tower was ever more than a single story high. There is an absence of Roman artefacts at this site. Various theories for the existence of these structures have been proposed, including their construction by northern invaders following the withdrawal of Roman troops after the Agricolan advance, or by allies of Rome encouraged to emulate the impressive northern style in order to suppress native resistance, perhaps even the Orcadian chiefs whose positive relationship with Rome may have continued from the beginnings of Romano-British relations.|$|E
5|$|Folklore often {{identifies}} a green {{sky with}} tornadoes, {{and though the}} phenomenon {{may be associated with}} severe weather, there is no evidence linking it specifically with tornadoes. It is often thought that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in atmospheric pressure inside a strong tornado, it is <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> {{determining}} whether <b>the</b> Rado graph models a given sentence {{can be done}} more quickly than exponential time, as the problem is PSPACE-complete.|$|R
25|$|It is {{extremely}} <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> any of <b>the</b> four elements above would cause {{loss of the}} aircraft, especially if the pilots react properly and work as a team.|$|R
5000|$|... {{except in}} <b>the</b> <b>unlikely</b> event <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game {{ends in a}} draw {{pursuant}} to the standard rules of chess, the game ends when one player either checkmates the opponent or captures the opponent's king.|$|R
