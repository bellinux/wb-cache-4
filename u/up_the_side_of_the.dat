5|$|Roope, who drowned when {{he could}} no longer hang on to a rope whilst being pulled <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cruiser, was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, thus {{becoming}} the first VC recipient of the Second World War. The award was justified, in part, by the recommendation of Heye, who wrote to the British authorities via the Red Cross, giving a statement of the valiant courage Roope had shown when engaging a much superior ship in close battle. Ramsay was also awarded the DSO. Both awards were made {{after the end of the}} war.|$|E

Certain machines, {{housed in a}} warehouse <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill, remove the parchment skins from the beans. Employees take the beans into the adjacent laboratory for the final quality control process – hand sorting – which is carried out by several experienced women. The beans are bagged and labeled according to their quality, and stored in the compound's warehouse to await sale.|$|E
5|$|There is a clifftop {{walk from}} Jacob's Ladder along {{the crest of}} the gorge and back to the road, with views of the gorge. A caving {{experience}} is offered within Gough's Cave. There is a path of 275steps, built <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gorge, known as Jacob's Ladder after the Biblical description of a ladder to the heavens. A watchtower at the top provides a 360–degree view of the entire area and village. An open-top bus tour operates during the summer. Cheddar cheese is made in {{the lower part of the}} gorge.|$|E

5|$|The lobby guard {{returned}} {{a call to}} the alarm monitoring service, which had called when the alarm initially went off to confirm that there was a fire, but never called the Philadelphia Fire Department. The first call came from someone on the street who saw smoke coming from the building. During the first 911 call, at about 8:27 PM, the alarm company alerted the fire department to the fire. Engine 43 was the first firefighting unit to arrive at the scene and reported seeing heavy smoke and flames in one of the windows. As firefighters started fighting the fire it had grown with flames breaking through windows and lapping <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building.|$|E
5|$|The route {{initially}} heads {{east from}} Watkins Glen to skirt {{the southern edge}} of the lake, but turns north upon exiting the village and passing the southeastern tip of the waterbody. Just outside Watkins Glen, NY414 comes to a fork. The left fork carries NY414 {{to the foot of the}} valley, bringing it very close to Seneca Lake. The right fork holds NY79, which travels <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> valley toward the village of Burdett. NY414 continues to parallel Seneca Lake, but gradually ascends the side of the lake valley as it heads north through the town of Hector and enters Seneca County.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the worsening security situation, William conducted his second northern campaign in 1069. He built another castle in York, on what is now Baile Hill {{on the west bank}} of the Ouse opposite the first castle, in an effort to improve his control over the city. This second castle was also a motte and bailey design, with the Baile Hill motte probably reached by a horizontal bridge and steps cut <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> motte. Later that year, a Danish Viking fleet sailed up to York along the Humber and the Ouse, and attacked both castles with the assistance of Cospatrick of Northumbria and a number of local rebels. The Normans, attempting to drive the rebels back, set fire to some of the city's houses. The fire grew out of control and also set fire to York Minster and, some argue, the castles as well. The castles were captured and partially dismantled, and Malet was taken hostage by the Danes.|$|E

5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurred at}} 8:45am. While {{the damage to}} Mont Blanc was not severe, it toppled barrels that broke open and flooded the deck with benzol that quickly flowed into the hold. As Imos engines kicked in, she quickly disengaged, which created sparks inside Mont-Blancs hull. These ignited the vapours from the benzol. A fire started at the water line and travelled quickly <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship as the benzol spewed out from crushed drums on Mont-Blancs decks. The fire quickly became uncontrollable. Surrounded by thick black smoke, and fearing she would explode almost immediately, the captain ordered the crew to abandon ship. A growing number of Halifax citizens gathered {{on the street or}} stood at the windows of their homes or businesses to watch the spectacular fire. The frantic crew of Mont-Blanc shouted from their two lifeboats to some of the other vessels that their ship was about to explode, but they could not be heard above the noise and confusion. As the lifeboats made their way across the harbour to the Dartmouth shore, the abandoned ship continued to drift and beached herself at Pier 6 near the foot of Richmond street.|$|E

25|$|The Wrekin can be {{accessed}} from the final junction on the M54 motorway (J7) before it turns into the A5 which continues to Shrewsbury. The hill is then signposted. There is a well-used footpath <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill which has an entrance {{at the end of}} the road off the M54. There is also a small car park and parking bays up the road. Between the Ercall and the Wrekin is a well positioned car park, at Forest Glen, allowing easy access to both areas. The ascent is steep in parts.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{concerns}} over wooden construction, the Composites employed a number of vintage, turn-of-the-20th-century mechanisms {{to reduce the risk}} of fire. Most commonly, this involved the use of asbestos, electrobestos, or the asbestos containing material transite. Since the adverse health effects of such were not yet fully known nor understood, asbestos was present in numerous locations throughout the car, most notably under the floors, and around any electrical wiring. All of the undercar electrical equipment was housed in steel boxes. Steel and wood were used to complement each other and give rigidity to the body by strengthening the frame. However, the side paneling of the car remained wood. But as an added fireproofing measure, the wood siding would be encased in a layer of copper sheathing that ran halfway <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car.|$|E
25|$|Once {{inside the}} Sodus village limits, {{the name of}} the road changes to West Main Street. NY88 remains on Main Street for two blocks to Carlton Street, at which point it turns southward onto Carlton Street and leaves Main Street as an unnumbered, village-maintained highway. The street {{continues}} eastward through the residential western portion of Sodus to the village's business district, where it intersects Maple Avenue and becomes East Main Street. It splits into two roads a block later: the upper road, which carries the East Main Street name and becomes known as Old Ridge Road outside of the village, climbs <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> escarpment while the lower road, State Street, runs along the base of the ridge. State Street itself splits two blocks later near a grade crossing with the Ontario Midland Railroad, with the eastern fork carrying the Ridge Road name.|$|E

5|$|Orographic or relief {{snowfall}} {{is caused}} when masses of air pushed by wind are forced <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> elevated land formations, such as large mountains. The lifting <b>of</b> air <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a mountain or range results in adiabatic cooling, and ultimately condensation and precipitation. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier, warmer air on <b>the</b> descending, leeward <b>side.</b> <b>The</b> resulting enhanced productivity of snow {{fall and the}} decrease in temperature with elevation means that snow depth and seasonal persistence of snowpack increases with elevation in snow-prone areas.|$|R
25|$|Along {{with most}} of the other rock {{formations}} of Yosemite Valley, El Capitan was carved by glacial action. Several periods of glaciation have occurred in the Sierra Nevada, but the Sherwin Glaciation, which lasted from approximately 1.3 million years ago (mya) to 1 mya, is considered to be responsible {{for the majority of the}} sculpting. The El Capitan Granite is relatively free of joints, and as a result the glacial ice did not erode the rock face as much as other, more jointed, rocks nearby. Nonetheless, as {{with most of}} the rock forming Yosemite's features, El Capitan's granite is under enormous internal tension brought on by the compression experienced prior to the erosion that brought it to the surface. These forces contribute to the creation of features such as the Texas Flake, a large block of granite slowly detaching from the main rock face about halfway <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cliff.|$|E

500|$|All of the {{surviving}} megalithic tombs from the Early Neolithic period have suffered from neglect and the ravages of agriculture. Although Ashbee noted that the Coldrum Stones represent [...] "Kent's least damaged megalithic long barrow", it too has suffered considerable damage, having become dilapidated and fallen apart over the six millennia since its original construction. Most prominently, the eastern side has largely collapsed, with the stones that once helped to hold <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barrow having fallen {{to the bottom of}} the slope. Conversely, it is possible that the sarsens at the bottom of the slope were not part of the original monument, but were stones found in nearby fields which were deposited there by farmers.|$|E

The circular grassed area between these buildings that was once known as the [...] "Eyes of the Ridings" [...] {{is now known as}} Castle Green, or the [...] "Eye of York". Clifford's Tower is the most prominent surviving part of the original medieval fortification, although the stone steps <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> motte are modern.

The fleet commander, Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer, was forced to give a general [...] "cease-fire" [...] order. München in turn spotted an imaginary submarine off Heligoland at 11:40 and opened fire on the empty sea.In the course of the battle, München was hit by a total of five medium-caliber shells, which killed eight men and wounded another twenty.
