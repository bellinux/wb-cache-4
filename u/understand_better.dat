Barbery confesses to having [...] "followed a long, boring course of studies in philosophy", and comments that [...] "I expected it to help me <b>understand</b> <b>better</b> that which surrounds me: but it didn't work out that way. Literature has taught me more. I was interested in exploring the bearing philosophy could really have on one's life, and how. I wanted to illuminate this process. That's where the desire to anchor philosophy to a story, a work of fiction, was born: to give it more meaning, make it more physically real, and render it, perhaps, even entertaining." ...|$|E
500|$|One of Bridget's first {{high-profile}} storylines was {{coping with}} a disability, after Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) hit Bridget with her car. She had been paralysed {{on one side of}} her body, the storyline saw her trying to regain the complete use of her body. Mignon explained during an interview with media reporting website Last Broadcast, the research that had been carried out and the effects on the character stating: [...] "Bridget suffers extreme physical difficulties as a result, because she's such a sporty tomboy, to be incapacitated suddenly poses emotional problems for her. To make sure that I could <b>understand</b> <b>better</b> what Bridget's going through, I studied medical notes on paralysis and disability on the internet." [...] The storyline also explored self-image issues that come with disabilities, in one episode Bridget was doing physiotherapy exercises and became in danger of drowning until Declan Napier (James Sorensen) saved her. He tried to kiss her but she fended off his advances, of this Mignon said: [...] "Bridget pushes him off, she fears he'll see her differently due to her disability." ...|$|E
500|$|Edward Teller {{was opposed}} to the hearing, feeling it was {{improper}} to subject Oppenheimer to a security trial, but was torn by longstanding grievances against him. He was called by Robb to testify against Oppenheimer, and shortly before he appeared Robb showed Teller a dossier of items unfavorable to Oppenheimer. Teller testified that he considered Oppenheimer loyal, but that [...] "in {{a great number of}} cases, I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer act – I understand that Dr. Oppenheimer acted – in a way which for me was exceedingly hard to understand. I thoroughly disagreed with him in numerous issues and his actions frankly appeared to me confused and complicated. To this extent I feel that I {{would like to see the}} vital interests of this country in hands which I <b>understand</b> <b>better,</b> and therefore trust more." [...] Asked whether Oppenheimer should be granted a security clearance, Teller said that [...] "if it is a question of wisdom or judgement, as demonstrated by actions since 1945, then I would say one would be wiser not to grant clearance." [...] This led to outrage by many in the scientific community and Teller's ostracism and virtual expulsion from academic science.|$|E

2500|$|In The Catholic Imagination (2000), Greeley's {{aim is to}} [...] "specify how the Catholic imaginative {{tradition}} {{differs from}} other versions of the Western Christian story." [...] It informs its research through the work of David Tracy, especially The Analogical Imagination: Christian Theology and the Culture of Pluralism (1981). This work suggests a strategy informed by an analogical imagination as {{an answer to the}} theological question of how to [...] "form a new and inevitably complex theological strategy that will avoid privatism" [...] in religious discourse that embraces pluralism. Greeley argues that the metaphor inherent in the Catholic imagination is indicative of the necessity to use metaphor in order to relate knowledge generally:Cognitive psychologists have recently begun to insist that metaphors – statements that one reality is like another reality – are the fundamental tools of human knowledge. [...] We <b>understand</b> <b>better</b> and explain more adequately one reality to ourselves by comparing it to another reality which we already know.|$|E
2500|$|Still, the {{possibilities}} of dynamic change in Seventh-day Adventist beliefs are not unlimited. [...] Those landmark doctrines are non-negotiables in Adventist theology. Collectively they have provided the Seventh-day Adventists with an identity. [...] The pillars of their faith—the Bible doctrines that define who they are as a people—have been thoroughly studied out in the Scripture and have been attested to by the convicting power of the Holy Spirit. [...] As Ellen White put it, [...] "When the power of God testifies {{as to what is}} truth, that truth is to stand forever as the truth. ... Men will arise with interpretations of Scripture which are to them truth, but which are not truth. [...] The truth for this time, God has given us as a foundation for our faith. [...] Robert Johnston noted, “Without repudiating the past leading of the Lord, it [...] seeks even to <b>understand</b> <b>better</b> what that leading was. [...] It is always open to better insights to learn—to seek for truth as for hid treasure. … [...] Adventists are still pilgrims on a doctrinal journey who do not repudiate the way marks, but neither do they remain stopped at any of them.” Ellen further said that there is more truth to be revealed and that true doctrine will stand close investigation. [...] But there is a solid foundation to build new truth upon.|$|E

The band was [...] "very confused" [...] after the split from Ross and Walker, desiring instead to go on tour to <b>understand</b> <b>better.</b> As evidenced above, [...] "Oh Glory" [...] and [...] "New Perspective" [...] were largely recorded {{during the summer of}} 2009 with producer John Feldmann. [...] "These songs are just Brendon and I having fun, because that's what we want to do," [...] Smith told MTV News. Shortly after the departure of Ross and Walker, Smith revealed the band was recording: [...] "We're working on an album now that, hopefully, takes the best parts from both of our records ... because we love them both and are really proud of them." [...] While on the Blink-182 Reunion Tour, Smith showed Blink-182 singer/bassist Mark Hoppus several demos for the album, in hopes that he would produce a song or two. Hoppus confirmed in August 2009 that he was committed to producing one [...] "really strong" [...] track on the record, as well as possible others if allowed. During this time, Urie told news outlets the band had [...] "about 10 songs" [...] ready to consider for the band's third album. In the beginning stages, a song featuring Rivers Cuomo of Weezer, whom Urie later described as [...] "super nice," [...] was set to appear on the new album, but the song is absent from the final track listing. The band initially planned to record the album in fall 2009, to be released the beginning of 2010.|$|E
