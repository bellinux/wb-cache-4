40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{one aspect of}} {{occupational}} dioxin exposure that is novel and unexpected. Exposures {{in excess of the}} German threshold limit value of 50 pg international toxicity equivalent (I-TEQ) /m 3 are very frequent, unpredictable, and sometimes very high [...] up to 6612 pg I-TEQ/m 3 [...] during thermal <b>oxygen</b> <b>cutting</b> at scrap metal and demolition sites. The same procedure involving virgin steel in steel trade and mass production of steel objects gave no such evidence, even though no final conclusions can be drawn because of the low number of samples analyzed. Low dioxin exposures during inert gas electric arc welding confirm previous literature findings, whereas soldering and thermal <b>oxygen</b> <b>cutting</b> in the presence of polyvinyl chloride give rise to concern. The consequences of occupational dioxin exposure were studied by analysis of the dioxin-blood concentration, the body burden, of men performing thermal <b>oxygen</b> <b>cutting</b> at scrap metal reclamation and demolition sites, in steel trade and producing plants as well as for industrial welders and white-collar workers. The results concerning body burdens are in excellent agreement with the dioxin exposure as characterized by dioxin air concentration in the workplace. The significant positive correlation between duration and frequency of performing thermal <b>oxygen</b> <b>cutting</b> at metal reclamation and demolition sites expressed in job-years and dioxin body burden speaks for the occupational origin of the observed overload after long times. The results reported here lead to consequences for occupational health, which are discussed and require immediate attention...|$|R

5|$|The {{skin of a}} frog is {{permeable}} to {{oxygen and}} carbon dioxide, {{as well as to}} water. There are blood vessels near the surface of the skin and when a frog is <b>underwater,</b> <b>oxygen</b> diffuses directly into the blood. When not submerged, a frog breathes by a process known as buccal pumping. Its lungs {{are similar to those of}} humans, but the chest muscles are not involved in respiration, and no ribs or diaphragm exist to help move air in and out. Instead, it puffs out its throat and draws air in through the nostrils, which in many species can then be closed by valves. When the floor of the mouth is compressed, air is forced into the lungs. The fully aquatic Bornean flat-headed frog (Barbourula kalimantanensis) is the first frog known to lack lungs entirely.|$|R
40|$|The {{discontinuous}} {{gas exchange}} (DGE) pattern of respiration shown by many arthropods includes periods of spiracle closure (C-phase) and is largely thought {{to serve as}} a physiological adaptation to restrict water loss in terrestrial environments. One major challenge to this hypothesis is to explain the presence of DGE in insects in moist environments. Here, we show a novel ecological correlate of the C-phase, namely, diving behaviour in mesic Paracinema tricolor grasshoppers. Notably, maximal dive duration is positively correlated with C-phase length, even after accounting for mass scaling and absolute metabolic rate. Here, we propose that an additional advantage of DGE may be conferred by allowing the tracheal system to act as a sealed <b>underwater</b> <b>oxygen</b> reservoir. Spiracle closure may facilitate underwater submersion, which, in turn, may contribute to predator avoidance, the survival of accidental immersion or periodic flooding and the exploitation of underwater resources...|$|R

Empirical models were developed using artificial neural networks and experimental data collected. Taguchi’s orthogonal array was implemented for experimental plan. From the analysis of the developed mathematical models it was observed that functional dependence between laser cutting parameters, their interactions and surface roughness characteristics is complex and non-linear. It was also observed that there exist region of minimal average surface roughness to ten-point mean roughness ratio. The relationship between average surface roughness and ten-point mean roughness was found to be nonlinear and can be expressed with a second degree polynomial...|$|R

The word "hybrid" is derived from the Latin and means "mixing or putting things together from different sources". The laser hybrid welding and cladding process describes the combination of the laser process and a conventional process to a new one. The first laser hybrid process was the laser <b>oxygen</b> <b>cutting</b> which is a combination of laser energy and a chemical energy coming from an exothermal reaction of the oxygen with the heated steel. The first known laser hybrid welding process was an arc process stabilized by a laser (M. Eboo et. al. 1978); the first laser welding process supported by or combined with an arc jet was presented by E. Beyer et. al. at the ICALEO Conference in 1994. Since that time different papers in laser arc and laser plasma hybrid welding have been presented by Fraunhofer followed by laser induction welding and cladding process. This process has been running in production for years now...|$|R

It is employed a technique previously developed in our laboratory consisting in using the nozzle as a large-sized Langmuir probe. Based {{on the behavior of}} the ion current signal and simple estimations, it is concluded that (1) the non-equilibrium plasma inside the nozzle is far from the steady state in time, in contrast to what is frequently assumed. The power supply ripple was identified as the main fluctuations source and (2) large-scale plasma fluctuations inside the nozzle could cause transient (total duration of the order of 100 μs) Townsend avalanches developing in the space-charge layer located between the arc plasma and the nozzle wall. Such events trigger the so called non-destructive double-arcing phenomena without appealing to the presence of insulating films deposited inside the nozzle orifice, as was previously proposed in the literature. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.

40|$|Dross free {{laser cutting}} is very {{important}} in the application of laser cutting technology. This paper focuses on the development of a fuzzy logic model to predict dross formation in CO 2 laser <b>oxygen</b> <b>cutting</b> of mild steel. Laser cutting experiment, conducted according to Taguchi’s experimental design using L 25 orthogonal array, provided a set of data {{for the development of a}} fuzzy rule base. The predicting fuzzy logic model is based on using Mamdani-type inference system. Developed fuzzy logic model considered the cutting speed, laser power and assist gas pressure as inputs. Using this model the effects of the selected laser cutting parameters on the dross formation were investigated. Additionally, 3 -D surface plots were generated to study the interaction effects of the laser cutting parameters. The analysis revealed that the cutting speed has the most significant effect, followed by laser power and assist gas pressure. The results indicated that the fuzzy logic modeling approach can be effectively used for the dross formation prediction in CO 2 laser cutting of mild steel...|$|R

The comparison is carried out for technologies of abrasive waterjet <b>cutting,</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>cutting,</b> laser and plasma cutting. As an experimental material, EN S 355 J 0 structural steel and titanium CP-Ti Grade 2 was used. Surface topography measurement was done using a Mitutoyo Surftest SJ- 401 instrument, and an optical profilometer MicroProf FRT was used for comparison and verification of acquired surface data. The aim of the contribution is to clarify, on the basis of experimental measurements, the behaviour of a topographic function after various ways of cutting; the knowledge of the function is necessary for solving both theoretical and practical technological tasks. The topographic function, which is a basis for the prediction of quality and control of the cutting processes, was derived in an original way. The use of individual technologies depends on technical and economical possibilities and on environmental influences.

40|$|At present, {{highly alloyed steels}} in the {{thickness}} range above 8 mm can be cut by laser radiation to only a limited extent: The high portion of alloying constituents is indeed reducing the thermal conductivity and thus the thermal losses during the cutting process. But on the other hand, especially with the most established laser cutting technique - laser <b>oxygen</b> <b>cutting</b> - the alloying elements are leading to detrimental effects even in the lower thickness range (1 - 4). Chromium oxides with a high melting point do not dissolve in the metallic melt. This condition causes a limitation of the exothermic reaction in {{the upper part of}} the cutting front. At the same time, the high viscosity of the oxide layer complicates the melt ejection. Thus, in the lower region of the cutting front, the oxide film is bursted by stagnating melt volume and subsequently an uncontrollable exothermic superreaction occurs. As is well known, this results in deep erosion, selective burning and high dross attachmen t. In order to solve these problems even in the sheet thickness range between 10 and 30 mm, 5 procedural variants of CO 2 laser beam cutting have been investigated and optimized...|$|R
40|$|In this work, an {{experimental}} {{study on the}} influence of the nozzle geometry on the physical properties of a cutting arc is reported. Ion current signals collected by an electrostatic probe sweeping across a 30 A <b>oxygen</b> <b>cutting</b> arc at 3. 5 mm from the nozzle exit were registered for different nozzle lengths. The temperature and density radial profiles of the arc plasma were found in each case by an inversion procedure of these signals. A comparison between the obtained results shows that the shorter nozzle (RN = 0. 50 mm, L N = 4. 5 mm operated at 0. 7 MPa and 35 Nl/min) produces a thinner and hotter arc than the larger nozzle (RN = 0. 50 mm, LN = 9. 0 mm operated at 1. 1 MPa and 20 Nl/min). This behavior is attributed to the marked difference of gas flow rate due to the clogging effect. A smaller gas mass flow reduces the convective cooling at the arc border and decreases the power dissipation of the arc column, resulting in small axis temperatures. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.

40|$|Direct {{applications}} of High Power Diode Lasers (HPDLs) like hardening, heat conduction welding of metals and joining of polymers {{have already been}} demonstrated also in the industrial environment. Relatively low intensities {{in the range of}} 10 (exp 3) Wcm(exp - 2) are sufficient for these applications. While the commercial HPDL systems are built on the basis of diode laser bars with 40 W output power, in the meantime a record cw-output power of 267 W per bar has been demonstrated. The achievable higher output power per bar will lead to enhanced applicability of HPDLs and thus to a further steep increase of their industrial use. Improved packaging technology, multiplexing the emission of single bars and coherent coupling as well as promising new diode laser structures like Z-shaped broad area emitters are discussed. In this report emphasis is laid on the potential applicability of commercial HPDLs for metal working with elevated intensities up to 10 (exp 5) Wcm(exp - 2), like <b>oxygen</b> <b>cutting</b> and the worldwide first deep penetration HPDL-weld up to a sheet thickness of 6 mm in stainless steel.
