5|$|The Mark 1 was {{to provide}} a {{computing}} resource within the university, to allow researchers to gain experience in the practical <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>computers,</b> but it very quickly also became a prototype on which the design of Ferranti's commercial version could be based. Development ceased at the end of 1949, and the machine was scrapped towards the end of 1950, replaced in February 1951 by a Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercially available general-purpose electronic computer.|$|E
5|$|Richardson {{envisioned a}} large {{auditorium}} {{of thousands of}} people performing the calculations and passing them to others. However, the sheer number of calculations required was too large to be completed without the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>computers,</b> {{and the size of the}} grid and time steps led to unrealistic results in deepening systems. It was later found, through numerical analysis, that this was due to numerical instability. The first computerised weather forecast was performed by a team composed of American meteorologists Jule Charney, Philip Thompson, Larry Gates, and Norwegian meteorologist Ragnar Fjørtoft, applied mathematician John von Neumann, and ENIAC programmer Klara Dan von Neumann. Practical use of numerical weather prediction began in 1955, spurred by the development of programmable electronic computers.|$|E
5|$|A {{high level}} of {{insulation}} was used to keep the building warm during the winter months. This approach, however, brings with it the potential problem of overheating during the summer due to solar heat gains through the glazing, body heat and the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>computers</b> and electric lighting. Standard {{solutions to the problem}} usually involve using energy intensive HVAC systems. The Scottish Parliament Building, however, reduces the requirements for such systems to only 20% of the accommodation by a variety of strategies. Natural ventilation is used wherever possible. A computerised management system senses the temperature {{in different parts of the}} Parliament and automatically opens windows to keep the building cool. During summer months, the building opens the windows during the night time when it is unoccupied and permits the heavy concrete floors and structure to cool and rid themselves of heat absorbed during the day. This then helps to keep the building temperature down during the day by absorbing the excess heat from the glazing, occupants and electrical equipment. Some of the concrete floors are further cooled by water from 25metres (80ft) deep bore holes beneath the parliamentary campus which also provide water for the toilet facilities. The building achieves the highest rating in the Building Research Establishment's Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM).|$|E

5|$|A {{personal}} dive {{computer is}} a small computer designed to be worn by a diver during a dive, with a pressure sensor and an electronic timer mounted in a waterproof and pressure resistant housing which has been programmed to model the inert gas loading of the diver's tissues in real time during a dive. A display allows the diver to see critical data during the dive, including the maximum and current depth, duration of the dive, and decompression data including the remaining no decompression limit calculated in real time for the diver throughout the dive. The dive computer keeps track of residual gas loading for each tissue used in the algorithm. Dive computers also provide a measure of safety for divers who accidentally dive a different profile to that originally planned. Most dive computers will provide the necessary decompression information for acceptably safe ascent {{in the event that}} the no-decompression limits are exceeded. The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>computers</b> to manage recreational dive decompression is becoming the standard and their use is also common in occupational scientific diving. Their value in surface supplied commercial diving is more restricted, but they can usefully serve as a dive profile recorder.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{animation}} industry traditionally drew every film cel by hand. This is labor-intensive and inefficient; the cels {{are generally}} non-reusable, and errors {{are difficult to}} correct. This method is called the 2D approach due to the conception of the source images in only two dimensions. The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>computers</b> and graphics software introduced computer graphics (CG) into the industry. This reduced waste; animators can reuse digital cels to correct errors and make changes. Increasing computer power spread the use of three-dimensional graphics software to create 3D models and environments, and render them as 2D images. This 3D approach requires more resources to create the 3D models, but production teams can correct errors or remake film sequences much faster than the traditional 2D approach. The 2D-3D hybrid approach in Karas was due to budget and aesthetic concerns. The 2D approach allowed greater artistic details and creativity, and the 3D approach could save resources. Sato, however, disapproved the common notion of using the 3D approach for economic concern. He pushed the team to enhance image quality with detailed CG. He was also dissatisfied with computer lighting effects, and ordered the animators to draw them by hand. Due to the bright colors of the original cels, they darkened the images and concentrated on areas where shadows should be, leaving untouched the areas where light falls on.|$|E

The respondents comprised 15 males and 15 females with ages between 16  years and 18  years. Two instruments, namely, Scale <b>of</b> Attitude toward <b>Computer</b> Technologies (SACT) and Barriers affecting Students’ Attitudes and Use (BSAU) were used to collect data. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) of Davis (1989) was utilized. The analysis of the study revealed gender differences in attitudes toward the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> technologies in learning English. Female students showed high and positive attitudes towards the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> technologies in learning English than males. Both male and female participants demonstrated high and positive perception of Usefulness and perceived Ease <b>of</b> <b>Use</b> <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> technologies in learning English. Three barriers that affected and limited the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> technologies in learning English were identified by the participants. These barriers are skill, equipment, and motivation. Among these barriers, skill had the highest effect, whereas motivation showed the least effect.|$|R

40|$|Technology {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the restructuring of education. However, there is continued disillusionment in the educational community regarding the effective <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> technology. Factors are identified and noted in related literature as contributors to the ineffective <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> technology. As the presence of technology continues to increase in the education, it is important for educational leaders and administrators to recognize the significance of their role in technology implementation and utilization. Educational Leaders should be effective role models and have a clear vision of the possibilities technology can provide. ^ This study was guided by the following research questions: (a) What types of tasks do middle school principals most use computer technology to complete? (b) Are there differences in the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> technology by middle school principals based upon the format <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> technology training received by middle school principals? (c) Are there differences in the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> technology by middle school principals based upon age, gender, or years of experience as educational administrators? (d) Are there differences in the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> technology by middle school principals based upon computer technology availability? ^ Data were obtained from a research sample of 66 middle school principals from ten counties located in the southeastern portion of North Carolina. The Principal 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Use</b> <b>of</b> <b>Computer</b> Technology survey questionnaire developed by Dr. Jack Dibee, served as the research instrument. Additional data collected by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction were used to determine computer technology availability at each school. ^ Data were analyzed using various statistical methods. Means for responses to individual items and grouped areas were used to illustrate comparisons of tasks and demographics. Analyses of data revealed that middle school principals used technology more for communications tasks like electronic correspondence and less for instructional leadership tasks, such as locating curriculum or staff development resources. Data analyses also indicated differences in the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> technology by middle school principals and computer technology availability related to management, communications and instructional leadership tasks. ...|$|R
