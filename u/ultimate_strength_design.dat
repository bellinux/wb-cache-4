This data will be of use in the validation of a mathematical model for motion and wave load predictions recently developed at the Department. Further, experimental data on slamming will also be acquired {{to lay a foundation}} for the future development of a reliable analytical model. Design loads pertinent to SWATHs comprising the extreme primary loads, lifetime cyclic loads and local panel pressures are then built upon the former findings to be of use in structural designs, especially in the determination of initial scantlings and fatigue characterisation. Examples are given throughout on the evaluation of hypothetical SWATHs operating in the North Atlantic. The underlying theoretical formulation of SWATH ship motions is presented together with a description of a newly developed motion prediction theory. This is followed by a clarification of the procedures for conducting seakeeping tests on SWATH models. Validation of the analytical motion model by the measured data of single and tandem strut SWATH models is then presented. Subsequently, practical applications of implementing motion predictions to the assessment of SWATH operatiblity in real seaways are described. Theoretical background of SWATH primary wave loads is briefly outlined. The enhancement of the motion program MARCHS to tackle the primary load on SWATHs is described. The development of experimental data on SWATH loadings by way of seakeeping techniques is presented.

40|$|Abstract. Disposable {{mechanical}} elements with extremely short {{lives are}} widely used in the aerospace and defense fields. To reliably evaluate the life of disposable mechanical elements, many attentions were concentrated in the fatigue properties of disposable mechanical elements. According to the different meanings of static strength for metals, disposable mechanical elements are {{divided into two groups}} with different fatigue properties: extremely low cycle fatigue module for Type I with <b>ultimate</b> <b>strength</b> as <b>design</b> stress and low cycle fatigue module for Type II with yield <b>strength</b> as <b>design</b> stress. The Kuroda model and a cumulative damage model consisting of the Miner’s rule and the sequential law are used in the fatigue design process of the Type I. To the Type II, the Manson-Coffin model is suitable for conventional applications but more attempts are still conducted to further improve stress levels. The Type II with increasing load sequences are specially treated, since the cyclic yield strength of certain materials under pulsating stress closing to the yield strength increase with the deepening of fatigue damage. Consequently, under the increasing pulsating cyclic loading, the later load whose amplitude is higher than the initial yield strength will be permitted.

40|$|Abstract]: Double skin {{composite}} (DSC) panels are constructed by filling concrete between two steel plates welded with stud shear connectors at a regular spacing. Steel plates in DSC panels used as two-way slabs or shearwalls may buckle locally between stud shear connectors when subjected to in-plane biaxial compression. This paper investigates {{the local and}} post-local buckling behaviour of biaxially compressed steel plates restrained by shear connectors and concrete in DSC panels by using the finite element modelling technique. Local buckling coefficients are obtained for steel plates with various aspect ratios, biaxial loading and boundary conditions by incorporating the shear stiffness effect of stud shear connectors. These buckling coefficients {{can be used to}} determine limiting width-to-thickness ratios for steel plates and the distribution of stud shear connectors. A geometric and material non-linear analysis is undertaken to quantify the post-local buckling strength of steel plates under biaxial compression. The initial imperfections of steel plates and non-linear shear-slip characteristics of stud shear connectors are taken into account in the post-local buckling analysis.

40|$|Synopsis: A durable, {{efficient}} and effective infrastructure system is fundamental to economic prosperity, social justice and political stability, and the Quality of Life. Civil engineering infrastructure is the most costly to create, develop and maintain, and is thus an invaluable national asset for any country. There is, however, massive and growing evidence that our infrastructure systems are deteriorating at an alarming and unacceptable rate. All the evidence that we have of material degradation and structural damage shows that the current <b>ultimate</b> <b>strength</b> <b>design</b> procedure is no longer valid or relevant – indeed fundamentally flawed – for sustainable development of the construction industry for the 21 st century. This paper advocates a Holistic Durability Design Philosophy –an integrated material and structural design strategy – of Strength through Durability rather than of Durability through Strength where materials are manufactured for Durability rather than for Strength, and structures are designed for Ductility and Structural Integrity. Holistic Design envisages a global approach to all aspects of concrete and construction technology integrating material characteristics with in-situ performance. Use of cement replacement materials, design for material stability, design for structural integrity and design for sustainability are shown {{to be the key}} elements to achieve durable service life performance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract]: The {{availability}} of high strength steels and concrete {{leads to the}} use of thin steel plates in concrete-filled steel tubular beam-columns. However, the use of thin steel plates in composite beam-columns gives a rise to local buckling that would appreciably reduce the strength and ductility performance of the members. This paper studies the critical local and post-local buckling behavior of steel plates in concrete-filled thin-walled steel tubular beam-columns by using the finite element analysis method. Geometric and material nonlinear analyses are performed to investigate the critical local and post-local buckling strengths of steel plates under compression and in-plane bending. Initial geometric imperfections and residual stresses presented in steel plates, material yielding and strain hardening are taken into account in the nonlinear analysis. Based on the results obtained from the nonlinear finite element analyses, a set of design formulas are proposed for determining the critical local buckling and ultimate strengths of steel plates in concrete-filled steel tubular beam-columns. In addition, effective width formulas are developed for the <b>ultimate</b> <b>strength</b> <b>design</b> of clamped steel plates under non-uniform compression. The accuracy of the proposed design formulas is established by comparisons with available solutions. The proposed design formulas can be used directly in the design of composite beam-columns and adopted in the advanced analysis of concrete-filled thin-walled steel tubular beam-columns to account for local buckling effects...|$|E

40|$|The stress–strain {{characteristic}} of concrete developed in flexure {{is one of}} the essential parameters for the <b>ultimate</b> flexural <b>strength</b> <b>design</b> of reinforced concrete (RC) members. Currently, the stress–strain curve of concrete developed in flexure is obtained by scaling down the uniaxial stress–strain curve. In current RC design codes, it is represented by an equivalent rectangular concrete stress block depending solely on the concrete strength. By comparing the theoretical strength evaluated for the stress block with the measured strength, the authors found that current codes underestimate the actual flexural strength of RC beams and columns by 9 % and 19 %, respectively. Since the underestimation is different for beams and columns, which are subjected to different strain gradients at ultimate, it is suggested that the maximum concrete stresses developed in flexure should depend also on strain gradient. The effects of strain gradient on the concrete stress developed in flexure were investigated in this work by testing RC columns under concentric and eccentric axial loads or horizontal loads. The concrete stress–strain curves of the eccentrically/horizontally loaded specimens were derived by modifying those of concentrically loaded counterparts based on axial force and moment equilibriums. The results indicate that the maximum concrete stress developed in flexure depends significantly on strain gradient. Formulas were developed to correlate the maximum and equivalent concrete stresses developed in flexure to the strain gradient. Their applicability was verified by comparing the results with measured flexural strengths of RC beams and columns. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

Their principle applications for today's engineers {{are listed in the}} early pages of the paper. Both the Working Stress theory and the Ultimate Strength theory for the design and analysis of doubly reinforced beams are thoroughly presented. The assumptions that these two theories are based upon are listed and discussed one by one. The formulas used in the design and analysis of these beams are developed and all the applicable ACI Codes for Reinforced Concrete are mentioned and explained. Although the inaccuracies of the Working Stress method are becoming more apparent with each additional piece of test data, it was included for historical interest since <b>ultimate</b> <b>strength</b> <b>design</b> is now being used almost exclusively. Due to the use of highly stressed steels and the designing of doubly reinforced beams by the ultimate strength method, the control of deflections becomes an absolute necessity. The prediction of instantaneous deflection is presented in this report as well as longtime deflection caused by shrinkage and by creep. Finally, the inelastic behavior of simply supported doubly reinforced concrete beams under cyclically repeated and reversed loads is also presented. Their response is predicted on the basis of technical beam theory and stress-strain relations of steel and concrete under cyclic loading. This theory is then compared to a series of tests conducted at the University of Colorado on doubly reinforced concrete beams subjected to variable repeated and reversed loadings...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 48) Most of {{the work}} done {{in the field of}} structural optimization has been done by assuming that the structure was constructed of a homogeneous material, such as steel (2), (6). Only a small amount of work has been done in the field of reinforced concrete structures; and, much of that is limited to isolated structural elements (2), (3). The objective {{of this study was to}} apply structural optimization theory to a statically indeterminate reinforced concrete structural system. The structure selected for study was a reinforced concrete slab-column system. It was assumed to be a symmetrical system comprised of a flat slab supported by circular columns at the interior and by a continuous wall around its perimeter. System loading included uniform static gravity loading only. Lateral loads (e. g. seismic and wind) were not introduced and the effects of pattern loading (i. e. live load skip loading) were not considered structural analysis was performed by using approximate methods. Column axial loads were determined from tributary area (5) and the Direct Design Method for Two Way Slabs (1) was employed to determine slab and column bending moments. For this project, the optimum structural system was defined as the system which resulted in the minimum ???in place??? (material plus labor) cost while satisfying all design constraints. A computer program, incorporating mathematical programing (6), was developed to optimize the slab-column system. The optimization technique employed was a modified Monte Carlo (3) minimization algorithm.

40|$|The {{subject matter}} of these notes refers to the <b>Ultimate</b> <b>Strength</b> <b>Design</b> of 2 -D steel framed {{structures}} and in particular {{to the analysis of}} the deformation state at collapse. The idea is based on the consideration that, if the structure at its collapse condition is subjected to an articulated movement, similar and concordant to the crisis motion, this will not change the stress state of the system. This motion is known once a single parameter is fixed, namely the displacement of a point or the rotation of a beam. When the collapse mechanism of the structure is already determined through any instrument of the Limit Analysis, a subsequent (k+ 1) plastic hinge can be arbitrarily fixed and assumed as the last developed one. It is therefore possible to solve the modified scheme through the rotation method and make a comparison in the verses between the known plastic moments and the rotations at the corresponding hinges. If the comparison is successful, {{in the sense that the}} checked verses are concordant, the selected hinge is actually the one formed as the last. On the contrary, the rotations resulting from an imprinted motion in the verse of collapse movement are algebraically added. If, for each hinge, the product between the plastic moment and the correspondent algebraic sum is made, this product has to be surely positive, due to the verses concordance. This can be translated in k+ 1 inequalities, with each one furnishing a lower limit for the parameter from which the articulated motion depends. Among these, the highest value is that one which makes all the inequalities to be simultaneously verified. The substitution of this value into the expressions for rotations permits to arrive to the simultaneous identifying of the last hinge and of the complete picture of deformations...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether Limit Design could be applied to low-rise unbraced concrete frames. The investigation was carried out both analytically and experimentally. In the analytical part, two mathematical models were used to determine the behavior of unbraced frames. The first method used a nonlinear computer program, which takes into account the material and geometric nonlinearities of concrete frames. Several cases of frames with different reinforcement ratios and under different beam to column load ratios were investigated. For each frame the gravity loads were increased proportionately to 3 / 4 of the ultimate frame capacity. Then, lateral load was applied to failure while keeping the beam and column loads constant. The second mathematical model solved for the frame stability equation by assuming elasto-plastic moment curvature relationships for members. Also, the stability solution was carried out by reducing the frame to a column attached to a linear spring. In the experimental part, two frames were designed for the same loading conditions but by two different methods; and were tested to failure. Frame USD- 1 was designed by the <b>Ultimate</b> <b>Strength</b> <b>Design,</b> while Frame LD- 1 by a Limit Design method. The columns were 21 -in high while the beam was 84 -in long. The loading procedure consisted of proportionately loading the beam and columns up to the design load, and then applying the lateral load to failure. The computer study and the stability model solution showed that frames subjected to low column thrusts remained in stable equilibrium until two plastic hinges form, thus constituting a mechanism. The two experimental frames remained in stable equilibrium until two plastic hinges formed in the beams. The ultimate lateral loads of Frames USD- 1 and LD- 1 exceeded the design lateral load by 66 % and 33 %, respectively. Based on this investigation, it appears that Limit Design may be used for low-rise unbraced reinforced concrete structures...|$|E

After vigorous research, the auther proposed the calculation method of ultimate flexural moment. Particularly, {{it should be noted}} that world-widely spreaded doubt for the fatigue fracturing of unbonded tendons at end anchorage portion against the earthquake cyclic high-over loads was wiped up by showing detailed low-cycle fatigue test results on unbonded tendon-anchorage assembly and unbonded beams. In 1980 's, research on partially prestressed concrete had been carried out and skillful method of determining the required prestressing force and its eccentricity was proposed based on the lood-balancing method. This method was adopted in the first design recommendation on the AIJ partially prestressed concrete buildings. In addition to these researches, the author conducted research works on high-strength concrete, shear problem on reinforced concrete members and ductility improvement of concrete and structural concrete members, etc. Especially, on the shear problem, based on the fundamental concept that a part of applied shear force is carried by the truss mechanism and remaining by the strut mechanism, a set of calculation formulae on the shear failure strength was proposed. Also, test method for predicting the efficiency of shear reinforcement had been newly developed and the fact that the use of high strength shear reinforcement having 600 to 1300 Mpa in yield strength is essential for fully avoiding of shear failure, particularly in case of the member with high-strength concrete. As the ductility enhancement ofstructural concrete concerns, experiments covering wide-range of concrete strengths from 24 to 130 Mpa and yield strength of confining reinfcrcement from 160 to 1300 Mpa had been conducted on concrete prisms and structural concrete members including reinforced concrete columns and prestressed concrete members. From the test results it showed that the compressive ductility of concrete as well as that of structiral concrete members can be enhanced remarkably by the use of high strength lateral confining reinforcement. Also, the stress-strain curve models for confined concrete to be applicable to the wide-range concrete strength from 24 to 160 Mpa was presented. And further,the flexural ductility design procedure had been proposed based on those research results. Recent development of reinforced concrete high-rise buildings in Japan is owing to such author's research results on ductility enhancement of concrete and structural concrete members by high-yield strength lateral confining reinforcement...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} few decades, the {{emphasis}} in structural design of ships has moved from the allowable stress design to the ultimate limit state design. The ultimate limit state represents {{the collapse of the}} structure due to loss of structural stiffness and strength. Recently IACS CSR projects for tankers and bulk carriers introduced the first real implementation of calibrated ULS rule requirements. As a result, {{there is a need to}} compare and harmonize structural requirements for different ship types, not only the tankers and bulk carriers separately. This thesis deals with the ultimate strength and reliability-based design of ship hull girders with particular emphasis on combined global and local loads. The ultimate strength of both stiffened panels and hull girder under combined loadings was investigated numerically using FE analysis. The stiffened panel is assumed to be under pitting corrosion. This is considered to be relevant for conventional ships, e. g. tankers and bulk carriers. The ultimate strength of the hull girder under combined global and double bottom bending was also investigated. The possibility of applying simplified approaches, such as linear elastic approach or simplified progressive collapse approach, for a hull girder under combined loads was discussed in this thesis. The development of a semi-probabilistic design format for <b>ultimate</b> <b>strength</b> <b>design</b> of ship hulls under combined global and local loads was discussed. The thesis consists of four papers presenting the main findings as well as a summary part giving the context of the work. Here it is shown that thickness” model does not represent the true structural b plate under pitting corrosion. The main parameters of influence were found to be the level of DoP (Degree of Pitting), the smallest sectional area and the location of concentration of pits. It is also shown that the ultimate hull girder strength of a bulk carrier under AHL condition is significantly reduced as a result of combined global and double bottom bending. The FE analyses showed that an interaction exists between the initial imperfections and combined global and local loads which depend upon the geometry of the hull girder and loading conditions. The difference in the stress distribution in both longitudinal and transverse directions may cause first failure to occur at a different location. Based on the results obtained by FE analyses, it was found that the linear approach yields very conservative results. It is also shown that a linear elastic analysis of a multi span “strip-beam” model of the double bottom could be applied to include the rotation of the double bottom into a “Smith-type” progressive collapse approach. The most viable simplified method suitable to deal with combined global and local loads in design was found to be an interaction formula based on an “effective weighted average” pressure that depends upon the average outside pressure and average inside pressure. A linear elastic approach with first failure criterion was found to be practical for the time being. Regarding reliability-based design of ship hulls, it was found that the most relevant definition of characteristic still-water load for tankers and bulk carriers is μ+ 1. 5 σ (with μ = mean and σ = standard deviation), while μ+ 2. 24 σ is more relevant for container vessels. For bulk carriers and other vessels with significant double bottom bending, it was shown that the interaction formula results in a consistent safety level. The effect of high correlations between global and local loads for both still-water and wave loads was found to be relatively important. It was shown that for container vessels, the effect of nonlinearity on the failure probability is less for hogging than the sagging, because wave loads in hogging contrary to sagging wave loads are less sensitive to nonlinearity. The container vessels had approximately the same failure probability as the other main class vessels, given that the flexibility of the ship hull is properly accounted for. The safety level for different ships was found to be in reasonable harmony. PhD i marin teknikkPhD in Marine Technolog...|$|E

The North American steel industry is actively performing research studies and developing design standards {{to assist in the}} cost-effectiveness of cold-formed steel in these markets. Cold-formed steel L-headers are structural components used over wall openings to transfer the loads to adjacent king studs. Recently, there has been an increased interest in L-headers among homebuilders primarily due to their ease of installation and low material cost. Design of the L-headers in North America is currently governed by the North American Standard for Cold Formed Steel Framing – Header Design, in combination with the North American Specification for Design of Cold Formed Steel Structural Members. However, the design provisions in the AISI - Header Design Standard are particularly limiting. For instance, the method for evaluation of span deflections for both single and double L-headers, and uplift flexural strength for single L-headers is currently not available primarily due to lack of research on the issues. Presented in this thesis are the findings from an extensive laboratory testing program of full-scale single and double cold-formed steel L-headers. The objective of the research was to investigate the structural behavior of L-headers under both gravity and uplift loads. From the analysis, improved <b>ultimate</b> flexural <b>strength</b> <b>design</b> expressions and new vertical deflection expressions for single and double L-header assemblies were developed. The concept of semi-rigid members was introduced to evaluate the flexural behavior and deflection performance of L-header assemblies...|$|R
