5000|$|Some therapies {{associated}} with classical conditioning are aversion therapy, systematic desensitization and flooding.Aversion therapy {{is a type}} of behavior therapy designed to make patients cease an <b>undesirable</b> <b>habit</b> by associating the habit with a strong unpleasant unconditioned stimulus. For example, a medication might be used to associate the taste of alcohol with stomach upset. Systematic desensitization is a treatment for phobias in which the patient is trained to relax while being exposed to progressively more anxiety-provoking stimuli (e.g. angry words). This is an example of counterconditioning, intended to associate the feared stimuli with a response (relaxation) that is incompatible with anxiety [...] Flooding is a form of desensitization that attempts to eliminate phobias and anxieties by repeated exposure to highly distressing stimuli until the lack of reinforcement of the anxiety response causes its extinction. [...] "Flooding" [...] usually involves actual exposure to the stimuli, whereas the term [...] "implosion" [...] refers to imagined exposure, but the two terms are sometimes used synonymously.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} objects of a {{language}} course is to enable students to produce foreign sentences {{in accordance with the}} usage particular to the language being studied. Japanese students of English, in the main, have traditionally been trained in the skill of translation, which has tended to foster them word-for-word translation habit because of their mother tongue perpetually intervened between English and Japanese, and vice versa, thus preventing them from direct association. Therefore their expressions in English cannot help being influenced by the patterns of the native language and thought. One of the ways to break off with this <b>undesirable</b> <b>habit</b> is for the teacher to assign them tasks for free composition under a given title. My students have been required to write a three-page essay once a month for the past year, and I have tried an analysis of their writing in the light of grammar and usage, classified the patterns of errors found in them, and had a rough idea of their frequency. Most notable of the mistakes they made are concerned with verbs and phrasal verbs, adjectives, prepositions and nouns and noun groups including appositive clauses. It is to be hoped that the students should be thoroughly trained in fundamental working knowledge of contemporary English...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In recent years, the deteriorations {{of living}} habits like im-mobilization or {{unhealthy}} diet are becoming serious social problems in many developed countries. Even {{if we know}} the importance, {{it is difficult to}} change our <b>undesirable</b> <b>habits</b> and to maintain a desirable lifestyle. This study demonstrates a concept called ambient lifestyle feedback sys-tems to be used to motivate people to change their <b>undesirable</b> <b>habits</b> to improve their lifestyle. In the concept, aesthetic and empathetic ex-pressions reflect the feedback of the user’s current behavior to the user. When keeping desirable habits, the user is offered with a feedback expres-sion designed to boost his positive emotion. When turning to <b>undesirable</b> <b>habits,</b> the feedback expression is changed to increase the user’s negative emotions. In this paper, we present brief overviews of four case studies of ambient lifestyle feedback systems, and discuss several findings that we while designing and evaluating the case studies. Future directions will also be discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In recent years, the deteriorations {{of living}} habits like {{immobilization}} or unhealthy diet are becoming serious social problems in many developed countries. Even {{if we know}} the importance, {{it is difficult to}} change our <b>undesirable</b> <b>habits</b> and to maintain a desirable lifestyle. Previous studies have suggested that persuasive technology can {{play a significant role in}} persuading individuals for behavioural change. In the article, we discuss the design of persuasive ambient displays aimed at addressing this issue borrowing theories from behavioural psychology. In our design, aesthetic and empathetic expressions are used to represent the visualisation reflecting behavioural feedback of an individual. If an individual’s behaviour is leaned towards healthier lifestyle, the display expression is designed to boost his/her positive emotion where as display expression is progressively shifted to increase negative emotion of the individual if he/she does not sustain the desirable behaviour. In this paper, we introduce design principles of our approach and present four case studies to show the applicability of our approach. We also discuss a number of issues uncovered during the design and evaluation of these case studies...|$|R

40|$|The {{widespread}} pursuit for {{the thin}} physique may have detrimental {{impact on the}} wellbeing of the young generation, especially females. This study aimed {{to determine the effect}} of wanting very low body weight on dietary habits and psychological factors of female adolescents. Participants were 619 girls from 5 high schools in Kyeonggi, Korea. Information on dietary behaviors, psychological factors as well as current heights and weights and the desired weight for current height were obtained by questionnaire. Of total subjects, 38. 1 %, 35. 5 %, and 26. 5 % desired weights corresponding to normal (10 ~ 85 percentile), low (3 ~ 10 percentile) and very low BMI (< 3 percentile), respectively. The subjects who wanted to be very low weight had the average BMI of 18. 57 kg/m 2, which was significantly lower than 21. 21 kg/m 2 of those who wanted to be normal weight (p < 0. 001). The subjects who desired very low weight had significantly higher scores for depression symptoms (p < 0. 05), while there were no differences in obsession to lose weight and obesity stress. Moreover, more subjects in this group had <b>undesirable</b> dietary <b>habits</b> such as eating fast foods more than weekly (p < 0. 05). These findings suggest that the desire for extreme thinness may lead female adolescents to have not only unreasonably similar obesity stress and obsession to lose weight but also higher depression symptoms, along with <b>undesirable</b> dietary <b>habits.</b> The findings suggest the potential harm from excessive weight concerns of female adolescents; thus efforts to teach this group about healthy weights are urgently needed...|$|R
5000|$|Mainly {{there are}} two types of {{medication}} therapies used for aversion, they are Antidipsotropic and Effect - altering agents. A strong precedent of the successful effects of aversion therapy is identified with Naltrexone, an opioid-dopamine release pathway inhibitor and Disulfiram, an acetaldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor. This enzyme is responsible for a portion of the metabolism of alcohol and, when inhibited, causes hangover-like effects almost immediately after consuming alcohol, thus promoting an unpleasant association with a chemical dependence. However, most patients never drink on it because they are aware of the negative effect, and instead, use it to help counter urges to drink while they are developing other coping skills and hope that over time the craving for alcohol will be extinguished from not being reinforced. Prior studies have shown Antabuse brings relief to the majority of its users, describing, [...] "Patients who could not remain sober from one visit to the next achieved many months of continuous sobriety."More recent studies have compared aversion to [...] "Minnesota Model" [...] programs and have found patients matched on 17 baseline characteristics, to have higher abstinence rates at 6 and 12 months with the aversion.Traditional aversion therapy, which employed either chemical aversion or electrical aversion while effective, is commonly replaced with aversion imagery, a technique which is known as covert sensitization. Covert sensitization, or covert conditioning, involves provoking mental imagery to create associations with <b>undesirable</b> <b>habits.</b> While the efficacy of covert conditioning may be comparable to that of more-prevalent techniques in aversion therapy, these treatments may be combined to enhance an individual's likelihood for success in ending an unwanted habit.|$|R
40|$|As mobile {{computing}} and smartphones become an integrated {{part of our}} lives, the time individuals spend on social networks has significantly increased. Moreover, a link has been established between the uncontrolled use of social networks {{to the development of}} <b>undesirable</b> <b>habits</b> and behaviors including addictions. One such behavior, namely, fear of missing out (FOMO) is of particular interest and concern especially because of the widespread use of smartphones and computers, and thereby extensive use of social networks by the younger generation. This study establishes the relationships between FOMO and various social networks in an attempt to identify the problematic use of social media in Turkey and discover variables relevant to FOMO. The main objective of the study is to examine the prevalence of FOMO in preservice teachers. A total number of 363 preservice teachers on various academic courses were employed {{for the purpose of this}} study. The design was a survey which utilized a standardized questionnaire on FOMO together with a demographic questionnaire to explore the impact of the usage of smartphones and social networks by preservice teachers. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, independent samples t-tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA). The overall findings of the study showed that the spread of FOMO amongst preservice teachers is at intermediate level. Significant differences were also found between groups based on gender, age, and usage of social networks. Furthermore, data from males were indicative of higher FOMO levels than female preservice teachers and again, under 21 s were found to have higher levels of FOMO compared to the other age groups. A significant relationship was reported between being online on social networks throughout the day and active use of social media over seven hours, and FOMO. Furthermore, preservice teachers using Twitter, Instagram, Swarm, or Snapchat have increased levels of FOMO. Implications are discussed within current models...|$|R

Aviation industry has done a lot, especially in the realms of training and aircraft design to improve safety. The industry should not just maintain the current level of safety but improve it further. Besides enormous associated costs, accidents still occur. This study sought to show that ethics, particularly Aristotelian virtues in pilot training, can not only improve quality but also enhance efficiency and consequently minimize costs. The study set out to investigate if the people involved in pilot training consider virtues to be necessary for pilot training; which virtues they consider as most important; and how the virtues could be incorporated in a pilot training scheme. Descriptive survey design and naturalistic designs were used. Students and instructors/managers were randomly and purposively sampled using questionnaires and interview guides. Though scarce, the related literature was also reviewed. The findings of the literature review and questionnaires/interviews both confirmed that indeed virtues are needed in pilot training. All the cardinal virtues are preferred though in varying order of preference by the different categories of respondents. The study found that virtues can be incorporated in pilot training schemes through classroom training, through role models and reward and punishment for desirable and <b>undesirable</b> <b>habits</b> respectively, and through a dedicated code conspicuously displayed in training venues; but not through ruthless enforcement by punishment. The study recommended virtue training to be adopted by airlines as it enables pilots to easily observe regulations and comply with the tenets of Crew Resource Management among other benefits such as happiness and good working relationships which can enhance error management and greatly reduce accidents. Further research was recommended on how airlines and regulators can monitor compliance with virtues among pilots. Properly adopted, virtues can not only make training efficient but also help produce better pilots and consequently safer flight operations...|$|R

For the first time the people in Amsterdam from Dutch origin are a minority. This brings on the question who should adapt to who? Super-diversity draws a new perspective in the debate on integration. It argues that we are standing at a crossroads. On the one hand the multi-ethnic city is a fact: {{for the first time the}} people from Dutch origin are a minority in Amsterdam, just like all the other ethnic groups. On the other hand the idea of the multicultural society is increasingly viewed as naive, since cultural equality opens the door for <b>undesirable</b> cultural <b>habits,</b> like the repression of women. Super-diversity offers a progressive alternative for the failed idea of multiculturalism and the worn-out call from politicians for migrants to adapt to Dutch values. In his view, the key to a successfully diverse society lies in the emancipation of second generation women. Super-diversity carries out a vision of hope. But there is also urgency to it.

Students had the highest ratio for eating breakfast everyday and spent 10 - 20 minutes eating breakfast. Students went to bed at 10 - 11 PM and woke up at 7 - 7 : 30 AM in the morning on average. The biggest reason for skipping breakfast was insufficient time in the morning. Additionally, favorite breakfast menu of subjects was a Korean style meal. The number of elementary students that recognized necessity of nutritional education was highest among subjects. Favorite educational method of subjects was education by teachers. Additionally, number of female students that recognized effect of breakfast on health status was significantly higher than boy students. Ratio of eating breakfast everyday was dependent on BMI value. Most subjects preferred video learning materials as the main nutritional education method.

We tested the hypothesis that maternal feelings about pregnancy might be associated with their attitude towards promoting healthy lifestyles in their children. We used a city database collected from guardians of 204 randomly selected children aged 1 to 3 years in Nihonmatsu City, Fukushima. Maternal feeling about pregnancy was measured using a 10 -point scale, and a child lifestyle score was calculated as the sum of desirable lifestyle habits (sleeping, eating, watching TV/videos, and tooth brushing). Associations between maternal feeling and her child's lifestyles were examined with multiple logistic regression analysis. For all lifestyle items, proportion of children with <b>undesirable</b> lifestyle <b>habits</b> was higher in the "unhappy group" (those who scored 1 to 9) than in the "happy group" (those who scored 10). In particular, a child's short sleeping hours (odds ratio [OR]= 3. 01) and lifestyle score of less than 3 ([OR] = 3. 60) {{were significantly associated with}} unhappy feelings. This was apparent among mothers aged 29 (median age) or younger. Our results indicate an association between a mother's unhappy feelings about pregnancy and her child's undesirable lifestyle, especially among relatively younger mothers. These findings provide public health implications important for early familial intervention to improve children's lifestyles...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aim: Adolescence is the {{transition}} period between childhood and adulthood, a period in life that begins at puberty. It {{is one of the}} fastest growth periods in a persons life. During this time, physical changes affect the bodys nutritional needs, while changes in ones lifestyle may affect eating habits and food choices. Nutritional health during adolescence is important for supporting the growing body and for preventing future health problems. In Iran, the prevalence of anemia, obesity, and other chronic nutritional diseases has increased in recent years due to <b>undesirable</b> eating <b>habits.</b> This survey was conducted to determine consumption of the four major food groups (vegetables, fruits, milk products, and meat) among a group of high school students in Zanjan Province, Iran. Methods and Materials: A descriptive, cross-sectional study was carried out on 1500 students, selected by random cluster sampling, in Zanjan high schools, Iran in 2005. The daily intakes of the 4 food groups during the previous week were determined using a food frequency questionnaire. The potential determinants of the pattern of food consumption were also determined. Results: The proportions of the students not having consumed fruits, vegetables, and meat during the weak were 16 %, 6. 8 %, and 10 %, respectively. More than 95 % of the students said that they had consumed milk/milk products at least once a day. Only 8. 7 % consumed fruits and 27 % consumed vegetables 3 times or more daily. Conclusion: The consumption of the 4 food groups of large proportions of Zanjan Province adolescents is below the current recommendations. Health and nutrition educational programs would be a valuable tool to correct erroneous food habits of the adolescents leading to improvements in their nutritional status...|$|R

Dietary intakes of subjects were estimated by 24 hour dietary recall method. Also we analysed iron indices and pregnancy outcomes. We classified subjects by 10 point, which was the average depression score, into two groups [Low depression score group (LS) : High depression score group (HS) ]. As to the intakes of total calcium, plant-calcium, plant-iron, potassium, total folate and dietary folate, LS group was far higher than HS group (P < 0. 05, P < 0. 05, P < 0. 01, P < 0. 001, P < 0. 05, and P < 0. 01, respectively). As to pre-pregnancy alcohol drinking, LS group had 41. 9 % in non-drinker, which was far higher than 28 % in HS group in non-drinker (P < 0. 05). As for drinking coffee during pre-pregnancy, pregnant women who don't drink coffee in LS group took 43. 6 %, which was higher than 38 % in HS group (P < 0. 01).

DESIGN AND SETTING [...] This cross sectional study was based on data of the 1987 - 1988 Dutch national food consumption survey (DNFCS), obtained from a panel by a stratified probability sample of the non-institutionalised Dutch population. PARTICIPANTS [...] 3781 adults (1802 males and 1979 females) of the DNFCS, aged 19 to 85 years, were studied. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] To estimate dietary intake two day food records were used. Lifestyle factors were collected by structured questionnaire and sociodemographic variables were available from panel information. Cluster {{analysis was used to}} classify subjects into groups based on similarities in dietary variables. Subsequently, these groups were characterised by sociodemographic and lifestyle factors {{as well as by the}} consumption of food groups. Eight clusters were found. In comparison with the guidelines, the dietary quality in four clusters was poor. The cluster with the poorest dietary intake (high intake of fat, cholesterol, and alcohol; low intake of dietary fibre) showed on average a high consumption of animal products (except milk), fats and oils, snacks, and alcoholic beverages, and a low consumption of fruit, potatoes, vegetables, and sugar rich products. Smoking, body mass index, dietary regimen on own initiative, hours of sleep, gender, age, socioeconomic status, and day of the week were found to discriminate among the clusters. CONCLUSIONS [...] Cluster analysis resulted in substantial differences in mean nutrient intake and seems useful for dietary risk group identification. <b>Undesirable</b> lifestyle <b>habits</b> were interrelated in some clusters, but an exclusive lifestyle for health risk has not been found...|$|R

Constructive thought pattern strategies include visualizing successful performance, self-talk and evaluating beliefs and assumptions. Visualizing successful performance is the cognitive imagination {{in the mind of the}} individual before facing the situation. Visualizing successful performance increases the possibility of fulfilling the task effectively due to the mental rehearsal prior to the task (Houghton and Neck 2002). Self-talk is defined as the quiet talk of the individual with him/herself or as the internal talk, and it involves mental self-evaluations and reactions (Houghton and Neck 2002; Neck and Houghton 2006). Evaluating beliefs and assumptions include the evaluation of habits, thinking methods or models that are developed by individuals. According to Ho and Nesbit (2009), evaluating beliefs and assumptions concerns ‘examining one’s thoughts, especially self-defeating thoughts that detract from successful task performance’ (p. 454). Evaluating beliefs and assumptions aims to help one to eliminate <b>undesirable</b> and dysfunctional <b>habits</b> (Houghton and Neck 2002; Ho and Nesbit 2009). Consequently, it is made possible by constructive thought pattern strategies that individuals use their experiences and/or thoughts positively and develop the desired behaviors (Houghton and Neck 2002; D’Intino et al. 2007). And so, SL strategies improve individual effectiveness in the organizations (DiLiello and Houghton 2006).|$|R

About <b>habits</b> (Smoking, using weight loss food regimen and using weight loss drug) the highest percent of cases (74. 9 %) had desirable lifestyle. Also there was a significant statistical relationship between life style and variables of education level (p= 0. 004), economical status of family (p= 0. 043), the birth number in family (p= 0. 001) and educational level of mother (p= 0. 005). Conclusion: According to the results of research, lifestyle of 50 % of female teenagers was undesirable. Findings of this research are attentive and need more assessment and planning by responsible people in order to omitting noted problems in lifestyle...|$|R

H 577 P RS 2015 Xuxv, 248 pages :color illustrationsWork {{behavioral}} automaticity (WBA) can {{be characterized}} as a learned and goal-directed behavioral response to the environment through frequency and reinforcement of movement. However, little research has been conducted into the mechanism underlying how WBA leads to the development of work-related musculoskeletal symptoms (WMS). This thesis reports on four studies, each of which examine different aspects of how WBA in the workplace relate to the development of WMS. Study 1 was a cross-sectional survey of the prevalence of, and risk factors for, WMS in the catering industry. The results showed that the most prevalent form of WMS was shoulder pain amongst Chinese chefs (71. 7 %). The frequency of movement (such as wrist bending and exertion) was the main risk factor contributing to the development of WMS. Based on the results of Study 1, Study 2 was an onsite ergonomic assessment of the risk factors contributing to WMS for Chinese chefs in a medium-sized restaurant. The results showed that standing for prolonged periods, poor manual handling postures, lifting heavy objects, and frequent and repetitive upper limb movements were the four main risk factors contributing to WMS. Moreover, such work behaviors were characterized by a high degree of automaticity; conducted without conscious awareness or intention, they had become habits. Drawing on the findings of Study 2, study 3 therefore used grounded theory to explore the formation of WBA and its underlying mechanisms. The results show that workplace behavior is heavily goal oriented. Initially, novel behaviors involved in work tasks are experienced as requiring cognitive effort, but as such effort increases and behavioral training is applied, automaticity increases and the behavior becomes easier. The more <b>undesirable</b> work <b>habits</b> one has, the higher the probability one will suffer from some form of WMS. Study 4 drew on the foregoing to develop a validated and reliable questionnaire to measure WBA in a group of Chinese chefs, followed by a case-control study to identify the characteristics of workers with or without WMS. A 51 -item self-report WBA Scale (WBAS) emerged from this analysis. The WBAS demonstrated high test-retest reliability (0. 630 - 0. 929) and internal consistency (0. 653 - 0. 755). A four-factor structure for the instrument was identified through principal component analysis with varimax rotation. Criterion validity was established using C-WSF and WBAS (r=- 0. 57, p< 0. 01). The results of hierarchical logistic regression showed that environmental factors (OR= 0. 884), safety awareness (OR= 1. 417), and risk-taking beliefs (OR= 1. 261) predicted the development of WMS. All three predictors were subjected to further statistical testing and the results demonstrated that they {{play an important role in}} the formation of WBA in the workplace and hence contribute to the development of WMS.
