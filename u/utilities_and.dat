40|$|K-anonymisation is an {{approach}} to protecting privacy contained within a dataset. A good k-anonymisation algorithm should anonymise a dataset {{in such a way}} that private information contained within it is hidden, yet the anonymised data is still useful in intended applications. However, maximising both data <b>utility</b> <b>and</b> privacy protection in k-anonymisation is not possible. Existing methods derive k-anonymisations by trying to maximise utility while satisfying a required level of protection. In this paper, we propose a method that attempts to optimise the trade-off between <b>utility</b> <b>and</b> protection. We introduce a measure that captures both <b>utility</b> <b>and</b> protection, and an algorithm that exploits this measure using a combination of clustering and partitioning techniques. Our experiments show that the proposed method is capable of producing k-anonymisations with required <b>utility</b> <b>and</b> protection trade-off and with a performance scalable to large datasets. 1...|$|R

Aetna Corporation, the fire insurer, claimed that girders above the 19th level could be repaired and used cutting $115 million in repair costs from the owner's $250 million estimate.
