25|$|This {{higher energy}} state is unstable, and the atom will emit an <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>photon</b> as the atom's {{electron}} reverts to a lower, more stable, energy level. Most of the photons that are {{released from the}} mercury atoms have wavelengths in the ultraviolet (UV) region of the spectrum, predominantly at wavelengths of 253.7 and 185 nanometers (nm). These are not visible to the human eye, so they must be converted into visible light. This is done by making use of fluorescence. Ultraviolet photons are absorbed by electrons in the atoms of the lamp's interior fluorescent coating, causing a similar energy jump, then drop, with emission of a further photon. The photon that is emitted from this second interaction has a lower energy {{than the one that}} caused it. The chemicals that make up the phosphor are chosen so that these emitted photons are at wavelengths visible to the human eye. The difference in energy between the absorbed ultra-violet photon and the emitted visible light photon goes toward heating up the phosphor coating.|$|E

50|$|Photoemission {{spectroscopy}} (PES), {{also known}} as photoelectron spectroscopy, refers to energy measurement of electrons emitted from solids, gases or liquids by the photoelectric effect, {{in order to determine}} the binding energies of electrons in a substance. The term refers to various techniques, depending on whether the ionization energy is provided by an X-ray photon, an EUV photon, or an <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>photon.</b> Regardless of the incident photon beam, however, all photoelectron spectroscopy revolves around the general theme of surface analysis by measuring the ejected electrons.|$|E
5000|$|Near ultraviolet, visible light, infrared, microwave, radio waves, and low-{{frequency}} {{radio frequency}} (longwave) are all examples of non-ionizing radiation.

Visible and near ultraviolet electromagnetic radiation may induce photochemical reactions, or accelerate radical reactions, such as photochemical aging of varnishes or the breakdown of flavoring compounds in beer to produce the [...] "lightstruck flavor". Near ultraviolet radiation, although technically non-ionizing, may still excite and cause photochemical reactions in some molecules.

50|$|A Lyman-Werner photon is an <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>photon</b> with a photon {{energy in}} the range of 11.2 to 13.6 eV, {{corresponding}} to the energy range in which the Lyman and Werner absorption bands of molecular hydrogen (H2) are found. A photon in this energy range, with a frequency that coincides with that of one of the lines in the Lyman or Werner bands, can be absorbed by H2, placing the molecule in an excited electronic state. Radiative decay (that is, decay into photons) from this excited state occurs rapidly, with roughly 15% of these decays occurring into the vibrational continuum of the molecule, resulting in its dissociation.

By increasing the laser intensity up to 500 mW, a downshift and a broadening of the optical phonons are observed corresponding to a temperature of 1000 °C. The UV Raman measurements are free of blackbody radiation. We find that the linewidth changes for the G+ and G− bands differ considerably in single-wall carbon nanotubes. This gives evidence that the phonon decay process is different in axial and radial tube directions. We observe the same intrinsic linewidths of graphite (highly oriented pyrolytic graphite) for the G band in single- and double-wall carbon nanotubes. With increasing temperature, the interaction between the walls is modified for double-wall carbon nanotubes. <b>Ultraviolet</b> <b>photon</b> induced transformations of peapods are found to be different on silica and diamond substrates...|$|E

40|$|The {{detection}} efficiency, assumed {{proportional to}} the count rate, of an <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>photon</b> counting imaging system based on the Ge induction readout is studied. For the Ge induction readout, the system count rate with different Ge layer resistances, Ge layer thicknesses and ceramic thicknesses are tested under different light intensities. The test {{results show that the}} system count rate with a high resistance in the Ge layer is lower than that with a low resistance in the Ge layer; further, the imaging area decreases as the Ge layer resistance increases under high photon flux. Moreover the system count rate with a thick Ge layer is lower than that with a thin Ge layer. In addition, the system count rate with 2 -mm ceramic is higher than that with 1. 5 - and 3 -mm ceramic.
