40|$|The {{intertidal}} herbivorous snail Planaxis sulcatus (Born) showed different avoidance {{behavior in}} response to crushed conspecifics than that to whole or crushed Morula anaxeres (Kiener). Addition of a crushed conspecific to pools containing P. sulcatus caused most individuals to move until they had reached crevices, but addition of the predatory gastropod M. anaxeres caused most P. sulcatus to move upward <b>until</b> they were <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> submerged. Planaxis sulcatus that had moved to crevices {{in response to}} crushed conspecifics climbed upward <b>until</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> submerged after M. anaxeres was added to pools. It is suggested that crushed conspecifics are a cue for shell-crushing predators, which may be escaped by moving to crevices. However, such behavior provides little or no protection against a drilling gastropod compared with climbing upward <b>until</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> submerged. The rapid and almost unanimous avoidance response of P. sulcatus was contrasted with the less uniform and relatively slower responses of two temperate species, Littorina unifasciata Philippi and Littorina cincta Quoy & Gaimard, to their local predators. It is suggested that differences in avoidance behavior may indicate increased predation pressure at lower latitudes...|$|R

50|$|A {{language}} implementation cannot easily support full closures if its run-time memory model allocates all automatic {{variables on}} a linear stack.

40|$|BACKGROUND—Femoral vessel {{catheterisation}} {{is generally}} avoided in the neonatal period because of technical difficulties {{and the fear}} of complications.  AIM—To review the use of femoral arterial and venous catheters inserted percutaneously on the neonatal intensive care unit.  METHODS—Infants admitted to one of two regional neonatal intensive care units who underwent femoral vessel catheterisation were identified. Information collected included basic details, indication for insertion of catheter, type of catheter and insertion technique, duration of use, and any catheter related complications.  RESULTS—Sixty five femoral catheters were inserted into 53 infants. The median gestational age was 29 weeks (range 23 - 40). Twenty three femoral arterial catheters (FACs) were inserted into 21 infants and remained in situ for a median of three days (range one to eight). Twelve (52 %) FACs remained in place <b>until</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> required, and four (17 %) infants developed transient ischaemia of the distal limb. Forty two femoral venous catheters (FVCs) were inserted into 40 infants and remained in situ for a median of seven days (range 1 - 29). Twenty seven (64 %) FVCs remained in place <b>until</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> required, and eight (19 %) catheters were removed because of catheter related bloodstream infection.  CONCLUSIONS—FACs and FVCs are useful routes of vascular access in neonates when other sites are unavailable. Complications from femoral vessel catheterisation include transient lower limb ischaemia with FACs and catheter related bloodstream infection. ...|$|R
