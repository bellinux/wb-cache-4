5|$|The Varaha, in the 83 {{verses of}} Chapter 2, {{explains}} to Ribhu {{how to achieve}} the most exalted knowledge of Brahmavidya, and then what it is. He tells Ribhu that the four means of this knowledge are to practice conduct of one's Varna (caste) and one's Ashrama (stage in life), from ascetic austerity {{and with the help}} of a Guru (spiritual teacher). The Varaha then states that the path to Brahmavidya is through the capacity to distinguish between the ephemeral and the eternal, detachment from the material world <b>unto</b> <b>the</b> spiritual world. A sincere longing for spiritual liberation and six virtuous qualities (shama) are essential in order to achieve Brahmavidya, asserts the Upanishad, these being tranquility, self-restraint, doing work without craving for rewards, endurance, faith, and meditation. Varaha states in verse 2.4 that the truly blessed are those who know Brahman and Atman and have thus become one with them.|$|E
5|$|The seventh {{match was}} the 14-Diva single-fall Vickie Guerrero Divas Championship Invitational for the WWE Divas Championship; this marked {{the only time}} the title was defended at WrestleMania. The match started with the other wrestlers attacking {{champion}} AJ Lee and her bodyguard, Tamina Snuka. As the match progressed, Aksana met Naomi at the top rope and Natalya slipped under Aksana to perform a powerbomb superplex combination. Tamina pulled Aksana out of the ring to prevent Natalya from winning, so Natalya clotheslined Tamina on the outside but was prevented from re-entering the ring due to AJ kicking her. AJ applied her signature Black Widow hold on Naomi and won the match, thus retaining her title. WWE reported that AJ won by moving Naomi's hand <b>unto</b> <b>the</b> mat to deceive the referee into thinking that Naomi had submitted.|$|E
