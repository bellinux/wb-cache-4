50|$|The {{reproduction}} of these moths begins with <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>signals</b> sent {{out by the}} males {{in order to attract}} their female partners. The typical mating spot for these moths is in honeybee colonies, and the males can be seen there anywhere between six and ten hours in just a single night. Females are attracted to these <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>signals</b> in any one of three ways; peak amplitude, signal rate, and the asynchrony interval. Studies have been conducted that show these moths increase their signal rate when having to compete with others for the right to a local female, but due to the physical demands of an increased signal rate, its duration typically lasts only five to ten minutes. It has been concluded that these are the most prevalent few minutes of the entire six to ten hours spent out each night.|$|E

40|$|The {{effective}} {{deployment of}} Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) in indoor hostile environment demands high precision localization for navigation purposes. The cricket system, based on Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) approach, provides precise localization. It calculates TDoA between radio and <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>signal</b> to estimate distance between two cricket motes. The position, in the referenced coordinate system, is estimated by multilateration using estimated distances from multiple motes. Therefore, the position accuracy {{depends on the}} distance estimation which in turn depends on the TDoA calculation. Ultrasonic transducer, a component of cricket mote hardware, has highly directive radiation pattern which affects <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>signal</b> detection. This delayed detection of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>signal,</b> based on distance and relative angle, introduces error in the distance estimation between a pair of two cricket motes. A low cost, easy to implement error correction method is developed in this thesis to remove error introduced by delayed <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>signal</b> detection. Relationship between error (in distance estimation), relative angle and distance between two cricket motes is derived using traditional regression analysis. This relationship is then used to predict and correct error involved in the distance estimation.

Considering not only system requirements but also technology cost, we used, for the conception of our tool, ultrasonic sensors and one monocular camera to enable user being aware of the presence and nature of potential encountered obstacles. In this paper, we are involved in using only one ultrasonic sensor to detect stair-cases in electronic cane. In this context, no previous work has considered such a challenge. Aware that the performance of an object recognition system depends on both object representation and classification algorithms, we have used in our system, one representation of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>signal</b> in frequency domain: spectrogram representation explaining how the spectral density of signal varies with time, spectrum representation showing the amplitudes {{as a function of the}} frequency, periodogram representation estimating the spectral density of signal. Several features, thus extracted from each representation, contribute in the classification process. Our system was evaluated on a set of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>signal</b> where stair-cases occur with different shapes. Using a multiclass SVM approach, recognition rates of 82. 4 % has been achieved.
