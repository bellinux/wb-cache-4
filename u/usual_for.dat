5|$|Audition {{was shot}} in {{approximately}} three weeks, which was about one more week than <b>usual</b> <b>for</b> Miike's films at the time. Scenes {{such as those in}} Asami's apartment and at a restaurant were shot on location in a real apartment and a real restaurant. Outdoor scenes were shot in Tokyo, along intersections in Omotesandō.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{had little}} formal education. He {{lived with his}} {{grandfather}} {{so that he could}} receive a common education at Donald Robertson's school with James Madison and John Taylor of Caroline. He was also tutored at home, as was <b>usual</b> <b>for</b> Virginian planters' children of the period. His grandfather trained him to be a surveyor.|$|E

5|$|Linnaeus was {{relieved}} of his duties in the Royal Swedish Academy of Science in 1763, but continued his work there as <b>usual</b> <b>for</b> {{more than ten}} years after. He stepped down as rector at Uppsala University in December 1772, mostly due to his declining health.|$|E
5|$|The engine can {{accommodate}} high-load operating conditions {{and has been}} designed for low-speed operation. It can carry up to 260kilograms. The hovercraft is equipped with GPS and the construction costs are lower than <b>usual</b> <b>for</b> this type of vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Darius' initial {{response}} was defensive: he immediately stockaded the river bank with stakes to impede the enemy's crossing. A core vanguard of traitorous Greek mercenaries and Persian royal guard was established; as was <b>usual</b> <b>for</b> Persian kings, Darius positioned {{himself in the}} centre of this vanguard, in order that he might effectively dispatch commands to any part of his large army. A group of Persian light infantry was soon sent to the foothills, as it was suspected that Alexander would make an approach from the right, away from the coast. A mass of cavalry commanded by Nabarsanes occupied the Persian right.|$|E

5|$|Kvale {{hoped that}} {{his friend and}} fellow Minnesotan, Senator Henrik Shipstead, could persuade {{sculptor}} Gutzon Borglum to design the medal for no fee or a nominal one. Borglum, who was busy with construction at Stone Mountain in Georgia (he would later sculpt Mount Rushmore), had designed the Stone Mountain Memorial half dollar; he {{had no time to}} accept the work. Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser, a member of the Commission of Fine Arts, was engaged for a fee of $1,500, about the <b>usual</b> <b>for</b> a commemorative coin.|$|E
5|$|Queens consort in the 20th century {{arrived at}} their {{coronation}} bareheaded, and remained so until {{the point in}} the service when they were crowned with their own crown. In the late 17th century and 18th century, queens consort wore Mary of Modena's State Diadem. Prior to the 20th century it was not <b>usual</b> <b>for</b> queens dowager to attend coronations, but Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother both attended the coronations of George VI and Queen Elizabeth II respectively, and each wore the crown, minus its arches, with which she had been crowned {{for the duration of the}} service.|$|E
5|$|Some {{features}} of the accessory glands in the male genital region vary among oryzomyines. In Transandinomys talamancae, {{a single pair of}} preputial glands is present at the penis. As is <b>usual</b> <b>for</b> sigmodontines, there are two pairs of ventral prostate glands and a single pair of anterior and dorsal prostate glands. Part {{of the end of the}} vesicular gland is irregularly folded, not smooth as in most oryzomyines.|$|E

5|$|The MCC team which toured Australia in 1907—08, {{like that}} which toured South Africa, faced {{questions}} about its strength. Because {{at least four}} first-choice players chose not to tour, and another was not selected despite strong claims, the team was less representative than <b>usual</b> <b>for</b> an Ashes series. The tourists lost the Tests 4–1, although Wisden suggested that the series was more competitive than suggested by the results.|$|E
5|$|The Sundance Channel airings {{attracted}} more viewers in the 18-to-24 age range than was <b>usual</b> <b>for</b> their audience, which typically comprised men over age 25. After the second episode aired, cultural critic Lee Siegel {{wrote about the}} show for The New Republic. He pontificated on transgender experience, and characterized the story as a unique form of drama or tragedy. In his introduction, he commented on the general absence of reviews for the show in major news publications.|$|E
5|$|The upper incisors are opisthodont, {{with the}} chewing edge located behind the {{vertical}} {{plane of the}} incisors. As is <b>usual</b> <b>for</b> the genus, the molars are brachyodont, low-crowned, and bunodont, with the cusps higher than the connecting crests, and accessory crests such as mesolophs are present. On the upper first molar, the frontmost cusp, the anterocone, {{is divided into two}} small cusps in young individuals, connected by a crest, but the two fuse with wear.|$|E

5|$|Ace Attorney Investigations 2 was {{produced}} by Motohide Eshiro and directed by Takeshi Yamazaki, and features character designs by Tatsuro Iwamoto and music by Noriyuki Iwadare. Takuro Fuse, who would later become the character designer and art director for Ace Attorney, {{was in charge of}} the game's event images, and the opening and ending sequences to the episodes. While the original Ace Attorney Investigations had taken longer than <b>usual</b> <b>for</b> an Ace Attorney game to develop due to its several new gameplay systems that had to be created from scratch, Ace Attorney Investigations 2 went faster due to it already having a base game to build upon, resulting in the developers being able to put more focus on the game's story. According to Eshiro and Yamazaki, one of the major changes compared to the first Ace Attorney Investigations was the addition of an interrogation game mechanic; they chose to present it metaphorically as a game of chess, which was Edgeworth's favorite game. Another such change was the graphical improvements to the game's sprites and background art.|$|E
5|$|An active trough of low {{pressure}} exited the East Coast of the United States on May 12, {{and by the}} following day it passed near Bermuda. Initially the trough was located only near the surface, though as cold air from behind it advanced eastward, the trough extended into the mid- to upper-levels of the atmosphere. By May 14 a closed {{low pressure}} area developed in seclusion from the westerlies. Continued cold air from behind the trough, about 12°F (7°C) colder than <b>usual</b> <b>for</b> the time of year, extended across the low in conjunction with warm upper levels and warm sea surface temperatures, resulting in large amounts of instability. The polar trough gradually weakened as the low organized, and on May 15 it developed into a subtropical depression while located about 300miles (480km) south of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|Arrowslits, also {{commonly}} called loopholes, were narrow vertical openings in defensive walls which allowed arrows or crossbow bolts {{to be fired}} on attackers. The narrow slits were intended to protect the defender by providing a very small target, but {{the size of the}} opening could also impede the defender if it was too small. A smaller horizontal opening could be added to give an archer a better view for aiming. Sometimes a sally port was included; this could allow the garrison to leave the castle and engage besieging forces. It was <b>usual</b> <b>for</b> the latrines to empty down the external walls of a castle and into the surrounding ditch.|$|E

5|$|As the {{aircraft}} flew eastwards over the outer suburbs of Perth numerous witnesses observed {{that it was}} flying at a lower altitude than <b>usual</b> <b>for</b> the daily Skymaster services, {{and at least one}} of the engines was running roughly and backfiring at regular intervals. In the minutes before it crashed, witnesses heard a number of different engine noises – sometimes operating normally, sometimes all engine noise ceased, only to be replaced by a very loud, high-pitched scream. When the wrecked engines were examined many weeks after the accident a significant amount of corrosion product was found in the fuel system within two of the engines. After a preliminary investigation, Investigators from the Department of Civil Aviation believed the water responsible for the corrosion was also responsible for rough running of at least one engine, and ultimately temporary loss of power from all engines on at least one occasion. The Investigators did not find a likely source for the water.|$|E
5|$|In large cities, a {{majority}} of working people and students eat their lunch at a corporate or school cafeteria, which normally serve complete meals as described above; it is not <b>usual</b> <b>for</b> students to bring their own lunch food. For companies that do not operate a cafeteria, it is mandatory for white-collar workers to be given lunch vouchers {{as part of their}} employee benefits. These can be used in most restaurants, supermarkets and traiteurs; however, workers having lunch in this way typically do not eat all three dishes of a traditional lunch due to price and time constraints. In smaller cities and towns, some working people leave their workplaces to return home for lunch. Also, an alternative, especially among blue-collar workers, eating sandwiches followed with a dessert; both dishes can be found ready-made at bakeries and supermarkets for budget prices.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{parliamentary}} election after the war, in 1945, Meisdalshagen was re-elected {{for a second}} term in Parliament. It was not clear that he would be nominated for the ballot, as this was not at all <b>usual</b> <b>for</b> those Labour Party members who in the summer of 1940 had agreed to the King's abdication. However, Meisdalshagen's service in Milorg probably tipped the scales in his favour. He {{was a member of the}} Standing Committee on Finance and Customs and secretary of the Preparatory Credentials Committee, and also became a member of the Standing Committee on Justice in December 1946. Meisdalshagen was also board chairman of the Norwegian State Housing Bank from 1946 to 1953.|$|E
