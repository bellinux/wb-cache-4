[...] The presence of faults or closely spaced joints can render the stone unusable. [...] These faults and joints do not have to be at odd angles in the stone mass. [...] Closely spaced, wrongly spaced, or nonparallel bedding planes can make the stone unusable, particularly if the bedding planes are planes of weakness.

50|$|The core {{focus of}} the Spectrum Policy Task Force is to ensure the {{efficient}} and effective use of the radio spectrum. The radio spectrum currently being used plays {{a vital role in}} a vast amount of government and commercial services. These services include radio and television broadcasts, satellite communications, wireless networks, public safety communications, weather forecasting, etc. The radio spectrum is the section of the electromagnetic spectrum that spans from about 3 kilohertz to 300 gigahertz. Television broadcasts, radios, mobile phones, and military and government communication systems are best operated in the 100 MHZ to 3GHz radio spectrum. The current use of the spectrum is mostly focused on the lower 1% of these frequencies. With the gradual increases in technological innovation and wireless communication, the <b>usable</b> <b>part</b> of the radio spectrum has also been greatly expanded. From here on, there will only be gradual increases in the technology and devices that depend on the radio spectrum for their functionality. The National Telecommunication and Information Administration (NTIA) deals with radio spectrum policies on the international level as well as federal government use of the radio spectrum. The allocation of the radio spectrum differs around the globe, but since electromagnetic waves travel the same way through the air, spectrum management decisions are generally coordinated internationally. The Federal Communication Commission’s (FCC) primary focus is on all the nonfederal, state, and local governments’ use of the spectrum. To manage the spectrum, both the NTIA and FCC used the “command-and-control” approach; they dictated how each segment of the radio spectrum is used and who is eligible to use it. The command-and-control approach worked in the initial days of wireless communication, but {{in order to meet the}} needs of new technology innovations and modern mobile devices using wireless communication, a policy was required that was more consumer-oriented. The FCC formed a task force—the Spectrum Policy Task Force—whose primary role was to evaluate changes in the spectrum policy, ensure the efficient and effective use of the spectrum, and derive public benefit from the use of the spectrum.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{conducted}} a survey on rodent crop damage among farmers in the hinterland of Kisangani (Democratic Republic of Congo). We studied the amount of crop damage, the rodent groups causing crop damage, the growth stages affected and the control techniques used. We conducted this survey in three municipalities using a standard questionnaire form translated into local languages, between November 2005 and June 2006 and during July 2007. We used the Quotas method and interviewed 70 households per municipality. Farmers indicated rodent groups implicated in crop damage on color photographs. Two types of survey techniques were used: individual and focus-group surveys. The sugar cane rat, Thryonomys sp. and Lemniscomys striatus caused most damage to crops, but inside granaries, Rattus rattus was the primary pest species eating stored food supplies and causing damage to stored goods. Cassava and maize were the most cultivated crops, followed by rice. Maize and rice are the most vulnerable during the heading stage. The most <b>usable</b> <b>part</b> of cassava (tubers) was attacked less often.

A special interest was to investigate a possible combine effect of these nutritional components. The diets used contained three forms of vitamin C (crystallized ascorbic acid, encapsulated L-ascorbic acid and Ca-L-threonate) (100 mg/kg) with and without the combination of soybean lecithin. Besides control diet (K), one more diet was supplemented with soybean lecithin (L) only. One-hundred-ninety-two brown bullhead of about 45 g initial body weight was randomly divided in 24 tanks (115 L each). Testing conditions included 8 fish per tank, with triplicate tanks for treatment. All diets with supplemented components had higher final weight. Specific growth rate, feed conversion rate and condition factor were significantly higher with encapsulated vitamin C diets (CC, CC L), followed {{by the results of}} enriched ascorbic acid diets. Vitamin C and lecithin supplementation showed positive influence on significantly higher number of erythrocytes, haematocrit, triglycerides and total protein.

The final version {{is available from the}} American Society of Civil Engineers via [URL] the pavement condition is essential for efficiently deciding on maintenance programs. Current practice is predominantly manual with only 0. 4 % of inspections happening automatically. All methods in the literature aiming at automating condition assessment focus on two defects at most, or are too expensive for practical application. In this paper, the authors propose a low-cost method that automatically detects pavement defects simultaneously using parking camera video data. The types of defects addressed in this paper are two types of cracks (longitudinal and transverse), patches, and potholes. The method uses the semantic texton forests (STFs) algorithm as a supervised classifier on a calibrated region of interest (myROI), which is the area of the video frame depicting only the <b>usable</b> <b>part</b> of the pavement lane. It is validated using data collected from the local streets of Cambridge, U. K. Based on the results of multiple experiments, the overall accuracy of the method is above 82 %, with a precision of more than 91 % for longitudinal cracks, more than 81 % for transverse cracks, more than 88 % for patches, and more than 76 % for potholes. The duration for training and classifying spans from 25 to 150 min, depending on the number of video frames used for each experiment. The contribution of this paper is dual: (1) an automated method for detecting several pavement defects at the same time, and (2) a method for calculating the region of interest within a video frame considering pavement manual guidelines.
