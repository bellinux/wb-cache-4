The main difficulty in teleoperation is the large stochastic time delay between operator and telerobot. Previous works on space teleoperation mainly focus on the control design, and some researches also give good solutions {{to the prediction of}} net work time delay, but few has been put forward to give a sufficient analysis and precise prediction for time delay in space situation. This paper conducts a study upon the time delay measure, model and prediction for space teleoperation. Time delays produced by different nodes of the space-ground round trip are measured and analyzed using statistical methods. And probability density distribution models are proposed and verified by parameter Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and χ 2 Goodness of Fit Principle Test (GFT).

A Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) resource allocation technique offers the opportunity of a detailed link adaptation scheme. The combination of these transmission- and multiple access techniques in OFDM-FDMA is an ideal and very strong candidate for the downlink of future 4 G mobile communication systems. This technical combination offers high cell capacities by exploiting the inherent multi user diversity effect of the system. To apply OFDM-FDMA in the <b>uplink,</b> the <b>time</b> and carrier synchronization accuracy becomes very important. Non-ideal synchronization of the user signals to the carrier frequency of the base station leads to intercarrier interferences (ICI).

40|$|One {{goal in the}} {{development}} of future cellular systems is to increase performance. Channel dependent scheduling can possibly contribute to a performance enhancement. It requires channel qualityinformation and uplink channel knowledge is often incomplete. This master thesis work compares channel dependent scheduling and channel independent scheduling for a Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access-based <b>uplink</b> in <b>time</b> domain and time and frequencydomain assuming continuous channel quality information updates. It also evaluates different methods for providing channel quality information by investigating how the limited channel knowledge they supply affects the performance of channel dependent scheduling. Single-cell simulations with perfect channel knowledge indicate small gains for channel dependent scheduling. Large gains are seen when performing frequency and time domain scheduling instead of only time domain scheduling. Limited channel knowledge causes performance loss for channel dependent scheduling. The performance is only slightly decreased if a method with sufficiently frequent providing of channel quality information updates is applied. More realistic multi-cell simulations show large gains for channel dependent scheduling. It is possible that these results are influenced by link adaptation and scheduling problems due to non predictable interference when performing dynamic scheduling. In the comparison between channel dependent and channel independent scheduling the channel dependent scheduling can benefit {{from the fact that the}} selected channel dependent scheduling algorithms result in a more static scheduling than the selected channel independent scheduling algorithms do...|$|R
