500|$|The initial Montreal {{structure}} of the band began to dissolve {{in the summer of}} 2002, when they travelled to Butler's family farm on Mount Desert Island, Maine to record their self-titled EP. Tension between Butler and bassist Myles Broscoe led the latter to exit the band following the recording session. Richard Reed Parry, who had been enlisted to help the band record, began to collaborate with them during the sessions and would go on to join the band shortly afterwards. Around the same time, Joshua Deu left the band to resume his studies; he continued to collaborate on the visual aspects of the band. In the winter of 2003, the band celebrated the release of its EP with a show at Montreal's Casa del Popolo. Before a crowd packed beyond capacity, the band's set ended (in the middle of an encore) with an argument between Butler and Reed, who quit the band on-stage. Mills told gathered friends in the crowd immediately thereafter that he considered the band to have broken up, as such resigning from the band as well. Following the on-stage implosion, Butler's brother William Butler (subject of the early Arcade Fire song [...] "William Pierce Butler") and Tim Kingsbury were brought in to replace Reed and Mills so that the band could continue, and they set out to promote the self-titled EP. The eponymous release (often referred to by fans as the <b>Us</b> <b>Kids</b> Know EP) was sold at early shows. After the band achieved fame, the EP was subsequently remastered and given a full release.|$|E

[...] Kiplinger's Personal Finance noted that several of the kids they playtested with became stumped in the hieroglyphics portion of the game, with one child exclaiming [...] "sometimes you don't get enough clues". <b>US</b> <b>Kids</b> thought students could go to the Carmen Sandiego website to [...] "find history articles from Britannica Online for more in-depth learning" [...] into the time periods they experienced.|$|E

2500|$|Brodsky’s third book, The Inside Story, {{began as}} an off-hand comment from a friend. Brodsky asked if her friend would like Brodsky to mail some letters for her, and the friend responded, [...] "they'll be very happy." [...] This led Brodsky to imagine happy letters, excited to go where they are going. Rebecca Rule writes in her review {{that it is a}} story [...] "about what happens on those {{occasions}} (rare these days, it seems) when one writes and mails a personal letter, told {{from the point of view}} of an envelope." [...] This gave Brodsky an opportunity to broach the idea of change and how children can best understand and cope with it. Brodsky explains: [...] "Even though the story is an adventure about recycling and the mail system, I think the main theme is about change. Change is difficult for all of <b>us.</b> <b>Kids</b> often deal with change -- in school, in their families, in their neighborhoods." [...] For its discussion of recycling, the book received a national citation from the Green Book Festival in San Francisco.|$|E
2500|$|The Daily Gazettes Susan Reimer {{felt that}} the Madeline {{educational}} games helped to revive girls' interest in computers and changed their preconceptions of them as [...] "that solitary, isolating experience". Reimer wrote the games are: [...] "based {{on the idea that}} girls learn, play and relate to each other in a different way than boys." [...] A writer from The Beacon News thought the series resonated with girls because the main character is a young girl. The writer followed up by noting the difficulty in finding software suited for girls. Mark Ivey and Elizabeth Kemper from Daily News thought the series was an example of how software developers were making strides toward creating quality girls' software that matched what had been created for boys. [...] James Madge of The Toronto Star said the games were [...] "edutainment... geared at girls", and Selling to Kids wrote that through their Madeline series Creative Wonders was [...] "targeting girls" [...] and [...] "get girls thinking." [...] Meanwhile, J.P. Faber of <b>U.S.</b> <b>Kids</b> praised the fact that a [...] "smart little girl is the star", noting that [...] "it's usually a boy who is in charge." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1969 Burton {{enjoyed a}} {{commercial}} blockbuster with Clint Eastwood in the World War II action film Where Eagles Dare; {{he received a}} $1million fee plus {{a share of the}} film's box office gross. According to his daughter Kate Burton, “He did that one for <b>us</b> <b>kids,</b> because we kept asking him, 'Can you do a fun movie that we can go see?" [...] Eastwood [...] thought the script [...] "terrible" [...] and was [...] "all exposition and complications". He asked the film's producer Elliott Kastner and its screenwriter Alistair MacLean to be given less dialogue, later remarking [...] "I just stood around firing my machine gun while Burton handled the dialogue." [...] Burton enjoyed working with Eastwood and said of the picture that he [...] "did all the talking and [...] did all the killing". Burton's last film of the decade, Anne of the Thousand Days (1969) for which he was paid $1.25million, was commercially successful but garnered mixed opinions from reviewers. Noted British film critic Tom Milne of Time Out magazine believed that Burton [...] "plays throughout on a monotonous note of bluff ferocity". Conversely, Vincent Canby of The New York Times appreciated Burton's portrayal of the English monarch, noting that he [...] "is in excellent form and voice—funny, loutish and sometimes wise". Anne of the Thousand Days received ten nominations at the 42nd Academy Awards, including one for Burton's performance as Henry VIII of England, which many thought to be largely the result of an expensive advertising campaign by Universal Studios. The same year, Staircase in which he and his [...] "Cleopatra" [...] co-star Rex Harrison appeared as a bickering homosexual couple, received negative reviews and was unsuccessful.|$|E
