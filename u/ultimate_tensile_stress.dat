A strong temperature dependence was found, with maximum shear bandsliding distance at 150 K. The sliding distance was also found to increasewith lowered strain rates. The temperature dependence is likely to stemfrom increased heat dissipation suppressing a decrease in viscosity, while thestrain rate dependence stems from a decrease in energy supply rate.

40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} the {{polyvinyl}} alcohol (PVA) concentration on mechanical properties of hydrogels based on blends of native or denatured collagen / PVA were examined. Blends of PVA with collagen were obtained by mixing the solutions in different ratios, using glycerol as a plasticizer.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a new method that can simultaneously improve {{the strength and}} toughness of the glass fiber-reinforced bismaleimide–triazine (BT) resin composites by using polyethylene glycol (PEG) to construct a flexible bridge at the interface. The mechanical properties, including the elongation, <b>ultimate</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>stress,</b> Young's modulus, toughness and dynamical mechanical properties were studied {{as a function of}} the length of PEG molecular chain. It was found that the PEG molecule acts as a bridge to link BT resin and glass fiber through covalent and non-covalent bondings, respectively, resulting in improved interfacial bonding. The incorporation of PEG produces an increase in elongation, <b>ultimate</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> and toughness. The Young's modulus and Tg were slightly reduced when the length of the PEG molecular chain was high.

However, the machining of composite materials using cutting tools leads to high temperatures and machined surface damage that {{will tend to}} reduce their mechanical performances. This study presents {{an investigation of the}} influence of cutting parameters on the damage level and mechanical response of off-axis glass/epoxy unidirectional coupons machined by side milling. The analysis of cut surface roughness and micrographic observations reveals the primary importance of the relative orientation of the fibres with respect to the cutting direction. An analysis based on design of experiments underlines the influence of the cutting parameters and cutting edge geometry on the <b>ultimate</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>stresses</b> of the off-axis coupons.

The tensile and compression testing showed high values of <b>ultimate</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>stresses</b> (UTS) and compressive peak stresses, {{both of which}} were above 300.

The creep experiments suggested that in the applied stress range of 30 - 120. MPa the dominant secondary creep deformation mechanism was dislocation climb. The dense distribution of precipitating prismatic particles in the matrix of the magnesium solid solution aided the creep resistance. In the lower-temperature and lower-applied stress creep regime (e. g. longer creep life), intensive creep cavitation was observed at the grain boundaries in the form of cavitated grain facets and a high fraction of cavitated boundaries (∼ 45 %). In the higher-temperature and higher-stress creep regime, failure occurred in the form of mixed grain boundary cavitation and cracking.

TEM and circular dichroism analysis indicated a massive loss of triple-helical collagen from an electrospun collagen (EC) matrix, and the random coils {{were similar to those}} found in gelatin. Nevertheless, from mechanical testing we found the Young’s modulus and <b>ultimate</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>stresses</b> of EC matrices were significantly higher than electrospun gelatin (EG) matrices because matrix stiffness can affect many cell behaviors such as cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation.

40|$|Increased welding speeds {{have reduced}} the heat input in the parent metal, thus {{reducing}} {{the width of the}} heat-affected zone. The present CSA Standard CAN 3 -S 157 -M 83 2 ̆ 2 Strength Design in Aluminum 2 ̆ 2, requires that the zone affected by a weld be taken to extend a distance of 25 mm each side from the centre of the weld. The objective of this experimental investigation was to determine the width of the heat-affected zone and the strength of the metal across the heat-affected zone adjacent to the weld. Ninety-four specimens, parent and welded metal, were tensile tested, 33 specimen bars and plates were hardness tested and 46 cantilevered assemblies were flexure tested. The <b>ultimate</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>stresses</b> and the hardness numbers from the testing results were used to determine the width and strength of the heat-affected zone. This investigation has determined that the width of the heat-affected zone for a given weld size, alloy, welding procedure and heat input decreases with the increase in the plate thickness. Also, the average strength of the metal in the heat-affected zone was found to be higher than the CSA Standard requirements. Based on this investigation, it is concluded that a 6351 -T 6 aluminum alloy welded using an automatic welding operation, with a low and uniform heat input and {{with the use of a}} properly designed welding procedure, the width of the heat-affected zone can be reduced and the average strength of the metal in the heat-affected zone increased.
