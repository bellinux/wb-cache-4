Major General John Numbi, former Air Force chief, now inspector general of police, ran a parallel chain of command in the east to direct the 2009 Eastern Congo offensive, Operation <b>Umoja</b> Wetu; the regular chain of command was by-passed. Previously Numbi negotiated the agreement {{to carry out the}} mixage process with Laurent Nkunda. Commenting on a proposed vote of no confidence in the Minister of Defence in September 2012, Baoudin Amba Wetshi of lecongolais.cd described Ntolo as a 'scapegoat'. Wetshi said that all key military and security questions were handled in total secrecy by the President and other civil and military personalities trusted by him, such as John Numbi, Gabriel Amisi Kumba ('Tango Four'), Delphin Kahimbi, and others such as Kalev Mutond and Pierre Lumbi Okongo.|$|E

2500|$|In {{reaction}} to the apparently growing influence of the Banyamulenge, the majority ethnicities, particularly the Nande and Hunde of North Kivu, focused on dominating the 1977 legislative elections. [...] Once accomplished, they passed the 1981 Citizenship Bill, stating that only people who could prove descent from someone resident in Congo in 1885 would qualify for citizenship. [...] From {{the perspective of the}} [...] "indigenous" [...] ethnicities, such as the Bafuliro, the name [...] "Banyamulenge" [...] was thus a claim to indigeneity in Mulenge, of which the Bafuliro themselves claimed [...] "ownership". [...] However, the bill proved difficult to implement {{by the time of the}} 1985 provincial assembly elections, so the [...] "indigenous" [...] Kivutian majority came up with an ad hoc measure: Banyarwanda were allowed vote in elections but not run for political office. [...] This appeared to aggravate the situation as those Banyarwanda who actually qualified as citizens under the 1981 law found their political rights curtailed. [...] The response of some Banyarwanda, particularly Tutsi, was to smash ballot boxes in protest. Others formed <b>Umoja,</b> an organisation of all Congolese Banyarwanda. [...] However, the increasingly tensions within the Banyarwanda led to the division of the organisation into two Tutsi and Hutu groups in 1988.|$|E
