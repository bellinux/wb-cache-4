5|$|Although {{it always}} had {{hundreds}} of competitors, Standard Oil gradually gained dominance of oil refining and sales as market share in the United States through horizontal integration, ending up with about 90% of the US market. In the kerosene industry, the company replaced the old distribution system with its own vertical system. It supplied kerosene by tank cars that brought the fuel to local markets, and tank wagons then delivered to retail customers, thus bypassing the existing network of wholesale jobbers. Despite improving the quality and availability of kerosene products while greatly reducing their cost to the public (the price of kerosene dropped by nearly 80% {{over the life of}} the company), Standard Oil's business practices created intense controversy. Standard's most potent weapons against competitors were <b>underselling,</b> differential pricing, and secret transportation rebates.|$|E
5|$|Huntsman's {{process was}} only made {{obsolete}} in 1856 by Henry Bessemer's {{invention of the}} Bessemer converter, but production of crucible steel continued {{until well into the}} 20th century for special uses, as Bessemer's steel was not of the same quality, in the main replacing wrought iron for such applications as rails. Bessemer had tried to induce steelmakers to take up his improved system, but met with general rebuffs, and finally was driven to undertake the exploitation of the process himself. To this end he erected steelworks in Sheffield. Gradually the scale of production was enlarged until the competition became effective, and steel traders generally became aware that the firm of Henry Bessemer & Co. was <b>underselling</b> them to the extent of £20 a ton. One of Bessemer's converters can still be seen at Sheffield's Kelham Island Museum.|$|E
25|$|Safe in Sound is {{the fifth}} studio album by British rock band Lower Than Atlantis. Following the release of Changing Tune (2012), Island Records were {{streamlining}} and dropping artists who were <b>underselling.</b> Despite the album <b>underselling,</b> the group couldn't be dropped as the label had picked the option for their next album. The label offered the band the chance to take an advance and leave, which they subsequently did to build a personal studio. Here, the group worked on their next album, Lower Than Atlantis, which was released through Sony Music and supported by successful tours. In early 2015, the band were having discussions with Sony about their next album.|$|E

25|$|Lower Than Atlantis {{released}} {{their third}} album Changing Tune in October 2012 through Island Records. Sometime afterwards, the label {{was in the}} process of streamlining and dropping artists that were <b>underselling.</b> Despite the album reaching the top 30, it undersold the label's expectations. The band, however, couldn't be dropped due to the label having already picked the option for their next album. The label gave the band the choice to either release the next album through them but with no marketing, or take an advance and leave the label. The band subsequently took the advance and built their own recording studio. The band spent the following couple of years working on the studio and their next album.|$|E

Savile Row tailors argue that [...] "bespoke", in relation to tailoring, is understood to mean a suit cut and made by hand; however, after a ruling by the Advertising Standards Authority in 2008, the term may now also be applied to machine sewed garments, provided they are made-to-measure. Suits, at Kilgour & French, cost at least £5000. The Creative Director Carlo Brandelli makes no apologies for the cost.

[...] 2006's A Change is Gonna Come also cites the album as important in neo soul, including it along with R.

The firm was attacked by journalists and politicians throughout its existence, in part for these monopolistic methods, giving momentum to the antitrust movement. By 1880, according to the New York World, Standard Oil was [...] "the most cruel, impudent, pitiless, and grasping monopoly that ever fastened upon a country."

2500|$|Very differently, {{classical}} economists see in Smith's first sentences his programme {{to promote}} [...] "The Wealth of Nations". Using the physiocratical {{concept of the}} economy as a circular process, to secure growth the inputs of Period 2 must exceed the inputs of Period 1. Therefore, those outputs of Period 1 which are not used or usable as inputs of Period 2 are regarded as unproductive labour, as they do not contribute to growth. This is what Smith had heard in France from, among others, Quesnay. To this French insight that unproductive labour should be reduced to use labour more productively, Smith added his own proposal, that productive labour should be made even more productive by deepening the division of labour. Smith argued that deepening the division of labour under competition leads to greater productivity, which leads to lower prices and thus an increasing standard of living—"general plenty" [...] and [...] "universal opulence"—for all. Extended markets and increased production lead to the continuous reorganisation of production and the invention of new ways of producing, which in turn lead to further increased production, lower prices, and improved standards of living. Smith's central message is therefore that under dynamic competition a growth machine secures [...] "The Wealth of Nations". Smith's argument predicted Britain's evolution as the workshop of the world, <b>underselling</b> and outproducing all its competitors. The opening sentences of the [...] "Wealth of Nations" [...] summarise this policy: ...|$|E
