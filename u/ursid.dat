40|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{history of the}} red panda (Ailurus fulgens) plays {{a pivotal role in}} the higher-level phylogeny of the “bear-like ” arctoid carnivoran mammals. Characters from morphology and molecules have provided inconsistent evidence for placement of the red panda. Whereas it certainly is an arctoid, there has been major controversy about whether it should be placed with the bears (<b>ursids),</b> <b>ursids</b> plus pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, walrus), raccoons (procyonids), musteloids (raccoons plus weasels, skunks, otters, and badgers [mustelids]), or as a monotypic lineage of uncertain phylogenetic affinities.

50|$|The <b>Ursids</b> (URS) meteor {{activity}} begins annually around December 17 {{and runs}} {{for a week}} plus, until the 25th or 26th. This meteor shower is named for its radiant point which is located near the star Beta Ursae Minoris (Kochab) in the constellation Ursa Minor.|$|R
40|$|Within {{the order}} Carnivora, the {{phylogeny}} {{of the red}} panda (Ailurus fulgens) is contentious, with morphological and molecular studies supporting {{a wide range of}} possible relationships, including close ties to procyonids, <b>ursids,</b> mustelids and mephitids. This study provides additional morphological data, including muscle maps, for the forelimb of Ailurus, based on the dissection of four cadavers from the National Zoological Park, Washington, DC, USA. The red panda forelimb is characterized by a number of primitive features, including the lack of m. rhomboideus profundus, a humeral insertion for m. cleidobrachialis, the presence of mm. brachioradialis, articularis humeri and coracobrachialis, a single muscle belly for m. extensor digitorum lateralis with tendons to digits III–V, four mm. lumbricales, and the presence of mm. flexor digitorum brevis manus, adductores digiti I, II and V, and abductor digiti I and V. Red pandas resemble Ailuropoda, mustelids and some procyonids in possessing a soft tissue origin of m. flexor digitorum superficialis. In addition, red pandas are similar to <b>ursids</b> and procyonids in having a variable presence of m. biceps brachii caput breve. Furthermore, Ailurus and some <b>ursids</b> lack m. rhomboideus capitis. The forelimb muscle maps from this study represent a valuable resource for analyzing the functional anatomy of fossil ailurids and some notes on the Miocene ailurid, Simocyon batalleri, are presented...|$|R

5000|$|A small, lens-shaped radial sesamoid {{embedded}} {{into the}} APL tendon is a primitive state {{found in all}} known Carnivora genera except in the red and giant pandas and the extinct Simocyon where it is hypertrophied (enlarged) into a sixth digit or a so called [...] "false thumb", a derived trait that first appeared in <b>ursids.</b> [...] The APL sesamoid is present in all non-human primates, but only in about half of gorillas, and normally absent in humans.|$|R
50|$|Another {{possible}} {{cause of the}} cat gap {{could have been the}} late Cenozoic ice age that began approximately 30 million years ago. This ice age caused glaciation in Antarctica that eventually spread to Arctic regions of southern Alaska, Greenland, and Iceland. Glaciers on the North American continent, as well as the cooling trend, could have made the ecosystem uninhabitable for feliformia cat-like species, although habitable for cold-weather caniformia species such as canids (dog-like species), mustelids (weasel-like species), and <b>ursids</b> (bear-like species).|$|R

50|$|The {{brown bear}} (Ursus arctos) {{is a large}} bear with the widest {{distribution}} of any living <b>ursid.</b> The species is distributed across much of northern Eurasia and North America. It {{is one of the}} two largest terrestrial carnivorans alive today, rivaled in body size only by its close cousin, the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), which is much less variable in size and averages larger due to this. There are several recognized subspecies, many of which are quite well-known within their native ranges, found in the brown bear species.|$|E
50|$|An <b>ursid</b> hybrid is {{an animal}} with parents from two {{different}} species or subspecies of the Ursidae (bear) family. Species and subspecies of bear known to have produced offspring with another bear species or subspecies include brown bears, black bears, grizzly bears and polar bears, {{all of which are}} members of the Ursus genus. Bears not included in Ursus, such as the giant panda, are probably unable to produce hybrids. Note all of the confirmed hybrids listed here have been in captivity (except grizzly/polar bear), but there have been hybrids in the wild.|$|E
25|$|For many decades, {{the precise}} taxonomic {{classification}} {{of the giant}} panda was under debate because it shares characteristics with both bears and raccoons. However, molecular studies indicate the giant panda is a true bear, {{part of the family}} Ursidae. These studies show it differentiated early (about 19 million years ago) from the main ursine stock; since it is the most basal member of the group, it is equidistant from all other extant <b>ursids.</b> The giant panda has been referred to as a living fossil.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} for {{the first}} time the radial sesamoid or “false thumb” of the spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), showing its great morphological similarities with that of the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) and the differences with that of the rest of the Ursidae. This points to the existence of a common origin for this structure in both species, but considering the accepted phylogenies of <b>ursids,</b> the sharing of a “false thumb” in T. ornatus and A. melanoleuca would be a plesiomorphy for these groups, whereas in the rest of the <b>ursids</b> the radial sesamoid was probably reduced, lacking the specialised function that this bone has in Tremarctinae and Ailuropodinae. Se describe por primera vez el sesamoideo radial o “falso pulgar” del oso de anteojos (Tremarctos ornatus), mostrando la gran similitud morfológica con el del panda gigante (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) y las diferencias que presenta con el resto de los Ursidae. Esto apunta a la existencia de un origen común para esta estructura en ambas especies, pero considerando las filogenias aceptadas de Ursidae, la presencia de falso pulgar en T. ornatus y A. melanoleuca sería una simplesiomorfía respecto al resto de úrsidos, en los cuales el sesamoideo radial nunca aumentó de tamaño, careciendo de la especializada función que posee en Tremarctinae y Ailuropodinae...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Ursids</b> were {{probably}} discovered by William F. Denning who observed them {{for several years}} around {{the start of the}} 20th century. While there were sporadic observations after, the first coordinated studies of shower didn't begin until Dr. A. Bečvář observed an outburst of 169 per hour in 1945. Further observations in the 1970s and ongoing to current have established a relationship with comet 8P/Tuttle. Peter Jenniskens and Esko Lyytinen discovered that outbursts could happen when comet Tuttle was at aphelion because some meteorids get trapped in the 7/6 orbital resonance with Jupiter.|$|R
5000|$|A grizzly-polar bear hybrid (known as a pizzly bear or grolar bear) {{is a rare}} <b>ursid</b> hybrid {{resulting}} from a union of a brown bear and a polar bear. It has occurred both in captivity and in the wild. In 2006, the occurrence of this hybrid in nature was confirmed by testing the DNA of a strange-looking bear that {{had been shot in}} the Canadian arctic. Previously, the hybrid had been produced in zoos, and was considered a [...] "cryptid" [...] (a hypothesized animal for which there is no scientific proof of existence in the wild).|$|E
5000|$|Ursavus is an extinct genus of <b>ursid</b> carnivoran mammals {{that existed}} in North America, Europe, and Asia during the Miocene, living from about 23—5.3 million years ago (Mya), {{existing}} for roughly [...] [...] The genus apparently dispersed from Asia into North America about 20 Mya, becoming the earliest member of the subfamily Ursinae in the New World. Qiu points out that if a questionable 29-million-year-old specimen of Ursavus reported in North America is validated, Ursavus may have evolved in North America and dispersed westward into Asia. The higher number of fossils in Europe grading toward eastern Asia make the westward dispersal unlikely.|$|E
5000|$|Parictis is the {{earliest}} genus of bears known. [...] It {{was a very}} small and graceful <b>ursid</b> with a skull only 7 cm long.

[...] Some suggest that Parictis may have emigrated from Asia into North America during the major sea level low about 37 mya, because of the continued evolution of the Amphicynodontinae into the Hemicyoninae in Asia. Although no Parictis fossils have been found in East Asia, Parictis does appear in Eurasia and Africa, but not until the Miocene.|$|E
