50|$|People with Emanuel {{syndrome}} typically {{inherit the}} der(22) chromosome from an unaffected parent. The parent carries a chromosomal rearrangement between chromosomes 11 and 22 called a balanced translocation. No genetic material is gained or {{lost in a}} balanced translocation, so these chromosomal changes usually do not cause any health problems. As this translocation is passed to the next generation, it can become unbalanced. Individuals with Emanuel syndrome inherit an <b>unbalanced</b> <b>translocation</b> between chromosomes 11 and 22 {{in the form of}} a der(22) chromosome. These individuals have two normal copies of chromosome 11, two normal copies of chromosome 22, and extra genetic material from the der(22) chromosome. As a result of the extra chromosome, people with Emanuel syndrome have three copies of some genes in each cell instead of the usual two copies. The excess genetic material disrupts the normal course of development, leading to intellectual disability and birth defects.

40|$|Background: There {{are only}} three cases of <b>unbalanced</b> <b>translocation</b> (X; 1) {{reported}} in childhood in the literature, while no such phenotypic information is available in adults. Materials and methods: To delineate the phenotype-genotype relationship of <b>unbalanced</b> <b>translocation</b> (X; 1) in adulthood, we reported here a 20 -year-old female with an <b>unbalanced</b> <b>translocation</b> (X; 1) which was determined by spectral karyotyping, array-comparative genomic hybridization and subtelomeric {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH). Results: The phenotype of partial trisomy 1 and partial monosomy X of the present case was much attenuated, including premature ovarian failure, mental retardation, class I obesity, mild dysmorphism and delayed secondary sexual characteristics. The breakpoints of the <b>unbalanced</b> <b>translocation</b> were accurately located at Xq 28 and 1 q 32 · 1. The large amplification on Chromosome 1 q arm was found to involve 312 genes and the deletion on Chromosome X q arm also involved 141 genes. Overall, genes associated with physiological process (47 genes), cellular process (33), development (23), response to stimulus (1) and reproduction (1) were observed in the amplification on chromosome 1 q arm. In addition, genes related to physiological process (23 genes), cellular process (13), development (6) and response to stimulus (2) were observed in the large deletion on chromosome X q arm. Late-replication studies revealed the existence of skewed X inactivation in the derivative X chromosome. Conclusions: The phenotype of partial monosomy X and partial trisomy 1 q is much attenuated in case of <b>unbalanced</b> <b>translocation</b> (X; 1) in adulthood probably owing to skewed X inactivation in derivative X chromosome...|$|E
