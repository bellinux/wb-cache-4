5|$|At {{the railway}} station in Belgrade, Bond passes on word of Kerim Bey's death {{to one of}} his sons, and asks for an agent from Station Y to meet him at Zagreb. However, when the train arrives at the station, Grant {{intercepts}} Nash, sent from Station Y, killing the agent before posing as him. After drugging Romanova at dinner, Grant overpowers Bond before taunting him about SPECTRE's involvement in the theft. After disclosing that Romanova was <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was truly going on, believing she was working for Russia, Grant reveals to Bond his plans to leave behind the film SPECTRE took of him and Romanova at the hotel, along with a forged blackmail letter, to make it appear that their deaths were the result of a murder-suicide, to scandalise the British intelligence community. Bond quickly convinces him to accept a bribe of gold sovereigns in exchange for a final cigarette, tricking Grant into setting off the booby trap in his attaché case. This distracts Grant enough for Bond to attack him in brutal hand-to-hand combat. In the ensuing fight, Bond narrowly gains the upper hand, stabbing Grant with the case's concealed knife before strangling him with his own garrotte. Bond then drags the comatose Romanova from the train (which has been stopped by a SPECTRE accomplice), where he hijacks Grant's getaway truck and flees the scene with Romanova.|$|E
5|$|On 31 October 1517, Luther sent {{a letter}} to Archbishop of Mainz, Albert of Brandenburg, under whose {{authority}} the indulgences were being sold. In the letter, Luther addresses the archbishop out of a loyal desire to alert him to the pastoral problems created by the indulgence sermons. He assumes that Albert is <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is being preached under his authority, and speaks out of concern that the people are being led away from the gospel, and that the indulgence preaching may bring shame to Albert's name. Luther does not condemn indulgences or the current doctrine regarding them, nor even the sermons which had been preached themselves, as he had not seen them firsthand. Instead he states his concern regarding the misunderstandings of the people about indulgences which have been fostered by the preaching, such as the belief that any sin could be forgiven by indulgences or that the guilt as well as the punishment for sin could be forgiven by an indulgence. In a postscript, Luther wrote that Albert could find some theses on the matter enclosed with his letter, so that he could see the uncertainty surrounding the doctrine of indulgences in contrast to the preachers who spoke so confidently of the benefits of indulgences.|$|E

She remains unconscious, until Rachel Kinski (Caitlin Stasey) visits and pleads with her to wake up. Bridget's hand moves and she awakes the next day. However, she cannot feel anything down the left side of her body and she is told that she could be permanently disabled. Susan realises that she caused the accident and comes forward. She is arrested and put on trial. Bridget remembers that she fell into the road and that the accident was not Susan's fault, and she tells the court.

40|$|In {{this paper}} and its {{companion}} paper, Board & Chung [4], we provide foundations for {{a model of}} unawareness {{that can be used}} to distinguish between what an agent is <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> and <b>what</b> she simply does not know. At an informal level, this distinction plays a key role in a number of recent papers such as Tirole [27] and Chung & Fortnow [6]. Here we provide a set-theoretic (i. e. non-linguistic) version of our framework. We use our object-based unawareness structures to investigate two applications. The first application provides a justification for the contra proferentem doctrine of contract interpretation, under which ambiguous terms in a contract are construed against the drafter. Our second application examines speculative trade. We first generalize the classical No Trade Theorem to situations where agents are delusional but nevertheless satisfy a weaker condition called terminal partitionality. We then introduce the concepts of living in denial (i. e., agents believe, perhaps incorrectly, that there is nothing that they are <b>unaware</b> <b>of)</b> and living in paranoia (i. e., agents believe, perhaps incorrectly, that there is something that they are <b>unaware</b> <b>of).</b> We show that both living in denial and living in paranoid, in the absence of other forms of delusion, imply terminal partitionality, and hence the no-trade theorem result obtains. This paper replaces an earlier working paper titled “Object-Based Unawareness II: Applications”. Our companion paper, Board & Chung [4], replaces an earlier working paper titled “Object-Based Unawareness”...|$|R

Brian begins misinterpreting Anna's words and actions (some of which are subtle signals to Jake as their affair is kept under wraps) and even has an erotic dream about her; he begins to seriously consider quitting the priesthood to pursue a romantic relationship with her. Anna tells Jake that she wants things to be more serious between them {{and he does not}} respond well. While the three have dinner one night with Jake's mother Ruth, Ruth has a private conversation with Anna, where she tearfully reveals that she knows about Anna and Jake's secret relationship. Jake and Brian walk in on the ladies having a tearful moment, and later Jake and Anna have an argument over the religious issues complicating their romance, which ends in the two parting ways in frustration. Anna calls Brian for comfort and he rushes over to her apartment. Still <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> been going on, he takes her tearful ramblings to be a confession of feelings for him, then kisses her and admits his love. When she interrupts him, he first assumes it to be guilt based on his vows, but she tells him she is in love with Jake and finally admits that she and Jake have been seeing each other secretly for months. Feeling embarrassed and rejected, Brian raids Anna's liquor cabinet, angrily cutting off her attempts to re-assure him and apologize. He leaves and spends the whole night out drinking on the streets.
