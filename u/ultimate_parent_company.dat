40|$|Abstract This paper {{examines}} the substitution pattern between <b>parent</b> <b>company</b> and foreign affiliate employment of European multinationals. The data {{is drawn from}} the AMADEUS and BANKSCOPE firm-level databases and covers <b>parent</b> <b>companies</b> in 14 high-wage European countries (EUR 14) and their affiliated com-panies in the wider Europe including locations in the low-wage Central and East European countries (CEEC) for the period 2000 – 2004. We find that the substitution elasticity between employment of the EUR 14 <b>parent</b> <b>companies</b> and employment in their foreign affiliates in the CEEC is quite low. Furthermore, the substitution possibilities are higher between <b>parent</b> <b>company</b> and affiliate employment in other West European countries than those between <b>parent</b> <b>company</b> and affiliate employment in the CEEC. Finally, {{we find that the}} output change of the <b>parent</b> <b>company</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} that of the foreign affiliates is more important than changes in relative wages in determining the relative labour demand...|$|R

5000|$|A Reverse Morris Trust is {{used when}} a <b>parent</b> <b>company</b> has a {{subsidiary}} (sub-company) {{that it wants}} to sell in a tax-efficient manner. The <b>parent</b> <b>company</b> completes a spin-off of a subsidiary to the <b>parent</b> <b>company's</b> shareholders. Under Internal Revenue Code section 355, this could be tax-free if certain criteria are met. The former subsidiary (now owned by the <b>parent</b> <b>company's</b> shareholders, but separate from the <b>parent</b> <b>company)</b> then merges with a target company to create a merged company. Under Internal Revenue Code section 368 (a)(1)(A), this could be largely tax-free if the former subsidiary is considered the [...] "buyer" [...] of the target company. The former subsidiary is the [...] "buyer" [...] if its shareholders (also the original <b>parent</b> <b>company's</b> shareholders) own more than 50% of the merged company. Thus, the former subsidiary will usually have a bigger market capitalization than the target company. The target company's managers rarely run the merged company.|$|R
