40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 9 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Malta, 16 - 18 July, 2012. A major task of designing a {{ground source heat pump}} system (GSHP) is sizing of its ground heat exchanger (GHE; usually a run of straight or coiled or U-shaped pipe buried in the ground vertically or horizontally). The sizing of a GHE and prediction of its performance is complicated by many factors such as: the transient nature of the heat exchange; the accumulative effect and the history of heat exchange; the depth dependency of the <b>ground’s</b> <b>undisturbed</b> temperature and thermal properties, and the presence of ground water.

30|$|Thermal {{response}} test (TRT) is {{a well-known}} experimental procedure allowing to derive in situ fundamental thermal–physical properties of the ground and of the borehole. Since its first developments in the mid- 90 s, it has spread rapidly, being now available in about 40 countries worldwide (Nordell 2011; Spitler and Gehlin 2015). Typically, it consists in forcing a thermal-carrier fluid at constant flow rate in a test borehole and in regulating the fluid inlet temperature in order to inject into the ground (or extract from it) a constant heat rate for 2 – 3  days. By choosing a physical model describing the TRT and by solving the associated inverse heat transfer problem, the average ground thermal conductivity, the borehole thermal resistance, and the <b>ground</b> <b>undisturbed</b> temperature can be assessed. Such parameters are the essential inputs {{for the design of}} ground heat exchangers (Zhang et al. 2014).|$|R

40|$|The <b>undisturbed</b> <b>ground</b> {{temperature}} {{is one of}} the key thermogeological parameters for the assessment and utilization of shallow geothermal resources.

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of porphyrin-substituted nucleosides into tetranucleotides using phosphoramidite chemistry on solid support is reported. Both diphenyl and tetraphenyl porphyrin nucleosides {{were used as}} building blocks. This method allows the synthesis of chiral homo- and heteroporphyrinic arrays, where the composition and thus the physical properties of the array can be modulated simply by reprogramming the DNA synthesizer. The porphyrin arrays are initially isolated in the free-base form. Remetallation to give the zinc-porphyrins can be achieved using standard procedures in solution. The UV-vis spectra of the arrays are reproducible by a superposition of the absorbance spectra of the individual porphyrins, indicating an <b>undisturbed</b> electronic <b>ground</b> state of the porphyrins in the arrays. The {{same is true for}} the steady-state emission spectra of the homoporphyrinic arrays, which are not influenced by the presence of the nucleotide strand. In the mixed porphyrin arrays, large differences in the excited-state properties compared to an equimolar mixture of the building blocks are observed by means that the emission of the diphenyl porphyrin moiety is quenched to a large extent, and the overall emission is dominated by the tetraphenyl porphyrin. The covalent connection of the porphyrins via the DNA-derived backbone therefore substantially alters the excited-state and energy-transfer properties of mixed porphyrin systems. The circular dichroism (CD) spectra show induced negative cotton effects in the region of the porphyrin B-band absorption, which is due to the attachment of the chromophores to the chiral oligonucleotide backbone. Addition of a complementary tetra-adenosine did not alter any of the spectroscopic properties, neither in chloroform nor in acetonitrile solutions. Therefore, it can be concluded that no duplex is formed, which is corroborated by 1 H NMR spectroscop...|$|R

60|$|As doubts {{have been}} {{expressed}} by some writers whether worms ever swallow earth {{solely for the}} sake of making their burrows, some additional cases may be given. A mass of fine reddish sand, 23 inches in thickness, left on the ground for nearly two years, had been penetrated in many places by worms; and their castings consisted partly of the reddish sand and partly of black earth brought up from beneath the mass. This sand had been dug up from a considerable depth, and was of so poor a nature that weeds could not grow on it. It is therefore highly improbable that it should have been swallowed by the worms as food. Again in a field near my house the castings frequently consist of almost pure chalk, which lies at only a little depth beneath the surface; and here again it is very improbable that the chalk should have been swallowed {{for the sake of}} the very little organic matter which could have percolated into it from the poor overlying pasture. Lastly, a casting thrown up through the concrete and decayed mortar between the tiles, with which the now ruined aisle of Beaulieu Abbey had formerly been paved, was washed, so that the coarser matter alone was left. This consisted of grains of quartz, micaceous slate, other rocks, and bricks or tiles, many of them from 1/20 to 1/10 inch in diameter. No one will suppose that these grains were swallowed as food, yet they formed more than half of the casting, for they weighed 19 grains, the whole casting having weighed 33 grains. Whenever a worm burrows to a depth of some feet in <b>undisturbed</b> compact <b>ground,</b> it must form its passage by swallowing the earth; for it is incredible that the ground could yield on all sides to the pressure of the pharynx when pushed forwards within the worm's body.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2013 Fungi {{are thought}} {{to be one of the}} most diverse groups of organisms in the Arctic. They drive mineral and energy cycles and {{influence}} the occurrence of other organisms as mutualists (mycorrhizae, endophytes, lichens), decomposers and pathogens. Nevertheless, information on fungal biodiversity and distribution patterns in relation to environments across the Arctic is still sparse. Molecular methods were used to examine the diversity and community structures of ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) associated with two principal arctic host plants, Salix aretica and Dryas integrifolia, as well as total soil fungal communities of adjacent disturbed and undisturbed areas of patterned-ground features across the five bioclimatic subzones (A-E) of the North American Arctic. Key findings include the following: (1) More diverse fungal communities had been observed than previously known. These communities encompass nearly all fungal phyla and included all fungal guilds. However, a few species-rich fungal families dominated these fungal communities. (2) Surprisingly, species richness did not decline with latitude. (3) The most abundant fungal taxa were widely distributed in and beyond the Arctic. Yet root (EMF) and soil fungal communities showed niche preferences in regard to bioclimatic subzones. Furthermore, disturbed and <b>undisturbed</b> patterned <b>ground</b> features harbored different soil fungal communities with the exception of the coldest subzone A. In contrast, EMF community composition was not affected by host plant identity. (4) Fungal communities in the warmest subzone E were distinct from the other arctic subzones and the majority of taxa matched fungi from the boreal forest. (5) Key drivers of fungal community and guild composition along the bioclimatic gradient included regional climate, p. H as well as vegetation composition and productivity across the subzones. At the local scale of patterned-ground features, fungal communities were correlated with vegetation composition and microclimate. With a warming climate, I would expect an enhanced colonization of patterned-ground features by vascular plants that would then affect fungal community structure not only at the species level, but also at the level of fungal guilds. In particular I would expect increases in fungi that are symbiotic with plants and a northward shift of both plant and fungal taxa...|$|R

As there is a well-known parallelism between the oil and gas case and groundwater production wells (Raymond et al. 2011) and as it is clear the parallelism between the geothermal heat exchanger and groundwater production wells, we can therefore find a similarity between the oil and gas tests and the thermal response test. In fact, in both cases, we have a sort of production test, which is, for the former, a well test, while for the latter, the TRT.
