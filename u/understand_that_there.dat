Today, scientists <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are limits to the how small or large a star can be. Objects that are too small lack the internal pressure to initiate thermonuclear fusion, which is what causes a star to shine. These objects are known as brown dwarfs and represent {{the lower end of the}} stellar mass scale. Stars that are too large become unstable and explode in a supernova.|$|E

I <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is speculation, but some day justice {{will be done}} there, too.” Victoria also gave her opinion that happiness is important, and that these days {{it is not so}} much about background and pedigree but about two people who have to live with each other. She said that if they are not happy and comfortable with each other, it is impossible to do a good job.|$|E
25|$|The team {{wanted to}} capture the aspect of BioShock where not every non-player {{character}} would immediately be aggressive towards you; Levine discusses a situation in Infinite where the player character walks into a crowded bar and cannot immediately tell the disposition of the non-player characters towards the player. Levine compared this {{to the introduction of}} the Big Daddy in BioShock, giving the player several opportunities to view but not engage the characters so they would <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are several possible outcomes depending on what approach they used when they did have the ability to engage one. As Infinite contains numerous groups in internal conflict with each other, the player will {{be given the opportunity to}} learn how to utilize different non-player character agents to progress in the game. Irrational wanted to make sure consequences of the player's actions were reflected in the game; part of this is through the strain on Elizabeth when using her powers, but through altering the suspended city, they are able to change the environment in response to the player's choice and force the player to consider different tactics.|$|E

25|$|A {{sense of}} {{complacency}} fell upon {{those in charge}} of developing tanks in the U.S. Army because the M4 Sherman, in 1942, was considered by the Americans to be superior to the most common German tanks: the Panzer III and early models of the Panzer IV. Even through most of 1943, the 75-mm M4 Sherman was adequate against the majority of German armor, although the widespread appearance of the German 7.5 cm KwK 40 tank gun during this time had led to a growing awareness that the M4 was becoming outgunned. There was insufficient Intelligence data processing and forward thinking to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was an ongoing arms race in tanks and that the U.S. needed to anticipate future German tank threats. The Tiger I and Panther tanks that appeared in 1943 were seen in only very limited numbers by U.S. forces and hence were not considered as major threats. The end result was that, in 1943, the Ordnance Department lacking any guidance {{from the rest of}} the army, concentrated its efforts in tank development mainly on its major project, the electrical transmission T23. By contrast, the Russians and British were engaged in a continuous effort to improve tanks; in 1943, the British begin development of what became the 51-ton Centurion tank (although this tank would reach service just too late to see combat in World War II) and, on the Eastern Front, a full-blown tank arms race was underway, with the Soviets responding to the German heavy tanks by starting development work on the T-34-85 and IS-2 tanks.|$|E

Unwillingness to tackle and accusations {{of a lack of}} effort were also the source of Joe Royle's omission of Kinkladze from his Manchester City side.|$|E

During the Western Conference finals, Getzlaf was fined $10,000 for using a homophobic slur to insult an on-ice official.

500|$|During an {{interview}} in 1993, Folkvord said his most important commitment if he gained a seat in parliament was giving the National trade union centers more power {{so that they could}} better defend the working class. When asked if it was exhausting to promote socialist reforms Folkvord said, [...] "It is. But I think in some ways easier than before [...] fake socialist regimes have collapsed". Another opinion of his was that [...] "capitalism destroys the natural environment around us making the bourgeois society planners <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> must be something new in the future. This provides inspiration to win support for socialist beliefs in Norway". Folkvord's first contact with anti-capitalist beliefs came when he joined the Workers' Communist Party. The party told him about [...] "capitalist barbarism" [...] and how the wealthy controlled everything. Folkvord said he believed that [...] " [...] can't be the end of human development", and that he believes humans are destined to create another more-just system.|$|E

2500|$|Van Helmont is {{regarded}} as the founder of pneumatic chemistry, as {{he was the first to}} <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are gases distinct in kind from atmospheric air and furthermore invented the word [...] "gas". He perceived that his [...] "gas sylvestre" [...] (carbon dioxide) given off by burning charcoal, was the same as that produced by fermenting must, which sometimes renders the air of caves unbreathable. For Van Helmont, air and water were the two primitive elements. Fire he explicitly denied to be an element, and earth is not one because it can be reduced to water.|$|E
2500|$|Actually, {{the locus}} classicus, the best {{formulation}} of this, was by an {{ambassador to the}} United Nations, Abba Eban, ... He advised the American Jewish community that they had two tasks to perform. One task was to show that criticism of the policy, what he called anti-Zionism — that means actually criticisms of {{the policy of the}} state of Israel — were anti-Semitism. That’s the first task. Second task, if the criticism was made by Jews, their task was to show that it’s neurotic self-hatred, needs psychiatric treatment. Then he gave two examples of the latter category. One was I.F. Stone. The other was me. So, we have to be treated for our psychiatric disorders, and non-Jews have to be condemned for anti-Semitism, if they’re critical of the state of Israel. That’s understandable why Israeli propaganda would take this position. I don’t particularly blame Abba Eban for doing what ambassadors are sometimes supposed to do. But we ought to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no sensible charge. No sensible charge. There’s nothing to respond to. It’s not a form of anti-Semitism. It’s simply criticism of the criminal actions of a state, period.|$|E

2500|$|Kierkegaard {{addressed}} {{this idea of}} proving God in this discourse. He says, [...] "When one grows older, everything becomes so miserable. God in heaven has to sit {{and wait for the}} decision on his fate, whether he exists, and finally he comes into existence {{with the help of a}} few demonstrations; human beings have to put up with waiting for the matter to be decided. Suppose that a person died before that time; suppose that when the matter was finally decided he was not in the practice of thinking about God as a Creator and the joy over that was all gone!" [...] He also said, [...] "Even though the Preacher ordinarily speaks rigorously to people, he nevertheless is so courteous as to assume that you <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a God is not so vain as to think that he has invented the existence of God. He had already made his decision about Christianity as early as 1835 when he wrote:it is not possible to harvest immediately what one has sown. I will remember that philosopher's method of having his disciples keep silent for three years; then I dare say it will come. Just as one does not begin a feast at sunrise but at sundown, just so in the spiritual world one must work forward for some time before the sun really shines for us and rises in all its glory; for although it is true as it says that God lets his sun shine upon the good and the evil and lets the rain fall on the just and the unjust, it is not so in the spiritual world. So let the die be cast — I am crossing the Rubicon! No doubt this road takes me into battle, but I will not renounce it. I will not lament the past — why lament? I will work energetically and not waste time in regrets, like the person stuck in a bog and first calculating how far he has sunk without recognizing that during the time he spends on that he is sinking still deeper. I will hurry along the path I have found and shout to everyone I meet: Do not look back as Lot's wife did, but remember that we are struggling up a hill.|$|E
