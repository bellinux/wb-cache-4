5|$|Lie and {{his family}} {{returned}} to Buitenzorg in 1866. At the time there were no schools offering a European-style education in the city, and thus {{he was sent to}} a Chinese-run school. For three years, in which the youth studied under three different headmasters, he was made to repeat traditional Hokkien phrases and copy Chinese characters without <b>understanding</b> <b>them.</b> Tio suggests that Lie obtained little knowledge at the school, and until his death Lie was unable to understand Chinese. During his time in Buitenzorg, he studied painting under Raden Saleh, a friend of his father's. Although he reportedly showed skill, he did not continue the hobby as his mother disapproved. He also showed a propensity for traditional literary forms such as pantun (a form of poetry) and was fond of creating his own.|$|E

Open clusters are a crucial step in this sequence.|$|E

The minimal remains from wooden structures are easy to miss and stone buildings may leave foundations, but—as with the great forum—they were often dismantled for stone during the Middle Ages and early modern period.|$|E

25|$|Government can {{be defined}} as the {{political}} means of creating and enforcing laws; typically via a bureaucratic hierarchy. Politics is the process by which decisions are made within groups; this process often involves conflict as well as compromise. Although the term is generally applied to behavior within governments, politics is also observed in all human group interactions, including corporate, academic, and religious institutions. Many different political systems exist, as do many different ways of <b>understanding</b> <b>them,</b> and many definitions overlap. Examples of governments include monarchy, Communist state, military dictatorship, theocracy, and liberal democracy, the last of which is considered dominant today. All of these issues have a direct relationship with economics.|$|E

500|$|Lansdale {{continued}} {{to be critical of}} Durbrow, and wanted to replace him as ambassador. Two months later, the incoming US President John F. Kennedy started a review of Washington's stance with regards to Saigon. Lansdale's report predicted South Vietnam's demise, and along with it, the rest of South East Asia and US preeminence in global affairs, unless a new direction was found. He blamed what he saw as Durbrow's poor judgement for the problems in the alliance, and that the current ambassador could not work effectively anymore because he had [...] "sympathized strongly" [...] with the coup. Without explicitly suggesting himself, Lansdale said that Durbrow had to be replaced with someone [...] "with marked leadership talents" [...] and the ability to [...] "influence Asians through <b>understanding</b> <b>them</b> sympathetically". Lansdale called Diệm [...] "the only Vietnamese with executive ability and the required determination to be an effective President" [...] and said the new ambassador needed thus needed to have a rapport with him. Lansdale said Diệm was comfortable with MAAG and the CIA, but felt that diplomats were [...] "very close to those who tried to kill him on November 11". During the meeting at which these matters were discussed, there was strong agreement that Durbrow's position in Saigon had become untenable. Lansdale's submissions were seen as being important in Kennedy's decision to replace Durbrow with Frederick Nolting in May 1961. Nolting was a mild man who was seen as unlikely to pressure Diệm to reform and therefore upset him. Kennedy was thought to have seriously contemplated the appointment of Lansdale, before encountering complaints from sections of the State and Defense Departments, among them Defense Secretary Robert McNamara. Kennedy also increased funding for Diệm immediately and made a show of support for the Vietnamese leader at the advice of Lansdale.|$|E

500|$|One of Blow's {{goals for}} The Witness {{was to explore}} the types of non-verbal {{communication}} {{that can be achieved}} by the medium of video games, an exploration he felt to be important to <b>understanding</b> <b>them</b> as an art form. The name The Witness is derived from core gameplay aspect of making the player perceptive of the surroundings to discover meaning and solutions to the puzzles without verbal communication, a similar approach taken by Myst (1993). Blow attributes much of The Witnesss design to Myst, a game that got him into video game development. One aspect of Myst that Blow desired to correct was the nature of [...] "pixel hunting" [...] in some of its puzzles; the player would have to click on various parts of the virtual machinery without knowing what the end result was until sometime later in the puzzle. Within The Witness, Blow created a unifying mechanic for all the puzzles to avoid this confusion, using the maze panels as this mechanic. While the interaction mechanics are the same for all these mazes, the rules and behavior described by the game's symbolic language that limit or result from the interactions form the core of the puzzles in the game. The island was divided into sections so that all the information the player needed to understand the specific behavior of puzzles in that section would be in one general location, a means to [...] " [...] down a lot of ambiguity that used to exist in adventure games". Puzzles within the game were designed to be meaningful {{within the context of the}} game, rather than to be simply a puzzle to be solved, and further aimed to be different from any other puzzle within the game.|$|E

Some of Margaret's blunders stem from ignoring customs, some from not <b>understanding</b> <b>them</b> {{and still others}} from rejecting Milton's social customs (such as a frank, familiar handshake). Other characters fail to carry out important actions: Dixon does not tell Margaret that Thornton attended her mother's funeral, and Mr. Bell dies before he can explain to Thornton why Margaret lied. Margaret feels misunderstood, unable {{to take control of}} her life and explain a world she does not understand (O'Farrell, 1997, p.67).|$|E

2500|$|The {{term was}} coined by the American critic Harold Rosenberg in 1952 and {{signaled}} {{a major shift}} in the aesthetic perspective of New York School painters and critics. According to Rosenberg the canvas was [...] "an arena in which to act". While abstract expressionists such as Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline and Willem de Kooning had long been outspoken in their view of a painting as an arena within which {{to come to terms with}} the act of creation, earlier critics sympathetic to their cause, like Clement Greenberg, focused on their works' [...] "objectness." [...] To Greenberg, it was the physicality of the paintings' clotted and oil-caked surfaces that was the key to <b>understanding</b> <b>them</b> as documents of the artists' existential struggle.|$|E
2500|$|Heidegger claimed {{philosophy}} and science since ancient Greece had reduced things to their presence, {{which was a}} superficial way of <b>understanding</b> <b>them.</b> One crucial source of this insight was Heidegger's reading of Franz Brentano's treatise on Aristotle's manifold uses of the word [...] "being", a work which provoked Heidegger to ask what kind of unity underlies this multiplicity of uses. Heidegger opens his magnum opus, Being and Time, with a citation from Plato's Sophist indicating that Western philosophy has neglected Being because it was considered obvious, rather than as worthy of question. Heidegger's intuition {{about the question of}} Being is thus a historical argument, which in his later work becomes his concern with the [...] "history of Being", that is, the history of the forgetting of Being, which according to Heidegger requires that philosophy retrace its footsteps through a productive destruction of the history of philosophy.|$|E
2500|$|Theory of mind is {{a theory}} insofar as the mind {{is the only thing}} being {{directly}} observed. The presumption that others have a mind is termed a theory of mind because each human can only intuit the existence of their own mind through introspection, and no one has direct access to the mind of another. It is typically assumed that others have minds analogous to one's own, and this assumption is based on the reciprocal, social interaction, as observed in joint attention, the functional use of language, and the understanding of others' emotions and actions. Having theory of mind allows one to attribute thoughts, desires, and intentions to others, to predict or explain their actions, and to posit their intentions. As originally defined, it enables one to understand that mental states can be the cause of—and thus be used to explain and predict—the behavior of others. Being able to attribute mental states to others and <b>understanding</b> <b>them</b> as causes of behavior implies, in part, that one must be able to conceive of the mind as a [...] "generator of representations". If a person does not have a complete theory of mind it may be a sign of cognitive or developmental impairment.|$|E

2500|$|Putting {{the verses}} {{regarding}} polygyny into the broader Qur'anic context {{by examining the}} nature of marriage in Islam helps <b>understanding</b> <b>them.</b> The Quran [...] refers to marriage as a mithaq, i.e. a solemn covenant or agreement between husband and wife, and enjoins that it be put down in writing (4:21). Marriage {{is more than just}} a [...] "solemn covenant" [...] however, with Surah 30 verse 21 stating [...] "And among His Signs is this, that He created for you mates from among yourselves, that ye may dwell in tranquillity with them, and He has put love and mercy between your (hearts): verily in that are Signs for those who reflect." [...] Love and mercy are very much a part of marriage as described in the Qur'an. Although the Qur'an may prescribe different roles for males (husbands often seen as the provider), the equality between husband and wife is promoted when it is dictated in Surah 2 verse 187 that [...] "They (your wives) are as a garment to you, and you are as a garment to them." [...] It is thus clear that there is more to polygyny in the scriptural basis of the Qur'an then simply the citation of Verse 4:3.|$|E
2500|$|With {{his debut}} novel Căderea Bastiliei, Gârbea {{produces}} a satirical portrayal {{of his fellow}} Romanian writers, disguising their real names with anagrams or other word play. Alex. Ştefănescu, who writes that such portrayals caused [...] "great agitation in the literary world", cites the author's own mock-disclaimer: [...] "The identification of some characters with real person constitutes an abuse of interpretation which the author intends to fight off with any legal means." [...] Ştefănescu however cautions against reading Căderea Bastiliei purely as a roman à clef, since the inspiration from [...] "writers' deeds" [...] is [...] "capricious" [...] and the resemblance with real persons [...] "partial". A similar opinion was voiced by poet and journalist Cornelia Maria Savu, who compared the narrator to a puppeteer and further assessed: [...] "Horia Gârbea does not hate his characters, does not love them, he understands them. And by <b>understanding</b> <b>them,</b> he offers them {{a few moments to}} evolve with no strings." [...] Reviewing the work from a stylistic point of view, Paul Aretzu analyzes the intrusion of [...] "intertextual indulgences" [...] throughout the work, identifying allusions to Ion Luca Caragiale, Franz Kafka, Ioan Alexandru Brătescu-Voineşti and others, while also noting the presence of experimental methods echoing James Joyce's Ulysses. Ştefănescu attributes such presences to parody, noting in passing the introduction of situations and even entire passages from Kafka's Metamorphosis and Albert Camus' The Plague.|$|E
