40|$|Trade secrets have {{traditionally}} been protected in various ways by national laws in the European Union. The international intellectual property treaties offered only a limited common core. From this starting point {{this article examines the}} new EU draft directive on trade secrets. The aim is not to put in place a comprehensive EU regime for the protection of trade secrets. There will only be a partial harmonisation of the national laws of the Member States, focussing on the <b>unlawful</b> acquisition, <b>disclosure</b> and use of trade secrets, and that harmonization will be of a minimalist nature in the sense that Member States may provide, in compliance with the provisions of the Treaty, for more far-reaching protection against the unlawful acquisition, use or disclosure of trade secrets than that required in the Directive...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Information {{practices}} that use personal, financial, and health-related information {{are governed by}} US laws and regulations to prevent unauthorized use and disclosure. To ensure compliance under the law, the security and privacy requirements of relevant software systems must properly be aligned with these regulations. However, these regulations describe stakeholder rules, called rights and obligations, in complex and sometimes ambiguous legal language. These “rules ” are often precursors to software requirements that must undergo considerable refinement and analysis before they become implementable. To support the software engineering effort to derive security requirements from regulations, we present a methodology for directly extracting access rights and obligations from regulation texts. The methodology provides statement-level coverage for an entire regulatory document to consistently identify and infer six types of data access constraints, handle complex cross references, resolve ambiguities, and assign required priorities between access rights and obligations to avoid <b>unlawful</b> information <b>disclosures.</b> We present results from applying this methodology to the entire regulation text of the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule.

[...] Ellsberg said there are hundreds of public officials right now who know that the public is being lied to about Iran. They all took an oath to protect the constitution of the United States, not the commander-in-chief, not superior officers. If they follow orders, they may become complicit in starting an unnecessary war. If they are faithful to their oath, they could prevent that war.

40|$|In 2005, a joint {{investigation}} between separate government agencies revealed that Stanmore Cooper, a pilot, failed to disclose to the Federal Aviation Administration {{that he was}} HIV positive. Cooper sued the agencies in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, claiming that they violated the Privacy Act by disclosing his medical records to one another without his consent. Alleging that the <b>unlawful</b> <b>disclosure</b> of his condition caused him severe emotional distress, Cooper sought monetary relief under the Privacy Act’s civil remedies provision, which establishes a cause of action against the government for “actual damages. ” The dispositive issue in Federal Aviation Administration v.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the serious potential for a clash between two sets of values: (1) the stated values of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, that persons handicapped within its terms should not be denied access to decent housing on that account, and that mentally handicapped tenants, especially those who may have, but do not necessarily possess, a propensity for violence, have privacy rights; and (2) the landlord’s responsibilities {{with respect to the}} safety needs of other tenants. The author addresses a number of policies, including those embodied in federal and state statutes relating to the rights of mentally handicapped persons. The article concludes that a landlord’s disclosure of a mentally handicapped tenant’s disability including a propensity toward violence under certain circumstances, to other tenants is <b>unlawful</b> because such <b>disclosure</b> violates the disabled person’s right to evenhanded treatment under general property law principles, infringes upon the disabled person’s privacy rights, and is an implicit violation embodied in the Fair Housing Amendments Act...|$|R
40|$|The Internet of Things (IoT) {{infrastructure}} is a conglomerate of electronic devices interconnected through the Internet, {{with the purpose}} of providing prompt and effective service to end-users. Applications running on an IoT infrastructure generally handle sensitive information such as a patient’s healthcare record, the position of a logistic vehicle, or the temperature readings obtained through wireless sensor nodes deployed in a bushland. The protection of such information from <b>unlawful</b> <b>disclosure,</b> tampering or modification, as well as the unscathed presence of IoT devices, in adversarial environments, is of prime concern. In this paper, a descriptive analysis of the security of standards and technologies for protecting the IoT communication channel from adversarial threats is provided. In addition, two paradigms for securing the IoT infrastructure, namely, common key based and paired key based, are proposed...|$|E

Així, aquest article qüestiona la {{dominant}} personalització de la web de filtracions en Julian Assange, tot mostrant algunes de les més rellevants diferències i/o contradiccions entre el rerefons normatiu de WikiLeaks i la pseudo-filosofia política de l’australià. La meva tesi és que la justificació de la il·legal revelació d’informació secreta i confidencial com a pràctica de desobediència civil es posa en perill per la contaminació de postulats utilitaristes i neoliberals. Contrary to appearances, {{my intention}} is to ridicule and deactivate the strategic use of references to fictional characters by the mass media, which seek to identify the founder of WikiLeaks with this whole project —this makes both its delegitimization and its commoditization easier.

My thesis claims that the justification of the <b>unlawful</b> <b>disclosure</b> of confidential and secret information as a practice of civil disobedience is put at risk due to the tainting from neoliberal and utilitarian postulates...|$|E
40|$|Activist {{investing}} {{has become}} an established phenomenon on the regulated markets in Europe. The market abuse provisions have simultaneously {{been described as the}} Achilles’ heel of activist investors. Nonetheless, specific legal research on the relationship between activist investing and market abuse under the current EU market abuse regime is very limited. This thesis examines the highly critical and unexplored question of when activist investing may amount to market abuse under the EU market abuse regime. In examining that question, this thesis also explores certain defences that would render activist engagements legitimate. This thesis does not only ambitiously restate the EU law in relation to activist investing; it also seeks to further identify, engage with and offer persuasive solutions to deeper underlying issues that relate to activist investing on the regulated markets. The EU Market Abuse Regulation (No 596 / 2014, hereinafter ‘MAR’) established a directly applicable market abuse framework that is to be uniformly interpreted within the EU, which means that the market abuse regime is the same within all of the Union’s Member States. As such, this thesis focuses on its uniform interpretation and systematization in relation to activist investing. The doctrinal analysis of when activist investing may amount to a contravention of the MAR forms the basis of this research, which also enables the thesis to offer useful hands-on advice on EU level compliance to activist investors, issuers, compliance officers, practitioners, supervisory authorities, prosecutors, and judges alike. Moreover, this thesis examines both sides of the activist investing phenomenon: the activist long and the activist short. With this in mind, the thesis also proposes a definition of activist investing. Two types of activist investing, namely activist short-selling and offensive shareholder activism, are studied in closer detail. The thesis ultimately finds that a categorical view on activist investing is to be dismissed. Economic research suggests that lawful activist investing contributes to improving the operational and share price performance of targeted firms in Europe, enhances the price discovery mechanism on the market and increases long-term welfare by discouraging fraudulent behaviour; it further suggests that unlawful activism is likely to have the opposite effects and a negative overall impact on the markets. The topic of this thesis, namely the separation of lawful and unlawful activist investing, is thus of uttermost importance. The findings of this thesis further indicate that the merits of activist investing should be assessed on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the doctrinal methodology and legal framework systematized herein. Further, this thesis discovers that the EU market abuse regime restricts the scope of both public and non-public forms of activist investing. Non-public (or ‘publicity-shy’) activist investors (i. e. activist investors who engage with public companies in private) must particularly consider the limitations instilled by the insider regime; in contrast, activist investors who engage in public campaigns must consider the prohibitions on <b>unlawful</b> <b>disclosure</b> of inside information and market manipulation in addition to certain disclosure obligations that producers and disseminators of investment recommendations are obliged to follow. The thesis further discovers that the EU market abuse regime also effectively hinders activist collaboration (wolf pack activism), as pursuing such collaboration would amount to market abuse provided that the criteria of inside information are met. The thesis additionally suggests that the renewed EU market abuse regime is likely a contributing factor in the recent upsurge of public activism, as activist investors may avoid the insider prohibitions by going public with their demands and agenda. This thesis also finds that activist engagements that amount to market abuse are unlikely to enjoy constitutional protection under the so-called ‘freedom of expression defence’, which activist investors occasionally employ in courts. However, some exceptions to this exist. For example, the disclosure of inside information to the press may enjoy constitutional protection in some Member States but amount to <b>unlawful</b> <b>disclosure</b> in others (in which case constitutional provisions governing freedoms of expression and the press are likely to prevail and effectively limit the scope of the MAR). As such, comparative constitutional research on the relationship between market abuse and the freedoms of expression and the press in Member States is needed. Given that such an examination falls mainly {{beyond the scope of this}} thesis, some proposals for further research in the field are made...|$|E
