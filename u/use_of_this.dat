5|$|As {{feathers}} grow at variable rates, these variations lead to visible {{dark and}} light bands in the fully formed feather.

5|$|The edge {{connector}} or external interface {{at the rear}} of the ZX81 is an extension of the main printed circuit board.

5|$|To {{support the}} deployment, the UN leased {{a number of}} mine-protected {{vehicles}} from the SADF. Most were Buffels, but smaller numbers of Casspir and Wolf vehicles were also leased.

5|$|Adjacent to {{the stadium}} was the Empire Pool, which hosted the Olympic aquatic events and was the first-ever indoor Olympic pool. The pool was longer than the Olympic {{standard}} of , so a wooden platform had to be built to reduce the overall length. Due to lack of space, the pool was covered over so that boxing events could take place. The blackout paint which covered all of the venue windows – still remaining from the Second World War – {{had to be removed}} before the Games. The Olympics were the last event to make <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> pool, before it was concreted over.|$|E
5|$|After {{their own}} house was {{destroyed}} in the Great Kantō earthquake, Raymond designed a new one, the Reinanzaka House, in Azabu, Tokyo. His desire to free himself from Wright's influence led him to explore spatial relationships between living, working and dining areas and how spaces could be closed off with folding screens.The house is built almost entirely of in situ concrete. Raymond's workforce were enthusiastic in their <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> new material, likening it to the walls of traditional kura storehouses. The house itself had metal fenestration, tubular steel trellises and traditional rain chains rather than rainwater downpipes. The interior too was {{well in advance of}} other houses of the International Style with the use of cantilevered tubular steel furniture.|$|E
5|$|Although {{classified}} as poisonous, reports of human deaths resulting from its ingestion are extremely rare. After parboiling—which weakens its toxicity and {{breaks down the}} mushroom's psychoactive substances—it is eaten in parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Amanita muscaria is noted for its hallucinogenic properties, with its main psychoactive constituent being the compound muscimol. The mushroom {{was used as an}} intoxicant and entheogen by the peoples of Siberia, and has a religious significance in these cultures. There has been much speculation on possible traditional <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> mushroom as an intoxicant in other places such as the Middle East, Eurasia, North America, and Scandinavia.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{incidence}} of respiratory depression/arrest is low (0.1–0.5%) when midazolam is administered alone at normal doses, the concomitant use with CNS acting drugs, mainly analgesic opiates, may increase the possibility of hypotension, respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, and death, even at therapeutic doses. Potential drug interactions involving at least one CNS depressant were observed for 84% of midazolam users who were subsequently required to receive the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. Therefore, efforts directed toward monitoring drug interactions and preventing injuries from midazolam administration {{are expected to have}} a substantial impact on the safe <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> drug.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{development of}} vector spaces {{is due to}} the construction of function spaces by Lebesgue. This was later formalized by Banach and Hilbert, around 1920. At that time, algebra and the new field of functional analysis began to interact, notably with key concepts such as spaces of p-integrable functions and Hilbert spaces. Vector spaces, including infinite-dimensional ones, then became a firmly established notion, and many mathematical branches started making <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> concept.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{migration}} routes {{have been}} studied {{by a variety of}} techniques including the oldest, marking. Swans have been marked with a nick on the beak since about 1560 in England. Scientific ringing was pioneered by Hans Christian Cornelius Mortensen in 1899. Other techniques include radar and satellite tracking. The rate of bird migration over the Alps (up to a height of 150 m) was found to be highly comparable between fixed-beam radar measurements and visual bird counts, highlighting the potential <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> technique as an objective way of quantifying bird migration.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 17th century, the {{maritime}} use of the white flag with the Royal coat of arms of Portugal was increasingly restricted to the war ships. An ordinance of 1692 expressly banned the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> flag by the Portuguese merchant ships, restricting its use to ships with 20 or more cannons and with a complement of 40 or more men. The Portuguese merchant ships flew instead green and white striped flags, which were the national colours of Portugal at that time. The colours green and white were also used in other Portuguese flags, like the naval commissioning pennants.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to lead {{also can}} be {{evaluated}} by measuring erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) in blood samples. EP {{is a part of}} red blood cells known to increase when the amount of lead in the blood is high, with a delay of a few weeks. Thus EP levels in conjunction with blood lead levels can suggest the time period of exposure; if blood lead levels are high but EP is still normal, this finding suggests exposure was recent. However, the EP level alone is not sensitive enough to identify elevated blood lead levels below about 35μg/dL. Due to this higher threshold for detection and the fact that EP levels also increase in iron deficiency, <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> method for detecting lead exposure has decreased.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to these preventable issues, GWA studies have attracted more fundamental criticism, mainly because of their assumption that common genetic variation plays {{a large role in}} explaining the heritable variation of common disease. This aspect of GWA studies has attracted the criticism that, although it could not have been known prospectively, GWA studies were ultimately not worth the expenditure. Alternative strategies suggested involve linkage analysis. More recently, the rapidly decreasing price of complete genome sequencing have also provided a realistic alternative to genotyping array-based GWA studies. It can be discussed if the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> new technique is still referred to as a GWA study, but high-throughput sequencing does have potential to side-step some of the shortcomings of non-sequencing GWA.|$|E
5|$|In many organisms, inhibitors may act {{as part of}} a {{feedback}} mechanism. If {{an enzyme}} produces too much of one substance in the organism, that substance may act as an inhibitor for the enzyme {{at the beginning of the}} pathway that produces it, causing production of the substance to slow down or stop when there is sufficient amount. This is a form of negative feedback. Major metabolic pathways such as the citric acid cycle make <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> mechanism.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The purpose <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{paper is}} to develop a {{macroeconomic}} framework to predict the impact of transient donor funding on a developing economy and to facilitate evaluation of the effectiveness <b>of</b> alternative <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> funding in attaining the desired outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: A simulation analysis of the macroeconomic impact of donor funding on the Lebanese economy is conducted. Findings: The paper evaluates the potential outcomes for the country from alternative <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> donor funding and concludes that targeting infrastructure expenditure, mediated through the government, will produce the most beneficial longer term outcomes. Originality/value: This paper is the first substantive macro model to be developed for the Lebanese economy. It is the first major study of the contribution of donor funding to the Lebanese macro-economy. The framework, however, can be generalised to other developing donor recipient nations...|$|R
