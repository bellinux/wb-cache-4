40|$|Drug {{hypersensitivity}} syndromes such as abacavir hypersensitivity and {{the severe}} cutaneous adverse drug reactions {{have been associated}} with significant short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. More recently, these immunologically mediated and previously <b>unpredictable</b> <b>diseases</b> {{have been shown to be}} associated with primarily class I but also class II HLA alleles. The case of the association of HLA-B* 57 : 01 and abacavir hypersensitivity has created a translational roadmap for how this knowledge can be used in the clinic to prevent severe reactions. Although many hurdles exist to the widespread translation of such HLA screening approaches, our understanding of how drugs interact with the major histocompatibility complex has contributed to the discovery of new models that have provided considerable insights into the immunopathogenesis of severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions and other T-cell–mediated drug hypersensitivity syndromes. Future translation of this knowledge will facilitate the development of preclinical toxicity screening to significantly improve efficacy and safety of drug development and design...|$|E
40|$|The {{culture of}} aquatic organisms is still {{hampered}} by the occurrence of <b>unpredictable</b> <b>diseases</b> in their early life stages, which are responsible for massive mortalities and considerable economic losses. A {{better understanding of the}} host-microbe interactions is certainly essential to develop effective solutions of disease control for the aquaculture industry. As demonstrated in terrestrial animals, the use of gnotobiotic systems (animals cultured in axenic conditions or with a known microflora) can be an excellent tool to extent the understanding of the mechanisms involved in host-microbe interactions and to evaluate new treatments of disease control. Several aquatic animals were cultured so far in germ-free conditions, such as fish, molluscs, crustaceans, rotifers, echinoderms, cnidarians, turbellarians, ascidians and echiurans. The aim of the present review is to recapitulate the findings obtained with gnotobiotic aquatic animals over the last decades, with special emphasis to the host-microbe interactions, as well as the perspectives for future research in this field. In addition, the procedures utilized to culture axenic aquatic animals and to verify contaminations are summarized, and the standardization of these procedures is proposed. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background: Idiopathic {{interstitial}} pneumonias (IIPs) are a {{group of}} heterogeneous, somewhat <b>unpredictable</b> <b>diseases</b> characterized by progressive scarring of the interstitium. Since lung function is a key determinant of survival, we reasoned that the transcriptional profile in IIP lung tissue {{would be associated with}} measures of lung function, and could enhance prognostic approaches to IIPs. Results: Using gene expression profiling of 167 lung tissue specimens with IIP diagnosis and 50 control lungs, we identified genes whose expression is associated with changes in lung function (% predicted FVC and % predicted DLCO) modeled as categorical (severe vs mild disease) or continuous variables while adjusting for smoking status and IIP subtype; false discovery rate (FDR) approach was used to correct for multiple comparisons. This analysis identified 58 transcripts that are associated with mild vs severe disease (categorical analysis), including those with established role in fibrosis (ADAMTS 4, ADAMTS 9, AGER, HIF- 1 α, SERPINA 3, SERPINE 2, and SELE) as well as novel IIP candidate genes such as rhotekin 2 (RTKN 2) and peptidase inhibitor 15 (PI 15). Protein-protein interactome analysis of 553 genes whose expression is significantly associated with lung function when modeled as continuous variables demonstrates that more severe presentation of IIPs is characterized by an increase in cell cycle progression and apoptosis, increased hypoxia, and dampened innate immune response. Our findings were validated in an independent cohort o...|$|E

Heart valve defects are <b>unpredictable</b> <b>diseases</b> that can exist without any symptoms for a long time. Heart valve operations comprise the most frequent group second to by-pass operations and nearly a half of all heart-surgical interventions with adult clients. The aim of the thesis was to find out about clients` knowledgeability of postoperative and follow-up care {{in the case of}} heart valve substitute, and what kind of information is needed to achieve by the clients from nurses; what educational materials are used to inform the clients with heart valve substitute and also to find out who are the clients with heart valve substitute informed by. Two hypotheses were predefined: 1 [...] Clients are satisfied with the provided information about postoperative and follow-up care in the case of heart valve substitute; 2 [...] Clients are informed about postoperative and follow-up care in the case of heart valve substitute. Three research inquiries were formed: 1 [...] Which is the most frequent information needed by clients with heart valve substitute from nurses? 2 [...] What kind of education is used for clients with heart valve substitute? 3 [...] Who are the clients with heart valve substitute informed by? Collecting data was performed using the combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods. The quantitative ones were performed as questioning using the technique of a questionnaire, while the qualitative methods used the technique of a semi-standard dialogue. The research sample were the clients with heart valve substitute hospitalised in the cardiosurgical departments of the teaching hospitals in Motol, in Plzeň, in the Hospital České Budějovice, a joint-stock company, and nurses working in those departments. 80 questionnaires for clients were distributed, 74 of them were filled in and returned. Ten nurses were addressed. The above-mentioned four aims were fulfilled. Hypotheses H 1 and H 2 were confirmed. The nurses answered the research inquiries 1, 2 and 3; the answers were analysed and the analyses were used for forming the hypotheses: 1. The most frequent information needed by clients with heart valve substitute from nurses are about moving activity, pain, physiotherapy, connection to instruments, possible complications, about housework, possible staying in spa, return to the occupation, principle of taking Warfarin, about regullary cardiology control. 2. The clients with heart valve substitute are educated by discussion and by the informational brochure. 3. The clients with heart valve substitute are educated by the doctor and the nurse. The results of this thesis will be submitted to the managements of the above mentioned hospitals as material to consider amending the informational brochure for the clients so that they would get the missing information about postoperative and follow-up care in the case of heart valve substitute.

40|$|High-grade non-muscle {{invasive}} bladder cancer (HG-NMIBC) is a clinically <b>unpredictable</b> <b>disease</b> {{with greater}} risks of recurrence and progression {{relative to their}} low-intermediate-grade counterparts. The molecular events, including those affecting the epigenome, that characterise this disease entity {{in the context of}} tumour development, recurrence and progression, are incompletely understood. We therefore interrogated genome-wide DNA methylation using HumanMethylation 450 BeadChip-arrays in 21 primary HG-NMIBC tumours relative to normal bladder controls. Using strict inclusion-exclusion criteria we identified 1, 057 hypermethylated CpGs within gene promoter-associated CpG islands, representing 256 genes. Bisulphite Pyrosequencing validated the array data and examined 25 array-identified candidate genes in an independent cohort of 30 HG-NMIBC and 18 low-intermediate-grade NMIBC. These analyses revealed significantly higher methylation frequencies in high-grade tumours relative to low-intermediate-grade tumours for the ATP 5 G 2, IRX 1 and VAX 2 genes (p< 0. 05), and similarly significant increases in mean levels of methylation in high-grade tumours for the ATP 5 G 2, VAX 2, INSRR, PRDM 14, VSX 1, TFAP 2 b, PRRX 1, and HIST 1 H 4 F genes (p< 0. 05). Although inappropriate promoter methylation was not invariantly associated with reduced transcript expression, a significant association was apparent for the ARHGEF 4, PON 3, STAT 5 a, and VAX 2 gene transcripts (p< 0. 05). Herein, we present the first genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in a unique HG-NMIBC cohort, showing extensive and discrete methylation changes relative to normal bladder and low-intermediate-grade tumours.

Psychological interventions tackling these factors can have beneficial effects on physical and psychological functioning. Recent advances in screening for patients at risk, tailored treatment, and eHealth further broaden the efficiency and scope of these interventions while simultaneously optimizing patient empowerment.

40|$|Objective: {{multiple}} sclerosis (MS) is an incurable, chronic and <b>unpredictable</b> <b>disease</b> {{of the central}} nervous system. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate whether MS patients' illness representations impact on their adjustment to this debilitating illness even when controlling for the severity of their condition. Methods: one hundred and sixty-eight MS patients completed a questionnaire booklet comprised of the Illness Perceptions Questionnaire—Revised and a range of adjustment variables including the Sickness Impact Profile, the Fatigue Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. The severity of patients' MS was measured by the type of MS, length of illness, remission status and ambulatory ability. Results: hierarchical multiple regression analyses demonstrated that illness severity accounted for the majority of the variance in physical and role dysfunction, while patients' illness representations were the most significant predictors of levels of social dysfunction, fatigue, anxiety, depression and self-esteem. Conclusions: patients' illness representations play a significant role in adjustment to MS.

40|$|Purpose. Patient {{engagement}} in multiple sclerosis (MS) care {{can be challenging}} at times given the <b>unpredictable</b> <b>disease</b> course, wide range of symptoms, variable therapeutic response to treatment and high rates of patient depression. Patient activation, a model for conceptualising patients’ involvement in their health care, has been found useful for discerning patient differences in chronic illness management. The {{purpose of this study}} was to validate the patient activation measure (PAM- 13) in an MS clinic sample. Methods. This was a survey study of 199 MS clinic patients. Participants completed the PAM- 13 along with measures of MS medication adherence, self-efficacy, depression and quality of life. Results. Results from Rasch and correlation analyses indicate that the PAM- 13 is reliable and valid for the MS population. Activation was associated with MS self-efficacy, depression and quality of life but not with self-reported medication adherence. Also, participants with relapse-remitting MS, current employment, or high levels of education were more activated than other subgroups. Conclusions. The PAM- 13 is a useful tool for understanding health behaviours in MS. The findings of this study support further clinical consideration and investigation into developing interventions to increase patient activation and improve health outcomes in MS...|$|R
40|$|Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE) is a potentially severe autoimmune condition with an <b>unpredictable</b> <b>disease</b> course, often with fluctuations in disease activity over time. Long term inflammation and drug-related side-effects may subsequently lead to permanent organ damage, a consequence which is intimately connected to decreased {{quality of life}} and mortality. New lupus biomarkers that convey information regarding inflammation and/or organ damage are thus warranted. Today, there is no clinical biomarker that indicates the risk of damage accrual. Herein we highlight the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) and especially its soluble form (suPAR) that besides having biological functions in e. g. proteolysis, cell migration and tissue homeostasis, recently has emerged as a promising biomarker of inflammation and prognosis of several disorders. A strong association between suPAR and organ damage in SLE was recently demonstrated, and preliminary data (presented in this review) suggests the possibility of a predictive value of suPAR blood levels. The involvement of suPAR in the pathogenesis of SLE remains obscure, but its effects in leukocyte recruitment, phagocytic uptake of dying cells (efferocytosis) and complement regulation suggests that the central parts of the SLE pathogenesis could be regulated by suPAR, and vice versa...|$|R

The aim {{of the present study}} is to evaluate the sociodemographic and clinical determinants of quality of life, mental health and health representations of control in Greek patients with multiple sclerosis. A sample of 90 individuals was recruited from three General Hospitals in the broader area of Athens, consisting of patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Measurements were conducted with the following instruments: the World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument (WHOQOL-BREF), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 28) and the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC). Female and older patients reported higher scores in the psychological, social and environmental QOL domains and lower scores in the GHQ- 28 measure. Further, less educated patients presented higher scores in all the domains of WHOQOL-BREF. Married patients presented higher scores in the physical, psychological, social and environmental QOL domains and lower scores in all the subscales of GHQ- 28.

Results: Patients have reported {{that it is difficult to}} deal with this disease, their lives have changed, in particular their body image, as a result of treatment side effects. The lack of familiarity of other people with the disease brings several consequences such as discrimination, difficulties in obtaining a job and changes in their interpersonal relationships. Treatment compliance is often maintained due to the fear related to the <b>unpredictable</b> <b>disease</b> course. The imminence of a possible lupus flare can cause anxiety and fear, imposing limits to their lives.

40|$|Purpose of review: A {{number of}} recent studies have {{explored}} the possibility to apply personalized medicine to interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), particularly idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), {{the most common and}} deadly of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias. In our review, we summarize and discuss the most recent literature on personalized medicine in IPF as well as hypersensitivity pneumonitis and sarcoidosis, with emphasis on patient subgroups for which a personalized approach to disease prognostication and management may become a reality in the near future. Recent findings: Most of the studies that have explored the applicability of personalized medicine to ILDs have been conducted in patients with IPF. Such studies have suggested the existence of several distinct disease subgroups defined by similar genetic profiles, molecular pathways, exposures and individual lifestyles. Personalized medicine in hypersensitivity pneumonitis is in its infancy. The development and applicability of personalized medicine to sarcoidosis, on the other hand, remains problematic for several reasons, including the lack of a diagnostic gold standard, the highly variable and <b>unpredictable</b> <b>disease</b> course, particularly across patients of different ethnicities, the poor correlation between disease activity and disease severity and the lack of a validated management algorithm. Summary: A number of distinct patient subgroups have been identified in ILDs. Although available data need to be validated longitudinally, the possibility to study homogeneous groups of patients may allow prediction of disease behavior and response to treatment with dramatic clinical implications. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Multiple sclerose (MS) is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} {{disease of the}} central nervous system (CNS), in which autoimmune demyelination leads to severe and progressive neurologic decline. A hallmark of MS is its clinical and pathological heterogeneity. This is most evident in the highly variable and <b>unpredictable</b> <b>disease</b> course: some MS patients may remain relatively asymptomatic for decades, whereas others may progress to a state of severe disability and death within years or in cases with fulminant disease even within months after onset. Strongly implicated in the heterogeneity of MS are inter-individual differences in cortisol production by the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) -axis. In most MS patients, the HPA-axis is strongly activated. However, we and others identified an association between low HPA-axis activity and more severe MS. Therefore, this thesis aimed to provide {{a better understanding of the}} relation between activity and regulation of the HPA-axis and various aspects of MS: clinical course, neurodegeneration, lesion pathology, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) polymorphisms, and molecular as well as cellular characteristics of normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). On the whole, this thesis supports the conclusion that high stress-axis activity substantially contributes to suppression of MS disease activity, as the presented evidence strongly suggests that it impacts on clinical course, lesion pathology as well as cellular and molecular mechanisms in the NAWM. Finding ways to evaluate and possibly modify stress-axis responsiveness to inflammation might therefore improve the clinical care of MS patients. In addition, identifying mechanisms to modulate microglia and glucocorticoid-related molecular pathways in the NAWM may represent a valuable therapeutic strategy for preventing lesion formation and disease progression in MS...|$|R
40|$|Patients with end-stage {{renal disease}} (ESRD) who receive {{hemodialysis}} often fail to follow a prescribed diet and fluid regimen, which undermines the effectiveness of care and leads to <b>unpredictable</b> <b>disease</b> progression and greater likelihood of complications. Non-adherence to dietary and fluid limitations compromises the outcomes of patients receiving hemodialysis. Noncompliance can lead to detrimental long-term outcomes including deterioration of the cardiovascular system, heart failure, hypertension, and pulmonary edema as well as short-term problems such as edema, itching, bone pain, and breathlessness. Many {{studies have demonstrated that}} self-efficacy strategies are associated with improved dietary and fluid compliance among individuals receiving hemodialysis. The benefits of self-efficacy include an emphasis on an individual 2 ̆ 7 s control over behavior, continuous and immediate feedback to the client, and a more complete and thorough account of behavior.

Stress in multiple sclerosis raises the risk of significant mental illness, impacts negatively on quality of life, and {{may be associated with}} an increased risk of disease relapse (although the evidence supporting this latter link is limited). Current stress management strategies in multiple sclerosis are limited, with a recent systematic review identifying only one high quality study supporting the use of cognitive behavioural therapy. Mindfulness-based interventions have been demonstrated to help with stress management in other long-term conditions, such as anxiety and recurrent depression. Very {{little is known about the}} use and effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions in people with multiple sclerosis. Methods: This thesis followed the United Kingdom Medical Research Council guidance (2008) on developing and evaluating complex interventions. The research commenced with an epidemiological study of comorbidity in multiple sclerosis using a nationally representative cross-sectional primary care database from Scotland (n= 1, 268, 859, of whom 3, 826 had multiple sclerosis). The analysis focused on 39 other long-term conditions, comparing prevalence rates for people with multiple sclerosis aged 25 or over versus matched controls, controlling for age, sex, and socio-economic status. Results are presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95...|$|R
40|$|Background: Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), {{consisting}} of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD), is a chronic <b>disease</b> with an <b>unpredictable</b> <b>disease</b> behavior and clinical heterogeneity. To ensure high-quality data, {{validation of the}} Montreal classification is mandatory for multicentre prospective data collections. Until now only limited data on {{the reliability of the}} Montreal classification is available. The aim {{of this study was to}} validate the Montreal IBD sub phenotype classification system for CD and UC within the Netherlands. Methods: 20 de-identified medical records were scored by 30 observers with different professions and experience level in both university and non-university hospitals. The inter-observer agreement was calculated by percentages correct answers and Fleiss-kappa (k) using R statistical software. Kappa cut-offs: 0. 8 excellent. Results: The inter-observer agreement was excellent for diagnosis (k= 0. 96), perianal disease (k= 0. 92) and disease location in CD (k= 0. 82) and good for age of onset (k= 0. 67), upper gastrointestinal disease (k= 0. 62), disease behavior in CD (k= 0. 79), disease extent in UC (k= 0. 65) and EIM (k= 0. 68). Disease severity in CD was scored moderate (k= 0. 44) and in UC poor (k= 0. 23). Percentages of correct answers over all Montreal items gives a good reflection of inter-observer agreement (> 80 %), except for disease severity (48 - 74 %). Experience level did not affect the results. Conclusions: We found a good to excellent inter-observer agreement for all Montreal items except for disease severity in CD (moderate) and UC (poor). This study highlights the importance of accurate medical reporting and a clear definition of disease severity. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Scleromyxedema is {{associated}} with a monoclonal gammopathy and other comorbidities. Its prognostic and therapeutic features are poorly documented because most reports deal with single cases or small series. Objective: We sought to describe the characteristics of patients with scleromyxedema regarding demographics, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, therapeutic interventions, and course. Methods: We conducted a retrospective and prospective multicenter study. Results: We identified 30 patients with scleromyxedema (17 men and 13 women). The mean age at diagnosis was 59 years. The mean delay between disease onset and diagnosis was 9 months. Monoclonal gammopathy was detected in 27 patients. Extracutaneous manifestations were present in 19 patients including neurologic (30 %), rheumatologic (23. 3 %), and cardiac (20 %) manifestations. Two patients developed hematologic malignancies. The most common therapies included oral steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins. Although corticosteroids were ineffective, intravenous immunoglobulins (alone or in combination with other drugs) induced complete remission in 4 and partial remission in 9 patients with a mean treatment duration of 2 years. In all, 21 patients were followed up for a mean period of 33. 5 months, at which time 16 patients were alive, 12 with and 4 without skin disease. Five patients died: 2 with dermatoneuro syndrome and 1 each with myeloid leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and myocardial insufficiency. Limitations: This is mainly a retrospective study. Conclusions: Our study confirms that scleromyxedema is a chronic and <b>unpredictable</b> <b>disease</b> with severe systemic manifestations leading to a guarded prognosis. There is no specific definitive treatment. Our data support the contention that intravenous immunoglobulin is a relatively effective and safe treatment. The response is not permanent and maintenance infusions are require...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevailing}} lay {{and medical}} views of cancer as an uncontrollable and <b>unpredictable</b> <b>disease</b> raise {{a question about}} the effect of cancer on personal mastery. Does cancer undermine individuals' beliefs? Are cancer survivors more likely than persons without cancer to feel that life is beyond their control? Using data from the 1994 - 1995 and 2004 - 2006 waves of the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States, I compared cancer survivors and individuals without cancer to examine the association between cancer and personal mastery. According to the stress process perspective, cancer may be detrimental to personal mastery, whereas the positive catalyst perspective suggests that cancer can enhance mastery. When changes in personal mastery are placed in the joint context of developmental aging processes and socio-cultural transformations reflected in the experiences of birth cohorts, support is found for both perspectives. In the three oldest cohorts born between 1920 s and 1940 s, personal mastery declines with age for all participants regardless of their cancer status. Yet, this age-related decline is steeper among cancer survivors than their peers without cancer. In the two youngest cohorts born in the 1950 s and 1960 s, individuals without cancer have a higher level of personal mastery than cancer survivors, yet cancer survivors exhibit a more pronounced increase in mastery with age than persons without cancer. This study suggests that a life course framework can enhance our understanding of cancer-related changes in personal mastery because the life course perspective integrates a psychological focus on adult development and aging with a sociological focus on socio-historical and cultural contexts.
