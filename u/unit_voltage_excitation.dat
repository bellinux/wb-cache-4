40|$|The {{phenomena}} of leader inception and propagation leading to breakdown in strongly attaching gases like $SF_ 6 $ {{are currently being}} studied because of their relevance {{to the design of}} High Voltage Gas Insulated Systems (GIS). Breakdown of $SF_ 6 $ gas under inhomogeneous fields is known to be by the leader mechanism. The leader propagation is guided by the electric field at the leader tip, which in turn is dependent on the nature of voltage applied, electrode geometry and charge distributed in the leader. The charge build up process in the leader is governed by Resistive-Capacitive (R-C) transient fields. In such fields, both permittivities and conductivities of the participating medium determine the field distribution. The scope of the present paper is to discuss the important aspects of computing R-C transient field associated with the leader in $SF_ 6 $ gas modeled as a straight cylindrical conducting channel. Studies are carried out under <b>unit</b> step <b>voltage</b> <b>excitation</b> for two leader lengths and assumed conductivity of the leader.

Therefore, the assessment and improvement in the performance of transformer cores under PWM <b>voltage</b> <b>excitation</b> have become prominent. This project intends to characterise the no-load performance, total power loss and acoustic noise level, of a model three-phase, three-limb laminated transformer core, operating under sinusoidal and PWM <b>voltage</b> <b>excitation.</b> Measurements of total power losses and localised flux density in the joint regions of the core under sinusoidal and PWM <b>voltage</b> <b>excitation</b> for assigned modulation index ma with switching frequency fs varied from 1 kHz to 3 kHz, has been carried out. The analysis highlights the form factor Kf of the secondary induced voltage as a key parameter in controlling the performance of eddy-current component loss in the core. The estimate localised rotational losses due to rotating flux and planar eddy-current losses due to normal flux density in the joints have been analysed, also the analysis of measurement results contributes towards a better understanding of the influence of ma and fs. Moreover, the acoustic noise level of the core and the corresponding vibration at investigated points on the core surface has been measured under sinusoidal and PWM <b>voltage</b> <b>excitation.</b> Measurement results show that the values of acoustic noise and core vibration under PWM <b>voltage</b> <b>excitation</b> were much higher than under corresponding sinusoidal voltage condition. Also, the magneto-mechanical resonant phenomenon of the core under PWM <b>voltage</b> <b>excitation</b> has been observed, which was due to switching frequency fs close to the resonance vibration frequency of the core laminations that is a possible cause of increasing acoustic noise. The measurement results inferred that the resonant phenomenon could possibly occur in cores with different length laminations leading to variability of noise output according to how close the magnetising frequency or predominant harmonics are to the resonant frequency.

40|$|Pole phase {{modulation}} (PPM) of multiphase induction motor (MIM) drives increases {{the speed and}} torque range of MIMs used in high power propulsion and traction. Modulating the phase angle of voltage across stator windings which in turn adjusts the pole of MIMs to achieve wider speed and torque ranges is the basic principle of PPM. 15 -phase PPM induction motor (PPMIM) drive gives 15 -phase 4 -pole, 5 -phase 12 -pole and 3 -phase 20 -pole mode of operations providing wider torque and speed ranges. Due to reduced space harmonics in the air gap because of high phase number, performance of the PPMIM drive under 4 -pole mode of operation is good even with two-level inverter <b>voltage</b> <b>excitation.</b> In case of 5 -phase 12 -pole and 3 -phase 20 -pole modes of operation, space harmonics in the air gap increases due to reduction in phase number resulting increased torque pulsation and decrease in efficiency for two-level <b>voltage</b> <b>excitation.</b> Reducing the time harmonics by increasing the inverter voltage levels {{is one of the}} solutions to improve the performance of PPMIM drives for high pole modes. But employing conventional multilevel inverters for MIMs increases the device count, control complexity and cost of the drive system.
