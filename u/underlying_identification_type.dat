40|$|Social {{identification}} {{is known to}} have wide-reaching implications, but theorists disagree about the underlying motives. Integrating motivated identity construction theory with recent social identity research, the authors predicted which motives <b>underlie</b> <b>identification</b> with two <b>types</b> of groups: interpersonal networks and social categories. In a five-wave longitudinal study of social identity processes among 268 new university residents, multilevel analyses showed that motives involved in identity enactment processes [...] self-esteem, belonging, and efficacy [...] significantly predicted within-person changes in identification with flatmates (an interpersonal network group), whereas motives involved in identity definition processes [...] meaning, self-esteem, and distinctiveness [...] significantly predicted within-person changes in identification with halls of residence (an abstract social category). This article discusses implications for research into identity motives and social identity...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{relations}} between team learning and a quasi-closedness property inherent in many <b>identification</b> <b>types</b> considered in inductive inference. This property is as follows: there exists such n that, if every union of n Γ 1 classes out of U 1; : : :; Un is identifiable, {{so is the}} union of all n classes. This property can be formulated in terms of team learning, but in practice the research in team learning have followed one path, while investigations of the quasi-closedness property have led along another path. Here we investigate the connection between quasi-closedness and team learning more closely. We show that the numbers n for which the quasiclosedness holds determine the largest element of the so-called hierarchy of success ratios of an <b>identification</b> <b>type.</b> We also investigate quasiclosedness of team <b>identification</b> <b>types</b> themselves.

Our main contribution is to clarify and improve on the <b>underlying</b> <b>identification</b> strategy and to emphasise {{the role played}} by the institutional environment. Instrumental variables estimates for post-colonial societies reveal that the strength of the state, as proxied empirically by an index of bureaucratic quality, exerts a strong preventive effect on rebellion.

40|$|We used {{repetition}} blindness {{to investigate}} {{the nature of the}} representations <b>underlying</b> <b>identification</b> of manipulable objects. Observers named objects presented in rapid serial visual presentation streams containing either manipulable or nonmanipulable objects. In half the streams, 1 object was repeated. Overall accuracy was lower when streams contained 2 different manipulable objects than when they contained only nonmanipulable objects or a single manipulable object. In addition, nonmanipulable objects induced repetition blindness, whereas manipulable objects were associated with a repetition advantage. These findings suggest that motor information plays a direct role in object identification. Manipulable objects are vulnerable to interference from other objects associated with conflicting motor programs, but they show better individuation of repeated objects associated with the same action.

40|$|Throughout reading development, {{a gradual}} shift {{is seen in}} the {{processes}} <b>underlying</b> word <b>identification</b> from serial decoding toward parallel processing or sight word reading. It has been argued that this shift can be detected in the correlations between serial and discrete naming of alphanumeric symbols (digits and letters) and words. In the current study, we examined the relations between alphanumeric symbol naming and reading of monosyllabic and multisyllabic words and nonwords in two languages that differ in orthographic consistency: English and Dutch. A sample of 92 English-speaking Canadian children and 101 Dutch children, all in Grade 5, were assessed on discrete and serial naming of digits and letters and on serial and discrete naming of monosyllabic and multisyllabic words and nonwords. Results showed that discrete naming of alphanumeric symbols closely resembled discrete reading of monosyllabic words, suggesting that these words are processed in parallel in both languages. Both serial and parallel reading processes were found to <b>underlie</b> <b>identification</b> of multisyllabic words as well as monosyllabic nonwords. However, differences between the two languages emerged when processing multisyllabic nonwords. Whereas English-speaking children relied more on parallel reading processes to read multisyllabic nonwords, Dutch-speaking children processed these items serially.

A total of 405 fresh and stock gram-negative isolates comprising 54 species were tested in the efficacy phase; 96. 8 % of these species were identified correctly {{in comparison to the}} identification obtained either with the API 20 E system (bioMérieux Vitek, Hazelwood, Mo.) or by the conventional tube method.

A total of 465 isolates were examined for intra- and interlaboratory identification reproducibility and gave an agreement of 464 of 465, or 99. 8 %.

5000|$|In the 21st century, the {{physiology}} <b>underlying</b> <b>identification</b> and the neurological {{delay is}} thought to involve autoassociative memory, a neural mechanism crucial to intelligence. Briefly explained, autoassociative memory retrieves previously stored representations that most closely conform to any current incoming pattern (level II in the general semantics diagram) arriving from the senses. According to the memory-prediction model for intelligence, if the stored representations resolve the arriving patterns, this constitutes [...] "understanding", and brain activity shifts from evaluation to triggering motor responses. When the retrieved representations do not sufficiently resolve newly arrived patterns, evaluating persists, engaging higher layers of the cortex in an ongoing pursuit of resolution. The additional time required for signals to travel {{up and down the}} cortical hierarchy constitutes what general semantics calls a [...] "beneficial neurological delay".|$|R

Next, we show how to extend these results to the forward-security setting based on ideas from the Itkis-Reyzin forward-secure signature scheme. Unlike the original Itkis-Reyzin scheme, our construction can be instantiated under different decisional complexity assumptions and has a much tighter security reduction. Finally, we show that the tighter security reductions provided by our proof methodology can result in concrete efficiency gains in practice, both in the standard and forward-security setting, {{as long as the}} use of stronger security assumptions is deemed acceptable.
