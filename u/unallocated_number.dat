Various unallocated geographic and non-geographic numbers play an announcement directing callers {{to call a}} particular {{directory enquiries}} number for help. People may hear this message when they mis-dial a wanted number or may appear to have missed {{a call from the}} <b>unallocated</b> <b>number</b> and hear this message if they call back.|$|E

50|$|Overlays gained {{popularity}} among Canadian telephone {{companies in the}} early 2000s, primarily as a workaround for the country's inefficient number allocation system. Every competing carrier is issued blocks of 10,000 numbers, the maximum for each corresponding three-digit prefix, in each rate centre in which it offers new service and each local interconnection region in which it ports existing numbers. While most rate centres in Canada do not need nearly that many numbers to adequately service customers, a number cannot be reassigned elsewhere once assigned to a carrier and rate centre. This resulted in {{a large amount of}} <b>unallocated</b> <b>numbers</b> and the proliferation of cell phones, fax machines, pagers and dial-up Internet connections, particularly in larger markets, exacerbated this. Partly due to these factors, the numbering plan areas corresponding to four of the five largest Canadian markets (416 in Toronto, 514 in Montreal, 604 in Vancouver, and 403 in Calgary) were split in the 1990s.|$|R
5000|$|Except with [...] "AM" [...] or [...] "LC" [...] prefixes, any <b>unallocated</b> usual <b>numbers</b> may be {{reserved}} for auction, provided it has an earlier prefix in the sequence, or the current prefix, or the next immediate prefix. For example, if the current prefix is [...] "LX", then a number with a prefix [...] "AA", [...] "AB", ..."AZ", [...] "BA", ... "LX", or [...] "LY" [...] may {{be reserved}} for auction. Numbers having no prefix or a [...] "XX" [...] prefix may also {{be reserved for}} auction. It is doubtful whether numbers with the [...] "ZG" [...] prefix may be reserved for auction after the prefix runs to [...] "ZF".To reserve a non-special registration mark for auction, one needs to pay a deposit of HK$1000. The minimum price for the number is also HK$1000. If the number is successfully bid for by a person other than the person who reserved the number, their deposit is refunded. If no one else bids at the auction, the number is sold {{to the person who}} reserved the number, for HK$1000. If it is a special registration mark, there is no deposit to pay, and the minimum price will be set by the Transport Department but will be higher than HK$1000.|$|R
