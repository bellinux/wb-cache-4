5|$|Whether {{the pyramid}} was {{finished}} or left <b>unfinished</b> is disputed among experts. The egyptologist Rainer Stadelmann {{believes that the}} pyramid was indeed finished, but others, such as Miroslav Verner, think that the building was left <b>unfinished</b> because of the pharaoh's premature death. In particular, no traces of outer cladding were found, which could hint that there never was one because the pyramid was not completed.|$|E
5|$|Chandler left an <b>unfinished</b> novel when he died. This was {{completed}} by Robert B. Parker and published in 1989 as Poodle Springs.|$|E
5|$|His The Method of Sociology first {{introduced}} {{his concept of}} divisions within subfields of sociology. His most notable works included two books published {{in the same year}} (1952): Modern Nationalities, and Cultural Sciences. The former is an analysis of the evolution of national-culture societies, and the latter presents a theoretical study of the relation between sociology and other sciences. Znaniecki never finished his magnum opus, Systematic Sociology, which would eventually be collected and published posthumously in its <b>unfinished</b> but final form as Social Relations and Social Roles: The <b>Unfinished</b> Systematic Sociology (1965).|$|E
5|$|However, the 1985 {{plan was}} not fully {{completed}} by 2007 {{due to the}} lingering <b>unfinished</b> segment of Loop 202 between University Drive and Power Road in Mesa, where work wrapped up on July 21, 2008.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} renamed Weser, but work was ceased in June 1943, before the {{conversion}} was completed. The <b>unfinished</b> vessel was {{then transferred to}} Königsberg, where she remained {{for the rest of}} the war. On 29 January 1945, the ship was scuttled before the advancing Soviet Red Army could seize her. The Soviet Navy nevertheless considered using the wreck for parts to complete the cruiser , a sister-ship of Seydlitz the Soviets had purchased <b>unfinished</b> before the outbreak of war. This was not carried out, however, and the ship was broken up for scrap.|$|E

5|$|As a corollary, Nyuserre {{was almost}} {{certainly}} a son of Neferirkare Kakai as Khentkaus II was Neferirkare's queen. This relationship is also indicated by the location of Nyuserre's pyramid in Abusir next to that of Neferirkare, {{as well as his}} reuse for his own valley temple of materials from Neferikare's <b>unfinished</b> constructions.|$|E
5|$|Champfleury was {{intimidated by}} her {{vitality}} and jealousy, and removed himself from her life. On his recommendation, she turned creative control of Balzac's <b>unfinished</b> novels Le Député d'Arcis and Les Petits Bourgeois to another writer, Charles Rabou. Rabou added extensively {{to them and}} published both books in 1854. To soothe the publisher, Hańska falsely claimed that Balzac had chosen Rabou as his literary successor.|$|E
5|$|Djedkare {{may have}} left {{some of his}} monuments <b>unfinished</b> at his death, as {{suggested}} by several relief-bearing blocks inscribed with his name and which were found reused in the pyramid of king Unas. Their original setting remains unknown.|$|E

Frank and Lucy then enjoy their picnic.|$|E
5|$|In 1638, the Santa Margherita Lines {{began to}} be built {{encircling}} the land fronts of Birgu and Sengela. Works were suspended in 1645 {{due to a lack}} of funds, and they remained <b>unfinished</b> for many years. Following the fall of Candia to the Ottomans in 1669, a second line of fortifications, the Cottonera Lines, {{began to be}} built encircling both Birgu and Senglea, as well as the <b>unfinished</b> Santa Margherita Lines. They were begun in 1670, but works stopped in 1680 again {{due to a lack of}} funds. By this time, the bastioned enceinte had been built, although other crucial parts had not yet been constructed. Eventually, some effort was done to complete both the Santa Margherita and Cottonera Lines in the early 18th century, although some of the planned ravelins, cavaliers, ditch and other fortifications were never constructed. Fort San Salvatore was built on one of the Cottonera Lines bastions in 1724.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 Christopher Tolkien {{published}} {{a collection of}} more fragmentary material, under the title <b>Unfinished</b> Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth. In subsequent years (1983–1996) he {{published a}} large amount of the remaining unpublished materials, together with notes and extensive commentary, in a series of twelve volumes called The History of Middle-earth. They contain <b>unfinished,</b> abandoned, alternative, and outright contradictory accounts, since they were always a work in progress for Tolkien and he only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the stories. There is not complete consistency between The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, the two most closely related works, because Tolkien never fully integrated all their traditions into each other. He commented in 1965, while editing The Hobbit for a third edition, that he would have preferred to completely rewrite the book because of the style of its prose.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, an {{extended}} cut {{was released on}} VHS and premiered on the ABC television network. It added roughly 12minutes to the film. The added footage was largely <b>unfinished,</b> and cobbled together for the network premiere; Wise hadn't wanted some of the footage {{to be included in}} the final cut of the film. This version was released by Paramount in late 1983 on VHS, Betamax, and Laserdisc.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{a janitor}} of Sony/ATV Music Publishing {{found in a}} {{dumpster}} the <b>unfinished</b> lyrics written by Williams that {{had been found in}} his car the night he died. The worker claimed that she sold Williams' notes to a representative of the Honky-Tonk Hall of Fame and the Rock-N-Roll Roadshow. The janitor was accused of theft, but the charges were later dropped when a judge determined that her version of events was true. The <b>unfinished</b> lyrics were later returned to Sony/ATV, which handed them to Bob Dylan in 2008 to complete the songs for a new album. Ultimately, the completion of the album included recordings by Alan Jackson, Norah Jones, Jack White, Lucinda Williams, Vince Gill, Rodney Crowell, Patty Loveless, Levon Helm, Jakob Dylan, Sheryl Crow and Merle Haggard. The album, named The Lost Notebooks of Hank Williams was released on October 4, 2011.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, {{the actor}} {{screened}} his multimedia project entitled Three's Company The Drama, {{in which he}} merges video and art to update the former sitcom, at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. Franco reunited with Milk director Van Sant to make <b>Unfinished,</b> a project that features two movies: Endless Idaho and My Own Private River. Endless Idaho showcases edited outtakes, deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes footage from the 1991 movie My Own Private Idaho, while My Own Private River focuses on the late actor River Phoenix. The idea for the exhibition was conceived after Van Sant introduced unused footage from the 1991 film to Franco, inspiring him {{to turn it into}} something more. <b>Unfinished</b> opened from February 26 to April 9 at the Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills.|$|E
5|$|In May 2016, Turtle Rock {{announced}} {{that the company was}} working on a new intellectual property to be published by Perfect World Entertainment.

5|$|It is {{not known}} why Anderson chose the name Winesburg for the town in the book. What is known is that the name was not {{necessarily}} inspired by the stories themselves. In actuality, Anderson had been using Winesburg, Ohio {{as a base for}} Talbot Whittingham, the protagonist of an <b>unfinished</b> novel he had been writing on-and-off for several years prior to the composition of the Winesburg stories.|$|E
5|$|Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman is the 18th-century British feminist Mary Wollstonecraft's <b>unfinished</b> novelistic {{sequel to}} her revolutionary {{political}} treatise A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792). The Wrongs of Woman was published posthumously in 1798 by her husband, William Godwin, {{and is often}} considered her most radical feminist work.|$|E
5|$|More recently, in 2007, The Children of Húrin was {{published}} by HarperCollins (in the UK and Canada) and Houghton Mifflin (in the US).

The material was compiled by Christopher Tolkien from The Silmarillion, <b>Unfinished</b> Tales, The History of Middle-earth, and unpublished manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|Much of Halo 4s {{music was}} written on guitar or piano; at home, Davidge would {{sometimes}} sing melodies into a dictaphone for later transcription. While composing, he viewed slideshow images and visual material to influence his work.

5|$|On October 4, 2011, Dylan's label, Egyptian Records, {{released}} {{an album of}} previously unheard Hank Williams songs, The Lost Notebooks of Hank Williams.
