50|$|It {{is evident}} from that last remark that Beckett meant his play to stand as an ironic comment on Oh! Calcutta! But someone {{tampered}} with the text, and added a stage direction to include naked people to the miscellaneous rubbish. When the book of Oh! Calcutta! was published by Grove Press, not only was this <b>unauthorised</b> <b>addition</b> added, but Beckett’s name was the only author listed and attached {{to one of the}} pieces, despite the agreement that the authors would be anonymous. On top of that, the photograph on the page that faced Beckett's script showed the naked bodies.|$|E
50|$|The {{cylinder}} is inspected for dents, cracks, gouges, cuts, bulges, laminations {{and excessive}} wear, heat damage, torch or electric arc burns, and corrosion damage. The cylinder is also checked for illegible, incorrect or unauthorised permanent stamp markings, and <b>unauthorised</b> <b>additions</b> or modifications.

5|$|The {{cylinder}} is inspected externally for dents, cracks, gouges, cuts, bulges, laminations {{and excessive}} wear, heat damage, torch or electric arc burns, corrosion damage, illegible, incorrect or unauthorised permanent stamp markings, and <b>unauthorised</b> <b>additions</b> or modifications. Unless the cylinder walls are examined by ultrasonic methods, the interior must be visually inspected using sufficient illumination {{to identify any}} damage and defects, particularly corrosion. If the inner surface is not clearly visible it should first be cleaned by an approved method which does not remove {{a significant amount of}} wall material. When there is uncertainty whether a defect found during visual inspection meets the rejection criteria, additional tests may be applied, such as ultrasonic measurement of pitting wall thickness, or weight checks to establish total weight lost to corrosion.|$|R
6000|$|The Caliph Abd al-Malik bin Marwan besieged Abdullah bin Zubayr, who, after a brave defence, was slain. In A.H. 74, Hajjaj bin Yusuf, {{general of}} Abd al-Malik’s troops, {{wrote to the}} prince, informing him that Abdullah had made <b>unauthorised</b> <b>additions</b> to {{and changes in the}} Harim: the reply brought an order to rebuild the house. Hajjaj again {{excluded}} the Hatim and retired the northern wall six cubits and a span, making it twenty-five cubits long by twenty-four broad; the other three sides were allowed to remain as built by the son of Zubayr. He gave the house a double roof, closed the western door, and raised the eastern four cubits and a span above the Mataf, or circuit, which he paved over. The Harim was enlarged and beautified by the Abbasides, especially by Al-Mahdi, Al-Mutamid, and Al-Mutazid. Some authors reckon, as an eleventh house, the repairs made by Sultan Murad Khan. On the night of Tuesday, 20th Sha’aban, A.H. 1030, a violent torrent swept the Harim; it rose one cubit above the threshold of the Ka’abah, carried away the lamp-posts and the ...|$|R
500|$|Gilbert {{prepared}} meticulously {{for each}} new work, making {{models of the}} stage, actors and set pieces, and designing every action and bit of business in advance. Gilbert would not work with actors who challenged his authority. George Grossmith wrote that, at least sometime, [...] "Mr. Gilbert is a perfect autocrat, insisting that his words should be delivered, even to an inflection of the voice, as he dictates. He will stand on the stage beside the actor or actress, and repeat the words with appropriate action over and over again, until they are delivered as he desires them to be." [...] Even during long runs and revivals, Gilbert closely supervised the performances of his plays, {{making sure that the}} actors did not make <b>unauthorised</b> <b>additions,</b> deletions or paraphrases. Gilbert was famous for demonstrating the action himself, even as he grew older. Gilbert himself went on stage in a number of productions throughout his lifetime, including several performances as the Associate in Trial by Jury, as substitute for an ailing actor in his play Broken Hearts, and in charity matinees of his one-act plays, such as King Claudius in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.|$|R
5000|$|Some old income {{drawdown}} schemes were capped drawdown. While {{there is}} no government imposed minimum income to be taken, the maximum {{that can be taken}} is prescribed or [...] "capped". The limit applies to the total of payments taken as income withdrawal and short-term annuitiesThe new maximum amount of income that may be drawn is 150% (previously 120% pre 27/03/2014) of the single life annuity that a person of the same gender and age could purchase based on Government Actuary’s Department rates. In other words, one's pension provider calculates the maximum income the saver can receive, using standard tables prepared by the Government Actuary’s Department. This can mean that, if a person is in poor health, he or she should take specific advice from an Independent Financial Adviser on his/her personal position, as the pensioner may be better off with an Impaired Life Annuity with guaranteed options. [...] The maximum limit is reviewed every 3 years until age 75 and yearly thereafter. Exceeding the limit will be classed as [...] "an unauthorised payment". [...] The pensioner will be liable to tax currently between 40% & 55% on the <b>unauthorised</b> payment. In <b>addition</b> to the tax charge imposed on the pensioner, the scheme administrator will have to pay a scheme sanction tax charge of at least 15 per cent of the unauthorised payment ...|$|R
40|$|The DNA target {{sequence}} {{is the key}} element in designing detection methods for genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Unfortunately this information is frequently lacking, especially for <b>unauthorised</b> GMOs. In <b>addition,</b> patent sequences are generally poorly annotated, buried in complex and extensive documentation and hardly associable to the corresponding GM event. Here we present the JRC GMO-Amplicons, a database of amplicons collected by screening public nucleotide sequence databanks by in silico determination of PCR amplification with reference methods of GMO analysis. The European Union Reference Laboratory for Genetically Modified Food and Feed of the European Commission (EU-RL GMFF) provides these methods in the GMOMETHODS database for supporting enforcement of EU legislation and GM food/feed control. The JRC GMO-Amplicons database is composed of more than 240, 000 amplicons, which can be easily accessed and screened through a web-interface. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} attempt of pooling and collecting publicly available sequences related to GMOs in food and feed. The JRC GMO-Amplicons supports control laboratories in the design and assessment of GMO methods, providing inter-alia in silico prediction of primers specificity and GM targets coverage. The new tool may assist the laboratories in the analysis of complex issues, such as detection and identification of unauthorised GMOs. Notably, the JRC GMO-Amplicons database may allow the retrieval and characterisation of GMO-related sequences also included in patents documentation. Finally, it could help annotating poorly described GM sequences and identifying new relevant GMO-related sequences in public databases. The JRC GMO-Amplicons is freely accessible through a web-based portal that is hosted on the EURL-GMFF web-site. JRC. I. 3 -Molecular Biology and Genomic...|$|R
40|$|The {{explosion}} of digital {{content and the}} heterogeneity of enterprise content sources have pushed existing data integration solutions to their boundaries. An alternative solution {{is to use the}} Resource Description Framework (RDF) together with the existing web infrastructure, commonly known as the Linked Data Web (LDW), as a means to integrate both public and private data. With the advent of SPARQL 1. 1, it is possible not only to execute queries over the LDW, but also to use the SPARQL query language to maintain distributed graph data. However, such a decentralised architecture brings with it a number of additional challenges with respect to both data security and integrity. In this thesis, we focus on the problem of access control for the LDW. We are particularly interested in lifting both the data and the access control policies from existing line of business applications and enforcing and maintaining access control over linked data, irrespective of how it is published. We start by proposing a lifting strategy, which can be used to extract both data and access control policies from relational databases. The access permissions are represented using an extension of the RDF model known as annotated RDF (aRDF), which allows contextual information to be associated with RDF data. By using aRDF domain operations it is possible to combine different annotations for the same triple and to infer new annotations based on RDF Schema (RDFS) inference rules. We demonstrate how the proposed modelling, together with a set of inference rules, can be used to provide support for commonly used access control models, such as Role-Based Access Control, Attribute Based Access Control and View Based Access Control. With regards to the enforcement and administration of access control over RDF, we focus specifically on Discretionary Access Control (DAC). Given DAC allows users to delegate their permissions to others, it is particularly suitable for managing access control over distributed data. Although a number of authors demonstrate how they can used Semantic Web technology to represent DAC policies, the authors do not examine DAC from a data model perspective. In order to fill this gap, we provide a summary of access control requirements for the RDF data model, based on the different characteristics of the RDF data model compared to relational and tree data models. In order to support access control policy specification at the triple, resource, graph and schema level, authorisations are specified using graph patterns. In addition, we demonstrate how our proposed flexible graph based authorisation framework, which we call GFAF, can be used to cater for the specification, administration and enforcement of DAC policies over linked data. Given the proposed access control framework enforces access control at the query layer, when access to the requested RDF data is partially restricted, it is necessary to rewrite the query so that it behaves {{in the same manner as}} a query executed over a filtered dataset. Therefore, we propose a query rewriting strategy for both the SPARQL 1. 1 query and update languages, that can be used to partially restrict access to <b>unauthorised</b> data. In <b>addition,</b> we demonstrate how a set of criteria, which was originally used to verify relational access control policies, can be adapted to ensure the correctness of access control over RDF via query rewriting...|$|R
