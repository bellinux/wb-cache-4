5|$|M-97 {{runs through}} an <b>urbanized</b> <b>area</b> {{in the larger}} Metro Detroit. The highway starts at M-3/Gratiot Avenue and follows Gunston Street northwesterly. This {{intersection}} is one block northeast of the Coleman A. Young International Airport in Detroit. At McNichols Road, which forms part of 6 Mile Road in the Mile Road System, M-97 turns north on Hoover Street, and follows it north past Bessy Playground at 7 Mile Road. It continues north on Hoover until it turns onto Groesbeck Highway, just one block south of M-102/8 Mile Road.|$|E
5|$|North of the line, {{the highway}} follows West Side Saginaw Road through fields {{in a less}} <b>urbanized</b> <b>area.</b> West of University Center and the campus of Delta College, M-84 crosses over I-75/US23 at exit160 and {{proceeds}} through several curves into Bay City. At the intersection with Euclid Avenue on the city line, M-13 merges in {{from the north and}} the two highways run concurrently along Salzburg Avenue. Since this segment of highway is both northbound M-84 and southbound M-13 along eastbound Salzburg Avenue, the two trunklines form a wrong-way concurrency.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The World is {{undergoing}} rapid urbanization, with 70 % of the World population expected {{to live in}} urban areas by 2050. Nevertheless, nationally representative analysis of the health differences in the leading causes of avoidable mortality disaggregated by urbanization level is lacking. We undertake a study of temporal trends in mortality rates for deaths considered avoidable by the Concerted Action of the European Community on Avoidable Mortality for four different levels of urbanization in Taiwan between 1971 and 2008. We find that for virtually all causes of death, age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) were lower in more urbanized than less <b>urbanized</b> <b>areas,</b> either throughout the study period, or {{by the end of}} the period despite higher rates in <b>urbanized</b> <b>areas</b> initially. Only breast cancer had consistently higher AMSRs in more <b>urbanized</b> <b>areas</b> throughout the 38 -year period. Further, only breast cancer, lung cancer, and ischemic heart disease witnessed an increase in ASMRs in one or more urbanization categories. More <b>urbanized</b> <b>areas</b> in Taiwan appear to enjoy better indicators of health outcomes in terms of mortality rates than less <b>urbanized</b> <b>areas.</b> Access to and the availability of rich healthcare resources in urban areas may have contributed to this positive result...|$|R
40|$|In this research, natural <b>areas</b> and <b>urbanized</b> <b>areas</b> in a {{waterfront}} {{of southern}} Osaka were classified according to ground cover using Landsat TM data, and an {{attempt was made}} to improve the accuracy of such classifications. DN values from band 6 were then used to investigate the relationship between the above ground cover classifications and surface temperature. It was found that accuracy was high in classifying forested and other green categories. In <b>urbanized</b> <b>areas,</b> which have long been thought difficult to classify accurately, it was found that uniform ground cover conditions generate uniform band characteristics. Thus it was demonstrated that even <b>urbanized</b> <b>areas</b> can be classified with some degree of accuracy. Regardless of classification category, areas where the ground cover was <b>urbanized</b> <b>areas</b> had a higher surface temperature than other areas, and {{it was found that the}} sea had the effect of lowering surface temperatures on adjacent land...|$|R

25|$|Physical {{expansion}} of the <b>urbanized</b> <b>area</b> in southern Florida is constrained by its location between the Atlantic Ocean {{to the east and}} the federally protected Everglades wetlands to the west. Though there is more land that can legally be developed before cutting in to Everglades National Park, Miami-Dade County has a politically defined Urban Development Boundary (UDB), which is only amended to allow further development after due process, with considerations such as population growth and amount and location of undeveloped land available within the UDB. This trend lends itself to increasing density within the <b>urbanized</b> <b>area,</b> with a focus on areas with transit; however, most of the expansions of the UDB are for low-density residential developments of less than five units per acre. This contrasts sharply with the downtown Miami area, where zoning allows development up to 1,000 units per acre, and zoning allowances are amended as the downtown area expands.|$|E
