Tags may be locked after programming, to avoid <b>unauthorized</b> <b>reprogramming.</b> Locked tags may only be unlocked by the same phone that locked them.|$|E
40|$|The growing {{range of}} Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) applications, their {{long-life}} and large-scale design, {{as well as}} various deployment fields necessitate the feasibility of remote maintenance and reprogramming of in-situ sensor nodes. The network-wide dissemination of program code is not appropriate in every WSN due to the heterogeneity of sensor hardware, the diversity of sensing tasks, and the event and location dependency of software. Thus, a flexible and group-wise selective Over-The-Air Programming (OTAP) is required in these scenarios. Furthermore, securing the OTAP protocol is imperative {{in order to prevent}} <b>unauthorized</b> and malicious <b>reprogramming</b> attempts. In this paper, we introduce SenSeOP, a selective and secure OTAP protocol for WSNs. For this purpose, the proposed protocol uses multicast transfer supported by asymmetric cryptography. We evaluate the performance of our approach in real testbeds, compare it with state-of-the-art protocols, and show that this approach enables efficient and reliable wireless reprogramming...|$|R
