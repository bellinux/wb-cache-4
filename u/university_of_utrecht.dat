He studied medicine in Amsterdam and at the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Utrecht</b> under Franciscus Donders and Jacobus Schroeder van der Kolk, obtaining a doctorate on a dissertation on hepatic glucose production in diabetes in 1856. His thesis appeared shortly {{after the publication of}} related work by the French physiologist Claude Bernard. Stokvis may also have been influenced by the chemist Gerardus Mulder in Amsterdam. Subsequently, he travelled to Paris and Vienna (and possibly Prague), before establishing himself in medical practice in Amsterdam. He continued his medical research under the physiologists Adriaan Heynsius, Wilhelm Kühne and Thomas Place. In 1867, the Brussels Academy awarded a gold medal to Stokvis for an essay on the development of albuminuria, a kidney disorder in which the protein albumin can be detected in the urine.|$|E

25|$|In June 2006, it was {{reported}} that the scientific director of the (formerly) Debye Institute had been reprimanded by the Board of Directors of the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Utrecht</b> for a new publication on Debye's war years {{on the grounds that it}} was too personally biased with respect to the Institute's naming dispute. According to the board, the book should have been published not as a Debye Institute publication, but as a personal one. The book was banned by the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Utrecht</b> and both Directors of the (former) Debye Institute were forbidden to have any further contact with the press. A dozen professors of the Physics Faculty, amongst whom Cees Andriesse, openly protested against the interventions of the Board and the censorship of their protest by the university.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1935 Pais began his studies at the University of Amsterdam without a clear idea {{regarding}} his desired career. With {{an interest in the}} exact sciences, he gradually gravitated to chemistry and physics as major subjects, and mathematics and astronomy as minor subjects. In the winter of 1936/1937 his career goals were defined by two guest lectures by George Uhlenbeck, professor of theoretical physics at <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Utrecht.</b> Pais was fascinated by Uhlenbeck's discussion of Enrico Fermi's incorporation of the neutrino into the theory of beta radiation.|$|E
25|$|Several {{theories}} {{from the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries connected Etruscan to Uralic or even Altaic languages. In 1874, the British scholar Isaac Taylor brought {{up the idea of}} a genetic relationship between Etruscan and Hungarian, of which also Jules Martha would approve in his exhaustive study La langue étrusque (1913). In 1911, the French orientalist Baron Carra de Vaux suggested a connection between Etruscan and the Altaic languages. The Hungarian connection was recently revived by Mario Alinei, Emeritus Professor of Italian Languages at the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Utrecht.</b> Alinei's proposal has been rejected by Etruscan experts such as Giulio M. Facchetti, Finno-Ugric experts such as Angela Marcantonio, and by Hungarian historical linguists such as Bela Brogyanyi.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1938 Pais {{enrolled}} for graduate classes at <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Utrecht.</b> Uhlenbeck, however, spent that term as a visiting professor at Columbia University in New York City. He left Pais {{with the use of}} his laboratory and a list of topics to study and work on. Pais was soon exposed to other prominent Dutch physicists and areas of research in experimental physics. He became well-acquainted with Hendrik Casimir, a physics professor at Leiden University who lectured at Utrecht twice a week on quantum physics. When Uhlenbeck returned from America, he brought news of a meeting he had attended in Washington, D.C., in which Niels Bohr and Enrico Fermi had first made public their news about nuclear fission. Uhlenbeck also announced that he would be leaving in the summer of 1939 for a professorship at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.|$|E

They both saved up money for six months and planned to go to Panama together on a special trip to learn Spanish, as well as to do something of significance for the locals, particularly volunteering with children. The trip was also supposed to be a reward to Froon for graduating.|$|E
25|$|Pieter Geyl was {{the leading}} {{historian}} of the Dutch Revolt, and a highly influential professor at the University of London (1919–1935) and at the State <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Utrecht</b> (1936–58). He wrote a six-volume history of the Dutch-speaking peoples. The Nazis imprisoned him in World War II. In his political views, Geyl adopted {{the views of the}} 17th-century Dutch Louvestein faction, led by Johan van Oldenbarneveldt (1547–1619) and Johan de Witt (1625–72). It stood for liberty, toleration, and national interests in contrast to the Orange stadholders who sought to promote their own self-interest. According to Geyl, the Dutch Republic reached the peak of its powers during the 17th century. He was also a staunch nationalist and suggested that Flanders could split off from Belgium and join the Netherlands. Later he decried what he called radical nationalism and stressed more the vitality of Western Civilization. Geyl was highly critical of the world history approach of Arnold J. Toynbee.|$|E

500|$|However, {{in these}} early years, the {{trustees}} of Queen's College and the Synod of New York disagreed on {{the purpose of the}} new institution. With uncertainty about the college's financial stability, the Synod desired to directly oversee the theological training of their ministerial candidates. [...] However, the question of whether to open a seminary was delayed because of the ongoing hostilities of the American Revolution. After the war concluded, the Synod decided in 1784 that it was necessary to support the study of theology and recommenced the effort to establish a seminary. The Rev. John Henry Livingston, a graduate of both Yale College (1762) in Connecticut and the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Utrecht</b> (1770) in the Netherlands, was appointed to be the Synod’s Professor of Sacred Theology and to organize theological education at Queen's College. However, Queen's College did not provide Livingston a salary, compelling him to lecture on fees paid by the students directly. Livingston remained in New York overseeing a parish and instructing theology students through lectures given in his home.|$|E

2500|$|An L-system or Lindenmayer {{system is}} a {{parallel}} rewriting system and a type of formal grammar. An L-system consists of an alphabet of symbols {{that can be used}} to make strings, a collection of production rules that expand each symbol into some larger string of symbols, an initial [...] "axiom" [...] string from which to begin construction, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures. L-systems were introduced and developed in 1968 by Aristid Lindenmayer, a Hungarian theoretical biologist and botanist at the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Utrecht.</b> Lindenmayer used L-systems to describe the behaviour of plant cells and to model the growth processes of plant development.

2500|$|In January 2008 the Terlouw Commission {{advised the}} Boards of Utrecht and Maastricht Universities to {{continue}} to use Peter Debye’s name for the chemistry and physics institute in Utrecht, and to continue awarding the science prize in Maastricht. The Commission concluded that Debye was not a party member, was not an anti-semite, did not further Nazi propaganda, did not cooperate with the Nazi war machine, was not a collaborator, and yet also was not a resistance hero. He was a rather pragmatic, flexible, and brilliant scientist, idealistic {{with respect to the}} pursuit of science, but only superficially oriented in politics. With respect to sending out the DPG letter, the Commission [...] concluded that Debye found the situation inescapable. The Commission pointed out that the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences also took away Albert Einstein's honorary membership, emphasizing [...] the circumstances in which these decisions had been taken. The Commission stated that now, seventy years later, no judgment can be made concerning the decision of Debye to sign this letter in the exceptionally difficult circumstances in which he then found himself. Nevertheless, the Commission describes the DPG letter as an extraordinarily unpleasant fact, forming a dark page in his life history. Finally, the Commission concluded that based on the NIOD report since no bad faith on Debye’s part has been demonstrated, his good faith must be assumed and recommended that the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Utrecht</b> retain the name of the Debye Institute of NanoMaterials Science and that the University of Maastricht continue to associate itself with the Peter Debye Prize. Utrecht University accepted the recommendation, Maastricht University did not. But in February 2008, the Hustinx Foundation (Maastricht), originator and sponsor of the Peter Debye Prize, announced that it will continue to have the prize awarded. The City of Maastricht, Debye's birthplace, declared that it sees no reason to change the names of Debye Street and Debye Square.|$|E
