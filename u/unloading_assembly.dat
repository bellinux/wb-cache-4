40|$|With {{the advent}} of performance-based codes and fire safety design options, the need for {{validated}} fire resistance models becomes essential. In this paper, a one-dimensional heat transfer model is presented. The model predicts the temperature distribution across steel stud wall assemblies with either glass or rock fibre insulation in the wall cavity. A number of assumptions were made to reduce {{the complexity of the}} model. A comparison between temperature predictions and measured temperatures at different surfaces across loaded and <b>unloaded</b> <b>assemblies</b> is presented. Comparison between the predicted and measured fire resistance for non-loadbearing assemblies is also presented. The model predicts the temperature for the stud flanges on the exposed and unexposed sides that are necessary for predicting the fire resistance of loadbearing wall assemblies. Limitations of the model and future improvements are identified. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
5000|$|Lustron set up {{its first}} factory in a disused {{aircraft}} plant in Columbus, Ohio. It took until 1949 {{for the first}} house {{to come off the}} assembly line, designed by Strandlund to reduce the necessary production time from 1,600 man-hours to 350. [...] Model homes were erected in several locations around the country, including midtown Manhattan, where 60,000 visitors toured it in two weeks. Deluxe editions included several pieces of built-in steel furniture, and a combination washing machine and dishwasher in the kitchen. The company boasted of their minimal maintenance, imperviousness to fire, flood, decay and vermin, and advertised them as [...] "The House America's Been Waiting For" [...] and [...] "The House of Tomorrow". It sold homes through independent dealerships {{in a manner similar to}} automobile manufacturers. One was established in Albany; it is not clear if this was owned by Upstate or not. Dealers were required to pay Lustron in cash for the houses, then bear the costs of shipping themselves. The houses arrived on a truck specially designed for the purpose by Lustron on which the parts were stored in the order they would be <b>unloaded</b> for <b>assembly.</b> A trained crew of workers could put one up within a week.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate a potential boost pump overspeed condition which could exist on the Titan/Centaur launch vehicle after main engine shut-off. Preliminary analyses indicated that the acceleration imparted to the <b>unloaded</b> boost pump-turbine <b>assembly,</b> caused by purging residual hydrogen peroxide from the turbine supply lines, {{could result in a}} pump-turbine overspeed. Previous test experience indicated that turbine damage occurs at speeds in excess of 75, 000 rpm. Detailed theoretical analyses, in conjunction with pump tests, were conducted to establish the maximum pump-turbine speed at main engine shut-off. The analyses predicted a maximum speed of 68, 000 rpm. Testing showed the pump-turbine speed to be 66, 700 rpm in the overspeed condition. Inasmuch as both the analysis and tests showed the overspeed to be sufficiently less than the speed at which damage could occur, it was concluded that no corrective action would be required for the launch vehicle...|$|R
40|$|Correct {{duplication}} of DNA sequence and its organization into chromatin {{is central to}} genome function and stability. However, it remains unclear how cells coordinate DNA synthesis with provision of new histones for chromatin assembly to ensure chromosomal stability. In this paper, we show that replication fork speed is dependent on new histone supply and efficient nucleosome assembly. Inhibition of canonical histone biosynthesis impaired replication fork progression and reduced nucleosome occupancy on newly synthesized DNA. Replication forks initially remained stable without activation of conventional checkpoints, although prolonged histone deficiency generated DNA damage. PCNA accumulated on newly synthesized DNA in cells lacking new histones, possibly to maintain opportunity for CAF- 1 recruitment and nucleosome assembly. Consistent with this, in vitro and in vivo analysis showed that PCNA unloading is delayed {{in the absence of}} nucleosome assembly. We propose that coupling of fork speed and PCNA <b>unloading</b> to nucleosome <b>assembly</b> provides a simple mechanism to adjust DNA replication and maintain chromatin integrity during transient histone shortage...|$|R
40|$|Prior to 1980, the {{practice}} in multilevel autorack management was to load the railcars at various origin points, ship them to the destination ramps, unload them, and then return each car to the loading point where it originated. Recognizing the inefficiency of such a practice {{with respect to the}} fleet size that had to be maintained, and the associated poor utilization due to the excessive empty miles logged, a consolidation of the railcars was initiated and completed by February 1982. Under this pooling program, a central management was established to control the repositioning of three types of empty railcars for eight principal automobile manufacturers. Today, {{the practice}} is to consolidate the fleets of all automobile manufacturers for each equipment type, and to solve the distribution problem of repositioning empty multilevel autoracks of each type from points at which they are <b>unloaded</b> to automobile <b>assembly</b> facilities where they need to be reloaded. Each such problem is referred to in the railroad industry as a repositioning scenario. In this dissertation, we present two tactical models to assist in the task of centrally managing the distribution of empty railcars on a day-to-day basis for each repositioning scenario. These models take into account various practical issues such as uncertainties, priorities wit...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) p 7 is a membrane-associated {{ion channel}} protein crucial for virus production. To analyze how p 7 {{contributes}} to this process, we dissected HCV morphogenesis into sub-steps including recruitment of HCV core to lipid droplets (LD), virus capsid <b>assembly,</b> <b>unloading</b> of core protein from LDs and subsequent membrane envelopment of capsids. Interestingly, we observed accumulation of slowly sedimenting capsid-like structures lacking the viral envelope in cells transfected with HCV p 7 mutant genomes which possess a defect in virion production. Concomitantly, core protein was enriched {{at the surface}} of LDs. This indicates a defect in core/capsid unloading from LDs and subsequent membrane envelopment rather than defective trafficking of core to this cellular organelle. Protease and ribonuclease digestion protection assays, rate zonal centrifugation and native, two dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed increased amounts of high-order, non-enveloped core protein complexes unable to protect viral RNA in cells transfected with p 7 mutant genomes. These results suggest accumulation of capsid assembly intermediates {{that had not yet}} completely incorporated viral RNA in the absence of functional p 7. Thus, functional p 7 is necessary for the final steps of capsid assembly as well as for capsid envelopment. These results support a model where capsid assembly is linked with membrane envelopment of nascent RNA-containing core protein multimers, a process coordinated by p 7. In summary, we provide novel insights int...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an original teleoperated and robotized system (TRON) designed for retrieving foreign objects within lower internals of the reactor vessels at {{nuclear power plants}} (PWR). For performing these operations, the system does not require that the lower internals have to he retrieved or the fuel <b>assemblies</b> <b>unloaded.</b> The remote handler device is an articulated pole for accessing to the lower internals from the lower core plate. This cylindrical pole is capable to reach the 90 % of the horizontal surface below the core barrel. In order to carry out such mission, the TRON system {{must be able to}} underwater operate inside a very complex environment and exposed to moderate levels of radiation, that could be punctually high or very high. The design and implementation of the teleoperation system is based on generic software architecture. This original architectural model has been a very useful scheme for organising TRON control tasks, since it comprises the main functional subsystems that may appear in a teleoperation system and clearly defines the interconnections among them. The use of a generic architecture for the system development has allowed guaranteed its success. The system has been tested in one of the nuclear power plants where it will work (C. N. Asco).

40|$|Purpose: Bacterial leakage {{along the}} implant-abutment interface, with {{consequent}} species harboring the inner parts of two-part dental implant systems, {{has been reported}} in the literature. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate bacterial leakage from human saliva to the internal part of the implants along the implant-abutment interface under loaded and unloaded conditions using DNA Checkerboard. Materials and Methods: Sixty denial implants- 20 each of external-hexagon, internal-hexagon, and Morse cone-connection designs-and their conical abutments were used in this study. Each group was subdivided into two groups of 10 loaded and 10 <b>unloaded</b> implants. The <b>assemblies</b> were immersed in human saliva and either (1) loaded with 500, 000 cycles at 120 N (experimental group) or (2) incubated in static conditions for 7 days at 35 degrees C (unloaded control group). Results: Microorganisms were found in the internal surfaces of all types of connections. The Morse cone connection presented the lowest count of microorganisms in both the unloaded and loaded groups. Loaded implants presented with higher counts of microorganisms than unloaded implants for external- and internal-hex connections. Conclusion: Bacterial species from human saliva may penetrate along the implant-abutment interface under both unloaded and loaded conditions for all connections evaluated. Morse cone-connection implants showed the lowest counts of microorganisms for both conditions. External- and internal-hex implants showed a higher incidence of bacteria and higher bacterial counts after simulated loading. INT J ORAL MAXILLOFAC IMPLANTS 2012; 27 : 551 - 560.

40|$|Background: One of {{the biggest}} threat of our time is the {{environmental}} impact caused by humans, for example thru emissions of greenhouse gases. The manufacturing industry, of which the automotive industry is a part, stands for {{a big part of}} these emissions, and today companies have to face big challenges regarding measuring and reducing of their carbon footprint. To work in a successful way with the environmental impact of a manufacturing industry, process mapping and identification of environmental parameters need to be done. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study is}} to do a situation analysis by identify what parameters in a logistic flew between the activities <b>unloading</b> goods and <b>assembly</b> at Scania Oskarshamn. Furthermore, the report supposed to create and develop a model for calculation of the environmental impact of a logistic flew based on environmental parameters. Methodology: This report is a case study that have been performed at the Scania site in Oskarshamn. The report aim to create and develop a calculation model for calculation of the environmental impact of a logistic flew. Empirical material has been collected thru both interviews and by searching in Scania ́s own database. In order to create the model, a situation analysis was made by performing a process map and then environmental parameters was identified. Employers at Scania tested the calculation model, which is the result of this study, in order to secure the function of the model. Conclusions: A specific flew of goods between the activities <b>unloading</b> goods and <b>assembly</b> was identified and several environmental parameters was detected and grouped in the three categories; energy use, resource consumptions and waste. Calculations are performed in CO 2 equivalents according to the global warming potential named by UN in the Kyoto protocol. This in order to enable comparisons between the different environmental parameters. The model is performed as an Excel model because this is the program that the company use for this types of calculations, and according to the author Excel is a program suitable for the kind of model making performed in this study.  Bakgrund: Ett av vår tids största hot är den miljöpåverkan som människan ger upphov till, bland annat genom utsläpp av växthusgaser i form av koldioxid.

40|$|The Assembly Transfer System (ATS) receives, cools, {{and opens}} rail and truck {{transportation}} casks from the Carrier/Cask Handling System (CCHS). The system unloads transportation casks consisting of bare Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) assemblies, single element canisters, and Dual Purpose Canisters (DPCs). For casks containing DPCs, the system opens the DPCs and unloads the SNF. The system stages the assemblies, transfer assemblies {{to and from}} fuel-blending inventory pools, loads them into Disposal Containers (DCs), temporarily seals and inerts the DC, decontaminates the DC and transfers it to the Disposal Container Handling System. The system also prepares empty casks and DPCs for off-site shipment. Two identical Assembly Transfer System lines are provided in the Waste Handling Building (WHB). Each line operates independently to handle the waste transfer throughput and to support maintenance operations. Each system line primarily consists of wet and dry handling areas. The wet handling area includes a cask transport system, cask and DPC preparation system, and a wet assembly handling system. The basket transport system forms the transition between the wet and dry handling areas. The dry handling area includes the dry assembly handling system, assembly drying system, DC preparation system, and DC transport system. Both the wet and dry handling areas are controlled by the control and tracking system. The system operating sequence begins with moving transportation casks to the cask preparation area. The cask preparation operations consist of cask cavity gas sampling, cask venting, cask cool-down, outer lid removal, and inner shield plug lifting fixture attachment. Casks containing bare SNF (no DPC) are filled with water {{and placed in the}} cask unloading pool. The inner shield plugs are removed underwater. For casks containing a DPC, the cask lid(s) is removed, and the DPC is penetrated, sampled, vented, and cooled. A DPC lifting fixture is attached and the cask is placed into the cask unloading pool. In the cask unloading pool the DPC is removed from the cask and placed in an overpack and the DPC lid is severed and removed. Assemblies are removed from either an open cask or DPC and loaded into assembly baskets positioned in the basket staging rack in the <b>assembly</b> <b>unloading</b> pool. A method called ''blending'' is utilized to load DCs with a heat output of less than 11. 8 kW. This involves combining hotter and cooler assemblies from different baskets. Blending requires storing some of the hotter fuel assemblies in fuel-blending inventory pools until cooler assemblies are available. The assembly baskets are then transferred from the basket staging rack to the assembly handling cell and loaded into the assembly drying vessels. After drying, the assemblies are removed from the assembly drying vessels and loaded into a DC positioned below the DC load port. After installation of a DC inner lid and temporary sealing device, the DC is transferred to the DC decontamination cell where the top area of the DC, the DC lifting collar, and the DC inner lid and temporary sealing device are decontaminated, and the DC is evacuated and backfilled with inert gas to prevent prolonged clad exposure to air. The DC is then transferred to the Disposal Container Handling System for lid welding. In another cask preparation and decontamination area, lids are replaced on the empty transportation casks and DPC overpacks, the casks and DPC overpacks are decontaminated, inspected, and transferred to the Carrier/Cask Handling System for shipment off-site. All system equipment is designed to facilitate manual or remote operation, decontamination, and maintenance. The system interfaces with the Carrier/Cask Handling System for incoming and outgoing transportation casks and DPCs. The system also interfaces with the Disposal Container Handling System, which prepares the DC for loading and subsequently seals the loaded DC. The system support interfaces are the Waste Handling Building System and other internal WHB support systems...|$|R
