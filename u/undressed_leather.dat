60|$|A light shirt of link mail showed {{beneath the}} gown as he walked, {{and a pair}} of soft <b>undressed</b> <b>leather</b> riding-boots were laced as high as the knee, {{protecting}} his scarlet hose from mud and dirt. Over his shoulders he wore a collar of enamelled gold, from which hung a magnificent jewelled pendant, and upon his fist he carried a beautiful Iceland falcon.|$|E
60|$|With the panther quite evidently {{conscious}} {{of the fact that}} dissolution had overtaken it, I turned toward the girl, who was regarding me with evident admiration and not a little awe, though I must admit that my rifle claimed quite as much of her attention as did I. She was quite the most wonderful animal that I have ever looked upon, and what few of her charms her apparel hid, it quite effectively succeeded in accentuating. A bit of soft, <b>undressed</b> <b>leather</b> was caught over her left shoulder and beneath her right breast, falling upon her left side to her hip and upon the right to a metal band which encircled her leg above the knee and to which the lowest point of the hide was attached. About her waist was a loose leather belt, to the center of which was attached the scabbard belonging to her knife. There was a single armlet between her right shoulder and elbow, and a series of them covered her left forearm from elbow to wrist. These, I learned later, answered the purpose of a shield against knife attack when the left arm is raised in guard across the breast or face.|$|E
60|$|The {{next week}} {{was spent in}} riding over the estate, which {{consisted}} of four square leagues,--that is to say, was six miles each way,--and in examining the arrangements of the enclosures for the cattle. At {{the end of that}} time Mr. Hardy started on a tour of inspection through the provinces most likely to suit, provided with numerous letters of introduction from his host. While he was away the boys were to assist upon the estate, and to accustom themselves to the work and duties of the life they were to lead. Into this they entered with the greatest zest, and were in the saddle from morning till night, getting more and more sunburnt from constant exposure, until, as Mr. Thompson told them, they looked like two young guachos. The guachos are the natives of the country. They are fine-looking men, with Spanish faces. Their dress is very picturesque. They wear loose calzoncillas or drawers, worked and fringed round the bottom. Above this is a sort of shawl, so arranged that it has the effect of very loose trousers. These shawls are generally of bright colours, woven in stripes, and sometimes of black cloth edged with scarlet. The white calzoncillas show below this garment, and above a coloured flannel shirt is worn. The boots are long and are made of <b>undressed</b> <b>leather.</b> They wear a broad leathern belt, with pockets in it; in this a knife, too, is always stuck. Upon fÃªte days they come out with gay silver ornaments upon themselves and their horse-trappings. Their saddles are very clumsy and heavy, and are seldom used by Europeans, who, as Mr. Hardy had done, generally bring English saddles from home. After an absence of a month, Mr. Hardy returned with the welcome news that he had made his choice, and had bought at the public auction a tract of four square leagues, upon a river some twenty miles to the south of the town of Rosario, and consequently only a few days' journey from Buenos Ayres. Mr. Thompson looked a little grave when he heard the location of the property, but he only said that he was very glad that his friend had fixed upon a spot which would make it easy for the families to see something of each other. After the first greetings were over, Mr. Hardy proceeded to satisfy the curiosity of his hearers as to the new property.|$|E
5000|$|Hohner's {{original}} Pianet uses {{adhesive pads}} made from an <b>undressed</b> <b>leather</b> surface cushioned by a foam rubber backing. The leather is saturated with a viscous silicone oil {{to adhere to}} and pluck metal reeds. When the key is released, the pad acts as a damper. An electrostatic pickup system similar to Wurlitzer's is used. The tone produced resembles that of the Wurlitzer but brighter and with less sustain, largely owing to the design having no sustain pedal mechanism. The same firm's [...] "Cembalet" [...] uses rubber plectra and separate urethane foam dampers but is otherwise almost identical. Hohner's later [...] "Pianet T" [...] uses silicone rubber suction pads rather than adhesive pads and replaces the electrostatic system with passive electromagnetic pickups {{similar to those of}} the Rhodes, the reeds themselves however being magnetized. The Pianet T has a far mellower sound not unlike that of the Rhodes instruments. None of the above instruments have the facility for a sustain pedal.|$|E
