5|$|After {{the line}} had {{been relegated to}} a branch line, traffic fell considerably. Another factor was car traffic, which {{did not exist in}} Flekkefjord until 1918, but {{thereafter}} became widespread. After the war, Class 20 steam locomotives were used on the line. During the 1940, several railcars of Class 87 were taken into use, and soon all passenger trains were operated using such <b>units.</b> From 1956 to 1966, also Class 86 <b>units</b> were used on the line, but the narrow profile of the tunnels made operations problematic. Class 87 remained in service until 1981, when used Class 89 <b>units</b> were bought from Sweden.
