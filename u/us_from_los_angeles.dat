50|$|Before 1964, <b>U.S.</b> 60 ran <b>from</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> to the Arizona state line, {{where it}} {{continued}} its nationwide trek, often overlapping U.S. 99 and U.S. 70 along the way.

50|$|In 1928, sports agent C. C.

50|$|The highway's eastern {{terminus}} is in Virginia Beach, Virginia, {{where it}} is known as Pacific Avenue, in the city's Oceanfront resort district {{at the intersection of}} 5th Street and Winston-Salem Avenue. Its original western terminus was in <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles,</b> California, but that was moved to southwest of Brenda, Arizona to an interchange with Interstate 10 (I-10) after the highway designation was removed from California in 1964. Some US 60 signs can be seen at this interchange about 5 mi southwest of Brenda. I-10 replaced <b>US</b> 60 <b>from</b> Beaumont, California to Arizona, and California State Route 60 (SR 60) replaced <b>US</b> 60 <b>from</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> to Beaumont.|$|R
5000|$|Together {{with his}} family, Tanaka {{was sent to}} Manzanar on April 23, 1942, {{under the terms of}} the earlier {{executive}} order. Tanaka characterized the facility as an [...] "outdoor jail," [...] and he was one of what would eventually be 10,000 Japanese Americans, mostly <b>U.S.</b> citizens <b>from</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> County. Located in California's arid Owens Valley in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains, these inmates lived in crude barracks that did little to protect them from frequent dust storms and, in the winter, freezing temperatures. Tanaka reported that [...] "I cannot see how it is possible for any human being of normal impulses to be cooped up within limited confines of barbed wires, watchtowers, and all the atmosphere of internment and not be touched by the bitterness and disillusionment all around him." ...|$|R

The bridge itself is maintained by the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District instead of Caltrans.|$|R
5000|$|The airline gained press {{attention}} {{after it}} {{said that it would}} offer $249 <b>U.S.</b> dollar fares <b>from</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> to New York City. The airline announced that it would cater to family travelers who found traditional airlines to be too expensive. In June 1992 Myron Barry Michaels, the chief executive, said that [...] "For the most part, we're looking at the leisure market, although there will be some business traffic, particularly on the San Francisco-Los Angeles sector." [...] The airline announced that it would use [...] "between three and five Boeing 747-100/200s" [...] and that the first routing would go from Las Vegas to <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> to Newark, New Jersey to Miami to Las Vegas. The airline also announced that it was negotiating lease and purchase deals with European and Asian carriers involving parked 747-200s in desert areas and one involving a former Pan Am 747-100.|$|R
