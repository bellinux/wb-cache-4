There {{is no reason why}} you shouldn't have them if you will mind what I tell you--I alone--and not talk to other parties." [...] He passed his arm into that of his companion, and the two walked for some time up and down one of the less frequented corridors. Newman's {{imagination}} began to glow with the idea of converting his bright, impracticable friend into a first-class man of business. He felt for the moment a sort of spiritual zeal, the zeal of the propagandist. Its ardor was in part the result of that general discomfort which the sight of all <b>uninvested</b> <b>capital</b> produced in him; so fine an intelligence as Bellegarde's ought to be dedicated to high uses. The highest uses known to Newman's experience were certain transcendent sagacities in the handling of railway stock. And then his zeal was quickened by his personal kindness for Valentin; he had a sort of pity for him which he was well aware he never could have made the Comte de Bellegarde understand. He never lost a sense of its being pitiable that Valentin should think it a large life to revolve in varnished boots between the Rue d'Anjou and the Rue de l'Universite, taking the Boulevard des Italiens on the way, when over there in America one's promenade was a continent, and one's Boulevard stretched from New York to San Francisco. It mortified him, moreover, to think that Valentin lacked money; there was a painful grotesqueness in it. It affected him as the ignorance of a companion, otherwise without reproach, touching some rudimentary branch of learning would have done. There were things that one knew about as a matter of course, he would have said in such a case. Just so, if one pretended to be easy in the world, one had money as a matter of course, one had made it! There was something almost ridiculously anomalous to Newman in the sight of lively pretensions unaccompanied by large investments in railroads; though I may add that he would not have maintained that such investments were in themselves a proper ground for pretensions. [...] "I will make you do something," [...] he said to Valentin; [...] "I will put you through. I know half a dozen things in which we can make a place for you. You will see some lively work. It will take you a little while {{to get used to the}} life, but you will work in before long, and at the end of six months--after you have done a thing or two on your own account--you will like it. And then it will be very pleasant for you, having your sister over there. It will be pleasant for her to have you, too. Yes, Valentin," [...] continued Newman, pressing his friend's arm genially, [...] "I think I see just the opening for you. Keep quiet and I'll push you right in." ...|$|E

30|$|In this section, we {{account for}} the FVA {{reduction}} provided by the possibility for a bank to post economic capital, on top of reserve capital RC+RF=CA already included in the above, as variation margin. Note that, in practice, <b>uninvested</b> <b>capital</b> of the bank {{can also be used}} for that purpose. But, since the amount of <b>uninvested</b> <b>capital</b> is unknown and could as well be zero in the future, capital is conservatively taken in FVA computations as CA+EC.|$|E
40|$|Private {{independent}} {{limited partnership}} venture capital funds receive capital from institutional investors, without tax incentives. Limited partnership investment activities {{are governed by}} restrictive covenants that are determined by negotiated contract between the fund managers (general partners) and the institutional investors (limited partners). By contrast, Canadian Labour Sponsored Venture Capital Corporations (LSVCCs) receive capital only from individual investors who receive tax breaks on capital contributions of up to CAN$ 5, 000. LSVCC investment activities are governed by statutory restrictions. This chapter contrasts the governance of LSVCCs to limited partnerships. We also summarize Canadian evidence {{on the impact of}} LSVCC governance and tax incentives: (1) on the distribution of venture capital funding between private and LSVCC funds; (2) on the unusually large overhang of <b>uninvested</b> <b>capital</b> in the Canadian venture capital industry; (3) the portfolio size (i. e. number of investee firms per fund) of private funds versus LSVCCs; and (4) the performance of LSVCCs relative to other types of venture capital organiziations and other comparable investments for individual investors. venture capital, Canada, tax, government, crowding out, portfolio size, governance...|$|E
40|$|How {{should we}} invest capital into a {{sequence}} of investment opportunities, if, for reasons of external competition, our interest focuses on trying {{to invest in the}} very best opportunity? We introduce new models to answer such questions. Our objective is to formulate {{them in a way that}} makes results high-risk specific in order to present true alternatives to other models. At the same time we try to keep them applicable in quite some generality, also for different utility functions. Viewing high-risk situations we assume that an investment on the very best opportunity yields a lucrative, possibly time-dependent, rate of return, that <b>uninvested</b> <b>capital</b> keeps its risk-free value, whereas "wrong" investments lose their value. Several models are presented, mainly for the so-called rank-based case. Optimal strategies and values are found, also for different utility functions, and several examples are explicitly solved. We also include results for the so-called full-information case, where, in addition, the quality distribution of investment opportunities is supposed to be known. In addition we present tractable models for an unknown number of opportunities in terms of Pascal arrival processes. Effort is made throughout the article to justify assumptions in the view of applicability. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|In Hungary, the {{previously}} non-existing venture capital and private equity industry has strengthened {{over the past}} two decades, and it {{has become one of the}} leaders of the CEE region. Approximately 90 % of the capital allocated to investments overall were raised from private sector investors. The volume of VC & PE fluctuated cyclically following international capital market cycles and the changes of domestic economic policy. The Hungarian market became a preferred area for foreign capital investors in the last third of the 1990 s. Later on its position became even more favourable due to Hungary's accession to the EU. Between 2007 and 2008 the Hungarian market, similarly to the whole region, earned also profit from a transitory situation at the beginning of the crisis when the investment problems in Western Europe did not extend to the CEE region for some time. From 2009 on, however, the crisis in CEE also resulted in a very serious drop in investments, in spite of the significant amount of <b>uninvested</b> <b>capital</b> accumulated in recent years. In addition, the crisis affected the already weakened Hungarian economy more seriously than the other parts of the region, which was reflected by the drop in investments in 2010...|$|E
40|$|Hungary {{represents}} {{the second most}} developed venture capital and private equity (VC&PE) market in Central and Eastern Europe. This {{article is based on}} a detailed survey of the entire VC industry between 1989 â€“ 2010. It demonstrates that while there was a relatively strong correlation between the allocation of capital to VC&PE funds and the capital flow into the Budapest Stock Exchange, the changes in investment activities were closely related to election years. Investments had been hampered primarily not by the shortage of capital, but by a lack of demand and attractive business plans. The article illustrates the different roles and approaches of global, regional and country VC&PE funds in Hungary. It points out that VC investments hardly satisfied their principal function or mission, namely to support innovative start-up and small businesses. Government interventions in the VC market proved to be ineffective as well. Similarly to the whole region, the Hungarian market profited from a transitory situation in the case of high-value PE transactions between 2007 and 2008, {{at the beginning of the}} crisis, when the investment problems in Western Europe had yet not extended to the CEE region. From 2009 onward, however, the crisis has resulted in a drop in investments despite the significant amount of <b>uninvested</b> <b>capital</b> accumulated in recent years. As to the prospects for 2013, the early-stage VC segment in Hungary is expected to flourish owing to the Jeremie funds, while the high-value buyout segment of the market will suffer from both the euro zone debt crisis and the loss of transparency in economic policy. ...|$|E
40|$|The Inquiry Page is a {{web site}} for {{collaborative}} curriculum development. It supports a range of activities in which educators are encouraged to investigate, create, discuss, and reflect. Teachers inquire through their access to resources on teaching and learning, including quotes about inquiry teaching, articles, project links, curriculum units, and content resources. They communicate with other teachers through various online communication media. They construct their own versions of curricula using an online inquiry unit generator. They express themselves through these units and through sharing both literal and textual photos of their classrooms. Background All learning begins with the learner. What children know {{and what they want}} to learn are not just constraints on what can be taught; they are the very foundation for learning. Dewey's description of the four primary interests of the learner are still appropriate starting points: inquiry, or investigation [...] the child's natural desire to learn; communication [...] the propensity to enter into social relationships; construction [...] the delight in creating things; and expression, or reflection [...] the desire to extract meaning from experience. Dewey saw these as the natural resources, the <b>uninvested</b> <b>capital,</b> "upon the exercise of which depends the active growth of the child. " But, as Dewey recognized, schooling is not just about the individual. It is the coming together of the child's interests with those of the society. The disciplines we study in school represent centuries of collective thought as well as the interests of the larger community in maintaining itself by communicating its knowledge and values to the next generation.
