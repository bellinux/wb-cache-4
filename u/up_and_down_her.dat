500|$|The video {{begins at}} a press conference where Spears, wearing a cropped Mickey Mouse top (paying homage to her days in The New Mickey Mouse Club), is being asked {{inappropriate}} questions by news reporters, such as [...] "Is it true you banned junk food, smiles, candy, sunshine and laughter from your Femme Fatale tour?" [...] Angered by the questions, Spears replies (albeit censored): [...] "Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're cool, fuck you â€“ I'm out", referencing a scene from the film Half Baked. After leaving the press conference, Spears walks out of the building and out into the street, wearing a white leather jacket and a black skirt with matching with studded combat boots. She signs a fan's copy of Femme Fatale and then blows a kiss to a baby as he whistles the melody of the chorus. As Spears walks along the street, she flashes several men, including a policeman (played by Adrien Galo). As a criminal offence, the policeman searches Spears, feeling <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> legs, as she is bent over a car. Spears later walks away from the policeman, swinging handcuffs around her finger while he buttons his shirt.|$|E
6000|$|She found Esther {{fluttering}} <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> {{room like}} a newly-caught bird. [...] "Oh, Aunt Carey, I must go home! Please let me!" [...] she said.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was still}} casting my eye <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> silk and laces when she {{abruptly}} turned upon {{me with a}} direct question: [...] "You seldom, I suppose, go out?" ...|$|E
60|$|Noie {{looked him}} <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> with <b>her</b> soft, dreamy brown eyes.|$|R
60|$|Mary turned <b>and</b> {{looked him}} <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> with <b>her</b> {{wondering}} blue eyes.|$|R
50|$|Daily {{created and}} {{performed}} a one-woman stand-up comedy tour about the <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> of <b>her</b> career <b>and</b> life.|$|R
6000|$|But {{the captive}} paused on the {{threshold}} of the dungeon; the wanderer stood still on the brow of the last hill. Marian paced <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> own room, and thought and reasoned half aloud,-- ...|$|E
60|$|Suddenly he had {{a daring}} and {{brilliant}} smile that changed his face completely. He rubbed his palms together. He laughed as if at a huge joke. He cast a measuring glance <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> slender form.|$|E
6000|$|... "Worn out! Worn out!" [...] Madame said, nodding slowly <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b> <b>Her</b> black veil, pushed up, sagged {{over her}} brows like a {{mourning}} band. [...] "You cannot afford to waste the stamina. And will {{you keep on}} the theatre--with Mr. May--?" ...|$|E
60|$|Rilla {{found herself}} {{standing}} alone {{and listening to}} disconnected scraps of talk as people walked <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> past <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|Left {{by herself}} in the dining-room, Mrs. Wagner took a turn <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> with <b>her</b> mind bent on {{penetrating}} Madame Fontaine's motives.|$|R
60|$|She {{knows that}} it must be now or never. She has left her biggest guns for the end. In her {{excitement}} she is rising <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> on <b>her</b> toes.|$|R
60|$|But {{clearly the}} {{beautiful}} Rachel was extraordinarily agitated. At night {{she did not}} sleep, but would pace <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> apartments in a state bordering on frenzy, which of course caused M. le Marquis {{a great deal of}} anxiety and of sorrow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{write and}} {{tell us how you}} get on now and then; I like to hear about other people's good times while I'm waiting for my own," [...] said Molly, too much {{interested}} to observe that Grif was sticking burrs <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> braids.|$|E
60|$|Patsy wondered, too, {{the cold}} shivers chasing one another <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> back. The boy was coming toward them, coolly puffing a cigar. He {{did not seem}} to totter quite so much as before, but he was glad to sink into an easy chair.|$|E
60|$|Emmy {{tried to}} look through the {{telescope}} over George's shoulder, but she could make nothing of it. She only saw a black eclipse bobbing <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> before <b>her</b> eyes.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Burton {{had not yet}} {{finished}} with the subject of clothes. The distaste upon her face had rather increased. She looked <b>her</b> husband <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> eyes grew bright with anger.|$|R
50|$|In 1993, Suzanne Fisher {{published}} {{a sequel to}} Shabanu: Daughter of the Wind, Haveli. Haveli shows Shabanu as a mother at age 18 <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> of <b>her</b> new life at home, her marriage, her daughter, and her life.|$|R
60|$|While {{the women}} talked together, Fay led Johnny <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> little world, showing all her {{favorite}} nooks, making him rest {{often on the}} seats that stood all about, and amusing him immensely by relating the various fanciful plays with which she beguiled her loneliness.|$|E
60|$|Little {{he thought}} that three doors off from him, Valencia was sitting up the whole night through, vainly trying to quiet Lucia, who refused to undress, and paced <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> room, hour after hour in wild misery, which I have no skill to detail.|$|E
6000|$|... "What would Ralph Denham say to this?" [...] thought Katharine, {{beginning}} to pace <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> bedroom. She twitched aside the curtains, so that, on turning, she was faced by darkness, and looking out, could just distinguish {{the branches of}} a plane-tree and the yellow lights of some one else's windows.|$|E
60|$|He met Babbitty round a corner, <b>and</b> snapped <b>her</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> put <b>her</b> <b>down</b> again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it yours? Then {{you are my}} mamma; ain't you? You are Mamma!" [...] she {{continued}} gleefully; and before Mrs. Tretherick could avoid her, she had dropped her doll, and, catching the woman's skirts with both hands, was dancing <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> before <b>her.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Judd plays Ruby, {{the title}} {{character}} and narrator of the film. As the film begins, she is leaving Tennessee, landing in Panama City, Florida, a summer resort town she visited as a child. Although she arrives there in fall, {{at the beginning of}} the off-season, she gets a job at Chambers Beach Emporium, a souvenir store run by Mrs. Chambers (played by Lyman), overcoming the owner's initial rejection of her employment application by telling her [...] "I've done retail before, and I work real cheap." [...] Over the course of a year she keeps a journal (from which the film's narration is taken) and contemplates <b>her</b> career <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> <b>downs,</b> <b>her</b> love life, her past, and her future.|$|R
60|$|The {{reports about}} Miss Ailie's {{behavior}} {{became more and}} more alarming. She walked <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> bedroom now {{in the middle of the}} night. Every time the knocker clanked she held herself together with both hands. Agnes had orders not to answer the door until her mistress had keeked through the window.|$|E
60|$|And now {{the boat}} which has rounded Harpswell Point is {{skimming}} {{across to the}} head of Middle Bay, where the new ship can distinctly be discerned standing upon her ways, while moving clusters of people were walking <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> decks or lining the shore in the vicinity. All sorts of gossiping and neighborly chit-chat is being interchanged in the little world assembling there.|$|E
60|$|It {{was very}} risky {{to go back}} to Reddy, whom he had not seen for many weeks; but in trousers! He could not help it. He only meant to walk <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> street, so that she might see him from the window, and know that this splendid thing was he; but though he went several times into the street, Reddy never came to the window.|$|E
60|$|Right {{into the}} middle of Mr. Allan's prayer burst a series of {{piercing}} shrieks. The minister stopped appalled and opened his eyes. Every head in the congregation flew up. Lauretta White was dancing <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> in <b>her</b> pew, clutching frantically {{at the back of her}} dress.|$|R
60|$|Isen. What! could I bear {{to see my}} poor child {{wandering}} <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> wringing <b>her</b> {{hands like}} a mad woman--I who have lived for no one else this sixteen years? Guta talked sentiment--called it a glorious cross, and so forth.--I took it as it came.|$|R
50|$|Having {{admitted}} that 2009 {{has been a}} life changing year, Dannii felt {{it was time to}} put pen to paper and tell it all about the <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> of <b>her</b> 38-year life. The pregnancy and arrival of her first son, Ethan, also encouraged her to write the book.|$|R
6000|$|Her face {{declined}} and was unseen; {{her hair}} [...] Fell in long tresses like the weeping willow, [...] Sweeping the marble underneath her chair, [...] Or rather sofa (for {{it was all}} pillow, [...] A low soft ottoman), and black despair [...] Stirr'd <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> bosom like a billow, [...] Which rushes to some shore whose shingles check [...] Its farther course, but must receive its wreck.|$|E
60|$|The mysterious fire played <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> {{dark and}} rolling locks, twining and {{twisting}} itself through and around them like threads of golden lace; it gleamed upon her ivory breast and shoulder, {{from which the}} hair had slipped aside; it slid along her pillared throat and delicate features, and seemed to find {{a home in the}} glorious eyes that shone and shone, more brightly even than the spiritual essence.|$|E
60|$|Placing {{her elbows}} on the table, she slid her ruby ring <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> finger abstractedly. She frowned at the rows of leather-bound books {{opposite}} her. Ralph looked keenly at her. Very pale, but sternly concentrated upon her meaning, beautiful but so little aware of herself as to seem remote from him also, there was something distant and abstract about her which exalted him and chilled him at the same time.|$|E
6000|$|Mershone stalked <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> before <b>her</b> like a caged beast. His {{eyes were}} red and wicked; {{his lips were}} pressed tightly together. [...] "Diana," [...] said he, [...] "I've never wanted {{anything}} in this world as I want that girl. I can't let that mollycoddle marry her!" ...|$|R
5000|$|On March 21, 2016, the 16th {{anniversary of}} her debut album Da Baddest Bitch, Trina {{released}} a single entitled [...] "Overnight", discussing the <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> of <b>her</b> career including people only viewing {{her as a}} pretty face, lawsuits, and label issues {{that she had to}} deal with through it all.|$|R
60|$|The {{two women}} {{were alone in the}} morning-room of Lady Carey's house in Pont Street. Lucille was walking restlessly <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> {{twisting}} <b>her</b> handkerchief between her fingers. Lady Carey was watching her, more composed, to all outward appearance, but with closely compressed lips, and boding gleam in her eyes.|$|R
