5|$|The Australian {{contribution}} to the Battle of Normandy involved more than 3,000 military personnel serving under British command.

5|$|Along {{with the}} rest of {{south-west}} England, the Blackdown Hills have a temperate climate that is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The mean temperature is approximately 10°C (50°F) and shows a seasonal and a diurnal variation, but because of the modifying effect of the sea the range is less than in most other parts of the <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> (<b>UK).</b> January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between 1°C (34°F) and 2°C (36°F). July and August are the warmest months, with mean daily maxima around 21°C (70°F). December is normally the most cloudy month and June the sunniest. High pressure over the Azores often brings clear skies to south-west England, particularly in summer.|$|E

5|$|A {{few months}} after {{he was born in}} the village of Bani Jamra, al-Jamri moved with his family to Iraq where his father {{continued}} his religious studies. To his delight, al-Jamri returned to Bahrain in 1973 and five years later graduated from high school. In 1979 he moved to the <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> (<b>UK)</b> to continue his higher education. Between 1987 and 2001, al-Jamri lived in self-imposed exile in UK where he became the spokesman of a UK-based opposition group. Following a series of reforms of which he was initially skeptical of, al-Jamri returned to Bahrain in December 2001. He co-founded Al-Wasat in September 2002 and became its editor-in-chief since then. The newspaper, said to be the only one offering independent and non-sectarian coverage in Bahrain was a success, becoming the country's most popular and profitable. Al-Jamri writes daily columns described to be moderate and non-sectarian.|$|E
5|$|In 1944 Australia's {{war effort}} {{was focused on}} the Pacific War, and most {{elements}} of the country's military were in Australia and the islands to its north. Nevertheless, substantial numbers of RAAF personnel, most of whom had been trained through the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS), were stationed in the <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> (<b>UK)</b> and took part in operations against Germany. The Australian Government had very little influence over where Australian graduates of EATS were posted, and many were assigned directly to British units. As of 6 June 1944, 1,816 Australian airmen (including 584 pilots) were posted to RAF squadrons. Many of the thousands of Australian ground crew in the UK at this time were also serving with RAF units. In addition, ten RAAF flying squadrons were stationed in the UK. These included one regular RAAF unit, No. 10Squadron, and nine temporary Article XV squadrons, which had been formed under the agreement that underpinned EATS. While the ArticleXV squadrons were nominally Australian, most included a substantial proportion of personnel from Britain and other Commonwealth countries; as of 1 June 1944 they were manned by 796 Australian aircrew and 572 airmen from other countries. Owing to an over-supply of aircrew trained through the Empire Air Training Scheme, there were also hundreds of RAAF airmen in the UK who were assigned to personnel depots while they waited to be posted to a combat unit; prior to the invasion these unattached airmen were considered an asset by the Allied air forces as they could rapidly replace casualties.|$|E
