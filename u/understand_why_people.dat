500|$|In March 2013, UCLA {{reportedly}} offered Stevens between $2.5 and $3million a year {{to leave}} Butler. Rumors circulated that Stevens was in contract negotiations with UCLA, but ultimately the rumors proved false and Stevens stayed at Butler. Commenting on the situation, {{a source close to}} Stevens said [...] "Brad doesn't <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>people</b> would assume he's leaving." [...] A few days later, Stevens reiterated that he was very happy at Butler and had no intentions to leave as long as he had the support of the university to continue running the program the [...] "right way".|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Morse {{received}} a phone call from David Shore, having previously worked with him on the Hack series, who asked him if he would be interested in having a guest role on House. When Morse watched the show, he could not <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>people</b> watched the show, because he believed that [...] "this House guy is a total jerk". When he told some of his friends about the offer, however, their excited reactions convinced him to accept the role. Morse portrayed Michael Tritter, a detective with a vendetta against Gregory House. He earned his first Emmy Award nomination for his work on the series.|$|E

2500|$|Paranormal {{researcher}} John Champion {{writes in}} Skeptical Inquirer Magazine that he <b>understands</b> <b>why</b> <b>people</b> persist in believing that Queen Mary is haunted {{when the only}} evidence given is anecdotes, creepy feelings and shadows. Tourists who {{sign up for the}} haunted tour are given access to normally off-limit areas of the ship, while tours {{of the history of the}} ship are more limited. Champion believes that the owners are doing a disservice to the real history, the people who should be honoured [...] "by remembering who they really were and what they actually did". He <b>understands</b> <b>why</b> <b>people</b> report strange occurrences, the ship still creaks and groans, and people's imaginations can get away from them such that they start seeing and hearing all kinds of things, attributing them to the paranormal which they have been primed for. [...] "Ghost stories are fine", concludes Champion [...] "when presented as such. The confusion of science and history with fiction ... gets us further away from the ability to relish in and truly explore our own recent history." ...|$|R

500|$|Giorgio Armani, who at {{the time}} was co-chairing a Met {{exhibition}} on superheroes' costumes with Wintour, drew some attention for his personal remarks. [...] "Maybe what she thinks is a beautiful dress, I wouldn't think was a beautiful dress," [...] he said. While he claimed he couldn't <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>people</b> disliked her, saying he himself was indifferent, he expressed hope she hadn't made a comment once attributed to her [...] "the Armani era is over." [...] He accused her of preferring French and American fashion over Italian. Geoffrey Beene, who stopped inviting Wintour to shows after she stopped writing about him, called her [...] "a boss lady in four-wheel drive who ignores or abandons those who do not fuel her tank. As an editor, she has turned class into mass, taste into waste." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew Hampp {{felt that}} [...] "for an album [...] {{inspired}} by performance art, {{it was the}} one moment where music and shock value merged indelibly and credibly." [...] The performance also received criticism for the vomiting act. Recovered bulimic Demi Lovato complained that the show [...] "glamorized" [...] eating disorders. In response to the controversy, Brown told MTV News, [...] "I can <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>people</b> would make that association, but my performance is really not a statement about eating disorders themselves." [...] Gaga confessed on Today, [...] "Millie and I know that not everybody's going to love that performance, but we both really believe in artistic expression and strong identities, and I support her and what she does. Artpop, my new album, is about bringing art and music together in the spirit of creative rebellion, and for us, that performance was art in its purest form." ...|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{also held}} a one-off concert for ArtRave: The Artpop Ball inside a six-storey vending machine at Doritos' annual South by Southwest (SXSW) music festival at Austin, Texas. The city's Music and Entertainment {{division}} had initially denied permission to Gaga for playing inside the venue citing {{that it was}} for [...] "public safety concerns". Don Pitts from the division said that the venue being in close proximity with a parking lot was the reason they had to cancel Gaga's application. On March 6, 2014, {{it was announced that}} Gaga would indeed play at the venue. Tickets were sold to the fans through different competitions and challenges. Randal Lane from Forbes reported that the concert would support Gaga's Born This Way Foundation and charity events, but nevertheless opined that [...] "the way they're doling out the tickets is still crass". The concert was criticized when artist Millie Brown vomited a green liquid over Gaga during the performance of [...] "Swine" [...] from Artpop. The performance received complaints about [...] "glamorizing" [...] eating disorders. In response to the controversy, Brown told MTV News: [...] "I can <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>people</b> would make that association, but my performance is really not a statement about eating disorders themselves." [...] Gaga herself told Today [...] "Millie and I know that not everybody's going to love that performance, but we both really believe in artistic expression and strong identities, and I support her and what she does.

Fox News said, [...] "He didn't fit {{the stereotype of the}} Eastern liberal journalist." [...] Interviewed by his son on Fox News Sunday, he was asked if he <b>understood</b> <b>why</b> <b>people</b> feel a disaffection from the mainstream media.

5000|$|In Man Repeller: Seeking Love. Finding Overalls., Medine {{outlines}} {{the period of}} personal doubt that followed the social media backlash to her engagement. [...] "The ridicule paralyzed me. I <b>understood</b> <b>why</b> <b>people</b> were upset," [...] Medine recalls. [...] "I was delivering insight on fashion and projecting information onto people"..."telling them to be confident and cool and dye their hair pink when ultimately, maybe, I was doing the same things only because I had the comfort {{of a man who}} loved me behind me. And that wasn't fair." ...|$|R
500|$|In a 2009 poll by GamePro, 21% {{of voters}} chose Mortal Kombat as their {{favorite}} fighting game series, ranking it third after Street Fighter and Tekken. In 2012, Capcom's Street Fighter producer Yoshinori Ono {{said he is}} {{getting a lot of}} requests for Street Fighter vs. Mortal Kombat and <b>understands</b> <b>why</b> <b>people</b> want it, [...] "but it's easier said than done. Having Chun Li getting her spine ripped out, or Ryu's head bouncing off the floor...it doesn't necessarily match." [...] In 2014, martial artist Frankie Edgar opined Mortal Kombat has been far superior to Street Fighter.|$|R
500|$|Stevie is {{the privately}} educated {{daughter}} of rich parents, who have abandoned {{her to go}} travelling. [...] She {{is said to be}} clueless about real life, with her profile on the official E20 website describing her as generous, creative and unlucky in love, though she has a boyfriend. Although she is described as posh, Fairbank-Hynes said Stevie is not just like a posh girl in East London, but would be out of place anywhere as she is in her own world. Fairbank-Hynes opined that posh characters in Walford stand out and can bring comedy to the show. Stevie is very naive and, according to Fairbank-Hynes, [...] "away with the fairies"—the most naive person anyone could meet. However, writer Emer Kenny was worried that Stevie being [...] "away with the fairies" [...] would make her unrealistic, but said that Fairbank-Hynes made the character recognisable. Because of Stevie's naivety and her kind nature, people see this as an invitation to take advantage of her. Stevie does not <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>people</b> are cruel to her because she sees the good in them and wants to look after them, be around people and mother them. Fairbank-Hynes commented, [...] "Stevie's {{the type of person who}} thinks a stranger is a friend she hasn't met yet". However, Stevie is very forward, which can scare people away. She is also creative, empathetic and a complete daydreamer who lacks common sense but has bursts of assertiveness and intelligence, which can surprise people. Thompson said that Stevie has a good balance as she can be ditzy but also quite smart. Fairbank-Hynes identified with the character's mad outbursts, innocence and daydreaming, and also said Stevie is quirky, lovely and eccentric. Her daydreaming can lead people to believe she is a bimbo, but she is not.|$|E

2500|$|On 4 July 2007, Ahern stated at {{a conference}} in Donegal that he did not <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>people</b> sitting on the sidelines, [...] "cribbing and moaning" [...] about the economy, did not commit suicide. These {{comments}} came at a time when Ireland's economy was beginning to falter, and with property prices falling by up to 10% as part of the Irish property bubble. Ahern later accepted responsibility for the overheating of the property sector but took no responsibility for the failings of the Central Bank of Ireland.|$|E
2500|$|At age 15, after {{a series}} of outbursts in which Numan would [...] "smash things up, scream and shout, get in people's faces and break stuff", he was {{prescribed}} antidepressants and anxiolytics. Numan's wife later suggested he had Asperger syndrome; after reading about the syndrome and taking a series of online tests, he agreed, and identified himself as having AS, though he has not professionally been diagnosed with it. In a 2001 interview, he said, [...] "Polite conversation has never been one of my strong points. Just recently I actually found out that I'd got a mild form of Asperger's syndrome which basically means I have trouble interacting with people. For years, I couldn't <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>people</b> thought I was arrogant, but now it all makes more sense." ...|$|E

2500|$|Aelony was not {{completely}} naïve about segregation and first became involved in civil rights campaigns in high school. During {{this time in the}} mid-1950s, he participated in the distribution of NAACP postcards bearing the slogan [...] "Completely Free by ’63," [...] though to him this goal seemed too distant. The hatred Aelony witnessed towards the Koinonia community for practicing racial equality drove him towards participation in the Civil Rights Movement. In September 1959, he attended a ten-day CORE training seminar in Miami, Florida. The seminar focused on nonviolence training and was attended by many people involved in the Freedom Rides, including Patricia Stephens Due and her sister Priscilla Stevens. The seminar was held at the Sir John Motel, {{one of the few places}} in Miami that allowed blacks and whites to stay together. The nonviolence training consisted of techniques in organizing and training, and also emphasized the need to understand the people who were against integration. Aelony came to believe that it was important to <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>people</b> do things rather than just dividing them into categories of good and bad.|$|E
2500|$|In Ireland itself, former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern said, [...] "Some of the [...] {{papers were}} waiting to write some sensational piece about him [...] I can never <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>people</b> just don't leave things simple" [...] and one radio station owner, who called on people to write to the Mail to express their disagreement, commented, [...] "We are all very very insulted by that coverage. [...] I {{certainly}} hope the Irish people force that newspaper's editor to apologise for the great hurt caused by that article". Scotland Yard received a complaint. Gately's record company also issued a complaint to the PCC. The PCC did not uphold the complaint, stating: [...] "It found the article caused some offence but there was insufficient evidence it breached the law." [...] Tony Connell, CPS London complex casework lawyer, said: [...] "In coming to this conclusion I have paid particular attention to Article 10 of the Human Rights Act which protects individuals' freedom of expression. It is an established legal principle that this freedom applies equally to information and ideas that are favourably received as to those which offend, shock and disturb. Though the complainants and many others found this article offensive, this does not make its publication unlawful." ...|$|E
2500|$|Samantha Womack {{admitted}} that she thought the plot was [...] "implausible". She commented: [...] "I thought it was implausible. Most women who lose a child would not go out and abduct one," [...] she told the Daily Mirror. [...] "But Ronnie is a soap character {{and she is not}} necessarily representing real life. Soap is based on controversy and sensationalism because bosses are trying to get high ratings and they can't write things like 'Ronnie had a cup of tea'. Otherwise people wouldn't watch it." [...] On 1 August 2011, Ofcom cleared the storyline. The baby swap storyline prompted a huge 1,044 complaints reported to Ofcom. Ofcom also added that many of the complaints were made because the storyline was presented [...] "in an offensive manner" [...] because it [...] "appeared to suggest that a mother who has suddenly and tragically lost a baby through cot death would react by stealing another baby to replace that loss". Kym Marsh supported Ofcom's decision to clear the storyline. Marsh wrote in her magazine section: [...] "Last week, EastEnders was cleared of wrongdoing by Ofcom, the media regulator, over its baby swap storyline, and I think that's the right decision. It's just a storyline, like any other. I <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>people</b> got upset about it, but no-one meant to upset anybody. Soaps are supposed to portray real life to a certain extent, but it's meant to be high drama for entertainment purposes. I mean, how many murders can you have in one square? There's a nod to real life but, for the most part, soaps help take people out of the real world." ...|$|E
