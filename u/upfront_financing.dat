5000|$|The state's case {{revolves}} around two documents, which include an invoice from Solar Foundations Systems dated February 25, 2011, and a December 2011 letter signed by Ryan Davies, {{the former head}} of RedCo, a Utah-based company, which was the second developer on the project. According to KOIN-TV, [...] "The Davies letter reported $210,000 had been spent toward the project and that construction was progressing." [...] The Solar Foundations invoice contains details of the construction of solar arrays. The invoice was necessary to provide proof of work on the project to get tax credits from the state. The [...] "Solar by Degree" [...] project received the tax credits, but it was later shown that the company named on the invoice, Solar Foundations, does not exist. In addition, Davies claims he did not write nor has ever seen the RedCo letter in question and that his name was forged. Relying on this evidence, the state claims Shain forged both documents. Shain denies forging the invoice and claims it was given to him by someone else involved in the project. The tax credits involved were given to SolarCity, the third developer in the project, along with its financial backers. According to The Oregonian, [...] "Those backers provide <b>upfront</b> <b>financing</b> for the projects in exchange for a share of the project revenues and the federal and state tax credits, which they can use to offset their own taxes." [...] SolarCity stated, [...] "We financed and constructed the projects in accord with the requirements of the Oregon Department of Energy." [...] The company argues that the state hired Shain, and it had no knowledge of the phony documents in question, otherwise it would have not pursued the endeavor.|$|E

Investors respond to financing risk ? a forecast of limited future funding ? by modifying their focus to finance less innovative firms. Potential shocks to the supply of capital create the need for increased <b>upfront</b> <b>financing,</b> but this protection lowers the real option value of the new venture. In equilibrium, financing risk disproportionately impacts innovative ventures with the greatest real option value.

40|$|Abstract: The upfront {{transfer}} {{refers to}} the difference between the funds raised in financial markets and the funds actually invested in real economy. We provide a simple framework for analyzing a firm’s <b>upfront</b> <b>financing</b> decisions. We argue that only the irrational investors always have an increasing utility function in the upfront transfer. They irrationally invest too much in the firms that, (1). demonstrate superior pre-issue stock performance and (2). acquire large amount of capital. As a result, the irrational investors dominate in the firms with highly positive upfront transfer. On the other hand, the firms with slightly positive upfront transfer provide good financial flexibility for firms ’ investment. Moreover, the firms with negative upfront transfer tend to signal strong earning power or ample internal funds. The framework thus predicts a negative relationship between the upfront transfer and the post-issue long-term stock performance. Using 2066 firms conducting primary seasoned equity offering (primary SEO firms) and 802 firms conducting seasoned debt offering (SDO firms) between 1985 and 1996, we find strong evidence supporting the above predictions. Our extensive robustness checks further confirm our findings. One of the most important policy implications is that securities exchange authorities should limit such exploiting strategies that could hurt both firm values and investor values...|$|E

40|$|In {{the absence}} of {{financing}} frictions, profit taxes reduce investment by their effect on the user cost of capital. With finance constraints due to moral hazard, investment becomes sensitive to cash-flow and own equity of firms. The impact of taxes changes fundamentally. Taxes reduce investment because they erode cash flow and, thereby, a firm's pledgeable income available for repayment to outside investors, and not because they reduce the user cost of capital. We propose a corporate finance model of investment and derive three central results: (i) Even small taxes impose first order welfare losses on financially constrained firms; (ii) ACE and cash-flow tax systems, which are investment neutral in the neoclassical model, are no longer neutral when firms are finance constrained. (iii) When banks are active and provide external finance together with monitoring services, the two systems not only reduce investment, but are also no longer equivalent. With active banks, investment is subject to double moral hazard and the timing of tax payments becomes important. The ACE system gives tax relief at the return stage and provides better incentives than a cashflow tax which gives tax relief <b>upfront.</b> <b>Finance</b> constraints, profit tax, cash-flow tax, ACE tax...|$|R
40|$|Nonprofit Finance Fund (NFF) has {{released}} a comprehensive free {{report on the}} first 10 Pay for Success (PFS) projects that have launched in the United States. This report details how and why communities have applied this new approach to address critical social issues including early childhood education, homelessness, and criminal justice and recidivism. Pay for Success is an approach to contracting that ties payment for service delivery to the achievement of measurable outcomes. In the U. S., all of the current PFS projects have been accompanied by a form of social innovation financing, {{often referred to as}} a Social Impact Bond, in which investors provide <b>upfront</b> <b>financing</b> for the delivery of services and are repaid only if the services achieve a pre-agreed upon set of positive outcomes. The report includes a series of comparative graphics and observations on the market's development to-date. It examines project goals and project design; the partners and stakeholders involved; the underlying data, evidence, and evaluation plans; the governance and investment structures, including repayment terms and investor profiles; and project costs. To create the report, NFF drew on experience as a PFS educator, partner, and investor and conducted research using project documentation, publically available information, and stakeholder interviews. Over the past five years, NFF has conducted more than 200 PFS trainings, presentations, webinars, workshops, and convenings across the country for service providers, governments, and investors. NFF also manages the Pay for Success Learning Hub, www. payforsuccess. org, the leading national repository for education and information on Pay for Success. NFF's work on the report was made possible {{with the support of the}} Corporation for National and Community Service's Social Innovation Fund (SIF) ...|$|E
40|$|Kenya's {{electric}} power system is heavily reliant on hydropower, leaving it vulnerable during recurring droughts. Supply shortfalls are currently met {{through the use of}} expensive leased diesel generation. Therefore, plans for new generation focus on geothermal and conventional thermal sources. While these technologies offer a lower-cost alternative to leased diesel, they require large upfront capital investments in new infrastructure. I propose that grid-connected solar PV offers an alternative solution to displace expensive diesel generation, while capitalizing on Kenya's abundant solar resource and avoiding large <b>upfront</b> <b>financing</b> requirements. Coordinated operation of Kenya's extensive reservoir hydro capacity can overcome intermittency problems associated with solar generation and offer a low-cost path to grid-connected solar PV by eliminating the need for additional investment in storage. This study uses a static expansion planning model of Kenya's power system representing the years 2012 and 2017 to evaluate the feasibility of grid-connected solar PV under different price and hydrological conditions. These results reveal that high penetrations of solar PV can be integrated into the current system without increasing total system costs. By 2017 extensive planned investments in low-cost geothermal, imported hydro, and wind power will significantly reduce production from fuel oil plants and solar PV is no longer economically competitive at current prices. The 2017 analysis does not evaluate scenarios where the price of solar PV decreases, new capacity is delayed, or PV capacity eliminates the need for new transmission infrastructure required for planned generation assets. Any of these scenarios increases the competitiveness of solar PV in the 2017 system. The methodology developed in this study could be used for system level evaluation of solar and other intermittent renewables in other hydro-dominated {{electric power}} systems in Africa. by Amy Michelle Rose.

Executive Summary While the requirement for new housing in Indonesia is more than 800, 000 units per year just to accommodate new household formation, the mortgage sector only finances at the most 200, 000 of this demand, confined mostly to developer built residential schemes and high-end residences. 1 The production of houses is likely to be close to the national requirement for new housing, however, since house prices do not show signs of an overheated market. Both house-price –to-income ratios (3 to 3. 6) and increases in house-prices relative to the overall CPI are modest. Most new houses are, however, built on an individual basis by contractors and households themselves and are financed from savings, and if debt finance is used at all, it {{is in the form of}} short-term loans. Such mode of production has severe limitations in relation to the systematic provision of services and infrastructure when cities grow rapidly. Indonesia shows major signs of stress in that area. Also, the construction process is less efficient when <b>upfront</b> <b>finance</b> is not available...|$|R

50|$|The Plex Manufacturing Cloud {{is built}} on a {{multi-tenant}} architecture. Software as a service (SaaS) (also referred to as cloud application) is an application delivery model in which the user accesses software over the Internet, from anywhere, at any time. The physical location and ownership/maintenance burden {{of the system that}} actually serves the software is outside the responsibility and concern of the end users. Some IT professionals have expressed concern about moving ERP to a SaaS model. At the same time many companies have successfully performed such deployments with Plex Systems and other providers. SaaS applications are deployed atop the platform layer of the cloud computing stack. These applications tend to be sold as a subscription, shifting the burden of the software cost across the useful life of the software, and trend to be accounted as an operating expense (OpEx). This is in contrast to traditional methods that require <b>upfront</b> payment or <b>financing</b> and tend to be accounted as a capital expense (CapEx).|$|R
40|$|Mitigation {{investments}} in long-lived capital stock (LLKS) differ from {{other types of}} mitigation {{investments in}} that, once established, LLKS can lock-in a stream of emissions for extended periods of time. Moreover, historical examples from industrial countries suggest that investments in LLKS projects or networks tend to be lumpy, and tend to generate significant indirect and induced emissions besides direct emissions. Looking forward, urbanization and rapid economic growth suggest that similar decisions about LLKS are being or will soon be made in many developing countries. In their current form, carbon markets do not provide correct incentives for mitigation investments in LLKS because the constraint on carbon extends only to 2012, and does not extend to many developing countries. Targeted mitigation programs in regions and sectors in which LLKS is being built at rapid rate are thus necessary to avoid getting locked into highly carbon-intensive LLKS. Even if the carbon markets were extended (geographically, sectorally, and over time), public intervention would still be required, for three main reasons. First, to ensure that indirect and induced emissions associated with LLKS {{are taken into account}} in investor’s financial cost-benefit analysis. Second, to facilitate project or network financing {{to bridge the gap between}} carbon revenues that accrue over time as the project/network unfolds and the capital needed <b>upfront</b> to <b>finance</b> lumpy investments. Third, to internalize other non-carbon externalities (e. g., local pollution) and/or to lift barriers (e. g., lack of capacity to handle new technologies) that penalize the low-carbon alternatives relative to the high-carbon ones.

40|$|Executive Summary: When {{nature is}} viewed in {{monetary}} terms, {{is it the}} nature that is valued, or the money? And what implications does this have for ecosystems and equity, given a financialised economy that rewards money products and their brokers, and that tends towards speculative and volatile dynamics? The current biodiversity crisis is giving rise to calls for a massive mobilisation of financial resources to conserve biodiversity, and to reduce the drivers of biodiversity loss. The possibility for ‘innovative mechanisms’ to assist with resource mobilisation needs {{is included in the}} Strategic Plan for Biodiversity (2011 - 2020) of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). This has generated a fizz of interest around what might constitute ‘innovative financing mechanisms’ for biodiversity. At the same time, much attention is directed to questions of how much nature is worth, and of how this worth might be signalled through prices that move decision-making in directions that are more ecologically sustainable. The recent UN programme on The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) gives added impetus to the incorporation of monetised ecological values into national and corporate decision-making and accounting practices, and is welcomed as such in the CBD’s current Strategic Plan. Financial support for TEEB comes from the European Commission, Germany, the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Japan. Accounting for nature in terms of ‘natural capital’ and ‘ecosystem services’ also creates wealth-generating opportunities through the possibility that proxies for conserved or restored nonhuman nature can be mobilised as capital-bearing assets. This reflects a ‘Green Economy’ ideology proposing that social equity and environmental sustainability are compatible with further economic growth and entrepreneurial activity. A pillar of this ideology is the conversion of nature health and harm into capital assets that can be traded and financialised, and requires the following: Numerical representation. First, nature needs to be conceptually ‘cut up’ into units that can be represented as numbers. These numbers, often referred to as ‘metrics’, act as surrogate or proxy measures for valued aspects of ecosystems. Numerical representation reduces ecosystem complexity to create apparent equivalence and commensurability between different locations and times. Through this, trade-offs between sites of development and sites of conservation become possible. Monetisation. This is the process whereby something is conceived of in monetary terms, and thus behaves as a commodity that can be exchanged for a monetary payment. The use of metrics for turning aspects of nonhuman nature into numerical scores helps generate monetary figures for use in cost-benefit analyses and cognate economic models. As noted by economists, these can produce monetised values that, whilst useful, may be ad hoc, unreliable, and even deceptive. The state as market facilitator. Legal markets require state participation in numerous ways. In environmental markets for conservation, the state provides regulatory frameworks to generate demand, creates terms attractive to investors and entrepreneurs through tax breaks and subsidies, and can underwrite loans bound with nature assets to make these investable by the private sector. These processes enable measures of nature health and harm to become marketised, capitalised and financialised in various ways: Trading nature. Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) are considered to compensate for economic opportunity costs in contexts where environmental uses are altered so as to conserve the integrity of particular ecosystem functions. PES might take the form of relatively simple direct payments for transformed behaviour so that ecosystem service managers maintain a defined environmental good. Examples include water users paying upstream farmers not to engage in practices that might damage water quality downstream, or payments to tropical forest dwellers for the maintenance of carbon stored in trees constructed as an ‘offset’ for industrial CO 2 emissions. Many existing national ecosystem services markets are maintained through substantial government subsidies. New legislative structures also make it possible for developers to offset new environmental harms, through purchasing conservation activity on formally owned land areas elsewhere, and thereby trading environmental harm for environmental health. Examples include species and wetland mitigation banking in the USA, habitat banking in the UK, and various biodiversity offset schemes globally, all of which trade fungible units of species, habitats and biodiversity. Nature markets. The conversion of nature aspects into numerical scores associated with monetary payments enables markets in conservation indicators. To create and service these markets, as well as to facilitate ‘price discovery’ through linking buyers and sellers, voluntary market exchanges for conservation measures currently are being established by nature brokers and environmental-financial entrepreneurs. Examples include the US ‘Earth Exchange’ of Mission MarketsTM, and the UK’s Environment Bank Ltd, through which conservation credits can be traded as commodities. The prospect of financial gain from these markets is attracting large entrepreneurial investors. Bonding nature. Once elements of nature have been conceived as monetised units, they can also be leveraged as a new class of capital asset. As such, they may become the collateral for capital-releasing loans bonded with the designated monetary value of the underlying nature aspect. New environmental bond structures are suggested for the ‘frontloading’ of predicted future incomes from conserved ecosystems, which would act as collateral for loans by private investors and multilateral donors. This would connect investor finance now with infrastructural developments considered in time to enhance environmental sustainability and to generate financial returns. ‘REDD+ bonds’, for example, would permit the mobilisation of predicted future payments for expected emissions reductions provided by standing forests under the United Nation’s REDD+ mechanism (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries) to act as collateral for loans to <b>finance</b> <b>upfront</b> investments in REDD+ and other environmental infrastructure. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), the Global Canopy Programme, the Climate Bonds Initiative, Goldman Sachs and the private bankers Lombard Odier, similarly propose that through ‘forest bonds’ guaranteed by the national governments of forest-rich countries, the ‘natural capital’ of tropical forests could be ‘materialised’ to leverage finance for development from global capital markets. It is unclear who would own collateralised (i. e. pledged) ‘natural capital’ in the case of possible payment defaults. Nature derivatives. As observed for the recently created market in tradable carbon units, the big money tends not to be in the credits themselves, but in poorly regulated voluntary and bespoke over-the-counter (OTC) trades in financialised products derived from these credits. As units of conserved or restored nature are leveraged as ‘natural capital’ in environmental markets, bonds and mortgages, these might be similarly ‘securitised’ into derived money-bearing products. This could transform the risk of species extinction and biodiversity decline, for example, into speculative opportunities. It is unclear what implications this would have for the ‘underlying’, which in this case could be credits for species populations, biodiversity and habitats. These are significant in-roads into the financialisation of biodiversity conservation, that may contribute to a scaling-up of financial resourcing for the sustenance of biodiversity. But these innovations also generate concern: Conservation markets such as habitat banking require development-related ecological harm for their existence, so as to maintain the sorts of prices that might fund the conservation considered to offset development-related environmental harm. This generates a perverse situation in which ecological harm ensures market values for conservation, such that degradation is needed in order to sustain market demand for this conservation mechanism. The raising of economic rents for land areas through the enhanced monetary values commanded by credit-bearing indicators of nature health may act to displace people from land areas as governments and investors seek to ‘grab’ these new values. Such enhancement of inequity is both unethical and may amplify the drivers of biodiversity degradation by diluting the possibility of collective action in support of conservation policies. The legal and customary rights of indigenous peoples and local communities will also be impacted. Finally, conversion of complex landscapes into numerical and monetised metrics instrumentalises peoples and nonhuman natures so that these conform to a homogenising system in which money is the mediator of all value. This can displace local eco-cultural knowledge, practices and values which may be more benign for biodiversity, thereby reducing options for transferring maximum socio-ecological diversity to our descendants...|$|R
