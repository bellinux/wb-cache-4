40|$|Over {{the past}} several years, {{numerous}} official and other bodies have called for {{the imposition of a}} <b>uniform</b> set of <b>national</b> standards for Australian local government. It has been argued inter alia that <b>uniform</b> <b>national</b> standards would facilitate benchmarking and other performance comparisons across local government jurisdictions. Whilst there is undoubted validity in principle to the contention that benefits would flow from a <b>uniform</b> <b>national</b> approach to local government, these arguments nevertheless ignore the tremendous diversity characteristic of Australian local government. This paper seeks to demonstrate that local government in Australia exhibits a large degree of diversity both within and between states and territories. Moreover, we attempt to show that inexorable demographic, employment and infrastructural trends are underway which will ensure that the diversity will not only continue, but also increase. Accordingly, although the imposition of <b>uniform</b> <b>national</b> standards may seem attractive at first sight, the actual implementation of these standards seems to be neither feasible nor desirable.

50|$|<b>Uniform</b> <b>national</b> swing, or UNS is {{a system}} for {{translating}} opinion polls, which give overall vote proportions, to expected eventual parliamentary seats in a constituency based first past the post system, as in the UK general elections. Under the <b>uniform</b> <b>national</b> swing, changes in the vote proportions (swing) since the previous election {{are assumed to be}} constant across all constituencies. By applying this change to the previous per-constituency based vote proportions, a prediction for which party would have the most votes in each constituency may be made, which is then counted and totalled for a final seat count.|$|R

50|$|The {{most obvious}} {{impact of the}} nation state, as {{compared}} to its non-national predecessors, {{is the creation of}} a <b>uniform</b> <b>national</b> culture, through state policy. The model of the nation state implies that its population constitutes a nation, united by a common descent, a common language and many forms of shared culture. When the implied unity was absent, the nation state often tried to create it. It promoted a <b>uniform</b> <b>national</b> language, through language policy. The creation of national systems of compulsory primary education and a relatively uniform curriculum in secondary schools, was the most effective instrument in the spread of the national languages. The schools also taught the national history, often in a propagandistic and mythologised version, and (especially during conflicts) some nation states still teach this kind of history.|$|R
