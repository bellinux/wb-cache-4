50|$|The {{idea for}} a Human-Computer Interaction Institute {{can be traced back}} to 1967, with the {{founding}} of the computer science program at CMU. Founders Allen Newell, Herbert A.

In 1985, Bonnie John opened the first <b>user</b> <b>study</b> laboratories for faculty and student use, and the department was officially established in 1993 when John offered the first CMU course in human-computer interaction. The HCI Masters program began in 1995, the undergraduate major began in 1997 and the doctoral program, the first in the United States to offer a Ph.D. in HCI, began in 2000.|$|E
5000|$|OmniTouch is a {{wearable}} computer, depth-sensing {{camera and}} projection system that enables interactive multitouch interfaces on everyday surface. Beyond the shoulder-worn system, {{there is no}} instrumentation of the user or the environment. For example, the present shoulder-worn implementation allows users to manipulate interfaces projected onto the environment (e.g., walls, tables), held objects (e.g., notepads, books), and their own bodies (e.g., hands, lap). On such surfaces - without any calibration - OmniTouch provides capabilities {{similar to that of}} a touchscreen: X and Y location in 2D interfaces and whether fingers are “clicked” or hovering. This enables a wide variety of applications, similar to what one might find on a modern smartphone. A <b>user</b> <b>study</b> assessing pointing accuracy of the system (user and system inaccuracies combined) suggested buttons needed to be 2.3 cm in diameter to achieve reliable operation on the hand, 1.6 cm on walls. This is approaching the accuracy of [...] capacitive touchscreens, like those found in smart phones, but on arbitrary surfaces.|$|E

Other studies also report positive effects {{through the use of}} mind maps. Farrand, Hussain, and Hennessy (2002) found that spider diagrams (similar to concept maps) had limited, but significant, impact on memory recall in undergraduate students (a 10% increase over baseline for a 600-word text only) as compared to preferred study methods (a 6% increase over baseline). This improvement was only robust after a week for those in the diagram group and there was a significant decrease in motivation compared to the subjects' preferred methods of note taking. A meta study about concept mapping concluded that concept mapping is more effective than [...] "reading text passages, attending lectures, and participating in class discussions". The same study also concluded that concept mapping is slightly more effective [...] "than other constructive activities such as writing summaries and outlines". In addition, they concluded that low-ability students may benefit more from mind mapping than high-ability students.|$|E

40|$|We present GraphUnit, a {{framework}} and online service that automates {{the process of}} designing, running and analyzing results of controlled <b>user</b> <b>studies</b> of graph visualizations by leveraging crowdsourcing {{and a set of}} evaluation modules based on a graph task taxonomy. <b>User</b> <b>studies</b> {{play an important role in}} visualization research but conducting them requires expertise and is time consuming.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphUnit by replicating two published evaluation studies on network visualization, and showing that these studies could be configured in less than an hour. Finally, we discuss how GraphUnit can facilitate quick evaluations of alternative graph designs and thus encourage the frequent use of <b>user</b> <b>studies</b> to evaluate design decisions in iterative development processes...|$|R
50|$|As CSEs {{are a new}} {{technology}} just entering the market, identifying user privacy preferences and integrating Privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) into collaborative search are in conflict. On one hand, PETs have to meet user preferences, {{on the other hand}} one cannot identify these preferences without using a CSE, i.e., implementing PETs into CSEs. Today, the only work addressing this problem comes from Burghardt et al. They implemented a CSE with experts from the information system domain and derived the scope of possible privacy preferences in a <b>user</b> <b>study</b> with these experts. Results show that users define preferences referring to (i) their current context (e.g., being at work), (ii) the query content (e.g., users exclude topics from sharing), (iii) time constraints (e.g., do not publish the query X hours after the query has been issued, do not store longer than X days, do not share between working time), and that users intensively use the option to (iv) distinguish between different social groups when sharing information. Further, users require (v) anonymization and (vi) define reciprocal constraints, i.e., they refer to the behavior of other users, e.g., if a user would have shared the same query in turn.|$|E
