He particularly argued that President Obama's health care plans made maintaining the U.S.' superpower status harder, that withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq occurred prematurely while making another war there more likely, and that the initial U.S. victory in Afghanistan had been <b>undone</b> <b>by</b> government complacency though forces could still pull off a victory. He also wrote op-eds criticizing planned budget austerity measures in both the U.S. and the U.K. as hurting their national security interests.|$|E
5|$|During {{the clay}} season, Federer's {{victory in the}} Hamburg Masters final was {{particularly}} impressive, as it snapped Rafael Nadal's 81-match winning streak on clay, an Open-Era record. Federer turned the match around from a set down to sweep 12 of the final 14 games, including a final set bagel. At the French Open, some anticipated that Federer could become the first man in almost 40 years to hold all four majors simultaneously, having just resoundingly defeated young rival Nadal on clay entering the tournament. However, in {{a repeat of the}} previous year Federer played a tough four-set final against Nadal, but was <b>undone</b> <b>by</b> going 1/17 on break-point chances.|$|E
5|$|Gloucestershire {{went over}} the Pennines to Sheffield and began the next game against Yorkshire at Bramall Lane on Monday, 29 July. Gloucestershire were soundly beaten by 244 runs, a big margin at the time. Yorkshire scored 158 and 360; Gloucestershire scored 201 to claim a good first innings lead but were then bowled out for 73 and crashed to a heavy defeat. Grace batted quite well, scoring 62 and 35. With the ball, he took 2–48 and 4–128. They were <b>undone</b> <b>by</b> the bowling of Billy Bates who took 11 wickets in the match, {{including}} 7–38 in the second innings; while George Ulyett and Ephraim Lockwood both scored centuries in Yorkshire's second innings.

5|$|The {{following}} day, 13 May, the French were <b>undone</b> <b>by</b> {{their poor}} tactical deployment. They strung their armour {{out in a}} thin line between Hannut and Huy, leaving no defence in depth, which {{was the point of}} sending the French armour to the Gembloux gap in the first place. This left Hoepner with a chance to mass against one of the French Light Divisions (the 3e DLM) and achieve a breakthrough in that sector. Moreover, with no reserves behind the front, the French denied themselves the chance of a counterattack. The victory saw the Panzer Corps out-manoeuvre the 2e DLM on its left flank. The Belgian III Corps, retreating from Liege, offered to support the French front held by the 3e DLM. This offer was rejected.|$|E

The girl begs Mega Man to stop fighting her father and elaborating that Dr. Wily had kidnapped her and forced her father into building an army of robots. With Wily's plan <b>undone</b> <b>by</b> Proto Man, he steps out of the shadows. Mega Man pursues his nemesis and fights through the scientist's Wily Castle, but Wily manages to escape in the end. Mega Man escapes as the fortress begins to self-destruct, and rides home on the top of a passing train, where he is greeted by Roll and Rush.|$|E

Smith and Phil Newport briefly stabilised the innings, before Smith was <b>undone</b> <b>by</b> yet another straight ball from Terry Alderman, trapping him LBW for 66. Gooch and Barnett had been dismissed with identical deliveries. Newport was joined by Jack Russell and the pair took England past 400, but the Australian bowlers had their tails up. Newport went for a well made 36, caught hooking by Boon off Lawson, and Phillip DeFreitas lasted just 6 balls before being <b>undone</b> <b>by</b> the fourth straight one Terry Alderman, also out LBW. Russell and Neil Foster added a further 6 runs before was caught by Geoff Marsh off Lawson leaving England all out for 430, 171 runs in arrears. Terry Alderman was the pick of the Australian bowlers with 5 for 107 for the innings.|$|E

Edna discovers {{that she is}} the one who can {{maintain}} the balance between realities.

She restores the balance, but Tankerton and other Undoners she has come to know vanish, and the gaps between London and Undone are closed. Returning to her flat, she wonders if she imagined everything, but sees the gifts Tankerton gave her, and discovers she can cross to <b>Undone</b> simply <b>by</b> concentrating.|$|R
25|$|David Kronke, The Daily News of Los Angeles (April 22, 2001) — Nero Wolfe, alas, is <b>undone</b> <b>by</b> uneven {{performances}} {{and a sense}} that it's more witty and urbane than it really is. Hutton is too antic — {{he seems to be}} playing the sassy newsroom copy boy in a '30s B-picture — and his narration tries far too hard to push jokes that just aren't funny. Maury Chaykin, a normally reliable character actor, is alternately flat or rudderlessly blustery as Wolfe.|$|E
25|$|In January 1802, patriots (unitarians) {{from several}} smaller cantons met in Aargau {{to find ways}} to ensure the {{revolution}} of 1798 was not <b>undone</b> <b>by</b> the federalists, and started plotting a new coup for spring 1802. In preparation for this new uprising, several actions were planned, and after the two Vaudois delegates returned to their homes, emissaries went from village to village stirring up popular anger against the symbols of the old regime. These efforts were apparently driven by several {{of the members of the}} tribunals who had been replaced following the 1800 address, like Claude Mandrot or former cantonal judge Potterat.|$|E
25|$|The Australian openers Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden started confidently, but Langer faltered on 26, gloving an Anderson ball to Read. Ponting and Hayden found batting easy {{against a}} {{defensive}} field setting until Hayden played a foolish stroke and top-edged a Harmison ball to Collingwood. Ponting appeared supremely confident against the bowling, but was <b>undone</b> <b>by</b> the fielding when an Anderson throw found him {{well short of}} his ground, and he departed for 45. Clarke was then caught behind off a sharply rising Harmison delivery. Symonds and Hussey then batted very defensively during the rain-interrupted remainder of the final session.|$|E
