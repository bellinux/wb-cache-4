40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a method of}} controlling the reactive power injected into a medium-voltage collection system by multiple wind <b>turbine</b> <b>generators</b> such that the voltage at one bus is maintained at a specified level. The proposed control accounts for the system impedance between the wind <b>turbine</b> <b>generator</b> terminals and the point of interconnect, and utilizes an optimal power flow algorithm to dispatch reactive power amongst the wind <b>turbine</b> <b>generators.</b> This optimal power flow algorithm minimizes real power losses within the wind power plant and avoids operating conditions that violate various operating constraints. This thesis {{presents a}} 100 wind <b>turbine</b> <b>generator</b> wind plant test system and uses this test system to demonstrate the potential increased revenues occasioned by the proposed control system as compared to a system that dispatches the wind <b>turbine</b> <b>generator</b> reactive power injections uniformly.

40|$|Because of {{low cost}} and {{maintenance}} free, inductron machines {{are widely used}} as the wind <b>turbine</b> <b>generators.</b> In order to get wind energy effectively, pole-change-type induction generators are adopted. Otherwise, the pole-change-type induction generator causes the voltage dips at starting and at pole changing time. To keep the power quality, {{it is important to}} know the state change of the generator operation. In this paper a new state criterion of wind <b>turbine</b> <b>generator</b> in operation using the tower shadow effect, which is the oscillation of active power caused by a drop in rotation torque of the wind turbine when the tower of the wind turbine and the blade of the turbine overlap each other, is proposed. By using the developed method, the state of the wind <b>turbine</b> <b>generator</b> can be judged using the short period oscillation frequency of the active power of the wind <b>turbine</b> <b>generator.</b> The developed method is applied to measured data, and it is found that the developed method is effective in the state criterion of the wind <b>turbine</b> <b>generator.</b> It is also found that the moving average method is one of the efficient methods to suppress the fluctuations in the trend of error, namely, the deviation of the frequancy of the wind <b>turbine</b> <b>generator...</b>|$|R
