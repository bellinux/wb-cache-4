Proponents of this view of Calvin's Mariology have cited Calvin's commentary on [...] for support. In this verse, in which Elizabeth greeted Mary as [...] "mother of my Lord," [...] Calvin takes note of the divinity often associated with the title Lord, saying: [...] "Elizabeth calls Mary the mother of her Lord. This denotes a <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> in the two natures of Christ; as if she had said, that he who was begotten a mortal man in the womb of Mary is, at the same time, the eternal God.... This name Lord strictly belongs to the Son of God 'manifested in the flesh,' (1 Timothy 3:16,) who has received from the Father all power, and has been appointed the highest ruler of heaven and earth, that by his agency God may govern all things." [...] Proponents of this view of Calvin's mariology point out that Calvin's objection to the title [...] "mother of God" [...] had to do with the [...] "superstition" [...] of the [...] "ignorant," [...] presumably a reference to Marian veneration.

I bring {{together}} social ontology and social epistemology by considering social entities (“epistemic unities”) that are constituted by {{the holding of}} epistemic relations between their members. In particular, I focus on the relation of taking someone as an expert. Among the types of structures examined are ones with a single expert and one or more non-experts {{who may or may}} not know of each other’s situation; and ones with more than one expert, including cases in which the relation between the experts is hierarchical and cases in which it is symmetrical. These structures model a variety of social situations which can thus be given a unified treatment.

50|$|These {{considerations}} led Nida-Rümelin {{to discuss}} the relation between philosophy and Lebenswelt (life-world) and Lebensform (life-form).

We strive for coherence regarding our beliefs or epistemic attitudes, our actions and emotive attitudes. This gives us a reason to criticize any incoherencies and these incoherencies are the starting point for philosophy in general, and for ethical theory more specifically. Philosophical theory has {{to be careful not to}} leave the common ground of the human practice of giving and taking reasons. It cannot reinvent reasons; it cannot postulate some principle and deduce moral duties from it. Ethical principles can only be systematizations of a given practice of reasoning. Here, Nida-Rümelin takes the side of pragmatism in its conflict against rationalism.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to explore {{implications}} of a necessary presupposition of a theory <b>of</b> the <b>person</b> in the aims of Personal and Social Education (PSE), {{with the aim of}} furnishing a conception <b>of</b> the <b>person</b> which retains a significant concept of personal agency in light of constraints on action. From the position that the concept <b>of</b> the <b>person</b> as agent is central to the aims of PSE, it is argued that given the tension between the conception <b>of</b> the <b>person</b> as autonomous and recognition of the plasticity <b>of</b> <b>persons,</b> the justification <b>of</b> the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> suggests itself as a relevant and useful approach. This is held to provide a means of approaching issues of personhood which are central to the concerns of PSE and which also provides important insights into the some issues of agency. It is argued in the second chapter that the relation between a theory of personal identity and the aims of PSE which presuppose such a theory is best understood as one of interdependence. From this position, it is argued that the conception <b>of</b> the <b>person</b> as potentially autonomous does not necessitate acceptance of a strict identity or non-reductionist theory of personal identity. It is argued, on the grounds of internal coherence and the ideals evident in discussions of PSE, that the alternative, a continuity theory is preferable. In the fourth chapter the issue of constraints on the concept <b>of</b> the <b>person</b> and their effect on the acceptability of theories of personal identity is addressed. It is argued that certain constraints lead to the rejection of reductionism with respect to persons but do not affect the acceptability of a continuity theory or its importance. The argument supports the view that the concept of personal identity and the concept <b>of</b> the <b>person</b> are indeterminate and allow a qualified form of social ascriptivism. Implications of the conception <b>of</b> the <b>person</b> which has been argued for, are illustrated and explored in the fmal two chapters, where the discussion focuses on the use of students' autobiographical writing in PSE. The argument is made that the conception <b>of</b> the <b>person</b> argued for in the previous chapters has advantages over that contained in the traditional understanding of autobiography. Consideration of narrative and its role in making sense of experience leads to supplementation and refinement of the conceptualisation <b>of</b> the <b>person</b> advocated...|$|R
40|$|A {{standard}} {{account of}} how the sciences developed around 1900 tends to identify specialization and an increasingly strong pragmatic orientation as the driving forces shaping the sciences in this period. We want to oppose this account: Focussing {{on a number of}} inaugural lectures delivered at Dutch universities around 1900, we emphasize the prominence of integrative ideals, and the equally notable absence of references to specialization. The notion <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> upon which these ideals are based is extremely rich: the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> a <b>person,</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> education and research and unity within the system of the sciences all are aimed at simultaneously. Remarkably, this attitude is not a reactionary one, but is intimately related precisely to the emergence of new disciplines.

This leads to a number of important questions that need to be asked with respect to the dynamics of science in this period: how can the relevant notions <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> and harmony be conceptualized? and – a question not to be pursued here – how, then, did the ideal of specialization become as dominant as it appears to be today...|$|R

40|$|Rapid {{developments}} in neuroscience {{over the past}} four decades continue to receive wide media attention. Each new reported advance points to ever tightening links between mind and brain. For many centuries, what is today called mind-talk was familiar as soul-talk. Since, for some, the possession of a soul is what makes us human, the challenges of cognitive neuroscience directly address this. This paper affords the non-specialist a brief overview of some of the scientific evidence pointing to the ever tightening of the mind-brain links and explores its wider implications for our understanding of human nature. In particular it brings together the findings from so-called bottom-up research, in which we observe changes in behaviour and cognition resulting from experimental interventions in neural processes, with top-down research where we track changes in neural substrates accompanying habitual modes of cognition or behaviour. Further reflection alerts one to how the dualist views widely held by New Agers, some humanists and many religious people, contrast with the views of academic philosophers, theologians and biblical scholars, who agree in emphasizing the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>person.</b> ...|$|R
