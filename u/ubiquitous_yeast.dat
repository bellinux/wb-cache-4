40|$|The yeast Torulaspora delbrueckii is {{associated}} with several human activities including oenology, bakery, distillery, dairy industry, etc. In addition to its biotechnological applications, T. delbrueckii is frequently isolated in natural environments (plant, soil, insect). T. delbrueckii is thus a remarkable <b>ubiquitous</b> <b>yeast</b> species with both wild and anthropic habitats, {{and appears to be}} a perfect yeast model to search for evidence of human domestication. For that purpose, we developed eight microsatellite markers that were used for the genotyping of 110 strains from various substrates and geographical origins. Microsatellite analysis showed four genetic clusters: two groups contained most nature strains from Old World and Americas respectively, and two clusters were associated with winemaking and other bioprocesses. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) confirmed that human activities significantly shaped the genetic variability of T. delbrueckii species. Natural isolates are differentiated on the basis of geographical localisation, as expected for wild population. The domestication of T. delbrueckii probably dates back to the Roman Empire for winemaking (, 1900 years ago), and to the Neolithic era for bioprocesses (, 4000 years ago). Microsatellite analysis also provided valuable data regarding the life-cycle of the species, suggesting a mostly diploid homothallic life.

We developed a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme with five retained loci (NUP 116, URA 1, URA 3, SAPT 4 and PLB 3) which were sufficiently divergent to distinguish 40 sequence types (STs) among the 67 G. candidum strains tested. Phylogenetic analyses defined five main clades; one clade was restricted to environmental isolates, three other clades included distinct environmental isolates and dairy strains, while the fifth clade comprised 34 strains (13 STs), among which all but two were isolated from milk, cheese or the dairy environment. These findings suggest an adaptation to the dairy ecosystems by a group of specialized European G. candidum strains. In addition, we developed a polymerase chain reaction inter-long terminal repeat scheme, a fast and reproducible random amplification of polymorphic DNA-like method for G. candidum, to type the closely related dairy strains, which could not be distinguished by MLST. Overall, our findings distinguished two types of dairy strains, one forming a homogeneous group with little genetic diversity, and the other more closely related to environmental isolates. Neither regional nor cheese specificity was observed in the dairy G. candidum strains analysed.

Intracellular growth was accompanied by the accumulation of polysaccharide-filled vesicles in the macrophage. Studies with fluorescently labeled dextran revealed that the phagolysosomal compartment became leaky during the course of intracellular infection. Consistent with this observation, phagosomes containing CN had an increased pH relative to similar phagosomes containing inert magnetic beads, as indicated by a colorimetric change in the pH-sensitive Lysosensor dye. Immunocytochemistry revealed differences in the reactivity of polysaccharide elaborated by CN inside macrophages relative to that expressed in vitro. Taken together these results are suggestive of a novel mechanism of intracellular survival by an encapsulated organism, whereby ingestion is followed by damage to the phagosomal membrane resulting in continuity with the cytoplasm, accumulation of polysaccharide-containing vesicles, and possibly, production of a structurally different polysaccharide...|$|R
40|$|This is {{an updated}} paper {{focusing}} on the general epidemiological aspects of Rhodotorula in humans, animals, and the environment. Previously considered nonpathogenic, Rhodotorula species have emerged as opportunistic pathogens that {{have the ability to}} colonise and infect susceptible patients. Rhodotorula species are <b>ubiquitous</b> saprophytic <b>yeasts</b> that can be recovered from many environmental sources. Several authors describe the isolation of this fungus from different ecosystems, including sites with unfavourable conditions.

Among the few references to the pathogenicity of Rhodotorula spp. in animals, there are several reports of an outbreak of skin infections in chickens and sea animals and lung infections and otitis in sheep and cattle. Most of the cases of infection due to Rhodotorula in humans were fungemia associated with central venous catheter (CVC) use. The most common underlying diseases included solid and haematologic malignancies in patients who were receiving corticosteroids and cytotoxic drugs, the presence of CVC, and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Unlike fungemia, some of the other localised infections caused by Rhodotorula, including meningeal, skin, ocular, peritoneal, and prosthetic joint infections, are not necessarily linked to the use of CVCs or immunosuppression...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Cryptococcosis is an {{opportunistic}} infection {{due to the}} <b>ubiquitous</b> <b>yeast</b> Cryptococcus neoformans.

To address the question of dormancy, we studied C. neoformans infection at the macrophage level (in vitroH 99 -macrophage interaction) and at the organ level in a murine model of cryptococcosis. We analyzed the diversity of yeast adapta-tion to the host by characterizing several C. neoformans populations with new assays based on flow cytometry (quantitative flow cytometry, multispectral imaging flow cytometry, sorting), microscopy (dynamic imaging), and gene expression analysis. On the basis of parameters of multiplication and stress response, various populations of yeast cells were observed over time in vivo and in vitro. Cell sorting allowed the identification of a subpopulation that was less prone to grow under standard conditions than the other populations, with growth enhanced by the addition of serum. Gene expression analysis revealed that this population had specific metabolic characteristics that could reflect dormancy. Our data suggest that dormant yeast cells could exist in vitro and in vivo.

This yeast is able to proliferate and survive in the intracellular environment. C. neoformans causes cryptococcosis, and yeast dormancy in humans has been suggested on the basis of epidemiological evidence obtained years ago. By studying an in vitro model of yeast-macrophage interaction and murine models of cryptococcosis, we observed that yeast cells evolve in heterogeneous populations during infection on the basis of global metabolic activity. We compared the growth ability and gene expression of yeast cells belonging to various populations in those two models. We eventually found a population of yeast cells with low metabolism that fit some of the criteria for dormant cells.

40|$|Cryptococcosis is an {{opportunistic}} infection {{due to the}} <b>ubiquitous</b> <b>yeast</b> Cryptococcus neoformans. This pathogen is a facultative intracellular organism. Interaction with immune cells including monocytes/macrophages lineage and dendritic cells are of major importance in {{the natural history of}} the infection. In humans, the pathophysiology of the infection evolves in three steps (i) primoinfection in childhood, (ii) dormancy, demonstrated from epidemiological and genotypic data in the lab few years ago (Garcia-Hermoso et al. 1999), (iii) reactivation upon immunosuppression. In terms of disease, clinical presentation and outcome of cryptococcosis are known to be diverse among individuals even those sharing the same underlying diseases. To address the question of the impact of fungal diversity on the natural course of the infection at the macrophage-level (standardized model of yeasts/ j 774 macrophages in vitro interaction), murine model-level (murine model of cryptococcosis in OF 1 outbred mice) and human-level (CryptoA/D database), we studied (i) the diversity of C. neoformans/macrophages interactions using well characterized clinical isolates (ii) the correlation between in vitro phenotype of the isolate and clinical outcome in humans (iii) the diversity of adaptation to the host. We developed new assays and new tools using flow cytometry I (quantitative flow cytometry, multispectral imaging flow cytometry, sorting), microscopy (dynamic imaging), gene expression analysis (single-cell quantitative real time PCR) to overcome technical issues. We found high variation in phagocytic, 2 hours-, 48 hours-intracellular proliferation indexes among the 54 ClinCn compared to H 99. No correlation with the genotype was observed. The lack of sterilization at week 2 despite active antifungal therapy was significantly associated with a lower phagocytic index, whereas treatment failure at month 3 and death from cryptococcosis were significantly related to a higher 2 hours-intracellular proliferation. Among 9 selected clinical isolates compared to H 99, (i) the virulence in mice was significantly different, intracellular expression of some virulence factors correlated with (ii) intracellular proliferation and (iii) phagocytic indexes. With a focus on multiplication and stress response and considering the H 99 reference strain, we observed the appearance of various populations of yeasts during mice and macrophage infections. After sorting yeasts populations, we observed that a specific one was less prone and dependent of serum to grow compared to the other p'opulations. Gene expression analysis revealed that this population had specific metabolic characteristics that could reflect dormancy. We found a high diversity of C. neoformans upon interaction with macrophages considering 54 clinical isolates in correlation with clinical outcome in humans, but also a considerable adaptation to host in our two models considering the reference strains H 99. We observed also even more diversity of fungal adaptation to host when clinical isolates were considered. Ail together, these data suggest that cryptococcosis and fungal disease in general could be more complex diseases since diversity, plasticity and adaptation of the fungal organism to hosts is high and heterogeneous. La cryptococcose est une infection opportuniste causée par la levure ubiquitaire Cryptococcus neoformans. L'interaction avec les macrophages est importante pour le développement de la maladie chez l'homme. La physiopathologie évolue en trois étapes: (i) primo-infection, (ii) dormance, (iii) réactivation en cas d'immunodépression cellulaire. La présentation clinique et l'évolution de la cryptococcose sont variables en fonction des individus. L'objectif de mon travail était de comprendre l'impact de la diversité de la levure sur l'évolution de l'infection. Nous avons étudiés (i) les souches cliniques et leur diversité d'interaction avec les macrophages; (ii) la corrélation entre le phénotype in vitro et l'évolution clinique de l'infection chez l'homme; (iii) la diversité d'adaptation à l'hôte. Ainsi, nous avons développés de nouveaux outils (cytométrie de flux quantitative, microscopie en temps réel, single-cell quantitative PCR) pour permettre l'analyse de populations de levures rares. Nous avons trouvés une grande variabilité d'interaction de 54 isolats cliniques avec le macrophage. L'échec mycologique et la mortalité chez l'homme était associés à des phénotypes d'interaction particuliers. A partir de l'analyse de 9 isolats cliniques, nous avons pu mettre en évidence que la virulence des isolats et l'expression de certains gènes de virulence connus étaient variables également. En nous focalisant sur la réponse au stress et la prolifération, nous avons observé l'apparition de différentes populations au cours de l'infection. Après tri des différentes populations, nous avons identifié une population ayant une faible réponse au stress et montré qu'elle était potentiellement dormante.

Escherichia coli was highly sensitive to patulin, but insensitive to desoxypatulinic acid. This was utilized to develop a detection test for patulin, replacing time-consuming thin layer chromatography or high-performance liquid chromatography. Two assays for patulin degradation were developed, one in liquid medium and the other in semi-solid medium. Both assays allow the contemporary screening of a large number of samples. The liquid medium assay utilizes 96 -well microtiter plates and was optimized for using a minimum of patulin.

40|$|Cryptococcus neoformans is a <b>ubiquitous,</b> {{saprobic}} <b>yeast</b> and {{the cause}} of life-threatening infections. Humans acquire the infection by inhaling airborne cells from the environment. In the lungs, these cells become encapsulated yeasts and proliferate. In people with healthy immune responses, the infection may resolve or remain latent and subsequently cause disease. However, in immunocompromised people, such as HIV/AIDS patients, and less often in healthy hosts, the yeasts can disseminate to almost any part of the body; however, they are neurotropic, and meningoencephalitis is the most frequent and deadliest clinical manifestation [1 – 3]. An estimated 1 million new infections are acquired each year, and the majority of these cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa, which has the highest prevalence of patients with HIV/ AIDS [4]. In this region, C. neoformans is {{the most common cause of}} meningitis, and mortality hovers around 50 %. Others who succumb to cryptococcosis are apparently immunocompetent and exhibit no evidence of underlying disease.

There are two varieties, C. neoformans var. grubii (Cng) and C. neoformans var. neoformans (Cnn), which are distinguishable by molecular markers or their capsular serotypes, A or D, respectively. Diploid AD hybrids also occur in the environment and patients [6 – 8]. In addition, a sibling species, Cryptococcus gattii, causes similar infections.

Nineteen S. cerevisiae isolates obtained from patients suffering from vaginitis and four isolates from commercial products in the same city were analyzed. The cellular DNA from each isolate was digested with the restriction endonuclease EcoRI, and restriction fragment length polymorphisms were generated by horizontal gel electrophoresis. The results showed that although vaginal isolates did not cluster in any particular genetic subtype, multiple patients were infected with indistinguishable strains (there were nine distinct strains among 23 isolates). For two of three patients, all three with two episodes of S. cerevisiae vaginitis, different strains were isolated during the recurrence of this disease. Three other patients with indistinguishable isolates were epidemiologically related in that two were practitioners in the same clinic and the third was a patient at this clinic. We also found that one commercial strain was indistinguishable from the strain isolated from three different women at the time that they were suffering from vaginitis. The findings of the present study suggest that some S. cerevisiae strains may possess properties permitting persistence in the human host. Furthermore, person-to-person contact and the proliferation of the use of S. cerevisiae as a health-food product, in home baking, and in home brewing may be a contributing factor in human colonization and infection with this organism...|$|R

These include the lack of a canonical TATA box in the - 20 to - 30 region and a remarkably similar 12 -nucleotide pyrimidine sequence (CTTCCYTYYTC) that spans the cap site and is flanked by C + G-rich sequences. The nature of the other members of the S 16 family was evaluated by three types of experiment: a DNase I sensitivity analysis to measure the extent of chromatin condensation; an analysis of the thermal stability of cDNA-gene hybrids to estimate the extent of divergence of each gene sequence from that of the expressed gene; and a restriction fragment analysis which distinguishes intron-containing genes from intronless processed genes. The results of these analyses show that all genes except the expressed S 16 gene are in a condensed chromatin configuration associated with transcriptional quiescence; that most of the genes within the S 16 family have sequences greater than 7 % divergent from the expressed S 16 gene; and that at least 7 of the 10 S 16 genes lack introns. We conclude that the ribosomal protein S 16 multigene family contains one expressed intron-containing gene and nine inactive pseudogenes, most or all of which are of the processed type...|$|R
40|$|Candida albicans is an {{opportunistic}} pathogen that proliferates in {{the intestinal}} tract of critically ill patients where {{it continues to}} be a major cause of infectious-related mortality. The precise cues that shift intestinal C. albicans from its <b>ubiquitous</b> indolent colonizing <b>yeast</b> form to an invasive and lethal filamentous form remain unknown. We have previously shown that severe phosphate depletion develops in the intestinal tract during extreme physiologic stress and {{plays a major role in}} shifting intestinal Pseudomonas aeruginosa to express a lethal phenotype via conserved phosphosensoryphosphoregulatory systems. Here we studied whether phosphate dependent virulence expression could be similarly demonstrated for C. albicans. C. albicans isolates from the stool of critically ill patients and laboratory prototype strains (SC 5314, BWP 17, SN 152) were evaluated for morphotype transformation and lethality against C. elegans and mice during exposure to phosphate limitation. Isolates ICU 1 and ICU 12 were able to filament and kill C. elegans in a phosphate dependent manner. In a mouse model of intestinal phosphate depletion (30 % hepatectomy), direct intestinal inoculation of C. albicans caused mortality that was prevented by oral phosphate supplementation. Prototype strains displayed limited responses to phosphate limitation; however, the pho 4 D mutant displayed extensive filamentation during low phosphate conditions compared to its isogenic parent strain SN 152, suggesting that mutation in the transcriptional factor Pho 4 p may sensitize C. albicans to phosphate limitation. Extensive filamentation was also observed in strain ICU 12 suggesting that thi...|$|R
40|$|Natural wines”, nowadays, could appear an evocative recall to what {{wine was}} like before. During the ages, science allowed winemakers to produce wines {{with the full}} control of {{vinification}} condition, obtained mainly by addition of exogenous components, supplements and microorganisms. Contrarily, “natural wine” come back to basics and simplicity as invasive operations are avoided; but, on the other hand, a deeper knowledge and monitoring of winemaking process is required, {{in order to obtain}} high quality products without exogenous substances. Natural wine has been produced by spontaneous fermentation of must by yeasts originated from grapes and winery equipment. The wide variety of natural yeasts reflects the biodiversity, which is still under-exploited despite the large use of commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae in most grape musts. During fermentation, several strains compete in the same fermenting must, and the dominance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae takes place when it overcomes all the others. The aim was to investigate Saccharomyces cerevisiae diversity and its technological behavior in two biodynamic wine farms in Tuscany. Autochthonous S. cerevisiae from Syrah fermentations were isolated and molecularly characterized in 2009 and 2013 harvests. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were isolated starting from Syrah musts with zero or low levels of sulphite added, according with the tendency of natural wines producers to abait every invasive operation during wine making. Samples were collected in different steps of winemaking. ITS-PCR method confirmed isolates belong to Saccharomyces sensu stricto complex. The multiplex PCR amplification of microsatellite loci (SC 8132 X, YOR 267 C and SCPTSY 7) discriminated S. cerevisiae strains. Genetically diverse S. cerevisiae strains were subsequently subjected to technological characterization. Micro-fermentations were set up to study fitness and quality traits of biotypes characterized. Weight loss kinetics were measured and chemical analyses were performed. Collected Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were tested also in order to verify the effect of low sulphite additions on biodiversity pursuing information about stress-adaptation mechanisms that allow the survival in the challenging environment of fermenting must. Sulphite addition may act as a selective factor to induce the presence and the activity of strains with diverse features about sulphite metabolism. The addition of different dose of sulphite induced a considerable variability among strains. However, some biotypes exhibited tolerance to certain concentration and only one biotype was classified as resistant to a determinate concentration. In addition, biotypes were subjected to an other environmental stress factor such as ethanol. The increasing of levels of ethanol limited considerably the activity of selected strains, but some of them highlighted a positive tolerance to various ethanol concentrations. During the harvest of 2013, the alcoholic fermentation was conducted inoculating a biotype characterized previously, which expressed good fermentative performance and a multi-strains culture of other S. cerevisiae strains characterized in the same harvest (2009) in a biodynamic farm from a workgroup of Edmund Mach Foundation of San Michele all'Adige (TN). The results of 2009 highlighted peculiar behaviors of 13 biotypes (characterized from four hundred isolates) that dominate the spontaneous fermentations. Not surprisingly, some biotypes were also found in fermentations of 2013, demonstrating <b>yeasts</b> are <b>ubiquitous</b> in that environment. Sensorial analyses of wine, originated by biotypes fermentation, revealed certain diversity in aroma and flavor traits, but also in the structure. Overall, this work suggests the consolidate relationship existing between autochthonous yeasts and the terroir, where <b>yeasts</b> are <b>ubiquitous.</b> Furthermore, autochthonous <b>yeasts</b> surely contribute to the unique identity of wine. In addition, this work suggests that the use of isolated and characterized autochthonous yeast strains could help the winemaking process, where the vintage could be inadequate to develop a particular product such as the wine of a specific wine farm...|$|R
