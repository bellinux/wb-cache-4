25|$|Maximum Principal Stress Theory – by W.J.M Rankine(1850). Yield {{occurs when}} the largest {{principal}} stress exceeds the <b>uniaxial</b> tensile yield strength. Although this criterion allows for a quick and easy comparison with experimental data it is rarely suitable for design purposes. This theory gives good predictions for brittle materials.|$|E
25|$|The LCD {{backlight}} {{systems are}} made highly efficient by applying optical {{films such as}} prismatic structure to gain the light into the desired viewer directions and reflective polarizing films that recycle the polarized light that was formerly absorbed by the first polarizer of the LCD (invented by Philips researchers Adrianus de Vaan and Paulus Schaareman), generally achieved using so called DBEF films manufactured and supplied by 3M. These polarizers consist of a large stack of <b>uniaxial</b> oriented birefringent films that reflect the former absorbed polarization mode of the light. Such reflective polarizers using <b>uniaxial</b> oriented polymerized liquid crystals (birefringent polymers or birefringent glue) are invented in 1989 by Philips researchers Dirk Broer, Adrianus de Vaan and Joerg Brambring. The combination of such reflective polarizers, and LED dynamic backlight control make today's LCD televisions far more efficient than the CRT-based sets, leading to a worldwide energy saving of 600 TWh (2017), equal to 10% of the electricity consumption of all households worldwide or equal to 2 times the energy production of all solar cells in the world.|$|E
25|$|The two {{refractive}} indices can {{be determined}} using the index ellipsoids for given directions of the polarization. Note that for biaxial crystals the index ellipsoid {{will not be an}} ellipsoid of revolution ("spheroid") but is described by three unequal principle refractive indices nα, nβ and nγ. Thus there is no axis around which a rotation leaves the optical properties invariant (as there is with <b>uniaxial</b> crystals whose index ellipsoid is a spheroid).|$|E
25|$|<b>Uniaxial</b> {{birefringence}} {{is classified}} as positive when the extraordinary index of refraction ne {{is greater than the}} ordinary index no. Negative birefringence means that Δn = ne − no is less than zero. In other words, the polarization of the fast (or slow) wave is perpendicular to the optic axis when the birefringence of the crystal is positive (or negative, respectively). In the case of biaxial crystals, all three of the principal axes have different refractive indices, so this designation does not apply. But for any defined ray direction one can just as well designate the fast and slow ray polarizations.|$|E
25|$|A {{material}} is termed <b>uniaxial</b> {{when it has}} a single direction of symmetry in its optical behavior, which we term the optic axis. It {{also happens to be}} the axis of symmetry of the index ellipsoid (a spheroid in this case). The index ellipsoid could still be described according to the refractive indices, nα, nβ and nγ, along three coordinate axes, however in this case two are equal. So if nα = nβ corresponding to the x and y axes, then the extraordinary index is nγ corresponding to the z axis, which is also called the optic axis in this case.|$|E
25|$|The {{microscopic}} {{model and}} most optical properties of ensembles of the N-V− centers have been firmly {{established in the}} 1970s based on the optical measurements combined with <b>uniaxial</b> stress and on the electron paramagnetic resonance. However, a minor error in EPR results (it was assumed that illumination is required to observe N-V− EPR signals) resulted in the incorrect multiplicity assignments in the energy level structure. In 1991 it was shown that EPR can be observed without illumination, which established the energy level scheme shown above. The magnetic splitting in the excited state has been measured only recently.|$|E
25|$|Dry bone {{exhibits}} some piezoelectric properties. Studies of Fukada et al. {{showed that}} these are not due to the apatite crystals, which are centrosymmetric, thus non-piezoelectric, but due to collagen. Collagen exhibits the polar <b>uniaxial</b> orientation of molecular dipoles in its structure and can be considered as bioelectret, a sort of dielectric material exhibiting quasipermanent space charge and dipolar charge. Potentials are thought to occur when a number of collagen molecules are stressed in the same way displacing significant numbers of the charge carriers from the inside {{to the surface of the}} specimen. Piezoelectricity of single individual collagen fibrils was measured using piezoresponse force microscopy, and it was shown that collagen fibrils behave predominantly as shear piezoelectric materials.|$|E
25|$|Self-assembly of nanofibrous {{scaffolds}} is able {{to occur}} only when the fibers themselves are engineered for self-assembly. One common way to drive the self-assembly of scaffold fibers is to use amphiphilic peptides so that in water the hydrophobic moiety drives the self-assembly. Carefully calculated engineering of the amphiphilic peptides allows for precise control over the self-assembled matrix. Self-assembly {{is able to}} create both ordered and unordered topographies. Phillips et al. (2005) developed and tested in vitro and in vivo a self-aligned collagen-Schwann cell matrix, which allowed DRG neurite extension alignment in vitro. Collagen gels have been used extensively as substrates for three-dimensional tissue culture. Cells are able to form integrin-mediated attachments with collagen, which initiates cytoskeleton assembly and cell motility. As cells move along the collagen fibers they generate forces that contract the gel. When the collagen fibers are tethered at both ends, cell-generated forces create <b>uniaxial</b> strain, causing the cells and collagen fibers to align. The advantages of this matrix are its simplicity and speed of preparation. Soluble plasma fibronectin can also self-assemble into stable insoluble fibers when put under direct mechanical shearing within a viscous solution. Phillips et al. (2004) investigated a new method of shear aggregation that causes an improved aggregation. The mechanical shearing was created by dragging out a 0.2 ml bolus to 3cm with forceps; fibronectin aggregates into insoluble fibers at the rapidly moving interface in an ultrafiltration cell. The proposed mechanism for this fiber aggregation is protein extension and elongation under mechanical shear force, which leads to lateral packing and protein aggregation of fibers. Phillips et al. showed that mechanical shear produced by stretching a high viscosity fibronectin gel causes substantial changes in its structure and that when applied through <b>uniaxial</b> extension, a viscous fibronectin gel forms oriented fibrous fibronectin aggregates; additionally, the fibrous aggregates have a decreased solubility and can support the various cell types in vitro.|$|E

[...] The difference in these three methods lies in the boundaries imposed into the test specimens. [...] <b>Uniaxial</b> tests do not provide lateral restraint during testing and thus tests the sample under <b>uniaxial</b> stress conditions.

[...] The multiaxial tensile test provides a plane stress boundary condition {{at the edges of}} the sample.

2500|$|The best {{characterized}} birefringent {{materials are}} crystals. Due to their specific crystal structures their refractive indices are well defined.

Standard ellipsometry is also sufficient for optically <b>uniaxial</b> samples in the special case, when the optical axis is aligned parallel to the surface normal. In all other cases, when s polarized light is converted into p polarized light and/or vice versa, the generalized ellipsometry approach must be applied. [...] Examples are arbitrarily aligned, optically <b>uniaxial</b> samples, or optically biaxial samples.|$|E

2500|$|Much of {{the work}} {{involving}} polarization preceded the understanding of light as a transverse electromagnetic wave, and this has affected some terminology in use. Isotropic materials have symmetry in all directions and the refractive index {{is the same for}} any polarization direction. An anisotropic material is called [...] "birefringent" [...] because it will generally refract a single incoming ray in two directions, which we now understand correspond to the two different polarizations. This is true of either a <b>uniaxial</b> or biaxial material.|$|E
2500|$|In a <b>uniaxial</b> material, one ray behaves {{according}} to the normal law of refraction (corresponding to the ordinary refractive index), so an incoming ray at normal incidence remains normal to the refracting surface. However, as explained above, the other polarization can be deviated from normal incidence, which cannot be described using the law of refraction. This thus {{became known as the}} extraordinary ray.

Young's modulus is also used in order to predict the deflection that will occur in a statically determinate beam when a load is applied at a point in between the beam's supports. Other elastic calculations usually require the use of one additional elastic property, such as the shear modulus, bulk modulus or Poisson's ratio. Any two of these parameters are sufficient to fully describe elasticity in an isotropic material.|$|E
2500|$|Heavy damping {{mechanism}} {{incorporated in}} vibration control technologies and, particularly, in base isolation devices, is often considered a valuable source of suppressing vibrations thus enhancing a building's seismic performance. However, for the rather pliant {{systems such as}} base isolated structures, with a relatively low bearing stiffness but with a high damping, the so-called [...] "damping force" [...] may turn out the main pushing force at a strong earthquake. [...] The video shows a Lead Rubber Bearing being tested at the UCSD Caltrans-SRMD facility. The bearing is made of rubber with a lead core. It was a <b>uniaxial</b> test in which the bearing was also under a full structure load. Many buildings and bridges, both in New Zealand and elsewhere, are protected with lead dampers and lead and rubber bearings. Te Papa Tongarewa, the national museum of New Zealand, and the New Zealand Parliament Buildings have been fitted with the bearings. Both are in Wellington which sits on an active fault.|$|E
2500|$|However {{materials}} {{in which all}} three refractive indices are different are termed biaxial and {{the origin of this}} term is more complicated and frequently misunderstood. In a <b>uniaxial</b> crystal, different polarization components of a beam will travel at different phase velocities, except for rays in the direction of what we call the optic axis. Thus the optic axis has the particular property that rays in that direction do not exhibit birefringence, with all polarizations in such a beam experiencing the same index of refraction. It is very different when the three principal refractive indices are all different; then an incoming ray in any of those principle directions will still encounter two different refractive indices. But it turns out that there are two special directions (at an angle to all of the 3 axes) where the refractive indices for different polarizations are again equal. For this reason, these crystals were designated as biaxial, with the two [...] "axes" [...] in this case referring to ray directions in which propagation does not experience birefringence.|$|E
2500|$|When {{those two}} {{propagation}} constants are equal then the effective refractive index {{is independent of}} polarization, and there is consequently no birefringence encountered by a wave traveling in that particular direction. For a <b>uniaxial</b> crystal, this is the optic axis, the z direction {{according to the above}} construction. But when all three refractive indices (or permittivities), nx, ny and nz are distinct, it can be shown that there are exactly two such directions (where the two ellipsoids intersect); these directions are not at all obvious and do not lie along any of the three principal axes (x, y, and z according to the above convention). Historically that accounts {{for the use of the}} term [...] "biaxial" [...] for such crystals, as the existence of exactly two such special directions (considered [...] "axes") was discovered well before polarization and birefringence were understood physically. However these two special directions are generally not of particular interest; biaxial crystals are rather specified by their three refractive indices corresponding to the three axes of symmetry.|$|E
