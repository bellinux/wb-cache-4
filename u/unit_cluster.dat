40|$|We {{present an}} IR study of high-redshift galaxy {{clusters}} with the MIPS {{camera on the}} Spitzer Space Telescope. Employing a sample of 42 clusters from the RCS- 1 over the redshift range 0. 3 < z < 1. 0 and spanning an approximate range in mass of 10 ^{ 14 - 15 } Msun, we show the number of IR-luminous galaxies in clusters above a fixed IR luminosity of 2 x 10 ^{ 11 } Msun per <b>unit</b> <b>cluster</b> mass evolves as (1 +z) ^{ 5. 1 +/- 1. 9 }. These results assume a single star forming galaxy template; the presence of AGN, and an evolution in their relative contribution to the mid-IR galaxy emission, will alter the overall number counts per cluster and their rate of evolution. We infer the total SFR per <b>unit</b> <b>cluster</b> mass and find T_SFR/M_c ~ (1 +z) ^{ 5. 4 +/- 1. 9 }. This evolution can be attributed entirely to {{the change in the}} in-falling field galaxy population. The T_SFR/M_c (binned over all redshift) decreases with increasing cluster mass with a slope (T_SFR/M_c ~ M_c^{- 1. 5 +/- 0. 4 }) consistent with the dependence of the stellar-to-total mass per <b>unit</b> <b>cluster</b> mass seen locally. The inferred star formation seen here could produce ~ 5 - 10 % of the total stellar mass in massive clusters at z = 0. Finally, we show a clear {{decrease in the number of}} IR-bright galaxies per unit optical galaxy in the cluster cores, confirming star formation continues to avoid the highest density regions of the universe at z ~ 0. 75 (the average redshift of the high-redshift clusters). While several previous studies appear to show enhanced star formation in high-redshift clusters relative to the field we note that these papers have not accounted for the overall increase in galaxy or dark matter density at the location of clusters. Once this is done, clusters at z ~ 0. 75 have the same or less star formation per unit mass or galaxy as the field. Comment: Accepted for publication in A...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{large-scale}} data centers, many servers are in-terconnected via {{a dedicated}} networking structure, {{so as to}} satisfy specific design goals, such as the low equipment cost, the high network capacity, and the incremental expansion. The topological properties of a networking structure are crit-ical factors that dominate {{the performance of the}} entire da-ta center. The existing networking structures are either fully random or completely structured. Although such networking structures exhibit advantages on given aspects, they suffer ob-vious shortcomings in other essential fields. In this paper, we aim to design a hybrid topology, called R 3, which is the com-pound graph of structured and random topology. It employs random regular graph as a <b>unit</b> <b>cluster</b> and connects many such clusters by means of a structured topology,i. e. the gen-eralized hypercube. Consequently, the hybrid topology com-bines the advantages of structured as well as random topolo-gies seamlessly. Meanwhile, a coloring-based algorithm is proposed for R 3 to enable fast and accurate routing. R 3 pos-sesses many attractive characteristics, such as the modularity and expansibility at the cost of only increasing the degree of any node by one.

40|$|Abstract — A {{fundamental}} {{challenge in}} data centers {{is how to}} design distinguished networking topology for efficiently interconnecting {{a large number of}} servers. This paper studies the design of Data Center Networking (DCN) from the aspect of the degree/diameter problem, which determines desirable DCNs that support the largest number of servers given maximum server degree and given diameter. More specifically, we propose the bidimensional compound network (BCN) to interconnect servers with dual ports and low-cost commodity switches. BCN is a level-i irregular compound graph recursively defined in the first dimension for 0 ≤i, and a level one regular compound graph in the second dimension. In each dimension, a high-level BCN employs a one low level BCN as a <b>unit</b> <b>cluster</b> and connects many such clusters by means of a complete graph. A BCN of level one in each dimension is the largest known DCN with server degree 2 and diameter 7, and is large enough for a single data center. In addition, BCN has many attractive features, such as low diameter, constant server degree, high bisection width, supporting of incremental expansion, and good fault-tolerance ability. Mathematic analysis and comprehensive simulations show that BCN possesses excellent topology properties and is a viable interconnection structure for data centers.

An algorithm creates a "cluster," which is a $d$-dimensional rectangle. The initial length of each edge of a cluster is 0. An algorithm can extend an edge until it reaches unit length independently of other dimensions. The task of an algorithm is to cover a new given point either by creating a new cluster and assigning it to the point, or by extending edges of an existing cluster created in past times. The goal is to minimize {{the total number of}} created clusters. Chan and Zarrabi-Zadeh proposed some method to obtain a competitive algorithm for the $d$-dimensional case using an algorithm for the one-dimensional case, and thus the one-dimensional case has been extensively studied including some variants of the <b>unit</b> <b>clustering</b> problem.

In this study, we reconstructed a mega-phylogeny of a cosmopolitan and hyperdiverse genus of ECM fungi, Russula, sampling from annotated collections and utilizing publically available sequences deposited in GenBank. Metadata from molecular operational taxonomic <b>unit</b> <b>cluster</b> sets were examined to infer the distribution and plant association of the genus.

We propose the generalized diversification rate' hypothesis to explain the reversed latitudinal diversity gradient pattern in Russula as we detect a higher net diversification rate in extratropical lineages.

The method was developed in the framework of the open- source Parallel Particle-Mesh library for handling the efficient data-parallelism on a CPU (Central Processing <b>Unit)</b> <b>cluster,</b> and utilized a O(N log N) -type fast multipole method for computational acceleration. Simulations with the actuator disc resulted in a wake expansion, velocity deficit profile, and induction factor that showed a close agreement with theoretical, numerical, and experimental results from literature. Also the shear layer expansion was present; the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the shear layer was triggered due to the round-off limitations of a numerical method, but this instability was delayed to beyond 1 diameter downstream due to the particle smoothing. Simulations with the 3 -bladed turbine demonstrated that a purely 3 -dimensional flow representation is challenging to model with particles. The manifestation of local complex flow structures of highly stretched vortices made the simulation unstable, but this was successfully counteracted by the {{application of}} a particle strength exchange scheme.

40|$|In chapter 1, I {{present a}} spectroscopic and {{photometric}} study of 105 Spitzer-MIPS 24 micron detected {{galaxies in the}} fields of candidate clusters from the SpARCS survey. I spectroscopically both confirm nine clusters of galaxies at 0. 07 < z < 0. 49 and investigate the nature of the cluster members and field galaxies to compare their optical and infrared star formation activities. Spectroscopic classifications reveal different populations of galaxies in clusters and in the field. Most 24 micron sources are star forming galaxies which are mostly dusty starbursts. I conclude that specific star formation rates of star forming galaxies in clusters are not dependent upon clustercentric radius, but, rather, dependent upon stellar mass. In chapter 2, I present the results of an infrared study of 250 galaxy clusters at 0. 2 < z < 1 from the SpARCS survey. My sample spans a cluster mass range 14 < log M_sun < 15 with an average about 2 x 10 ^ 14 M_sun over the redshift. Assuming a star forming galaxy template, I statistically count the number of infrared luminous galaxies in clusters above a fixed inferred infrared luminosity of 6 x 10 ^ 11 L_sun per <b>unit</b> <b>cluster</b> mass and find it increases with redshift. Fitting a simple power law, I measure an evolution of (1 + z) ^(5. 2 ± 0. 5) within R_ 200 and (1 + z) ^(9. 6 ± 1. 6) within R = 2 Mpc from the cluster center over the redshift range of this sample. By accounting for the evolution of infrared galaxies in the field, I show that this observed evolution in clusters is due to new infalling field galaxies. Also, I estimate the total star formation rate per <b>unit</b> <b>cluster</b> mass (SFR/M_cluster) and find a similar evolution of (1 +z) ^(5. 6 ± 0. 5) within R_(200) and (1 +z) ^(8. 6 ± 1. 5) within R = 2 Mpc from the cluster center. The surface density of the infrared luminous galaxies seems to decrease as the distance from cluster center increases. Finally, I show that the accretion rate of infalling infrared galaxies from the field into clusters increases at higher redshifts. In chapter 3, I investigate the position of MORPHS spectral types of galaxies at z < 0. 5 on an IRAC color-color diagram. My sample includes 57 members from a galaxy cluster (SpARCS J 104101 + 581741) at z = 0. 0726 and 26 members from three other clusters at z = 0. 288, 0. 353 and 0. 487 along with 24 galaxies in the field. I find that the IRAC color-color diagram isolates QSOs, poststarbursts, and passive galaxies very well but it is unable to distinguish between pure star forming and AGN galaxies because of the complexity of PAH emission lines in their spectra. At lower redshifts, I observe an evolutionary sequence of star forming galaxies from passive to starburst galaxies...|$|E

New cataclysmic variables (CVs) and main sequence chromospherically active binaries (ABs) have been identified, enabling a larger sample for comparison of the Lx, Fx/Fv and X-ray vs. optical color distributions. Comparison of the numbers of CBs with Lx > 10 ^ 31 erg/s in 4 core collapse vs. 12 King model clusters reveals that the specific frequency Sx (number of CBs per <b>unit</b> <b>cluster</b> mass) is enhanced in core collapse clusters, even when normalized for their stellar encounter rate. Although core collapse is halted by the dynamical heating due to stellar (and binary) interaction with CBs in the core, we conclude that production of the hardest CBs [...] especially CVs [...] is enhanced during core collapse. NGC 6397 has its most luminous CVs nearest the cluster center, with two newly discovered very low luminosity (old, quiescent) CVs far from the core.

As dispersal over unoccupied habitat {{is likely to be}} more costly than dispersal within a population, we predicted that individuals leaving the natal population have a lower body condition, being inferior to heavier territorial individuals. Fine-scale genetic structure was detected in both sexes. Female relatedness decreased continuously from R = 0. 21 at 25 m to zero at 500 m. Maximum male relatedness R = 0. 05 was constant at distances between 25 - 75 m, becoming zero at 100 m.

Assignment tests estimated significantly more migrants among males, while Bayesian clustering estimated only a single genetic <b>unit</b> <b>cluster</b> for males among the seven locations. The mean body mass of migrant males (44 g) was significantly lower than for males that remained resident and thus dispersed within their sub-population (48 g).

The proportion reporting at least one fall was 44 % in vitamin D-treated and 43 % in control residents. The differences between the vitamin D and control groups were not statistically significant. The incidence of all non-vertebral fractures in the care homes (3. 2 % per year) and of hip fractures (1. 1 % per year) was low, similar to rates in elderly people in sheltered accommodation, and the pre-treatment serum 25 -hydroxy vitamin D concentration was high [median 47 nmol/l, measured in a 1 % (n = 18) sample]. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that vitamin D prevents fractures or falls in elderly people in care home accommodatio...|$|E

A core problem in this application is {{to come up with}} effective profiles and a good measure to compare the similarity of two profiles. In this paper, we investigate an existing keyword-based user profiling scheme and identify its limitations. Then, we propose an improved version of it and demonstrate that our proposed version is more consistent than the existing approach with respect to the observed replied rates of a user to a posting based on the similarity of the profiles...|$|R
