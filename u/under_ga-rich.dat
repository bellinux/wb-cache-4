At 680 C, the Ga/N ratio is found to have a dominant impact on the zinc-blende GaMnN epilayer growth rate and the resultant composition, morphology and microstructure. A maximum growth rate and an optimised microstructure are associated with growth under slightly Ga-rich conditions. A reduced growth rate and enhanced Mn incorporation are associated with growth under slightly N-rich conditions.

Prior to QDs growth, a GaN buffer layer, ~ 100 nm thick was grown at ~ 700 ºC, <b>under</b> intermediate <b>Ga-rich</b> conditions to burry possible impurities and to provide flat surface. The targeted 20 % In content for QDs growth was calibrated by growth of thin (~ 20 nm) compact InGaN layers, varying growth temperature and Ga/N flux ratio. The In content in the compact layers was estimated by X-ray diffraction technique. The InGaN QDs were grown at 580 ºC with the nitrogen flux set to 3 nm/min (in (0001) GaN equivalent growth rate units) and the Ga flux set to 50 % of the nitrogen flux value. The In flux was varied until the effective stoichiometry (conditioned by InN decomposition and In desorption) was achieved. To provide stable In adlayer coverage (and thus avoid transient effects), two monolayers (MLs) of metallic indium were deposited prior to growth of 4 InGaN MLs. Then, the sample was left either in vacuum or under active nitrogen flux for typically 60 s before the growth temperature was sharply decreased. When 2 MLs In excess was desorbed, the Stransky-Krastanov transition occurred, as confirmed in-situ by RHEED.

Ga and Sb profiles measured with secondary ion mass spectrometry reveal that Ga diffuses faster than Sb by several orders of magnitude. This strongly suggests that the two self-atom species diffuse independently on their own sublattices. Experimental results lead us to conclude that Ga and Sb diffusion are mediated by Ga vacancies and Sb interstitials, respectively, and not by {{the formation of a}} triple defect proposed earlier by Weiler and Mehrer [Philos. Mag. A 49, 309 (1984) ]. The extremely slow diffusion of Sb up to the melting temperature of GaSb is proposed to be a consequence of amphoteric transformations between native point defects which suppress the formation of those native defects which control Sb diffusion. Preliminary experiments exploring the effect of Zn indiffusion at 550  °C on Ga and Sb diffusion reveal an enhanced intermixing of the Ga isotope layers compared to undoped GaSb.

To this end, nominally undoped GaSb/Al_xGa_ 1 _-_xSb heterostructures were subjected to thermal treatment under both Sb-rich and Ga-rich conditions in the temperature range of 600 C to 700 C. For characterisation of the heterostructures, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction were applied.

The present study shows that the mechanism of interdiffusion of the group-III atoms in the GaSb-AlSb system can be described in terms of vacancies on the group-III sublattice.

The nanorods sometimes contained extended threading defects, which were faulted dipoles lying on { 10 - 10 } planes with a displacement vector of 1 / 2 [0001], which act as sources for spiral growth. By overgrowing the nanorods <b>under</b> <b>Ga-rich</b> conditions, continuous epilayers were formed with threading defect densities down to 108 cm- 2. In a second approach, nanorods produced by etching through a self-organised layer of Ni islands were overgrown by metal-organic chemical vapour deposition, to produce overlayers with defect densities down to 5 * 107 cm- 2. In both cases, the mechanisms by which the nanorod layer reduces the threading defect density are identified...|$|E
