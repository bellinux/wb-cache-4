25|$|While {{writers and}} editors have {{generally}} ensured that events occurring in spin-offs and their parent series are usually mutually consistent with each other, so that events {{in one such}} strip do not contradict events in another, much less care – if any – is taken to ensure a <b>uniform</b> <b>continuity</b> between crossover series.

A fundamental system of entourages of this uniformity is provided by the setsThis uniform structure on M generates the usual metric space topology on M. However, different metric spaces can have the same uniform structure (trivial example is provided by a constant multiple of a metric).

40|$|The {{notion of}} uniform {{countable}} additivity or <b>uniform</b> absolute <b>continuity</b> is present implicitly in the Lebesgue Dominated Convergence Theorem and explicitly in the Vitali-Hahn-Saks and Nikodym Theorems, respectively. V. M. Dubrovsky studied {{the connection between}} uniform countable additivity and <b>uniform</b> absolute <b>continuity</b> {{in a series of}} papers, and Bartle, Dunford, and Schwartz established a close relation-ship between uniform countable additivity in ca(£) and operator theory for the clas-sical continuous function spaces C(K). Numerous authors have worked extensively on extending and generalizing the theorems of the preceding authors. Specifically, we mention Bilyeu and Lewis as well as Brooks and Drewnowski, whose efforts molded the direction and focus of this paper. This paper is a study of the techniques used by Bell, Bilyeu, and Lewis in their paper on uniform exhaustivity and Banach lattices to present a Banach lattice version of two important and powerful results in measure theory by Brooks and Drewnowski. In showing that the notions of exhaustivity and continuity take on familiar forms in certain Banach lattices of measures they show that these important measure theory results follow as corollaries of the generalized Banach lattice versions.

2500|$|Continuity {{itself is}} a local {{property}} of a function—that is, a function f is continuous, or not, at a particular point, and this can be determined by looking only at {{the values of the}} function in an (arbitrarily small) neighbourhood of that point.

[...] On the other hand, it is possible to give a definition that is local in terms of the natural extension f* (the characteristics of which at nonstandard points are determined by the global properties of f), although it is not possible to give a local definition of <b>uniform</b> <b>continuity</b> for an arbitrary hyperreal-valued function, see below.|$|E
2500|$|A {{form of the}} epsilon–delta {{definition}} of continuity was first given by Bernard Bolzano in 1817. Augustin-Louis Cauchy defined continuity of [...] as follows: an infinitely small increment [...] of the independent variable x always produces an infinitely small change [...] of the dependent variable y (see e.g., Cours d'Analyse, p.34). Cauchy defined infinitely small quantities in terms of variable quantities, and his {{definition of}} continuity closely parallels the infinitesimal definition used today (see microcontinuity). The formal definition and the distinction between pointwise continuity and <b>uniform</b> <b>continuity</b> were first given by Bolzano in the 1830s but the work wasn't published until the 1930s. Like Bolzano, Karl Weierstrass denied continuity of a function at a point c unless it was defined at and {{on both sides of}} c, but Édouard Goursat allowed the function to be defined only at and on one side of c, and Camille Jordan allowed it even if the function was defined only at c. All three of those nonequivalent definitions of pointwise continuity are still in use. Eduard Heine provided the first published definition of <b>uniform</b> <b>continuity</b> in 1872, but based these ideas on lectures given by Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet in 1854.|$|E
