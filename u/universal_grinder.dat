5000|$|The {{idea of the}} [...] "universal grinder" [...] is {{that while}} count nouns usually denote whole, {{distinct}} objects (such as a steak, two steaks), the equivalent mass noun connotes a non-distinct quantity of whatever constitutes these objects (some steak). The <b>universal</b> <b>grinder</b> suggests that most count nouns {{can be used as}} mass nouns, and the distinct thing named by the noun will {{be thought of as a}} general quantity.|$|E
50|$|TIC {{specializes in}} five types of {{grinding}} machines; <b>universal</b> cylindrical <b>grinders,</b> CNC cylindrical, angular grinders, 5 axis CNC tool grinders and special purpose grinding machines. The TIC brand is particularly {{known for its}} manual & NC O.D. cylindrical grinders in the South Korean market with 60% in domestic market share. With the aid of in-process gauging systems from Marposs, it is specified that the cylindrical grinders can achieve an accuracy of 1 micron. It is broadly understood that the mechanism of the hydrodynamic spindle bearings, hydrostatic guideways in the X-axis and hand scraped guideways are the main attributes in accuracy of the cylindrical grinders. The company has recently made their debut of its manual & CNC cylindrical grinder under the brand name “TONGIL” during the EMO 2011 shows. It made its first presence in the European market in partnership with a German distributorship, Saeilo Germany.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- An {{attempt is}} made to solve {{problems}} in the process flow in an alternator production plant. The plant had to outsource their partially machined shaft for tapper grinding for a certain rating of alternator. A small study was conducted for identifying is there any opportunity to do the operation within the plant. Next approach was {{to solve the problem}} with in the plant's available resource, with high quality and law cost. Machining time and labour cost was calculated. Finally the profit of the company for {{a certain period of time}} is calculated within the available data's. This attempt helped us to know about the production process of different rated alternators, working of different departments in the firm, problems faced by a company. This machine is used to produce external cylindrical surface. The surfaces may be straight, tapered, steps or profiled. Broadly there are three different types of cylindrical grinding machine as follows: 1. Plain centre type cylindrical <b>grinder</b> 2. <b>Universal</b> cylindrical surface <b>grinder</b> 3. Centre less cylindrical surface grinder Plain centre type cylindrical grinder Index Terms- labour cost, machining time, plunge grinding, taper grinding, A I...|$|R
