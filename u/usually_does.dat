5|$|Hypertension (HTN or HT), {{also known}} as high blood {{pressure}} (HBP), is a long-term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. High blood pressure <b>usually</b> <b>does</b> not cause symptoms. Long-term high blood pressure, however, is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, vision loss, and chronic kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|In {{secondary}} adrenal insufficiency, a dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis {{leads to}} decreased {{stimulation of the}} adrenal cortex. Apart from suppression of the axis by glucocorticoid therapy, {{the most common cause}} of secondary adrenal insufficiency are tumors that affect the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary gland. This type of adrenal insufficiency <b>usually</b> <b>does</b> not affect the production of mineralocorticoids, which are under regulation of the renin-angiotensin system instead.|$|E
5|$|The average modern horse on good hay or pasture {{with light}} work <b>usually</b> <b>does</b> not need supplements; however, horses {{subjected}} to stress due to age, intensive athletic work, or reproduction may need additional nutrition. Extra fat and protein are sometimes {{added to the}} horse's diet, along with vitamin and mineral supplements. There are hundreds, if not thousands of commercially prepared vitamin and mineral supplements on the market, many tailored to horses with specialized needs.|$|E

However, since they also wanted to maintain a direct level of control over the development and operation of the title rather than outsourcing it like Square Enix <b>usually</b> <b>does,</b> the global version was delayed by a year. Direct operation allows them to ensure quality and directly take player feedback and reflect it into the service.|$|E
5|$|Agaricus bitorquis, also edible, has {{a similar}} appearance, but can be {{distinguished}} by its double ring, {{and the lack of}} a fishy or briny odor. Additionally, A.bitorquis does not stain reddish when cut, and <b>usually</b> <b>does</b> not have a scaly or warty cap. The Hungarian species A.bernardiiformis, named for its similarity to A.bernardii, is distinguished from the latter by its smaller spores (6.2–8.2 by 5.4–6.2μm) and its club-shaped cheilocystidia that measure 17–35 by 7–9.5μm. MycoBank, however, considers the two species to be conspecific.|$|E
5|$|If a large insect is {{struggling}} in a web, Portia <b>usually</b> <b>does</b> not usually take the insect, but waits {{for up to}} a day until the insect stops struggling, even if the prey is thoroughly stuck. When an insect stuck in a web owned by P. schultzi, P. labiata or any regional variant of P. fimbriata, and next to a web spider's web, the web spider sometimes enters the Portia′s web, and the Portia pursues and catches the web spider.|$|E

5|$|In a medium, light <b>usually</b> <b>does</b> not {{propagate}} {{at a speed}} {{equal to}} c; further, different types of light wave will travel at different speeds. The speed at which the individual crests and troughs of a plane wave (a wave filling the whole space, with only one frequency) propagate is called the phase velocityvp. An actual physical signal with a finite extent (a pulse of light) travels at a different speed. The largest part of the pulse travels at the group velocityvg, and its earliest part travels at the front velocityvf.|$|E
5|$|The {{ordering}} of liquid crystalline phases is extensive on the molecular scale. This order extends {{up to the}} entire domain size, which {{may be on the}} order of micrometers, but <b>usually</b> <b>does</b> not extend to the macroscopic scale as often occurs in classical crystalline solids. However some techniques, {{such as the use of}} boundaries or an applied electric field, can be used to enforce a single ordered domain in a macroscopic liquid crystal sample. The ordering in a liquid crystal might extend along only one dimension, with the material being essentially disordered in the other two directions.|$|E
5|$|When {{disturbed}} while incubating, {{this bird}} usually (just under 50% of the time) partly covers its eggs with nest material when the disruption is not sudden, but a bird with an incomplete clutch <b>usually</b> <b>does</b> {{not attempt to}} cover the eggs. When the disruption is sudden, on the other hand, the black-necked grebe usually (just under 50% of the time) does not cover its eggs. In comparison, other species of grebes cover up their eggs when leaving the nest. Predation is usually not {{the primary cause of}} egg loss, with most nesting failures occurring after the chicks have hatched. A major cause of this is the chilling of the young.|$|E

5|$|With NHL players {{participating}} in the tournament, IIHF officials began to fear that true amateurs and young players were losing their places. As a result, full world championship status {{was given to the}} IIHF World Under-20 Championship, which had been held annually since 1974 as an unofficial invitational tournament. Colloquially known as the World Junior Hockey Championship, the event was structured after the World Championships, but limited to players under the age of 20. The World Under-18 Championship was established in 1999 and typically held in April. It <b>usually</b> <b>does</b> not involve some of the top North American-based players because they are involved in junior league playoffs at the time.|$|E
5|$|Roughly speaking, Mongolian {{has eight}} cases: {{nominative}} (unmarked), genitive, dative, accusative, ablative, instrumental, comitative and directional. If a direct object is definite, it {{must take the}} accusative, while it must take the nominative if it is unspecific. In addition to case, a number of postpositions exist that usually govern genitive, ablative, or comitative case or a form of the nominative that has sometimes -Vn either for lexical historical reasons or analogy (thus maybe becoming an attributive case suffix). Nouns can take reflexive-possessive clitics indicating that the marked noun is possessed by {{the subject of the}} sentence: bi najz(-)aa avarsan I friend- save- 'I saved my friend'. However, there are also somewhat noun-like adjectives to which case suffixes seemingly cannot be attached directly unless there is ellipsis. Plurality may be left unmarked, but there are overt plurality markers, some of which are restricted to humans. A noun that is modified by a numeral <b>usually</b> <b>does</b> not take any plural affix.|$|E
5|$|The {{chloride}} anion is {{an essential}} nutrient for metabolism. Chlorine is needed {{for the production of}} hydrochloric acid in the stomach and in cellular pump functions. The main dietary source is table salt, or sodium chloride. Overly low or high concentrations of chloride in the blood are examples of electrolyte disturbances. Hypochloremia (having too little chloride) rarely occurs in the absence of other abnormalities. Its sometimes associated with hypoventilation. It can be associated with chronic respiratory acidosis. Hyperchloremia (having too much chloride) <b>usually</b> <b>does</b> not produce symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they tend to resemble those of hypernatremia (having too much sodium). Reduction in blood chloride leads to cerebral dehydration; symptoms are most often caused by rapid rehydration which results in cerebral edema. Hyperchloremia can affect oxygen transport.|$|E

5|$|The first egg {{is often}} laid when the nest {{is little more}} than a pad of grass, and a further egg is laid on each {{subsequent}} day. Both sexes incubate the eggs, which start hatching after about 14days; all hatch with 48hours despite the extended laying period. The black, downy precocial chicks soon leave the nest but are fed and protected by the parents. Fledging occurs after four to six weeks, and the young can fly before they are fully grown. It is not known whether the African crake has a second brood, but the corn crake <b>usually</b> <b>does.</b> Where grass is not tall enough at the start of the season, the first nest may be constructed in herby or marsh vegetation, with the second brood in hay. The second nest may also be at a higher altitude that the first, to take advantage of the later-developing grasses further up a hill.|$|E
5|$|The least weasel feeds {{predominantly}} on mouse-like rodents, including mice, hamsters, gerbils and others. It <b>usually</b> <b>does</b> {{not attack}} adult hamsters and rats. Frogs, fish, small birds and bird eggs are rarely eaten. It {{can deal with}} adult pikas and gerbils, but usually cannot overcome brown rats and sousliks. Exceptional cases are known of least weasels killing prey far larger than themselves, such as capercaillie, hazel hen and hares. In England, a favoured prey item is the field vole (Microtus agrestis). These have fluctuations in population size, and in years of abundance may form up to 54% of the weasel's diet. In years of scarcity, birds form {{a greater proportion of}} the diet and female least weasels may fail to breed.|$|E
5|$|According to Jains, the {{consequences}} of karma are inevitable. The consequences may {{take some time to}} take effect but the karma is never fruitless. The latent karma becomes active and bears fruit when the supportive conditions arise. A great part of attracted karma bears its consequences with minor fleeting effects, as generally most of our activities are influenced by mild negative emotions. However, those actions that are influenced by intense negative emotions cause an equally strong karmic attachment which <b>usually</b> <b>does</b> not bear fruit immediately. It takes on an inactive state and waits for the supportive conditions—like proper time, place, and environment—to arise for it to manifest and produce effects. If the supportive conditions do not arise, the respective karmas will manifest at the end of maximum period for which it can remain bound to the soul. These supportive conditions for activation of latent karmas are determined by the nature of karmas, intensity of emotional engagement at the time of binding karmas and our actual relation to time, place, surroundings. There are certain laws of precedence among the karmas, according to which the fruition of some of the karmas may be deferred but not absolutely barred.|$|E

5|$|Banksia prionotes × hookeriana {{has also}} been {{verified}} as occurring in the wild, but only in disturbed locations. The two parent species have overlapping ranges and are pollinated by the same honeyeater species; and though preferring different soils, they often occur near enough {{to each other for}} pollinators to move between them. It therefore appears that the only barrier to hybridisation in undisturbed areas is the different flowering seasons: B.prionotes has usually finished flowering by the end of May, whereas flowering of B.hookeriana <b>usually</b> <b>does</b> not begin until June. In disturbed areas, however, the increased runoff and reduced competition mean extra nutrients are available, and this results in larger plants with more flowers and a longer flowering season. Thus the flowering seasons overlap, and the sole barrier to interbreeding is removed. The resultant F1 hybrids are fully fertile, with seed production rates {{similar to that of the}} parent species. There is no barrier to backcrossing of hybrids with parent species, and in some populations this has resulted in hybrid swarms. This raises the possibility of the parent species gradually losing their genetic integrity, especially if the intermediate characteristics of the hybrid offer it a competitive advantage over the parent species, such as a wider habitat tolerance. Moreover, speciation might occur if the hybrid's intermediate characteristics allow it to occupy a habitat unsuited to both parents, such as an intermediate soil type.|$|E
5|$|Males take up nesting sites {{before the}} {{breeding}} season, by frequently calling beside them. Unmated males start nest construction and call particularly frequently to attract females. When a female approaches a male during this period, the male displays by {{moving up and}} down while drooping and shivering his wings, pushing up his head, raising and spreading his tail, and showing his bib. Males may try to mate with females while calling or displaying. In response, a female will adopt a threatening posture and attack a male before flying away, pursued by the male. The male displays in front of her, attracting other males, which also pursue and display to the female. This group display <b>usually</b> <b>does</b> not immediately result in copulations. Other males usually do not copulate with the female. Copulation is typically initiated by the female giving a soft dee-dee-dee call to the male. Birds of a pair copulate frequently until the female is laying eggs, and the male mounts the female repeatedly each time a pair mates.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{supported}} the idea, believing {{it the best}} solution to an intractable problem. The bill passed, providing for a commission of five representatives, five senators, and five Supreme Court justices. To ensure partisan balance, there would be seven Democrats and seven Republicans; the fifteenth member {{was to be a}} Supreme Court justice chosen by the other four on the commission (themselves two Republicans and two Democrats). Justice David Davis, an independent respected by both parties, was expected to be their choice, but he upset the careful planning by accepting election to the Senate by the state of Illinois and refusing to serve on the commission. The remaining Supreme Court justices were all Republicans and, with the addition of Justice Joseph P. Bradley to the place intended for Davis, the commission had an 8–7 Republican majority. Randall nevertheless favored the compromise, even voting in favor of it in the roll call vote (the Speaker <b>usually</b> <b>does</b> not vote). The commission met and awarded all of the disputed ballots to Hayes by an 8–7 party-line vote.|$|E
