50|$|The pass grades for BGCSE are, from highest to lowest, A*, A, B, C, D, E, F, G and U. The {{process to}} decide these grades {{involves}} the uniform mark scheme (UMS).

50|$|The former {{decision}} is original classification. A {{great majority of}} classified documents are created by derivative classification. For example, if one piece of information, taken from a secret document, is put into a document along with 100 pages of unclassified information, the document, as a whole, will be secret. Proper rules stipulate that every paragraph will bear a classification marking of (<b>U)</b> for <b>Unclassified,</b> (C) for Confidential, (S) for Secret, and (TS) for Top Secret. Therefore, in this example, only one paragraph will have the (S) marking. If the page containing that paragraph is double-sided, the page should be marked SECRET on {{top and bottom of}} both sides.|$|R

Some pupils may decide to take one or more GCSEs before or after they sit the others, and people may apply to take GCSEs at any point either internally through an institution or externally. A level 1 GCSE covers grades C to G or 1 to 5 (commonly {{referred to as the}} foundation tier) whereas a level 2 GCSE covers grades A* to C or 4 to 9 (commonly referred to as the higher tier). Five level 2 GCSEs, including English and Maths, are generally required (as well as an A or B in the specific subject) to continue to the level 3 Advanced GCE level (A-Level) or equivalent level 3 qualifications. From September 2017, grades will be awarded from 9 to 1; a grade 9 being equivalent to an upper A* and a grade 1 being marginally better than a <b>U</b> (<b>unclassified</b> in the former system). Some schools start GCSEs in year 9. It is also the equivalent to Junior Certifcate examinations in the Republic of Ireland.|$|E
40|$|The Fisheries Handbook {{provides}} information {{on the design of}} fish passage facilities and their operation. Key elements include biological requirements of fish, biological design criteria, and the design of passage facilities. The bio-logical requirements of fish include discussions of water quality, reactions to toxicants and pollutants, spawning needs, and the effects of fishing pressure. These biological requirements are then used to define biological criteria such as the swimming speeds of juvenile and adult life stages. The biological criteria can then be used by engineers and biologists to design fish passage and mitigation facilities. Passage through turbines, spillways, and conduits are discussed, along with locks, transportation, and mechanical handling. Hatcheries, rearing ponds, diseases, fish pumps, and the use of anesthetics are discussed. Examples of adult fishways and locks are presented. The thirty-five subject areas covered by the handbook include sections on issues and concepts, pertinent tables and graphs of relationships and data, and references.

40|$|To study {{recombination}} and {{the natural}} polymorphism in pol of HIV- 1 strains in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) we sequenced the protease and RT genes for 70 HIV- 1 strains previously characterized in the env V 3 -V 5 region from a sentinel surveillance study in 2002. For 41 of the 70 (58. 6 %) strains, the same subtype/CRF designations were observed in pol and env. Twenty-three (32. 9 %) of 70 pol sequences were complex recombinants involving two to five subtypes as well as fragments {{that could not be}} classified into any of the known subtypes. All subtypes were involved in recombination events. <b>Unclassified</b> (<b>U)</b> and env subtype H strains were very likely to be recombinant strains. Overall, many minor mutations were identified in the protease sequences. Although at the time of our study ARV use was not yet widespread in DRC, three strains were identified with one major mutation associated with drug resistance: L 90 M and M 46 L in protease and K 103 N in RT...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{characterized}} four HIV- 1 strains from Cameroon, Gabon, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), {{collected during}} independent serosurveys, and previously found to cluster in the pol gene with HIV- 1 MAL and HIV- 1 NOGIL 3, two complex recombinant viruses {{reported in the}} early HIV epidemic, and with the recombinant strain 04 FR.

Some of the unclassified fragments were related to unclassified regions described in either CRF 04 or CRF 09 strains. Careful reanalysis of HIV- 1 MAL and HIV- 1 NOGIL 3 demonstrated that these strains were related exclusively to CRF 45 _AKU and either two subtype D fragments for HIV- 1 MAL or one subtype H segment for HIV- 1 NOGIL 3.

50|$|The pass grades for A Levels are, from highest to lowest, A*, A, B, C, D and E. The {{process to}} decide these grades {{involves}} the uniform mark scheme (UMS). Under this scheme, four-module A levels have a maximum mark of 400 UMS (or 200 UMS each for AS and A2), and six-module A levels have a maximum mark of 600 (or 300 UMS each for AS and A2). The maximum UMS within AS and A2 may be split unequally between each modules. For example, a Physics AS may have two exam modules worth 90 UMS and 150 UMS, and a coursework module worth 60 UMS. The 'raw marks' i.e. actual score received {{on a test}} may differ from UMS awarded. On each assignment, the correspondence of raw marks to UMS is decided by setting grade boundaries, a process which involves consultation by subject experts and consideration of statistics, aiming to keep standards for each grade the same year on year. Achieving less than 40% results in a <b>U</b> (<b>unclassified).</b> For passing grades, 40% corresponds to an E grade, 50% a D, 60% a C, 70% a B, and 80% an A. The A* grade was introduced in 2010 and is awarded to candidates who average 80% UMS across all modules, with a score over 90% UMS in all A2 modules. In Mathematics, which comprises six 100 UMS modules, only the C3 and C4 modules count towards this requirement. In Further Mathematics and Additional Further Mathematics, where more than three A2 modules can be taken, the three best-scoring A2 modules count. There is no A* grade at AS level.|$|E
50|$|Initially {{candidates}} were only awarded a {{pass or fail}} classification, though the independent exam boards soon offered competing numeric and alphabetic classifications, for example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 would be a pass, while grades 7, 8 and 9 were fails from the JMB. From 1975 standardized alphabetic grades where introduced with grades A, B, C, D, and E were passes, and f and <b>U</b> (<b>Unclassified)</b> were fails. Between 1965 and 1985 grades were allocated primarily on a norm-referenced basis, assigning a fixed proportion of each cohort to each grade (A 10%, B 15%, C 25-30%, D 5-10%, E 5-10%, U 15-20%). Though some exceptions existed, both at the subject and Exam Board level, with Latin and Greek pass rates being consistently higher than other subjects, with 75.4% passing in 1976, in contrast to an average 59% pass rate across all subjects e.g. Biology 56.4%, History 57%. The pass rate and top awards by the Oxford & Cambridge board were also consistently higher than the other boards e.g. In 1976, 27% of Latin entrants gained an A, and ~17% of French, German and Music candidates, this was attributed to the O&C board being primarily used by the Independent schools. The proportion obtaining a pass, A-D, or equivalent was initially fixed at 57% - 58%, and remained under 60% through the 1970s, though there was regional variation with Northern Ireland awarding consistently more pass grades than Wales e.g. In 1982, the pass rates were: Northern Ireland 62%, England 58% Wales 53%. In 1984 a decision was taken, by the Secondary Examinations Council, to replace the norm referencing with criteria referencing, where 16+ and 18+ grades would in future be awarded on Examiner Judgement, this change was implemented, at O-Level, in June 1986. In the final year DES statistics were available 6.8% achieved an A, and 39.8% an A-C grade.|$|E
40|$|Background: Angola {{presents}} {{a very complex}} HIV- 1 epidemic characterized by the co-circulation of several HIV- 1 group M subtypes, intersubtype recombinants and <b>unclassified</b> (<b>U)</b> variants. The viral diversity outside the major metropolitan regions (Luanda and Cabinda) and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (DRM) since the introduction of HAART in 2004, however, has been barely studied. Methods: One hundred and one individuals from the Central (n = 44), North (n = 35), and South (n = 22) regions of Angola were diagnosed as HIV- 1 positive and had their blood collected between 2008 and 2010, {{at one of the}} National Referral Centers for HIV diagnosis, the Kifangondo Medical Center, located in the border between the Luanda and Bengo provinces. Angolan samples were genotyped based on phylogenetic and bootscanning analyses of the pol (PR/RT) gene and their drug resistance profile was analyzed. Results: Among the 101 samples analyzed, 51 % clustered within a pure group M subtype, 42 % were classified as intersubtype recombinants, and 7 % were denoted as U. We observed an important variation in the prevalence of different HIV- 1 genetic variants among country regions, with high frequency of subtype F 1 in the North (20 %), intersubtype recombinants in the Central (42 %), and subtype C in the South (45 %). Statistically significant difference in HIV- 1 clade distribution was only observed in subtype C prevalence between North vs South (p = 0. 0005) and Central vs Sout...|$|R

The purpose of CSF is to reimburse coalition countries for logistical and military support provided to United States military operations in the global war on terror. In Pakistan, reimbursements through CSF are intended to enable the government of Pakistan to attack terrorist networks in the FATA and stabilize the border areas. It is structured as a reimbursement mechanism in which the U. S. Department of Defense (Defense) policy is to validate that support was provided, costs were incurred, and these costs were incremental to normal Pakistani military operations. We were asked to assess how CSF reimbursements have been used to meet U. S. goals in Pakistan, and what controls exist to ensure that reimbursements are for legitimate claims. ...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. This thesis makes three contributions to the methodology of multi-area reliability calculations. It examines the Simultaneous Decomposition-Simulation approach, and presents a technique to bound the approximation introduced by the simulation phase. The new approach keeps track of the probability of the unclassified states to keep the error under a specified fraction of the loss of load probability. There are two methods to select a sample state from a set, uniform sampling and proportional sampling. This study replaces uniform sampling with proportional sampling, so as to introduce a suitable convergence criterion. New algorithms are developed to use proportional sampling in the Simultaneous-Decomposition Simulation. A variance reduction technique is also introduced to make the sampling more efficient. The accuracy and efficiency of the improved Simultaneous Decomposition Simulation approach is demonstrated on the three area and ten area systems, where each area consists of an IEEE-RTS generation system. There is about 10 to 20 times reduction in the sample size for L and W sets. It is observed that with error bounding in the decomposition phase, simulation contribution from <b>unclassified</b> <b>U</b> sets can be negligible, resulting in considerable savings in the simulation CPU time. Finally, this thesis presents a comparison of two commonly used models in MonteCarlo simulation, random sampling and sequential sampling. They are both widely used in the industry. The mathematical analysis and system studies indicate that sequential sampling converges much slower than random sampling. However sequential sampling yields the index of frequency directly, and random sampling can only give index of frequency under the assumption of coherence...|$|R

(cont.) The winners of these competitions are not to new entrants into the satellite business, but rather they are other established aerospace companies - suggesting that it is more than "organizational newness" that leads to success and more than age that leads to obsolescence. Anecdotal drivers of this trend abound, however, there is no systematic examination of the satellite industry and few settings in which the loss of incumbents to other large and established firms have been extensively analyzed. This thesis is an attempt to unravel the puzzling and repeated loss of incumbents to organizations that are in many ways very similar in terms of size, bureaucracy, technology etc. and yet which {{seem to be able to}} out-compete the winners of prior competitions over 90 % of the time. This thesis argues that three factors drive this trend: 1. Non-incumbents leverage new architecture innovations to provide superior performance 2. Non-incumbent management encourages pursuit of architectural innovation 3. Non-incumbent optimistic bias enables aggressive bidding to win. by Paul Scearce. Thesis (S. M. M. O. T.)
