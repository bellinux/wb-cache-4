The harbour patrol craft Appletree was sunk in a collision with an RAF pinnace east of the Lismore light in October 1940 with, according to one report, the loss of two lives.

In a {{separate}} move, the paratroop battalion, 101 Bataillon de Parachutistes (101st Parachute Battalion), was helicoptered to Ban Na, southeast of the objective, to begin their approach march. In a third part of the operation, the Hmong Bataillon Guerrier 201 (Warrior Battalion 201) paired with the Neutralist Bataillon d'Infanterie 15 (Battalion of Infantry 15); they were helicoptered to Phou So to walk south to Muang Soui.|$|E

2500|$|Executives of Warner Bros. Records (Reprise Records's parent company) told Harris {{they would}} agree to record her if she would [...] "get a hot band".

Burton was a renowned guitarist, {{starting}} in Ricky Nelson's band in the 1950s, and Hardin {{had been a member}} of the Crickets. Other Hot Band members were drummer John Ware, pedal steel guitarist Hank DeVito, and bassist Emory Gordy, Jr., with whom Harris had worked while performing with Parsons.

The result of his sabbatical is his aptly titled Transition LP, but does it live <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> promising <b>name?</b> Transition is an impressive effort that focuses as much on the lyrics as it does production - both of which are slick, on point and considered throughout. The album suffers from being two tracks too long, particularly as there is little deviance in subject matter, but it's nonetheless a significant step up from his debut that ultimately leaves us excited for his next metamorphosis.
