BrabantStad is the fastest growing economic region in the Netherlands, with the Brabantse Stedenrij (polycentric city region) {{as one of the}} national top regions, behind the Randstad megalopolis (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht). The partnership in North Brabant aims to form an <b>urban</b> <b>network</b> and to make the province explicitly known as a leading knowledge region within Europe. With a total of 1.5million people and 20% of the industrial production in the Netherlands is BrabantStad one of the major economical important, metropolitan regions of the Netherlands. Of all the money that goes to research and development in the Netherlands, one third is spent in Eindhoven. A quarter of the jobs in the region are in technology and ICT.|$|E
40|$|The recent {{technological}} developments in communication networks have results into {{a broad range}} of networks, e. g.,Wi-Fi, Mobile ad-hoc networks(MANET), 3 G and other cellular networks, wireless sensor networks, etc. It is envisioned that such diverse networks must cooperate with each other to form cooperative <b>urban</b> <b>networks,</b> for the sake of making use of all the services and resources. Such integration poses great challenges for service discovery, for example, interoperability, robustness, scalability and context-awareness. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical architecture to meet the requirements of service discovery in cooperative <b>urban</b> <b>networks,</b> in which we assume various <b>urban</b> <b>networks</b> are connected to overlay infrastructure through cooperative gateway to form cooperative <b>urban</b> <b>networks.</b> We apply hierarchical architecture to <b>urban</b> <b>networks</b> and overlay infrastructure network in order to discover services using optimal service selection algorithm to take into account context-awareness issue.

40|$|In many {{planning}} documents (e. g. ESDP), {{there has}} been an explicit objective to create a more balanced and polycentric system of cities and a new urban-rural relationship. However, it seems that {{it is very difficult to}} implement these general level ideas in practice and quite often deliberately planned <b>urban</b> <b>networks</b> and spatial network-based structures remain more or less hollow. This paper is based on tentative conclusion that in order to create real <b>urban</b> <b>networks</b> the objectives and strategies of various organisations should be better taken into account; issue-based actor oriented networks is the basis for <b>urban</b> <b>networks.</b> Therefore in addition to the access also the competencies, awareness and motivation of various actors should be focused more in creation of <b>urban</b> <b>networks.</b> This paper focuses on the relationship between spatial and issue-based networks...|$|R

25|$|The {{industrial}} revolution changed a mainly rural society into an urban one, {{but with a}} strong contrast between northern and southern Belgium. During the Middle Ages and the Early Modern Period, Flanders was characterised {{by the presence of}} large urban centres (...) {{at the beginning of the}} nineteenth century this region (Flanders), with an urbanisation degree of more than 30 per cent, remained one of the most urbanised in the world. By comparison, this proportion reached only 17 per cent in Wallonia, barely 10 per cent in most West European countries, 16 per cent in France and 25 per cent in Britain. Nineteenth century industrialisation did not affect the traditional urban infrastructure, except in Ghent (...) Also, in Wallonia the traditional <b>urban</b> <b>network</b> was largely unaffected by the industrialisation process, even though the proportion of city-dwellers rose from 17 to 45 per cent between 1831 and 1910. Especially in the Haine, Sambre and Meuse valleys, between the Borinage and Liège, where there was a huge industrial development based on coal-mining and iron-making, urbanisation was fast. During these eighty years the number of municipalities with more than 5,000 inhabitants increased from only 21 to more than one hundred, concentrating nearly half of the Walloon population in this region. Nevertheless, industrialisation remained quite traditional in the sense that it did not lead to the growth of modern and large urban centres, but to a conurbation of industrial villages and towns developed around a coal-mine or a factory. Communication routes between these small centres only became populated later and created a much less dense urban morphology than, for instance, the area around Liège where the old town was there to direct migratory flows.|$|E

The fragility of the Amazonian <b>urban</b> <b>networks</b> is related to the creation of barriers for the flows of people, goods and services, like: a) the great distances that separate the capital cities from the other towns and hamlets; b) the lack of transport and communication infrastructure in large areas of the Amazon territory; c) the large proportion of the population without material and educational resources needed for them to actively participate in the various kinds of flows. <b>urban</b> <b>networks,</b> Amazon, imbalances...|$|R

After losing the northern portion of their region to the marauding Fulanis, many Oyo indigenes retreated deeper into the Ibadan environs.

Its central location and accessibility from the capital city of Lagos were major considerations in the choice of Ibadan as the headquarters of the Western Provinces (1939) which ranged from the northernmost areas of Oyo State to Ekeremor, Bomadi and Patani, which were regions transferred from the old Delta province in the Old Western region and later Mid-west to the old Rivers state and later Bayelsa, in the redistricting of Nigeria carried out by the Yakubu Gowon administration shortly before the Nigerian civil war ...|$|E
