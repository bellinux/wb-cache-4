After Hurricane Katrina hit several U.S. states in 2005, Grand Forks adopted the city of Biloxi, Mississippi. Current Grand Forks mayor Michael Brown stated that it was important [...] "to utilize the experience from those people who went through those disasters, like our fire chief, police chief and public works directors. So we went to Biloxi and said, 'This is what we have learned.'" [...] Grand Forks leaders met with Biloxi city officials, and sent a list of contacts and a 24-page booklet that detailed how to coordinate volunteer agencies and how to interact with FEMA. One Biloxi city official stated that Grand Forks had [...] "just helped us to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> were looking at, and gave us some direction to go in, which was really needed, with the rebuilding and the recovering." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 13, 2006, Hayes {{announced}} that he was quitting the show because of the series' treatment of religion, saying, [...] "There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins. Religious beliefs are sacred to people, and at all times should be respected and honored. As a civil rights activist of the past 40 years, I cannot support a show that disrespects those beliefs and practices." [...] The Guardian observed that Hayes did not specifically mention Scientology in his statement. Later in an interview on CNN's Showbiz Tonight, Hayes added he did not see the episode itself, but was told about it. In a separate interview, he reportedly said regarding Parker and Stone, [...] "Guys, you have it all wrong. We're not like that. I know that's your thing, but get your information correct, because somebody might believe that shit, you know? But I understand what they're doing.

500|$|Because of RCA's {{leniency}} in the end, the band's departure was peaceful despite complications, {{and they}} still hold respect for RCA for what the label allowed them to do. Heppner credits the label for allowing the record that RCA funded to go to some other company who would want it instead, while Watchorn acknowledges that recent economic troubles would have mandated that record labels only keep [...] "the {{things that are going}} to sell" [...] on their rosters. Heppner noted that labels usually shelve albums permanently if they are deemed unfit for commercial sale rather than give them to the artists who recorded them, and that the band were [...] "really, really lucky" [...] in comparison. Priestess found and signed with New York City independent record label Tee Pee Records to replace RCA in late 2009; Tee Pee Records had offered to sign the group years earlier, but the band chose RCA over Tee Pee. They enjoy being signed to Tee Pee Records rather than RCA, where they feel more [...] "at home". The band have stated that they feel less pressure to succeed on Tee Pee Records, and they do not feel any less important to the label compared to its higher-profile artists, such as American Idol contestants. [...] "Tee Pee is the perfect label for us right now, because they totally <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> want to do," [...] Heppner stated. [...] "I am alas [...] stoked to be labelmates with so many wicked bands." [...] He additionally noted that the only advantage the band had when signed to RCA was more money, and that having a different kind of music meant that Priestess were not as lucrative as a band such as the Foo Fighters, who were more heavily promoted.|$|E

Disillusioned with Jozef Pilsudski's policies, the Merezhkovskys and Zlobin left for France on 20 October without Filosofov, who chose {{to stay in the}} city with Boris Savinkov. In Paris Gippius concentrated on making appointments, sorting out mail, negotiating contracts and receiving guests. The Merezhkovsky's talks, as Nina Berberova remembered, always revolved around two major themes: Russia and freedom. Backing Merezhkovsky in his anti-Bolshevik crusade, she was deeply pessimistic as regards what her husband referred to as his 'mission'.

Hilary Goldstein of IGN also praised these factors, and praised Champion Mode for carrying the emotional weight of the game, stating that it gave the game [...] "more sense of emotion out of what is usually a soulless experience".|$|R

2500|$|In {{summarizing}} the biographical works on Gandhi, Blema S. Steinberg concluded she was decidedly non-ideological. Only 7.4% (24) {{of the total}} 330 biographical extractions posit ideology {{as a reason for}} her policy choices. Steinberg noted Gandhi's association with socialism was superficial; only having a general and traditional commitment to the ideology, by way of her political and family ties. Gandhi personally had a fuzzy concept of socialism. In one of the early interviews she had given as Prime Minister, Gandhi had ruminated: [...] "I suppose you could call me a socialist, but you have <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> mean by that term...we used the word [...] because it came closest to {{what we wanted to do}} here – which is to eradicate poverty. You can call it socialism; but if by using that word we arouse controversy, I don't see why we should use it. I don't believe in words at all." [...] Regardless of the debate over her ideology or lack of thereof, Gandhi remains a left-wing icon. She has been described by Hindustan Times columnist, Pankaj Vohra as [...] "arguably the greatest mass leader of the last century." [...] Her campaign slogan, Garibi Hatao (Eng: Remove Poverty), has become the iconic motto of the Indian National Congress. To the rural and urban poor, untouchables, minorities and women in India, Gandhi was [...] "Indira Amma or Mother Indira." ...|$|E

[...] But this is not true. [...] It {{is very difficult to}} find in the land [...] cultivated fields that are not used for planting. [...] Only those sand fields or stone mountains that would require the investment of hard labour and great expense to make them good for planting remain uncultivated and that's because the Arabs do not like working too much in the present for a distant future. Therefore, {{it is very difficult to}} find good land for cattle. [...] And not only peasants, but also rich landowners, are not selling good land so easily...We who live abroad {{are accustomed to}} believing that the Arabs are all wild desert people who, like donkeys, neither see nor understand what is happening around them. [...] But this is a grave mistake. [...] The Arab, like all the Semites, is sharp minded and shrewd.

While he recovered, Taggart's friend Matt Cameron, former drummer for Soundgarden and current drummer for Pearl Jam, filled in for Taggart on the tracks [...] "Right Behind You (Mafia)" [...] and [...] "Are You Sad?", which Taggart had already written the drum parts for.
