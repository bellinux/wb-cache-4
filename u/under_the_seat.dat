5|$|Emeco founder Wilton C. Dinges {{developed}} the Emeco 1006 chair in 1944 {{in collaboration with}} the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA). It was originally designed for the US Navy, which needed a chair for the deck of battleships that could survive sea air and a torpedo blast {{to the side of the}} ship. The chairs had eye bolts <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat,</b> so they could be attached to a ship-deck using cables.|$|E
5|$|Before take-off, D'Mario placed three cloth-covered foam {{cushions}} {{on top of}} {{a heating}} vent under the instructor navigator's seat in the aft section of the lower deck. Shortly after take-off, another cushion was placed <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat.</b> The flight was uneventful until the scheduled mid-air refueling from a KC-135 Stratotanker, which had to be conducted manually because of an error with the B-52G's autopilot. About one hour after refueling, while the aircraft was circling above its designated area, Captain Haug directed co-pilot Svitenko to take his rest period. His seat was taken by the spare pilot, D'Mario. The crew was uncomfortable because of the cold, although the heater's rheostat was turned up, so D'Mario opened an engine bleed valve to draw additional hot air into the heater from the engine manifold. Because of a heater malfunction, the air barely cooled as it traveled from the engine manifold to the cabin's heating ducts. During the next half-hour, the cabin's temperature became uncomfortably hot, and the stowed cushions ignited. After one crew member reported smelling burning rubber, they looked for a fire. The navigator searched the lower compartment twice before discovering the fire behind a metal box. He attempted to fight it with two fire extinguishers, but could not put it out.|$|E
500|$|With one of {{the prime}} {{suspects}} cleared, the police, aided by Lisa, eliminate other suspects, including Puente (whose revenge took the form of a [...] "slanderous mambo"), Principal Skinner (who was found by Chalmers to be applying what he thought was camouflage make-up {{at the time of the}} shooting), Willie (who cannot fire a gun due to arthritis in his index fingers), and Moe (who is cleared via polygraph test). After a surreal dream about Lisa, Chief Wiggum finds an eyelash on Mr. Burns' suit which matches Simpson DNA. At the same time, Mr. Burns wakes up from his coma, exclaiming [...] "Homer Simpson!" [...] The police raid the Simpson home and find a gun <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> of their car, covered with Homer's fingerprints and loaded with bullets that match the one fired into Mr. Burns. Homer is arrested for attempted murder, but escapes from the paddywagon when it overturns.|$|E

500|$|Mr. Burns reveals, {{after leaving}} the town meeting, he came across Maggie eating a {{lollipop}} in the Simpsons' car. Mr. Burns decided to try , but Maggie would not {{let go of the}} lollipop, resulting in a struggle. As he finally yanked it away, his gun slipped from its holster into Maggie's hands and fired at Mr. Burns. The gun and lollipop both fell beneath the car seat; Homer would later unknowingly leave fingerprints on the gun while feeling around <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> for an ice cream cone he accidentally dropped. Lisa guesses with his last strength, Mr. Burns pointed to the [...] "S" [...] and [...] "W" [...] on the sundial (with the [...] "W" [...] appearing as an [...] "M" [...] from his perspective) to identify his assailant. Mr. Burns corrects her, saying he fell across the sundial in order to swallow his gold fillings to prevent them from being pilfered by paramedics; the positions of his arms was purely coincidental.|$|E
500|$|As {{a member}} of the Nazi Party and the Abwehr {{intelligence}} service, Schindler was in danger of being arrested as a war criminal. Bankier, Stern, and several others prepared a statement he could present to the Americans attesting to his role in saving Jewish lives. He was also given a ring, made using gold from dental work taken out of the mouth of Schindlerjude Simon Jeret. The ring was inscribed [...] "Whoever saves one life saves the world entire." [...] To escape being captured by the Russians, Schindler and his wife departed westward in their vehicle, a two-seater Horch, initially with several fleeing German soldiers riding on the running boards. A truck containing Schindler's mistress Marta, several Jewish workers, and a load of black market trade goods followed behind. The Horch was confiscated by Russian troops at the town of Budweis, which had already been captured by Russian troops. The Schindlers were unable to recover a diamond that Oskar had hidden <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat.</b> They continued by train and on foot until they reached the American lines at the town of Lenora, and then travelled to Passau, where an American Jewish officer arranged for them to travel to Switzerland by train. They moved to Bavaria in Germany in the fall of 1945.|$|E
500|$|McVeigh {{then added}} a dual-fuse {{ignition}} system accessible from the truck's front cab. He drilled twoholes {{in the cab}} of the truck <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat,</b> while twoholes were also drilled {{in the body of}} the truck. Onegreen cannon fuse was run through each hole into the cab. These time-delayed fuses led from the cab through plastic fish-tank tubing conduit to two sets of non-electric blasting caps which would ignite around [...] of high-grade explosives that McVeigh stole from a rock quarry. The tubing was painted yellow to blend in with the truck's livery, and duct-taped in place to the wall to make it harder to disable by yanking from the outside. The fuses were set up to initiate, through shock tubes, the [...] of Tovex Blastrite Gel [...] "sausages", which would in turn set off the configuration of barrels. Of the 13filled barrels, nine contained ammonium nitrate and nitromethane, and four contained a mixture of the fertilizer and about [...] of diesel fuel. Additional materials and tools used for manufacturing the bomb were left in the truck to be destroyed in the blast. After finishing the truck bomb, the twomen separated; Nichols returned home to Herington and McVeigh with the truck to Junction City.|$|E

2500|$|In his account, a Mr Baker deceived police {{by driving}} his trap {{across the bridge}} at 7:30 PM, {{indicating}} that he would shortly be returning, then picked up Donovan, who hid <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat.</b> He then returned, was not stopped, and Donovan was able to quietly slip {{over the side of}} the bridge at about 8:10 or 8:20 PM, exactly at high tide. He hung on to the bottom of the rails then dropped. Baker then went down to collect him, but Donovan had swum to the opposite shore, where he was seen by another witness, identified only as [...] "a young man who was with Mr Baker". A planned rescue boat was for some reason absent, but he was helped by another boat.|$|E
2500|$|As well {{as being}} {{painstakingly}} restored by enthusiasts to accurate wartime specification, the M20 has also been developed by specialists for speed trials. A 1938 BSA M20 ridden by Bill Jenkins from Dallas achieved {{a top speed of}} 108mph at Bonneville Salt Flats making it the fastest M20 for this venue in the world. The original side-valve engine was extensively modified and fuelled with nitrous oxide. [...] The intake port fed by the carburetor, originally horizontal, was re-drilled at a steep angle into the cylinder casting so it pointed up at the underside of the intake valve. The motorcycle did however retain the long BSA prop stand that hinged <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> and clipped to the rear mudguard when not in use [...] so it looked like a stock M20. [...] In October 1995 an M20 fitted with a BSA Gold Star [...] crankshaft sprocket and running on a 95% methanol / 5% acetone mix ridden by Pat Jeal achieved a terminal speed of 112mph at the disused airfield of RAF Elvington, Yorkshire.|$|E
2500|$|Internally {{the rotor}} is cooled and {{lubricated}} by engine sump {{oil and the}} aforementioned trochoid pump. Engine oil is filtered by an easily accessible car-type oil filter on the lower {{right side of the}} cases. The filter includes an internal bypass valve in case of blockage. Further lubrication specifically for the tip, corner and side seals is provided by oil from a tank located <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat.</b> An engine-driven metering pump sends oil from this external tank into the carburetor at a ratio of around 100:1. Metering of the oil quantity is mechanically controlled by cables from the throttle grip. The metering pump also provided lubrication for the final drive chain. A second line is routed from the metering pump and around the bike, ending just above the drive chain behind the sprocket cover. This feature was also disconnected on the [...] "A" [...] models by a simple blanking plug at the metering pump. The gearbox is separated from the engine sump and has its own oil supply. Suzuki marketed its own brand of rotary oil but also approved at least two other oils for use in its rotary engine. Shell Super 10-20-50 and Castrol GTX were both endorsed lubricants.|$|E

2500|$|Reunited {{with his}} Knights, Arthur meets Tim the Enchanter who warns {{them of the}} danger of a killer rabbit. When the rabbit bites a knight's head off, Arthur uses the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch against it, {{knocking}} down a nearby hill and revealing that the [...] "evil rabbit" [...] was actually a puppet controlled by a surprised puppeteer. A large stone block showing a combination of letters and numbers is also revealed. (The letters are based on the seat numbering system used by each theatre. [...] They are changed from performance to performance to discourage audience members from intentionally booking any of the possible seats. [...] The seat is typically on the aisle in one of the first few rows nearest the orchestra. In the Broadway production and on the tour it is either A101, B101, C101 or D101; i.e., Seat 101 – which is house right of the center aisle – of Rows A, B, C, or D. [...] In the West End Production a word is revealed – DONE, CONE or BONE, referring to D1, C1 and B1 respectively.) After pondering the final clue, Arthur admits that they're [...] "a bit stumped with the clue thing" [...] and asks God to [...] "give them a hand". A large hand points to the audience and Arthur realises that the letters and numbers refer to a seat number in the audience. The grail is [...] "found" [...] (with some sleight of hand) <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> and the person sitting in the seat is rewarded with a small trophy and a polaroid photo. ("The Holy Grail"). Arthur marries the Lady of the Lake, who reveals that her name is Guinevere; Lancelot marries Herbert (who finally has a chance to sing); and Sir Robin decides to pursue a career in musical theatre. Herbert's father attempts to interrupt the finale and stop all of the [...] "bloody singing", but is hit over the head with a shovel by Lancelot, a nod to [...] "He is Not Yet Dead". [...] ("Act 2 Finale/Always Look on the Bright Side of Life (Company Bow)").|$|E
