It can also be observed that only a maximum of three hops is possible to achieve energy gains. More than three hops in this <b>use</b> <b>case</b> result in consuming more energy than the direct LR link. The reason is again the lower ratio of possible data rates on the IEEE 802.11 g and on the WiMAX compared to the ratio in the first <b>use</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> WiMedia and IEEE 802.11 g.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In recent years, {{models are}} {{increasingly}} {{used throughout the}} entire lifecycle in software engineering projects. In effect, the need for managing these models in terms of change tracking and versioning emerged. However, many publications recognized that existing approaches for Version Control (VC) do not work well on graph-like models, and therefore proposed alternative techniques and methods. They can be categorized into two different classes: state-based and operation-based approaches. There are publications that show advantages of operationbased over state-based approaches in selected <b>use</b> <b>cases.</b> However, there are no results available on the advantages of operation-based approaches in the most common <b>use</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> a VC system: review and understand change. In this paper, we present and discuss both approaches and their <b>use</b> <b>cases.</b> Moreover, we present a design of an empirical study to compare a state-based with an operation-based approach in the <b>use</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> reviewing and understanding change. ...|$|R
