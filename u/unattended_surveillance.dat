40|$|Abstract â€” Today {{surveillance}} {{systems are}} every-where. Human observers watching live videos of specific areas are not efficient {{due to the}} likely loss of attention. On the other side, <b>unattended</b> <b>surveillance</b> systems re-quire that people analyze hours of recordings {{when they have to}} search for some specific events, e. g. identify peo-ple responsible of violence, theft or other offences. In many cases a specific search in the video has to be ac-complished in the shortest amount of time. This paper presents MotionFinder, a tool that performs video anal-ysis by computing an interactive summarization of the movements in a scene. Once the summarization process is complete, the tool responds in real time to inquires. For example, human investigators may search for spe-cific areas in the video that show high levels of activity or where they know that something occurred (e. g. : prop-erty damaged or stolen). The tool responds by showing only the scenes in which some activity occurred for that specific area of the video.

Various verification schemes have been tried on analog video signals ever since the mid- 1970 `s. These schemes have provided a measure of protection but have never been widely adopted. The development of reasonably priced complex video processing integrated circuits makes it possible to digitize a video image and then compress the resulting digital file into a smaller file without noticeable loss of resolution. Authentication and/or encryption algorithms can be more easily applied to digital video files that have been compressed. The compressed video files require less time for algorithm processing and image transmission. An important safeguards application for authenticated, compressed, digital video images is in <b>unattended</b> video <b>surveillance</b> systems and remote monitoring systems. The use of digital images in the surveillance system makes it possible to develop remote monitoring systems that send images over narrow bandwidth channels such as the common telephone line. This paper discusses the video compression process, authentication algorithm, and data format selected to transmit and store the authenticated images...|$|R
40|$|The {{capture and}} storage of video images have been major {{engineering}} challenges for safeguard and security applications since {{the video camera}} provided a method to observe remote operations. The problems of designing reliable video cameras were solved in the early 1980 `s {{with the introduction of}} the CCD (charged couple device) camera. The first CCD cameras cost in the thousands of dollars but have now been replaced by cameras costing in the hundreds. The remaining problem of storing and viewing video images in both attended and <b>unattended</b> video <b>surveillance</b> systems and remote monitoring systems is being solved by sophisticated digital compression systems. One such system is the PC- 104 three card set which is literally a ``video engine`` that can provide power for video storage systems. The use of digital images in surveillance systems makes it possible to develop remote monitoring systems, portable video surveillance units, image review stations, and authenticated camera modules. This paper discusses the video card set and how it can be used in many applications...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a novel approach}} for detecting <b>unattended</b> packages in <b>surveillance</b> video. Unlike the traditional approach to just detecting stationary objects in monitored scenes, our approach detects unattended packages based on accumulated knowledge about human and non-human objects from continuous object tracking and classification. We design different reasoning rules for detecting different scenarios of the unattended package events. In the case where a package is left unattended by a single person explicitly, a rule using human activity recognition is introduced to decide the package ownership. In the case where a suspicious package is dropped down {{by a group of}} humans or under heavy occlusions, a rule based on historic tracking and classification information is proposed. Furthermore, an additional rule is given to reduce false alarms that may happen with traditional stationary object detection methods.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{request for}} safety, security and environment protection at {{local and national}} level reveal the deficiency of the traditional surveillance and control centers to satisfy the needs and requirements of modern border control systems for homeland protection where land border {{is expected to be}} monitored as well as the maritime one. This is, for instance, the case of any land border affected by hidden immigration and/or illegal traffics as well as any small areas such as critical infrastructures or military/ civilian posts in forest or jungle environment characterized by vegetation. In such challenging environment, logistics constraints strongly recommend to have very low power devices able to operate months or years without maintenance. A such scenario should be the perfect place for implementing an Unattended Ground Sensors (UGS) network making use FOliage PENetration (FOPEN) radar for border control.

40|$|Introduction: Ambient {{intelligence}} {{technologies are}} {{a means to}} support ageing-in-place by monitoring clients in the home. In this study, monitoring is applied {{for the purpose of}} raising an alarm in an emergency situation, and thereby, providing an increased sense of safety and security. Apart from these technological solutions, there are numerous environmental interventions in the home environment that can support people to age-in-place. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the needs and motives, related to ageing-in-place, of the respondents receiving ambient intelligence technologies, and to investigate whether, and how, these technologies contributed to aspects of ageing-in-place. Methodology: This paper presents the results of a qualitative study comprised of interviews and observations of technology and environmental interventions in the home environment among 18 community-dwelling older adults with a complex demand for care. These respondents had a prototype of the <b>Unattended</b> Autonomous <b>Surveillance</b> system, an example of ambient intelligence technology, installed in their homes as a means to age-in-place. The UAS-system offers a large range of functionalities, including mobility monitoring, voice response, fire detection, as well as wandering detection and prevention, which can be installed in different configurations. Results: The respondents had various motives to use ambient intelligence technologies to support ageing-in-place. The most prominent reason was to improve the sense of safety and security, in particular, in case of fall incidents, when people were afraid not to be able to use their existing emergency response systems. The ambient intelligence technologies were initially seen as a welcome addition to strategies already adopted by the respondents, including a variety of home modifications and assistive devices. The systems tested increased the sense of safety and security and helped to postpone institutionalisation. Respondents came up with a set of specifications in terms of the operation and the design of the technology. False alarms were also regarded as a sign that the ambient intelligence technology is functioning. Moreover, a good integration of the new technologies in the provision of health care is indispensable, and installation should be done in an acceptable and unobtrusive manner. Ambient intelligence technologies can contribute to an increased safety and security at home. The technologies alone offer no all encompassing solution as home care and additional environmental interventions are still needed to support ageing-in-place. Results of the study are used to further improve the ambient intelligence technologies and their implementation...|$|R
40|$|Home {{automation}} {{that allows}} for telecare services is increasingly becoming a tool to help older adults live independently and to improve perceived safety and security. The number of older adults receiving professional care, in relation to housing, {{on a daily basis}} is not very large. Only 15 % receives home care, 5 % lives in a care home, and about 2. 5 % resides in a nursing home. The majority of older adults live in the community. The <b>Unattended</b> Autonomous <b>Surveillance</b> system by TNO Defense is an integrated system that combines many functionalities for community-dwelling (older) adults, who are entitled to receiving nursing home care based on official assessments. The technology is implemented among people in the towns of Baarn and Soest in the centre of the Netherlands. The UAS system aims to support Ageing-in-Place and delaying the demand for expensive institutional care. Besides the benefits for the care recipient, informal or family carers are supported in care through the technology installed as well. Professional carers, for instance, home care, can benefit from the increased self care capabilities of the care recipient. In cases of emergency, i. e., when alarms are activated, people in the care centre can access the home via a camera. The aim is to study the perceptions of independent living, the role and quality of care received, and how people think technology can support them in their daily lives. This is the first round of interviewing on a total of three rounds. Methods In order to investigate the needs of the users, phenomenological qualitative research is carried out among a group of 30 independently living older adults (some with mild psychogeriatric health problems) and their (family) carers, using semi-structured questionnaires on home care received, demand for care, use and need of assistive technologies and perceived safety and security. The questionnaires were based on earlier work by Bijsterveld 1 and Demeris et al. 2. The first part of the study, performed between May and September 2007, included 14 subjects. The transcripts were analysed using the MAXQDA program. First, each transcript was read in its entirety. Then, they were read a second time to develop codes that were grouped into themes consistent with the interviews, which emerged from the narratives and the interview guides. To be considered a major theme, the code had to have appeared in more than 25 % of the narratives and more than once in each of the narratives. Third, quotes that summarised the essence of each personâ€™s subjective experience were recorded. Finally, a master list of themes from each interview was developed to allow for easy cross-interview examination. Results and discussion Preliminary results showed a positive attitude of older adults towards the system as a means to provide additional telecare and to increase perceived security in their surroundings. The fact that professional carers are immediately available after an emergency call, for instance via video communication, eases their feelings of insecurity. Family carers were more enthusiast about the system than many older adults, because the UAS system that is always present and vigilant takes away a part of the care burden. The over-time contribution of the UAS system to independence is to be studied...|$|R
