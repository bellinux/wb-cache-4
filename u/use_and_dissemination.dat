40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{proposes a}} visualization system that supports clinical knowledge evolution procedure−development, <b>use,</b> evaluation, <b>and</b> <b>dissemination.</b> The visualization encodes essential patient care steps into visuals and also seamlessly incorporates patient records, clinical documentation, imaging archives, and decision-making aids into the visuals. The system addresses current problems of inconsistent clinical interpretation among medical practitioners <b>and</b> inconsistent <b>use</b> of evidence-based medical practice because the verbal description is inherently limited in illustrating procedures and associated decision logics. The visualization enables clinicians to recognize past history {{of patient care}} process, practice clinical knowledge, and envision the prospective care process more efficiently. The research work in this paper modeled the knowledge evolution cycle using clinical guidelines (CPG) in a format of medical logic module (MLM). The tree structure of clinical decision logics, based in MLM, is visualized in a hyperbolic geometry to best meet the criteria while making the visual representation more useful {{in the context of}} clinical use. The interaction in the visualization is designed to support development, <b>use,</b> evaluation, <b>and</b> <b>dissemination</b> of CPGs. Considering the visualization as a clinical decision aid evaluating patient care options, the design visually encodes quantitative or qualitative information in concert with the tree visualization. In conclusion, the proposed visualization enables medical practitioners to visually understand clinical knowledge, organize patient care process, and evaluate the process in a unified abstract representation...|$|R
