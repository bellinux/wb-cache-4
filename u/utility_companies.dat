5|$|There are {{a variety}} of end uses to weather forecasts. Weather {{warnings}} are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property. Forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture, and therefore to traders within commodity markets. Temperature forecasts are used by <b>utility</b> <b>companies</b> to estimate demand over coming days. On an everyday basis, people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day. Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and wind chill, forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead and survive them. In 2014, the US spent $5.1 billion on weather forecasting.|$|E
5|$|In 1890 Lilly {{and other}} civic leaders founded the Commercial Club; Lilly was elected {{as its first}} president. The club, renamed the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce in 1912, was the primary vehicle for Lilly's city {{development}} goals. It was instrumental in making numerous advances for the city, including citywide paved streets, elevated railways to allow vehicles and people to pass beneath them, and a city sewage system. The companies that provided these services were created through private and public investments and operated at low-cost; in practice they belonged to the companies' customers, who slowly bought each company back from its initial investors. The model was later followed other regions of Indiana to establish water and electric <b>utility</b> <b>companies.</b> The Commercial Club members also helped fund the creation of parks, monuments, and memorials, as well as successfully attracted investment from other businessmen and organizations to expand Indianapolis's growing industries.|$|E

5|$|On September 15, an {{existing}} tropical storm watch was extended northward to the Merrimack River in Massachusetts. The next day, {{a tropical storm}} warning was extended northward to Plymouth, Massachusetts, but was soon replaced by a hurricane warning. The watch stretching to the Merrimack River was then replaced by a warning. By 0900 UTC on September 17, all tropical cyclone advisories were lifted. In Connecticut, <b>utility</b> <b>companies</b> readied supplies and emergency crews {{in advance of the}} hurricane. In Massachusetts and Rhode Island, with the anticipation of heavy rains, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) prepared to send eight teams into the field to take measurements along 30 rivers. Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Almond advised residents to prepare for the storm's onslaught. The storm disrupted many residents' travel plans in the state, while people evacuated from certain coastal communities. The threat of Hurricane Floyd forced schools, malls, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst to close.|$|E

5|$|On termination, the Menominee, {{which was}} one of the wealthiest tribes prior to termination, became one of the poorest. In 1954, the tribe's timber {{operations}} allowed it to be self-sufficient. The tribe, which owned <b>utility</b> <b>companies,</b> paid for a hospital, BIA salaries, local schools, and a stipend to tribal members. The tribe was forced to use its reserve funds to develop a termination plan that they did not want and instead of having a reserve, they entered into termination with a $300,000 deficit. Menominee County was created out of the old reservation boundaries and the tribe immediately had to finance its own police and fire protection. Without federal support and with no tax base, the situation became dire. The tribe closed the hospital, sold its utility company, and contracted those services to neighboring counties. The Menominee Enterprises, Inc., formed to care for the tribe's needs after termination, was unable to pay property taxes and began to consider selling off tribal property. Many Menominee tribal members believed that the sponsor of the termination bill, Senator Arthur Wilkins of Utah, intended to force the loss of rich tribal lands to non-Indians. In 1962, the state of Wisconsin took the position that the hunting and fishing rights were abrogated by the termination act and that the tribal members were subject to state hunting and fishing regulations. With the poverty in the former reservation, the loss of hunting rights meant the loss of one of their last remaining means of survival.|$|E

30|$|We {{consider}} a smart grid system with multiple consumers and one energy producer, e.g., a <b>utility</b> <b>company.</b> These consumers receive electricity {{from the same}} aggregator which distributes electricity to the consumers. Each consumer is equipped with an energy consumption scheduler (ECS) for scheduling the household energy consumption. A smart meter {{is connected to the}} set of consumers from which it collects and analyzes the energy consumption. This smart meter gathers (almost) accurate readings automatically, at requested time intervals, and relays them to the <b>utility</b> <b>company.</b> Using this information, the aggregator (<b>utility</b> <b>company)</b> can adjust its energy generation, purchase, and transmission accordingly. The communication between the <b>utility</b> <b>company</b> and the consumers’ smart meters is done through the local area network (LAN) by using appropriate communication protocols. Let N denote the set of consumers that share the same aggregator, where the number of consumers is N. Figure 1 illustrates the system model.|$|R
40|$|This study {{proposes a}} new model of demand {{response}} management for a future smart grid that consists of smart microgrids. The microgrids have energy storage units, responsive loads, controllable distributed generation units, and renewable energy resources. They can buy energy from the <b>utility</b> <b>company</b> when the power generation in themselves cannot satisfy the load demand, and sell extra power generation to the <b>utility</b> <b>company.</b> The goal is to optimize the operation schedule of microgrids to minimize the microgrids’ payments and the <b>utility</b> <b>company’s</b> operation cost. A parallel distributed optimization algorithm based on games theory is developed to solve the optimization problem, in which microgrids only need to send their aggregated purchasing/selling energy to the <b>utility</b> <b>company,</b> thus avoid infringing its privacy. Microgrids can update their operation schedule simultaneously. A case study is implemented, and the simulation results show that the proposed method is effective and efficient...|$|R
