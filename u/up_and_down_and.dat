5|$|Fork-marked lemurs are {{sensitive}} to light intensity, and emerge at twilight, calling numerous times and answering their neighbors' calls before going off to forage. Just before dawn, they also communicate again {{on their way to}} their sleep site. Cold temperatures can also cause individuals to retire to their sleeping site as early as two hours before dawn. Their eye shine creates a unique pattern among lemurs because they tend to bob their heads <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> from side to side.|$|E
5|$|Ultima Underworlds game {{engine was}} written by a small team. Chris Green {{provided}} the game's texture mapping algorithm, which was applied to walls, floors and ceilings. The engine allowed for transparencies, walls at 45 degree angles, multiple tile heights and inclined surfaces, and other aspects. Ultima Underworld was the first video game to implement many of these effects. The game {{was also the first}} indoor, real-time, 3D first-person game to allow the player to look <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> to jump.|$|E

5|$|Both sexes reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{one year of}} age. The male mates with the female by swimming close to her with his head lowered and tail raised, continually whistling. If there {{is a group of}} males, they will chase the female in flight until only one drake is left. The female prepares for copulation, which takes place in the water, by lowering her body; the male then bobs his head <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> mounts the female, taking the feathers {{on the back of her}} head in his mouth. After mating, he raises his head and back and whistles.|$|E
5|$|The next {{successful}} ascent {{was made}} on January 29, 1834, 40years later, by the Scottish botanist David Douglas, who also reached the summit caldera using the ʻAinapō Trail. By the time Douglas reached the summit the environment had put him under extreme duress, but he nonetheless stayed overnight to make measurements of the summit caldera's proportions and record barometric data on its height, both now known to be widely inaccurate. Douglas collected biological samples on the way both <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> after a difficult and distressing descent began collating his samples; he planned to return to England, but instead several months later his body was mysteriously discovered crushed in a pit besides a dead wild boar.|$|E
5|$|George Malcolm Stratton (September 26, 1865– October 8, 1957) was a {{psychologist}} who pioneered the study of perception in vision by wearing special glasses which inverted images <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> left and right. He studied {{under one of the}} founders of modern psychology, Wilhelm Wundt, and started one of the first experimental psychology labs in America, at the University of California, Berkeley. Stratton's studies on binocular vision inspired many later studies on the subject. He was one of the initial members of the philosophy department at Berkeley, and the first chair of its psychology department. He also worked on sociology, focusing on international relations and peace. Stratton presided over the American Psychological Association in 1908, and was a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He wrote a book on experimental psychology and its methods and scope; published articles on the studies at his labs on perception, and on reviews of studies in the field; served on several psychological committees during and after World War I; and served as advisor to doctoral students who would go on to head psychology departments.|$|E

5|$|The {{sea otter}} propels itself {{underwater}} {{by moving the}} rear end of its body, including its tail and hind feet, <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> is capable of speeds of up to 9km/h (5.6mph). When underwater, its body is long and streamlined, with the short forelimbs pressed closely against the chest. When at the surface, it usually floats on its back and moves by sculling its feet and tail from side to side. At rest, all four limbs can be folded onto the torso to conserve heat, whereas on particularly hot days, the hind feet may be held underwater for cooling. The sea otter's body is highly buoyant because of its large lung capacity – about 2.5 times {{greater than that of}} similar-sized land mammals – and the air trapped in its fur. The sea otter walks with a clumsy, rolling gait on land, and can run in a bounding motion.|$|E
25|$|S {{waves and}} later {{arriving}} surface waves do main damage compared to P waves. P wave squeezes and expands {{material in the}} same direction it is traveling. S wave shakes the ground <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> back and forth.|$|E

500|$|St Paul's {{became the}} place to go to hear the latest news of current affairs, war, religion, {{parliament}} and the court.

500|$|Courtney {{primarily}} plays as a {{right back}} and is a versatile player, also being able to play at left back and centre back. He is an attacking player and has pace and athleticism.

500|$|Thus did three-axis control evolve: wing-warping for roll (lateral motion), forward {{elevator}} for pitch (<b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down)</b> <b>and</b> rear rudder for yaw (side to side). On March 23, 1903, the Wrights {{applied for}} their famous patent for a [...] "Flying Machine", {{based on their}} successful 1902 glider. Some aviation historians believe that applying the system of three-axis flight control on the 1902 glider was equal to, or even more significant, than the addition of power to the 1903 Flyer. Peter Jakab of the Smithsonian asserts that perfection of the 1902 glider essentially represents invention of the airplane.|$|E

500|$|After {{sighting}} a female, the tufted morph pushes {{himself as}} high as possible with the last three pair of legs, and claps with the foremost pair, {{while at the same}} time waving the palps <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> swinging the abdomen from side to side, usually about [...] from the female. In contrast, the gray morph crouches down and points the foremost two pairs of legs directly forward, crosses the tips of the legs creating a triangle-like configuration, holds his orange-colored palps beneath his forward eyes, and glides back and forth in stationary or receding semi-circles in front of the female, [...] at [...] away. The movements of the two morphs are identical later in the sequence.|$|E
500|$|Originally, the reticle {{could only}} move <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> lateral {{movement}} {{was done by}} moving the player side-to-side; this, however, proved to be cumbersome and was changed. The [...] "Look Out!" [...] text bubble was added because of difficulty judging bullet distances due to the screen's artificial 3D depth. Clint and Annie were designed in clothing that was emblematic of the time period, and Annie's dress was chosen instead of jeans to avoid overlapping with Clint's design and to enable easier animation. The characters' names were suggested by the American Natsume offices. Due to the game's low budget, voice actors were not used; instead, Taniguchi's voice was recorded in the office bathroom for Clint.|$|E
500|$|After {{rallying}} {{his troops}} near Schwennenbach – well beyond their starting point – Eugene prepared {{to launch a}} second attack, led by the second-line squadrons under the Duke of Württemberg-Teck. Yet again they {{were caught in the}} murderous cross-fire from the artillery in Lutzingen and Oberglauheim, and were once again thrown back in disarray. The French and Bavarians, however, were almost as disordered as their opponents, and they too were in need of inspiration from their commander, the Elector, who was seen – [...] " ... riding <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> inspiring his men with fresh courage." [...] Anhalt-Dessau's Danish and Prussian infantry attacked a second time but could not sustain the advance without proper support. Once again they fell back across the stream.|$|E

500|$|Results May Vary was {{released}} on September 23, 2003, and received largely unfavorable reviews. Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine panned the album, writing, [...] "the music has no melody, hooks, or energy, [...] all {{attention is focused on}} the clown jumping <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> screaming in front, and long before the record is over, you're left wondering, how the hell did he ever get to put this mess out?" [...] The Guardian reviewer Caroline Sullivan wrote, [...] "At least Limp Bizkit can't be accused of festering in the rap-rock ghetto [...] But Durst's problems are ever-present – and does anybody still care?" [...] Despite criticisms of the album, it was a commercial success, peaking at No.3 on the Billboard 200.|$|E
500|$|Depending on {{how fast}} the winds from a {{waterspout}} are whipping, anything that is within about one yard of {{the surface of the}} water, including fish of different sizes, frogs, and even turtles, can be lifted into the air. A waterspout can sometimes suck small animals such as fish {{out of the water and}} all the way up into the cloud. Even if the waterspout stops spinning, the fish in the cloud can be carried over land, buffeted <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> around with the cloud’s winds until its currents no longer keep the flying fish in the atmosphere. Depending on how far they travel and how high they are taken into the atmosphere, the fish are sometimes dead by the time they rain down. People as far as [...] inland have experienced raining fish. Fish can also be sucked up from rivers, but raining fish is not a common weather phenomenon.|$|E
500|$|The {{interior}} {{also contained}} a pegboard chess board {{connected to a}} pantograph-style series of levers that controlled the model's left arm. The metal pointer on the pantograph moved over the interior chessboard, and would simultaneously move {{the arm of the}} Turk over the chessboard on the cabinet. The range of motion allowed the director to move the Turk's arm <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> turning the lever would open and close the Turk's hand, allowing it to grasp the pieces on the board. All of this was made visible to the director by using a simple candle, which had a ventilation system through the model. Other parts of the machinery allowed for a clockwork-type sound to be played when the Turk made a move, further adding to the machinery illusion, and for the Turk to make various facial expressions. A voice box was added following the Turk's acquisition by Mälzel, allowing the machine to say [...] "Échec!" [...] (French for [...] "check") during matches.|$|E
