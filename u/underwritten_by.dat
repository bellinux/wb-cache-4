5|$|Around 1997, {{a number}} of Rare {{employees}} left to establish separate companies. The first was Eighth Wonder, <b>underwritten</b> <b>by</b> Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, which did not produce any games before it closed. After Martin Hollis left Rare, he joined Nintendo before founding his own company Zoonami, releasing Zendoku, Go! Puzzle and Bonsai Barber. Other Perfect Dark team members, including David Doak and Steve Ellis, founded Free Radical Design and created the TimeSplitters series. It was acquired by Crytek and renamed Crytek UK before its 2014 closure, with most of its staff moving to Deep Silver Dambuster Studios.|$|E
5|$|While Gore {{has criticized}} Bush for his Katrina response, {{he has not}} spoken {{publicly}} about his part in the evacuation of 270 patients on September 3 & 4, 2005, from Charity Hospital in New Orleans to Tennessee. On September 1, Gore was contacted by Charity Hospital's Neurosurgeon Dr. David Kline, who had operated on his son Albert, through Greg Simon of FasterCures. Kline informed Gore and Simon of the desperate conditions {{at the hospital and}} asked Gore and Simon to arrange relief. On Gore's personal financial commitment, two airlines each provided a plane with one flight latter <b>underwritten</b> <b>by</b> Larry Flax. The flights were flown by volunteer airline crews and medically staffed by Gore's cousin, retired Col. Dar LaFon, and family physician Dr. Anderson Spickard and were accompanied by Gore and Albert III. Gore used his political influence to expedite landing rights in New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|Local {{historian}} Yves le Maner {{was charged}} {{with the task of}} developing the project while a feasibility study was conducted into the possibility of completing some of the original excavation work to make the site safe for public access. The plans were approved in 1993 and the site was purchased by the Commune de Helfaut. The following year, the Conseil Général du Pas-de-Calais acquired the site. The 69-million-franc project (£7.5 million at 1997 prices) was largely <b>underwritten</b> <b>by</b> the Conseil Général, which provided 35 million francs, with another 17 million coming from the regional council. The European Union provided a further 12 million, the French State provided 3 million and the Saint-Omer municipal administration funded the remaining 1 million francs; a number of private shareholders were also involved. The Societé d'Equipement du Pas-de-Calais was contracted to carry out the development work, which involved excavating a further two metres (six feet) beneath the dome, clearing out and completing the unfinished concreting of some of the tunnels, building an exhibition centre and car park in the quarry floor and installing a lift to carry visitors up from the octagon to the dome.|$|E
50|$|WDEQ {{remains a}} {{non-commercial}} and educational radio station, so no commercial announcements are aired.

50|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that the GSEs—due to their large size and market power—were far more effective at policing <b>underwriting</b> <b>by</b> originators and forcing underwriters to repurchase defective loans. By contrast, private securitizers have been far less aggressive and less effective in recovering losses from originators on behalf of investors.|$|R
50|$|WFHB {{has a small}} paid {{staff and}} over 200 volunteers, who perform a range of duties, from office {{administration}} to music and news programming.

50|$|WRPO-LP now airs an oldies format after a {{previous}} one-year {{run as a}} smooth jazz station. The switch to oldies, coupled with more professional on-air production values and audio imaging (possibly inspired by kindred spirit WSWO-LP) has produced a much more positive feedback from local listeners compared to its previous jazz format and has resulted in increased support by listener contributions and <b>underwriting</b> <b>by</b> local businesses.|$|R

50|$|Public {{broadcasting}} includes radio, {{television and}} other electronic media outlets whose primary mission is public service. In {{much of the}} world, funding comes from the government, especially via annual fees charged on receivers. In the United States, public broadcasters may receive some funding from both federal and state sources, but generally most financial support comes from <b>underwriting</b> <b>by</b> foundations and businesses ranging from small shops to corporations, along with audience contributions via pledge drives. The great majority are operated as private not-for-profit corporations.|$|R
25|$|If the MBS was not <b>underwritten</b> <b>by</b> the {{original}} {{real estate and}} the issuer's guarantee, the rating of the bonds would be much lower.

25|$|Meanwhile, the St Paul's, Regina was {{designated}} the pro-cathedral in 1944. By 1973 {{it was clear}} that the diocese would never be self-supporting — it had been a mission field of the English diocese of Lichfield but this had long since become unrealistic — other than by alienating its only substantial real estate, whose acquisition had been substantially <b>underwritten</b> <b>by</b> the original missioning diocese.|$|E

As Loebner described it, one reason the competition was created is to advance the state of AI research, at least in part, because no one had taken steps to implement the Turing Test despite 40 years of discussing it.|$|E
50|$|Donald M.

More generally, researchers attacked the idea that “integrated financial services firms” had {{played a role in}} creating the Great Depression or the collapse of the US banking system in the 1930s. If it was “debatable” whether Glass-Steagall was justified in the 1930s, it was easier to argue that Glass-Steagall served no legitimate purpose when the distinction between commercial and investment banking activities had been blurred by “market developments” since the 1960s.|$|R

That study disputed Glass-Steagall critics who suggested securities markets had been harmed by prohibiting commercial bank involvement.
