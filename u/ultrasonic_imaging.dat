40|$|Ultrasound imaging {{has long}} {{demonstrated}} utility {{in the study}} and measurement of anatomic features and noninvasive observation of blood flow. Within the last decade, advances in molecular biology and contrast agents have allowed researchers to use ultrasound to detect changes in the expression of molecular markers on the vascular endothelium and other intravascular targets. This new technology, referred to as <b>ultrasonic</b> molecular <b>imaging,</b> is still in its infancy. However, in preclinical studies, <b>ultrasonic</b> molecular <b>imaging</b> has shown promise in assessing angiogenesis, inflammation, and thrombus. In this review, we discuss recent advances in microbubble-type contrast agent development, ultrasound technology, and signal processing strategies that have the potential to substantially improve the capabilities and utility of <b>ultrasonic</b> molecular <b>imaging...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a J-groove {{dissimilar}} weld crack visualization {{system based on}} <b>ultrasonic</b> propagation <b>imaging</b> (UPI) technology. A full-scale control rod drive mechanism (CRDM) assembly specimen was fabricated to verify the proposed system. An ultrasonic sensor was contacted at one point of the inner surface of the reactor vessel head part of the CRDM assembly. Q-switched laser beams were scanned to generate ultrasonic waves around the weld bead. The localization and sizing of the crack were possible by <b>ultrasonic</b> wave propagation <b>imaging.</b> Furthermore, <b>ultrasonic</b> spectral <b>imaging</b> unveiled frequency components of damage-induced waves, while wavelet-transformed <b>ultrasonic</b> propagation <b>imaging</b> enhanced damage visibility by generating a wave propagation video focused on the frequency component of the damage-induced waves. Dual-directional anomalous wave propagation imaging with adjacent wave subtraction was also developed to enhance the crack visibility regardless of crack orientation and wave propagation direction. In conclusion, the full-scale specimen test demonstrated that the multiple damage visualization tools are very effective in the visualization of J-groove dissimilar weld cracks...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} two laser optoacoustic imaging {{systems for}} breast cancer detection based on arrays of acoustic detectors operated manually in a way similar to standard <b>ultrasonic</b> breast <b>imaging.</b> The systems have the advantages of standard light illumination (regardless of the interrogated part of the breast), the ability to visualize {{any part of the}} breast, and convenience in operation. The first system could work in both ultrasonic and optoacoustic mode, and was developed based on a linear <b>ultrasonic</b> breast <b>imaging</b> probe with two parallel rectangular optical bundles. We used it in a pilot clinical study to provide for the first time demonstration that the boundaries of the tumors visualized on the optoacoustic and ultrasonic images matched. Such correlation of coregistered images proves that the objects on both images represented indeed the same tumor. In the optoacoustic mode we were also able to visualize blood vessels located in the neighborhood of the tumor.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{study on the}} interaction of ultrasonic guided waves with delamination in the web-flange interface of a co-cured, co-bonded composite T-joint. A complex interaction of waves is induced, first, by one, and, later, by two piezoceramic wafer(s) bonded on the inner surface of the flange. The flange surface velocity distributions are reconstructed from the scanning laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV) measurements to study {{the effect of a}} delamination overlapping the web-flange interface. The surface-bonded piezoelectric actuator(s) placed remotely on the flange produce primarily anti-symmetric wave incidence to the delamination. A two-stage wave mode conversion process, one due to the web and joint filler, and the other due to the delamination underneath the flange is observed. First, we address the problem of identification of delamination by <b>ultrasonic</b> contrast <b>imaging</b> of the web-flange interface using a single actuator. This study is extended further to enhance the <b>ultrasonic</b> contrast <b>imaging</b> at the web-flange interface using a standing wave. A quantitative methodology based on mode conversion strength is developed to monitor different structural features like free-edge, web-flange interface and delamination. The results show the complex nature of the conversion of flexural waves to in-plane waves through the deltoid and along the web-flange interface. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
