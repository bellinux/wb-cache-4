25|$|Using {{vector control}} and strict {{vaccination}} programs, the <b>urban</b> <b>cycle</b> of yellow fever was nearly eradicated from South America. Since 1943, {{only a single}} urban outbreak in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, has occurred. Since the 1980s, though, the number of yellow fever cases has been increasing again, and A. aegypti {{has returned to the}} urban centers of South America. This is partly due to limitations on available insecticides, as well as habitat dislocations caused by climate change. It is also because the vector control program was abandoned. Although no new <b>urban</b> <b>cycle</b> has yet been established, scientists believe this could happen again at any point. An outbreak in Paraguay in 2008 was thought to be urban in nature, but this ultimately proved not to be the case.|$|E
25|$|Besides the <b>urban</b> <b>cycle,</b> both in Africa and South America, a sylvatic cycle (forest or jungle cycle) is present, where Aedes africanus (in Africa) or {{mosquitoes}} of {{the genus}} Haemagogus and Sabethes (in South America) serve as vectors. In the jungle, the mosquitoes infect mainly non-human primates; the disease is mostly asymptomatic in African primates. In South America, the sylvatic cycle is currently the only way humans can become infected, which explains the low incidence of yellow fever cases on the continent. People who become infected in the jungle can carry the virus to urban areas, where A. aegypti acts as a vector. Because of this sylvatic cycle, the yellow fever cannot be eradicated.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Integrated {{urban water}} {{management}} (IUWM) requires {{the management of}} the <b>urban</b> water <b>cycle</b> in sympathy with the hydrological water <b>cycle.</b> <b>Urban</b> systems significantly alter the hydrological water cycle. Under natural conditions the water inputs at any point in the landscape are precipitation and overland flows; while the outputs are via surface flows, evapo-transpiration and groundwater recharge. The large volumes of piped water introduced with the change to an urban setting and the introduction of vast impervious areas strongly impact on the water balance, increasing in-flows and dramatically altering the out-flow components. IUWM seeks to change the impact of urban development on the natural water cycle. One approach is to establish an inner, <b>urban,</b> water <b>cycle</b> loop through the implementation of reuse strategies. Developing this <b>urban</b> water <b>cycle</b> loop requires an understanding both of the natural, pre-development, water balance and the post-development water balance. Accounting for flows in the pre- and post-development systems is an important step toward limiting urban impacts on the natural water cycle. This paper investigates urban water balancing and preliminary identification of reuse strategies for the case study of the proposed Tamala Park development in Perth, as the first steps toward an integrated water reuse strategy. The hydrology and hydrogeology of the site are examined. Overland flows are not a feature of th...|$|R
