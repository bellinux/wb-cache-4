50|$|For example, {{a vehicle}} with an <b>unladen</b> <b>mass</b> of 2650 kg and a MAM of 4005 kg, with a trailer MAM of 2200 kg {{will give a}} {{combined}} MAM of 6205 kg - but the <b>Unladen</b> <b>Mass</b> of the vehicle being driven (2650 kg) {{is greater than the}} MAM of the trailer (2200 kg) so is acceptable. However, a vehicle with an <b>unladen</b> <b>mass</b> of 2650 kg and a MAM of 4005 kg, with a trailer MAM of 2700 kg will give a combined MAM of 6705 kg - but because the MAM of the trailer (2700 kg) exceeds the Unladen Weight of the vehicle being driven (2650 kg), you would need a Category D+E licence to drive that vehicle.|$|E

50|$|As {{its weight}} changes during riding, the dry {{weight of a}} {{motorcycle}} typically excludes the gasoline (or other fuel). Dry weight, in this sense, can directly be used for comparison with (FIM) weight limits, which pertain to the motorcycle in operating condition. It {{is also part of}} the homologation tests, and it is found on the EC Certificate of Conformity as <b>unladen</b> <b>mass.</b> This dry weight could also be useful in comparing different models, with different fuel tank capacities. However, manufacturers may also exclude {{some or all of the}} following: engine oil, coolant, or brake fluid, and this makes such a comparison difficult. When any of these is excluded, the specified dry weight no longer pertains to the motorcycle in running order. Some manufacturers even exclude the battery, notwithstanding the weight of the battery is mainly in solid components (usually lead), not liquid (electrolytes).|$|E
40|$|Considering the {{well-known}} {{features of the}} noise emitted by moving sources, a number of vehicle characteristics such as speed, <b>unladen</b> <b>mass,</b> engine size, year of registration, power and fuel were recorded in a dedicated monitoring campaign performed in three different places, each characterized by different number of lanes {{and the presence of}} nearby reflective surfaces. A full database of 144 vehicles (cars) was used to identify statistically relevant features. In order to compare the vehicle transit noise in different environmental condition, all 1 / 3 -octave band spectra were normalized and analysed. Unsupervised clustering algorithms were employed to group together spectrum levels with similar profiles. Our results corroborate {{the well-known}} fact that speed is the most relevant characteristic to discriminate between different vehicle noise spectrum. In keeping with this fact, we present a new approach to predict analytically noise spectra for a given vehicle speed. A set of speed-dependent analytical functions are suggested in order to fit the normalized average spectrum profile at different speeds. This approach can be useful for predicting vehicle speed based purely on its noise spectrum pattern. The present work is complementary to the accurate analysis of noise sources based on the beamforming technique...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Key {{factors that}} {{influence}} the energy consumption of heavy goods vehicles are inves-tigated. These factors include engine efficiency, aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance, vehicle configuration (number of vehicle units), traffic congestion, speed, payload factors, {{and the use of}} regenerative braking. An accurate, validated model of the fuel consumption of a 38 tonne tractor-semitrailer vehicle is used as a basis to derive fuel consumption models of a number of other vehicle configura-tions. These models included a rigid four-axle truck with maximum gross vehicle mass (GVM) of 26 tonnes; a six-axle tractor semitrailer with GVM of 44 tonnes, with and without regenerative braking; a ‘B-double ’ with GVM of 60 tonnes; and an ‘A-double ’ with GVM of 82 tonnes. These vehicle models were driven over a simple hypothetical drive cycle with a fixed maximum speed and varying numbers of stops in a 10 km stretch of road. It is concluded that: (a) improving engine efficiency, <b>unladen</b> <b>mass,</b> rolling resistance, and aerodynamic drag can yield relatively small improvements in fuel consumption, compared with other factors; (b) larger vehicles are always significantly more energy-efficient than smaller ones when fully loaded; (c) transferring freight from articulated vehicles to smaller rigid vehicles for urban deliveries typically increases fuel consumption by approximately 35 per cent; (d) running vehicles partially loaded can increase the energy per unit freight task by up to 65 per cent; and (e) under urban start–stop conditions, the use of regenerative braking systems can reduce heavy vehicle fuel consumption by 25 – 35 per cent...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{interest}} for smaller, cheaper and more energy efficient vehicles hasincreased significantly. These vehicles are intended {{to be used in}} urban areas, where theactual need of large heavy cars is generally minor. The travelled distance is on average lessthan 56 km during a day and most often there is only one person travelling in the vehicle. Manyof the established car manufacturers have recently started to take interest into this marketsegment, but the majority of these small vehicles are still manufactured by smaller companiesat a low cost and with little or no research done on vehicle traffic safety. This may be becausethere are still no legal requirements on crash testing of this type of vehicles. This report will examine road safety for Urban Light-weight Vehicle (ULV) to find criticalcrash scenarios from which future crash testing methods for urban vehicles can be derived. The term ULV is specific to this report and is the title for all engine powered three- and fourwheeledvehicles categorized by the European Commission. Other attributes than the wheelgeometry is engine power and the vehicles <b>unladen</b> <b>mass.</b> The maximum allowed weight for athree-wheeled ULV is 1 000 kg and 400 kg for a four-wheeled one. By studying current crash test methods used in Europe by Euro NCAP it has beenconcluded that these tests are a good way of assessing car safety. For light-weight urbanvehicles it has been concluded that some of these tests need to be changed and that some newtest scenarios should be added when assessing road safety. The main reasons for this is linkedto that vehicle’s with a weight difference of more than 150 kg cannot be compared withcurrent test methods, and that crash tests are performed with crash objects with similar orequal mass in current safety assessment programs. This correlates poorly to the trafficsituation for light-weight urban vehicles since it would most likely collide with a far heaviervehicle than itself in an accident event. To verify the actual traffic situation in urban areas, accident statistics have beenexamined closely. The research has shown that there are large differences between rural andurban areas. For instance; 66 % of all severe and fatal traffic accident occurs in rural areaseven though they are less populated. Even the distribution of accident categories has showndifferent in rural and urban areas. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe(UNECE) has defined accident categories in their database which is widely used within theEuropean Union. By comparing each accident category’s occurrence, injury and fatality rate,the most critical urban accident categories were found in the following order. 1. Collision due to crossing or turning 2. Vehicle and pedestrian collision 3. Rear-end collision 4. Single-vehicle accident 5. Other collisions 6. Head-on collision Statistics also show that of all fatally injured crash victims in urban trafficapproximately; one third is travelling by car; one third by motorcycle, moped or pedal-cycle;and one third are pedestrians. This means that unprotected road travelers correspond to twothirds of all fatal urban traffic accidents, a fact that has {{to be taken into account}} in future crashtesting of urban vehicles. With all the information gathered a total of four new crash testscenarios for light-weight urban vehicles have been presented: • Vehicle-to-vehicle side impact at 40 km/h with a 1 300 kg striking vehicle to evaluate theoccupant protection level of the light-weight vehicle. • Vehicle-to-motorcycle side impact at 40 km/h with motorcycle rider protection evaluation. • Pedestrian protection assessment at 40 km/h over the whole vehicle front and roof area. • Rigid barrier impact at 40 km/h corresponding to an urban single vehicle accident with aroad side object or a collision with a heavier or similar sized vehicle...|$|E
