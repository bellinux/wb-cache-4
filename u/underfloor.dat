5|$|Both {{versions}} use {{a common}} airframe, with three Rolls-Royce Turbomeca RTM322 engines, their range and endurance using only a two engine cruise option, is , or six hours. However, range {{can be extended}} further when the five <b>underfloor</b> fuel tanks are supplemented with auxiliary fuel tanks fitted in the cabin. Armament depends on mission, but includes anti-ship missiles, torpedoes, three door-mounted machine guns, multi-purpose rocket, cannon pods, air-to-air missiles and air-to-surface missiles. At least 14 Merlin HM2s will be assigned to the carrier.|$|E
5|$|The long, rectilinear, two-storey building, had {{a double}} {{cantilevered}} frame supported {{on a single}} row of concrete columns. These columns tilted outwards from a vertical position. Floor to ceiling glazing on the second storey opened out onto a balcony running {{the length of the}} building. It included technical innovations from America including acoustic ceiling tiles, <b>underfloor</b> electricity ducts and fluorescent lighting.|$|E
5|$|Some teams made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the Grand Prix. Williams, Jaguar, Ferrari, Sauber and Prost all brought updated front wings. Ferrari also introduced a new <b>underfloor</b> and brought more powerful versions of their V10 engines for qualifying and the race. Williams installed extra cooling on their cars to combat high temperatures in qualifying. Minardi planned to introduce a new revision to their cars aerodynamic package which included a new engine cover, a titanium gearbox and rear suspension geometry. The team decided to only test the gearbox during the first free practice session.|$|E
5|$|Hot springs {{have been}} used for bathing at least since Paleolithic times. The oldest known spa is a stone pool on China's Lisan {{mountain}} built in the Qin Dynasty in the 3rd century BC, at the same site where the Huaqing Chi palace was later built. In the first century AD, Romans conquered Aquae Sulis, now Bath, Somerset, England, and used the hot springs there to feed public baths and <b>underfloor</b> heating. The admission fees for these baths probably represent the first commercial use of geothermal power. The world's oldest geothermal district heating system in Chaudes-Aigues, France, has been operating since the 14th century. The earliest industrial exploitation began in 1827 with the use of geyser steam to extract boric acid from volcanic mud in Larderello, Italy.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 {{the fourth}} bell {{of the ring}} of six was recast, again by the Whitechapel Foundry. By the 1990s the {{internal}} design of the church was beginning to be considered impractical {{for the needs of}} the community, and the interior was remodelled to a design by Robert Potter, with the works carried out in 1999. The west gallery was restored to house the 1852 organ, together with a kitchen and toilet facility, and the north transept was converted into a vestry with a room above it. <b>Underfloor</b> heating was built below a new marble floor and the chancel step replaced by an ovoid raised marble dais. Meanwhile, Scott's pews were removed altogether and replaced by wooden chairs.|$|E
5|$|Next to {{the south}} {{entrance}} to the park is the Bärenzwinger (bear pit). This was built in 193839 {{on the site of}} a former sanitation depot, also designed by Ludwig Hoffmann and already decorated with more than 50 plaques by Otto Lessing depicting bears, and a public lavatory, and opened on 17 August 1939. It consists of indoor sleeping quarters and outdoor exercise areas which have held as many as five bears (the armorial animal of Berlin) who are the official bears or mascots of the city. The impetus for building the Bärenzwinger was a letter to the newspaper Berliner Zeitung am Mittag (now B.Z.) from Wilfried Bade which appeared the day {{after the end of the}} celebration of the city's 700-year anniversary, and the Lord Mayor, Julius Lippert, had it completed despite objections from some Nazi functionaries that there were more important things to be done in what proved to be the run-up to World War II. Two of the original bears were gifts from Bern, which also has a bear on its arms. It remains largely unchanged, although it had to be reconstructed after the war; it reopened in 1949 with two new bears, again from Bern; one of these, Jente, produced 33 cubs (including 4 sets of triplets and 9 pairs of twins) before being retired to the zoo. The last official city bear, Schnute, lived there until her death in 2015; her daughter Maxi also lived there until her death in August 2013. The Bärenzwinger is a listed Berlin landmark. It was threatened with closure in 1990 due to lack of funds for needed modernisation, but after public protest, the Berlin Senate undertook to pay for the project. <b>Underfloor</b> heating in the cages and a skylight dome were added, and the electricity supply was overhauled. The facility reopened in 1993 and celebrated its 70th anniversary in 2009. Some animal protection advocates, including the city's own animal protection officer, have called for it to be closed as oldfashioned and inhumane.|$|E
25|$|An {{optional}} {{third row}} seat increased occupant capacity from 5 to 7 seats while reducing <b>underfloor</b> storage {{space in the}} trunk.|$|E
25|$|Four railcars entered {{service on}} the NCC's lines between 1933 and 1938. They were all {{double-ended}} single units with <b>underfloor</b> engines and running on two four-wheel bogies.|$|E
25|$|PRR coach 542 is {{currently}} abandoned derelict (and is missing trucks and <b>underfloor</b> equipment) in Hiltons, Virginia, {{at the intersection}} of 709 (Mandolin Drive) and 712 (A P Carter Hwy).|$|E
25|$|Major repairs were {{undertaken}} in 1994, to stabilise the south transept with a ring beam and {{to strengthen its}} roof and to repoint the tower and pinnacles. An <b>underfloor</b> heating system was installed.|$|E
25|$|Taking {{suitcases}} {{into the}} cabin, as in trains, was studied, but necessitated a 3m fuselage extension with a 350-seat capacity. To avoid this, passengers were to deposit their luggage in <b>underfloor</b> compartments {{as they entered}} the airliner.|$|E
25|$|During Roman {{occupation}} {{the countryside}} close to Verulamium was subdivided {{into a series}} of farming estates. The Berkhamsted area appears to have been divided into two or three farming estates, each including one or more masonry villa buildings, with tiled roofs and <b>underfloor</b> heating.|$|E
25|$|The sole Leyland Panda entered {{service with}} Walter Alexander in 1941, {{it had an}} <b>underfloor</b> engine, like the FEC, but lacked the forward {{entrance}} of that operator's Gnus, it was bodied by Alexander with 45 seats and a central entrance to a semi-utility outline.|$|E
25|$|Air {{quality and}} air flow— An {{innovative}} <b>underfloor</b> {{air distribution system}} allows fresh air {{to move into the}} building while pushing stale air to the ceiling. This air is then collected in air ducts and circulated outside, providing healthy and comfortable air for occupants.|$|E
25|$|These new DMUs {{have better}} {{acceleration}} than the HST {{due to a}} higher power/weight ratio, with greater efficiency and braking performance in addition. However, passenger comfort is reduced due to the vibrations and noise caused by the <b>underfloor</b> engines, compared to the much quieter Mark 3 coaches.|$|E
25|$|The {{passenger}} trailers {{were each}} 55 feet long while the parcel trailers were 42 feet long. All cars featured a full-length side skirt below the floor level, partially coverying the bogies and <b>underfloor</b> equipment. They were all {{painted in the}} same silver and blue livery as the power cars.|$|E
25|$|The InterCity 125 {{is still}} in {{widespread}} use. First Great Western planned to supplement (but not replace) its InterCity 125s with 14 Class 180 Adelante trains, which can travel at the same speed. Because every carriage has an <b>underfloor</b> engine, they can accelerate approximately twice as quickly, which reduces journey times and allows for more frequent services. However, in-car noise levels are {{higher than in the}} InterCity 125 because of the <b>underfloor</b> engines, which, combined with less-comfortable seats and harsh interior lighting, has made them unpopular with passengers. They also proved to be unreliable, leading to a significant overhaul programme in 2004 to fix the major problems. These issues ultimately led to the units being withdrawn from First Great Western services and transferred to open access operators Grand Central and Hull Trains.|$|E
25|$|The 2600 Class were {{effectively}} {{identical to}} the GNR(I) cars in overall configuration, having a full-width driver's cab at one end, a gangway at the other, and <b>underfloor</b> engines. Their bodywork was conventional for CIÉ stock of the time, consisting of steel panels on timber framing. The underframe was of steel channel construction.|$|E
25|$|One {{variation}} is using tubes filled with circulating hot water as heat source for warming the floor. The heating principle remains the same. Both old style electric and warm water (hydronic) <b>underfloor</b> heating systems {{embedded in the}} floor construction are slow and cannot respond to external weather changes or internal demand/lifestyle requirements.|$|E
25|$|The {{accident}} triggered {{an investigation}} of the Lockheed L-109C Flight Data Recorder which resulted in modifications of that device and revision of the standards for all recorders. Also addressed were potential problems with the Pyrene Duo Head Model DCD-10 for the <b>underfloor</b> baggage and heater compartments. There was an Airworthiness Directive issued. Revisions were made to the Pilot's Manual, Viscount Maintenance and Instruction, and Accessories Manuals.|$|E
25|$|When {{residents}} {{moved into}} their new homes, most were {{pleased with the}} improvement. However, the demolition of the slums and breaking up of entire communities had made people feel unsettled in their new homes. The modern features meant that residents had to adapt, for example, residents were now paying for <b>underfloor</b> heating when {{they were used to}} cheaper coal fires. Many residents resented being moved and were unhappy within their new homes.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, Lindsey Archaeological Services were {{commissioned}} by Welby Parochial Church Council {{to provide a}} watching brief on an archaeological investigation before <b>underfloor</b> heating was installed. Pews and pew platforms were removed, and investigation trenches dug under flagstone floors in the north aisle, and {{the north and south}} sides of the nave. Finds included remains of a previous lime mortar floor, stained glass and window lead fragments, pottery of the 15th to 19th centuries, some graves, and shroud pins.|$|E
25|$|The {{cooling system}} was based around a high-efficiency {{air-cooled}} condensing chiller. Each office was provided {{with its own}} thermal controls, from the mechanicals of the compartmentalized four-pipe and two-pipe fan-coil <b>underfloor</b> air distribution system, allowing ventilated air to be warmer and cleaner, to the operable windows and shades, so that occupants could work at their own comfort levels. Occupancy sensors shut off ventilation when no one is present. If these measures worked as planned, the total cooling load capacity would be only 29 watts per square metre (2.6 per square foot), and the building would see a 45% improvement over American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) energy-use standards.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{introduced}} on the EM/ET class sets, {{several of}} the DM/D sets refurbished for the Johnsonville Branch were later repainted in this livery during the late 1980s. The car body was repainted in olive green with a grey roof and black <b>underfloor</b> equipment and running gear. A white band surrounded the windows {{on the sides of}} the car, ending between the first passenger window and the driver's cab window. The doors and ends were painted yellow with white block numbers and classification letters on the side and black numbers on the '1' and '2' ends of the train. The cab windows and headlight mounting were painted with a black surround.|$|E
25|$|Twenty-four {{coaches were}} built for {{push-pull}} operation on the suburban rail service including 5 built to Control Cars (6101–05, 6301–19). Originally {{used in conjunction}} with the 121 Class locomotives they were last used with 201 Class locomotives. There were a number of differences between the Irish push-pull Mark 3's and the standard Mark 3's. An <b>underfloor</b> generator, mounted in the Control Car, provided electrical power to the coaches; unlike on the standard Mark 3's, which used a special generator van. This single generator was not as powerful as the two used in the Mark 3 generator vans and was the main reason the sets were limited to 6 cars. Irish Mark 3 push-pull based rolling stock did not have air conditioning and had opening windows instead. There was also a 70mph speed restriction imposed on the train {{due to the fact that}} three of the Control Cars were fitted with LHB bogies from an 8100 Class DART. and were air-braked.|$|E
25|$|An {{electric}} <b>underfloor</b> {{heating system}} has heating cables {{embedded in the}} floor. Current flows through a conductive heating material, supplied either directly from the line voltage (120 or 240 volts) or at low voltage from a transformer. The heated cables warm the flooring by direct conduction and will switch off once it reaches the temperature set by the floor thermostat. A warmer floor surface radiates heat to colder surrounding surfaces (ceiling, walls, furniture.) which absorb heat and reflects all non absorbed heat to yet other still cooler surfaces. The cycle of radiation, absorption and reflection starts slowly and slows down slowly nearing set point temperatures and ceases to take place once equilibrium is reached all-round. A floor thermostat or a room thermostat or combination controls the floor on/off. In the process of radiant heating {{a thin layer of}} air which is in touch with the warmed surfaces also absorbs some heat and this creates a little convection (air circulation). Contrary to believe people are not heated by this warmed circulating air or convection (convection has a cooling effect) but are heated by the direct radiation of the source and reflection of its surrounds.|$|E
25|$|All DT3 {{units are}} {{equipped}} with passenger intercom panels near every door {{in addition to the}} standard emergency brakes and emergency door release handles. Controllers can access CCTV cameras in every unit from the control centre through a Wireless LAN link installed in all tunnels that are used by DT3 trains. Flame-retardant materials are used wherever possible. Temperature sensors and smoke detectors are spread throughout every unit in the passenger space and in every <b>underfloor</b> machinery compartment to detect possible fires as early as possible. Circuit integrity retaining electrical cables (cables that can keep their insulation for a certain time in the presence of fire) are used to allow a unit to proceed to the next station in case of a fire. German regulations mandate that all subway trains must not stop inside a tunnel after the emergency brake has been pulled or if any other hazard like a fire is detected, but instead should proceed to the next station if possible to ease rescue operations. Since the longest travel time between two stations on the Nuremberg U-Bahn is about 3 Minutes (between Ziegelstein and Flughafen) and most stations are less than 60 seconds apart, this is deemed a superior option to stopping inside a tunnel, where evacuation, rescue and firefighting attempts would be much more difficult than on a station platform.|$|E
500|$|As the A321-100 {{range was}} reduced {{compared}} to the A320, the heavier and longer range A321-200 development was launched in 1995. This is achieved through higher thrust engines (V2533-A5 or CFM56-5B3), minor structural strengthening, {{and an increase in}} fuel capacity with the installation of one or two optional [...] tanks in the rear <b>underfloor</b> hold.

500|$|The first {{specifications}} for the TA9 and TA11, aircraft that could accommodate 410 passengers in a one-class layout, emerged in 1982. They showed a large <b>underfloor</b> cargo area that could hold five cargo pallets or sixteen LD3 cargo containers in the forward, and four pallets or fourteen LD3s in the aft hold—double {{the capacity of}} the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar or DC-10, and [...] longer than the Airbus A300. By June 1985, the TA9 and TA11 had received more improvements, including the adoption of the A320 flight deck, digital fly-by-wire (FBW) control system, and side-stick control. Airbus had developed a common cockpit for their aircraft models to allow quick transition by pilots. [...] The flight crews could transition from one type to another after only one week's training, which reduces operator costs. The two TAs would use the vertical stabiliser, rudder, and circular fuselage sections of the A300-600, extended by two barrel sections.|$|E
500|$|To {{the west}} of the mansio lay the public bath-house, {{separated}} from it by a cobbled road between [...] wide. From the street, a paved area led into a colonnade fronting the building on the east and continuing round the north side. Large doors in the centre of the eastern colonnade opened into a large, covered courtyard. This courtyard may have been a basilica; a settlement of this size would be expected to have one, and this is the only candidate on the site. At the far north end of the bath complex was the stoke-room or praefurnium, which contained the wood-fired furnaces of the hypocaust system. This <b>underfloor</b> heating system was present in the tepidarium, the caldarium and the laconicum where the floors were supported on pillars of tiles or pilae. The hot combustion gases from the stoke-room furnaces circulated under the floor between these pillars and were drawn up around the sides of the building through box tiles embedded in the walls, to escape finally through vents in the barrel-vaulted roof.|$|E

2500|$|This livery {{was applied}} to set DM 147 by Tranz Rail's {{suburban}} operator Tranz Metro during the late 1990s, and was the only unit to wear this livery. The car body was painted in the standard Tranz Rail [...] "Cato Blue" [...] with a grey roof, yellow ends and headlight mount, and black <b>underfloor</b> equipment and running gear. The doors were unpainted aluminium while there were two black bands on the car body, one at floor level separating the running gear and <b>underfloor</b> equipment from the [...] "Cato Blue" [...] body and the other at roof level separating the grey roof from the blue body.|$|E
