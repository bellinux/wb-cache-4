40|$|A Focused Electric Field Imprinting (FEFI) {{process and}} {{apparatus}} provides a focused electric field to guide an <b>unplating</b> operation and/or a plating operation to form very fine-pitched metal patterns on a substrate. The {{process is a}} variation of the electrochemical <b>unplating</b> process, wherein the process is modified for imprinting range of patterns of around 2000 microns to 20 microns or less in width, and from about 0. 1 microns or less to 10 microns or more in depth. Some embodiments curve a proton-exchange membrane whose shape is varied using suction on a backing fluid through a support mask. Other embodiments use a curved electrode. Mask-membrane interaction parameters and process settings vary the feature size, which can generate sub- 100 -nm features. The feature-generation process is parallelized, and a stepped sequence of such FEFI operations, can generate sub- 100 nm lines with sub- 100 nm spacing.

Johnson used a 100w Marshall tube amplifier with EL34 power tubes (he liked the German brand Siemens made by RFT), with a 4x12 cabinet wired in vintage style series-parallel 8-ohm total load (vs 16-ohm total load stock). Four x 8-ohm speakers instead of four x 16-ohm speakers like original wired cabs. Very late 1970s or early 1980s G1280 80-watt speakers at the time, similar to modern-day [...] "Lead 80" [...] speakers although a bit different. Speaker wires soldered to the speaker terminals, not the connector type plugs. He also prefers <b>unplated</b> plain brass plugs on his guitar cables preferably the Bill Lawrence, or second choice <b>unplated</b> plain Brass George L's in his lead tone signal. He prefers their warmer tone vs. nickel, chrome or gold-plated, although he likes the brighter nickel-plated plugs in his clean rhythm signal chain. His vintage Strats are also mildly modded to have the tone control wired to the bridge instead of the middle Pickup and usually leaves the back plastic plate off the back. This helps with changing the strings faster, is able to bang on the springs and create feed back, and [...] "sounds better that way" [...] probably because of less damping from the plastic, for a more open tone. He also doesn't like to run the G and B strings through the string tree, so wraps them in a carefully locking way around the tuners, and wraps {{them all the way}} down on those strings to correct the angle. It gives better tuning for less friction, and different tonality. Early 1950s to early and mid-1960s Strats were wired with a [...] "phonebook" [...] style [...]1uf (micro-farad) capacitor instead of the more common and modern [...]022uf, and [...]047uf.

50|$|Gauge blocks {{are usually}} made either from {{hardened}} alloy tool steels or from cemented carbides (such as tungsten carbide or tantalum carbide). Often the carbide has a hardness of 1500 Vickers hardness. Long series blocks {{are made from}} high-quality steel having cross section (35 Ã— 9 mm) with holes for clamping two slips together.

The hardness {{is important because it}} slows down the gauge's rate of wear during use (this is why other kinds of gauges, such as pins, thread plugs, and rings, are also hardened.) The cutting of the blocks to size is accomplished with grinding followed by lapping. Usually no plating or other coating is involved.

In the present investigation, the attenuation by iron foil of a characteristic line from either silver or zirconium as substrate has been measured in a spectrograph rovided with a good collimator and with an analyzing crystal. The results, when corrected for back-ground, show that the exponential absorption law is followed closely.
