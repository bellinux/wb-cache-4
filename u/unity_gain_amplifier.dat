30|$|The {{most widely}} used {{ground-based}} sensors for the air-Earth current measurements are: Wilson plate (Israel, 1973), the horizontal long-wire antenna (Ruhnke, 1969), horizontal passive antenna (Harrison, 1996) and spherical shell {{in the form of}} two hollow hemispheres (Burke and Few, 1978). The horizontal long wire antenna, if placed in the atmosphere, will closely follow the electrical current variations of the atmosphere after the initial net charge on the antenna leaks off. When the antenna is shorted to the ground through a resistor, it will generate a voltage that is proportional to the air-Earth current. In the present experimental setup, a long wire of length 41.5 m and thickness 3 mm is kept horizontally stretched parallel to the ground at a height of 1.2 m. The wire is mechanically supported by means of masts. By using teflon rods at their ends it is ensured that the antenna wire is electrically insulated from the supporting masts. The input is fed through the electrometer (Model AD 549) that has high input impedance and permits extremely low input bias current (10 – 14 A). The electrometer measures the current up to 1 nA (corresponding to the output voltages whose limit is ± 5 V) with a feedback resistance of 5 × 109 Ω. A <b>unity</b> <b>gain</b> operational <b>amplifier</b> (LM 308) amplifies the electrometer output signal. The amplified signal is then taken in a shielded cable over a distance of 10 m to the control room where it is fed to a PC-based data logger.

The project included design of a wafer-prober and solar-simulator combination so that large area wafers (up to 8 inch in diameter) could be tested at/up to AM 1. 5 standard solar insolation. Rather than simply looking at the short circuit current and the open circuit voltage of a solar cell, our system measures its full I-V characteristics while the cell is irradiated with an artificial light source which simulates the solar radiation. The artificial sunlight is created by combining metal-halide and quartz halogen light sources.

40|$|In {{this project}} a {{low-pass}} filter for UWB applications is designed. The desired specification of the filter are; a - 3 dB point at 255 MHz, and - 40 dB at 800 MHz. Chosen is {{to design a}} 4 th order butterworth filter, designed with a double biquad multiple feedback topology. For this filter an amplifier is designed. The amplifier is a folded cascode op amp. The amplifier needs a high <b>unity</b> <b>gain</b> bandwidth, for a good filter response. The <b>unity</b> <b>gain</b> bandwidth is 830 MHz, but is still not enough for the 255 MHz low-pass filter. The <b>gain</b> of the <b>amplifier</b> at low frequencies is 37 dB and the first pole is at 15 MHz.
