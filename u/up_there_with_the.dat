500|$|The show {{received}} a mixed reception from media publications. Some media outlets were {{more critical of}} the show and Rock's performance as host. USA Today television critic Robert Bianco wrote, [...] "Loud, snide and dismissive, he wasn't just a disappointment; he ranks <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> worst hosts ever." [...] He also called the decision to have several nominees of several technical categories stand on stage embarrassing and disrespectful. Columnist Robert. P. Lawrence of the San Diego Union Tribune commented, [...] "It was a frustratingly average, three-hour-12-minute exhibition of mutual admiration in the inimitable Hollywood style." [...] He later said that despite Rock's edgy and provocative opening, his humor and energy diminished as the night wore on. Vince Horiuchi of The Salt Lake Tribune wrote of Rock's [...] performance, [...] "He was bound by stale jokes (none of the winners [...] "tested positive for steroids"), a rigid opening monologue (he didn't even make reference to his prior controversial comments about the Oscars), and tired comedy bits (Rock playing like Catherine Zeta-Jones with Adam Sandler)." [...] In addition, he also described the cast and production of the ceremony as [...] "moribund" [...] and [...] "clumsy." ...|$|E

Jessica Letkemann of Billboard points out that to those unfamiliar with Finn's solo work expecting the album to resemble a prior Crowded House work would be surprised, insisting that [...] "Gone are the more overtly '80s top 40 flourishes". Bud Scoppa writes in Uncut Magazine that the album's extremes are portrayed in its first two songs, [...] "Nobody Wants To", which he describes as [...] " [...] the prevailing melancholy mood, as Finn's slide guitar hovers like a solitary seabird over a vocal laced with regret", and [...] "Don't Stop Now", in which [...] "Finn explores the metaphorical possibilities of the GPS, seeking [...] "something I can write about… something I can cry about"".|$|E
500|$|... "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] has {{garnered}} positive {{reviews from}} both film and music critics, {{some of whom}} even identified it as the film's best song.

Writing for Indiewire, Greg Ehbar cited [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] as his favorite, describing the song {{as one of the}} film's [...] "truly great tunes". Ella Ceron of Thought Catalog called the song [...] "a pop song made on Olympus." [...] Irving Tan of Sputnikmusic was especially kind towards the song, which he hailed as [...] "the ultimate pantheon of Grecian achievement". Tan continued, [...] "the five Muses prov that their pillow talk skills are right <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> best of them", concluding, [...] "The track also works well as an alternative to modern pop's teenage heartbreak music ... be sure to ditch Hilary Duff and play this instead". Tracy Dye of Bustle hailed the song as [...] "one of Disney's most addictive pieces of ear-candy," [...] appreciating the fact that [...] "it veers from the typical love-laced ballads we're used to."

500|$|He made a full {{recovery}} from his injuries in time for Born in the U.S.A. (1984), which featured an aerobics-timed beat on some tracks that also owed something to the popular Phil Collins drum sound. [...] Weinberg's own experimentation since the Darkness days had also led to a more reverberant sound. Overall, Weinberg's more fluid drumming combined with Roy Bittan's use of synthesizers and better overall production to give Springsteen a more modern sound, resulting in the album becoming Springsteen's best-selling one ever and spawning a record-tying seven Top 10 hit singles. Springsteen later said of the album, [...] "Max {{was the best thing}} on the record." [...] Weinberg's most well-known drum part came on [...] "Born in the U.S.A.", where his snare drum paired against Bittan's signature synthesizer riff on the opening and throughout {{the main part of the}} song. The recording then descends into improvised chaos; Springsteen had told Weinberg, [...] "When I stop, keep the drums going." [...] Upon the restart, intentional drum breakdowns matched bass swoops and guitar feedback; Springsteen subsequently said of the performance overall, [...] "You can hear Max – to me, he was right <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> best of them on that song." [...] Weinberg said it was one of his most intense musical experiences.|$|E

500|$|In 1969 the Glens Natural Area {{was named}} a National Natural Landmark, {{and it became a}} Pennsylvania State Park Natural Area in 1993, which {{guarantees}} it [...] "will be protected and maintained in a natural state". In 1996 heavy rains washed out two bridges on the Falls Trail; because of the difficulty of transporting materials on the trail, an Army National Guard helicopter dropped 36-foot (11m) poles into the glens to rebuild the bridges in early 1997. In the winter of 1997 ice climbing was allowed in the Ganoga Glen section of the park for the first time. That same year local fire companies trained to rescue people injured in the park when icy conditions make reaching and transporting them treacherous. In 1998 a four-year project to [...] "repair and improve the Falls Trail" [...] began, with three park employees carrying materials in on foot to stabilize the trail, fix steps, reduce erosion, and repair some bridges. In 2001, John Young in Hike Pennsylvania: An Atlas of Pennsylvania's Greatest Hiking Adventures wrote of the Falls Trail: [...] "This is not only the most magnificent hike in the state, but it ranks <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> top hikes in the East."

[...] Alan Sepinwall from HitFix who is not a fan of Elaine Stritch's role on the show enjoyed her in this episode, writing that along with the appearances of Elizabeth Banks and Alan Alda [...] "I decided to hope their presence would counteract my feelings about hers – which is pretty much what happened."
