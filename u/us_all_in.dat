500|$|Many reviews {{criticized the}} Andy-Erin plot. White wrote that, [...] "If the Andy and Erin scenes in this episode were {{supposed}} to make me root for them, I'm afraid it didn't quite work." [...] Dougherty wrote, [...] "Was anyone else rooting for Erin to just stay down there? I certainly was." [...] McNutt bluntly wrote, [...] "I'm not buying this relationship." [...] The WHTC review noted that the arc was [...] "a total carbon copy of the Jim/Pam version that sucked <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> years ago." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{seeing the}} first three episodes, Maxwell Zachs called the series [...] "a disappointment". One reason for this, he says, is that {{although}} [...] "we see... lovely, endearing transsexuals" [...] portrayed in the show, [...] "what I don’t see is anything {{that is going to}} make people think or feel any differently about what gender is or how it limits <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> one way or another." [...] He lamented that their expressions of nuance in gender identity and discussions of genderqueerness were absent from the broadcast edit of the show.|$|E

He gave Harrison an upside-down plastic globe {{of the world}} and said: [...] "George, the globe I am giving you symbolizes the world today. I hope you will help <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> the task of putting it right." [...] Harrison immediately turned the globe to its correct position, shouting, [...] "I've done it!" [...] (Harrison [...] "affectionately" [...] referred to the Maharishi as the [...] "Big M"). On 8 April, the Maharishi gave an Indian prince's outfit to the Lennons for their son in England on his birthday. McCartney was uncomfortable with the Maharishi's flattery, including calling the band [...] "the blessed leaders of the world's youth".|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Hudema was {{spokesperson}} of a {{group of}} about twenty people who staged a sit-in at the constituency office of Justice Minister Anne McLellan to protest the government's proposed anti-terrorism and security laws, which Hudema claimed would [...] "greatly impinge on civil liberties in Canada." [...] The group [...] "evicted" [...] McLellan from her office - moving her furniture to the front lawn - changed her sign to read [...] "Minister of In-Justice", held community workshops and forums in the area, and set up a hot tub with a banner that read [...] "these bills put <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> hot water". After four days, Hudema {{and the rest of the}} protesters were removed by police and charged with trespassing.|$|E
500|$|James was ambitious {{to build}} on the {{personal}} union of the Crowns of Scotland and England to establish a single country under one monarch, one parliament, and one law, a plan that met opposition in both realms. [...] "Hath He not made <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> one island," [...] James told the English Parliament, [...] "compassed with one sea and of itself by nature indivisible?" [...] In April 1604, however, the Commons refused his request to be titled [...] "King of Great Britain" [...] on legal grounds. In October 1604, he assumed the title [...] "King of Great Britain" [...] by proclamation rather than by statute, though Sir Francis Bacon told him that he could not use the style in [...] "any legal proceeding, instrument or assurance" [...] and the title was not used on English statutes. James forced the Parliament of Scotland to use it, and it was used on proclamations, coinage, letters, and treaties in both realms.|$|E

500|$|In {{attempting}} {{to apply the}} Near and Pentagon Papers standards, the court {{was concerned about the}} prospect of publication causing the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and potentially a global nuclear holocaust. The government did not {{go so far as to}} claim that publication might pose an immediate or inevitable danger, only that it [...] "would substantially increase the risk that thermonuclear weapons would become available or available at an earlier date to those who do not now have them. If this should occur, it would undermine our nonproliferation policy, irreparably impair the national security of the United States, and pose a threat to the peace and security of the world." [...] However, the court still found that [...] "a mistake in ruling against the United States could pave the way for thermonuclear annihilation for <b>us</b> <b>all.</b> <b>In</b> that event, our right to life is extinguished and the right to publish becomes moot", and that publication could indeed cause [...] "grave, direct, immediate and irreparable harm to the United States", thereby meeting the test the Supreme Court had enunciated in the Pentagon Papers case. The preliminary injunction was therefore granted.|$|E
500|$|At the BFI London Film Festival, Nagy {{said she}} titled the film Carol, not The Price of Salt, because Highsmith herself {{had changed the}} title to Carol when the novel was republished, and she also [...] "liked the sort of strange, obsessive nature of calling it by someone's name." [...] There were later other discussions with Haynes. Haynes said that the film is called Carol because the novel [...] "is locked into the {{subjectivity}} of the younger woman" [...] and Carol is [...] "really the object of desire in the story." [...] "There's an element of, something aloof ... something unsettled about , that puts Therese and these new feelings ... on edge {{throughout much of the}} film. That relationship of who's the object and who's the subject does shift in the story, but it made sense ultimately that that would be the name for the film." [...] On the universal theme of the story, Haynes said [...] "the real determining question is not whether society will accept [...] feelings or not; it's, will this person return her love or not? ... That is what transcends the class of love, or the period in which it's occurring, and makes it something that just humbles us all and levels <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> the throes of those experiences that most of us have." ...|$|E
500|$|The show's {{crew and}} actors had {{a range of}} {{opinions}} about the show's finale, [...] "The Truth". Carter said of the finale, [...] "It's the end—you don't get another chance. So you'd better put everything you've ever wanted to put in into the episode. There were things to distract from what was going on. The band was breaking up." [...] Gish said, [...] "It did feel like a big movie set. We were on location, there was an enormous budget, and everyone came back." [...] Davis said, [...] "It was great that they brought us all back in the finale, that they {{found a way to}} get <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> again." [...] Pileggi said, [...] "I can remember the last day on the set. We shot a scene with Gillian and myself, and that was it. And then I had to say goodbye to another family, another crew. I almost teared up, and Gillian was standing there looking at me saying 'Okay, go ahead, big guy; get through this.' It was tough." [...] Patrick said, [...] "It was pretty euphoric, and sad, and all those emotions you can imagine. A chapter's closing, and we're all moving on to something new and exciting. And yet we were all going to miss each other." [...] Kim Manners called the final scene [...] "truly one of the most emotional experiences I've ever witnessed in my life." [...] Former lead actor Duchovny said, [...] "In some ways, psychically I didn't really leave. It was {{nice to be able to}} – I'm just really happy that I was able to come back and finish it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The philosopher Michel Foucault, in his {{preface to}} Anti-Oedipus, {{writes that the}} book can best be read as an [...] "art", {{in the sense that}} is {{conveyed}} by the term [...] "erotic art." [...] Foucault sees the three [...] "adversaries" [...] of Anti-Oedipus as being the [...] "bureaucrats of the revolution", the [...] "poor technicians of desire" [...] (psychoanalysts and semiologists), and fascism, which Foucault calls [...] "the major enemy". Foucault uses the term [...] "fascism" [...] to refer [...] "not only historical fascism, the fascism of Hitler and Mussolini...but also the fascism in <b>us</b> <b>all,</b> <b>in</b> our heads and in our everyday behavior, the fascism that causes us to love power, to desire the very thing that dominates and exploits us." [...] Foucault adds that Anti-Oedipus is [...] "a book of ethics, the first book of ethics to be written in France in quite a long time", and that this perhaps its popular success. Foucault suggests that the book could be called Introduction to the Non-Fascist Life. Foucault argues that putting the principles espoused in Anti-Oedipus into practice involves freeing political action from [...] "unitary and totalizing paranoia" [...] and withdrawing allegiance [...] "from the old categories of the Negative (law, limit, castration, lack, lacuna), which western thought has so long held sacred as a form of power and an access to reality." [...] The psychiatrist David Cooper calls Anti-Oedipus, [...] "a magnificent vision of madness as a revolutionary force", crediting its authors with using [...] "the psychoanalytic language and the discourse of Saussure (and his successors), linguistics against itself in what is already proving to be an historic act of depassment." [...] The critic Frederick Crews writes that when Deleuze and Guattari [...] "indicted Lacanian psychoanalysis as a capitalist disorder" [...] and [...] "pilloried analysts as the most sinister priest-manipulators of a psychotic society" [...] in Anti-Oedipus, their [...] "demonstration was widely regarded as unanswerable" [...] and [...] "devastated the already shrinking Lacanian camp in Paris." ...|$|E
