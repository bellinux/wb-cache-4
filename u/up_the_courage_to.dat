5|$|Everton were {{a declining}} force, and {{finished}} 12th {{in the league}} in 1991–92 whilst exiting both the FA Cup and League Cup at the Fourth Round. They then finished 13th in the 1992–93 season in the newly created Premier League, just four points above the relegation zone. Kendall resigned mid-way through the 1993–94 campaign and was replaced by Mike Walker – Southall later described Walker as a man who loved his suntan more than football. Walker oversaw a run of bad results and Everton only escaped relegation with a final day victory over Wimbledon, winning 3–2 after turning round a 2–0 deficit. Southall saw that his teammates were reluctant to take a penalty in the match and so took the ball himself before Graham Stuart plucked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> take the ball from him and convert the penalty.|$|E

Phil is devastated to find her body, and a letter from her urges him to love himself as others love him. Peggy's funeral takes place on 4 July 2016, and Phil is due to do a eulogy to her there but gets too emotional and runs home.

25|$|After reuniting, {{the party}} finally reaches Alent. Here, Justin meets Liete in person, who reveals {{to him that}} his stone is {{actually}} an ancient artifact forged by the Icarians, a race of powerful sorcerers who lived during the Angelou era, and was {{a gift to the}} humans who lived at the time to use as they pleased to bring prosperity, but when they became corrupted by dark desires, it instead gave birth to Gaia, who nearly destroyed the world. The Icarians sacrificed themselves to save the planet and humanity, and enacted a spell that two of their kind would be born into the world should Gaia ever be revived, destined to also sacrifice themselves to save the world until the next revival in an endless loop. Realizing Feena and Leen are the current revival of the Icarians, Justin sets off to save them from the Gaia-fused Baal, who now faces mutiny among his troops, including his son Mullen. With Gaia proving more than a match for the entire Garlyle army, Leen accepts her destiny and sacrifices herself to lower his defenses. Although Mullen pleads with Feena to finish Gaia, Justin argues that the problem can't be solved with more sacrifice since Gaia will just revive later. Thus Gaia must be defeated outright to end the cycle. Though Gaia defeats the troops and spreads its corruption around the planet, Justin is able to sum <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> face the evil with help from his friends, and travels to the underground heart of Gaia itself to destroy it and the Spirit Stone once and for all. With Gaia defeated permanently, the world experiences a new age of peace. Leen is also restored to life with Gaia's destruction. In an epilogue ten years later, Sue, now a teenager, re-unites with Justin and Feena who arrive home after nearly a decade of adventure, with children in tow.|$|E

500|$|Every November, Vukovar's {{authorities}} hold {{four days}} of festivities to commemorate the town's fall, culminating in a [...] "Procession of Memory" [...] held on 18 November. This represents the expulsion of the town's Croat inhabitants and involves a five-kilometre (3.1 mile) walk from the city's hospital to the Croatian Memorial Cemetery of Homeland War Victims. It is attended by {{tens of thousands of}} people from across Croatia. Local Serbs have avoided participating in the Croatian commemorations, often preferring either to leave the town or stay indoors on 18 November. Until 2003, they held a separate, low-key commemoration at the Serbian military cemetery on 17 November. Such commemorations have been held on 18 November since then. The RSK-era term [...] "Liberation Day" [...] has been dropped, but Serbs also avoid using the Croatian terminology, instead calling it simply [...] "18 November". The issue of how to remember the Serb dead has posed particular difficulties. Local Serbs who died fighting alongside the JNA were buried by the Croatian Serb authorities on a plot of land where Croatian houses had once stood. The gravestones were originally topped with a sculptural evocation of the V-shaped Serbian military cap, or šajkača. After Vukovar's reintegration into Croatia, the gravestones were repeatedly vandalised. The Serb community replaced them with more neutral gravestones without overt military connotations. Vukovar Serbs report feeling marginalised and excluded from places associated with Croatian nationalist sentiment, such as war monuments. The Croatian sociologist Kruno Kardov gives the example of a prominent memorial, a large cross made from white stone, where the Vuka flows into the Danube.

30|$|Starting {{from this}} actual condition, it was {{designed}} a strategy trying to make stations triggers of an urban, territorial and mobility reactivation. In order to reach this goal, it was exploited the innovation power of the cycle tourism, a touristic mobility riding on long and secure paths. Cycle tourism paths are formed by a great cycling network that covers the territory {{of one or more}} regions. It needs some main routes, which should be straight and long-distance, around 100 – 150  km, continuous, possibly paved, and exclusively reserved for bicycles and pedestrians. Given that the long distance routes exceed local ones, and that their use is mainly for tourism, they are defined as cycle tourist backbones. The scheme is simple: their purpose is to establish the structures that can hold together the local and global, and to be recognizable. This kind of extra urban mobility is well known in north European countries, such as Holland, Germany or Austria, where thousands of bikers crowd the paths (AA. VV. 2009, 2012; ADFC 2017). One part of the success of these tourist cycle paths is due to the infrastructure which enables even cycling inexpert <b>to</b> pluck <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> and decide <b>to</b> take a ride. Cycle tourism is not, and should be not be thought as a sporting experience just for someone who is physically prepared, but rather something cultural and enjoyable for everyone. This tourism experience has to be easily accessible since it embeds a cultural project: passing slowly and continuously between different landscapes allows them to become narrative and representative places in movement. This is the reason why it is able to generate a number of important effects, activating an economy spread all over the territory crossed, producing jobs and economic benefits (AA. VV. 2014), and reactivate an unusual way of visiting places, where it is important not just the departure and arrival point, but the path is even more relevant. Basically, tourist cycle paths promote a “light mobility”, having zero environmental impact, and generating multiple positive effects.|$|R
