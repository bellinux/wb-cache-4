5|$|Altar 12 is {{carved in}} the early Maya style and archaeologists {{consider}} {{it to be an}} especially early example dating to {{the first part of the}} Late Preclassic. Because of the carvings on the <b>upper</b> <b>face</b> of the altar, it is supposed that the monument was originally erected as a vertical stela in the Late Preclassic, and was reused as a horizontal altar in the Classic. At this time 16 hieroglyphs were carved around the outer rim of the altar. The carving on the <b>upper</b> <b>face</b> of the altar represents a standing human figure portrayed in profile, facing left. The figure is flanked by two vertical series of four glyphs. A smaller profile figure is depicted facing the first figure, separated from it by one of the series of glyphs. The central figure is depicted standing upon a horizontal band representing the earth, the band is flanked by two earth monsters. Above the figure is a celestial band with part of the head of a sacred bird visible in the centre. The 16 glyphs on the rim of the monument are formed by anthropomorphic figures mixed with other elements.|$|E

25|$|As in {{the case}} of all Soul {{character}}s, Taki's character creation started with her weapon. During the early development of Soul Edge, Taki was conceived as a Yoshimitsu-like ninja character, armed with a long sword and wearing a loose outfit and large helmet covering her <b>upper</b> <b>face.</b> She underwent several major design changes before the game's release, evolving into an athletic, iron-masked, buxom woman with a chest size of 90cm/E (Soulcalibur IV measurements; her breasts have noticeably grew through the series), clad in a partially armored catsuit. Taki used variations of this outfit throughout the series; by default her primary costumes were colored crimson or navy blue. A cloth mask returns with Taki's primary costume in Soulcalibur, which is the only game in which her breasts are partially exposed. Taki has a demon-themed menpo iron mask with her blue-colored main costume in Soulcalibur III and a similar red costume is featured in Legends. Other demonic motifs have appeared on her armor since Soulcalibur.|$|E

500|$|Altar 48 is a {{very early}} example of the Early Maya style of sculpture, dating to {{the first part of}} the Late Preclassic, between 400 and 200 BC. Altar 48 is {{fashioned}} from andesite and measures [...] and is [...] thick. It is located near the southern extreme of Terrace 3, where it is one of a row of 5 monuments running east-west. It is carved on its <b>upper</b> <b>face</b> and upon all four sides. The upper surface bears the intricate design of a crocodile with its body in the form of a symbol representing a cave and containing the figure of a seated Maya wearing a loincloth. The sides of the monument are carved with an early form of Maya hieroglyphs, the text appears to refer directly to the person depicted on the upper surface. Altar 48 had been carefully covered by Stela 14. The emergence of a Maya ruler from the body of the crocodile parallels the myth of the birth of the Maya maize god, who emerges from the shell of a turtle. As such, Altar 48 may be one of the earliest depictions of Maya mythology used for political ends.|$|E

2500|$|Around 50 to 60 {{million years}} ago, during the Paleocene Epoch, Antrim {{was subject to}} intense {{volcanic}} activity, when highly fluid molten basalt intruded through chalk beds to form an extensive lava plateau. As the lava cooled, contraction occurred. Horizontal contraction fractured {{in a similar way}} to drying mud, with the cracks propagating down as the mass cooled, leaving pillarlike structures, which are also fractured horizontally into [...] "biscuits". In many cases the horizontal fracture has resulted in a bottom face that is [...] while the <b>upper</b> <b>face</b> of the lower segment is concave, producing what are called [...] "ball and socket" [...] joints. The size of the columns is primarily determined by the speed at which lava from a volcanic eruption cools. The extensive fracture network produced the distinctive columns seen today. The basalts were originally part of a great volcanic plateau called the Thulean Plateau which formed during the Paleocene.|$|E

[...] Its <b>upper</b> <b>face</b> has a square, bluff look, and its broad muzzle and cheeks are covered by a coarse beard of bristles, like quills. The two white tusks point downward.

The hide of the walrus is nearly an inch thick, and is covered with close, short hair. Beneath the skin he has a thick layer of fat, and this enables him to resist the extreme cold in the midst of which he dwells.|$|E
60|$|As Abijah Wolf had said, the croppers of the West Riding were a rough set. Their {{occupation}} consisted in shearing or cropping {{the wool}} {{on the face}} of cloths. They used a large pair of shears, which were so set that one blade went under the cloth while the other worked on its <b>upper</b> <b>face,</b> mowing the fibers and ends of the wool to a smooth, even surface. The work was hard and required considerable skill, and the men earned about twenty-four shillings a week, a sum which, with bread and all other necessities of life at famine prices, barely sufficed for the support of their families. The introduction of power looms threatened to abolish their calling. It was true that although these machines wove the cloth more evenly and smoothly than the hand looms, croppers were still required to give the necessary smoothness of face; still the tendency had been to lower wages.|$|E
60|$|The body of this walrus was {{not less}} than {{eighteen}} feet long and eleven in circumference. It was more like an elephant in bulk and rotundity than any other creature. It partook very much of {{the form of a}} seal, having two large paw-like flippers, with which, when struggling for life, it had more than once nearly succeeded in getting upon the ice. Its <b>upper</b> <b>face</b> had a square, bluff aspect, and its broad muzzle and cheeks were completely covered by a coarse, quill-like beard of bristles, which gave to it a peculiarly ferocious appearance. The notion that the walrus resembles man is very much overrated. The square, bluff shape of the head already referred to, destroys the resemblance to humanity when distant, and its colossal size does the same when near. Some of the seals deserve this distinction more, their drooping shoulders and oval faces being strikingly like to those of man when at a distance. The white ivory tusks of this creature were carefully measured by Fred, and found to be thirty inches long.|$|E
