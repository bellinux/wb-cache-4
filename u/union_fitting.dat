40|$|A simple {{pressure}} release valve is described: {{it can be made}} locally by the chromatographer and installed in the high-pressure line of a liquid chromatography system to avert accidental overpressure. The device consists mainly of a single-ferrule <b>union</b> <b>fitting</b> with a replaceable aluminum diaphragm designed to release the pressure at a preselected level, e. g., at 3000 psi. To protect the pressure gauge from the sudden release of pressure, the proposed valve is used in conjunction with a ftow-restrictor (pressure "snubber"), which is also described...|$|E
40|$|We {{construct}} a structural macroeconometric model for member {{states of the}} West African Economic and Monetary <b>Union.</b> <b>Fitting</b> this model to annual and quarterly time series data allows us to identify the channels through which macroeconomic innovation in one country impact on {{other countries in the}} union. We also discover the extent of heterogeneity across the member states in terms of the degree of similarity of macroeconomic transmission mechanisms. This is one important element in measuring the costs of union membership for each country...|$|E
40|$|The {{implementation}} of the unsteady leak rate simulation by the Method of Characteristics is discussed, and the respective numerical equations are derived. The use of the steady-state orifice equation for the computation of unsteady leak rates from pipe through-crack or rupture is discussed and evaluated. Five different shapes of artificially made pipe through-cracks were experimentally considered. These types of leak sources include a circumferential crack, a loose weldment crack, multiple small cracks, a longitudinal long crack and a loose <b>union</b> <b>fitting.</b> Different values of steady-state leak rates were run through each of these crack types and a leak opening dimensional coefficient analogous {{to that of the}} orifice was established. Severe transient flow through the same leak opening was then run, and the average steady-state value for this Coefficient was used to establish a leak rate history throughout the transient course. A comparison between this leak rate history and the corresponding measured rate was considered, and {{it was found that the}} use of the steady-state orifice equation for the computation of leak rate from pipe through-crack (rupture) during transient flow conditions was accurate for normal-sized leaks...|$|E
50|$|If {{frequent}} disconnection will be required, gasketed {{pipe flanges}} or <b>union</b> <b>fittings</b> provide better reliability than threads. Some thin-walled pipes of ductile material, {{such as the}} smaller copper or flexible plastic water pipes found in homes for ice makers and humidifiers, for example, may be joined with compression fittings.|$|R
50|$|Joints to {{fittings}} {{are made}} with slip-on solvent-welded connections, which set up rapidly after assembly and attain full strength in about one day. Since slip-fit sections {{do not need to}} be rotated during assembly, the special <b>union</b> <b>fittings</b> used with threaded conduit (such as Ericson) are not required. Since PVC conduit has a higher coefficient of thermal expansion than other types, it must be mounted to allow for expansion and contraction of each run. Care should be taken when installing PVC underground in multiple or parallel run configurations due to mutual heating effect of densely packed cables, because the conduit will deform when heated.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—As a {{generalization}} of the subspace <b>fitting,</b> the <b>union</b> of subspaces <b>fitting</b> problem consists in finding an union of subspaces in some given family that best fits to the finite data. This report provides a detailed {{review of the}} main reference [4] {{about the existence of}} such optimal solution. Proofs for a series of unproved statements in the reference are given. A basic background in topology and functional analysis in connection with the problem is also included to explain the ideas of the paper. Applications to specific problems are discussed to illustrate the tools in the paper. Index Terms—subspace fitting, principal component analysis, generalized principal component analysis, data modeling, data clustering, union of subspaces, hybrid linear, mixed model, heterogeneous mode...|$|R
60|$|They {{moved forward}} {{a little faster}} {{to see what the}} dog was barking at, and found perched upon a point of rock by the {{roadside}} a curious creature. It had the form of a man, middle-sized and rather slender and graceful; but as it sat silent and motionless upon the peak they could see that its face was black as ink, and it wore a black cloth costume made like a <b>union</b> suit and <b>fitting</b> tight to its skin. Its hands were black, too, and its toes curled down, like a bird's. The creature was black all over except its hair, which was fine, and yellow, banged in front across the black forehead and cut close at the sides. The eyes, which were fixed steadily upon the barking dog, were small and sparkling and looked like the eyes of a weasel.|$|R
5000|$|Clayton Mark founded Clayton Mark and Company in 1900 in Evanston to {{manufacture}} wrought steel pipe and water well supplies. Clayton Mark, {{along with his}} four sons Clarence Mark, Clayton Mark, Cyrus Mark, and Griffith Mark held various positions in the firm {{and made it a}} driver of Evanston’s economy. It was the single largest employer in the city, with overall sales exceeding $10,000,000 a year. Clayton Mark products were sold throughout the United States and many countries worldwide. For example, Mark’s forged steel <b>unions</b> (high pressure <b>fittings)</b> were used in oil wells from Texas to Arabia. The steel tubing manufactured at Clayton Mark and Company was used in the making of furniture, automobiles, and bicycles whose market was worldwide. Mark conduit was used in house construction for the conduction of electrical wiring. [...] The firm's water well systems, supplies, and devices were used for pumping water out of the ground in rural districts around the globe.|$|R
50|$|Quick connect {{fittings}} (push fittings) {{are used}} {{in a wide variety}} of plumbing, heating, electrical and fire suppression systems. Quick Fitting, Inc., Warwick Rhode Island has been a prolific inventor of innovations in quick connect technologies. Quick Fitting is the original inventor of quick connect for electrical, fire suppression and plumbing technologies, holding over 20 U.S. and foreign patents on quick connection technology. U.S. Patent & Trademark Office Quick connect works by inserting the tubing into a connection mechanism that deploys fastening teeth onto the tubing surface. When opposing force is applied to the union, the teeth are forced deeper into the tubing, preventing separation of the <b>union.</b> Quick connect <b>fittings</b> offer a significant time saving benefit over traditional technologies and require little skill for their usage. There are a large variety of quick connect fittings in the market and they are found in all industries. They are employed many kilometers underwater, in drilling operations, in orbit, for docking spacecraft, and everywhere in between, for a myriad of reasons.|$|R
