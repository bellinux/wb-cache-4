40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} {{a method of}} computing minimal models in circumscription using integer programming in propositional logic and first-order logic with domain closure <b>axioms</b> and <b>unique</b> <b>name</b> <b>axioms.</b> This kind of treatment is very important since this enable to apply various technique developed in operations research to nonmonotonic reasoning. (Nerode et al., 1995) {{are the first to}} propose a method of computing circumscription using integer programming. They claimed their method was correct for circumscription with fixed predicate, but we show that their method does not correctly reflect their claim. We show a correct method of computing all the minimal models not only with fixed predicates but also with varied predicates and we extend our method to compute prioritized circumscription as well...|$|R
40|$|Consistency-based {{approaches}} in nonmonotonic reasoning {{may be expected}} to yield multiple sets of default conclusions for a given default theory. Reasoning about such extensions is carried out at the meta-level. In this paper, we show how such reasoning may be carried out at the object level for a large class of default theories. Essentially we show how one can translate a (semi-monotonic) default theory #, obtaining a second # #, such that # # has a single extension that encodes every extension of #. Moreover, our translated theory is only a constant factor larger than the original (with the exception of <b>unique</b> <b>names</b> <b>axioms).</b> We prove that our translation behaves correctly. In the approach we can now encode the notion of extension from within the framework of standard default logic. Hence one can encode notions such as skeptical and credulous conclusions, and can reason about such conclusions within a single extension. This result has some theoretical interest, in that it shows how multiple extensions of semi-monotonic default theories are encodable with manageable overhead in a single extension. default logic, skeptical reasoning, credulous reasoning, tagging...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{evaluate}} HERMIT, an OWL 2 reasoner, {{on a set}} of {{test cases}} that emerge from an unusual but very practical way of using Description Logics (DLs). In the field of reasoning about actions, the projection problem is an elemental problem that deals with answering whether a certain formula holds after doing a sequence of actions starting from some initial states represented using an incomplete theory. We consider a fragment of the situation calculus and Reiter’s basic action theories (BAT) such that the projection problem can be reduced to the satisfiability problem in an expressive description logic ALCO U. We adapt an approach called regression where an input query is equivalently transformed until it can be directly checked against the initial theory supplemented with the <b>unique</b> <b>name</b> <b>axioms</b> (UNA) without any consideration {{to the rest of the}} BAT. To study regression in practice, we implemented it in C++, defined an XML SCHEMA to describe a BAT and queries, created 7 domains some of which are inspired from well-known planning competition domains, and invented generators that can create random but meaningful instances of the projection problem. The formula resulting from regressing a projection query, together with the initial theory and UNA, is fed to an OWL 2 reasoner to answer whether the regressed query holds given the initial theory and UNA. We measure the input formula using a number of metrics, such as a number of U-role occurrences and a number of individuals, and evaluate the performance of HERMIT on formulas along each dimension...|$|R
