[...] The show is also a way to [...] "introduce Pee-wee to the new generation that didn't know about it", preparing the way for Reubens' main project, the Playhouse movie. Before this comeback, Reubens' present age and shape had been pointed out as a possible issue, since Pee-wee's slim figure and clean skin {{have been one of}} his trademarks. But after appearing {{for the first time since}} 1992 as Pee-wee at Spike TV's 2007 Guys' Choice Awards, Reubens had remained optimistic and had jokingly said he's no longer nervous about being young Pee-wee again thanks to digital retouching.|$|E

Batmanglij announced the track's existence via Twitter on April 29, 2015. The song has been noted for its experimental vocal effects, with Batmanglij scattering distorted vocal cuts throughout, a [...] "creepy" [...] quality that the pair immediately liked. Elsewhere, sections of [...] "Warm Blood" [...] were sung in a lower pitch: [...] "I had shown <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> my voice was a little shot. The idea was that I would come back and sing it 'properly' once I’d recovered, but we ended up getting married to how it sounded since my voice was kind of smokier, so we kept it."

Roberts explained the concept of the track, noting [...] "What it is with Sticks + Stones is I wanted all the people out there who hurt like that to know that they’re not the only ones in that position. Sometimes there's so many people in the world suffering from the same thing or hurting from the same thing, but they feel like they’re on their own. I wanted a song that could highlight the subject so it was like, actually I’m so not on my own here."

He had at once retired from active business and invested his millions in ways that would cause him the least annoyance; but the income on so large a sum was more than he could take care of, and even Major Doyle, who managed these affairs for his brother-in-law, was often puzzled {{to know what to do}} with the money that accumulated.|$|E

I snatched his big spear from his hand, broke it over his head and gave him the best hiding with its shaft that he had ever heard of. Then I kicked him off the place. He limped away but when he was out of reach, turned and called out that one day he would come again with others and take her, meaning Inez, without leaving the price in ivory and gold.
