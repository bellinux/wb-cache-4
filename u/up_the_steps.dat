5|$|The {{very last}} {{act of the}} American Civil War was when Captain Waddell walked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> of the town hall in November 1865 with a letter {{to present to the}} mayor {{surrendering}} his vessel, the CSS Shenandoah, to the British government.|$|E
5|$|Curious, the {{researchers}} explore {{the room and}} {{hear the sounds of}} a woman running followed by a gut-wrenching scream. Jill Greeley (Jane Asher), an emotionally sensitive computer programmer, has a vision of a woman running <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> in the room and falling, apparently to her death.|$|E
5|$|It is {{alarming}} {{and also}} nauseating to see Mr Gandhi, a seditious Middle Temple lawyer, now {{posing as a}} fakir of a type {{well known in the}} East, striding half-naked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> of the Vice-regal palace....to parley on equal terms with the representative of the King-Emperor.|$|E
60|$|He leaped <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>step</b> {{and was in}} the room. Her mother {{appeared}} in the inner doorway, large and hostile.|$|R
6000|$|Lastly, as if {{he could}} not help it, Guy dashed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>step</b> once more, pressed Charles's hand, and said, 'God bless you, Charlie!' ...|$|R
60|$|They went <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stepped</b> {{platforms}} to <b>the</b> swiftest one, {{and there}} Asano accosted a labourer. The answers to his questions {{were in the}} thick, vulgar speech.|$|R
5|$|The girl, near death, {{is being}} ministered to by paramedics, fantasizing and being 'sexually aroused {{by a large}} python and writhing on a bed that lit up {{in time with the}} music, while {{surrounded}} by a group of bemused, semi-naked dancers'. When Steinman's manager saw it, he responded 'It's a porno movie!' The two-day shoot ran over schedule and budget, costing £35,000 an hour. Russell and Steinman even designed a sequence where a motorcyclist would cycle <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> of a local church-tower, jump out of the turrets at the top, and then explode; alas, the wardens of the church refused permission.|$|E
5|$|Sometime later, Bud confronts Gekko in Central Park. Gekko {{physically}} assaults Bud as he berates him for {{his role}} with Bluestar and accuses him of ingratitude for several of their illicit trades. Following the confrontation, it is revealed that Bud has turned state's evidence and was wearing a wire to record his encounter with Gekko. He turns the wire tapes over to the authorities, who suggest that he may get a lighter sentence in exchange for helping them make a case against Gekko. Later on, Bud's parents drive him down FDR Drive towards the New York State Supreme Court Building downtown to answer for the crimes he committed under Gekko's influence. Carl tells him he did right in saving the airline. The film ends with Bud going <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> of the courthouse, knowing that while he is likely going to prison and his career is ruined, he now has a clear conscience.|$|E
25|$|When walking <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> to The Gap at Watsons Bay, {{there is}} flat ground in between {{two sets of}} steps. This {{continues}} for a fair way in both directions, and is the old tram right of way.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{shall not}} get home without a wetting, unless we take shelter under this {{convenient}} loggia," [...] Tito said, hastily, hurrying Romola, {{with a slightly}} startled movement, <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>step</b> of <b>the</b> loggia.|$|R
60|$|Louisa came grimly over <b>the</b> field, <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{verandah}} <b>steps,</b> {{and into}} <b>the</b> room without knocking.|$|R
50|$|Disc 1 {{and part}} of disc 2 are the {{sessions}} that made <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Seven <b>Steps</b> to Heaven album.|$|R
25|$|Some of {{the most}} memorable moments in the 1976 boxing-themed feature film, Rocky—such as Rocky's carcass-punching scenes and Rocky running <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, as part of his {{training}} regimen—are taken from Frazier's real-life exploits. In the film, Frazier makes a cameo appearance, promoting the fight between Rocky and Apollo.|$|E
25|$|The Gates of Doom pulsate {{with green}} mist as Indiana Jones struggles {{to keep the}} doors closed. Jones, {{speaking}} in Japanese, scolds the tourists for looking {{into the eyes of}} the Crystal Skull and instructs them to proceed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> to the left. The triumphant musical theme from Raiders of the Lost Ark is heard as the transport accelerates up the flight of stairs.|$|E
25|$|CSS Shenandoah {{had struck}} her colors twice. This marked the last {{surrender}} of the American Civil War {{and the last}} official lowering of the Confederate flag. The very last act of the Civil War was Captain Waddell walking <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> of Liverpool Town Hall with a letter {{to present to the}} mayor surrendering his vessel to the British government. In so doing, the Shenandoah became the only Confederate warship to circumnavigate the globe.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: An {{honor guard}} {{carrying}} the coffin of William McKinley <b>up</b> <b>the</b> east <b>steps</b> of <b>the</b> United States Capitol, 1901.|$|R
60|$|The next {{instant the}} Trutz-Drachen men were thundering at the door, but Schwartz Carl was already far <b>up</b> <b>the</b> winding <b>steps.</b>|$|R
60|$|Dorothy {{left her}} {{and walked slowly}} toward the place, where she met the Tin Woodman just going <b>up</b> <b>the</b> front <b>steps.</b>|$|R
25|$|At 1:15p.m., {{the prisoners}} were taken through the {{courtyard}} and <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> of the gallows. Each prisoner's ankles and wrists were manacled. More than 1,000 people—including government officials, members of the U.S. armed forces, friends and family of the condemned, official witnesses, and reporters—watched from the Arsenal courtyard and the tops of its walls. Alexander Gardner, who had photographed Powell and the others two months before, photographed the execution for the government.|$|E
25|$|Afridi {{was charged}} on 8 February 2007 of {{bringing}} the game into disrepute after he was seen on camera thrusting his bat at a spectator who swore at {{him on his way}} <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> after being dismissed. Afridi was given a four-game ODI suspension, the minimum possible ban for such an offence, meaning that he would miss Pakistan's first two 2007 World Cup matches. The PCB and Afridi chose not to appeal the ban, despite feeling that the punishment was excessively harsh.|$|E
25|$|The {{transport}} momentarily {{appears to}} head toward an exit, {{before making a}} sharp turn into a large crumbling corridor. Lightning flashes along the walls, illuminating large cobra statues overhead as the transport continues forward. The Gates of Doom pulsate with green mist and an audio-animatronic Indiana Jones struggles to keep the doors closed. Jones scolds the tourists for looking into the idol's eyes and instructs them to proceed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> to the left. The transport then accelerates up the flight of stairs.|$|E
60|$|They {{came to the}} landing-stage. Wet and naked-looking, Gerald climbed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> few <b>steps.</b> There stood his father, in the night.|$|R
60|$|It was {{ten o'clock}} when Eliphalet reached Miss Crane's, and picked his way <b>up</b> <b>the</b> front <b>steps</b> where <b>the</b> {{boarders}} were gathered.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will," [...] {{returned}} his Majesty. Unopposed {{they reached the}} royal palace and marched <b>up</b> <b>the</b> marble <b>steps,</b> which had once been ...|$|R
25|$|After the screening, the {{two couples}} stayed outside the theatre {{for a while}} but {{separated}} about 23:15. Olof and Lisbet Palme headed south {{on the west side}} of Sveavägen, towards the northern entrance of the Hötorget metro station. When they reached the Adolf Fredrik Church, they crossed Sveavägen and continued on the street's east side. They stopped a moment to look at something in a shop window, continued past the Dekorima shop which was then located on the corner of Sveavägen and Tunnelgatan, and headed for the metro station entrance on the other side of Tunnelgatan. At 23:21, halfway across the street and only a few metres from the station entrance, a man appeared from behind, shot Mr. Palme at point-blank range and fired a second shot at Mrs. Palme. The perpetrator then jogged down Tunnelgatan street, <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> to Malmskillnadsgatan and continued down David Bagares gata , where he was last seen.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after his}} trip to the moon, Armstrong visited the Old City of Jerusalem. Walking <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> to the Hulda Gates, when {{informed}} of the religious belief that Jesus had walked the same steps many times, he remarked to his Israeli archaeologist guide, [...] "I am more exctied stepping on these stones than I was stepping on the moon." ...|$|E
500|$|The caisson {{stopped when}} it arrived at Capitol Hill; {{military}} units removed it, and [...] "Hail to the Chief" [...] was played amidst a 21-gun salute. The casket was carried up the west {{front steps of}} the Capitol, mainly because Reagan was first inaugurated there {{and he wanted to}} face west, toward California. Two teams of military pallbearers carried the casket <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> of the Capitol to [...] "The Battle Hymn of the Republic".|$|E
60|$|With a {{crack of}} his whip Mr. Sanderson whirled {{from the road}} into the grounds and drove <b>up</b> to <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> of <b>the</b> main building.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Mr. Montague Dartie, Poste Restante, Buenos Aires.' I should hurry <b>up</b> with <b>the</b> <b>steps,</b> if I were you. He fairly fed me up last night." ...|$|R
60|$|However, {{there is}} no need to tell how many cross and quarrelsome things the two tired friends said to each other. They were sitting on {{opposite}} sides of the fire, one very gloomy, and the other very pettish, when the waggonette stopped at the gate, to put out Miss Hacket and take up Dolores. Hands pulled her <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>step,</b> and a hubbub of merry voices received her in the dark.|$|R
500|$|Finally given {{knowledge}} {{of what happened to}} him and why, in a calmer place, Jacob returns to his family's home. He sorts through his mementos, including his combat dog tags and honorable discharge. He is stunned to find Gabe {{at the foot of the}} stairwell who takes him by the hand and leads him <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> into a bright light that engulfs the screen. [...] In a wartime triage tent in 1971, military doctors fruitlessly treating Jacob reluctantly declare him dead after “putting up a Hell of a fight” and remark on the peaceful expression that has settled upon his face.|$|E
500|$|No further {{goals were}} scored, and the referee blew for full {{time with the}} final score 3–1 to Manchester City. As the players left the field, the crowd sang a chorus of [...] "For he's a jolly good fellow" [...] in tribute to Trautmann's bravery. Roy Paul led his team <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> to the royal box to receive Manchester City's third FA Cup. Trautmann's neck {{continued}} to cause him pain, and the Duke of Edinburgh commented on its crooked state as he gave Trautmann his winner's medal. Three days later, an examination revealed that Trautmann had broken a bone in his neck.|$|E
500|$|The Band Wagon, which {{featured}} {{the music and}} lyrics of Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz, included an extensive dance sequence at the end, the [...] "Girl Hunt Ballet" [...] featuring Astaire and Charisse, which was a spoof of hard-boiled Mickey Spillane novels. Kidd was hired to stage the film's dances at Astaire's request, because he was nervous about the ballet. Kidd said that he made Astaire comfortable by pretending {{that he was just}} making <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> spontaneously. The film also featured [...] "Shine on Your Shoes", set in a 42nd Street penny arcade and featuring Astaire and LeRoy Daniels, a real-life shoe-shiner, and [...] "Dancing in the Dark" [...] with Charisse, set in Central Park.|$|E
60|$|Eunice did not pause. She went boldly through <b>the</b> {{yard and}} <b>up</b> <b>the</b> porch <b>steps.</b> He retreated before her {{and held the}} door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Little gipsy! I'll settle her," [...] muttered the old man, bustling <b>up</b> to <b>the</b> <b>steps,</b> and ringing <b>the</b> bell, as if {{the house}} was on fire.|$|R
50|$|In {{common with}} many other villages close to the scarp of the Chiltern Hills, the parishes formed from the ancient manors and estates ran from the fertile Vale of Aylesbury <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>step</b> wooded slope onto the Chiltern plateau and dip slope. They are collectively known by the social {{geographic}} term of strip parishes. Over time the upland communities, which had originally been temporary outposts connected to summer agricultural activity (transhumance), became distinct, permanent settlements.|$|R
