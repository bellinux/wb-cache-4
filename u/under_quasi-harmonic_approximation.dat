40|$|Using density {{functional}} theory (DFT) calculations, we have systematically {{investigated the}} thermodynamic properties and structural stabilities of thorium dioxide (ThO$_ 2 $). Based on the calculated phonon dispersion curves, we calculate the thermal expansion coefficient, bulk modulus, and heat capacities at different temperatures for ThO$_ 2 $ <b>under</b> the <b>quasi-harmonic</b> <b>approximation.</b> All {{the results are}} in good agreement with corresponding experiments proving the validity of our methods. Our theoretical studies can help people more clearly understand the thermodynamic behaviors of ThO$_ 2 $ at different temperatures. In addition, we have also studied possible defect formations and diffusion behaviors of helium in ThO$_ 2 $, to discuss its structural stability. It is found that in intrinsic ThO$_ 2 $ without any Fermi energy shifts, the interstitial Th$_i^{ 4 +}$ defect other than oxygen or thorium vacancies, interstitial oxygen, and any kinds of Frenkel pairs, is most probable to form with an energy release of 1. 74 eV. However, after upshifting the Fermi energy, {{the formation of the}} other defects also becomes possible. For helium diffusion, we find that only through the thorium vacancy can it happen with the small energy barrier of 0. 52 eV. Otherwise, helium atoms can hardly incorporate or diffuse in ThO$_ 2 $. Our results indicate that people should prevent upshifts of the Fermi energy of ThO$_ 2 $ to avoid the formation of thorium vacancies and so as to prevent helium caused damages.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a computational method for seamlessly bridging the atomistic and the continuum realms at finite temperature. The theoretical formulation {{is based on}} the static theory of the quasicontinuum and extends it to model non-equilibrium finite temperature material response. At non-zero temperature, the problem of coarse-graining is compounded by the presence of multiple time scales in addition to multiple spatial scales. We address this problem by first averaging over the thermal motion of atoms to obtain an effective temperature-dependent energy on the macroscopic scale. Two methods are proposed to this end. The first method is developed as a variational mean field approximation which yields local thermodynamic potentials such as the internal energy, the free energy, and the entropy as phase averages of appropriate phase functions. The chief advantage of this theory is that it accounts for the anharmonicity of the interaction potentials, albeit numerically, unlike many methods based on statistical mechanics which require the <b>quasi-harmonic</b> <b>approximation</b> for computational feasibility. Furthermore, the theory reduces to the classical canonical ensemble approach of Gibbs <b>under</b> the <b>quasi-harmonic</b> <b>approximation</b> for perfect, isotropic, infinite crystals subjected to uniform temperature. In the second method, based on perturbation analysis, the internal energy is derived as an effective Hamiltonian of the atomistic system by treating the thermal fluctuations as perturbations about an equilibrium configuration. These energy functionals are then introduced into the quasicontinuum theory, which facilitates spatial coarse-graining of the atomistic description. Finally, a variational formulation for simulating rate problems, such as heat conduction, using the quasicontinuum method is developed. This is achieved by constructing a joint incremental energy functional whose Euler-Lagrange equations yield the equilibrium equations as well as the time-discretized heat equation. We conclude by presenting the results for numerical validation tests for the thermal expansion coefficient and the specific heat for some materials and compare them with classical theory, molecular dynamics results, and experimental data. Some illustrative examples of thermo-mechanical coupled problems such as heat conduction in a deformable solid, adiabatic tension test, and finite temperature nanoindentation are also presented which show qualitative agreement with expected behavior and demonstrate the applicability of the method...|$|R

Background. This work {{is related}} to the {{theoretical}} calculation of the vacancy formation energy in the context of finding an answer to two unsolved questions. Firstly, there is no single {{answer to the question of}} calculations accuracy of the vacancy formation energy. Secondly, the existing phenomenological theories tacitly assume that the vacancy formation energy and entropy of vacancy formation do not depend on temperature. Objective. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of temperature factor on the free energy of vacancy formation and its components in a number of metals within the <b>quasi-harmonic</b> <b>approximation.</b> Methods. The vacancy formation energy and entropy in FCC Al, Ag, and Pd are determined as a function of temperature using ab initio methods within a <b>quasi-harmonic</b> <b>approximation.</b> Results. It was shown, that the vacancy formation energy substantially increases with temperature in all cases, which {{is related to}} the thermal lattice expansion. Such increase of the vacancy formation energy is compensated by the vibrational vacancy formation entropy contribution. The latter appears to be strongly increasing with temperature in the case of Mo. Conclusions. However, a thermodynamic analysis shows that such increase of vacancy formation energy in the process of calculation is largely underestimated. The latter is compensated by contribution from vibrating entropy of vacancy formation and strongly increases with temperature.
