5|$|FES {{was sold}} and then {{withdrawn}} in the UK in 1976 as Guinness XXX Extra Strong Stout; it returned in 1990 when interest in craft beer increased. The beer was again {{withdrawn from the}} UK market, returning in 2003 to cater for the increasing African diaspora. The British market is supplied with both the Irish and the Nigerian brewed variants of the beer, the latter of which has annual sales of £2 million. Official imports of FES into the <b>US</b> <b>were</b> resumed in 2010, following a resurgent interest in craft beer; this was {{after a period of}} grey imports, predominantly for African and Caribbean expatriates.|$|E

5|$|Galveston's {{attitudes toward}} race were at times {{unique in the}} region. The strict segregationalist attitudes {{prevalent}} {{in many parts of}} the <b>U.S.</b> <b>were</b> not always as stark in Galveston's society as in some other parts of Texas. One of the most striking examples of this was the gradual establishment of biracial labor unions of waterfront workers beginning in the 19th century, although eventually this alliance fell victim to segregationist influence. Racist ideology was always an ever-present factor in the city, however, as evinced by the name of the group which ran the Mardi Gras, the Kotton Karnival Kids (KKK, the same initials as the Ku Klux Klan).|$|E
5|$|Governments {{such as the}} Netherlands and New Zealand {{have responded}} to the public's {{concerns}} by outlawing invasive experiments on certain classes of non-human primates, particularly the great apes. In 2015, captive chimpanzees in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>were</b> added to the Endangered Species Act adding new road blocks to those wishing to experiment on them. Similarly, citing ethical considerations and the availability of alternative research methods, the U.S. NIH announced in 2013 that it would dramatically reduce and eventually phase out experiments on chimpanzees.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the true}} {{second wave of}} {{immigration}} did not begin until the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 abolished national origins quotas. After the passage of that act, Armenians from the Soviet Union, Turkey, Lebanon, Iran and other Middle Eastern countries began migrating in large numbers, many fleeing political instability in their host countries. In the 1950s, most Armenian immigrants in the <b>US</b> <b>were</b> from Soviet Armenia and Turkey. The Istanbul pogrom in 1955 frightened the local Turkish Armenian population, which looked to the West for a safe and more prosperous life.|$|E

Early in his presidency, Marcos initiated numerous infrastructure projects but was accused of massive corruption and embezzling {{billions of dollars in}} public funds. Nearing the end of his term, Marcos declared Martial Law on September 21, 1972. This period of his rule was characterized by political repression, censorship, and human rights violations but the <b>US</b> <b>were</b> steadfast in their support.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{the medical}} costs {{attributable}} to obesity in the <b>US</b> <b>were</b> an estimated $190.2billion or 20.6% of all medical expenditures, while {{the cost of}} obesity in Canada was estimated at CA$2 billion in 1997 (2.4% of total health costs). The total annual direct cost of overweight and obesity in Australia in 2005 was A$21 billion. Overweight and obese Australians also received A$35.6 billion in government subsidies. The estimate range for annual expenditures on diet products is $40billion to $100billion in the US alone.|$|E
5|$|Mainstream press {{reviews in}} the <b>US</b> <b>were</b> mixed and were largely {{negative}} in the UK, although a review in Asia was more positive.

In 1988, 141 whales caught on the east coast of the <b>U.S.</b> <b>were</b> taken by the foreign Atlantic mackerel fishery, which forced it to be shut down.|$|E

5|$|When the {{war started}} Seward turned his {{attention}} to making sure that foreign powers did not interfere in the conflict. When in April 1861, the Confederacy announced that it would authorize privateers, Seward sent word to the American representatives abroad that the U.S. would become party to the Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law of 1856, outlawing such vessels, but Britain required that, if the <b>U.S.</b> <b>were</b> to become a party, the ratification would not require action to be taken against Confederate vessels.|$|E
5|$|With orchestral {{standards}} now {{of unprecedented}} excellence, eminent musicians from Europe and the <b>U.S.</b> <b>were</b> eager {{to perform at}} the Queen's Hall. Among the guest conductors at the hall in the 1930s were Serge Koussevitzky, Willem Mengelberg, Arturo Toscanini, Bruno Walter and Felix Weingartner. Composer-conductors included Richard Strauss and Anton Webern. Some recordings made in the hall during this period have been reissued on CD.|$|E
5|$|Business tycoon Louis Benjamin was {{involved}} with Lew Grade as {{part of one of}} the four major record companies in the UK at the time. The company was Pye Records which, along with EMI, Philips, and Decca Records (UK), accounted {{for the vast majority of}} music records sold in the UK. In 1959, ATV acquired 50% of Pye Records. Between them, Grade and Benjamin held most of the shares. ATV Music Publishing was created to exploit the catalogue of songs written by artists on the Pye Record label, and for the themes to ITC and ATV television programmes. The UK rights to some of the rock 'n' roll music from the <b>US</b> <b>were</b> also bought by ATV. Grade established ATV's headquarters alongside those of Pye Records; off Edgware Road, beside the Marble Arch in central London.|$|E

5|$|By 1913, Large Black had by {{then spread}} {{throughout}} most of Britain, and had been exported to most of mainland Europe and to North and South America, Africa and Oceania. The first exports to Australia were in 1902 or 1903, with the Large Black being chosen over the Berkshire pig because {{of their ability to}} thrive in hot weather, their foraging abilities and their fecundity. By 1930, Large Blacks represented only 1 percent of Australia pig population, and were raised mainly by breeders in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. The breed population continued to hover around 1 percent of the total population, with a slight increase after World War II and a decrease to almost zero new registrations in the 1980s. The first exports to the <b>US</b> <b>were</b> in the 1920s, but the population in that country dwindled to the point where imports were again necessary in 1985. Today, small herds {{can be found in the}} US that descend from the pigs imported in 1985 and 1990, and there are also herds in Canada, Australia, and South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{intensely}} closeted {{nature of}} Miami's gay community at that time, many voters {{who were not}} swayed by Bryant's rhetoric were persuaded instead by her campaign's point that the law was unnecessary; {{they were unable to}} see the problem of discrimination. Unlike blacks or Cubans, gay men and lesbians were able to find jobs, although they faced dismissal upon their supervisors learning of their sexual orientation. In order to see a complaint through, they would have to remain out, and many lived in constant fear of exposure. Since the advent of second wave feminism earlier in the decade, many lesbians in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>were</b> unable to see themselves as part of the same community with gay men. Accusations from Save Our Children were almost all directed at the behavior of men. As a result, much of the response by gay men was angry and many lesbians took issue with the misogynistic tone gay men used. However, with Bryant representing a common adversary, {{for the first time in}} years, gay men and lesbians united to work together on the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at the UN, {{although}} the UN members and <b>US</b> <b>were</b> initially divided {{on how to}} respond to Chinese intervention in Korea, the Chinese rejection of UN ceasefire soon rallied the UN members towards US. Immediately afterward, a UN resolution that condemned China as an aggressor was passed on February 1. In the opinion of historian Bevin Alexander, the Chinese rejection of UN ceasefire had damaged the international prestige it had built from its earlier military successes, and this later made it difficult for China to either join the UN or to deny US support for Taiwan. The Korean War, which ultimately ended at the 38th parallel, would drag on for another two bloody years due to the Chinese demand for all UN forces to be withdrawn from the Korean Peninsula.|$|E
