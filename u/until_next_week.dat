5000|$|Kevin Fitzpatrick at Screen Crush felt [...] "it was {{important}} that the series stick the landing on the final two episodes of season 2’s front half, and while we expect the story threads to pay off more handsomely next week, “Ye Who Enter Here” ended up feeling a little lighter for it ...

He was pleased that Fitz and Simmons talked about their feelings, but said [...] "it seems almost as though “Ye Who Enter Here” wasn’t quite {{ready to deal with}} any actual ramifications of the feelings gap between the pair". He ultimately said [...] "Memorable moments like Koenig’s umbrella cloak or Skye’s extended fight with Agent 33 offer acceptable substitute for whatever cards the showrunners hold back <b>until</b> <b>next</b> <b>week,</b> and Ward’s latest betrayal offered some intriguing wrinkles in hour that boiled down to little more than “get to hidden city, or at least tease cryptically.”" [...] James Hunt, writing for Den of Geek, stated [...] "the series finally feels like it has some direction, rather than just momentum", and was pleased with Ward's actions {{at the end of the}} episode, saying [...] "This episode did do one thing I didn't expect, though, and that's make Ward seem like a believable villain. The scene where he entered the plane worked because he had the power, and they respected it." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called the episode [...] "another solid, engaging installment, and a good set-up for whatever's coming next week." [...] "Even with all the characters and bits of business to deal with, the episode never felt overcrowded or rushed, and was able to focus on the character element that's made season 2 such a huge improvement over season 1."
