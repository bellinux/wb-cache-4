5|$|Gaseous {{diffusion}} {{had been}} used to separate isotopes before. Francis William Aston had <b>used</b> <b>it</b> to partially separate isotopes of neon in 1931, and Gustav Ludwig Hertz had improved on the method to almost completely separate neon by running it through a series of stages. In the United States, William D. Harkins had <b>used</b> <b>it</b> to separate chlorine. Kistiakowsky was familiar with the work of Charles G. Maier at the Bureau of Mines, who had used the process to separate gases.|$|E
5|$|In general, Geographia Neoteriki, {{was welcomed}} with enthusiasm by western {{intellectual}} circles. Jean-Baptiste d'Ansse de Villoison, professor of modern Greek in the Ecole des Langues Orientales Vivantes, <b>used</b> <b>it</b> as a textbook for his students. French geographer Barbie du Bocage published a review after the book's publication along with a translated passage. Moreover, travellers who published accounts during the early 19th century, frequently cited the text. François Pouqueville, William Martin Leake, Henry Holland, and Lord Byron mentioned this work, and <b>used</b> <b>it</b> {{as a source of}} information. The book also enjoyed some popularity in the non Greek regions of the Balkan peninsula, while 19th century Bulgarian authors of geographic textbooks <b>used</b> <b>it</b> as a model.|$|E

Savielly Tartakower <b>used</b> <b>it</b> four times in 1928 when he was the eighth-best player in the world, {{including}} thrice in one tournament (Bad Kissingen 1928) but he scored only ½ point against world-class opposition: Bogoljubov then ranked number four in the world, Capablanca ranked number two, and Rubinstein ranked number seven. Rudolf Spielmann <b>used</b> <b>it</b> thrice in 1922–23 when he was about number 9–12 in the world, with a win against Euwe but defeats against Yates and Sämisch. Nigel Short played the gambit twice in the years 1992–93 when he was number7–11, scoring only ½ points against Karpov (then ranked number two) and Ivanchuk (then ranked number three).

5|$|A {{multi-purpose}} breed, the Norman Cob {{was formerly}} used wherever {{there was a}} need. It was utilized {{in a variety of}} agricultural and other work by farmers, and was used by the army for pulling artillery.

Postal workers appreciated the breed for its willingness to remain calm, stationary and tethered for long periods of time.

5|$|Although {{most of the}} defences were {{in place}} by the time of Ranulph's death in 1232, there were no living quarters, and neither were there on the death of Ranulph's {{successor}} John in 1237.

Henry enlarged Beeston Castle during his wars with Wales, and <b>used</b> <b>it</b> as a prison for his Welsh captives. No attempt was made to equip the castle as a permanent residence with halls and chambers; garrisons were probably housed in wooden structures within the outer bailey.|$|E
