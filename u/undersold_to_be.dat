Duchovny claimed that Fox had <b>undersold</b> the rights <b>to</b> its own affiliates, thereby costing him huge sums of money. Originally, in the contract, Duchovny was {{eligible}} for an estimated five percent, but, according to him, he [...] "had seen only a fraction" [...] of the money. Eventually, the lawsuit was settled, and Duchovny was awarded a settlement of about $20 million. The lawsuit put strain on Duchovny's professional relationships. Although his lawsuit never called Chris Carter a defendant, their friendship was notably impacted. One anonymous source noted that [...] "the whole lawsuit thing revealed that Carter knew (Duchovny) was getting screwed and didn't warn him. Carter proved where his loyalties lay with his actions." ...|$|R
5|$|Before {{the seventh}} season aired, Duchovny {{filed a lawsuit}} against 20th Century Fox. He was upset because, he claimed, Fox had <b>undersold</b> the rights <b>to</b> its own affiliates, thereby costing him huge sums of money. Eventually, the lawsuit was settled, and Duchovny was awarded a {{settlement}} of about $20 million. The lawsuit put strain on Duchovny's professional relationships. Neither Carter nor Duchovny <b>was</b> contracted <b>to</b> work on the series beyond the seventh season; however, Fox entered into negotiations near the end of that season in order to bring the two on board for an eighth season. After settling his contract dispute, Duchovny quit full-time participation in the show after the seventh season. This contributed to uncertainties over the likelihood of an eighth season. Carter and most fans felt the show was at its natural endpoint with Duchovny's departure, but it was decided that Mulder would be abducted {{at the end of the}} seventh seasons and would return in 12 episodes the following year. The producers then announced that a new character, John Doggett, would fill Mulder's role.|$|R
