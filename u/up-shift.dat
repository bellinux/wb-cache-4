50|$|Spyder SE5The SE5 has a {{semi-automatic}} transmission, which shifts sequentially 1-2-3-4-5 and 5-4-3-2-1. There is no foot shifter. Instead, a paddle-shifter located {{below the}} left hand-grip {{is used to}} <b>up-shift</b> and down-shift.|$|E
50|$|In modern {{implementations}} if {{the user}} does not shift while {{driving in the}} Autostick mode, the transmission will automatically <b>up-shift</b> at redline (the exception being the Plymouth/Chrysler Prowler which will not shift automatically at redline when in AutoStick mode) to prevent engine/transmission damage, and will not downshift into redline. When coming to a complete stop, the system will automatically return to first gear.|$|E

5000|$|M+ <b>up-shifts</b> a gear in {{sequential}} fashion, from M1 to M5 (M6 in 6-speed AMT cars).|$|R
50|$|The {{system works}} by {{dropping}} the shifter {{down into a}} gated area on the shift assembly which allows the shifter to be pushed to the right (<b>up-shift)</b> or to the left (down-shift). When the driver pushes the shifter in either of these directions the assembly sends {{a signal to the}} TCM to shift up, or down depending on the driver's actions. Dropping the shifter into the Autostick gate while the vehicle is moving will simply keep the vehicle in the current gear selected.|$|E
50|$|Range and {{progression}} are {{not mutually}} exclusive, but each limits the number of options for the other. A wide range, which gives a strong torque multiplication in 1st gear for excellent manners in low-speed traffic, especially with a smaller motor, heavy vehicle, or numerically low axle ratio such as 2.50, means the progression percentages must be high. The amount of engine speed, and therefore power, lost on each <b>up-shift</b> is greater than {{would be the case}} in a transmission with less range, but less power in 1st gear. A numerically low 1st gear, such as 2:1, reduces available torque in 1st gear, but allows more choices of progression.|$|E
5000|$|Modern [...] "Semi-{{automatic}} transmissions" [...] {{usually have}} a fully automatic mode, where the driver {{does not need to}} change gears at all, operating {{in the same manner as}} a conventional type of automatic transmission by allowing the transmission's computer to automatically change gear if, for example, the driver were redlining the engine. The semi-automatic transmission can be engaged in manual mode wherein one can <b>up-shift</b> or down-shift using the console-mounted shifter selecter or the paddle shifters just behind the steering wheel, without the need of a clutch pedal. The ability to shift gears manually, often via paddle shifters, can also be found on certain automatic transmissions (manumatics such as Tiptronic) and continuous variable transmissions (CVTs) (such as Lineartronic).|$|E

50|$|The idea {{of rapid}} {{shifting}} by clutch alone {{has also been}} developed as the dual clutch transmission, in recent high-performance cars. This combines the simplicity of a shifting gearbox with the rapid shifts of a clutch-based design. There are effectively two separate gearboxes, each offering alternate ratios from the overall set, and the two clutches select which gearbox is in effect. Changes within the gearbox are done automatically, to predict which ratio the driver will require next. Provided that the next ratio has been selected correctly (i.e. the computer guessed correctly as to an <b>up-shift</b> vs. a down-shift) the shift itself is merely a rapid movement of the clutch. Unexpected shifts may confuse the system though and it must first select the correct ratio before engaging the clutch, giving a far slower shift.|$|E
50|$|Overdrive ('D', 'OD', or a boxed D or {{the absence}} of an {{illuminated}} 'O/D OFF'): This mode is used in some transmissions to allow early computer-controlled transmissions to engage the automatic overdrive. In these transmissions, Drive (D) locks the automatic overdrive off, but is identical otherwise. OD (Overdrive) in these cars is engaged under steady speeds or low acceleration at approximately 35 - 45 mph. Under hard acceleration or below 35 - 45 mph, the transmission will automatically downshift. Other vehicles with this selector (for example light trucks) will not only disable <b>up-shift</b> to the overdrive gear, but keep the remaining gears available for use of engine braking. Drivers should verify the behaviour of this switch and consider the benefits of reduced friction brake use when city driving where speeds typically do not necessitate the overdrive gear.|$|E
50|$|Beyond {{the ease}} of use from a driver's standpoint, an {{additional}} benefit of sequential manual gearboxes is that use of the clutch via foot pedal or hand control can be minimized or completely obviated, with the clutch used only for starting from a complete stop. Formula One cars of the 1990s made the most high-profile debut of this technology in motor sports, and enhanced variations on this theme are still in use in many forms of road racing and drag racing today. The simple push-pull action of the shift mechanism also lends itself to semi-automatic control using either hydraulic or pneumatic actuators—a system {{often referred to as}} paddle-shift. Instead of a manual gear lever, the driver is provided with (usually) a pair of flipper paddles on the steering wheel, rally cars often utilize just a double-acting single paddle. Pulling on the right-hand paddle makes an <b>up-shift</b> and pulling on the left-hand paddle makes a down-shift. The paddle-shift system will use a sophisticated electronic control unit to provide the necessary logic to operate the shift mechanism. This type of paddle-shift system fitted to race and rally cars {{should not be confused with}} most of the current crop of paddle-shift systems fitted to some high-end road cars. These systems often use a dual-clutch transmission or a conventional torque converter automatic transmission which allow driver input to select the gears.|$|E

50|$|MIS Endurance Due to the {{problems}} in the VIR Endurance and in testing, a larger battery was added to the car for this event (14 amp-hour), and a second fan was installed on the radiator as well as a duct in front of the radiator. After about 7 laps by the first driver the downshift microswitch got stuck and held the pneumatic actuator in the down-shift position. The transmission ended up in first gear, and would not come out of first because the <b>up-shift</b> solenoid could not overcome the already actuated down-shift solenoid. At the end of the 10th lap, the coolant temperature was around 270F. At the final turn of the final lap, the checkered flag was displayed approximately 1 second before the car reached the official holding the flag (based on video slow-motion). The driver did not see the flag and continued around the course. Based on telemetry data, it is evident that there was a loss of oil pressure by about 90% while the coolant temperature was around 270 during this 11th lap. By the ½ way point of the 11th lap the engine began to misfire badly and the driver decided to pull over. At this point the overflow tank was still steaming. The driver was instructed by track workers to cut the engine, and the car was immediately towed away. After watching the video of the event, it was decided that the team leaders would make a compliant to the event organizers regarding the late flag. The whole situation was explained to one of the main organizers, and he informed them that missed flags occur constantly and they just can’t do anything about it. He went on say that if the driver was not given the 3-minute period stipulated in the rules to restart the engine and continue driving, that {{it may have been a}} mistake on their part, and he would talk to the event captain and see what could be done. After 10 minutes he returned to the paddock and explained that the event captain wanted us to return to the course with our second driver and attempt the second half of the event. He further explained that he and the track workers would later inspect the notes and any video evidence, and only if there was definitive proof that the driver was not offered his 3-minute restart period would they consider the second driver’s laps and give us point for the event. The car was immediately returned and the second driver entered the track. The second driver immediately noticed that the sound of the engine was off, and after the first slow section of the course shifted into 3rd gear for the remained of the first lap. At the start of the second lap, the car was passed, and upon pulling onto the course again the driver noticed an increase in the vibration from the engine. The driver then shifted into 4th gear to further reduce the engine RPM. Before the half-way point of the 2nd lap (right before the back sweeper) a loud bang was heard from the engine, and the car began shaking violently. The driver continued through the back sweeper and then pulled off the side of the course. Before being towed back, the driver was handed a small, oily chain by one of the track workers who believed that it came from our engine (which it did). Upon inspection there was a hole in the front bottom of the engine near the #1 cylinder.|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{study of}} significant photon acceleration (frequency <b>up-shift)</b> in a plasma density wake produced by two laser pulses in the mildly relativistic and linearized regime is presented. The wake amplitude is amplified and its phase controlled using two coaxially, co-propagating laser pulses, which {{are considered to}} be identical but separated by a fixed time. A third probe pulse, with a variable delay, is considered as ``test particle'' or quasi-photon propagating through the amplified density wake, which experiences significant photon acceleration because of the local temporal and spatial variation of the permittivity. The evolution of the ``photon'' is studied using Hamiltonian theory. The significant frequency <b>up-shift</b> is much larger than that produced by the wake of a single relativistic laser pulse in the highly relativistic nonlinear wake regime. Our study demonstrates that the inter-pulse separation between the ``controlling'' pulse and the ``driver'' pulse, producing the amplified density wake, can provide an additional degree of freedom for tuning the maximum <b>up-shift</b> of the probe photon frequency...|$|E
40|$|Summary Background Escherichia coli induces {{the heat}} shock {{response}} to a temperature <b>up-shift</b> which {{is connected to the}} synthesis of a characteristic set of proteins, including ATP dependent chaperones and proteases. Therefore the balance of the nucleotide pool is important for the adaptation and continuous function of the cell. Whereas it has been observed in eukaryotic cells, that the ATP level immediately decreased after the temperature shift, no data are available for E. coli about the adenosine nucleotide levels during the narrow time range of minutes after a temperature <b>up-shift.</b> Results The current study shows that a temperature <b>up-shift</b> is followed by a very fast significant transient increase of the cellular ATP concentration within the first minutes. This increase is connected to a longer lasting elevation of the cellular respiration and glucose uptake. Also the mRNA level of typical heat shock genes increases within only one minute after the heat-shock. Conclusion The presented data prove the very fast response of E. coli to a heat-shock and that the initial response includes the increase of the ATP pool which is important to fulfil the need of the cell for new syntheses, {{as well as for the}} function of chaperones and proteases. </p...|$|E
25|$|Downshifting {{is similar}} to <b>up-shifting</b> but in reverse order, and is slower, at 600milliseconds, due to the engine's Electronic Control Unit, or ECU, needing to 'blip' the {{throttle}} so that the engine crankshaft speed can match the appropriate gear shaft speed. The car's computer senses the car slowing down, or more power required (during acceleration), and thus engages a lower gear on the shaft not in use, and then completes the downshift.|$|R
40|$|Most {{thermophilic}} proteins tend to {{have more}} salt bridges, and achieve higher thermostability by <b>up-shifting</b> and broadening their protein stability curves. While the stabilizing effect of salt-bridge has been extensively studied, experimental data on how salt-bridge influences protein stability curves are scarce. Here, we used double mutant cycles to determine the temperature-dependency of the pair-wise interaction energy and the contribution of salt-bridges to DCp in a thermophilic ribosomal protein L 30 e. Our results showed that the pair-wise interaction energies for the salt-bridges E 6 /R 92 and E 62 /K 46 were stabilizing and insensitive to temperature changes from 298 to 348 K. On the other hand, the pair-wise interaction energies between the control long-range ion-pair of E 90 /R 92 were negligible. The DCp of all single and double mutants were determined by Gibbs-Helmholtz and Kirchhoff analyses. We showed that the two stabilizing salt-bridges contributed to a reduction of DCp by 0. 8 – 1. 0 kJ mol 21 K 21. Taken together, our results suggest that the extra salt-bridges found in thermophilic proteins enhance the thermostability of proteins by reducing DCp, leading to the <b>up-shifting</b> and broadening of the protein stability curves...|$|R
40|$|According {{to recent}} models, non-local effects in dual-probesideband Brillouin Optical Time Domain Analysis (BOTDA) systems should be {{essentially}} negligible whenever the probe power {{is below the}} Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS) threshold. This paper shows that actually there appear non-local effects {{in this type of}} systems before the SBS threshold. To explain these effects it is necessary to take into account a full spectral description of the SBS process. The pump pulse experiences a frequency-dependent spectral deformation that affects the readout process differently in the gain and loss configurations. This paper provides a simple analytical model of this phenomenon, which is validated against compelling experimental data, showing good agreement. The main conclusion of our study is that the measurements in gain configuration are more robust to this non-local effect than the loss configuration. Experimental and theoretical results show that, for a total probe wave power of 1 mW (500 μW on each sideband), there is an <b>up-shifting</b> of 1 MHz in the Brillouin Frequency Shift (BFS) retrieved from the Brillouin Loss Spectrum, whereas the BFS extracted from the measured Brillouin Gain Spectrum is <b>up-shifted</b> only 0. 6 MHz. These results are of particular interest for manufacturers of longrange BOTDA systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a new coasting lock-up controller for the {{torque converter clutch}} in automatic transmissions. It was developed to reduce engagement shock and fuel consumption during coasting lock-up, especially when the engine speed drops after a power-off <b>up-shift.</b> P and PI controllers were sequentially adopted in the torque converter clutch control unit without using torque or pressure sensors. In addition, a function of jump-down of command duty was implemented to compensate a sudden increase of engine speed with a high change rate, due to unstable hydraulic pressure. According to the test results in a real vehicle, the new controller fulfilled coasting lock-up successfully after the power-off <b>up-shift,</b> showing diminished engagement shock and improved fuel saving, {{in comparison with the}} conventional controller with bigger duty or engine speed-up control.

40|$|Accumulation of {{misfolded}} {{proteins in}} the cell at high temperature may cause entry into a nonproliferating, heat-shocked state. The imino acid analog azetidine 2 -carboxylic acid (AZC) is incorporated into cellular protein competitively with proline and can misfold proteins into which it is incorporated. AZC addition to budding yeast cells at concentrations sufficient to inhibit proliferation selectively activates heat shock factor (HSF). We find that AZC treatment fails to cause accumulation of glycogen and trehalose (Msn 2 / 4 -dependent processes) or to induce thermotolerance (a protein kinase C-dependent process). However, AZC-arrested cells can accumulate glycogen and trehalose and can acquire thermotolerance {{in response to a}} subsequent heat shock. We find that AZC treatment arrests cells in a viable state and that this arrest is reversible. We find that cells at high temperature or cells deficient in the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc 4 and Ubc 5 are hypersensitive to AZC-induced proliferation arrest. We find that AZC treatment mimics temperature <b>up-shift</b> in arresting cells in G 1 and represses expression of CLN 1 and CLN 2. Mutants with reduced G 1 cyclin-Cdc 28 activity are hypersensitive to AZC-induced proliferation arrest. Expression of the hyperstable Cln 3 – 2 protein prevents G 1 arrest upon AZC treatment and temperature <b>up-shift.</b> Finally, we find that the EXA 3 – 1 mutation, encoding a defective HSF, prevents efficient G 1 arrest in response to both temperature <b>up-shift</b> and AZC treatment. We conclude that nontoxic levels of misfolded proteins (induced by AZC treatment or by high temperature) selectively activate HSF, which is required for subsequent G 1 arrest...|$|E

30|$|Consequently, {{from these}} analyses, we can {{conclude}} that {{the change in the}} band structure of electron-irradiated PCBM is attributed to the modification of the molecular structure of PCBM by electron irradiation (Figure 3). Formation of methoxy-substituted phenyl ring on PCBM <b>up-shifts</b> the LUMO level at low electron fluencies; further electron irradiation deforms the C 60 cage and gradually converts it to hydrogenated amorphous carbon, resulting in the increase of the HOMO-LUMO gap.

30|$|They are 1.2, 1.5, and 2.1  eV for S 1, S 4, and S 5, respectively, by {{assuming}} the field enhancement factor (pristine TNT arrays) is 445 [18].

Therefore, it is reasonable to attribute the enhanced field performance to the grain boundary effect and resultant <b>up-shift</b> of Fermi level which can be interpreted as follows [4, 19]. Polycrystalline materials are composed of small nanocrystalline grains separated by grain boundaries, which lead to a large number of grain boundary defects. These defects are benefit for both electron trapping and electron supply due to the effective conducting pathway. This is the reason for the increase of carrier concentration and subsequent <b>up-shift</b> of Fermi level [19]. This rising Fermi level can reduce the work function (Fig.  4 b) and the effective potential barrier height of TNTs, corresponding to easy electron emission, accounting for the enhanced field emission performance.|$|E
