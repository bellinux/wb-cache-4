He says getting hurt in this world is inevitable, but we do get to choose whom we allow to hurt <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> he is happy with his choice, and hopes she likes her choice too. The book closes with Hazel stating that she is happy with her choice.|$|E
25|$|Circlework is {{a method}} {{developed}} by a German-Jewish author and seminar leader, Jalaja Bonheim (www.jalajabonheim.com), which she has been practicing and teaching in the United States for 25 years, and in Israel since 2005. Circlework uses circle gatherings to create a field of open-heartedness and love powerful enough to heal individuals and communities. Circlework {{is based on the}} assumption that the root causes of violence and war lie within <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> our own consciousness is where change must begin.|$|E
25|$|However, later Pakistani {{officials}} {{have claimed that}} the strike was actually conducted by the <b>U.S.</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> they have also requested the U.S. not to violate their sovereignty again. “We {{thought it would be}} less damaging if we said we did it rather than the US,” said a key aide to President Pervez Musharraf. Local people claimed the victims included boys as young as 12 but Pakistani officials insisted they had been shown satellite images of people training and had checked the identity cards of all those killed, and that all were adults.|$|E

25|$|The point {{really about}} all this from our {{perspective}} {{has been that the}} critical role we should play is to assist the Zimbabweans to find each other, really to agree among themselves about the political, economic, social, other solutions that their country needs. We could have stepped aside from that task and then shouted, {{and that would be the}} end of our contribution... They would shout back at <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> would be the end of the story. I'm actually the only head of government that I know anywhere in the world who has actually gone to Zimbabwe and spoken publicly very critically of the things that they are doing.|$|E

In 2010, a spokesman for Robertson said that the company's arrangements—in which the Liberian government got a 10 percent equity interest in the company and Liberians could purchase at least 15 percent of the shares after the exploration period—were similar to many American companies doing business in Africa at the time.|$|E
25|$|It (Independence) {{belongs to}} all of <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> is why we {{celebrate}} it. Do you think, however, that our nation from the outset needs only men to serve it? Women should also take their part as women did {{in the early years}} of our nation and Islam. From their examples we must learn that we must all contribute toward the development of our nation and that this cannot be done without being equipped with knowledge. So we should all attempt to acquire as much knowledge as possible, in order that we may render our services to society in the manner of the women of early Islam.|$|E

25|$|Carrie convinces Saul to put Allison under surveillance, {{despite the}} fact that he and Allison are in a relationship. They then lead her to believe that an SVR chief has {{defected}} to the <b>U.S.,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> he has documents revealing how the CIA had been infiltrated. Allison panics and goes to her handler, Ivan Krupin (Mark Ivanir), which allows the CIA to put her under arrest. Carrie then sees a news report showing video of Islamic State terrorists poisoning Quinn with sarin, and threatening to unleash a chemical attack on a major European city in 24 hours. Carrie traces the video to an address in Berlin, where she finds Quinn, barely alive. Quinn ultimately lives, but is left in a coma.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, the FBI warned Ireland {{that a major}} IRA arms {{shipment}} {{was underway}} from the <b>US,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> the weaponry would be transferred to an Irish fishing trawler in the Atlantic. Subsequently, Irish authorities discovered that arms ship was a vessel named Marita Ann, allegedly after a tip off Sean O'Callaghan, an IRA informant for the Garda Síochána (police of the Republic of Ireland). Three Irish Naval Service ships confronted the vessel {{off the coast of}} County Kerry, and prevented its escape by firing warning shots. A team of naval personnel and Garda officers boarded the ship, arresting the crew of five and confiscating seven tons of military equipment, as well as medications, training manuals, and communications equipment. The weapons had been donated by the South Boston Winter Hill Irish Mob.|$|E
25|$|A major {{divide in}} {{political}} opinion separates the region's greatly more populated urban core {{and rural areas}} west of the mountains from its less populated rural areas to their east and (in British Columbia and Alaska) north. The coastal areas—especially in the cities of Vancouver, Victoria, Bellingham, Seattle, Tacoma, Olympia, Portland, Eugene, and Ashland—are {{some of the most}} politically liberal parts of North America, regularly supporting left-wing political candidates and causes by significant majorities, while the Interior and North tend to be more conservative and consistently support right-wing candidates and causes. It {{should be noted that the}} religious right has far less influence throughout the region than elsewhere in the <b>U.S.,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> certain areas of the BC Interior, particularly the West Kootenay and some areas of Vancouver Island and the BC Coast, have long histories of labour, environmental and social activism (see History of British Columbia#Rise of the labour movement).|$|E

500|$|The battle had {{significant}} effects within the Scots community of North Carolina, where Loyalists refused {{to turn out}} when calls to arms were made later in the war, and many were routed {{out of their homes}} by the pillaging activities of their Patriot neighbors.

500|$|Not all of {{the members}} of the {{administration}} agreed that an invasion of Cambodia was either militarily or politically expedient. Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird and Secretary Rogers were both opposed to any such operation due to their belief that it would engender intense domestic opposition in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> it might possibly derail the ongoing peace negotiations in Paris (they had both opposed the Menu bombings for the same reasons). Both were castigated by Henry Kissinger for their [...] "bureaucratic foot-dragging."

Ammendola told Drum Media winning the award was more significant than an ARIA Award, as [...] "it's an award that's nominated on the grounds of music, and the art of it - not necessarily record sales". The band used the A$25,000 prize money to help fund a US tour.
