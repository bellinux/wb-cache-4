The chosen parameters determine metal dilution, properties formation, and the surface appearance of the joint, and the properties of the base metals and filler metal, if used, must be considered in welding parameter selection. However, various studies concur that in dissimilar joints, solid-state welding shows better joint formation than fusion welding processes. For instance, the mechanical properties of Al-Cu joints can be enhanced in friction welding processes by selecting appropriate friction time, pressure and <b>upset</b> <b>pressure.</b> Sahin (2009) showed that the tensile strength of a joint increases until a peak value and then decreases gradually with further increase in friction pressure and time.

In the past, the exhaust valves in large marine diesel engines have been made through free forging by using the stretch forming method. This method has used the ingot and the billet as a preliminary forming process. Nimonic 80 A, a superalloy, is presently used for the material of the exhaust valve.

40|$|In foundry {{practice}} {{the occurrence of}} solidification defects limits the production {{and the performance of}} cast components. In high-pressure die casting (HPDC) the most common defects are shrinkage or gas porosities and bifilms. Thin sections, typical of HPDC components, are the most susceptible to casting defects, and these microstructural imperfections can be detrimental to both the mechanical and aesthetic properties. Even though laminations are not as harmful as internal defects, die cast components with this kind of superficial defects are always rejected by customers, thus requiring further machining operations. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyse the lamination defects that occur on the surface of some Al-Si-Cu cast covers produced by means of HPDC.

In the present thesis dedicated cold pressure welding experiments with dissimilar aluminum alloys have been performed. The alloy combinations investigated were cold-deformed AA 5183 and soft-annealed AA 5183 (Series II) and cold-deformed AA 5183 and commercial purity AA 1050 (Series III). In both series metallic bonding is initiated when a critical value of the compressive plastic strain is reached. A small increase in the strain beyond this threshold leads to full metallic bonding.

Instead, the cold-deformed AA 5183 material starts to penetrate the soft AA 1050 wire. This leads to build-up of an internal extrusion pressure approaching that of the cold-deformed AA 5183 material.

40|$|The wet {{chemical}} synthesis of BaTiO_ 3, through gel-to-crystallite conversions involves {{the reaction of}} coarse TiO_ 2. xH_ 2 O (10 <x< 120) gels, free of anionic contaminants, with Ba(OH) _ 2, solutions under refluxing conditions at T≤ 100 ^o C, giving rise to nanosized crystallites. The paper focuses on the mechanism of formation of BaTi 0 _ 3. The reaction kinetics were monitored for various temperatures and concentrations and {{were found to be}} strongly dependent on Ba(OH) _ 2, concentration. Two regions of concentration could be detected: below 0. 15 M Ba(OH) _ 2, polytitanates are formed, whereas at higher concentrations, i. e., greater than 0. 15 M, perovskite phase is stabilised. Analyses of the kinetic data were carried out using various kinetic models used for heterogeneous reactions. Under higher concentrations of Ba(OH) _ 2 a bulk diffusional process dominates, accompanied by the collapse of the gel and a large decrease in volume. The present results also indicate the general features of gel-to-crystallite conversions, involving instability of the metal hydroxide gel brought about by the <b>upset</b> of ionic <b>pressure</b> in the gel, as a result of faster migration of Ba^ 2 + ions through the solvent cavities within the gel framework. It is proposed that with increasing pH within the gel, de-olation of the bridging groups such as Ti-OH-Ti and Ti-O-Ti takes place, followed by oxolation, leading to the formation of corner-sharing TiO_ 6 octahedra that are charge-compensated by Ba^ 2 + ions...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{investigate}} the factors influencing the resistance upset butt welding process to obtain {{an understanding of the}} metal behaviour and welding process characteristics, so that new automotive steels can be welded with reduced development time and fewer failures in production. In principle the welding process is rather simple, the materials to be joined are clamped between two electrodes and pressed together. Because there is an interface present with a higher resistance than the base material, heat will be generated at the joint position once the welding current and voltage are applied. As soon as the material is warm and soft enough, an extra (<b>upsetting)</b> <b>pressure</b> is applied and a weld is formed. For making wheel rims, after welding, the upset is removed by means of chisels and shear cut- ting the edges of the weld, followed by rolling the remaining material into the rim. After the upset has been removed the wheel rim is cold formed in several steps to its final shape. For the {{purpose of this}} research 2. 0 mm thick S 460 MC and 1. 65 mm thick HR 45 steel were examined at a test welding facility at Fontijne Grotnes BV. Both steels were specially developed for cold forming and deep drawing purposes and have a mainly ferritic microstructure. An initial research into the crack formation in wheel rims during production was performed, proving that there were no hard and crack susceptible microstructures present in the weld area of the researched materials. The idea that the wheel rims crack due to for example to the presence of bainite and martensite was rejected. There were two main types of cracks discovered, large cracks which are formed due to initial misalignment of the sheets, grease and/or oil at the interface during welding and an uneven heat distribution during welding. The other type of cracks were micro-cracks, which originate from notches introduced during the trimming and rolling of the wheel rim edges after welding. A good alignment of the chisels and cutting tools is necessary to minimise the amount of material that is pushed into the wheel rim Because it was not feasible to do welding experiments in a full wheel rim welding machine at a production facility, the Fontijne Holland Welderr was employed, this is a scaled down version of a production welding machine, but without the material feed or post weld handling facilities. During welding it was observed that the weld sample did not heat up evenly, the emitted light at the interface was brighter at some places than at others. Also after welding the oxidation of the joint area showed that there was a non-uniform heating, with warmer and colder areas. This non-uniformity results in non-uniform weld characteristics and weld quality differences over the length of the weld. Tensile tests of samples taken both from the edges and the centre of welded samples showed that the maximum tensile strength can be as high as 95 % of the tensile strength of the base material. However, the strain to failure of the welded samples was only a maximum of 60 % with a 30 % difference between the central test sample and the edge samples. Erichsen testing was also employed to provide an indication of weld quality. Only the centre of samples was tested due to the way the Erichsen tester is constructed. The Erichsen height was upto 85 % of the base material height for the welded samples and it was found that if there are no edge defects present, the Erichsen test is a quick and valid weld quality test. Due to observed non-uniform weld quality and heating of the weld area, the focus of the research shifted to understanding why there was a non-uniformity present. Temperature measurements both by thermal camera and thermocouples showed that there is indeed a non-uniform temperature distribution present during welding over the joint interface. The outer edges of the joint line have higher temperatures than {{the central part of the}} weld. Local difference can be as high as 300 K over just 20 mm distance. Also there are hot spots present at either end of the joint line approximately 10 mm from the edges. These hot spots can give rise to local melting in steels with low melting temperature segregation bands. The causes of the uneven temperature distribution were sought. Employing local current measurements during welding was not possible, however when the welding process is just started and there has been no signifcant heating of the weld sample, it is possible to link the voltage distribution directly to the current density distribution. Measuring voltage distributions is relatively easy, voltage probes were spot welded to the surface of the weld samples and measurements showed that there was a non- uniform voltage distribution present during welding. This non-uniformity had the same distribution as the temperature distribution, low voltages at the places were the temperatures were low and high voltage signals where the temperatures were high. Because the non-uniform voltage distribution was measured for both 1 and 2 -piece samples (samples with and without an interface) it can be concluded that the boundary conditions governed by the welding equipment have a major influence. The influence of the clamping system and the contact surface of the electrodes were researched to determine their its influence on the heating of the weld area. It was shown that the clamping pressure of the samples was not high enough to prevent slip of the samples during welding and that the samples had to be positioned in the centre of the electrodes to minimise non-uniform heating. At the places of the highest local pressure, the contact resistance is the lowest and heating will consequently be slower at those locations. The highest edge temperatures were measured at the far end of the electrodes, where the lowest clamping pressures are expected. To obtain more uniform heating it is necessary to obtain a more uniform current distribution. This can be accomplished by changing the contact interface between the electrode and the sample surface or the interface between the weld samples. Adapting the electrodes has a small influence but will also result in longer welding times due to a decrease in contact surface area (decrease of 10 % results in a 5 % increase in weld time). The interface change can decrease the welding time by up to 20 % due to a local faster initial heating. Unfortunately the change in interface surface resulted in less repeatable welds. Residual stress in the welded samples was also examined. Both samples with the upset present as well as samples where the upset was removed were measured. The samples with the weld present showed tensile stresses at the centre of the joint line, but compressive stresses at the edges of the sample. When the upset was removed the overall stress state of the sheet became more neutral, the compressive and tensile stress peaks become lower. The stress distribution was explained conceptually with the aid of a modified bar model. Modelling with both MS. Marc and ABAQUS was employed in this research to obtain a better understanding of the complex electrical, thermal and mechanical relationships as observed during real experiments. Three different models were developed, a thermal model, a thermo-mechanical model and a local strain model. The local strain model showed that the Erichsen testing method is a valid method for weld quality assessment. The modelled total strain observed during flaring of wheel rims was lower than the modelled and measured strain during Erichsen testing. Both the thermal and thethermo-mechanical models are predictive. The first one is based on input parameters directly coming from measurements during welding experiments. The thermo-mechanical model is based on the temperature dependent material parameters. The initial thermal model was designed to determine if the non-uniform current density distribution, as measured during experiments, could result in a non-uniform heating of the weld area. The model did not include any temperature dependent parameters nor a mechanical coupling. This showed that the non-uniform current input resulted in a non-uniform heating of the sample. By obtaining a more uniform current distribution over the length of the joint area, a more uniform heating can be obtained. It was also indicated that around contaminations at the interface, either conductive or insulating, a locally higher temperature exists. The mechan- ical model is a more realistic model as it includes the upsetting force. The model predicts the formation of the upset when there are misalignments of the sheets during welding. Because this model includes the temperature dependent material parameters, it is possible to predict the residual stresses after welding, which are in qualitative agreement with the measured residual stresses in real welds.

Tests were conducted with different welding process parameters. The results were analyzed by means of tensile test, Vickers micro hardness test, fatigue test, Charpy v-notch impact test, and SEM-EDX (energy dispersive X-ray) analysis {{in order to determine}} the phases that occurred during welding. The strength of the joints varied with increasing friction pressure and friction time keeping <b>upset</b> <b>pressure</b> and upset time constant. The joint strength increased, and then decreased after reaching a maximum value, with increasing friction pressure and friction time. The process of friction welding between the aluminum alloy and the stainless steel is proposed to evolve as follows: welding progresses from the outer to the inner region; an unbounded region is retained at the centre of the weld interface with shorter friction time; longer friction time causes the formation of an intermetallic reaction layer at the weld interface and the reaction layer grows as the friction time increases. Some of the welds had poor strength due to the accumulation of alloying elements at the joint interface. When the thickness of the reaction layer increased above a critical value, the joint was brittle and fractured at the weld interface. The joint was sound when there was no unbounded region and a thin reaction layer formed along the entire weld interface...|$|E
40|$|The {{challenges}} of weight reduction and good strength in automotive industry have drawn considerable interest in thixocasting technologies. Joining of such components with conventional fusion welding creates voids, hot cracking, distortion in shape, {{and more importantly}} evolution of dendritic microstructure that ultimately would lead to inferior mechanical properties of the weld region. Thus, the purpose of making thixocast component is lost. The friction welding which is a solid state joining process can avoid defects associated with melting and solidification in a typical fusion weld and can be a promising alternative. This process produces a weld under compressive force at the contact of workpieces rotating or moving relative to one another to produce heat and plastically displacing material from the faying surfaces. Research on semisolid processing has its origin in the early 1970 s. However, from the literature survey on semisolid processing it is clear that, till date, not much {{work has been done}} in field of joining of semisolid processed components. In the area of solid state welding, in particular, {{it is not at all}} explored. In view of this, the present work is focused on exploration of joining of Thixocast A 356 Aluminium alloy component by friction welding and comparison of its performance with friction weld of conventionally cast sample of the same alloy. The study is carried out experimentally as well as numerically. Moreover, the material behaviour of thixocast component at elevated temperature in solid state is also described with the help of processing maps and constitutive modelling. The hot workability of thixocast and conventionally cast A 356 alloy is evaluated with the help of processing maps developed on the basis of the dynamic materials model approach using the flow stress data obtained from the isothermal compression test in wide range of temperature (300 - 500 ℃) and strain rates (0. 001 s- 1 - 10 s- 1). The domains of the processing map are interpreted in terms of the associated microstructural mechanism. On comparing the flow stress at elevated temperature of thixocast and conventionally cast A 356 alloy samples, it is observed that the flow stress of the latter showed higher value at different strain level, temperature and strain rates. This indicates that the flow property of the thixocast alloy sample is better than that of the conventionally cast one (i. e. response to plastic flow is better for the former); while at room temperature thixocast sample has higher strength. Moreover to investigate the general nature of the influence of strain, strain rate and temperature on the compressive deformation characteristics of thixocast A 356 and conventionally cast A 356 aluminium alloy, a comprehensive model describing the relationship of the flow stress, strain rate and temperature of the alloys at elevated temperatures is proposed by hyperbolic-sine Arrhenius-type equation and Johnson-Cook model. The validity of descriptive results based on the proposed constitutive equation is also investigated and a comparison between two constitutive models is also made. In order to numerically model the friction welding process of a thixocast A 356 aluminium alloy and conventionally cast alloy of same material using a finite element method (FEM), temperature dependent physical properties, mechanical properties as well as viscoplastic constitutive equations were used in the model. A two- dimensional axisymmetric finite element model has been developed. The modelling is based on a coupled thermomechanical approach. First, a nonlinear, transient two-dimensional heat transfer model is developed to determine the temperature fields. Later, the temperature fields are used as input for a nonlinear, two-dimensional structural model in order to predict the distortions and von Mises stress. The finite element models are parametrically built using APDL (ANSYS Parametric Design Language) provided by ANSYS. The validation of the model is carried out by comparing with the experiment. Once validated, the thermomechanical model was used to perform parametric studies in order to investigate effects of various process parameters on temperature and stress distribution in the workpieces. This helps in deciding the range of parameters for friction welding experiments in order to get good weld. Both thixocast and conventionally cast samples exhibited similar temperature distribution during the friction welding process, because of identical thermophysical properties. The magnitude of von Mises stress distribution during friction welding of thixocast A 356 sample is found to be lower than that of the conventionally cast sample. It is because of their different constitutive behaviour at elevated temperature. Moreover, the developed FEM model can be successfully used to predict the residual stress at various locations for different set of parameters and geometry for friction welding of thixocast and conventionally cast A 356 alloy. This helps in reducing time consuming and expensive experiments on residual stress measurement. The chosen experiments based on Taguchi L 27 orthogonal array were conducted on the friction welding machine which works on the principles of continuous drive-mechanism. The experimental specimens were machined from thixocast A 356 aluminium alloy connecting rods as well as conventionally cast A 356 aluminium alloy ingot in the form of cylindrical bars of dimensions 85 mm length and 20 mm diameter. The parameters used for welding were friction pressure, rpm, forge pressure, burn-off, and <b>upset</b> <b>pressure.</b> The effects of welding parameters on performance characteristics (i. e. tensile strength and weld efficiency) were evaluated. Taguchi method was applied to investigate the influence of each parameter on strength of joints and evaluate the combination of parameters that leads to the highest weld strength. Accordingly optimum process parameters was identified which helps in achieving the tensile strength of more than parent material. The optimized process parameters for friction welding of thixocast A 356 aluminium alloy are rpm = 500, friction pressure = 60, upset time = 5, <b>upset</b> <b>pressure</b> = 100 and burn off = 5. The empirical relationships were also developed to predict the tensile strength. The developed relationship can be effectively used to predict the tensile strength of welded joint with a correlation coefficient of 0. 86, which indicates the strong positive relationship between predicted and experimental data. Friction welding of thixocast A 356 aluminium alloy helps to achieve very fine eutectic silicon particles of the order of 0. 4 at the interface due to severe plastic deformation taking place during welding. Obtaining such fine eutectic silicon particles is difficult to be achieved within few seconds of processing by any other method. The hardness variation of friction welded thixocast alloy shows higher value as compared to that of a conventionally cast sample in the heat affected zone, which indicates better weld strength of the former. This was also confirmed by the tensile strength studied and fatigue test. This indicates that weldability of cast alloys will get improved if the microstructure is modified to globular type...|$|E
