40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to explore the <b>use</b> and perceptions <b>of</b> a local Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Extranet and its potential to support future information and communication applications. The SARS Extranet was a single, managed electronic and limited access system to manage local, provincial and other SARS control information. Methods During July, 2003, a web-based and paper-based survey was conducted with 53 SARS Steering Committee members in Hamilton. It assessed the <b>use</b> and perceptions <b>of</b> the <b>Extranet</b> that had been built to support the committee during the SARS outbreak. Before distribution, the survey was user-tested based on a think-aloud protocol, and revisions were made. Quantitative and qualitative questions were asked related to frequency <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Extranet,</b> perceived overall usefulness of the resource, rationale for use, potential barriers, strengths and limitations, and potential future <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Extranet.</b> Results The response rate was 69. 4 % (n = 34). Of all respondents, 30 (88. 2 %) reported that they had visited the site, and rated it highly overall (mean = 4. 0; 1 = low to 5 = high). However, the site was rated 3. 4 compared with other communications strategies used during the outbreak. Almost half of all respondents (44. 1 %) visited the site at least once every few days. The two most common reasons the 30 respondents visited the Extranet were to access SARS Steering Committee minutes (63. 3 %) and to access Hamilton medical advisories (53. 3 %). The most commonly cited potential future uses for the Extranet were the sending of private emails to public health experts (63. 3 %), and surveillance (63. 3 %). No one encountered personal barriers in his or her <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the site, but several mentioned that time and duplication of email information were challenges. Conclusion Despite higher rankings of various communication strategies during the SARS outbreak, such as email, meetings, teleconferences, and other web sites, users generally perceived a local Extranet as a useful support for the dissemination of local information during public health emergencies. </p...|$|R

40|$|Project extranets {{are adopted}} to improve {{information}} management, communication and collaborative working in construction industry. Previous {{studies have demonstrated}} their development, evolution and implementation. The benefits, barriers and success factors surrounding the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> project <b>extranets</b> are also documented. However, although the general functionalities <b>of</b> project <b>extranets</b> have been identified and described, {{there is still a}} lack of systematic way to analyze the functionalities provided by different systems and required by various users. To bridge this gap, this research develops a novel approach aiming to find the differences, major components and potential improvements from the integrated analysis to systems' provisions and user requirements. This approach, named, Provision & Requirement (P&R) approach starts with the reviews to the development and <b>use</b> <b>of</b> project <b>extranets</b> and outlines the characteristics of such systems. It has then listed and grouped the function and associated features into some categories, in order to set the criteria for the analysis from system provisions and user requirements. Afterwards, it conducts investigations by case study and questionnaire survey, aiming to gather functionalities provided by selected sample systems and to elicit user requirements to the listed functionalities. The results help the author to classify the functionalities hierarchically based on their availability in the products and users' preferences. The investigations have therefore established the fundament for proposing the P&R approach and conduct further analysis by comparing the provisions and requirements. Through the analysis, the author reaches research findings, by presenting the differences, major components and possible improvements of functionalities <b>of</b> project <b>extranets.</b> Later, the research findings are validated and proposed approach is consolidated by interviews, leading to the answers to the research questions and concluding research outcomes. The main contribution of this research is that it develops a novel approach to analyze functionalities in project extranets. This approach aims to integrate both systems provisions and user requirements into consideration. By doing so, this approach studies system vendors and users' perspectives to functionality issues, to reflect their respective attitude and make the comparison, in order that researchers can have wider knowledge from different research angles and achieve the balance on the issues of systems' provisions and user requirements. So, this research has established a holistic approach of analysing functionalities <b>of</b> project <b>extranets,</b> rather than focusing only on one part from either vendors or users, which in return has contributed to its uniqueness and distinctiveness. The result may be useful to system vendors, customers and researchers involved in the development and implementation <b>of</b> project <b>extranets</b> or other web-based information systems. The research has put forward to the ideas for other similar research, with more holistic consideration to all stakeholders involved in the studied topics. It {{can also be used to}} develop other methodologies that consider the adaptation of elements of one industry's practice to another, thus satisfying other research gaps...|$|R
40|$|Today {{the extent}} and value of {{electronic}} data is constantly growing. Dealing across the internet depends on how secure consumers believe their personal data are. And therefore, information security becomes essential to any business with any form of web strategy, from simple business-to-consumer, or business-to-business to the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>extranets,</b> e-mail and instants messaging. It matters too any organization that depends on computers for its daily existence. This master thesis has its focus on Information Security Governance. The goal of this thesis was to study different Information Security processes within the five objectives for Information Security Governance {{in order to identify}} which processes that organizations should prioritize in order to reduce negative consequences on the data, information and software of a business from security incidents. By surveying IT experts, it was possible to gather their relative opinion regarding the relationship between Information Security Governance processes and security incidents. By studying the five desired objectives for Information Security Governance, Strategic Alignment, Risk Management, Resource Management, Performance Measurement and Value Delivery the result indicated that some processes within Performance Measurements have a difference in relation to other processes. For those processes a conclusion can be made that they are not as important as the processes which they were compared to. A reason for this can be that the processes within performance measurement are different {{in such a way that}} they measure an incident after it has actually happened. While other processes within the objectives for ISG are processes which needs to be fulfilled in order to prevent that an incident happens. This could obviously explain why the expert‟s choose to value the processes within performance measurement less important compared to other processes. However, this conclusion cannot be generalized, since the total amount of completed responses where less than expected. More respondents would have made the result more reliable. The majority of the respondents were academicals and their opinion and experience may be different from the IT experts within the industry, which have a better understanding of how it actually works in reality within an organization...|$|R

The purpose of our study is {{to gain a better}} understanding <b>of</b> <b>extranet</b> adoption in SCM and to find out the benefits and drawbacks <b>of</b> the <b>extranet</b> adoption. Our study showed with empirical data of two company’s (LKAB, Sweden and DHL, Bangladesh unit) that there is a direct relationship between organizational factors and extranet adoption. Organizational factors should be taken into consideration actively to see and measure how these factors are affecting the adoption processes to calibrate organizational practices to gain utmost benefits. The extranet investigated differed from what the literature suggested on many points. One of the features that has been revealed from the study that LKAB did not perceive most <b>of</b> the <b>extranet</b> benefits, and the reason is that LKAB has only few fixed customers and they used their extranet system as a supplementary services to their core businesses. On the other hand, DHL made the extranet system as their core business process: thus acknowledging most of the benefits in a positive way. Extranet has the potential to provide far more benefits to companies than they perceive and it is changing faster than the literature emerges. Technological improvements offset major disadvantages that once researchers considered obstacle to extranet implementation.

We identify two types <b>of</b> e-procurement systems: <b>extranets</b> and electronic markets. Extranets connect the buyer and its suppliers with a closed network. In contrast, electronic markets create open networks for buyer and supplier interactions.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of electronic commerce has led {{more and more}} companies to, in addition to using resellers, add the Internet to sell directly to its end customers, something that inevitably will create channel conflict. The way companies handle such conflict is considered an important success factor. The importance of this issue, along {{with the lack of}} research focusing upon it, created the foundation for this study. In addition to the dysfunctional aspects of conflict, this study aimed at capturing the functional aspects of conflict as perceived by management. Hence, the research problem of this thesis was to explore and describe managers' perspectives on conflict in multiple marketing channels, with a focus on the Internet. Based on the literature review, a frame of reference was created comprising both text and a graphical display, which defined the boundaries of this research. An interview guide with open-ended questions was then developed from the frame of reference to address the following issues: 1) the causes of channel conflict; 2) how the seriousness of channel conflict can be assessed; and 3) the approaches {{that can be used to}} reduce channel conflict. A qualitative research approach was adopted and case studies were conducted. The empirical data were collected through personal interviews at Ducati and Scandinavian Airlines. Even though the respondents described some channel conflict, it must be noted that the management of both companies emphasized that they have a very good working relationship with their resellers, although on rare occurrence they have encountered problems. Furthermore, although they had experienced some conflict due to the addition of the Internet, there was no more channel conflict because of the Internet than before that channel was added. In addition, the Internet can in fact reduce channel conflict, as both companies referred to the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> an <b>Extranet</b> for this purpose. Results from this study also indicate that one of the generally accepted causes of channel conflict-differing perceptions of reality-should be replaced with communication problems, since differing perceptions of reality seem to be the result of poor communication. Moreover, when assessing whether a channel conflict has positive or negative implications for a company, it seems that one important factor to look at is its impact on the company's brand.

40|$|In {{their book}} Blown to Bits: How the New Economics of Information Transforms Strategy, authors Evans and Wurster see the {{transfer}} of information as a 'trade-off between richness and reach'. Reach refers {{to the number of}} people who share particular information, with Richness ('Rich') being a more complex concept combining: bandwidth, customisation, interactivity, reliability, security and currency. They argue that with the advent of powerful information and communication technologies, this historic trade-off between Richness and Reach - in general the greater the reach, the less the richness, and vice-versa - may no longer apply. It is now possible to have increasing amounts of both Reach and Richness. In the context of the marketplace for legal services, the concepts of Reach and Richness have a resonance with, for example, Susskind's latent legal marketplace and the interaction and community advocated by Terrett. This paper has two inter-related themes. Firstly, it describes Evans and Wurster's concepts, and relates them to recent literature regarding the impact of technology on the marketplace for legal services in the United Kingdom (UK). In particular, it is suggested that Richness and Reach can be used to extend The Legal Grid, Richard Susskind's tool for analysing the strategic impact of technology on the legal practice. To test the refined tool, the second part of the paper examines a particular application of technology - the provision of public access Web sites by UK legal practices. Using James Ho's value-added Matrix as a tool for measuring the 'Richness' dimension of the site, the results of two surveys of legal firms' public access Web sites are presented. Combining both the theoretical and empirical aspects of the paper, a number of issues are considered including the Web as a 'democratising' opportunity for smaller firms, and the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> client-specific <b>Extranets,</b> in addition to publicly available Internet sites. The paper concludes that although the Web provides Reach, offering Richness and the sense of community required for creating and sustaining relationships with potential clients could be difficult.

40|$|A recent {{series of}} scandals hitting the UK {{financial}} industry {{has had a}} negative impact on consumer confidence in UK insurance companies. After assuming its powers and responsibility under the Financial Services and Market Act 2000, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) becomes the single statutory regulator directly responsible for the regulation of deposit taking, insurance and investment business. Strong legislation was introduced to maintain IFAs' independence, prohibiting insurance companies from exerting or persuading more IFAs to promote their products. Fighting to survive in an increasingly competitive market, several insurance companies have adopted the extranet to improve their communication and relationships with IFAs. Whilst channel relationship literature insists on the important role of communication in the supplier-distributor relationship, the emerging role <b>of</b> the <b>extranet</b> and how it reshapes IFA-insurer communication and relationships has hardly been explored. Accordingly, the research problem investigated in this thesis is: How has the extranet impacted on communication and relationships between the insurer and independent financial advisors (IE 4 s) in the UK? The research problem was investigated in two stages. In Stage 1, face-to-face interviews were carried out to help identify 5 research issues. RI 1 : How does the extranet facilitate insurer-IFA communication? RI 2 : How does the extranet impact on the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> other communication media? RI 3 : How does the extranet facilitate the insurer-IFA relationship? RI 4 : Impact <b>of</b> the <b>extranet</b> on communication, trust, commitment, cooperation, and conflict - How does this facilitate the quality of relationship between insurers and IFAs? RI 5 : Does the perceived impact <b>of</b> the <b>extranet</b> on commitment have the strongest impact {{on the quality of the}} insurer-IFA relationship? in Stage 2, a mail survey of UK independent financial advisors was conducted to explore the research issues. In answering the research issues,this thesis' findings make the following contributions. Firstly, this research found that the extranet has a positive impact on insurer- IFA communication in general. However, it is still not conclusive that the extranet increases two-way communication between them. Secondly, this research found that it is highly likely that the extranet will decrease the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> certain modes of communication especially, the facsimile and the telephone. Thirdly, this research found that the extranet improves certain aspects of trust. In terms of commitment, although the extranet increases the IFAs' willingness to maintain their relationship with the insurer, it does not have a strong impact on the IFAs' commitment to the insurer. Concerning the co-operation construct, it is still inconclusive whether the communication enhanced by the extranet leads to better co-operation between the insurer and IFAs. Likewise, it is still not conclusive if the extranet-enhanced communication results in less conflict between the insurer and IFAs. Nevertheless, it is clear that the extranet does not intensify existing disagreements between them. Overall, the IFAs felt that the extranet-enhanced communication increased the quality of their relationship with the insurer. Next, this research found that the perceived impact <b>of</b> the <b>extranet</b> on relationship quality is positively related to the perceived impact <b>of</b> the <b>extranet</b> on trust, commitment, and co-operation and negatively related to the perceived impact <b>of</b> the <b>extranet</b> on conflict and, disagreement. Indeed, insurers need to be aware that to enhance the quality of their relationship with the IFA, they need to maintain and increase the IFAs' trust in, and commitment to them. At the same time, they should also try to facilitate co-operation and effectively solve conflicts between them and the IFAs. This research found that the extranet has the potential to help the insurer achieve these goals if it is implemented appropriately and effectively. Finally, the findings also suggest that commitment has the strongest effect on the perceived quality of relationship...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an integrated project extranet design prototype for the architects, engineers and contractors {{in a typical}} construction setting in Hong Kong and mainland China (known as "e-AEC"), {{with the aim of}} achieving technological and organizational integration. Internet, Information-sharing, Database, and Firewall technologies are applied for achieving such an aim, and discussions are provided as to how e-AEC can be used to support the construction industry, which has been slow in adopting Information Technology. Previous literature on project extranets and related commercial products are provided. A questionnaire survey with local construction professionals was conducted to identify the requirements of a construction project extranet. Two key requirements have been identified, including information database and interactive services such as online forum, engineering and management database, files transfer, and industry newsletters. In this connection, the benefits <b>of</b> project <b>extranets</b> and the barriers to successful implementation <b>of</b> project <b>extranets</b> have been identified. A case study on a railway project was conducted {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} e-AEC. The findings suggest that it could be an effective project information and communication management tool.

40|$|The Ultranet {{is a form}} <b>of</b> <b>extranet</b> {{set up by the}} Victorian Education Department and {{designed}} to allow students to access personalised learning activities and to keep an ongoing record of these activities. It is intended to facilitate teachers in creation of curriculum plans, collaboration with other teachers, monitoring of student progress and providing for convenient student assessment. The idea is also that parents are able to access the Ultranet to see information that would keep them up-to-date with their child&# 039;s learning. While the Ultranet has many of the features found in learning management systems such as Blackboard or Moodle, it also has many other features intended to inform parents about their child&# 039;s education and about the school they attend. Powerful tools like this will change the ways that education managers can operate. The Ultranet appears {{to be one of the}} first attempts to include all these features in order to inform parents of school children about their school and to provide their teachers with facilities to work collaboratively.

40|$|Extranets are {{the third}} wave of Internet technology. In {{business-to-business}} relationships more and more companies offer Extranets that – while maintaining privacy and confidentiality – make internal information available to business partners and offer process integration via the World Wide Web. Especially for small companies an Extranet is an appealing alternative to EDI technology. Despite all the potential benefits, {{a large number of}} companies do not use or outright reject Extranet technology. The purpose of this exploratory study is to find out the reasons of non-use/rejection. A questionnaire-based mail survey was conducted in March 2001 among 2080 German retailers, all of them customers of a large manufacturer of white goods with access to the supplier’s Extranet system. Roughly 1 / 3 of the respondents do not use the Extranet. Responses to open questions provide qualitative data that is analysed by cut-and-sort technique and content analysis. The findings show that information quality and design quality <b>of</b> the <b>Extranet</b> system are relevant factors for the acceptance/rejection <b>of</b> an <b>Extranet</b> system. However, this is not the main reason. The quality of the traditional channel tremendously reduces the willingness of adapting that new technology. Especially the need for interpersonal contact is the main reason for system non-use among small retailers. Retailers who have frequent transactions with the supplier prefer face-to-fac...|$|R

40|$|The {{advent of}} Internet has deeply {{changed the way}} we live. More than just moving our daily reading, {{shopping}} and entertaining to an on line environment, the Internet has been regarded as the catalyst for companies to reconsider their business modes and processes. A new business model: e-business, was then born. The size of this new model is remarkable and it keeps growing nowadays. The <b>extranet,</b> a level <b>of</b> connection of the Internet, is a relatively young business to business (B 2 B) technology. It has gained a lot of attention from both managers and researchers, since it possesses plenty of potential benefits. This thesis studies the particular case <b>of</b> the <b>extranet</b> applied to the supply activities occurring between the buyer and its established suppliers. The objectives, goals and outcomes that companies have when implementing the extranet are discussed as well as the factors that influence the implementation process. A multi-case study strategy was chosen where three multinational manufacturers were selected. In order to get the necessary data, people working in the purchasing areas of these companies were interviewed. As a result, we obtained that the extranet brings benefits to organizations, merely in terms of money savings. Furthermore, it was found that not all of the obtained outcomes were preset. As a final point, “people” was found to be a fundamental factor for the successful implementation <b>of</b> the <b>extranet</b> as well as arduous to deal with. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
