5|$|Although {{presented}} in two-dimensional side-scrolling format, the game retains the action-oriented approach of its predecessors, with the player controlling the character Kratos {{in the same}} combination of combat, platforming, and puzzle game elements. Platforming elements include jumping across chasms, climbing ladders, and swinging on ropes. Some puzzles require Kratos to move a box {{on top of a}} switch (thus activating it), or moving a box to <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a jumping-off point to reach a pathway unreachable with normal jumping.
