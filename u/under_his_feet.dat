First, the Sadducee explained, the Israelites should have listened, and then they should have accepted the law only if obeying the commandments was within their powers, {{but if it was}} not within their powers, they should not have accepted. Rava replied that the Israelites walked in integrity, for [...] speaks of the Jews when it says, [...] "The integrity of the upright shall guide them."

2500|$|In the Middle Ages, a hieratic {{canopy of}} state (or [...] "estate"), cloth of honour, or cloth of state was hung above {{the seat of}} a personage of {{sufficient}} standing, {{as a symbol of}} authority. The seat under such a canopy of state would normally be raised on a dais. The cloth above a seat generally continued vertically down to the ground behind the seat. [...] Emperors and kings, reigning dukes and bishops were accorded this honour. In a 15th-century manuscript illumination the sovereign Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller in Rhodes sits in state to receive a presentation copy of the author's book. His seat is raised on a carpet-covered dais and backed with a richly embroidered dosser (French, [...] "dos"). <b>Under</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> is a cushion, such as protected the feet of the King of France when he presided at a lit de justice. [...] The King of France was also covered by a mobile canopy during his Coronation, held up on poles by several Peers of France. [...] The Virgin Mary in particular, is very often shown sitting under a cloth of honour in medieval and Renaissance paintings where she is shown enthroned with saints.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the first}} 20 {{years of his}} {{photography}} Weston determined all of his exposure settings by estimation based on his previous experiences and the relatively narrow tolerances of the film at that time. He said, [...] "I dislike to figure out time, and find my exposures more accurate when only [...] "felt"." [...] In the late 1930s he acquired a Weston exposure meter and continued {{to use it as}} an aid to determine exposures throughout his career. Photo historian Nancy Newhall wrote that [...] "Young photographers are confused and amazed when they behold him measuring with his meter every value in the sphere where he intends to work, from the sky to the ground <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> He is [...] "feeling the light" [...] and checking his own observations. After which he puts the meter away and does what he thinks. Often he adds up everything ‒ filters, extension, film, speed, and so on ‒ and doubles the computation." [...] Weston, Newhall noted, believed in [...] "massive exposure", which he then compensated for by hand-processing the film in a weak developer solution and individually inspecting each negative as it continued to develop to get the right balance of highlights and shadows.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was taught}} in a Baraita that Rabbi Meir used to ask why [...] {{specified}} blue from among all the colors for the fringes. Rabbi Meir taught {{that it was because}} blue resembles the color of the sea, and the sea resembles the color of the sky, and the sky resembles the color of the Throne of Glory, as [...] says, [...] "And there was <b>under</b> <b>His</b> <b>feet</b> as it were a paved work of sapphire stone," [...] and [...] says, [...] "The likeness of a throne as the appearance of a sapphire stone." [...] (And thus, when one sees the blue thread of the fringe, it will help call to mind God.) And it was {{taught in a}} Baraita that Rabbi Meir used to say that the punishment for failing to observe the white threads of the fringes is greater than for failing to observe the blue threads. The Gemara illustrated this by a parable: A king gave orders to two servants. He asked one servant to bring a seal of clay, and he asked other to bring a seal of gold. And they both failed in their tasks. The Gemara argued that the servant deserving the greater punishment was the one whom the king directed to bring a seal of clay. (For clay is easier to get than gold. Thus the punishment for failing to get the simple white fringe should be greater than the penalty for failing to get the rare blue thread.).

50|$|Krishna then {{challenges}} him to tie all {{the leaves}} of the peepal tree under which he was standing with these arrows. Barbarika accepts the challenge and starts meditating to release his arrow by closing his eyes. Then, Krishna without the knowledge of Barbarika, plucks one of the leaf of the tree and puts it <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot.</b> When Barbarik releases his first arrow, it marks all {{the leaves of}} the tree and finally starts revolving around the leg of Krishna. For this Krishna asks Barbarika, as why was the arrow revolving around <b>his</b> <b>foot?</b> For this, Barbareek replies that there must be a leaf <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> and the arrow was targeting <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> to mark the leaf that is hidden under him. Barbarika advises Krishna to lift his leg, since, otherwise the arrow will mark the leaf by pricking Krishna's leg. Thus, Krishna lifts <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> and to <b>his</b> surprise, finds that the first arrow also marks the leaf that was hidden <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot.</b> Of course, the third arrow does collect all the leaves (including the one under Krishna's foot) and ties them together. By this Krishna concludes that the arrows are so infallible, that even if Barbarika is not aware of his targets, the arrows are so powerful that they can still navigate and trace all his intended targets. The moral of this incident is that, in a real battle field, if Krishna wants to isolate some one (for example: the 5 Pandava brothers) and hides them elsewhere in order to avoid them from being Barbarika's victim, then Krishna will not be successful as the arrows after destroying the whole army, trace the hidden targets also and destroy them. So, nobody will be able to escape from these arrows. Thus Krishna gets a deeper insight about Barbarika's phenomenal power.|$|R

2500|$|Rabbi Berekiah and Rabbi Jeremiah {{the son of}} Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba {{said that}} Rabbi Levi ben Sisi gave the {{following}} exposition at Nehardea: [...] says, [...] "And they saw the God of Israel; and there was <b>under</b> <b>His</b> <b>feet</b> the like of a brick-work of sapphire stone." [...] This was the case before they had been redeemed (from Egyptian bondage), but when they had been redeemed the brickwork was placed where the brick was generally kept (and cast away). (Before they were redeemed God had brick-work underfoot, symbolizing the bricks to which the Israelites were enslaved, for in all Israel's troubles, God suffers too. But after their redemption, the brick-work was replaced with heaven in its purity.) Rabbi Berekiah taught {{that it is not}} written in the present context, [...] "A brick-work of sapphire," [...] but [...] "The like of a brick-work of sapphire," [...] implying that both it (the Torah, symbolized by the brick) and all the implements appertaining to it were given, including the basket and the trowel appertaining to it (symbolizing the Oral Law) were given. (The expression [...] "like" [...] serves to include the object compared as well as everything resembling or connected with it.) Bar Kappara said that before the Israelites were redeemed from Egypt, the brick-work under God's feet was placed as a mark in heaven, but when the Israelites were redeemed, it was seen no more in heaven. For [...] says, [...] "And the like of the very heaven for clearness," [...] implying the sky on a clear day.|$|E
