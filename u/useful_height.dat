40|$|ALOS PRISM is {{designed}} to gather 2. 5 m resolution triplet images to obtain accurate terrain data. The PRISM triplet images {{are expected to be}} used for generating high-precision stable Digital Surface Models (DSMs). In this study, we set two purposes. The first purpose is to generate PRISM_DSMs and orthoimages and to make an accuracy assessment of them. The second purpose is the examination of the availability of PRISM_DSMs and orthoimages in forestry. As a result, the following facts were found. The divergence between a PRISM_DSM and a LIDAR_DSM can stay within the standard deviation of 10 m in the vertical direction by adopting the bias correction. The orthoimages made from a PRISM nadir image and a created PRISM_DSM can stay within the standard deviation of 5 m in the horizontal direction. The image matching correlation differs depending on the topographical condition of the object area {{and the quality of the}} PRISM_DSM is also dependent on that.

40|$|Models that assess aerosol {{effects on}} {{regional}} air quality and global climate parameterize aerosol sources {{in terms of}} amount, type, and injection height. The multiangle imaging spectroradiometer (MISR) aboard NASA's Terra satellite retrieves total column aerosol optical thickness (AOT), and aerosol type over cloud-free land and water. A stereo-matching algorithm automatically retrieves reflecting-layer altitude wherever clouds or aerosol plumes have discernable spatial contrast, with about 500 -m accuracy, at 1. 1 -km horizontal resolution. Near-source biomass burning smoke, volcanic effluent, and desert dust plumes are observed routinely, providing information about aerosol amount, particle type, and injection <b>height</b> <b>useful</b> for modeling applications. Compared to background aerosols, the plumes sampled have higher AOT, contain particles having expected differences in Angstrom exponent, size, single-scattering albedo, and for volcanic plume and dust cloud cases, particle shape. As basic thermodynamics predicts, thin aerosol plumes lifted only by regional winds or less intense heat sources are confined to the boundary layer. However, when sources have sufficient buoyancy, the representative plumes studied tend to concentrate within discrete, high-elevation layers of local stability; the aerosol is not uniformly distributed up to a peak altitude, as is sometimes assumed in modeling.

Clones were selected from the largest and smallest individuals in one 14 and one 16 year-old plantation. The 20 selected clones plus 7 other clones of interest were propagated by softwood cuttings. Gas exchange measurements, both respiration and nitrogenase activity, of intact shoots and roots were attempted. However, due to limitations of facilities and the large number of measurements required, gas exchange measurements were foregone in favor of more detailed analysis of dry weight distribution, nitrogen fixation, and carbohydrate reserves;Rooted cuttings inoculated with Frankia were grown without combined nitrogen in pots for about 3 months. During this time, nondestructive growth data and harvest data were collected. Significant clonal variation was detected in relative growth rate of leaf area, unit leaf rate, allometric coefficient between leaf and stem growth, percent starch, dry weight, and distribution of dry weight. There was little clonal or within clone variation in percent nitrogen, indicating that nitrogen fixation coincided with growth. All measured parameters varied during the course of experiments. It was difficult, therefore, to separate pure clonal differences from developmental differences. Clonal differences in rooting and establishment probably affected subsequent growth patterns. Final dry weight was the parameter best correlated with ortet field performance. Stem diameter was better correlated than plant height with dry weight, leaf area, and total nitrogen, indicating that diameter may be a more <b>useful</b> measure than <b>height.</b> Alder tree growth was episodic and total starch contents varied widely, even from day to day.

40|$|Human {{height is}} a highly {{heritable}} and complex trait but finding important genes has proven more difficult than expected. One reason might be the composite measure of height which may add heterogeneity and noise. The {{aim of this study}} was to conduct a genome-wide linkage scan to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for lengths of spine, femur, tibia, humerus and radius. These were investigated as alternative measures for height in a large, population-based twin sample with the potential to find genes underlying bone size and bone diseases. 3, 782 normal Caucasian females, 18 - 80 years old, with whole body dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) images were used. A novel and reproducible method, linear pixel count (LPC) was used to measure skeletal sizes on DXA images. Intraclass correlations and heritability estimates were calculated for lengths of spine, femur, tibia, humerus and radius on monozygotic (MZ; n = 1, 157) and dizygotic (DZ; n = 2, 594) twins. A genome-wide linkage scan was performed on 2000 DZ twin subjects. All skeletal sites excluding spine were highly correlated. Intraclass correlations showed results for MZ twins to be significantly higher than DZ twins for all traits. Heritability results were as follows: spine, 66 %; femur, 73 %; tibia, 65 %; humerus, 57 %; radius, 68 %. Results showed reliable evidence of highly suggestive linkage on chromosome 5 for spine (LOD score = 3. 0) and suggestive linkage for femur (LOD score = 2. 19) in the regions of 105 cM and 155 cM respectively.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{nucleated}} (with barrier) activation of perfectly wetting (zero contact angle) particles ranging from bulk size {{down to one}} nanometer. Thermodynamic properties of the particles, coated with liquid layers of varying thickness and surrounded by vapor, are analyzed. Nano-size particles are predicted to activate at relative humidity below the Kelvin curve on crossing a nucleation barrier, located at a critical liquid layer thickness such that the total particle size (core + liquid layer) equals the Kelvin radius (Fig. 1). This barrier vanishes precisely as the critical layer thickness approaches the thin layer limit and the Kelvin radius equals the radius of the particle itself. These considerations {{are similar to those}} included in Fletcher's theory (Fletcher, 1958) however the present analysis differs in several important respects. Firstly, where Fletcher used the classical prefactor-exponent form for the nucleation rate, requiring separate estimation of the kinetic prefactor, we solve a diffusion-drift equation that is equivalent to including the full Becker-Doering (BD) multi-state kinetics of condensation/evaporation along the growth coordinate. We also determine the mean first passage time (MFPT) for barrier crossing (Wedekind et al., 2007), which is shown to provide a generalization of BD nucleation kinetics especially <b>useful</b> for barrier <b>heights</b> that are considerably lower than those typically encountered in homogeneous vapor-liquid nucleation, and make explicit comparisons between the MFPT and BD kinetic models. Barrier heights for heterogeneous nucleation are computed by a thermo-dynamic area construction introduced recently to model deliquescence and efflorescence of small particles (McGraw and Lewis, 2009). In addition to providing a graphical representation of the activation process that offers new insights, the area construction provides a molecular approach that avoids explicit use of the interfacial tension. Typical barrier profiles for water condensation on particles of different size are shown in Fig. 2. The main emphasis of this paper lies in the computation of these barriers and barrier crossing rates by the various methods described. The present theory is especially relevant to determining the lower size limit for particle detection in condensation particle counters. Recently {{it has been shown that}} particles can take on liquid at sizes significantly smaller than predicted from the Kelvin relation in the no-barrier case (Winkler et al., 2008). This implies a detection principle based on the activated nucleation model that is the focus of the present study.

40|$|Increasing {{the power}} density of power {{electronic}} converters while reducing or maintaining the same cost, offers a higher potential {{to meet the}} current trend inrelation to various power electronic applications. High power density converters {{can be achieved by}} increasing the switching frequency, due to which the bulkiest parts, such as transformer, inductors and the capacitor's size in the convertercircuit can be drastically reduced. In this regard, highly integrated planar magnetics are considered as an effective approach compared to the conventional wire wound transformers in modern switch mode power supplies (SMPS). However, as the operating frequency of the transformers increase from several hundred kHz to MHz, numerous problems arise such as skin and proximity effects due to the induced eddy currents in the windings, leakage inductance and unbalanced magnetic flux distribution. In addition to this, the core losses whichare functional dependent on frequency gets elevated as the operating frequency increases. Therefore, this thesis provides an insight towards the problems related to the high frequency magnetics and proposes a solution with regards to different aspects in relation to designing high power density, energy efficient transformers. The first part of the thesis concentrates on the investigation of high power density and highly energy efficient coreless printed circuit board (PCB) step-down transformers <b>useful</b> for stringent <b>height</b> DC-DC converter applications, where the core losses are being completely eliminated. These transformers also maintain the advantages offered by existing core based transformers such as, high coupling coefficient, sufficient input impedance, high energy efficiency and wide frequencyband width with the assistance of a resonant technique. In this regard, several coreless PCB step down transformers of different turn’s ratio for power transfer applications have been designed and evaluated. The designed multilayered coreless PCB transformers for telecom and PoE applications of 8, 15 and 30 W show that the volume reduction of approximately 40 - 90 % is possible when compared to its existing core based counterparts while maintaining the energy efficiency of the transformers in the range of 90 - 97 %. The estimation of EMI emissions from the designed transformers for the given power transfer application proves that the amount of radiated EMI from a multilayered transformer is lessthan that of the two layered transformer because of the decreased radius for thesame amount of inductance. The design guidelines for the multilayered coreless PCB step-down transformer for the given power transfer application has been proposed. The designed transformer of 10 mm radius has been characterized up to the power level of 50 Wand possesses a record power density of 107 W/cm 3 with a peak energy efficiency of 96 %. In addition to this, the design guidelines of the signal transformer fordriving the high side MOSFET in double ended converter topologies have been proposed. The measured power consumption of the high side gate drive circuitvitogether with the designed signal transformer is 0. 37 W. Both these signal andpower transformers have been successfully implemented in a resonant converter topology in the switching frequency range of 2. 4 – 2. 75 MHz for the maximum load power of 34. 5 W resulting in the peak energy efficiency of converter as 86. 5 %. This thesis also investigates the indirect effect of the dielectric laminate on the magnetic field intensity and current density distribution in the planar power transformers with the assistance of finite element analysis (FEA). The significanceof the high frequency dielectric laminate compared to FR- 4 laminate in terms of energy efficiency of planar power transformers in MHz frequency region is also explored. The investigations were also conducted on different winding strategies such as conventional solid winding and the parallel winding strategies, which {{play an important role in}} the design and development of a high frequency transformer and suggested a better choice in the case of transformers operating in the MHz frequency region. In the second part of the thesis, a novel planar power transformer with hybrid core structure has been designed and evaluated in the MHz frequency region. The design guidelines of the energy efficient high frequency planar power transformerfor the given power transfer application have been proposed. The designed corebased planar transformer has been characterized up to the power level of 50 W and possess a power density of 47 W/cm 3 with maximum energy efficiency of 97 %. This transformer has been evaluated successfully in the resonant converter topology within the switching frequency range of 3 – 4. 5 MHz. The peak energy efficiency ofthe converter is reported to be 92 % and the converter has been tested for the maximum power level of 45 W, which is suitable for consumer applications such as laptop adapters. In addition to this, a record power density transformer has been designed with a custom made pot core and has been characterized in thefrequency range of 1 - 10 MHz. The power density of this custom core transformer operating at 6. 78 MHz frequency is 67 W/cm 3 and with the peak energy efficiency of 98 %. In conclusion, the research in this dissertation proposed a solution for obtaining high power density converters by designing the highly integrated, high frequency(1 - 10 MHz) coreless and core based planar magnetics with energy efficiencies inthe range of 92 - 97 %. This solution together with the latest semiconductor GaN/SiC switching devices provides an excellent choice to meet the requirements of the next generation ultra flat low profile switch mode power supplies (SMPS) ...|$|R
