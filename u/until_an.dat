5|$|After {{a disappointing}} year for Kinkladze, Rubin {{decided not to}} renew his contract. In January 2007, he held talks with his {{previous}} club, Anorthosis, but the transfer never materialised. In an interview in August 2007 Kinkladze's former international teammate Malkhaz Asatiani confirmed that Kinkladze had finished his career and settled in Moscow. Kinkladze later worked as a sports agent, and in August 2011 returned to his former club Anorthosis, where he was employed as Sports Director <b>until</b> <b>an</b> amicable departure in June 2012.|$|E
5|$|After re-crossing into Hamburg, NY179 {{continues}} eastward as Mile Strip Road, {{entering a}} large interchange with the New York State Thruway (I-90 exit56), which connects via trumpet interchange. After bending northeast, the route crosses over the Thruway, becoming a two-lane commercial street, passing {{north and south}} of several strip malls <b>until</b> <b>an</b> intersection with County Route204 (CR204; McKinley Parkway). After CR204, NY179 passes north of McKinley Mall, proceeding eastward as a four-lane divided boulevard past several residences before bending northeast, intersecting with CR4 (Abbott Road) in the town of Orchard Park.|$|E
5|$|Four {{cars were}} {{entered in the}} GT1 class for the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans, two by PC Automotive Jaguar and two by Chamberlain Engineering, though the latter did not run their cars. Neither team had Jaguar or TWR backing; both of PC Automotive's cars were outpaced by the new McLaren F1 GTR. Richard Piper, Tiff Needell and James Weaver were holding fourth {{position}} <b>until</b> <b>an</b> engine failure during the night, ending their race, whilst the second XJ220 retired after leaving the road.|$|E

5|$|Free-fed feral {{cats and}} house cats tend to consume many small meals {{in a single}} day, {{although}} the frequency and size of meals varies between individuals. Cats use two hunting strategies, either stalking prey actively, or waiting in ambush <b>until</b> <b>an</b> animal comes close enough to be captured. Although it is not certain, the strategy used may depend on the prey species in the area, with cats waiting in ambush outside burrows, but tending to actively stalk birds.|$|E
5|$|Green {{entered the}} School of Business as an {{economics}} major, {{and planned to}} become a certified public accountant, <b>until</b> <b>an</b> adviser told him {{that there were no}} jobs available for African-American accountants in Philadelphia.

5|$|In 1883, Knott left Congress {{and made}} a {{successful}} run for governor. He secured major reforms in education, but was stymied in his pursuit of tax reform. After his term as governor, he was a delegate to the state's constitutional convention in 1891. In 1892, he became a professor at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky and helped organized the college's law school in 1894. He served as dean {{of the law school}} <b>until</b> <b>an</b> illness forced him to retire in 1902. He died at his home in Lebanon, Kentucky on June 18, 1911.|$|E

5|$|In early 1969, Quaife {{told the}} band he was leaving.

Ray Davies pleaded with him to return for the sessions for their upcoming album, but Quaife refused. Davies immediately called up John Dalton, who had filled in for Quaife in the past, as a replacement. Dalton remained with the group until 1977, when the album Sleepwalker was released.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Cambridgeshire County Council LEA {{and the local}} Member of Parliament, Clement Freud, were {{critical}} of the education system in Wisbech. At the time, entry to the co-educational Grammar School was at age 13, meaning that at age 11, all pupils attended the comprehensive single sex Queen's Girls' and Queen's Boys' Schools <b>until</b> <b>an</b> eleven-plus-style examination was taken by all pupils. At this point, academically able pupils were moved to the selective mixed-sex grammar school, with other children staying within the two secondary modern schools.|$|E

5|$|PA371 {{continues}} eastward {{through the}} rural regions, continuing {{its way through}} Mount Pleasant Township. The highway intersects with Township Road 613, where the highway makes a hairpin turn to the south. The route continues to the southeast into a denser portion of Lebanon Township. The route continues for a distance to the east <b>until</b> <b>an</b> intersection with Lebanon Township Road 614 {{in the community of}} Cold Spring. In Cold Spring, PA371 turns to the southeast through deep forests <b>until</b> <b>an</b> intersection with Township Roads 612 and 617. There, the forests break, and the route continues to the southeast. A short distance later, PA371 intersects with PA191 (Hancock Highway) in the community of Rileyville. There, the route begins to follow the alignment of the Newburgh and Cochecton Turnpike. PA371 continues through rural farmlands until a hairpin turn in the deep forests nearby.|$|E
5|$|The Korean War {{which lasted}} from June 25, 1950, <b>until</b> <b>an</b> {{armistice}} in July 27, 1953, began when North Korea invaded South Korea.

5|$|The {{duration}} of time <b>until</b> <b>an</b> eventual reward also affects participants' choice of immediate or delayed gratification. A 2001 study demonstrated {{that if a}} reward will not be granted for an extensive amount of time, such as 180–300 months (15–25 years), the monetary amount of the reward is inconsequential; instead, {{the bulk of the}} participants choose the immediate reward, even if their delayed reward would be quite large. Delayed gratification has its limits, and a delay can only be so long before it is judged to be not worth the effort it takes to wait.|$|E

5|$|The {{position}} of the goalkeeper has existed since the game of water polo originated. At that time, {{the object of the}} game was to touch the ball on the opponent's end of the pool.
