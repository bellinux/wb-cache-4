5|$|Davis {{faced the}} most {{important}} decision of his career: to prevent reinforcement at Fort Sumter or to let it take place. He and his cabinet decided to demand that the Federal garrison surrender and, if this was refused, {{to use military force}} to prevent reinforcement before the fleet arrived. Major Anderson did not surrender. With Jefferson Davis's endorsement, Beauregard began the bombarding of the fort in the early dawn of April 12. The Confederates continued their artillery attack on Fort Sumter until it surrendered on April 14. No one was killed in the artillery duel, but the attack on the U.S. fortress meant the fighting had started. President Lincoln called <b>up</b> <b>state</b> militia to march south to recapture Federal property. In the North and South, massive rallies were held to demand immediate war.

40|$|The neocortex generates short epochs of {{persistent}} activity called <b>up</b> <b>states,</b> which {{are associated with}} changes in cellular and network excitability. Using somatosensory thalamocortical slices, we studied the impact {{of persistent}} cortical activity during spontaneous <b>up</b> <b>states</b> on intrinsic cellular excitability (input resistance) and on excitatory synaptic inputs of cortical cells. At the intrinsic excitability level, {{we found that the}} expected decrease in input resistance (high conductance) resulting from synaptic barrages during <b>up</b> <b>states</b> is counteracted by an increase in input resistance due to depolarization per se. The result is a variable but on average relatively small reduction in input resistance during <b>up</b> <b>states.</b> At the synaptic level, <b>up</b> <b>states</b> enhanced a late synaptic component of short-latency thalamocortical field potential responses but suppressed intracortical field potential responses. The thalamocortical enhancement did not reflect an increase in synaptic strength, as determined by measuring the evoked postsynaptic current, but instead an increase in evoked action potential (spike) probability due to depolarization during <b>up</b> <b>states.</b> In contrast, the intracortical suppression was associated with a reduction in synaptic strength, apparently driven by increased presynaptic intracortical activity during <b>up</b> <b>states.</b> In addition, intracortical suppression also reflected a reduction in evoked spike latency caused by depolarization and the abolishment of longer-latency spikes caused by stronger inhibitory drive during <b>up</b> <b>states.</b> In conclusion, depolarization during <b>up</b> <b>states</b> increases the success of excitatory synaptic inputs to reach firing. However, activity-dependent synaptic depression caused by increased presynaptic firing during <b>up</b> <b>states</b> and the enhancement of evoked inhibitory drive caused by depolarization suppress excitatory intracortical synaptic inputs...|$|R

40|$|During {{sleep and}} anesthesia, neocortical neurons exhibit rhythmic UP/DOWN {{membrane}} potential <b>states.</b> Although <b>UP</b> <b>states</b> are maintained by synaptic activity, the mechanisms {{that underlie the}} initiation and robust rhythmicity of <b>UP</b> <b>states</b> are unknown. Using a physiologically validated model of UP/DOWN state generation in mouse neocortical slices whereby the cholinergic tone present in vivo is reinstated, we show that the regular initiation of <b>UP</b> <b>states</b> is driven by an electrophysiologically distinct subset of morphologically identified layer 5 neurons, which exhibit intrinsic rhythmic low-frequency burst firing at 0. 2 – 2 Hz. This low-frequency bursting is resistant to block of glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission but is absent when slices are maintained in a low Ca 2 medium (an alternative, widely used model of cortical UP/DOWN states), thus explaining the lack of rhythmic <b>UP</b> <b>states</b> and abnormally prolonged DOWN states in this condition. We also characterized the activity of various other pyramidal and nonpyramidal neurons during UP/ DOWN states andfoundthat an electrophysiologically distinct subset of layer 5 regular spiking pyramidal neuronsfires earlier duringthe onset of network oscillations compared with all other types of neurons recorded. This study, therefore, identifies an important role for cell-type-specific neuronal activity in driving neocortical <b>UP</b> <b>states...</b>|$|R
40|$|During {{cortical}} network activity, recurrent synaptic excitation among pyramidal neurons is approximately balanced by synaptic inhibition, which {{is provided by}} a vast diversity of inhibitory interneurons. The relative contributions of different interneuron subtypes to inhibitory tone during {{cortical network}} activity is not well understood. We previously showed {{that many of the}} major interneuron subtypes in mouse barrel cortex are highly active during <b>Up</b> <b>states</b> (Neske et al., 2015); while fast-spiking (FS), parvalbumin (PV) -positive cells were the most active interneuron subtype, many non-fast-spiking (NFS), PV-negative interneurons were as active or more active than neighboring pyramidal cells. This suggests that the NFS cells could play a role in maintaining or modulating <b>Up</b> <b>states.</b> Here, using optogenetic techniques, we further dissected the functional roles during <b>Up</b> <b>states</b> of two major NFS, PV-negative interneuron subtypes: somatostatin (SOM) -positive cells and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) -positive cells. We found that while pyramidal cell excitability during <b>Up</b> <b>states</b> significantly increased when SOM cells were optogenetically silenced, VIP cells did not influence pyramidal cell excitability either upon optogenetic silencing or activation. VIP cells failed to contribute to <b>Up</b> <b>states</b> despite their ability to inhibit SOM cells strongly.

40|$|To {{test whether}} humans can encode words during sleep we played {{everyday}} words to men {{while they were}} napping and assessed priming from sleep played words following waking. Words were presented during non rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Priming was assessed using a semantic and a perceptual priming test. These tests measured differences in the proces sing of words that had been or had not been played during sleep. Synonyms to sleep played words were the targets in the semantic priming test that tapped the meaning of sleep played words. All men responded to sleep played words by producing <b>up</b> <b>states</b> in their electroencephalogram. <b>Up</b> <b>states</b> are NREM sleep specific phases of briefly increased neuronal excitability. The word evoked <b>up</b> <b>states</b> might have promoted word processing during sleep. Yet, the mean performance in the priming tests administered following sleep was at chance level, which suggests that participants as a group failed to show priming following sleep. However, performance in the two priming tests was positively correlated {{to each other and}} to the magnitude of the word evoked <b>up</b> <b>states.</b> Hence, the larger a participant’s word evoked <b>up</b> <b>states,</b> the larger his perceptual and semantic priming. Those participants who scored high on all variables must have encoded words during sleep. We conclude that some humans are able to encode words during sleep, but more research is needed to pin down the factors that modulate this ability...|$|R
40|$|During sleep, neocortical {{neuronal}} networks oscillate slowly (< 1 Hz) between periods of activity (<b>UP</b> <b>states)</b> and silence (DOWN <b>states).</b> <b>UP</b> <b>states</b> favor {{the interaction between}} thalamic-generated spindles (7 – 14 Hz) and cortically generated gamma (30 – 80 Hz) waves. We studied how these three nested oscillations modulate fast-spiking interneuron (FSi) activity in vivo in VGAT-Venus transgenic rats. Our data describe a population of FSi that discharge “early” within <b>UP</b> <b>states</b> and another population that discharge “late. ” Early FSi tended to be silent during epochs of desynchronization, whereas late FSi were active. We hypothesize that late FSi {{may be responsible for}} generating the gamma oscillations associated with cognitive processing during wakefulness. Remarkably, FSi populations were differently modulated by spindle and gamma rhythms. Early FSi were robustly coupled to spindles and always discharged earlier than late FSi within spindle and gamma cycles. The preferred firing phase during spindle and gamma waves was strongly correlated in each cell, suggesting a cross-frequency coupling between oscillations. Our results suggest a precise spatiotemporal pattern of FSi activity during <b>UP</b> <b>states,</b> whereby information rapidly flows between early and late cells, initially promoted by spindles and efficiently extended by local gamma oscillations...|$|R

40|$|Spontaneous {{activity}} is commonly {{observed in a}} variety of cortical states. Experimental evidence suggested that neural assemblies undergo slow oscillations with <b>Up</b> ad Down <b>states</b> even when the network is isolated {{from the rest of the}} brain. Here we show that these spontaneous events can be generated by the recurrent connections within the network and understood as signatures of neural circuits that are correcting their internal representation. A noiseless spiking neural network can represent its input signals most accurately when excitatory and inhibitory currents are as strong and as tightly balanced as possible. However, in the presence of realistic neural noise and synaptic delays, this may result in prohibitively large spike counts. An optimal working regime can be found by considering terms that control firing rates in the objective function from which the network is derived and then minimizing simultaneously the coding error and the cost of neural activity. In biological terms, this is equivalent to tuning neural thresholds and after-spike hyperpolarization. In suboptimal working regimes, we observe spontaneous activity even in the absence of feed-forward inputs. In an all-to-all randomly connected network, the entire population is involved in <b>Up</b> <b>states.</b> In spatially organized networks with local connectivity, <b>Up</b> <b>states</b> spread through local connections between neurons of similar selectivity and take the form of a traveling wave. <b>Up</b> <b>states</b> are observed for a wide range of parameters and have similar statistical properties in both active and quiescent state. In the optimal working regime, <b>Up</b> <b>states</b> are vanishing, leaving place to asynchronous activity, suggesting that this working regime is a signature of maximally efficient coding. Although they result in a massive increase in the firing activity, the read-out of spontaneous <b>Up</b> <b>states</b> is in fact orthogonal to the stimulus representation, therefore interfering minimally with the network function...|$|R

40|$|During NREM {{sleep and}} under {{certain types of}} anaesthesia, the {{mammalian}} brain exhibits a distinctive slow (< 1  Hz) rhythm. At the cellular level, this rhythm correlates with so-called UP and DOWN membrane potential states. In the neocortex, these <b>UP</b> and DOWN <b>states</b> correspond to periods of intense network activity and widespread neuronal silence, respectively, whereas in thalamocortical (TC) neurons, UP/DOWN states take on a more stereotypical oscillatory form, with <b>UP</b> <b>states</b> commencing with a low-threshold Ca 2 + potential (LTCP). Whilst these properties are now well recognised for neurons in cats and rats, {{whether or not they}} are also shared by neurons in the mouse is not fully known. To address this issue, we obtained intracellular recordings from neocortical and TC neurons during the slow (< 1  Hz) rhythm in anaesthetised mice. We show that UP/DOWN states in this species are broadly similar to those observed in cats and rats, with <b>UP</b> <b>states</b> in neocortical neurons being characterised by a combination of action potential output and intense synaptic activity, whereas <b>UP</b> <b>states</b> in TC neurons always commence with an LTCP. In some neocortical and TC neurons, we observed ‘spikelets’ during <b>UP</b> <b>states,</b> supporting the possible presence of electrical coupling. Lastly, we show that, upon tonic depolarisation, UP/DOWN states in TC neurons are replaced by rhythmic high-threshold bursting at ~ 5  Hz, as predicted by in vitro studies.
