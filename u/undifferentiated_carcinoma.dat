40|$|Abstract. Background: Insulin-like growth-factor 1 {{receptor}} (IGF- 1 R) plays a {{key role}} in the development of cancer and is important for the regulation of tissue growth, predominantly via the growth hormone (GH). Targeting IGF- 1 R is a current topic of cancer research. The aim of this study was to identify IGF- 1 R in <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>carcinomas</b> of the head and neck. Patients and Methods: Twenty-one formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded specimens from 20 patients with <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>carcinomas</b> were investigated. IGF- 1 R was detected immunohistochemically. In some cases, the infection status for Einstein Barr virus (EBV, DNA) or HPV (RNA) was known. Results: IGF- 1 R was detected in all tumours, regardless of differentiation or proof of EBV or HPV integration into the genome.

40|$|Frozen {{sections}} of 48 squamous cell <b>carcinomas</b> and seven <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>carcinomas</b> {{of the upper}} aerodigestive tract were investigated immunohistochemically with monoclonal antibodies specific for keratin, vimentin, desmin, neurofilaments, and glial fibrillary acidic proteins. In nine squamous cell carcinomas (19 %) and six <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (86 %) obtained before treatment coexpression of keratin and vimentin was detected in some tumor cells by double immunofluorescence studies. Nine squamous cell carcinomas expressed neurofilaments in scattered tumor cells. Coexpression of vimentin or neurofilaments was seen especially in the peripheral cell layer of the tumor nests and {{did not seem to}} correlate with the degree of differentiation. Three <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>carcinomas</b> additionally expressed desmin, and one tumor contained neurofilaments. Glial fibrillary acidic proteins were not detected. Increased coexpression of keratin with vimentin, desmin, or neurofilaments was seen in some tumors that were studied before and after radiation/chemotherapy, suggesting that the intermediate filament profile of tumor cells can be altered by external influences...|$|R
50|$|Around 20% of parotid {{tumors are}} malignant, {{with the most}} common tumors being mucoepidermoid {{carcinoma}} and adenoid cystic carcinoma. Other malignant tumors of the parotid gland include acinic cell carcinoma, carcinoma expleomorphic adenoma, adenocarcinoma (arising from ductal epithelium of parotid gland), squamous cell carcinoma (arising from parenchyma of parotid gland), and <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>carcinoma.</b> Metastasis from other sites like phyllodes tumour of breast presenting as parotid swelling have also been described.

5000|$|Nasopharyngeal carcinoma, {{commonly}} known as nasopharyngeal cancer, is classified as a malignant neoplasm, or cancer, arising from the mucosal epithelium of the nasopharynx, most often within the lateral nasopharyngeal recess or fossa of Rosenmüller (a recess behind {{the entrance of the}} eustachian tube opening). The World Health Organization classifies nasopharyngeal carcinoma in three types. Type 1 (I) is keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. Type 2a (II) is non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. Type 2b (III) is <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>carcinoma.</b> Type 2b (III) nonkeratinizing undifferentiated form also known as lymphoepithelioma is most common, and is most strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection of the cancerous cells.|$|E

40|$|Background: Immunohistochemical {{expression}} of the transcription factor Pax- 8 in human thyroid diseases has never been investigated. The relationship between Pax- 8, bcl- 2 and p 53 in thyroid neoplasms is also matter of interest. Materials and Methods: Seventhy-three thyroid tissue samples were evaluated for the {{expression of}} Pax- 8, p 53 and bcl- 2 using the immunoperoxidase technique. The series included 11 follicular adenomas, 11 goitres, 23 papillary carcinomas, 16 follicular <b>carcinomas,</b> 6 <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>carcinomas</b> and 6 medullary carcinomas. Results: The percentage of Pax- 8 positive cells ranged from 14. 9 to 27. 1 % and 10. 1 to 39 % in goitres and follicular adenomas, respectively. Among differentiated carcinomas, follicular histotype showed a Pax- 8 immunoreactivity ranging from 0 to 26. 5 % of the neoplastic cells whereas in papillary carcinomas the percentage of positive cells ranged from 0 to 16. 8 %. None out of the six <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>carcinomas</b> showed Pax- 8 immunoreactivity. The same negative pattern was noticed in medullary carcinomas. A statistically significant difference in Pax- 8 expression was observed between non-malignant and malignant diseases (p < 0. 0001). A different reactivity for Pax- 8 was also noticed between differentiated <b>carcinomas</b> and <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (p = 0. 07). None of the benign tissues stained for p 53 whereas among malignant specimens different percentages of p 53 expression were observed with all <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>carcinomas</b> expressing the highest positivity (range 24. 1 - 88. 6 %). Finally, when a combined analysis of bcl- 2 and Pax- 8 reactivity was carried out, some carcinomas proved to be Pax- 8 negative and bcl- 2 positive whereas others showed a similar immunoreactive pattern for both Pax- 8 and bcl- 2. Conclusions: Pax- 8 is mainly expressed in benign rather than in malignant thyroid diseases and, among neoplasms, differentiated carcinomas express Pax- 8 more frequently than <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> An inverse pattern was observed for p 53. Bcl- 2 seems to be partially related to Pax- 8 expression. However, a Pax- 8 independent bcl- 2 expression is also evident...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} 55 {{randomly}} chosen radical prostatectomy specimens was analyzed for expression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) by immunohistochemical techniques. Tissue sections were selected {{in such a}} manner that in addition to glandular benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), one or more different prostatic tumour growth patterns were present. Four monoclonal antibodies, directed against three different PSA epitopes, and one polyclonal anti-PSA antiserum were used. Expression of PSA was compared with that of prostate-specific acid phosphatase (PAP), recognized by two different polyclonal antisera. A critical dilution aimed at a maximum of staining intensity on BPH tissue sections was chosen for all antibodies. Anti-PSA and anti-PAP antisera stained essentially all BPH samples (over 90 %). Irrespective {{of the nature of the}} antibodies used, PSA expression was found to be decreased in prostatic carcinoma. A clear cut relationship was found between immunoreactivity for PSA and the degree of differentiation of the tumour area. Under the experimental conditions used the PSA monoclonal antibodies stained only 1 out of 10 <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> whereas 50 % to 70 % of the well- and moderately-differentiated carcinomas showed immunoreactivity. This correlation was less pronounced with the PAP staining pattern. If the PSA antibody titer was raised the percentage of clearly staining <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>carcinomas</b> could be considerably increased (up to 60 %- 100 %), indicating that PSA expression is not absent, but lowered in most (if not all) <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>carcinomas...</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>Undifferentiated</b> <b>carcinomas</b> {{are rare}} types of esophageal tumors. These tumors have been {{reported}} to have aggressive biological behavior and poor prognosis; however, sarcomatoid has been shown to have a better prognosis than SCC of the esophagus, with an overall survival rate of 50 % for sarcomatoid carcinomas compared with 3 - and 5 -year survival rates of 29.8 % and 15 %, respectively, for SCC [24]. <b>Undifferentiated</b> <b>carcinomas</b> should be subclassified since the prognosis could be different among the different types. Classical round cell carcinomas, including neuroendocrine carcinoma and carcinoma with rhabdoid features, reportedly have a poor prognosis. Considering the preoperative diagnosis of advanced undifferentiated lower esophageal cancer, we feared the possibility of a more aggressive lymphatic permeation or a more extensive lymph node metastases than that observed in ordinal esophageal cancer, and we did not perform a proximal gastrectomy but rather performed a total gastrectomy with lower esophageal resection and lymph node dissection without evidence of positivity.|$|R

40|$|Context Undifferentiated (anaplastic) {{carcinoma}} of the pancreas with osteoclast-like giant cells is exceedingly rare. The prognosis of <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>carcinoma</b> is worse than that of poorly differentiated ductal adeno{{carcinoma of}} the pancreas; however, <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>carcinoma</b> with osteoclast-like giant cells might have a more favorable prognosis. Case report We report the case of <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>carcinoma</b> of the pancreas with osteoclast-like giant cells, showing an intraductal growth pattern with various degree of pancreas duct involvement in the different areas. As a result, {{we were able to}} demonstrate the entire spectrum of changes, ranging from the early, minimal intraluminal growth to the partial or complete occlusion of the branches of the main pancreatic duct, and finally invasion and formation of the large necrotic/degenerated cysts. Conclusions Our findings support the epithelial origin of <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>carcinoma</b> of the pancreas with osteoclast-like giant cells. In early stages, the affected pancreatic duct epithelium was intermingled with nonepithelial component and had an immunoprofile distinctive from the epithelial lining of the uninvolved (normal) pancreatic ducts.

40|$|Homeobox {{genes are}} {{involved}} in neoplastic transformation of both epithelial and hemopoietic tissues. The divergent homeobox gene HEX is expressed in the anterior visceral endoderm during early mouse development and in some adult tissues of endodermal origin, including liver and thyroid.

Herein, we analyzed HEX expression and subcellular localization in a series of 55 human thyroid tumors and in several tumoral cell lines. HEX mRNA was detected by RT-PCR either in normal tissues or in thyroid adenomas and differentiated (papillary and follicular) carcinomas. HEX mRNA was also expressed in most <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> Subcellular localization of HEX protein was investigated by immunohistochemistry. In normal tissues and adenomas, HEX protein was present both in nucleus and cytoplasm. In contrast, both differentiated and <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> as well as the tumoral cell lines investigated, showed HEX protein only in the cytoplasm.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Thyroid carcinomas {{represent}} {{the most frequent}} endocrine malignancies. Recent studies were able to distinguish malignant from benign nodules of the thyroid gland with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Although this differentiation is undoubtedly helpful, presurgical discrimination between well-differentiated and <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>carcinomas</b> would be crucial to define the optimal treatment algorithm. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate if readout-segmented multishot echo planar DWI is able to differentiate between differentiated and undifferentiated subtypes of thyroid carcinomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with different types of thyroid carcinomas who received preoperative DWI were included in our study. In all lesions, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) min, ADCmean, ADCmax, and D were estimated on the basis of region of interest measurements after coregistration with T 1 -weighted, postcontrast images. All tumors were resected and analyzed histopathologically. Ki- 67 index, p 53 synthesis, cellularity, and total and average nucleic areas were estimated using ImageJ version 1. 48. RESULTS: Analysis of variance revealed a statistically significant difference in ADCmean values between differentiated and <b>undifferentiated</b> thyroid <b>carcinomas</b> (P = . 022). Spearman Rho calculation identified significant correlations between ADCmax and cell count (r =  0. 541, P = . 046) as well as between ADCmax and total nuclei area (r =  0. 605, P = . 022).
