50|$|Although {{it is not}} to {{be found}} in most legal dictionaries, it has been used by some {{scholars}} such as Sri Lankan Lakshman Marasinghe.

5000|$|The Amadios, {{whose son}} carried on {{business}} as a builder, guaranteed the son's indebtedness to the Commercial Bank of Australia. To this end, they executed certain documents the effect of which was to provide the bank with a mortgage over a building which they owned.

They were held {{to be at a}} [...] "special disadvantage" [...] as an equitable doctrine in Equity (law). With <b>unconscionable</b> <b>conduct</b> having no definition at a legislative level (other than conduct lacking in goodfaith) it is largely up to the presiding judicial member to determine as to whether compliance is efficient on a statutory basis.|$|E

There is a need for detriment, and noted the judge focused on Mr Gillett being underpaid.|$|E

Both the equitable doctrine of unconscionability and the regulation of <b>unconscionable</b> <b>conduct</b> under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) with its Australian Consumer Law are considered. Account is also taken of case law relating to how <b>unconscionable</b> <b>conduct</b> was regulated under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). The article highlights that, while the regulation of <b>unconscionable</b> <b>conduct</b> has great potential to benefit and protect ecommerce consumers, it has not really been utilised so far. Further, our key areas of concern for the unconscionability regulation of consumer ecommerce are identified and discussed. Finally, a few speculations as to the future role of unconscionability regulation for consumer ecommerce are presented...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{application}} of the provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Commonwealth) particularly section 51 AC (<b>unconscionable</b> <b>conduct</b> in business transactions) to commercial leases. The Trade Practices Act 1974 (Commonwealth) will also be referred to in this paper as the TPA. In the past few years, there have been increasingly significant concerns from small retailers over <b>unconscionable</b> <b>conduct</b> concerning retail leasing transactions whereby the courts have had to take a more active approach in protecting retail tenancies. For example, in the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leelee Pty Ltd 1, illustrates where section 51 AC(3) (b) may be used.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{interprets the}} meaning and application of the concept <b>unconscionable</b> <b>conduct</b> {{as well as the}} factors that constitute unconscionability, contained in section 40 (1) of the Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 (CPA), by comparing consumer laws and definitions from different countries with South Africa. This dissertation illustrates that the generic term <b>unconscionable</b> <b>conduct</b> is not well known in South Africa, despite the provision thereof in the CPA. There is consequently uncertainty regarding this concept and it is therefore necessary to include a more in depth definition and explanation. The dissertation furthermore attempts to establish concrete definitions for the unconscionability factors such as, physical force against a consumer, coercion, undue influence, pressure, duress or harassment and unfair tactics. These factors are not defined anywhere in the CPA and well-constructed definitions will reduce uncertainty and interpretation problems Two conclusions can be drawn from this dissertation: Firstly, that the concept of <b>unconscionable</b> <b>conduct</b> must be expanded, improved and explained. This will ensure that all suppliers know the consequences of unconscionability and that the consumer can have the peace of mind to know they will be protected under all circumstances. Secondly, that the CPA must be improved with regards to the factors of unconscionability. By removing unnecessary factors and providing concrete definitions to the remaining factors will ensure that the entire concept is easier to understand and apply.

There are a large number of cases which deal with a financier’s general obligationsmto explain documents for example. I will also deal with some of these obligations. Further, there is a tendency to regard s 52 prohibiting misleading or deceptive conduct as a type of Rosetta stone in the area and not adequately to consider the development of the common law in relation to <b>unconscionable</b> <b>conduct,</b> breach of contract and negligence.

40|$|Those {{who follow}} {{developments}} in the law relating to guarantees have been confronted in recent times with an ever increasing array of statutory provisions designed to deal with <b>unconscionable</b> <b>conduct.</b> It seems that allegations of <b>unconscionable</b> <b>conduct,</b> in its various forms, {{on the part of}} the creditor have become part of the standard defence of those guarantors seeking to set aside the guarantee. It may not be too far fetched to suggest that the enactment of a raft of unconscionability provisions across a range of statutes at both state and federal levels has left many perplexed. Many of the provisions are similar, but not identical. This article examines the scope and application of overlapping provisions in the ASIC Act and TPA which govern unconscionability with respect to financial services and considers their role in relation to contracts of guarantee. It further considers what role the regulator, ASIC, has to play in setting normative standards in a systemic way for banks and financiers when taking guarantees...|$|E
40|$|<b>Unconscionable</b> <b>conduct</b> is well {{recognised}} in Singaporean and Australian jurisdictions as {{a ground}} for restraining the beneficiary calling under an on-demand guarantee. An on-demand guarantee {{is provided by}} an issuer to guarantee that the applicant will meet obligations owed to the beneficiary. When the applicant fails to perform the amount becomes payable by the issuer on demand of the beneficiary. The objective {{of this article is to}} examine the meaning of <b>unconscionable</b> <b>conduct</b> in the context of on-demand guarantees. This article examines the equitable doctrines potentially encapsulated in the relevant unconscionability provisions under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) sch 2 and underlying judge-made law, and their relevance to on-demand guarantees. This article argues that only certain categories of unconscionability in equity jurisprudence are appropriate to describe unconscionable demands under on-demand guarantees. Drawing on the theory of exploitation it also argues that unconscionable demands under on-demand guarantees are a case of wrongful exploitation that calls for judicial intervention.

40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis is strongly linked to unsuitable subprime loans or non-confirming loans {{that have been}} provided by various organisations, and subsequently high levels of defaults have occurred and continue to occur. It is therefore {{important to understand the}} characteristics and evolution of subprime lending to determine its potential basis for <b>unconscionable</b> <b>conduct</b> actions. There are three main purposes of this article. Firstly, the article provides an Australian perspective on the current {{global financial}} crisis, in an attempt to separate fact from fiction. The focus of this article is on the Australian experience of the subprime crisis, not the US situation. It is disturbing to note that a number of publications have not understood these differences, and have attempted to apply the US situation to Australian experiences. The application of US experiences to Australia is misleading, and any resulting principles or views are of questionable value. For this reason, it is critical that there be further research into the situation from an Australian perspective. Secondly, the article examines the potential causes of action available to victims of unconscionable subprime loans, focusing specifically on the doctrine of <b>unconscionable</b> <b>conduct.</b> This involves an analysis of the development of the <b>unconscionable</b> <b>conduct</b> regime, with a focus on the tests for special disadvantage and situational disadvantage. This concept has a strong association with the provision of exploitative subprime loans, and this connection should be explored further in light of the drastic consequences of inappropriate subprime loans. Thirdly, the article provides a critique of the recent legislative reforms in the areas of consumer credit and financial services. This section also makes suggestions for law reform to adequately respond to the challenges posed by the global financial crisis and the victims of inappropriate subprime lending. No Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|A bank {{extended}} {{credit to}} a company, taking security as it proceeded. The circumstances were unexceptionable. Nonetheless, {{the trial judge}} found that the bank had engaged in <b>unconscionable</b> <b>conduct</b> {{within the meaning of}} the general law, and had exercised economic duress. These findings were reversed on appeal. This article examines this decision – Australia and New Zealand Banking Group v Karam (2005) 64 NSWLR 149; [2006] ATPR 42 - 089 – and canvasses the scope of these doctrines, and examines a core issue: the extent to which economic pressure can ground a remedy in reliance upon these doctrines. This decision and the antecedent decision of the High Court in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd (2003) 214 CLR 51 clarify the obligations on banks, commercial lessors and other service providers conventionally considered to have market power when dealing with small businesses and individuals. The decision in ANZ v Karam is also directly relevant to the interpretation of the <b>unconscionable</b> <b>conduct</b> provisions in the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) which import the general law doctrine of unconscionability. 9 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Sri Lankan law, in strict {{conformity}} with English common law principles, recognises limited scope for judicial {{intervention in the}} enforcement of demand guarantees. Fraud as recognised in common law, provides the basis for restraining the beneficiary calling under the guarantee; both Sri Lankan and English courts have not yet recognised equitable intervention strategies to provide relief against <b>unconscionable</b> <b>conduct</b> {{on the part of}} the beneficiary seeking the enforcement of a demand guarantee. This article critically examines the commercial utility of demand guarantees and the need to safeguard the reputation and international standing of financial institutions as the key rationales contributing to the narrow scope of judicial intervention in Sri Lanka. This article argues that these rationales should not stand in circumstances where the beneficiary's conduct calling under the guarantee falls short of fraud but is clearly unconscionable. It also argues that equitable intervention to provide relief against <b>unconscionable</b> <b>conduct</b> in the enforcement of demand guarantees is a significant step towards regulation of unfair trade practices. If regulation does not occur unfair trading practices may promote lower volume, lead to trading declines and depress activity in the guarantee market.
