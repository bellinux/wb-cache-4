60|$|And, verily, {{without the}} {{consciousness}} of a principle of immortality in the human soul, Man could never have had awakened in him the desire {{to live in the}} remembrance of his fellows: mere love, or the yearning of kind towards kind, could not have produced it. The dog or horse perishes in the field, or in the stall, by the side of his companions, and is incapable of anticipating the sorrow with which his surrounding associates shall bemoan his death, or pine for his loss; he cannot pre-conceive this regret, he can form no thought of it; and therefore cannot possibly have a desire to leave such regret or remembrance behind him. Add to the principle of love which exists in the inferior animals, the faculty of reason which exists in Man alone; will the conjunction of these account for the desire? Doubtless it is a necessary consequence of this conjunction; yet not I think as a direct result, but only to be come at through an intermediate thought, viz. that of an intimation or assurance within us, that some part of our nature is imperishable. At least the precedence, in order of birth, of one feeling to the other, is unquestionable. If we look back upon the days of childhood, we shall find that the time is not in remembrance when, with respect to our own individual Being, the mind was without this assurance; whereas, the wish to be remembered by our friends or kindred after death, or even in absence, is, as we shall discover, a sensation that does not form itself till the social feelings have been developed, and the Reason has connected itself {{with a wide range of}} objects. Forlorn, and cut off from communication with the best part of his nature, must that man be, who should derive the sense of immortality, as it exists in the mind of a child, from the same unthinking gaiety or liveliness of animal spirits with which the lamb in the meadow, or any other irrational creature is endowed; who should ascribe it, in short, to blank ignorance in the child; to an inability arising from the imperfect state of his faculties to come, in any point of his being, into contact with a notion of death; or to an unreflecting acquiescence in what had been instilled into him! Has such an <b>unfolder</b> of the mysteries of nature, though he may have forgotten his former self, ever noticed the early, obstinate, and unappeasable inquisitiveness of children upon the subject of origination? This single fact proves outwardly the monstrousness of those suppositions: for, if we had no direct external testimony that the minds of very young children meditate feelingly upon death and immortality, these inquiries, which we all know they are perpetually making concerning the whence, do necessarily include correspondent habits of interrogation concerning the whither. Origin and tendency are notions inseparably co-relative. Never did a child stand by the side of a running stream, pondering within himself what power was the feeder of the perpetual current, from what never-wearied sources the body of water was supplied, but he must have been inevitably propelled to follow this question by another: 'Towards what abyss is it in progress? what receptacle can contain the mighty influx?' And the spirit of the answer must have been, though the word might be sea or ocean, accompanied perhaps with an image gathered from a map, or from the real object in nature--these might have been the letter, but the spirit of the answer must have been as inevitably,--a receptacle without bounds or dimensions;--nothing less than infinity. We may, then, be justified in asserting, that the sense of immortality, if not a co-existent and twin birth with Reason, is among the earliest of her offspring: and we may further assert, that from these conjoined, and under their countenance, the human affections are gradually formed and opened out. This is not the place to enter into the recesses of these investigations; but the subject requires me here to make a plain avowal, that, for my own part, it is to me inconceivable, that the sympathies of love towards each other, which grow with our growth, could ever attain any new strength, or even preserve the old, after we had received from the outward senses the impression of death, and were in the habit of having that impression daily renewed and its accompanying feeling brought home to ourselves, and to those we love; if the same were not counteracted by those communications with our internal Being, which are anterior to all these experiences, and with which revelation coincides, and has through that coincidence alone (for otherwise it could not possess it) a power to affect us. I confess, with me the conviction is absolute, that, if the impression and sense of death were not thus counterbalanced, such a hollowness would pervade the whole system of things, such a want of correspondence and consistency, a disproportion so astounding betwixt means and ends, that there could be no repose, no joy. Were we to grow up unfostered by this genial warmth, a frost would chill the spirit, so penetrating and powerful, that there could be no motions of the life of love; and infinitely less could we have any wish to be remembered after we had passed away from a world in which each man had moved about like a shadow.--If, then, in a creature endowed with the faculties of foresight and reason, the social affections could not have unfolded themselves uncountenanced by the faith that Man is an immortal being; and if, consequently, neither could the individual dying have had a desire to survive in the remembrance of his fellows, nor on their side could they have felt a wish to preserve for future times vestiges of the departed; it follows, as a final inference, that without the belief in immortality, wherein these several desires originate, neither monuments nor epitaphs, in affectionate or laudatory commemoration of the deceased, could have existed in the world.|$|E

40|$|Battery charger {{and motor}} drive {{are two major}} {{components}} of an electric vehicle (EV) that utilize power electronic technologies. An important design criterion in charger design is its power handling capability. Higher power is desirable as an empty-to-full charge can be completed in shorter amount of time. Off-vehicle chargers typically offer higher power-ratings than on-vehicle ac-dc chargers, but their accessibility can be limited. To overcome this, one can design more powerful on-vehicle chargers. However, this approach adds to EV 2 ̆ 7 s cost and weight and is not always preferred. In research years, there has been active research in the integration of on-vehicle charger and motor drive. This approach exploits the drive 2 ̆ 7 s power-bidirectional capability {{and the fact that}} charging activities usually occur in a parked vehicle when the motor is inactive. Most of the published methods are based on and preserve the popular pulse-width modulated voltage-source inverter with little to no power-stage changes. In charger mode, the inverter is disconnected from the motor and then connected to the ac source. From a system perspective, this method eliminates the need of a separate on-vehicle charger unit. The main disadvantage is the need of a dc-dc converter between the battery and inverter to optimize the combined efficiency of inverter/motor and to provide galvanic isolation for safety. This work presents a novel integrated charger/drive system using a low-frequency three-phase unfolding circuit (<b>Unfolder)</b> and two series-resonant converters (SRC). The <b>Unfolder</b> offers improved efficiency over a similarly-rated inverter due to lower switching-loss. The charger operation of the proposed system has previously been demonstrated in unity power factor ac-dc rectification.

40|$|It is {{a common}} {{conjecture}} that all convex polyhedra must be edge-unfoldable but to date a valid proof of this has escaped discovery. This dissertation presents several new directions {{in the quest for}} the proof. Also discussed is a method which may lead to a counterexample to the conjecture through the construction of ‘hard to unfold’ polyhedra. Algorithmic solutions are discussed for the task of determining the specific set of edges which must be cut in order that an unfolding not self-intersect. A series of <b>Unfolder</b> algorithms are explored and compared, in terms of both algorithmic design and empirical performance on test data. No surface of uniformly negative internal curvature with fewer than two border curves is unfoldable. The coolinoids are a class of non-convex polyhedra having exactly two border curves and negative curvature at every internal vertex, which may be constructed so as to be unfoldable without overlap. The fascinating interaction between construction and overlap in coolinoids is modelled and explored. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Summary. Mobility is {{a central}} feature of many {{distributed}} systems of ever growing complexity. To make their formal analysis and verification feasible, process algebras — notably the π-calculus — have been introduced and extensively studied. A well-established method of verifying the correctness of general distributed systems has been model-checking which is completely automatic and relatively fast compared to other alternatives, and so particularly attractive in industrial context. Mobile systems are highly concurrent causing state space explosion when applying model-checking techniques. To cope with this problem, techniques based on partial order semantics of concurrency seem to offer the desired level of efficiency. The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate how one of such techniques — based of unfoldings of high-level Petri nets — could be used for verification of π-calculus terms. Our starting point was an existing compositional translation from a finite fragment of the π-calculus into a class of high-level Petri nets. We developed a prototype tool based on this theoretical translation and an existing efficient <b>unfolder</b> and verifier. In this paper, we describe initial experimental results in support of specific design choices. Crucially, developing the prototype was not a straightforward task since the theoretical translation does not produce nets which conform to the input format required by the verifier. The paper states how this mismatch has been overcome and draws conclusions for future uses of unfoldings technique in the modelchecking of mobile systems...|$|E
40|$|Seven leading female artists {{explored}} {{the notion of}} narrative, the great <b>unfolder</b> of fact and fiction, in this exhibition presented by ACCA Curator Rebecca Coates.

They {{explored the}} world of narrative {{through a variety of}} media including film, photogravure etching, sculpture, painting and installation. The exhibition title derived from a renowned quote from Jane Austen&# 039;s Pride and Prejudice, &# 039;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife&# 039; Kosloff&# 039;s research is around the reinterpretation of everyday scenes and the general milieu of life to challenge the continuum of time and hazes perceptions of time with place and persona. &# 039;Snap happy&# 039; is a black and white Super 8 film in which Kosloff documents a group of tourists as they photograph and experience their surroundings. Her use of outmoded technology to document this contemporary scene plays with our impressions of the past and our assumptions about the present. The Super 8 camera acts as a filter, reinterpreting everyday scenes and disengaging them from a contemporary sense of time and space. This two-minute video work highlights the moving image as simulacra, by drawing attention to the contingency of representational practices in art and daily life. &# 039;Truth explores a particular sensibility,&# 039; says ACCA Curator Rebecca Coates. &# 039;There&# 039;s a questioning, a suggestiveness, a lingering refrain, as narrative is written, rewritten and allowed to remain ambiguous. &# 039; Kosloff&# 039;s Super 8 films explore the subjective process of truth in relation to time, space and memory. These films capture people interacting with the built world, undertaking work and leisure activities. A catalogue of the exhibition was written by Coates and Louise Adler.
