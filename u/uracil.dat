Class switch recombination (CSR) is instigated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase, which converts cytosines in switch regions to <b>uracils.</b> The <b>uracils</b> are subsequently removed by two DNA-repair pathways, resulting in mutations, single-strand DNA breaks, and the double-strand breaks required for CSR.

40|$|In humans, {{there are}} four known glycosylases that {{initiate}} repair of <b>uracils</b> in DNA. These are UNG, TDG, SMUG 1, and MBD 4.

We aimed at elucidating the specific function of the two main human uracil-DNA glycosylases in vitro and in vivo to further clarify their distinct roles in repair of <b>uracils</b> in the genome (Paper I).

40|$|Cytosines in {{single-stranded}} DNA deaminate to <b>uracils</b> at 140 {{times the}} rate for cytosines in double-stranded DNA. If resulting <b>uracils</b> are not replaced with cytosine, C to T mutations occur. These facts suggest that cellular processes such as transcription that create single-stranded DNA should promote C to T mutations. We tested this hypothesis with the Escherichia coli tac promoter and found that induction of transcription causes ≈ 4 -fold increase {{in the frequency of}} C to U or 5 -methylcytosine to T deaminations in the nontranscribed strand. Excess mutations caused by C to U deaminations were reduced, but not eliminated, by uracil-DNA glycosylase. Similarly, mutations caused by 5 -methylcytosine to T deaminations were only partially reduced by the very short-patch repair process in E. coli. These effects are unlikely to be caused by differential repair of the two strands, and our results suggest that all actively transcribed genes in E. coli should acquire more C to T mutations in the nontranscribed strand...|$|R

5|$|Another {{approach}} ignores {{energy and}} deals {{only with the}} molecular complexity estimated by the information entropy index. It speculates that the points of several natural compounds (urea, pyrimidine, dihydroxyacetone, <b>uracil,</b> cytosine, glycine, and alanine) fall into {{the range of the}} values typical for the known interstellar molecules that indicates high probability of their detection in interstellar environment. Additionally the molecules with maximal information entropy, i.e. the most complex compounds, make up approximately a half of the interstellar set and their percentage is decreased with the size. This trend may be associated with the different stabilities of the molecules with uniform (usually more stable) and diversified (usually less stable) chemical structures, so the detectable molecules with a large size must possess symmetric structure more probably than non-symmetric. The remarkable detection of low-entropy (highly symmetric) fullerene molecules supports this assumption. It is also noted that information entropy reflects the depth of hydrogenation of interstellar entities: the molecules with maximal information entropy are hydrogen-poor whereas the others are mainly hydrogen-rich.|$|E
5|$|Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a {{polymeric}} molecule {{essential in}} various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes. RNA and DNA are nucleic acids, and, along with lipids, proteins and carbohydrates, constitute {{the four major}} macromolecules essential for all known forms of life. Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of nucleotides, but unlike DNA it is more often found in nature as a single-strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double-strand. Cellular organisms use messenger RNA (mRNA) to convey genetic information (using the letters G, U, A, and C to denote the nitrogenous bases guanine, <b>uracil,</b> adenine, and cytosine) that directs synthesis of specific proteins. Many viruses encode their genetic information using an RNA genome.|$|E
5|$|To furnish a {{functional}} oligonucleotide, all the protecting groups {{have to be}} removed. The N-acyl base protection and the 2-cyanoethyl phosphate protection may be, and is often removed simultaneously by treatment with inorganic bases or amines. However, the applicability of this method {{is limited by the}} fact that the cleavage of 2-cyanoethyl phosphate protection gives rise to acrylonitrile as a side product. Under the strong basic conditions required for the removal of N-acyl protection, acrylonitrile is capable of alkylation of nucleic bases, primarily, at the N3-position of thymine and <b>uracil</b> residues to give the respective N3-(2-cyanoethyl) adducts via Michael reaction. The formation of these side products may be avoided by treating the solid support-bound oligonucleotides with solutions of bases in an organic solvent, for instance, with 50% triethylamine in acetonitrile or 10% diethylamine in acetonitrile. This treatment is strongly recommended for medium- and large scale preparations and is optional for syntheses on small scale where the concentration of acrylonitrile generated in the deprotection mixture is low.|$|E
40|$|Cytosine DNA {{methylation}} is an epigenetic mark {{implicated in}} several biological processes. Bisulfite treatment of DNA is acknowledged as {{the gold standard}} technique to study methylation. This technique introduces changes in the genomic DNA by converting cytosines to <b>uracils</b> while 5 -methylcytosines remain nonreactive. During PCR amplification 5 -methylcytosines are amplified as cytosine, whereas <b>uracils</b> and thymines as thymine. To detect the methylation levels, reads treated with the bisulfite must be aligned against a reference genome. Mapping these reads to a reference genome represents a significant computational challenge mainly due to the increased search space {{and the loss of}} information introduced by the treatment. To deal with this computational challenge we devised GPU-BSM, a tool based on modern Graphics Processing Units. Graphics Processing Units are hardware accelerators that are increasingly being used successfully to accelerate general-purpose scientific applications. GPU-BSM is a tool able to map bisulfite-treated reads from whole genome bisulfite sequencing and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, and to estimate methylation levels, with the goal of detecting methylation. Due to the massive parallelization obtained by exploiting graphics cards, GPU-BSM aligns bisulfite-treated reads faster than other cutting-edge solutions, while outperforming most of them in terms of uniqu...|$|R

PCR amplification is then {{carried out with}} primers designed to amplify both methylated and unmethylated templates. After this amplification, highly methylated DNA sequences contain a higher number of CpG sites compared to unmethylated templates, which results in a different melting temperature {{that can be used}} in quantitative methylation detection.|$|R
40|$|Activation-induced {{cytidine}} deaminase (AID) protein initiates Ig {{gene mutation}} by deaminating cytosines, converting them into <b>uracils.</b> Excision of AID-induced <b>uracils</b> by uracil-N-glycosylase {{is responsible for}} most transversion mutations at G:C base pairs. On the other hand, processing of AID-induced G:U mismatches by mismatch repair factors is responsible for most mutation at Ig A:T base pairs. Why mismatch processing should be error prone is unknown. One theory proposes that long patch excision in G 1 -phase leads to dUTP-incorporation opposite adenines {{as a result of}} the higher G 1 -phase ratio of nuclear dUTP to dTTP. Subsequent base excision at the A:U base pairs produced could then create non-instructional templates leading to permanent mutations at A:T base pairs (1). This compelling theory has remained untested. We have developed a method to rapidly modify DNA repair pathways in mutating mouse B cells in vivo by transducing Ig knock-in splenic mouse B cells with GFP-tagged retroviruses, then adoptively transferring GFP+ cells, along with appropriate antigen, into primed congenic hosts. We have used this method to show that dUTP-incorporation is unlikely to be the cause of AID-induced mutation of A:T base pairs, and instead propose that A:T mutations might arise as an indirect consequence of nucleotide paucity during AID-induced DNA repair...|$|R
