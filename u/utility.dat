50|$|Comparing the {{performance}} of water and sanitation service providers (<b>utilities)</b> is needed, because the sector offers limited scope for direct competition (natural monopoly).

Benchmarking {{the performance}} of <b>utilities</b> allows to simulate competition, establish realistic targets for improvement and create pressure {{to catch up with}} better <b>utilities.</b> Information on benchmarks for water and sanitation <b>utilities</b> is provided by the International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation <b>Utilities.</b>|$|R
40|$|After storm-related power outages, {{many have}} {{recommended}} municipalizing investor-owned <b>utilities,</b> claiming that profit-making <b>utilities</b> have insufficient incentive {{to prepare for}} storms. I provide empirical evidence that municipal <b>utilities</b> spend more on maintenance of their distribution network than investor-owned <b>utilities.</b> Nonetheless, I find that storms significantly disrupt electricity consumption in areas served by municipal <b>utilities</b> but do not disrupt areas served by investor-owned <b>utilities.</b> These results {{are based on a}} stratified random sample of 241 investor-owned, 96 cooperative, and 94 municipal <b>utilities</b> in the United States between 1999 and 2012. I conclude that municipal utilitiesﾒ in-efficiencies are more important in causing power outages than investor-owned utilitiesﾒ disincentives to spend on maintenance...|$|R
