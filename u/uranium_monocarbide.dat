Further work to increase {{the density of the}} sintered pellets is needed. A stock of several pounds of stoichiometric <b>uranium</b> <b>monocarbide</b> was prepared by carbon reduction of uranium dioxide. Pellets having bulk densities ranging from 93 to 96 % theoretical were obtained by cold pressing and sfntering. Initial experiments on the fabrication of bars, 3 by 1 / 2 by 1 / 4 in., by cold pressing and sintering, resulted in sound but somewhat low-density bodies. A few experiments were conducted on the production of <b>uranium</b> <b>monocarbide</b> from ammonium diuranate. The results indicate that considerable addftional work may be necessary to consistently produce a stoichiometric product. The simultaneous synthesis ard hot pressing of <b>uranium</b> <b>monocarbide</b> was funther studied and pellets with balk densities as high as 96. 6 % theoretical (based on 100 % UC) were produced. However, metallographic examination disclosed the presence of some free uranium metal in all pellets.

However, UPuC is pyrophoric and fine powders of UPuC are subject to temperature increase due to oxidation with air and possible ignition during conditioning and handling. In a first approach and to allow easier experimental conditions, this study was undertaken on <b>uranium</b> <b>monocarbide</b> (UC) with the aim to determine safe handling conditions for the production and reprocessing of uranium carbide fuels. The reactivity of <b>uranium</b> <b>monocarbide</b> in oxidizing atmosphere was studied in order to analyze the ignition process. Experimental thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) revealed that UC powder obtained by arc melting and milling is highly reactive in air at about 200 degrees C. The phases formed at the various observed stages of the oxidation process were analyzed by Xray diffraction. At the same time, ignition was analyzed thermodynamically along isothermal sections of the U-C-O ternary diagram and {{the pressure of the}} gas produced by the UC + O- 2 reaction was calculated. Two possible oxidation schemes were identified on the U-C-O phase diagram and assumptions are proposed concerning the overall oxidation and ignition paths. It is particularly important to understand the mechanisms involved since temperatures as high as 2500 degrees C could be reached, leading to CO(g) production and possibly to a blast effect.

40|$|International audienceMixed {{plutonium}} and <b>uranium</b> <b>monocarbide</b> (UPuC) {{is considered}} as a possible fuel material for future nuclear gas fast reactors. Its safe handling is currently a major concern, because inflammation of this material under the shape of fine powders is easy and highly exothermic (pyrophoricity) even under ambient temperature and partial pressure of oxygen inferior to 0. 2 bar. CEA Marcoule is implied in both experimental and numerical studies on the UC powder oxidation exothermic reaction. Experimental tests consist in determining the influence of various parameters (gas composition, heating ramp, specific surface of powders) on the sample inflammation temperature. Two kinds of analytical apparatus are used: The differential thermal analysis (DTA) and the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) coupled to the thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA). These apparatus are also linked to a gas mass spectrometer to follow the composition of combustion chamber gases.

40|$|<b>Uranium</b> <b>monocarbide,</b> a {{potential}} fuel {{material for the}} generation IV reactors, is investigated within density functional theory. Its electronic, magnetic, elastic, and phonon properties are analyzed and {{discussed in terms of}} spin-orbit interaction and localized versus itinerant behavior of the 5 f electrons. The localization of the 5 f states is tuned by varying the local Coulomb repulsion interaction parameter. We demonstrate that the theoretical electronic structure, elastic constants, phonon dispersions, and their densities of states can reproduce accurately the results of x-ray photoemission and bremsstrahlung isochromat measurements as well as inelastic neutron scattering experiments only when the 5 f states experience the spin-orbit interaction and simultaneously remain partially localized. The partial localization of the 5 f electrons could be represented by a moderate value of the on-site Coulomb interaction parameter of about 2 eV. The results of the present studies indicate that both strong electron correlations and spin-orbit effects are crucial for realistic theoretical description of the ground-state properties of uranium carbide.

40|$|International audienceAb initio {{electron}} theory {{based on}} the projector-augmented-wave method in the generalized gradient approximation of the density functional theory is used for calculating formation and migration energies of point defects in <b>uranium</b> <b>monocarbide</b> (UC). The use of the Hubbard term to describe the 5 f electrons of uranium is discussed {{on the basis of}} the density of states and cohesive energies. A formalism allowing the "raw" calculated energies to be normalized is proposed to take into account the compositional dependence of defective crystals. Such formation energies are then used to determine the population of predominant defects as a function of nonstoichiometry. We identify the most stable defects as uranium antisites and carbon vacancies for UC(1 -x), and dimers C(2) for UC(1 + x). The most stable thermal defects are obtained, in turn, by formation of complex defects associating dimer C(2) and carbon vacancies whereas carbon Frenkel pairs and Schottky defects require larger formation energies. The migration energies are also calculated for different mechanisms, using as diffusion vectors both thermal vacancy sources and preexisting constitutional defects in the case of off-stoichiometric alloys. We compare the calculated diffusion paths with available experimental data proposed by Matzke [J. Less-Common Met. 121, 537 (1986) ]...|$|E
40|$|International audienceUranium and {{plutonium}} carbides are candidate fuels for Generation IV nuclear reactors. This {{study is}} focused on the characterization of <b>uranium</b> <b>monocarbide</b> samples. The successive fabrication steps were carried out under atmospheres containing low oxygen and moisture concentrations (typically less than 100 ppm) but sample transfers occurred in air. Six samples were sliced from four pellets elaborated by carbothermic reaction under vacuum. Little presence of UC 2 is expected in these samples. The α-UC 2 phase was indeed detected within one of these UC samples during an XRD experiment performed with synchrotron radiation. Moreover, oxygen content at the surface of these samples was depth profiled using a recently developed nuclear reaction analysis method. Large oxygen concentrations were measured in the first micron below the sample surface and particularly in the first 100 – 150 nm. UC 2 inclusions were found to be more oxidized than the surrounding matrix. This work points out to the fact that more care must be given at each step of UC fabrication since the material readily reacts with oxygen and moisture.

XRD determines phase uniqueness and the increase of the lattice parameter versus the carbon content. In contrast, 13 C NMR detects the different carbon environments in the lattice and in this study, clearly identifies the presence of discrete peaks for carbon in the octahedral lattice site in UC and an additional peak associated with excess carbon in hyperstoichiometric samples. Two peaks associated with different levels of carbon deficiency are detected for all hypostochiometric compositions. In fact, more than one carbon environment is always detected by 13 C NMR. This emphasizes the difficulty in obtaining a perfect stoichiometric <b>uranium</b> <b>monocarbide</b> UC 1. 00.

The results obtained by EXAFS highlight subtle differences between the different stoichiometries and in the hyperstoichiometric samples.

A fast multi-channel spectro-pyrometer has been employed for the radiance measurements of samples heated up to and beyond their melting point by laser irradiation. The melting temperature of <b>uranium</b> <b>monocarbide,</b> soundly established at 2780 K, has been taken as a radiance reference. Based on it, a wavelength-dependence has been obtained for the high-temperature spectral emissivity of some uranium carbides (1 â©½ C/U â©½ 2). Similarly, the peritectic temperature of plutonium monocarbide (1900 K) {{has been used as}} a reference for plutonium monocarbide and sesquicarbide.

However, their high temperature behaviour, values in the liquid, and carbon-content and wavelength dependencies in the visible-near infrared range have been determined here for the first time. Liquid uranium carbide seems to interact with electromagnetic radiation in a more metallic way than does the solid, whereas a similar effect has not been observed for plutonium carbides. The current emissivity values have also been used to convert the measured radiance spectra into real temperature, and thus perform a thermal analysis of the laser heated samples.
