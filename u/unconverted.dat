5|$|The {{game was}} played on 18 November on an icy pitch (straw had not been spread over the pitch the night before), which nearly caused the game to be cancelled. The All Blacks kicked off, and had {{the best of the}} first ten minutes. Scotland {{eventually}} got a scrum near the All Blacks goal-line, and after winning the scrum, passed to Ernest Simson, who dropped a goal to put Scotland ahead 4–0. It {{was the first time the}} All Blacks had been behind on tour. The All Blacks replied with a try under the posts, which was <b>unconverted.</b> A second try was then scored, by Smith; again it went <b>unconverted.</b> Scotland then scored an <b>unconverted</b> try, to lead at half time 7–6. With less than ten minutes to go the score remained 7–6 and it looked like the All Blacks might lose their first match on tour. However, with four minutes to go the All Blacks had a scrum on halfway; the resulting movement finished with George Smith crossing for a try. Bill Cunningham then scored a try with seconds remaining, and the All Blacks were victorious 12–7.|$|E

5|$|The {{match on}} 15 June was {{played at the}} Agricultural Ground in front of 12,000 spectators. NSW soon put points on the {{scoreboard}} when O'Donnell marked and Verge kicked a goal. Queensland responded soon after with an <b>unconverted</b> try, and then, after some fast play, scored a second try, this one converted to put the visitors ahead 4–8. Verge then kicked a penalty goal to bring the difference to one point. The second half was a demonstration of good attacking play and strong defensive work on both sides. The only points scored were from a try for Queensland, giving them a 7–11 win.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to its {{proximity}} to the first Christian communities of Palestine, Provincia Arabia, of which Philippopolis was a part, {{was among the first}} regions to convert to Christianity. By the time of Philip's birth, the region had been extensively Christianized, especially in the north and in Hellenized settlements like those of Auranitis. The region is known to have had a fully developed synodal system (in which bishops from the dioceses in the region met to discuss Church affairs) by the mid-3rd century. The region sent six bishops to the Council of Nicaea in 325, and Eusebius' Onomasticon, a gazetteer of Biblical place-names, records a wholly Christian village called Cariathaim, or Caraiatha, near Madaba. Outside of the cities, however, there is less evidence of Christianization. Before the 5th century there is little evidence of the faith, and many villages remained <b>unconverted</b> in the 6th. Philippopolis, which was a small village for most of this period, does not have a Christian inscription that can be dated earlier than 552. It is not known when the village established a prelateship, but it must have been sometime before 451, when it sent a bishop to the Council of Chalcedon.|$|E
5|$|The {{second test}} match, on 23 July at the Exhibition Ground in Brisbane, started well for Australia. In the first quarter, a kick from Wickham towards the British corner {{was picked up}} by Pat McEvedy, the New Zealand-born winger playing for Britain, and he was tackled into touch by the Australian forward Alec Burdon. The ball then came to Verge, who kicked towards the British halfback Bush, and Burdon took it and ran over the tryline for the opening score, with no conversion. The British {{levelled}} the score {{at the start of the}} second half with an <b>unconverted</b> try by Bush, and then immediately after, he scored a drop goal to put the visitors 3–7 ahead. The British added a further ten points to their tally, and won the match 3–17. Verge kicked well in this game, according to The Sunday Times. Verge was not selected to play in the third test, and returned to play for the University team.|$|E
5|$|All these {{achievements}} were {{a prelude}} to the 1927 Wimbledon Championships where in successive rounds Cochet defeated two leading Americans Frank Hunter and Bill Tilden and finally Jean Borotra in remarkable five set matches, {{all of whom had}} a two-sets advantage against him. Tilden served for the match, leading 5–1 in the third set and had a match ball. In the final Borotra left six match points <b>unconverted</b> to open the route for Cochet's revival. With the latter one Cochet set a Wimbledon final comeback record that stands up to this day. He then again met Hunter and Tilden in the final of the doubles, this time he joining forces with Jacques Brugnon and lost the championship despite having a match point. This was the first of three consecutive encounters between the French and American teams as in early September the 1927 Davis Cup final took place in the United States where the US Davis Cup team led by Tilden and Hunter faced the challenging team of the Musketeers. France won 3–2 with Cochet victorious in the decider against Bill Johnston and reclaiming the Davis Cup for France the first time since 1920. A couple of days later the French troupe went to compete in the U.S. National Championships at the West Side Tennis Club in New York. Cochet and Eileen Bennett became the mixed doubles champions. When he returned home {{in the first week of}} October Cochet took revenge on Christian Boussus in their second meeting in the final of the Coupe Porée of Paris. The same week he was ranked third in the world for the second consecutive year although this time he finished ahead of compatriot Borotra. In November he won the Swiss Covered Courts Internationals in a short twenty-five-minute final against Donald Greig.|$|E
5|$|Written by Gerry Davis, this four-part {{story was}} {{submitted}} on spec {{to the production}} office around February 1982. It concerned the Doctor arriving on Mondas {{at a point in}} time when the Cybermen are being created. The rough storyline was where the Doctor and his companion “Felicity” arrive on the planet Mondas, Earth's twin orbiting {{on the opposite side of}} the Sun. While the Doctor works on a piece of TARDIS equipment, Felicity encounters the gentle Prince Sylvan. Sylvan accidentally activates the TARDIS, sending him, the Doctor and Felicity fifty years into the future. There, Sylvan's brother, Dega, is now king and has used the Doctor's device to begin turning his people into Cybermen. He has constructed a space fleet with which he intends to invade the mineral-rich Earth, and plans to kill any <b>unconverted</b> Mondans with cyanide gas. Felicity appeals to Dega's partly Cybernised wife, Queen Meta, and she shoots her husband dead—only to be killed by Dega's chief of staff, Krail. In the confusion, Sylvan and a band of Mondan rebels flee in the spaceships to Earth; the massive concussion of take-off knocks Mondas out of its orbit into deep space. Former script editor Davis submitted this idea circa early 1981, intending it to be a prequel to his and Kit Pedler's original Cyberman serial, The Tenth Planet (which also featured Cyberman Krail). It also borrowed elements from The Ark and The Savages, two stories which Davis had been story editor on. Producer John Nathan-Turner and script editor Antony Root were ultimately not interested in Genesis of the Cybermen. Davis wrote his storyline with only the Doctor and one female companion in mind; he called this character “Felicity” rather than writing with any particular companion in mind. This idea would be later explored in the Big Finish audio adventure Spare Parts by Marc Platt and released in July 2002. In turn Spare Parts was heavily borrowed from for the television episodes Rise of the Cybermen and The Age of Steel in 2006.|$|E

25|$|Barrientos {{went so far}} as to {{make sure}} that he was descended from {{converted}} Jews.

The remaining <b>unconverted</b> F-111As were mothballed at Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in June 1991.|$|E
25|$|By 1742, {{the revival}} had entered {{a more radical}} and {{disruptive}} phase. Lay people became more active participants in the services by crying out, exhorting, or having visions. Uneducated men and women began to preach without formal training, and some itinerant preachers were active in parishes without {{the approval of the}} local pastor. Enthusiasts even claimed that many of the clergy were <b>unconverted</b> themselves and thus unqualified to be ministers. Congregationalists split into Old Lights and New Lights over the Awakening, with Old Lights opposing it and New Lights supporting it.|$|E
25|$|The next {{batch of}} ten P class {{locomotives}} were constructed locally in Western Australia in 1927, at the Midland Railway Workshops. They were {{identical to the}} North British locomotives excepting the short tenders rebuilt {{from those of the}} obsolete R class engines. This order was extended by an additional five locomotives which were delivered in 1929, bringing the total to twenty-five locomotives. Several exchanges of tenders occurred throughout the service life of the P and Pr class locomotives, such as exchanging the long tender of an <b>unconverted</b> P class locomotive for the short tender of a later Pr class engine.|$|E
25|$|Baxter's health {{had grown}} even worse, yet {{this was the}} period of his {{greatest}} activity as a writer. He wrote 168 or so separate works, including major treatises such as the Christian Directory, the Methodus Theologiae Christianae, and the Catholic Theology. His Breviate of the Life of Mrs Margaret Baxter records the virtues {{of his wife and}} tenderness which otherwise might not have been known. A slim devotional work published in 1658 under the title Call to the <b>Unconverted</b> to Turn and Live formed one of the core extra-biblical texts of evangelicalism until at least the middle of the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{aluminum}} oxide serves as dielectric and also protects the metallic aluminum against aggressive chemical reactions from the electrolyte. However, the converted layer of {{aluminum oxide}} {{is usually not}} homogeneous. It forms a complex multilayer structured laminate of amorphous, crystalline and porous crystalline aluminum oxide mostly covered with small residual parts of <b>unconverted</b> aluminum hydroxide. For this reason, {{in the formation of}} the anode foil, the oxide film is structured by a special chemical treatment so that either an amorphous oxide or a crystalline oxide is formed. The amorphous oxide variety yields higher mechanical and physical stability and fewer defects, thus increasing the long term stability and lowering the leakage current.|$|E
25|$|Bisulfite {{sequencing}} {{relies on}} the conversion of every single unmethylated cytosine residue to uracil. If conversion is incomplete, the subsequent analysis will incorrectly interpret the <b>unconverted</b> unmethylated cytosines as methylated cytosines, resulting in false positive results for methylation. Only cytosines in single-stranded DNA are susceptible to attack by bisulfite, therefore denaturation of the DNA undergoing analysis is critical. It is important to ensure that reaction parameters such as temperature and salt concentration are suitable to maintain the DNA in a single-stranded conformation and allow for complete conversion. Embedding the DNA in agarose gel {{has been reported to}} improve the rate of conversion by keeping strands of DNA physically separate.|$|E
25|$|The {{completion}} of the Reconquista {{was not the only}} significant act performed by Ferdinand and Isabella in that year. In March 1492, the monarchs issued the Edict of Expulsion of the Jews, also called the Alhambra Decree, a document which ordered all Jews either to be baptised and convert to Christianity or to leave the country.. It allowed Mudéjar Moors (Islamic) and converso Marrano Jews to stay, while expelling all <b>unconverted</b> Jews from Castile and Aragon (most Jews either converted or moved to Islamic lands of North Africa and the Ottoman Empire). 1492 was also the year in which the monarchs commissioned Christopher Columbus to find a westward maritime route for access to Asia, which resulted in the Spanish arrival in the Americas.|$|E
25|$|After the {{issuance}} of Spain's Alhambra Decree in 1492, {{a large proportion of}} the <b>unconverted</b> Jews chose exile rather than conversion, many of them crossing the border to Portugal. In Portugal, however, the Jews were again issued with a similar decree just a few years later in 1497, giving them the choice of exile or conversion. Unlike in Spain, however, in actual practice Portugal mostly prevented them from leaving, thus they necessarily stayed as ostensible converts to Christianity whether they wished to or not, after the Portuguese King reasoned that by their failure to leave they accepted Christianity by default. For this reason, crypto-Judaism was far more prevalent in Portugal than in Spain, even though many of these families were originally of Spanish rather than Portuguese descent.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the city}} of Granada was now under Christian control, the {{uprising}} spread to the Granadan countryside. The leader of the rebellion fled to the Alpujarra mountains in January 1500. Fearing that they would also be forced to convert, the population there quickly rose up in insurrection. However, {{after a series of}} campaigns in 1500–01 in which 80,000 Christian troops were mobilized and King Ferdinand personally directed some operations, the rebellion was defeated. The terms of surrender of the defeated rebels generally required them to accept baptism. By 1501, not a single <b>unconverted</b> Muslim remained in Granada.|$|E
500|$|World War II took a heavy {{toll on the}} {{remaining}} battlecruisers, both converted and <b>unconverted.</b> In contrast to World War I, where all four ships were lost to gunfire, only two were sunk solely by guns. [...] Two battlecruisers were sunk {{by a combination of}} gunfire and aerial attack, four were sunk solely by aircraft and two were sunk by submarines. [...] The largest loss of life in the sinking of a battlecruiser was the 1,415 killed in the sinking of HMS Hood during her confrontation with the [...] in 1941. Of the three surviving World War II battlecruisers, two were scrapped after the war and one, , was sunk by nuclear weapon tests in 1946.|$|E
500|$|The {{match was}} preceded by an All Black haka, to which the crowd responded with the Welsh {{national}} song [...] "Land of my Fathers". Wales had developed tactics to negate the seven-man New Zealand scrum, and removed a man from their scrum to play as a [...] "rover", equivalent to Gallaher's wing-forward position. Gallaher was consistently penalised by the Scottish referee, John Dallas, who held that the New Zealander was feeding {{the ball into the}} scrum incorrectly. This eventually compelled Gallaher to instruct his team not to contest the scrums, and therefore give Wales possession following each scrum. Bob Deans, playing at wing for New Zealand that day, later said that Dallas had gone [...] "out to penalise Gallaherthere is no doubt about that". Teddy Morgan scored an <b>unconverted</b> try for Wales shortly before half-time to give the home side a 3–0 lead.|$|E
500|$|The title {{ascribed}} to the hymn, [...] "1 Chronicles 17:16–17", refers to David's reaction to the prophet Nathan telling him that God intends to maintain his family line forever. Some Christians interpret this as a prediction that Jesus Christ, as a descendant of David, was promised by God as the salvation for all people. Newton's sermon on that January day in 1773 focused on the necessity to express one's gratefulness for God's guidance, that God {{is involved in the}} daily lives of Christians though they may not be aware of it, and that patience for deliverance from the daily trials of life is warranted when the glories of eternity await. Newton saw himself a sinner like David who had been chosen, perhaps undeservedly, and was humbled by it. According to Newton, <b>unconverted</b> sinners were [...] "blinded by the god of this world" [...] until [...] "mercy came to us not only undeserved but undesired... our hearts endeavored to shut him out till he overcame us by the power of his grace." ...|$|E
500|$|On 3 March, France {{played host to}} England at the Parc des Princes. England were victorious {{but it was a}} good contest, {{with the}} final score 3–11. The French defended well, but England scored two tries and a {{conversion}} and were leading 0–8 at half time. After the break, the French played with [...] "dash and spirit", repeatedly coming close to scoring until, with 20 minutes to go, Guillemin chased a long kick from Lesieur and scored a try, which went <b>unconverted.</b> For the final ten minutes, with an injury to Lane, France held on with fourteen men on the field. The French press was delighted not to have witnessed another crushing defeat, comparing the result with England's recent score of 11–6 against Wales. As well as having improved in the ability to play the game, the fitness of the players was much improved, {{and they were able to}} keep going right to the end. The annihilation anticipated for the second half did not come, with each side scoring three points, Guillemin amongst the best of the French forwards.|$|E
500|$|The All Blacks' last {{match in}} the British Isles was against Swansea at Saint Helen's Ground on 30 December. Swansea had only lost once in over two seasons (to Cardiff) {{and were the}} {{champion}} club team of Great Britain. Wallace said of the match [...] "This was the thirty-second match of the tour and our hearts rejoiced {{at the thought that}} this was to be the last." [...] The first half was mainly spent in All Blacks territory as they struggled to gain ground kicking into a strong wind and, after 25 minutes, Swansea scored a try through Fred Scrine that was <b>unconverted.</b> The half finished 3–0 to Swansea. The All Blacks playing with the wind to their backs nearly scored a try to McGregor but he was ruled to have stepped out. However, soon after, Wallace gained possession and ran towards Swansea's 25-yard line before kicking a drop-goal in the strong wind to give the All Blacks a 4–3 lead. The All Blacks then kept forcing Swansea back with kick after kick for the next 15 minutes to win the match 4–3.|$|E

2500|$|Nevertheless, the {{decision}} to accept or reject the Half-Way Covenant belonged to each congregation. Some churches maintained the original standard into the 1700s. Other churches went beyond the Half-Way Covenant, opening baptism to all infants {{whether or not their}} parents or grandparents had been baptized. Other churches, citing the belief that baptism and the Lord's Supper were [...] "converting ordinances" [...] capable of helping the <b>unconverted</b> achieve salvation, allowed the <b>unconverted</b> to receive the Lord's Supper as well.|$|E
2500|$|Conversos, {{whatever}} their real religious views, often (but not always) tended {{to marry and}} associate among themselves. As they achieved prominent positions in trade and in the Royal administration, they attracted considerable resentment from the [...] "Old Christians". [...] The ostensible reason given for issuance of the 1492 Alhambra Decree for the conversion, expulsion or execution of the <b>unconverted</b> Jews from Spain was that the <b>unconverted</b> Jews had supported the New Christian conversos in the crypto-Jewish practices of the latter, thus delaying or preventing their assimilation into the Christian community.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the years}} after the Antinomian Controversy, Congregationalists {{struggled}} {{with the problem of}} decreasing conversions among second-generation settlers. [...] These <b>unconverted</b> adults had been baptized as infants and most of them studied the Bible, attended church and raised their children as Christians. Nevertheless, they were barred from receiving the Lord's Supper, voting or holding office, and from having their children (the grandchildren of church members) baptized. As the number of <b>unconverted</b> adults grew, church leaders began to think of alternative ways of tying people to the church without abandoning the idea that the church should be one of believers.|$|E
2500|$|The Alhambra Decree (also {{known as}} the Edict of Expulsion) was an edict issued on 31 March 1492, by the joint Catholic Monarchs of Spain (Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon) {{ordering}} the expulsion of all <b>unconverted</b> practicing Jews from the Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon, including from all its territories and possessions, by 31 July of that year. The {{primary purpose of the}} expulsion was to eliminate the influence of <b>unconverted</b> Jews on Spain's by then large Jewish-origin New Christian converso population, to ensure that the prior did not encourage the latter to relapse and revert to Judaism.|$|E
2500|$|Although the 1492 and 1497 expulsions of <b>unconverted</b> Jews from Spain and Portugal were {{separate}} {{events from}} the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions (which was established {{over a decade}} earlier in 1478), they were ultimately linked, as the Inquisition eventually also led to the fleeing out of Iberia of many descendants of Jewish converts to Catholicism in subsequent generations.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the {{original}} Edicts of Expulsion did not apply to Jewish-origin New Christian conversos, as they were legally Christians, the discriminatory practices which the Inquisition placed upon conversos, which were often lethal, placed pressure on many of them to also emigrate from Spain and Portugal in the immediate generations following the expulsion of <b>unconverted</b> Jews.|$|E
2500|$|The New Divinity's {{theology}} {{of religious experience}} was influenced by Edwards's works Treatise Concerning Religious Affections and The Nature of True Virtue. The New Divinity argued that the true Christian seeks the good of all things, including God and other people, above themselves. This was called [...] "disinterested benevolence" [...] because Christian benevolence is never self-serving, unlike the benevolence of the <b>unconverted.</b>|$|E
