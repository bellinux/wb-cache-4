GPI-type MT-MMPs (MT 4 - and MT 6 -MMP) are related to other MT-MMPs, but their physiological substrates and functions in vivo {{have yet to be}} identified. In this manuscript we show that MT 4 -MMP is expressed early in kidney development, {{as well as in the}} adult kidney, where the highest levels of expression are found in the papilla.

However, MT 4 -MMP-null mice had decreased daily water intake and daily urine output, consistent with primary hypodipsia.

The increased reabsorption of Na leads to increased water and urea reabsorption from the proximal tubules of the kidney back into the blood.

40|$|Angiotensin {{produced}} systemically or locally in tissues such as {{the brain}} {{plays an important role}} in the regulation of blood pressure and in the development of hypertension. We have established transgenic rats [TGR(ASrAOGEN) ] expressing an antisense RNA against angiotensinogen mRNA specifically in the brain. In these animals, the brain angiotensinogen level is reduced by more than 90 % and the drinking response to intracerebroventricular renin infusions is decreased markedly compared with control rats. Blood pressure of transgenic rats is lowered by 8 mmHg (1 mmHg = 133 Pa) compared with control rats. Crossbreeding of TGR(ASrAOGEN) with a hypertensive transgenic rat strain exhibiting elevated angiotensin II levels in tissues results in a marked attenuation of the hypertensive phenotype.

This study was designed to investigate the effect of mixed hydro-alcoholic extract of N. sativa and C. longa on the {{oxidative stress}} induced by Adriamycin (ADR) in rat kidney. Material and Method: The animals were divided into 6 groups: control (CO), ADR, Adriamycin+ Vitamin C (ADR+VIT C), C. longa extract+ Adriamycin (C. LE+ADR), N. sativa extract+ Adriamycin (N. SE+ADR) and C. longa extract+ N. sativa extract + Adriamycin (N. S+C. L+ADR). ADR (5 mg/kg) was injected intravenously, whereas VITC (100 mg/kg) and extract of C. longa (1000 mg/kg) and N. sativa (200 mg/kg) were administrated orally. Finally, the renal tissue, urine and blood samples were collected and submitted to measure of redox markers, osmolarity and renal index. Results: The renal content of total thiol and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity significantly decreased and Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration increased in Adriamycin group compared to control group. The renal content of total thiol and SOD activity significantly enhanced and MDA concentration reduced in treated-mixed extract of C. longa and N. sativa along with ADR group compared to ADR group.

40|$|Melatonin induced cyclic {{modulation}} of vectorial {{water transport}} in kidney-derived MDCK cells. BackgroundMelatonin, newly synthesized by the pineal gland, is rapidly released to general circulation reaching a nanomolar concentration. Cyclic production of melatonin synchronizes body rhythms with the photoperiod. Moreover, changes in <b>urine</b> production and <b>osmolarity</b> {{have been observed}} in the kidney during the night. However, the precise mechanisms by which plasma-circulating melatonin modifies renal physiology are not clearly understood. MethodsMadin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell monolayers transport water vectorially from the apical to the basolateral side forming blisters or domes. Transport in epithelial cells is regulated by tight junction sealing, ion pumps and channels, and cytoskeleton organization, among other processes. MDCK cells were used to study vectorial water transport to determine the role of microfilament organization and protein kinase C (PKC) in dome formation in culture conditions that mimic the cyclic pattern of melatonin circulation in plasma. ResultsMelatonin cyclically increased dome formation by 50 % and caused enlargement and thickening of stress fibers in cells surrounding the domes. Optimal increase in dome formation was observed at nanomolar concentrations of melatonin after 6 hours, concomitantly with a 28 % decrease in the transepithelial electrical resistance, which remained low for up to 12 hours, without apparent change in fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -dextran flux. A blockage in dome formation elicited by melatonin was observed in monolayers preincubated with the Na+-K+-ATPase or PKC inhibitors. ConclusionThe results obtained indicate that melatonin cyclically modifies the transepithelial permeability in kidney-derived cells through PKC activation and microfilament reorganization, and supports the hypothesis that melatonin may synchronize daily body rhythms through cyclic cytoskeletal rearrangements...|$|R

The following parameters related to hydration status were measured: fluid intake, urine output, sweat rate, percent of dehydration, urine parameters (specific gravity, color and osmolarity), body mass and body surface area. Results. We found that the mean fluid intake was 1. 79 ± 0. 8 L/h, sweat rate 2. 7 ± 0. 9 L/h, urine output 55 ± 61 mL and the percentage of dehydration 0. 99 ± 0. 7 %. According to <b>urine</b> <b>osmolarity</b> more than 75 % of players were dehydrated before the game and the process continued during the game. The difference in body mass (0. 9 ± 0. 7 kg) before and after the game was statistically significant. There were statistically significant correlations between the sweat rate and fluid intake, <b>urine</b> <b>osmolarity,</b> body mass loss, body surface area and percentage of dehydration. Fluid intake correlated with the percentage of dehydration, body mass loss, urine specific gravity and urine color. The sweat rate, which varied between the teams, was the highest for centers when this parameter was calculated on the effective time in game. Conclusion. Most of the athletes start competition dehydrated, fail to compensate sweat loss during the game and continue to be dehydrated, regardless what kind of drink was used. These results suggest that hydration strategies must be carefully taken into account, not only by the players, but also by the coaches and the team doctors...|$|E
40|$|Disturbances in renal concentrating ability {{have been}} {{associated}} with hypercalciuria in humans and experimental animals. In a previous work we have shown that extracellular calcium, possibly acting through Calcium Sensing Receptor (CaR) signaling, antagonizes forskolin-induced AQP 2 translocation in renal cells. To test the hypothesis that increased urinary calcium inhibits AQP 2 targeting in response to vasopressin in humans, in this study we evaluated AQP 2 excretion in hypercalciuric children after 1 -deamino-arginin-vasopressin (dDAVP) administration. Normocal- ciuric children served as control. <b>Urine</b> <b>osmolarity</b> and AQP 2 excretion were measured in urine samples obtained hourly after 10 mg (if weight 0. 2 on 3 separate samples. AQP 2 excretion in urine samples was measured by Enzyme-Linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In the group of normocalciuric children having normal urinary concentration ability, dDAVP ad- ministration resulted in a significant increase in urine osmolality (1110 ± 32 mOsm/l at peak, n= 19) associated with a significant increase in urinary AQP 2 excretion (from 250 ± 80 fmol/mg Creat be- fore to 467 ± 113 after dDAVP treatment, P< 0. 0001). In contrast, in hypercalciuric children AQP 2 excretion did not significantly increase in response to dDAVP administration either in the group displaying normal urinary concentration ability (AQP 2 excretion from 291 ± 58. 9 fmol/mg Creat before to 291 ± 77 after dDAVP treatment, <b>urine</b> <b>osmolarity</b> 1018 ± 32 mOsm/l at peak, n= 13). and in the group having poor urinary concentration ability (AQP 2 excretion from 432 ± 117 fmol/mg Creat before to 391 ± 80 after dDAVP test, urine osmolality 512 ± 104 mOsm/l at peak, n= 12). The obtained data demonstrate that in hypercalciuria AQP 2 excretion in response to vasopressin is reduced or abolished. This effect was observed in both normal and poor responders. These data would support the hypothesis that increased urinary calcium levels inhibits AQP 2 targeting in re- sponse to vasopressin in humans possibly through activation of CaR signaling. In hypercalciuric patients the impairment of AQP 2 targeting observed in response to vasopressin may contribute {{to reduce the risk of}} an increased incidence stone formation during antidiuresis...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} water-electrolyte {{metabolism}} indicators {{and its main}} hormones-regulators in 32 patients with transitional cell tumour of the urinary bladder of T 2 a—T 2 b stages before and after radical cystectomy with ileocystoplasty. The most significant changes in water-electrolyte metabolism indicators have been identified during studies on 24 -hour urinary excretion: a significantly large preoperative potassium ion concentration was noted in patients with urinary bladder cancer. Following cystectomy, it decreased to 67 %. Postoperative <b>urine</b> <b>osmolarity</b> decreased to 45 %, excreting sodium fraction increased to 50 % (р  <  0, 05). Preoperative vasopressin concentration was higher than that {{in the control group}} while postoperative one increased to 22 %. Following cystectomy, the adrenocorticotrophic hormone level decreased to 29 %. Preoperatively, the hydrocortisone level in the basic group was higher than that in the control one. It decreased to 16 %, postoperatively. Excretion disorders of osmotic active substances in patients with urinary bladder cancer are due to both reabsorption properties of the intestinal wall and disorders of synthesis and tissue effects of hormones regulating water-electrolyte metabolism. </p...|$|E
