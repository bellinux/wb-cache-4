50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1736 a Romano-British villa was {{discovered}} when tesserae from a large mosaic pavement were <b>uncovered</b> during <b>ploughing.</b> The villa was subsequently located a second time by aerial photography during the extremely dry summer of 1976, when parch marks of buried walls were recorded spread across three fields. A geophysical survey undertaken to accurately locate and amplify the aerial photographic information was carried out over a total of ten days in 1992 and 1993. A total of 19,140 soil resistance values was recorded at one-metre intervals within a grid composed of 20-metre squares.|$|R
50|$|Around 1862, {{when the}} area was ploughed, some of the stones were buried or blasted. Some stones have been taken for a wall to the south. <b>Ploughing</b> <b>uncovered</b> two worked flints and a {{probable}} cist-slab. The circle was surveyed in 1966, {{but it was not}} easy to tell whether the stones have ever been in a standing position.|$|R
50|$|The chapel is at {{the centre}} of a {{circular}} earthwork. In 1957 a monumental slab of Purbeck stone was <b>uncovered</b> by <b>ploughing</b> in a field 402 metres NNE of the chapel. The slab, about 2 metres long and 0.75 metre wide at the head, was carved with a Celtic-style cross in relief. Below the slab was a grave containing the skeleton {{of a woman with}} arms crossed, placed within a row of upright stones. Eight pieces of iron, with traces of wood, were also found in the grave. The woman's age was estimated at 30 to 40 years, and the grave dated to the late 13th century. Nearby were the foundations of a building 2 metres square. The slab is now in the porch of St Nicholas' Church, Worth Matravers.|$|R
2500|$|Over [...] of France {{had to be}} {{cordoned off}} {{at the end of}} the war because of unexploded ordnance. About 20% of the {{chemical}} shells were duds, and approximately 13 million of these munitions were left in place. This has been a serious problem in former battle areas from immediately after the end of the War until the present. Shells may be, for instance, <b>uncovered</b> when farmers <b>plough</b> their fields (termed the 'iron harvest'), and are also regularly discovered when public works or construction work is done.|$|R
2500|$|The {{remains of}} the fort {{have been known to}} antiquarians and historians since the 16th century. In 1552, John Leland wrote that Roman coins had been <b>uncovered</b> in nearby <b>ploughed</b> fields, while William Camden, in 1586, {{mentioned}} the remains of some walls could still then be seen. A bath-house was found in 1815 when a farm cart accidentally fell into part of a hypocaust. The ruins did not fare well under the early 19th century occupants of Binchester Hall. In 1828, [...] "altars, urns, and other relics" [...] were robbed out and taken away to be used as props inside coal pits in the area. The fort and surrounding land passed from private ownership to that of the Anglican Church in 1836.|$|R
