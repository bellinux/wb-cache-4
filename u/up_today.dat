25|$|Great Danes have {{naturally}} floppy, triangular ears. In the past, when Great Danes were {{commonly used}} to hunt boars, cropping of the ears was performed to make injuries to the dogs' ears less likely during hunts. Now that Danes are primarily companion animals, cropping is sometimes still done for traditional and cosmetic reasons. In the 1930s when Great Danes had their ears cropped, after the surgery, two devices called Easter bonnets were fitted to their ears to make them stand <b>up.</b> <b>Today,</b> the practice is common in the United States, but much less common in Europe. In some European countries such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark, and Germany, and parts of Australia and New Zealand, the practice is banned or controlled to only be performed by veterinary surgeons.|$|E
25|$|Genealogy of Grigoriy Zhukovsky, Odessa citizen, {{attributed}} to the poet Vasily Andreyevich Zhukovsky (1783-1852).

As per Soviet school program from the 1950s and up to {{second part of the}} 1980s or beginning of the 1990s the father of this poet was the landlord Andrey Grigoriyevich Zhukovsky (died in 1817) and as per legend his father was the landlord Afanasiy Ivanovich Bunin (1716—1791) and the mother was the captive Turkish girl Salha, she was named by Christian name Yelizaveta Dementiyevna Tutchaninova. Their illegitimate boy, as per legend, was adopted by the landlord Andrey Grigoriyevich Zhukovsky and named Vasiliy Andreyevich Zhukovsky. Turkey joined the NATO in 1952 and in the 1960s or earlier the NATO was able to watch and listen to the Northern part of the Black Sea, including Odessa. It is why Turkish girl Salha was included in the legend. The landlord Andrey Grigoriyevich Zhukovsky, the father of poet, had Polish family name Zhukovsky and the landlords with this family name left in the Eastern Prussia before Swedish and then German invasion in the Eastern Prussia. It is why Soviet Intelligence wished to present Zhukovsky family in Odessa as representatives of Prussian Zhukovsky family branch. To avoid any person of Zhukovsky family in Odessa began thinking about the Royal title, the legend of the Bunin family was introduced. And it was done successfully. During the rule of Mikhail Gorbachev this legend was presented as the correct version to stop this Intelligence activity.|$|E
