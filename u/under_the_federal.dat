Studies have shown it to be moderately susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback.|$|E

5|$|Outraged by {{news of the}} defeat, Washington urged Congress {{to raise}} an army capable of {{conducting}} a successful offense against the Indian confederacy, which it did in March 1792establishing additional Army regiments (the Legion of the United States), adding three-year enlistments, and increasing military pay. The following month the House of Representatives conducted investigative hearings into the debacle.

Afterward, Congress passed two Militia Acts: the first empowered the president to call out the militias of the several states; the second required that every free able-bodied white male citizen of the various states, {{between the ages of}} 18 and 45, enroll in the militia of the state in which they reside.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also a}} {{significant}} diversity of salmonids present in the bay. Steelhead populations in California have dramatically declined due to human and natural causes; in the Bay Area, all naturally spawned anadromous steelhead populations below natural and manmade impassable barriers in California streams from the Russian River to Aptos Creek, and the drainages of San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun Bays are listed as threatened <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Endangered Species Act. The Central California Coast coho salmon population is the most endangered of the many troubled salmon populations {{on the west coast}} of the United States, including populations residing in tributaries to the San Francisco Bay. Industrial, mining, and other uses of mercury have resulted in a widespread distribution of that poisonous metal in the bay, with uptake in the bay's phytoplankton and contamination of its sportfish.|$|E

5|$|Banksia verticillata {{has been}} {{declared}} vulnerable <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, and Rare under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. A 1995 census yielded an estimated total population size of 4500 plants. Apart from dieback and aerial canker, frequency of bushfires and illegal picking have been cited as threats. Ongoing management includes monitoring of current populations, gathering more data on best response to fire, and restricting access to populations. Seed has been collected from many populations, but germination rates after ten years of storage are much lower than in Banksia brownii. Translocation is considered an option in the future, as is spraying with phosphite, particularly {{in the vicinity of}} Walpole. Used successfully on B.brownii but as yet untrialled with B.verticillata, phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. Aerial spraying of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed as studies have shown that foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth.|$|E
5|$|Elected {{with support}} from the Farmers' Alliance {{and as a result of}} {{agricultural}} protest, Tillman was thought likely to join the Populists in their challenge to the established parties. Tillman refused, and generally opposed Populist positions that went beyond his program of increasing access to higher education and reform of the Democratic Party (white supremacy was not a Populist position). The Alliance (and Populists) demanded a system of subtreasuries <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government, that could accept farmers' crops and advance them 80 percent of the value interest-free. Tillman, not wanting more federal officeholders in the state (that in Republican administrations might be filled by African Americans), initially opposed the proposal. Many farmers felt strongly about this issue, and in 1891, Tillman was censured by the state Alliance for his opposition. Attuned to political necessities, Tillman gradually came to support the subtreasuries in time for his re-election campaign in 1892, though he was never an active proponent.|$|E
5|$|The first coroner's inquest into Smith's suicide {{began in}} May 2011. The inquest, {{initially}} led by deputy chief coroner Dr. Bonita Porter, was controversial; {{it was originally}} scheduled to begin in November 2010, but was delayed by a legal challenge by the Smith family. As {{a result of this}} challenge, the scope of the inquest was broadened to cover the entire 11-month period of Smith's incarceration <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> Correctional Service. Further, a panel of judges with the Ontario Divisional Court ruled in May 2011 that Dr. Porter should not have excluded video evidence of Smith's forced sedation at the Joliette Institution in Quebec. On 21 June 2011, the proceedings of the inquest were suspended until 12 September; the reason for the delay was apparently to allow the proceedings to be webcast. In late June 2011, Dr. Porter was replaced as the presiding coroner, apparently due to her impending retirement in November 2011; the replacement presiding coroner was Dr. John R. Carlisle. The sudden and unexpected replacement led Smith's family to formally accuse the chief coroner of interfering in the inquest with no legal basis; Dr. Porter had apparently indicated that she would deliver three outstanding rulings in July, days before the announcement of her replacement. The inquest resumed briefly on 12 September, only to be suspended once again until 19 September, when the Smith family lawyer challenged the right of the new coroner to continue the inquest, and called for a mistrial. On 30 September 2011, the Ontario Coroner's Office formally terminated the inquest and dismissed the jury.|$|E
