25|$|Yonge soon was at sea again. During {{this period}} he {{undertook}} several voyages with the Newfoundland fisheries. The first was in May 1663 when aged 16, he took {{passage in the}} ship Reformation. Yonge spent time on land and <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> between settlements, making sketches and observations on the industry. In January 1666, during the Second Dutch War, his ship, the Bonaventure was captured by the Dutch and he was shackled together with other prisoners, for fifty one days. (The biography of the Victorian writer Charlotte Yonge by Christabel Coleridge refers to Yonge being a galley slave of the Moors, possibly conflating {{the time he was}} a Dutch prisoner with the fact that he did serve off Algiers whilst in the Navy.) In September 1666 he was exchanged for a relative of the secretary of the Dutch Admiralty, who was a prisoner at Harwich.|$|E
25|$|In the Dunjonmaster program, {{the screen}} is divided into a {{birds-eye}} view representation of the surroundings and a status summary for the character. Traps, treasures and secret doors are hidden inside the dungeons. Temple of Apshai uses a hybrid between a turn-based and a real time combat system. A player's turn can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> up to 9 steps in the direction the character is facing, turning towards either direction, trying to talk the monster out of the fight, or executing {{a number of different}} attacks. A bow and arrows can be used to attack enemies from afar. If the player doesn't make any input for a while, the enemies continue to move and attack in set intervalls regardless. All actions decrease the player character's fatigue rating, depending on stats and carrying weight. When this value sinks below zero, the character cannot act anymore before resting. The player gains experience points while adventuring, which raise a number of hidden statistics.|$|E

He <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> alone at night looking for new friends, even {{at the peak of}} his musical popularity. The 1980s saw him become deeply unhappy; Jackson explained, [...] "Even at home, I'm lonely. I sit in my room {{sometimes}} and cry. It's so hard to make friends... I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night, just hoping to find someone to talk to. But I just end up coming home." ...|$|E

He operated the scenic drive until his death in 1976, charging $2 per car (equivalent to $ in [...] ) at the end.|$|E
500|$|In July, Dylan {{appeared}} at the second Newport Folk Festival. That weekend, Peter, Paul and Mary's rendition of [...] "Blowin' in the Wind" [...] reached number two on Billboards pop chart. Baez was also at Newport, appearing twice on stage with Dylan. The combination of the chart success of [...] "Blowin' in the Wind", and the glamor of Baez and Dylan singing together generated excitement about Dylan and his new album. Tom Paxton recalled: [...] "That was a big breakout festival for Bob. The buzz kept growing exponentially {{and it was like}} a coronation of Bob and Joan. They were King and Queen of the festival". His friend Bob Fass recalled that after Newport, Dylan told him that [...] "suddenly I just can't walk around without a disguise. I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> around and go wherever I wanted. But now it's gotten very weird. People follow me into the men's room just so they can say that they saw me pee." ...|$|E
500|$|Earlier, when roads did not exist, people <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> {{or travel}} by animal-drawn {{vehicles}} or carriages along beaten tracks to reach Puri. Travel was by riverine craft along the Ganges up to Calcutta, {{and then on}} foot or by carriages. It was only during the Maratha rule that the popular Jagannath Sadak (Road) was built around 1790. The East India Company laid the rail track from Calcutta to Puri, which became operational in 1898. Puri is now well-connected by rail, road and air services. A broad gauge railway line of the South Eastern Railways which connects Puri with Calcutta, and Khurda is an important railway junction on this route. The rail distance is about [...] from Calcutta and [...] from Vishakhapatnam. Road network includes NH 203 that links the city with Bhubaneswar, the state capital, situated about [...] away. NH 203 B connects the city with Satapada via Brahmagiri. Marine drive, {{which is part of}} NH 203 A, connects Puri with Konark.

2500|$|In 1008, {{a terrible}} famine brought the Plague. According {{to the local}} tradition, the Virgin Mary held a cordon around the city which, miraculously, has since {{protected}} its people from the disease. Since then, every year at that time, the Valenciennois <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> around the [...] road round the town, in {{what is called the}} tour of the Holy Cordon. Many Counts succeeded, first as Margraves of Valenciennes and from 1070 as counts of Hainaut.|$|E
2500|$|Although Emerson did not own {{a record}} player, he enjoyed {{listening}} to music on the radio, particularly Floyd Cramer's 1961 slip note-style [...] "On the Rebound" [...] {{and the work of}} Dudley Moore. He used jazz sheet music from Dave Brubeck and George Shearing and learned about jazz piano from books. He also listened to boogie-woogie, and to country-style pianists including Joe [...] "Mr Piano" [...] Henderson, Russ Conway and Winifred Atwell. Emerson later described himself: [...] "I was a very serious child. I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> around with Beethoven sonatas under my arm. However, I was very good at avoiding being beaten up by the bullies. That was because I could also play Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard songs. So, they thought I was kind of cool and left me alone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many of {{her other}} {{photographs}} containing her nude or hurt children caused controversy. For example, in [...] "The Perfect Tomato," [...] the viewer sees a nude Jessie, posing on a picnic table outside, bathed in light. Jessie told Steven Cantor during the filming {{of one of his}} movies that she had just been playing around and her mother told her to freeze, and she tried to capture the image in a rush because the sun was setting. This explains why everything is blurred except for the tomato, hence the photograph's title. This image was likely criticized for Jessie’s nudity and presentation of the adolescent female form. While Jessie was aware of this photograph, Dana Cox, in her essay, said that the Mann children were probably unaware of the other photographs being taken as Mann’s children were often naked because “it came natural to them.” This habit of nudity is a family thing because Mann says she <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> around her house naked when she was growing up. Cox states that “the own artist’s childhood is reflected in the way she captures moments in her children’s lives.” One image that deals more with another aspect of childhood besides [...] "naked play", Jessie's Cut, shows Jessie's head, wrapped in what appears to be plastic, with blood running down the side of her face from the cut above her left eye. The cut is stitched and the blood is dry and stains her skin. As painful as the image looks, there are a great number of viewers who could relate to Jessie when they think about the broken bones and stitched up cuts they had during childhood.|$|E
50|$|Later, Alosha's {{mother has}} sold their {{apartment}} and workers begin dismantling wall hangings and appliances {{left behind in}} the now vacant apartment. Outside on the street, missing person posters of Alyosha now canvas large parts of the city trying to seek help in locating the missing boy. The scene shifts to the nearby river by the wooded path which Alyosha <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> home after school and the view focuses on an extended landscape scene looking through naked winter branches of the surrounding very tall trees. The tree branches sway slightly against the winter sky with no sight of Alyosha or anyone else among the naked winter branches against the winter sky.|$|R

5000|$|According to Ibn 'al-Adim: The atebeg was violent, powerful, awe-inspiring and {{liable to}} attack suddenly… When he rode, the troops <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> {{behind him as}} if they were between two threads, out of fear they would trample over crops, and nobody out of fear dared to trample on a single stem (of them) nor march his horse on them… If anyone transgressed, he was crucified.
