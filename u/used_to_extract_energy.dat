50|$|The {{key to a}} {{practical}} jet engine was the gas turbine, <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> <b>energy</b> from the engine itself to drive the compressor. The gas turbine was not an idea developed in the 1930s: the patent for a stationary turbine was granted to John Barber in England in 1791. The first gas turbine to successfully run self-sustaining was built in 1903 by Norwegian engineer Ægidius Elling. Limitations in design and practical engineering and metallurgy prevented such engines reaching manufacture. The main problems were safety, reliability, weight and, especially, sustained operation.|$|E
50|$|Most {{piston engines}} have a hot exhaust that still {{contains}} considerable undeveloped energy {{that could be}} used for propulsion if extracted. A turbine is often <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> <b>energy</b> from such a stream of gases. A conventional gas turbine is fed high-pressure, high-velocity air, extracts energy from it, and leaves as a lower-pressure, slower-moving stream. This action has the side-effect of increasing the upstream pressure, which makes it undesirable for use with a piston engine as it has the side-effect of increasing the back-pressure in the engine, which decreases scavenging of the exhaust gas from the cylinders and thereby lowers the efficiency of the piston portion of a compound engine.|$|E
30|$|After sizing and {{simulating}} a ground-coupled {{heat pump}} system with various GHE configurations, the pumping power was calculated for U-pipe and coaxial GHEs and compared to one another. The Darcy-Weisbach equation was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> calculate head loss through piping under a worst-case scenario, i.e., when the viscosity of water is higher at lower temperatures. Those conditions are expected during each heating season when the GHEs are <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> <b>energy</b> from the subsurface and the water temperature in the GHEs decreases. The pumping power was then calculated by multiplying the water flow rate and density, the gravitational acceleration and the head loss through all the GHEs.|$|R

50|$|Though {{the details}} of the {{aerodynamics}} depend very much on the topology, some fundamental concepts apply to all turbines. Every topology has a maximum power for a given flow, and some topologies are better than others. The method <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> power has a strong influence on this. In general, all turbines may be grouped as being either lift-based, or drag-based; the former being more efficient. The difference between these groups is the aerodynamic force that is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> the <b>energy.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Rotating {{black holes}} have {{surfaces}} where the metric {{appears to have}} a singularity; {{the size and shape of}} these surfaces depends on the black hole's mass and angular momentum.

Fi- nally we look into ways to create a particle capable to escape to infinity with as big energy as possible using Compton scattering and annihilation. The biggest energy found is approximately 14 times the energy of the incoming particles. The efficiency decreases with the distance from the horizon and with the decreasing specific angular momentum of the black hole. ...|$|E
40|$|The Cauchy {{problem is}} {{considered}} for the scalar wave equation in the Kerr geometry. We prove that by choosing a suitable wave packet as initial data, one can extract energy from the black hole, thereby putting supperradiance, the wave analogue of the Penrose process, into a rigorous mathematical framework. We quantify the maximal energy gain. We also compute the infinitesimal change of mass and angular momentum of the black hole, in agreement with Christodoulou’s result for the Penrose process. The main mathematical tool is our previously derived integral representation of the wave propagator. 1 Introduction and Statement of Results Near a rotating black hole there is the counter-intuitive effect that the physical energy of particles or waves need not be positive.

50|$|All wind {{turbines}} <b>extract</b> <b>energy</b> {{from the wind}} through aerodynamic forces. There are two important aerodynamic forces: drag and lift. Drag applies a force on {{the body in the}} direction of the relative flow, while lift applies a force perpendicular to the relative flow. Many machine topologies could be classified by the primary force <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> the <b>energy.</b> For example, a Savonious wind turbine is a drag-based machine, while a Darrieus wind turbine and conventional horizontal axis {{wind turbines}} are lift-based machines. Drag-based machines are conceptually simple, yet suffer from poor efficiency. Efficiency in this analysis is based on the power extracted vs. the plan-form area.

40|$|Power {{generation}} {{schemes that}} could be used downhole in an oil well to produce about 1 Watt average power with long-life (decades) are actively being developed. A variety of proposed energy harvesting schemes could be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> <b>energy</b> from this environment but each of these has their own limitations that limit their practical use. Since vibrating piezoelectric structures are solid state and can be driven below their fatigue limit, harvesters based on these structures are capable of operating for very long lifetimes (decades); thereby, possibly overcoming a principle limitation of existing technology based on rotating turbo-machinery. An initial survey identified that spline nozzle configurations can be used to excite a vibrating piezoelectric structure {{in such a way as}} to convert the abundant flow energy into useful amounts of electrical power. This paper presents current flow energy harvesting designs and experimental results of specific spline nozzle/ bimorph design configurations which have generated suitable power per nozzle at or above well production analogous flow rates.

40|$|To {{predict the}} effect of a {{floating}} viscoelastic slab on the propagation and attenuation of gravity waves, a theoretical linear model has been developed. The slab has been modeled as a Kelvin-Voigt model and the fluid is assumed to be ideal. For long and short wave theory a dispersion relation for gravity waves covered by a viscoelastic slab of infinite length has been derived. This dispersion relation has been used to compute the so-called transmission and reflection coefficients of a slab of finite length. The theoretically derived dispersion relation has been checked by tests on a slab made of butyl rubber and polystyrene. These tests have been carried out for regular waves in a wave flume having the dimensions of 20 * 0. 5 * 0. 6 meter. The slab had a thickness of 11. 5 mm and a length of 4. 27 meter. Using the measured wave heights, the transmission and reflection coefficients were calculated and compared with the theoretical values. Notwithstanding the made assumptions, the measurements agree fairly weil with the theoretical values. The presented theory can be used to investigate the wave attenuation, the wave reflection and the absorption of wave energy by a floating viscoelastic slab. Such a slab may be used to attenuate waves (in harbors or applications offshore) or it may be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> <b>energy</b> from waves.

40|$|Informed by LES {{data and}} resolvent {{analysis}} of the mean flow, we examine the structure of turbulence in jets in the subsonic, transonic, and supersonic regimes. Spectral (frequency-space) proper orthogonal decomposition is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> <b>energy</b> spectra and decompose the flow into energy-ranked coherent structures. The educed structures are generally well predicted by the resolvent analysis. Over a range of low frequencies and the first few azimuthal mode numbers, these jets exhibit a low-rank response characterized by Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) type wavepackets associated with the annular shear layer {{up to the end}} of the potential core and that are excited by forcing in the very-near-nozzle shear layer. These modes too the have been experimentally observed before and predicted by quasi-parallel stability theory and other approximations [...] they comprise a considerable portion of the total turbulent energy. At still lower frequencies, particularly for the axisymmetric mode, and again at high frequencies for all azimuthal wavenumbers, the response is not low rank, but consists of a family of similarly amplified modes. These modes, which are primarily active downstream of the potential core, are associated with the Orr mechanism. They occur also as sub-dominant modes in the range of frequencies dominated by the KH response. Our global analysis helps tie together previous observations based on local spatial stability theory, and explains why quasi-parallel predictions were successful at some frequencies and azimuthal wavenumbers, but failed at others.

40|$|We {{consider}} a two dimensional compressible flow around an open cavity. The Flow around a cavity is characterised by a self-sustained mechanism {{in which the}} shear layer impinges on the downstream edge of the cavity resulting in an acoustic feedback mechanism which must be reduced. Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of the flow at a representative Reynolds number has been carried to obtain pressure and velocity fields, both for the case of unactuated and multi frequency actuation. These fields are then <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> <b>energy</b> ranked coherent structures also called as the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) modes. A Reduced Order Model is constructed by a Galerkin projections of the isentropic compressible equations. The model is then extended to include the effect of control. To avoid the divergence of the model while integrating in time various calibration techniques has been utillized. A new method of calibration which minimizes a linear functional of error, based on modal sensitivity is proposed. The calibrated low order model is used to design a feedback control of the Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) type, coupled with an observer. For the experimental implementation of the controller, a state estimate based on the observed pressure measurements at 6 different locations, is obtained through a Linear Stochastic Estimation (LSE). The optimal control obtained is periodic with a frequency corresponding to the second Rossiter mode of the cavity. Finally the control obtained is introduced into the DNS to obtain a decrease in spectra of the cavity acoustic mode...|$|E

This paper proposes to study the relation between electrooculogram (EOG) and video analysis for blink detection and characterization. An original method to detect and characterize blinks from a video analysis is presented here. The method uses different filters based on the human retina modelling. A illumination robust filter is first used to normalize illumination variations of the video input. Then, Outer and an Inner Plexiform Layer filters are <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> <b>energy</b> signals from eye area. The eye detection is processed mixing gradient and projection methods which makes it able to detect even closed eyes. The illumination robust filter {{makes it possible to}} detect the eyes even in night conditions, without using external lighting. The video analysis extracts two signals from the eye area measuring the quantity of static edges and moving edges. Blinks are then detected and characterized from these two signals. A comparison between the features extracted from the EOG and the same features extracted from the video analysis is then performed on a database of 14 different people. This study shows that some blink features extracted from the video are highly correlated with their EOG equivalent: the duration, the duration at 50 %, the frequency, the percentage of eye closure at 80 % and the amplitude velocity ratio. The frame rate influence on the accuracy of the different features extracted is also studied and enlightens on the need of a high frame rate camera to detect and characterize accurately blinks from a video analysis...|$|E
