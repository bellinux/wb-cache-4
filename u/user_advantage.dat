A melody data file producing device produces data files from the conveyed analysis melody in a preset file format i. e. mobile ring tone file format, when a user of a mobile phone accepts the given analysis melody. A melody data file supplying device provides files for the user. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (A) a method of sending signaling melody to a user (B) a computer program with a program code for executing a method of sending signaling melody to a user. USE - Used for sending a signaling melody e. g. ring tone, to a mobile phone <b>user.</b> <b>ADVANTAGE</b> - The system enables the user to flexibly and easily receive a signaling melody e. g. ring tone, created by him in his mobile against payment, by using Internet service...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an efficient multiplexing and error control system to improve streaming video performance over path aggregates. While providing the application with increased aggregate bandwidth, the scheme reduces performance degradation {{due to high}} path latencies and loss rates. The reduction in effective loss and delay is achieved by smart multiplexing and exploiting the high latency paths to the <b>user's</b> <b>advantage.</b> A novel out-of-order transmission algorithm utilizes the higher latency paths to transfer suitable frames from within the transmit buffer. We present an FEC strategy for our scheme that decouples the transmission of error correction frames from the associated data. This provides protection against correlated losses. Our scheme, while not completely optimized, can provide close to optimal performance at a considerably lower complexity. We verify the performance of our scheme using the ns- 2 simulator...|$|R
5000|$|So on 4 November 1957, {{with an eye}} to the {{imminent}} [...] general election, the National government announced that [...] State Highway 6 between Blenheim and Nelson would be deemed by law to be a 'notional railway', connecting {{with the rest of the}} South Island network at Blenheim. Various points on the highway were designated as stations. This meant that passenger fares and freight rates from any railway station in the South Island to designated stations on the notional railway, or to Nelson, were calculated as if there was continuous railway mileage between the two points, even though in reality passengers or freight travelling on the notional railway were transported by road carriers. As rail rates for both passengers and freight were significantly cheaper than road carrier rates, this was obviously to the <b>user's</b> <b>advantage.</b>|$|R

40|$|There are {{numerous}} ways to describe Distributed Data Processing (DDP) structures and their associated characteristics of functional distribution components and <b>user</b> <b>advantages</b> and disadvantages. However, {{the bulk of}} the literature concerning DDP deals with its evolutionary impact and excludes consideration of the key generic characteristics of DDP and how these characteristics relate to user complexity, responsiveness, and user productivity. ^ Therefore, this study was undertaken to analyze generic Distributed Data Processing structures and their advantages and disadvantages. In addition, it described the homogeneous and heterogeneous characteristics of representative DDP environments. During this process, a range of expected DDP models were developed and test case assessments between these hypothesized DDP models and real environments were matched. ^ For this study a comprehensive examination of related readings, professional interviews, case studies, and DDP experiments conducted by the writer were integrated to provide an insight into DDP structures and the changing business environment caused by this new DDP technology. ^ The study 2 Ì† 7 s principal conclusion is that Distributed Data Processing may be defined in multiple forms (models) of structural configuration and user functional characteristics. Further, these multiple forms are not homogeneous, that is, a more powerful DDP form is not a natural or logical multiplier of a simpler form. The forms are heterogeneous and may be distinguished from each other by their unique <b>user</b> <b>advantages</b> and disadvantages. ^ Finally, the study concluded that DDP represents an important business opportunity, and is here to stay as a meaningful and effective data processing option. Further, DDP will introduce a new spectrum of user data processing function, but will also introduce unanticipated system complexity as a consequence for users. Moreover, the study determined that, in some cases, DDP was wrought with inefficiency and complications because it was used with abandon. Therefore, data processing executives and professionals should be cognizant to recognize the characteristics of DDP models and their respective options, and then, determine, very specifically, the appropriate environment and associated model that best suits their organization 2 Ì† 7 s objectives. ...|$|R

40|$|To {{understand}} better how <b>users</b> take <b>advantage</b> of wireless networks, we examine a twelve-week {{trace of a}} building-wide local-area wireless network. We analyze the network for overall user behavior (when and how intensively people use the network {{and how much they}} move around), overall network traffic and load characteristics (observed throughput and symmetry of incoming and outgoing traffic), and traffic characteristics from a user point of view (observed mix of applications and number of hosts connected to by users). Amongst other results, we find that users are divided into distinct location-based sub-communities, each with its own movement, activity, and usage characteristics. Most users exploit the network for web-surfing, session-oriented activities and chatoriented activities. The high number of chat-oriented activities shows that many <b>users</b> take <b>advantage</b> of the mobile network for synchronous communication with others. In addition to these user-specific results, we find that pea [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} the Adopted-Pet (AP) protocol, an automatic (i. e. requiring no human interaction) secure pairing protocol, adequate for the pairing between a passive RFID tag and a reader. Most pairing protocols rely for their security {{on a certain}} advantage that the legitimate devices have over any malicious <b>users.</b> Such <b>advantages</b> include proximity (employing near-field communication) or secret keys that are either produced with the assistance of, or verified by, the legitimate <b>user.</b> The <b>advantage</b> exploited by our novel AP protocol {{is the amount of}} uninterrupted time spent by the two devices in the proximity (although not requiring near-field communication) of each-other. We discuss several implementation configurations, all based on pseudo-random bit generators, employing short-length LFSRs, and requiring no more than 2000 transistors. This makes the protocol ideally suited for low-cost passive RFID tags. For each configuration we show that the AP protocol is highly secure against occasional malicious entities...|$|R

40|$|In the {{distribution}} of water among users {{in the state of}} Utah there is lack of organizational uniformity. On some rivers, the state engineer is assisted by river sommissioners who have been appointed to measure and monitor water deliveries. On other rivers there are no comissioners; problems and disputes must be settled on a case by case basis by the state engineer. The responsibilities, arrangements, salaries, and methods of payment for commissioners vary from basin to basin. A more unifed distribution organization composed of state-employed water sommissioners would have several advantages over the existing system of commissioners employed by local water <b>users.</b> <b>Advantages</b> would include the development and retantion of a higher level of expertise, improved record keeping and reporting, more complete geographical coverage of river systems, and better balance of commissioner work loads.
