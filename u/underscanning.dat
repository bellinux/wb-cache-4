The study showed that both near surface liquid segregationbands and subsurface porosity strongly affected the fracture behaviour. Dominant for loss ofductility was gross centre porosity.

Foram analisadas as resistências à tração da união após os tratamentos, assim como, emmicroscopia eletrônica de varredura (MEV), as características morfológicas das estruturas formadas na região da união dentina-compósito; a morfologia da superfície produzida pelos tratamentos utilizados para preparar a dentina e opadrão de fratura dos espécimes testados no ensaio de microtração. Foram utilizados 208 terceiros molares humanos, que tiveram a superfície oclusal removida para a exposição de dentina de profundidade {{superficial}} e foram divididos aleatoriamente em 32 grupos experimentais. As tecnologias de preparo cavitário foram: ausência de smear layer, abrasionamento com lixas de SiC 600, ponta diamantada (100 ?m),broca carboneto de tungstênio (10 lâminas), aplicaçãode jato de óxido de alumínio 271 ?m,aplicação de laser Er:YAG, ponta diamantada CVD em ultra-som e Carisolv®. Após o tratamento superficial foi aplicado um dos sistemas adesivos de acordo com as instruções dos fabricantes (Tyrian, ClearfilSE Bond, Unifil Bond e Single Bond), em seguida restaurados com o compósito Clearfil AP-X. Os dentes foram armazenados em água destilada a 3 rC durante 24 horas. Após esse período, os dentes foram seccionados perpedicularmente ainterface de união, nos sentidos mésio-distal e vestíbulo-lingual, com a finalidade de se obter palitos com área de secção transversal de 0, 7 mm 2. Os espécimes foram testados com o ensaio de microtração numa velocidade de 0, 5 mm/min até aruptura. Os resultados foram analisados com ANOVA dois-critérios e teste Tukey. Foi identificada uma interação entre os tratamentos e os sistemas adesivos (p< 0, 00003). O tratamento com o laser de Er:YAG na condição do experimento ea ponta diamantada CVD em ultra-som apresentaram os piores resultados para todos os sistemas. O Carisolv® apresentou valores de resistência de união intermediários, porém os adesivos autocondicionantes mostraram resultadosinferiores ao Single Bond. A ponta diamantada, a broca carboneto de tungstênio e a lixa de SiC 600 mostraram os resultados semelhantes. A abrasão a ar proporcionou maiores valores de resistência de união para o Clearfil SE Bond queapresentou resultado superior ao Tyrian. Os sistemas Clearfil SE Bond e Single Bond foram superiores, obtendo os maiores valores na ausência de smear layer, no entanto, o Unifil Bond foi semelhante ao Single Bond. As análises em MEVrevelaram variações na formação da camada híbrida e uma predominância do padrão de fratura com falha adesiva entre o sistema de união e a dentina, e parcialmente coesiva no sistema de união. Foi observado que existe uma fortedependência entre as tecnologias utilizadas para a realização dos preparos cavitários e os sistemas de união, porém a técnica do condicionamento com ácido fosfórico pode reduzir o efeito das tecnologias sobre a resistência de união, excetopela aplicação do laser de Er:YAG e da ponta diamantada CVD em ultra-somAbstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the effect of alternative cavity preparation techniques on the adhesive procedures with self-etching adhesive systems. Microtensile bond strength tests (?TBS), as well as, analysis <b>underscanning</b> electron microscope (SEM) of the morphological characteristics of the bonded structures, treated dentin surfaces and the failure mode of the tested specimens were performed. 208 third human molars had their oclusal surfaceflattened in order to expose superficial dentin. Teeth were randomly assigned to 32 experimental groups. Cavity preparation techniques used in this study were: smear layer free surface, 600 -grit SiC paper, diamond bur (100 ?m,) carbide bur (10 blades), air abrasion, Er:YAG laser, CVD diamond bur - sonoabrasion and Carisolv® gel. Following each surface treatment, adhesive systems (Tyrian, Clearfil SE Bond, Unifil Bond and Single Bond) were applied according to manufacturer'sinstructions and 6 mm high blocks were incrementally built up with Clearfil AP-X (Kuraray) composite resin. The specimens were stored for 24 hours at 37 °C in distilled water and were serially sectioned in both mesio-distal and buccal-lingualdirections transversally to the bonded interface to obtain an array of bonded beams with a cross-sectional area of 0. 7 mm 2. Beams were tested in tension (0. 5 mm/min - Instron 4411) and results were analyzed with two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test. Itwas found an interaction between adhesive systems and surface treatments (p< 0. 00003). Sonoabrasion and laser treatment yielded the lowest values for the tested adhesive systems; Carisolv® gel showed intermediate bond strength, however, self-etching adhesive systems were worse than Single Bond.

Clearfil SE Bond and Single Bond were superior, obtaining the highest values of ?TBS for the smear layer free surface, although in the comparison among the adhesive systems Unifil Bond and Single Bond were similar. SEM analysis revealed some variations in the hybrid layer formation and the predominance of an adhesive failure between adhesive system and dentin, and partially cohesive in the adhesive system. It was also observed that there is a strong relationship between cavity preparation techniques and adhesive systems, however, the total-etch technique seems to levei the effect over the ?TBS, except for the Er:YAG laser treatment and sonoabrasio...|$|E

50|$|Many 1980s 8-bit home {{computers}} feature gutterboxing display mode, because the TV screens normally used as monitors {{at that time}} tended to distort the image near {{the border of the}} screen, {{to such an extent that}} text displayed in that area became illegible. Moreover, due to the overscanned nature of television video, the precise edges of the visible area of the screen varied from television set to television set, so characters near the expected border of the active screen area might be behind the bezel or off the edge of the screen. The Commodore 64, VIC-20, and Commodore 128 (in 40-column mode) featured coloured gutterboxing of the main text window, while the Atari 8-bit family featured a blue text window with a black border. The original IBM PC CGA display adapter was the same, and the monochrome MDA, the predecessor of the CGA, as well as the later EGA and VGA, also featured gutterboxing; this is also called <b>underscanned</b> video. The Fisher-Price PXL-2000 camcorder of the late 1980s recorded a windowboxed image to compensate partially for low resolution.|$|R
