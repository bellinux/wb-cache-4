50|$|An {{investor}} typically 'buys a call' when {{he expects}} {{the price of the}} <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> will go above the call's 'strike price,' hopefully significantly so, before the call expires. The investor pays a non-refundable premium for the legal right to exercise the call at the strike price, meaning he can purchase the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> at the strike price. Typically, if the price of the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> has surpassed the strike price, the buyer pays the strike price to actually purchase the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument,</b> and then sells the instrument and pockets the profit. Of course, the investor can also hold onto the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument,</b> if he feels it will continue to climb even higher.|$|R
50|$|An {{investor}} typically 'writes a call' when {{he expects}} {{the price of the}} <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> to stay below the call's strike price. The writer (seller) receives the premium up front as his or her profit. However, if the call buyer decides to exercise his option to buy, then the writer has the obligation to sell the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> at the strike price. Often the writer of the call does not actually own the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument,</b> and must purchase it on the open market {{in order to be able}} to sell it to the buyer of the call. The seller of the call will lose the difference between his purchase price of the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> and the strike price. This risk can be huge if the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> skyrockets unexpectedly in price.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} both separating audio mixtures into sound sources and identifying the musical instruments of the sources. A statistical tone model of the power spectrogram, called an integrated model, is defined and source separation and <b>instrument</b> <b>identification</b> are carried out {{on the basis of}} Bayesian inference. Since, the parameter distributions of the integrated model depend on each instrument, the instrument name is identified by selecting the one that has the maximum relative instrument weight.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to <b>instrument</b> <b>identification</b> based on individual partials is presented. It makes identification possible even when the concurrently played instrument sounds have {{a high degree of}} spectral overlapping. A pairwise comparison scheme which emphasizes the specific differences between each pair of instruments is used for classification. Finally, the proposed method only requires a single note from each instrument to perform the classification. If more than one partial is available the resulting multiple classification decisions can be summarized to further improve <b>instrument</b> <b>identification</b> for the whole signal. Encouraging classification results have been obtained in the <b>identification</b> of four <b>instruments</b> (saxophone, piano, violin and guitar).

5000|$|A {{covered call}} is a {{financial}} market transaction {{in which the}} seller of call options owns the corresponding amount of the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument,</b> such as shares of a stock or other securities. If a trader buys the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> {{at the same time}} the trader sells the call, the strategy is often called a [...] "buy-write" [...] strategy.

50|$|Futures are {{preferred}} by professionals for indices and interest rate trading over CFDs {{as they are}} a mature product and are exchange traded. The main advantages of CFDs, compared to futures, is that contract sizes are smaller making it more accessible for small trader and pricing is more transparent. Futures contracts tend to only converge near to the expiry date compared {{to the price of}} the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> which does not occur on the CFD as it never expires and simply mirrors the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument.</b>|$|R

50|$|An {{asset class}} {{is a group}} of {{instruments}} which have similar financial characteristics and behave similarly in the marketplace. We can often break these instruments into those having to do with real assets and those having to do with financial assets. Often, assets within the same asset class are subject to the same laws and regulations; however, this is not always true. For instance, futures on an asset are often considered part of the same asset class as the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> but are subject to different regulations than the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{price of}} the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument,</b> in {{whatever}} form, is paid before control of the instrument changes. This {{is one of the}} many forms of buy/sell orders where the time and date of trade is not the same as the value date where the securities themselves are exchanged. Forwards, like other derivative securities, can be used to hedge risk (typically currency or exchange rate risk), as a means of speculation, or to allow a party to take advantage of a quality of the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> which is time-sensitive.|$|R

50|$|The main {{difference}} between financial betting and speculation on financial markets using {{products such as}} financial spread betting is that the bet must result in a simple binary win or loss based on an event on the <b>underlying</b> financial <b>instruments.</b> This triggers a fixed payout for a win, while with spread betting the payout or loss varies with the price level of the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument.</b>|$|R
50|$|More specifically, TV {{reflects}} {{the probability that}} the option will gain in IV — become (more) profitable to exercise before it expires. An important factor is the option's volatility. Volatile prices of the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument</b> can stimulate option demand, enhancing the value. Numerically, this value depends on the time until the expiration date and the volatility of the <b>underlying</b> <b>instrument's</b> price. TV of American option cannot be negative (because the option value is never lower than IV), and converges to zero at expiration. Prior to expiration, the change in TV with time is non-linear, being a function of the option price.|$|R

Experiment 1 assessed the ability to identify the instrument playing each note, while experiments 2 and 3 assessed the ability to discriminate the different stimuli.

When multiple instruments simultaneously play, partials (harmonic components) of their sounds overlap and interfere, which makes the acoustic features different from those of monophonic sounds. To cope with this, we weight features based on how much they are affected by overlapping. First, we quantitatively evaluate the influence of overlapping on each feature as the ratio of the within-class variance to the between-class variance in the distribution of training data obtained from polyphonic sounds. Then, we generate feature axes using a weighted mixture that minimizes the influence via linear discriminant analysis. In addition, we improve <b>instrument</b> <b>identification</b> using musical context.
