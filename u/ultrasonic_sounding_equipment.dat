40|$|Measurement of {{acoustic}} emission (AE) during {{laboratory experiments}} – rock sample loading - {{is an important}} tool for study of material mechanical properties as well as understanding of modes of its failure. For correct data processing {{it is necessary to}} calibrate used AE sensors; the calibration constants can depend on property of individual sensors, on their contact conditions, etc. As there can be a deformation induced charge in sensor contact condition, the calibration constants may vary with time. AE sources can be modeled (in the same way as natural earthquakes) as double couple sources with use of moment tensor (MT) formalism (3 x 3 symmetric tensor, i. e. 6 independent values, the problem is linear).

40|$|Abstract-Multi-input multi-output (MIMO) {{radio channel}} {{sounders}} commonly employ time-division multiplexing (TDM) techniques to switch between {{the elements of}} the transmit and receive antenna arrays. However, phase noise of the local oscillators in the transmitter and the receiver of a TDM MIMO channel sounder can significantly affect the accuracy of estimates of relevant channel parameters, such as the channel capacity and the parameters of propagation paths. In this paper we derive a new SAGE algorithm for path parameter estimation that compensates for the effect of phase noise. Monte Carlo simulations show that the new algorithm always outperforms the traditional SAGE algorithm [21, 131 and that it is able to practically mitigate this effect, provided the phase noise variance is below a certain threshold. The general conclusion is that the new SAGE algorithm is able to compensate for the effect of phase noise in practical channel <b>sounding</b> <b>equipments,</b> provided the used sounding sequences are sufficiently short.

The depth of water at a site can be determined from charts or by using the depth <b>sounding</b> sonar <b>equipment</b> that is standard equipment on ships.

40|$|Measuring depth at sea in {{the early}} nineteenth century was a {{complicated}} affair. A single sounding event could take many hours and required the ship’s position to be accurately estimated throughout the duration of the investigation. Bad weather moved ships off course and curtailed sounding events in mid-flow. Overestimations were commonplace when underwater currents dragged the lead horizontally through the water, whilst the crewmen on board ship continued to pay out the line. To add to these difficulties was the issue of instrumentation: no one sounding device was universally agreed upon to provide reliable results. As a consequence the representation of the deep sea changed dramatically as the nineteenth century progressed. Whilst much has been written of Maury’s first bathymetric maps, this paper focuses on the lesser explored area of depth recording during the Arctic expeditions of Captains John Ross, William Parry and John Franklin. Testing of new scientific equipment was also one of the key goals of early nineteenth century polar expeditions organised and funded by the British Admiralty. I suggest in this thesis that the reason one piece of <b>sounding</b> <b>equipment</b> became favoured over another was its ease of use by the crew on board ship. I go on to consider Bruno Latour’s idea of transcriptions, and argue that rather than using sounding maps at this time as immutable mobiles, the expedition captains were forced to perform new soundings all the time, and construct new maps of the polar seas as they experienced them. This thesis draws on Actor-Network theory to suggest soundings in the Polar Regions at this time were part of a wider of network of scientific investigation and navigation, and that no network of technology, men and representations were constructed strong enough to withstand the dissociating forces of the polar seas and adverse weather at this point in time...|$|R
40|$|As an open cast mine {{reaches its}} {{economic}} limit {{many companies are}} deciding to leave a void up against the final high wall which subsequently fills up with water and deposited material. Sedimentation and deposited material build up in flooded open cast mine workings and is not being accounted for in the future mine plan and cost modelling phase of these areas. To understand this anomaly of additional overburden removal and pumping requirements, a bathymetric sounding survey is required so that overburden and coal extraction productivity rates can be more accurately determined. Bathymetry data can be collected using {{a wide variety of}} sensors including: lead lines, single beam and multi beam acoustic depth sounders, as well as airborne laser sensors, but are usually collected as a series of cross section lines. Bathymetric techniques will be analysed to determine whether inexpensive bathymetric equipment coupled with Real Time Kinematic (RTK) Global Positioning System (GPS) technology can provide a high level of precision, accuracy and what effect different transect and point spacing have on the accuracy of the volumes of deposited material. Only lead line, single and multi beam acoustic techniques will be considered due to the remoteness and cost constraints for this project.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Arctic lakes {{can provide}} a {{long-term}} perspective on environmental change, including trends in long-range atmospheric transport and deposition of contaminants, inferred from studies of sediment cores. In this study, we conducted the first detailed bathymetric survey of Lake Hazen (Quttinirpaaq National Park, Ellesmere Island, Nunavut), the world’s largest lake north of 74 ˚ latitude. With these data {{we were able to}} determine optimal locations for sediment coring and to collect and analyze profundal sediment cores. A bathymetric map of Lake Hazen was developed on the basis of 362 spot soundings obtained with GPS-coupled <b>sounding</b> <b>equipment</b> placed directly on the ice combined with additional soundings from a small boat. The deepest point in the lake (81 4 ̊ 9. 5 ʹ N; 70 4 ̊ 2. 8 ʹ W) was found to be 267 m deep. The lake volume was estimated to be 5. 14 × 1010 m 3, about 10 % larger than previous estimates. Using estimates of the discharge of Lake Hazen from the Water Survey of Canada, we estimated the water retention time to be 89 years. Sediment cores were dated using 210 Pb and 137 Cs. Sedimentation rates at the deep point, estimated using the Constant Rate of Supply model for excess 210 Pb, were relatively high (1260 g m- 2 yr- 1) in the period 2005 – 1963 and lower (650 ± 100 g m- 2 yr- 1) in horizons dated to 1950 – 1880. The majority of elements measured in sediment (24 of 29 consistently above detection limits), as well as organic carbon, showed less than 20 % variation in concentrations in the top 10 cm (compacted depth), which represent deposition over approximately 140 years. Geochemical characteristics of the sediment suggest that erosional inputs from annual glacial melting are the major source of essentially all elements and that anthropogenic inputs from long-range transport of toxic metals such as mercury and lead are very low...|$|R
40|$|Abstract : The {{first record}} by <b>ultrasonic</b> echo <b>sounding</b> on the {{distribution}} of the submerged standing trees on the bottom of Lake Onogawa is presented. Lake Onogawa is a dammed lake formed {{at the time of the}} eruption of the volcano Mt. Bandai in 1888. Since then the original vegetation of the dammed valley has remained submerged. Many submerged standing trees are distributed on the bottom within about 600 m from the northeast end of the lake. The density of the trees in this area is sufficient to call thema submerged lake grove. The trees are sparsely distributed on the bottom of the central part of the lake, where residential and cultivated land of the submerged Onogawa Village had been located. There are no submerged trees on the bottom of the shallow southwest part of the lake, where the mudflows seems to have been deposited. The vast surface of the submerged trees may serve as substrates and substrata for attached algae, bacteria, fungi and other organisms. The respiration of these attached organisms may accelerate the oxygen consumption, which in turn may accelerate many other anoxic processes such as denitrification, manganese and iron reductions. 　Key words : Lake Onogawa, dammed lake, submerged trees, ultrasonic echo soundin...|$|R
40|$|Many marine {{scientists}} and {{users of the}} sea consider knowledge of the sea bottom as basic data, a mere context {{to carry out research}} or deploy activities. Some disciplines do need more accurate bathymetric data than others, depending on depth values being background information or crucial information for their research or activities. In bathymetry, the representation of the sea bottom surface is the main objective and hence, this discipline will try to render the sea bottom relief as accurate as possible. The latest bathymetric <b>sounding</b> <b>equipment</b> that is available nowadays, especially the multibeam echosounder, yield a very dense bottom sampling. When compared to the common singlebeam echosounder, an enormous amount of data is produced that needs to be processed in a correct and fast way. Grid-overlay (by local linear or more sophisticated interpolation and attributing values to individual grid cells) is not an option here as this method uses an interpolation of the measured values and hence will either cause accuracy loss or generate a still larger amount of data. A triangular irregular network (TIN for short), especially the Delaunay triangulation (Dt), does respect the actual measurements and will not generate new data. In literature, a number of algorithms have been developed that determine the Dt of a set of points (vertices) given in the plane. A performant divide-and-conquer algorithm for Delaunay triangulations was implemented to triangulate large quantities of data in minimum time. Comparison with other implemented algorithms demonstrates its excellent performance. In some cases, {{it will be necessary to}} adapt the terrain model. Theoretical terrain models (for instance design models for marine contractors) require manual interventions, while new surveys partially overlapping old data will have to replace the latter. Therefore, the incremental algorithm has been adapted to allow insertion of individual points. When eliminating individual vertices, the hole thus created has to be retriangulated. Vertices belonging to a triangulation that is (partially) covered by a new surveyed area can be eliminated and using a very keen adaptation of the divide-and-conquer principle, the overlapping triangulations can be stitched together. This is a novel technique with the big advantage of quickly and seamlessly joining two large triangulations, without the need for retriangulation of the entire area. Part of the immense amount of data generated by a multibeam echosounder will unavoidably be redundant. An important issue therefore will be: filtering these data, keeping those points that still assure an optimal accuracy. This accuracy can be expressed as a function of the topography or as a function of the volume. For the latter, not the height difference determines whether or not a vertex is allowed in the triangulation, the criterion is rather the change in volume caused by this one vertex. For marine contractors, it is mainly the latter that is important. A hybrid model would be most adequate...|$|R
