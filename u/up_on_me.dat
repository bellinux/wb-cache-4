500|$|In {{his major}} league debut with the Houston Astros on September 14, 1991, he went 3-for-4 {{with a double}} and scored three runs against the Cincinnati Reds. He hit [...]203 in 20 games for the {{remainder}} of the Astros' regular season. With Steve Finley already entrenched as Houston's centerfielder, and aged 26 years, Lofton was traded during the off-season to the Cleveland Indians for catcher Eddie Taubensee and right-handed pitcher Willie Blair. [...] "I know they gave <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> and now I'm glad they did. One man's trash is another man's treasure", Lofton said of the Astros trading him.|$|E
500|$|Giant Bomb's Jeff Gerstmann {{reviewed}} Fallout: New Vegas for the Xbox 360 positively, {{despite its}} many crash bugs and glitches. Gerstmann wrote: [...] "When I {{reflect on the}} experience, I'll probably think about the times the game locked <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> or broke in a dozen other crazy ways first, before thinking about the great world and the objectives that fill it. If {{you were able to}} look past the issues that plagued Fallout 3 and Oblivion before it, New Vegas will eventually show you a real good time." [...] 1UP.com's Mike Nelson wrote [...] "On one hand, it feels like I can recommend this to any fan of the Fallout series. I single these fans out because they're willing to forgive silly bugs like meeting characters who walk into walls or occasionally float in mid-air. These fans realize that the game as a whole is greater than the sum of minor graphical anomalies. [...] On the other hand, I simply can't ignore or forgive the game for crashing on me when I walk around the Mojave Wasteland; or for quests that simply can't be completed because of a game glitch; or for making my companions disappear when I need them the most during a battle. These {{are some of the most}} frustrating bugs I have ever encountered with any game, especially when attached to a series that I deeply enjoy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elena {{suffered}} a serious injury when a bone detached itself from her knee. A medical specialist {{told her that}} her injury could be repaired through surgery. Her chances of ever again competing at the highest level would be negligible. In fact it could mean she would never be a gymnast again. Elena took plenty of rest and homeopathic treatments. Her resilience and spirit won through. [...] "When I was injured my coach believed in me and didn't give <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>me.</b> In my mind I knew I could still be on the team. I kept going." ...|$|E

60|$|The resentment {{that had}} simmered <b>up</b> in <b>me</b> <b>on</b> his behalf now boiled over against him. I {{looked at him}} in silence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not exactly. At least, he didn't mean to. You {{should have}} got a smarter man before you ventured to put <b>up</b> a bluff <b>on</b> <b>me.</b> Still, that's not the question. When {{are you going to}} bring my horses back?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2002, Waits {{simultaneously}} released two albums, Alice and Blood Money. Both collections {{had been}} written almost 10 years previously and were based on theatrical collaborations with Robert Wilson; the former a musical play about Lewis Carroll, and the latter an interpretation of Georg Büchner's play fragment Woyzeck. Both albums revisit the tango, Tin Pan Alley, and spoken-word influences of Swordfishtrombones, while the lyrics are both profoundly cynical and melancholic, exemplified by [...] "Misery is the River of the World" [...] and [...] "Everything Goes to Hell." [...] "Diamond in Your Mind", which Waits wrote for Wilson's Woyzeck, did not appear on Blood Money; however, it did emerge on Solomon Burke's album Don't Give <b>Up</b> <b>on</b> <b>Me</b> of the same year. While Waits has played the song live a number of times, an official version would not be released until 2007.|$|E
2500|$|Machine Translations' next album, Seven Seven, {{appeared}} in October 2007. Zuel finds Walker is [...] "as unfussy a musician {{as you could}} find" [...] and provides a [...] "feeling of great calm" [...] where [...] "hings happen but they happen naturally". Dan Rule of The Age felt it was [...] "stunningly organic" [...] as Walker [...] "weaves a shimmering layer of acoustic nuance and texture throughout". Walker composed the score and Machine Translations contributed to the soundtrack for ABC-TV drama series East of Everything (March 2008 – September 2009). Walker's [...] "A Most Peculiar Place" [...] {{was used as the}} show's theme: it had originally appeared on Machine Translations' album, Happy. Walker has a cameo as a singer-songwriter in episode five where he performs [...] "Don't Give <b>Up</b> <b>on</b> <b>Me</b> Just Yet". At the APRA Music Awards of 2008 Walker was nominated for Best Soundtrack Album for East of Everything Series One Soundtrack Album.|$|E
2500|$|Thompson {{took off}} again, and Andreotta {{reported}} that Mitchell was now executing {{the people in}} the ditch. Furious, Thompson flew over the northeast corner of the village and spotted a group of about ten civilians, including children, running toward a homemade bomb shelter. [...] Pursuing them were soldiers from 2nd Platoon, Charlie Company. [...] Realizing that the soldiers intended to murder the Vietnamese, Thompson landed his aircraft between them and the villagers. [...] Thompson turned to Colburn and Andreotta and told them that if the Americans began shooting at the villagers or him, they should fire their M60 machine guns at the Americans: [...] "Y'all cover me! [...] If these bastards open <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> or these people, you open up on them. [...] Promise me!" [...] Colburn (whose M60 faced 2nd Platoon) replied, [...] "You got it boss, consider it done." [...] He turned his weapon to face the American soldiers and exchanged stares with them, but privately was uncertain if he could actually fire on his fellow countrymen. [...] Thompson then dismounted to confront 2nd Platoon's leader, Lieutenant Stephen Brooks. [...] Thompson told him he wanted help getting the peasants out of the bunker: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That unknown, {{approaching}} thing, seemeth ever ill, my brother, {{which must}} have unfrank heralds to go before. Oh, Pierre, dear, dear Pierre; be very careful with me! This strange, mysterious, unexampled love between us, makes me all plastic in thy hand. Be very careful with me. I know little out of me. The world seems all one unknown India to <b>me.</b> Look <b>up,</b> look <b>on</b> <b>me,</b> Pierre; say now, thou wilt be very careful; say so, say so, Pierre!" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{flashed a}} swift glance of reproach <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>me.</b> To my amazement {{there were tears}} in her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Too safe," [...] Isadora's husband objected. [...] "Of course, {{with younger}} lions, {{the work and}} {{responsibility}} piles <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>me.</b> But we've got to make our living, and this turn's about busted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jim," [...] {{the other}} said with seriousness, [...] "it's a hangin' matter. I fixed 'm. I had to. He woke <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>me.</b> You an' me's {{got to do}} some layin' low for a spell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One morning I got up, and I {{found my}} clothes all covered with dirt and cobwebs and my shoes very muddy. I couldn't explain this, and I thought {{some of the}} fellows had been putting <b>up</b> a job <b>on</b> <b>me.</b> But I didn't {{want to play the}} calf, so I said nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Buck up, laddie!" [...] he roared encouragingly. [...] "I had {{anticipated}} this. Something seemed {{to tell me}} that your nerve would go {{when it came to the}} point. You're deuced lucky, old horse, to have a man like me at your side. Why, if you were alone, you wouldn't have a word to say for yourself. You'd just gape at the man and yammer. But I'm with you laddie, I'm with you. If your flow of conversation dries <b>up,</b> count <b>on</b> <b>me</b> to keep the thing going." ...|$|R
60|$|Then, {{followed}} by their rough and mocking laughter, I {{broke away from}} them, and took refuge in my wagon, little guessing that all this talk would be brought <b>up</b> against <b>me</b> <b>on</b> a day to come.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because you crept <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>me,</b> {{there is}} no reason why the red snakes can do the same thing!" [...] I cried angrily, whereupon he nodded gravely as if agreeing with me, after which he asked: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How can I tell? He seemed {{just about}} as much struck <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>me.</b> Anyway, he paid me as much {{attention}} as he did her. Perhaps it's more the way, now, to notice the mother than it used to be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{went dead}} back on me after I started the fire, an' Bill Dean says they told Sam Barney all about it. If Sam would only let <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> I'd show that I {{could be as}} square {{as any of the}} fellers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. I reckon she {{was about}} sixteen. A pretty girl with big, soft eyes. I offered to take her <b>up</b> behind <b>me</b> <b>on</b> my hoss. An' they all wanted her to come. But she wouldn't.... I hate to think--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When I got back," [...] went on Cleve, [...] "my {{girl had}} married another fellow. She'd given him all I left with her. Then I got drunk. While I was drunk they put <b>up</b> a job <b>on</b> <b>me.</b> It was her word that disgraced me and run {{me out of}} town.... So I struck west and drifted to the border." ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{was on the}} 4 September session that, {{according}} to McCartney, Martin suggested using a harmonica. However, Lennon's harmonica part was present on the Anthology 1 version of the song recorded during the 6 June audition with Pete Best on drums. Also, Martin's own recollection of this is different, saying: [...] "I picked <b>up</b> <b>on</b> 'Love <b>Me</b> Do' because of the harmonica sound", adding: [...] "I loved wailing harmonica—it {{reminded me of the}} records I used to issue of Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee. I felt it had a definite appeal." ...|$|R

5000|$|Taïa wrote a {{piece for}} The Guardian in December 2010 about Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who, “formerly {{the richest man in}} his country, was accused of tax fraud in 2003 and has been languishing in a Siberian prison for seven years. His crime? To have wanted for his country a true democracy, as well as genuine respect for human rights.... Since 2003, this intelligent, romantic, {{wonderful}} man is my only hero. He is far from perfect but his battle, which he refuses to give <b>up</b> <b>on,</b> touches <b>me</b> deeply. Russia and the world need him.” ...|$|R
