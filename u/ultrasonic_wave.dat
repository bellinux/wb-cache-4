50|$|<b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>wave</b> nebulizers {{were invented}} in 1964 {{as a new}} type of {{portable}} nebulizer. The technology inside an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>wave</b> nebulizer is to have an electronic oscillator generate a high frequency <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>wave,</b> which causes the mechanical vibration of a piezoelectric element. This vibrating element is in contact with a liquid reservoir and its high frequency vibration is sufficient to produce a vapor mist. As they create aerosols from ultrasonic vibration instead of using a heavy air compressor, they only have a weight around 170 g. Another advantage is that the ultrasonic vibration is almost silent. Examples of these more modern type of nebulizers are: Omron NE-U17 and Beurer Nebulizer IH30.|$|E

40|$|The acousto-optic {{interaction}} affords {{a convenient}} way of optically probing <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>waves</b> in medical diagnosis and nondestructive evaluation. The effects of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>waves</b> {{on the light}} transmitting through transparent media arise from the refractive index variations produced by <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>waves.</b> The index variations may be detected by optical deflection, diffraction or interference methods [1 – 4]. In Raman-Nath regime, the acoustic waves act as a moving phase grating and diffract the light into different orders. Schlieren visualisation derived from this mechanism has been extensively used to ultrasonic measurements in liquids. In solid media, the acousto-optic effects become more complicated because of the induced optical birefringence.
