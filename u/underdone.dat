25|$|Lee seemed <b>underdone</b> in the 2008 Australian {{tour of the}} West Indies, taking only 5 wickets in {{the first}} Test match, during which he seemed exhausted. He {{returned}} to productivity, taking eight wickets in the Second test, including a 5 wicket haul, and 6 in the Third Test.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{forms of}} magic and spiritual {{possession}} were also advanced as causes in literature. In nineteenth century Europe, {{the vagaries of}} diet {{were thought to be}} responsible. For example, in Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol, Ebenezer Scrooge attributes the ghost he sees to [...] "... an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an <b>underdone</b> potato..." [...] In a similar vein, the Household Cyclopedia (1881) offers the following advice about nightmares: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{harvested}} pods are opened, typically with a machete, {{to expose}} the beans. The pulp and cocoa seeds are removed and the rind is discarded. The pulp and seeds are then piled in heaps, placed in bins, or laid out on grates for several days. During this time, the seeds and pulp undergo [...] "sweating", where the thick pulp liquefies as it ferments. The fermented pulp trickles away, leaving cocoa seeds behind to be collected. Sweating {{is important for the}} quality of the beans, which originally have a strong, bitter taste. If sweating is interrupted, the resulting cocoa may be ruined; if <b>underdone,</b> the cocoa seed maintains a flavor similar to raw potatoes and becomes susceptible to mildew. Some cocoa-producing countries distill alcoholic spirits using the liquefied pulp.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Dan, I'm not--but Billie can't a-bear meat <b>underdone,</b> so it's {{better to}} blacken the outside than have the inside raw." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Underdone</b> meat is {{an abomination}} to some, a luxury to others--reminding {{one of that}} very ancient proverb, [...] "Tastes differ." [...] We cannot say whether on this {{occasion}} the uniformity of action in our heroes {{was the result of}} taste or haste, but certain it is that before the fowls were only half-roasted on one side, they were turned over so as to let the fire get at the other, and breakfast was begun while the meat was yet frightfully <b>underdone.</b>|$|E
60|$|Fiorsen stared fixedly at that {{perfectly}} shaped face, where a faint, <b>underdone</b> pink {{mingled with}} {{the fairness of the}} skin. Was she mocking him? Impossible! She looked too matter of fact.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{care about}} my quail on toast being <b>underdone</b> for breakfast," [...] said Stacy, with a yawn; [...] "and you needn't serve with red wine. I'm not feeling very peckish this morning." ...|$|E
60|$|ELISABETTA (close to table). Here's a fine fowl for my lady; I had scant {{time to do}} him in. I hope he be not <b>underdone,</b> for we {{be undone}} in the doing of him.|$|E
6000|$|The moral thus doth glibly run-- [...] A cause its {{opposite}} may brew; [...] The sun-shade is unlike the sun, [...] The plum unlike the plumber, too. [...] A salamander <b>underdone</b> [...] His impudence may overdo.|$|E
60|$|TANNER. Oh, {{the tiger}} will love you. There is no love sincerer than {{the love of}} food. I think Ann loves you that way: she patted your cheek {{as if it were}} a nicely <b>underdone</b> chop.|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{delightful}} to be {{flirted with}} again!" [...] she sighed. [...] "And I thought all German men were so heavy, and paid elaborate, <b>underdone</b> compliments. Still, your secret, sir, please? That is what I want to know." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{thought was}} checked abruptly, for he {{suddenly}} {{remembered that he}} had a burning-glass in his trousers pocket. He might perhaps be able to roast them with that--in a somewhat <b>underdone</b> fashion, no doubt--still, any sort of cooking would be better than none! ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was a week}} or {{two later}} that the parlour-maid gave notice, having been terrified almost to tears by an {{outbreak}} of sudden temper {{on the part of the}} master anent some <b>underdone</b> cutlets. [...] "'E gnashed 'is teeth at me, 'e did reely," [...] she informed a sympathetic kitchen audience.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because," [...] said Scrooge, [...] "a {{little thing}} affects them. A slight {{disorder}} {{of the stomach}} makes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an <b>underdone</b> potato. There's more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "G-guess they'll do," [...] said Jethro, as {{he folded}} them up. He was too generous not to indulge, for once, {{in a little}} well-deserved praise. [...] "Hain't <b>underdone</b> it, and hain't {{overdone}} it a mite hev you? M-man of resource. Callate you couldn't hev beat that if you was to take a week to it." ...|$|E
6000|$|The ex-baker {{would have}} fared far better, {{had it not}} been for his heart, which was soft and <b>underdone.</b> A kind word made a fool of him; and hence most of the scrapes he got into. Two or three wags, aware of his infirmity, used to [...] "draw him out" [...] in {{conversation}} whenever the most crabbed and choleric old seamen were present.|$|E
6000|$|On being carved, the mutton {{proved to}} be <b>underdone.</b> At other times, this was an unpardonable crime in Benjulia's {{domestic}} code of laws. All he said now was, [...] "Take it away." [...] He dined on potatoes, and bread and cheese. When he had done, he was rather more amiable than ever. He said, [...] "Ask the cook {{to come and see}} me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The bag {{turned out}} to be well filled with sweet {{potatoes}} boiled, cubes of salt beef and pork, and a famous sailors' pudding, what they call [...] "duff," [...] made of flour and water, and of about the consistence of an <b>underdone</b> brick. With these delicacies, and keen appetites, we went out into the moonlight, and had a nocturnal picnic.|$|E
60|$|Glad {{to escape}} from such stuffy quarters, Private Smith clambered out of his bunk and {{followed}} the other on deck. It was a fine clear night, and the schooner was going along under a light breeze; the seaman took the wheel, and, turning to his companion, abruptly inquired {{what he meant by}} deserting and worrying them with six foot four of <b>underdone</b> lobster.|$|E
60|$|He {{made his}} toilet {{in the wet}} under the pump outside; where he had to wait his turn. And he rather wished he were going back to St. Louis. He had an early breakfast of fried eggs and <b>underdone</b> bacon, and coffee which made him pine for Hester's. The dishes were neither too clean nor too plentiful, being doused in water as soon as ever {{they were out of}} use.|$|E
60|$|At {{one o'clock}} I rode over to Strickland's house to inquire after Fleete's head. I {{imagined}} {{that it would}} be a sore one. Fleete was breakfasting and seemed unwell. His temper was gone, for he was abusing the cook for not supplying him with an <b>underdone</b> chop. A man who can eat raw meat after a wet night is a curiosity. I told Fleete this and he laughed.|$|E
6000|$|I {{glanced at}} the list, and my stomach threw a hand-spring. Of all the barbarous lay-outs that were ever contrived, {{this was the most}} atrocious. At the top stood 'tough, <b>underdone,</b> overdue tripe, garnished with garlic;' half-way down the bill stood 'young cat; old cat; {{scrambled}} cat;' at the bottom stood 'sailor-boots, softened with tallow--served raw.' The wide intervals of the bill were packed with dishes calculated to gag a cannibal. I said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The sun {{had just}} gone down; {{and it was a}} lovely sunset, and the sky looked like a great, {{beautiful}} slice of <b>underdone</b> beef; and I said so to him, and he said, sniffily, that he was afraid he didn't see the resemblance. And I asked him if he wasn't starving. And he said no, because as a rule all that he needed was a little ripe fruit. And that was when I hit him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "About {{two weeks}} later comes shearing-time. The sheep had to be driven up to the ranch, {{and a lot of}} frowzy-headed Mexicans would snip the fur off of them with back-action scissors. So the {{afternoon}} before the barbers were to come I hustled my <b>underdone</b> muttons over the hill, across the dell, down by the winding brook, and up to the ranch-house, where I penned 'em in a corral and bade 'em my nightly adieus.|$|E
6000|$|One night, I {{ordered a}} bottle of mulled wine at an hotel where I was staying, and {{waited a long time}} for it; at length it was put upon the table with an apology from the {{landlord}} that he feared it wasn't 'fixed properly.' And I recollect once, at a stage-coach dinner, overhearing a very stern gentleman demand of a waiter who presented him with a plate of <b>underdone</b> roast-beef, 'whether he called THAT, fixing God A'mighty's vittles?' ...|$|E
60|$|And then Lord Greystoke {{wiped his}} greasy fingers upon his naked thighs {{and took up}} the trail of Kulonga, the son of Mbonga, the king; while in far-off London another Lord Greystoke, the younger brother of the real Lord Greystoke's father, sent back his chops to the club's CHEF because they were <b>underdone,</b> {{and when he had}} {{finished}} his repast he dipped his finger-ends into a silver bowl of scented water and dried them upon a piece of snowy damask.|$|E
6000|$|I {{know of no}} modern European {{composer}} {{so difficult}} to eat beefsteak to as Wagner. That we did not choke ourselves is a miracle. Wagner's orchestration is most trying to follow. We {{had to give up}} all idea of mustard. B. tried to eat a bit of bread with his steak, and got most hopelessly out of tune. I am afraid I was a little flat myself during the [...] "Valkyries' Ride." [...] My steak was rather <b>underdone,</b> and I could not work it quickly enough.|$|E
60|$|With {{some trouble}} he got {{together}} a few sticks {{of wood and}} some moss which the sunshine had dried out, and soon he had a respectable blaze between two rocks. With his jackknife he cleaned the fish as best he could, and then broiled it on a green twig. When done the meat was slightly burnt {{on one side and}} <b>underdone</b> on the other, but to the half-famished lad nothing had ever tasted sweeter, and he continued to eat until the whole fish was gone.|$|E
6000|$|Louis talked vigorously of Virginia and Louisa--secretly marvelling how his hosts {{had brought}} {{themselves}} down to such fare. Isabel was dining without apparently seeing anything amiss, and James attempted {{nothing but a}} despairing toss of his chin, as he pronounced the carrots <b>underdone.</b> After the first course {{there was a long}} interval, during which Isabel and Louis composedly talked about the public meeting which he had been attending, and James fidgetted in the nervousness of hardly-restrained displeasure; but suddenly a frightful shrieking arose, and he indignantly cried, 'That girl!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, my own Dora,' said I, 'you {{are very}} childish, and are talking nonsense. You must remember, I am sure, that I {{was obliged to}} go out {{yesterday}} when dinner was half over; and that, the day before, I was made quite unwell by being obliged to eat <b>underdone</b> veal in a hurry; today, I don't dine at all--and I am afraid to say how long we waited for breakfast--and then the water didn't boil. I don't mean to reproach you, my dear, {{but this is not}} comfortable.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{seemed to}} be quite in earnest. It was four o'clock, and we had had breakfast at one; still, for a long time, he demanded those <b>underdone</b> chops. Then he changed into riding clothes and {{went out into the}} verandah. His pony--the mare had not been caught--would not let him come near. All three horses were unmanageable---mad with fear---and finally Fleete said that he would stay at home and get {{something}} to eat. Strickland and I rode out wondering. As we passed the temple of Hanuman, the Silver Man came out and mewed at us.|$|E
60|$|But today {{things of}} greater moment than the Sports {{occupied}} his mind. He had news. He had great news. He was bursting with news, and he hailed {{the approach of}} Tony and Welch with pleasure. With any other leading light of the School he might have felt less at ease, but with Tony it was different. When you have <b>underdone</b> a fellow's eggs and overdone his toast and eaten the remainder for a term or two, you begin to feel that mere social distinctions and differences of age no longer form a barrier.|$|E
60|$|Nicholas laughed, and {{entering}} no {{further into the}} subject of this lengthened harangue, reverted to the pleasant tone of the little birthday party. And as Mrs Nickleby instantly became very curious respecting it, and made a great number of inquiries touching what they had had for dinner, and how it was put on table, and whether it was overdone or <b>underdone,</b> and who was there, and what 'the Mr Cherrybles' said, and what Nicholas said, and what the Mr Cherrybles said when he said that; Nicholas described the festivities at full length, and also the occurrences of the morning.|$|E
6000|$|They {{weighed the}} merits of French cookery, modern {{international}} cookery, and produced alternatives. Trafford became very eloquent about old English food. [...] "Dinners," [...] said Trafford, [...] "should be feasting, not the mere satisfaction of a necessity. There should be--amplitude. I remember a recipe for a pie; I {{think it was in}} one of those books that man Lucas used to compile. If I remember rightly, it began with: 'Take a swine and hew it into gobbets.' Gobbets! That's something like a beginning. It was a big pie with tiers and tiers of things, and it kept it up all the way in that key.... And then what could be better than prime British-fed roast beef, reddish, just a shade on the side of <b>underdone,</b> and not too finely cut. Mutton can't touch it." ...|$|E
60|$|With {{an exclamation}} and a hurried glance around him, De Ferrières threw himself before the intruder. But slowly lifting his large hand, and placing {{it on his}} lodger's breast, he quietly overbore the sick man's feeble {{resistance}} with an impact of power that seemed almost as moral as it was physical. He {{did not appear to}} take any notice of the room or its miserable surroundings; indeed, scarcely of the occupant. Still pushing him, with abstracted eyes and immobile face, to the chair that Rosey had just quitted, he made him sit down, and then took up his own position on the pile of cushions opposite. His usually <b>underdone</b> complexion was of watery blueness; but his dull, abstracted glance appeared to exercise a certain dumb, narcotic fascination on his lodger.|$|E
6000|$|... "'I'm not,' says I. 'If I was, I'd knock {{some of the}} pallidness off of your marble brow. I'm lenient with you,' I says, 'just as I am {{with the}} Spaniards, because you have always {{reminded}} me of something with mushrooms on the side. Why, you little Lady of Shalott,' says I, 'you <b>underdone</b> leader of cotillions, you glassy fashion and moulded form, you white-pine soldier made in the Cisalpine Alps in Germany for the late New-Year trade, {{do you know of}} whom you are talking to? We've been in the same social circle,' says I, 'and I've put up with you because you seemed so meek and self-un-satisfying. I don't understand why you have so sudden taken a personal interest in chivalrousness and murder. Your nature's undergone a complete revelation. Now, how is it?' ...|$|E
