5|$|By 2000, {{development}} was <b>under</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> create pixellated camouflage patterns for battledress like the Canadian Forces' CADPAT, issued in 2002, {{and then the}} US Marines' MARPAT, rolled out between 2002 and 2004. The CADPAT and MARPAT patterns were somewhat self-similar (in the manner of fractals and patterns in nature such as vegetation), being designed to work at two different scales; a genuinely fractal pattern would be statistically similar at all scales. A target camouflaged with MARPAT takes about 2.5 times longer to detect than older NATO camouflage which worked at only one scale, while recognition, which begins after detection, took 20 percent longer than with older camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} shows the golden white-eye once also occurred on Tinian and Rota but was extirpated in those locations through {{the impact of}} human activities. Despite its current abundance on Saipan and Aguijan, {{and the fact that}} it has among the highest recorded densities for any bird, it is nevertheless considered to be critically endangered. It is threatened by the invasive brown tree snake, which has become established on nearby Guam, and this predator is expected to cause a rapid decline in the population if it reaches Saipan. Efforts are <b>under</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> control the snakes and breed the white-eye in zoos.|$|E

5|$|The Lord Howe Island {{stick insect}} {{disappeared}} from the main island soon after the introduction of rats in 1918.

The Lord Howe stag beetle is a colourful endemic beetle seen during summer months. Another endemic invertebrate, the Lord Howe flax snail (or Lord Howe Placostylus), has also been affected by the introduction of rats. Once common, the species is now endangered and a captive breeding program is <b>under</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> save the snail from extinction.|$|E

5|$|Hitler {{was deeply}} {{concerned}} that Ernst Röhm, {{the chief of}} the SA, was planning a coup. Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich plotted with Göring to use the Gestapo and SS to crush the SA. Members of the SA got wind of the proposed action and thousands of them took to the streets in violent demonstrations on the night of 29 June 1934. Enraged, Hitler ordered the arrest of the SA leadership. Röhm was shot dead in his cell when he refused to commit suicide; Göring personally went over the lists of detainees—numbering in the thousands—and determined who else should be shot. At least 85 people were killed in the period of 30 June to 2 July, which is now known as the Night of the Long Knives. Hitler admitted in the Reichstag on 13 July that the killings had been entirely illegal, but claimed a plot had been <b>under</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> overthrow the Reich. A retroactive law was passed making the action legal. Any criticism was met with arrests.|$|E
5|$|SR282 was {{initially}} designated in 1967 solely along Fourth Street from SR75 to the Naval Air Station; however, {{it was not}} to be in effect until the San Diego–Coronado Bridge was completed. Nevertheless, before the bridge opened, the designation was added in the 1968 legislative session, along with the portion of Orange Avenue from the Coronado Ferry landing to Fourth Street, which was to be removed once the Coronado Bay Bridge opened. The designation came into effect on February 21, 1969. In April, plans were <b>under</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> repave Fourth and Third Streets and add signals at the Orange Avenue intersections. The bridge opened on August 3, 1969.

5|$|To {{prevent any}} action against his testament's {{provisions}} for his son's succession and the regency, Theodore {{on his deathbed}} demanded an oath to be taken by Senate, army, people and clergy, both those present at court and those absent elsewhere in the state. Immediately after his death, George Mouzalon, aware of his vulnerability and his complete lack of support, called an assembly of the leading nobles, officials, and military commanders. He offered to resign from his post in favour of any person that the assembly chose, but the dignitaries, led by Michael Palaiologos, dissuaded him and encouraged him to stay on and even accepted {{to take an oath}} of loyalty to him {{as well as to the}} young emperor. It was a sham, as a conspiracy by the leading aristocratic families was well <b>under</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> depose him, in which Palaiologos apparently played a covert but leading role.|$|E
5|$|While {{plans were}} <b>under</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> secure {{funding for the}} {{restoration}} of the carousel, efforts were made to find some missing animals. By studying old photographs of the carousel, it was determined there had been three deer or stags which had not been found in the park district storage building. No one at the park district knew of their whereabouts, and some employees believed the animals had disintegrated. As well as the missing deer, two horses were missing. The museum contacted local newspapers, which published stories on the efforts to restore the carousel. The reports mentioned the missing animals, and that the museum was trying to locate them. An anonymous tip received in December 1973 revealed the deer were used in the annual Christmas Gift and Hobby Show, where they served as escorts for Santa Claus. Compton was able to secure the animals from the park district for the museum.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} {{nonetheless}} evaluated as critically endangered by the IUCN because {{the population is}} expected to undergo a rapid decline if the brown tree snake becomes established on Saipan. The primary threat to this species is the brown tree snake, a native of Australia, New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, which eliminated all 12 landbird species on nearby Guam after being accidentally introduced. The snake has not yet become established on Saipan, {{one of the two}} islands that compose the range of the golden white-eye, and which holds the largest population of the species. The isolation of Aguijan makes the introduction of brown tree snakes there unlikely, but the small population there is vulnerable as the island is only 718 ha (1774 acres) in size and a direct hit by a supertyphoon could wipe them out. Efforts are <b>under</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> breed the species in captivity and to prevent the snakes from being introduced and established on Saipan. Six zoos have recently received this species and breeding was expected to begin by 2011. Success came more quickly, and the first captive birds were bred in 2009 in the North Carolina Zoo. Birds from captive breeding will be introduced on new islands. In addition, 24 birds were translocated from Saipan to the island of Sarigan, a predator-free island reserve, in 2011 in the hope of establishing a breeding population.|$|E
