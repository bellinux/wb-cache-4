Since their introduction, oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE 5 Is) {{have been found to}} be highly effective and well tolerated, and are available as the first-line therapy for the treatment of ED. <b>Udenafil</b> is one of the selective PDE 5 Is made available in recent years for the treatment of ED. <b>Udenafil</b> has clinical properties of both relatively rapid onset and long duration of action due to its pharmacokinetic profile, thereby providing an additional treatment option for ED men to better suit individual needs. There is positive evidence that <b>udenafil</b> is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of ED of a broad spectrum of etiologies or severity. <b>Udenafil</b> is as effective in the treatment of diabetes mellitus-associated ED as other PDE 5 Is. Due to the clinical property of relatively long duration of action, <b>udenafil</b> may be another option in daily dosing treatment for ED, as suggested by its favorable efficacy and safety profile. Most adverse effects reported from clinical trials are mild or moderate in severity, without any serious adverse event, with headache and flushing being the most common. Also, the concomitant use of anti-hypertensive drugs or alpha- 1 -blockers does not significantly affect the efficacy and safety profile of <b>udenafil.</b> However, additional studies with larger cohorts including prospective, multicenter, comparative studies with patients of different ethnicities are needed to further validate the favorable findings of <b>udenafil</b> in the treatment of ED.

The aim of {{the study}} reported here was to investigate the pharmacokinetic drug interaction between <b>udenafil</b> and dapoxetine in healthy male subjects. Methods: An open-label, three-treatment, six-sequence, three-period crossover study was performed in healthy male subjects. In varying sequences, each subjects received single oral doses of <b>udenafil</b> 200 mg, dapoxetine 60 mg, and both treatments. The periods were separated by a washout period of 7 days. Serial blood samples were collected up to 48 hours after dosing. The plasma concentrations of <b>udenafil</b> and dapoxetine were determined using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained by non-compartmental analysis. Tolerability was assessed throughout the study. Results: Twenty-three healthy subjects completed the study. The geometric mean ratios of the area under the plasma concentration–time curve from time 0 to last measurable time point and measured peak plasma concentration for <b>udenafil</b> were 0. 923 (90 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 863 – 0. 987) and 0. 864 (90 % CI: 0. 789 – 0. 947), respectively. The geometric mean ratios of the area under the plasma concentration–time curve from time 0 to last measurable time point and measured peak plasma concentration for dapoxetine were 1. 125 (90 % CI: 1. 044 – 1. 213) and 0. 837 (90 % CI: 0. 758 – 0. 925), respectively. There were no serious adverse events reported, and none of the subjects dropped out due to adverse events.

40|$|We {{compared}} the efficacy and safety between once-daily dosing and on-demand use of <b>udenafil</b> for {{type 2 diabetic}} patients with erectile dysfunction (ED). A multi-center, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, 12 -week study was conducted. 161 patients who improved with on-demand 200 mg of <b>udenafil</b> according to Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) diary Question 2 and 3 (Q 2 and Q 3) were randomized into 200 mg on-demand (n = 80) or 50 mg once-daily (n = 81) dosing groups for 8 weeks. The dosing period {{was followed by a}} 4 -week treatment-free period. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) erectile function domain (EFD) score. The secondary efficacy endpoints included changes to the SEP diary Q 2, Q 3, IIEF Q 3, Q 4, other domains of IIEF, Global Assessment Question, and shift to the normal rate (EFD ?= 26). Vascular endothelial markers were also assessed. The IIEF-EFD score of both groups improved after 8 weeks of treatment (P ? 0. 0001). There was no statistically significant difference between two groups. Improvement was not maintained after the treatment-free follow-up period. Similar results were observed in the secondary efficacy endpoints. There was also no significant difference in vascular endothelial markers. Daily <b>udenafil</b> was well-tolerated, and {{there was no significant difference}} in the adverse drug reactions and adverse events between the two groups.

40|$|CONTEXT Erectile {{dysfunction}} (ED) is a {{major health}} care problem worldwide and phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE 5 Is) are the pharmacological treatment of choice. However, the optimal PDE 5 I for ED treatment is not known. OBJECTIVE To investigate trade-offs between efficacy and adverse events for various PDE 5 Is in treating ED. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION A review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement. Medline, Scopus, reference lists of relevant articles, and systematic reviews were searched. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials comparing at least one PDE 5 I for treating ED with placebo or another PDE 5 I. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS We included 82 trials (47 626 patients) for efficacy analysis and 72 trials (20 325 patients) for adverse event analysis. In the trade-off analysis of starting dosages, sildenafil 50 mg had the greatest efficacy but also had {{the highest rate of}} overall adverse events. Tadalafil 10 mg had intermediate efficacy but had the lowest overall rate of all adverse events. Vardenafil 10 mg and avanafil 100 mg had similar overall adverse events than sildenafil 50 mg but a markedly lower global efficacy. <b>Udenafil</b> 100 mg had similar global efficacy to that of tadalafil 10 mg but its overall adverse event rates were higher. CONCLUSIONS This is the first trade-off analysis of the different PDE 5 Is currently available. For individuals who prioritize high efficacy, sildenafil 50 mg appears to be the treatment of choice. Men wishing to optimize tolerability should take tadalafil 10 mg or switch to <b>udenafil</b> 100 mg in the case of insufficient efficacy.

40|$|Purpose: We {{analyzed}} the prescriptions of alpha-blockers and phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE 5 Is) in the urology department {{as well as}} in other departments of the general hospital. Methods: We investigated the frequency of prescription of alpha-blockers and PDE 5 Is from 3 general hospitals from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2009. For alpha-blockers, data were collected from patients to whom alpha-blockers were prescribed from among patients recorded as having benign prostatic hyperplasia according to the 5 th Korean Standard Classification of Diseases. For PDE 5 Is, data were collected from patients to whom PDE 5 Is were prescribed by the urology department and by other departments. Alpha-blockers were classified into tamsulosin, alfuzosin, doxazosin, and terazosin, whereas PDE 5 Is were classified into sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, <b>udenafil,</b> and mirodenafil. Results: Alpha-blockers were prescribed to 11, 436 patients in total over 3 years, and the total frequency of prescriptions was 68, 565. Among other departments, the nephrology department had the highest frequency of prescription of 3, 225 (4. 7 %), followed by the cardiology (3, 101, 4. 5 %), neurology (2, 576, 3. 8 %), endocrinology (2, 400, 3. 5 %), pulmonology (1, 102, 1. 6 %), and family medicine (915, 1. 3 %) departments in order.

40|$|Context: Several {{randomized}} controlled trials (RCTs) on phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE 5 -Is) have showed {{significant improvements in}} both lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and erectile dysfunction (ED) in men affected by one or both conditions, without {{a significant increase in}} adverse events. However, the results are inconsistent. Objective: Perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of available prospective and cross-sectional studies on the use of PDE 5 -Is alone or in combination with alpha 1 -adrenergic blockers in patients with LUTS/benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Evidence acquisition: A systematic search was performed using the Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases through September 2011 including the combination of the following terms: LUTS, BPH, PDE 5 -Is, sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, <b>udenafil,</b> alpha-blockers, and alpha 1 -adrenergic blocker. The meta-analysis was conducted according to the guidelines for observational studies in epidemiology. Evidence synthesis: Of 107 retrieved articles, 12 were included in the present meta-analysis: 7 on PDE 5 -Is versus placebo, with 3214 men, and 5 on the combination of PDE 5 -Is with alpha 1 -adrenergic blockers versus alpha 1 -adrenergic blockers alone, with 216 men. Median follow-up of all RCTs was 12 wk. Combining the results of those trials, the use of PDE 5 -Is alone was associated with a significant improvement of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) score (+ 5. 5; p < 0. 0001) and International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) (- 2. 8; p < 0. 0001) but not the maximum flow rate (Q(max)) (- 0. 00; p = not significant) {{at the end of the}} study as compared with placebo. The association of PDE 5 -Is and alpha 1 -adrenergic blockers improved the IIEF score (+ 3. 6; p < 0. 0001), IPSS score (- 1. 8; p = 0. 05), and Q(max) (+ 1. 5; p < 0. 0001) at the end of the study as compared with alpha-blockers alone. Conclusions: The meta-analysis of the available cross-sectional data suggests that PDE 5 -Is can significantly improve LUTS and erectile function in men with BPH. PDE 5 -Is seem to be a promising treatment option for patients with LUTS secondary to BPH with or without ED. (C) 2012 European Association of Urology. Published by Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of statins {{is related to}} the 'common soil' hypothesis, which proposes oxidative stress and inflammation as main pathophysiologic processes in the disease group of diabetes and endothelial dysfunction. This study evaluated the recovery of erectile function after administration of chronic statin alone in streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetes mellitus (DM) rats, focusing on the anti-oxidative effects and consequentially recuperated endothelial function. A total of 45 male Sprague-Dawley rats (8 weeks old) were divided into three groups (n = 15 each) : an age-matched normal control group (Control group), an uncontrolled DM group (DM group), and a statin-treated group (Statin group). The rats in the DM and Statin group received an injection of STZ (60 mg/kg). Beginning 10 weeks after the establishment of DM, the Statin group received daily treatment with atorvastatin (10 mg/kg) via oral gavage for four weeks. After 14 weeks, the results of the experiment were evaluated. The ratios of intracavernosal pressure (ICP) to mean arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded with cavernosometry (20 Hz, 3 V, 0. 2 msec for 30 seconds) before and after the intravenous administration of <b>udenafil</b> (1 mg/kg). Expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) was evaluated using cavernosal tissue. In addition, changes in RhoA translocation ratio and myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT 1) phosphorylation were evaluated with western blot. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were also analyzed as measurements of oxidative stress levels. The ICP/MAP and area under the curve (AUC) /MAP ratios of the Statin group were obviously superior to the DM group, but were not comparable to the Control group (P< 0. 001). The level of oxidative stress, namely SOD activity, was also significantly lower in the Statin group than in the DM group (P = 0. 015), and was comparable to the Control group. In contrast, MDA levels were not considerably different among the groups (P = 0. 217). The RhoA translocation ratio was not significantly different among the groups (P = 0. 668), whereas MYPT 1 phosphorylation in the Statin group was significantly lower than in the DM group (P = 0. 030), and similar to the Control group. Expression of α-SMA in the Statin group was higher than in the DM group (P< 0. 001), and comparable to the Control group. Chronic statin treatment alone showed anti-oxidative effects and helped to restore the erectile mechanism, but did not lead to the full recovery of erectile function in STZ-induced DM rats. Therefore, combination therapy rather than a single agent should be the preferred treatment strategy for DM-associated erectile dysfunction, especially in the setting of severe diabetes...|$|E
