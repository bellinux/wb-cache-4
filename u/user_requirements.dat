25|$|The {{most common}} for {{measuring}} functional size is function point analysis. Function point analysis measures {{the size of}} the software deliverable from a user's perspective. Function point sizing is done based on <b>user</b> <b>requirements</b> and provides an accurate representation of both size for the developer/estimator and value (functionality to be delivered) and reflects the business functionality being delivered to the customer. The method includes the identification and weighting of user recognizable inputs, outputs and data stores. The size value is then available for use in conjunction with numerous measures to quantify and to evaluate software delivery and performance (development cost per function point; delivered defects per function point; function points per staff month.).|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Studying <b>user's</b> varied <b>requirement,</b> {{composition}} of Web services {{becomes more and}} more important in order to fulfill user’s demand. The traditional systems of web services composition don't support variability of <b>user's</b> <b>requirement.</b> Therefore, introducing <b>user's</b> <b>requirement</b> into system of web services composition and extend the modules of composition system. In this paper, we deal with the issues of reconfigurable service modeling and efficient service composition decision making, design web services composition framework based on <b>user’s</b> <b>requirement,</b> and the composition module in detail. <b>User</b> <b>requirement</b> are read by defining the semantic information of web service, defining the <b>user</b> <b>requirement</b> provide trust for web services, extend the need to understand the exact attribute of web services in all aspects like, QoS Choreographies and Trust helps in Composition and Automation Framework for reconfiguration...|$|R

25|$|Both {{the current}} UK {{coalition}} {{government and the}} previous Labour Government expressed concerns about the rising costs of {{a survey of the}} whole population conducted once every ten years. Meanwhile, the accuracy and utility of a snapshot of the whole UK population once every ten years compared to continued surveying was being questioned. A rapidly changing society, evolving <b>user</b> <b>requirements</b> and new opportunities were emerging as drivers for change. These concerns and opportunities encouraged the UK Government to investigate alternative methods of population data collection; to identify the best way to provide small area population, and socio-demographic statistics in the future by taking advantages of the more advanced technology that is becoming available, and also to make use of existing sources of demographic data already being collected by the private sector.|$|E

Current researches on component retrieval are mostly limited to retrieve the component whose function is most close to the <b>user</b> <b>requirement.</b> However, {{in the process of}} component retrieval, we frequently face the problem that the individual component can’t completely meet <b>user’s</b> <b>requirement.</b> This paper proposes a method of composition of business components based on behavior, our purpose is to settle the problem that individual component can’t completely meet the <b>user</b> <b>requirement.</b> In this study, deterministic finite state machine is used for modeling the behavior specification of business component. The composition of business components can be represented as the product of deterministic finite state machines whose result can be regarded as a nondeterministic finite state machine. Therefore the problem of component retrieval can be transformed into the matching between nondeterministic finite state machine and deterministic finite state machine, and behavior mapping graph is used to check the existence of composition of business components. Through the composition of business components, we can extract the behaviors in accord with <b>user</b> <b>requirement</b> from a set of candidate business components, which increase the reuse degree and reduce the cost of software development...|$|R
