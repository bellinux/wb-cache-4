25|$|The {{octane rating}} of typical commercially {{available}} gasoline varies by country. In Finland, Sweden, and Norway, 95 RON {{is the standard}} for <b>regular</b> <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> and 98 RON is also available as a more expensive option. In the UK, ordinary <b>regular</b> <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> is 95 RON (commonly available), premium unleaded gasoline is always 97 RON, and super unleaded is usually 97–98 RON. However, both Shell and BP produce fuel at 102 RON for cars with high-performance engines and in 2006 the supermarket chain Tesco began to sell super unleaded gasoline rated at 99 RON. In the US, octane ratings in unleaded fuels can vary between 85 and 87 AKI (91–92 RON) for regular, through 89–90 AKI (94–95 RON) for mid-grade (equivalent to European regular), up to 90–94 AKI (95–99 RON) for premium (European premium).|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn the United States, the Emergency Planning and Community Right–to–Know Act {{requires}} {{sources that}} emit {{more than their}} Threshold Planning Quantity (TPQ) must publically report their total annual emissions. Because these values are aggregated over an entire year, high total emissions are often reported in the toxic release inventory. The Akwesasne Mohawk Reservation in rural Northern New York State lies downwind of an industrial source that reported annual benzene emissions of approximately 29 000 pounds. To assess if these emissions {{contributed significantly to the}} ambient concentrations, 24 hour canister samples were collected every 6 th day from May 30 2007 to July 12 2008 at 9 locations on the Reservation. The samples were analyzed for benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylenes (BTEX) by GC/FID/MS using EPA Method TO 15 procedures. In addition, gasoline samples (6 regular unleaded, 2 midgrade unleaded and 2 super unleaded) were collected in December 2007, May 2008 and July 2008 from five gas stations. The concentrations of BTEX in each gasoline sample were determined by headspace analysis. Vehicle tailpipe sampling was conducted by directly collecting samples from the tailpipe into Tedlar bags on 5 days: March 26, 2008, April 24, 2008, May 8, 2008, May 29, 2008 and June 12, 2008. Three samples were collected from each of the 22 vehicles that were fueled with <b>unleaded</b> <b>regular</b> <b>gasoline</b> from the reservation. Using these measured source profiles and ambient concentrations, the Chemical Mass Balance model was applied to each sample to assess the source contributions of BTEX. The results show that the predominant benzene source is vehicular exhaust with a small contribution from gasoline volatilization. The industrial plant has little or no impact on the ambient benzene concentrations in this community...|$|E

The high prices were considered ironic considering that Alaska {{is one of the main}} suppliers of oil in the United States, but have the highest state average due to scattered villages throughout Alaska such as Lime Village making it difficult to transport oil and other goods.|$|R
50|$|Additional unseen {{changes were}} related to Federal Emission Standards and the {{requirement}} that ALL 1971 cars run on <b>unleaded</b> <b>regular</b> grade <b>gasoline.</b> Compression ratios on all engines were reduced to ~8.5:1. For just this year, engine power and torque specifications were advertised using both the familiar SAE gross rating method (for the last time), and SAE net rating method, which remains the standard today. (Net ratings are more representative of engine output as-installed since they measure output when the engine is fully “dressed” with production intake and exhaust plumbing, cooling system, and accessory loads in place.) Revised ratings for Town and Country engines were: 383 cu. In. 2-BBL V8: 275 (190 net) hp with 375 (305 net) lb-ft; 383 cu. In. 4-BBL V8: 300 (240 net) hp with 410 (310 net) lb-ft; 440 cu.

5000|$|In United States politics, the gas {{tax holiday}} or {{the gas tax}} {{loophole}} was a proposal made by presidential contenders Arizona Senator John McCain and New York Senator Hillary Clinton to suspend the federal excise tax on gasoline from Memorial Day to Labor Day in the year 2008. Proponents argued that this could potentially reduce {{the price of gas}} at the pump by about 18.4 cents a gallon for <b>regular</b> <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> and 24.4 cents a gallon for diesel. If it were done, it was estimated the gas tax holiday would save consumers roughly $30 over the three-month period it would be instated.

40|$|Although {{most people}} are thought to receive their highest acute {{exposures}} to gasoline while refueling, relatively little is actually known about personal, nonoccupational exposures to gasoline during refueling activities. This {{study was designed to}} measure exposures {{associated with the use of}} an oxygenated fuel under cold conditions in Fairbanks, Alaska. We compared concentrations of gasoline components in the blood and in the personal breathing zone (PBZ) of people who pumped <b>regular</b> <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> (referred to as <b>regular</b> <b>gasoline)</b> with concentrations in the blood of those who pumped an oxygenated fuel that was 10 % ethanol (E- 10). A subset of participants in a wintertime engine performance study provided blood samples before and after pumping <b>gasoline</b> (30 using <b>regular</b> <b>gasoline</b> and 30 using E- 10). The biological and environmental samples were analyzed for selected aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in gasoline (benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, m-/p-xylene, and o-xylene); the biological samples were also analyzed for three chemicals not found in gasoline (1, 4 -dichlorobenzene, chloroform, and styrene). People in our study had significantly higher levels of gasoline components in their blood after pumping gasoline than they had before pumping gasoline. The changes in VOC levels in blood were similar whether the individuals pumped <b>regular</b> <b>gasoline</b> or the E- 10 blend. The analysis of PBZ samples indicated that there were also measurable levels of gasoline components in the air during refueling. The VOC levels in PBZ air were similar for the two groups. In this study, we demonstrate that people are briefly exposed to low (ppm and sub-ppm) levels of known carcinogens and other potentially toxic compounds while pumping gasoline, regardless of the type of gasoline used...|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Few things generate more attention and anxiety among American consumers than the price of gasoline. Periods of price increases are accompanied by high levels of media attention and consumer questioning about the causes and impacts of the price changes. The most recent upsurge in prices is no exception. Between January 3 and April 11, 2005, gasoline prices increased nearly every week, and during this time the average U. S. price for <b>regular</b> <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> jumped 50 cents per gallon, adding about $ 7. 8 billion to consumers' total gasoline bill, or about $ 58 for each passenger car in the United States. Spending billions more on gasoline pinched consumer budgets, leaving less money available for other purchases. Beyond having concerns over price increases, consumers {{find it difficult to}} understand how prices can vary so much across the country or even from neighborhood to neighborhood. For example, consumers in San Francisco paid an average of $ 2. 63 per gallon during the week of April 11, 2005, while consumers in Chicago paid $ 2. 33 per gallon; in Denver, $ 2. 25; in New York, $ 2. 19; and in Houston, $ 2. 12.
