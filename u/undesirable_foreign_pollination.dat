5000|$|The Rieucros Camp was an {{internment}} camp on a forested hillside near Mende in the French department of Lozère that operated from January 1939 to February 1942. Prime Minister Édouard Daladier established the camp by decree on January 21, 1939 to isolate {{members of the}} International Brigades from French society after {{the defeat of the}} Second Spanish Republic and subsequent exile, known as la Retirada, in the Spanish Civil War. Other [...] "suspicious and <b>undesirable</b> <b>foreign</b> men," [...] sometimes accused of common law crimes, were also interned. After France's entry into World War II, authorities transferred the men to the camp of le Vernet and began to intern [...] "suspicious and <b>undesirable</b> <b>foreign</b> women" [...] in October 1939. Following the Battle of France, Rieucros fell in the southern unoccupied zone and the Vichy regime assumed control of the camp from Third Republican authorities. In February 1942, authorities transferred the entire camp population of women and children to the camp of Brens.|$|R

In Britain, where the term Jacobin has been linked {{primarily}} to the Mountain, it is sometimes used as a pejorative for radical, left-wing revolutionary politics, especially when it exhibits dogmatism and violent repression. In France, Jacobin now generally indicates a supporter of a centralized republican state and strong central government powers and/or supporters of extensive government intervention to transform society. It is also used in other related senses, indicating proponents of a state education system which strongly promotes and inculcates civic values, and proponents of a strong nation-state capable of resisting any <b>undesirable</b> <b>foreign</b> interference.|$|R

40|$|Although {{homosexuality}} is illegal in Ethiopia, same-sex behaviour is not prosecuted {{because the government}} of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia views homosexuality as a low law enforcement priority. While this may suggest at first glance that the situation for same-sex attracted men is better in Ethiopia than in other countries that retain laws against homosexuality, in reality the illegality of same-sex relations functions throughout Ethiopian society to drive and justify social and economic exclusion and human rights abuses of samesex attracted people. There is a powerful synergy between church and state and sections of the church are occupied with promulgating extreme homophobia by associating homosexuality with taboo superstition, <b>undesirable</b> <b>foreign</b> influence, child abuse and prostitution.

40|$|The article {{highlights}} {{results of}} research over simulative apomixes in pear and its utilization for obtaining haploids and homozygote diploids. It {{has been established}} that over 50 % pear varieties with failed remote hybridization are capable of generating seeds of apomictic origin producing diploid plants. Genotypes displaying maximal inclination to apomixes have been singled out. Apomictic pear seedlings obtained from <b>foreign</b> <b>pollination</b> {{within the limits of}} the same combination are inherent in profound morphological diversity. Fruit-bearing apomicts originated from one and the same maternal plant differ to the same extent as hybrid seedlings of the same family. Genetic markers have enabled to establish that these are embryo sacs in which meiosis has completed that give rise to apomictic seeds. In vitro method as used for the purpose of increasing apomictic plants output has been illustrated. The greatest induction of apomictic shoots in vitro has been reached by alternation of BAP cytokinin at concentration of 1 mg/l and 2 mg/l on the background of GA 3 amounting to 1, 5 mg/l. Grafting with shoots in vitro on non-sterile rootstocks of pear (Pyrus communis) has increased the output of plants up to 80 %. A cytological assessment of 9 apomictic samples is provided. The cytological analysis of samples of apomictic forms has certified the presence of simulative haploid parthenogenesis in pear...|$|R

40|$|Milk, in our {{territory}} {{frequently used}} cow?s milk, {{is very important}} nutrient. Its importance consists in the contents of valuable proteins, easily digestible milk fat, lactose, vitamins and minerals. The quality of raw cow?s milk is characterised by many indicators, for example total number of microorganisms, number of somatic cells, content of basic constituents (fat, protein, lactose, non-fat solids), freezing point or occurrence of <b>undesirable</b> <b>foreign</b> and inhibitory substances. Residuals of inhibitory substances (RIL) {{are one of the}} main criteria of raw milk hygienic quality, where they can appear for example due to prevention and treatment of mastitis. The risk of occurrence and spread of bacterial resistance, disruption of intestinal microflora, allergic reactions and RIL toxic effects, both in human and veterinary medicine, belong among the biggest risks of RIL presence in food and raw materials of animal origin, including milk. Inhibitory substances have an inhibiting effect on development and activity of microorganisms and in particular in milk industry they affect the activity of dairy cultures causing significant production problems. Their presence in milk causes problems when producing cheese, during fermentation of yoghurts and other fermentation during milk processing. Prevention of RIL occurrence depends especially on adherence to basic breeding and veterinary measures when using drugs and medicines, on technology discipline in primary production and regular and strict control of RIL contents in milk from the primary production up to processing when various screening detection methods are used. It is very important to deal with the matter of RIL in milk in connection with quality standards, national legislation and European Union legislation and to control methods used for their detection and verification...|$|R
5000|$|In 1797, Patrick Colquhoun {{was able}} to persuade the West Indies merchants who {{operated}} at the Pool of London on the River Thames, to establish a police force at the docks to prevent rampant theft that was causing annual estimated losses of £500,000 worth of cargo. The idea of a police, as it then existed in France, was considered as a potentially <b>undesirable</b> <b>foreign</b> import. In building {{the case for the}} police in the face of England's firm anti-police sentiment, Colquhoun framed the political rationale on economic indicators to show that a police dedicated to crime prevention was [...] "perfectly congenial to the principle of the British constitution." [...] Moreover, he {{went so far as to}} praise the French system, which had reached [...] "the greatest degree of perfection" [...] in his estimation. [...] With the initial investment of £4,200, the new trial force of the Thames River Police began with about 50 men charged with policing 33,000 workers in the river trades, of whom Colquhoun claimed 11,000 were known criminals and [...] "on the game." [...] The force was a success after its first year, and his men had [...] "established their worth by saving £122,000 worth of cargo and by the rescuing of several lives." [...] Word of this success spread quickly, and the government passed the Marine Police Bill on 28 July 1800, transforming it from a private to public police agency; now the oldest police force in the world. Colquhoun published a book on the experiment, The Commerce and Policing of the River Thames. It found receptive audiences far outside London, and inspired similar forces in other cities, notably, New York City, Dublin, and Sydney.|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} {{of genetically modified}} (GM) crops in the EU has raised questions concerning gene dispersal and co-existence with non-GM farming. Quantitative estimates of the gene dispersal from fields with GM crops to fields with conspecific non-GM crops (conventional or organic) are therefore {{needed in order to}} suggest isolation distances and other management strategies to keep GM-pollination below acceptable threshold values. A meta-analysis of available gene-flow data for oilseed rape (Brassica napus) was performed. The probability distribution that seeds of non-GM oilseed rape are fertilised by foreign pollen grains from a neighbouring field of GM oilseed rape is modelled as functions of the width of the recipient (i. e. pollen receiving) field and the distance to the pollen donor fields. Furthermore, the significance of using a buffer zone (removal of a 1 - 5 m border of a recipient field parallel to the pollen donor field) to reduce GM-pollination of the crop, is quantified and discussed. The predicted median and 95 % credibility level of the probability of <b>foreign</b> <b>pollination</b> is calculated {{as a function of the}} width of the recipient field and the buffer zone, as well as the distance between fields. Analysis of different management strategies shows that an increasing isolation distance is more effective to reduce GM pollen dispersal than the use of a buffer zone, especially for small recipient fields. The analysis shows that increasing the width of a recipient oilseed rape field, relative to the pollen donor field, will have a large effect on reducing the average level of fertilisation by foreign pollen within the recipient field. The results indicate that a GM-pollination percentage < 0. 1 % will be possible if the isolation distance exceeds 100 m and the width of the non-GM field is larger than 200 m. If a threshold value of 0. 3 % is acceptable, an isolation distance of 50 m should be sufficient even for smaller fields. The use of a 5 m discarded buffer zone surrounding the non-GM field is expected to reduce GM pollination by about a third. The implications of the results for field management in conventional and organic farming are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Competition for {{pollination}} {{can be an}} impor-tant {{factor in}} plant reproduction, but {{little attention has been}} given to the effect of the growing number of inva-sive plant species on pollination of native species. As a first step in understanding this threat, we used hand pol-lination to investigate the effects of pollen from an inva-sive species (Lythrum salicaria) on seed set in a sympa-tric and co-flowering native congener (L. alatum). Dis-persal of fluorescent dyes in the field confirms that polli-nators (bumble bees and honey bees) transfer pollen be-tween species. To determine the potential effect of such interspecific pollen transfer on seed set of the native, we pollinated 773 flowers on 20 plants with one of three treatments: legitimate conspecific pollen, a mixture of conspecific and foreign pollen, and foreign pollen. The mixed-pollen treatment resulted in 28. 8 % lower seed set relative to conspecific <b>pollination.</b> <b>Foreign</b> crosses re-sulted in extremely low seed set. Observations of pollen germination indicate that events at the stigmatic surface contribute to the reduction in seed set for mixed pollina-tion. Our results indicate that the impacts of invasive species may extend beyond vegetative competition to in-clude competition for pollination...|$|R
