50|$|A delta-encoded ADC or counter-ramp has an <b>up-down</b> <b>counter</b> {{that feeds}} a {{digital to analog}} {{converter}} (DAC). The input signal and the DAC both go to a comparator. The comparator controls the counter. The circuit uses negative feedback from the comparator to adjust the counter until the DAC's output is close enough to the input signal. The number is read from the counter. Delta converters have very wide ranges and high resolution, but the conversion time is dependent on the input signal level, though it will always have a guaranteed worst-case. Delta converters are often very good choices to read real-world signals. Most signals from physical systems do not change abruptly. Some converters combine the delta and successive approximation approaches; this works especially well when high frequencies are known to be small in magnitude.|$|E

Fault residuals are generated through physically redundant sensors, parity equations and common filtering methods. <b>Up-down</b> <b>counters</b> {{are used for}} decisioning on these fault residuals. These simple counters are commonly used in the aerospace industry to improve missed detection rates. These techniques constitute an easily implementable fault detection and isolation system on an industrial turbine.

40|$|The growing {{interest}} for fast, compact and cost-effective 3 D ranging imagers for automotive applications has prompted to explore many different techniques for 3 D imaging {{and to develop}} new system for this propose. CMOS imagers that exploit phase-resolved techniques provide accurate 3 D ranging with no complex optics and are rugged and costeffective. Phase-resolved techniques indirectly measure the round-trip return of the light emitted by a laser and backscattered from a distant target, computing the phase delay between the modulated light and the detected signal. Singlephoton detectors, with their high sensitivity, allow to actively illuminate the scene with a low power excitation (less than 10 W with diffused daylight illumination). We report on a 4 x 4 array of CMOS SPAD (Single Photon Avalanche Diodes) designed in a high-voltage 0. 35 µm CMOS technology, for pulsed modulation, in which each pixel computes the phase difference between the laser and the reflected pulse. Each pixel comprises a high-performance 30 µm diameter SPAD, an analog quenching circuit, two 9 bit <b>up-down</b> <b>counters</b> and memories to store data during the readout. The first counter counts the photons detected by the SPAD in a time window synchronous with the laser pulse and integrates the whole echoed signal.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we have {{proposed}} a power efficient design of a 4 -bit <b>up-down</b> Johnson <b>counter</b> by using Dual Dynamic Node Pulsed Flip-flop(DDFF) featuring efficient embedded logic module(DDFF-ELM) and then clock gating is incorporated {{in order to reduce}} the power dissipation further. The proposed design employs a DDFF which mainly reduces the power consumption by eliminating the large capacitance present in the pre-charge node of several existing flip-flop designs by separately driving the output pull-up and pull-down transistors by following a split dynamic node structure. This reduces the power up to 40 % compared to conventional architectures of the flip-flops. Then the Embedded logic module is an efficient method to incorporate complex logic functions into the flip-flop. Clock gating is applied to reduce the power consumption up to 50 % due to unnecessary clock activities. Key words—Johnson counter, DDFF, DDFF-ELM, clock gating, XCFF, CDMFF, low power. I...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{prevalence}} of pulse encoders for system state information, an all-digital proportional-integral-derivative (ADPID) is proposed {{as an alternative to}} traditional analog and digital PID controllers. The basic concept of an ADPID stems from the use of pulse-width-modulation (PWM) control signals for continuous-time dynamical systems, in that the controller’s proportional, integral and derivative actions are converted into pulses by means of standard <b>up-down</b> digital <b>counters</b> and other digital logic devices. An ADPID eliminates the need for analog-digital and digital-analog conversion, which can be costly and may introduce error and delay into the system. In the proposed ADPID, the unaltered output from a pulse encoder attached to the system’s output can be interpreted directly. After defining a pulse train to represent the desired output of the encoder, an error signal is formed then processed by the ADPID. The resulting ADPID output or control signal is in PWM format, and can be fed directly into the target system without digital-to-analog conversion. In addition to proposing an architecture for the ADPID, rules are presented to enable control engineers to desig...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Up-down {{counters}} {{are commonly}} used in the aerospace industry for fault detection thresholding. This paper applies the <b>up-down</b> <b>counter</b> technique to detect wind turbine faults. The thresholding problem involves a tradeoff between false alarms and missed detections. Counter based thresholding can detect smaller faults with higher probability and lower false alarms than is possible using simple constant thresholds. This improvement is achieved by effectively introducing dynamics into the thresholding logic as opposed to decisioning based on a single time step.

40|$|A current {{regulator}} is described {{that controls the}} peak current of a power transistor driving an inductive load, such as magnet coils. Presently, the current pulse has a O. l- to 1 -ms adjustable duration with duty cycle to 5 %. Ultimately, the pulse length must be ~ 7 ms with 50 % duty cycle.

40|$|A {{spacecraft}} (8) {{includes a}} movable appendage such as solar panels (12) {{operated by a}} stepping motor (28) driven by pulses (311). In order to reduce vibration andor attitude error, the drive pulses are generated by a clock down-counter (312) with variable count ratio. Predetermined desired clock ratios are stored in selectable memories (314 a-d), and the selected ratio (R) is coupled to a comparator (330) together with the current ratio (C). An <b>up-down</b> <b>counter</b> (340) establishes the current count-down ratio by counting toward the desired ratio {{under the control of}} the comparator; thus, a step change of solar panel speed never occurs. When a direction change is commanded, a flag signal generator (350) disables the selectable memories, and enables a further store (360), which generates a count ratio representing a very slow solar panel rotational rate, so that the rotational rate always slows to a low value before direction is changed.

40|$|Abstract—A {{high-quality}} pitch detector {{has been}} built in digital hard-ware and operates in real time at a 10 kl-Iz sampling rate. The hardware is capable of providing energy as well as pitch-period esthnates. The pitch and energy computations are performed 100 times/s (i. e., once per 10 ms interval). The algorithm to estimate the pitch period uses center clipping, infinite peak clipping, and a simplified autocorrelation analysis. The analysis is performed on a 300 sample section of speech which is both center clipped and infinite peak clipped, yielding a three-level speech signal where the levels are — 1, 0, and + 1 depending on {{the relation of the}} original speech sample to the clipping threshold.
