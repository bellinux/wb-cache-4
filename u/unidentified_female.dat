25|$|The {{characters}} of Ardyn, Gentiana, Iris, Aranea, Umbra, Cindy, Cid, and Verstael were all designed by Roberto Ferrari, {{who had previously}} done work on Type-0 and was involved with the project from its earlier development as Versus XIII. These designs were completed by 2010, when the project was still known as Versus XIII. Ferrari was brought on board the project in 2010 after an <b>unidentified</b> <b>female</b> designer resigned from the project as her art was repeatedly rejected by the developers. The change and subsequent alterations to the game's content meant that many of Ferrari's character designs went unused, something he was openly frustrated about as he considered these unseen characters more visually striking than his surviving designs. Many of his surviving character designs were altered during later development, including those for Gentiana and Umbra. Ardyn and Aranea remained mostly unchanged. Another contributing artist was Yusaku Nakaaki, who helped design the character Cindy.|$|E

40|$|Three {{new species}} of Goezia from fishes in North America are {{described}} and supplemental data for G. minuta and several unidentified adults and larvae are presented. Males, especially their caudal papillae, are necessary to identify most species. For the new species, G. pelagia sp. n. from Rachycentron canadum and Chaetodipterus faber in the northern Gulf of Mexico possesses 12 - 19 preanal, two para-anal, and four postanal pairs of papillae; G. kliksi sp. n. from Pogonias cromis in Lake Borgne, Louisiana, has 10 - 16 preanal, two para-anal, and five postanal pairs of papillae, and G. sinamora sp. n. from Tilapia aurea, Micropterus salmoides, and Morone saxatilis in freshwater habitats in Florida possesses 13 - 16 preanal, two para-anal, and three postanal pairs of papillae. Records on several <b>unidentified</b> <b>females</b> without corresponding males and other assorted specimens are included to reveal a more complete understanding of hosts and localities for species of Goezia. Characteristics provided in a table distinguish the 18 nominal species parasitizing both fishes and aquatic reptiles throughout the world. We also provide observations on pathology, attachment, and life histories of selected species. Whereas most species of Goezia cause conspicuous lesions in fishes, few infected fishes are actually diseased. Also, those diseased fishes are often components of recently established host-parasite relationships...|$|R
