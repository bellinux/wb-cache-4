Such works were <b>uncommon</b> during the lives of writers, attesting to the <b>uncommon</b> popularity Riley had achieved.|$|E

5|$|On {{exposed parts}} of the coast, the muds and sands are scoured by the tides, and have no {{vegetation}} except possibly algae or eelgrass. Where the shoreline is more protected, internationally important salt marshes can form, with several <b>uncommon</b> species. The salt marshes contains glassworts and common cord grass in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants. The <b>uncommon</b> spiral tasselweed and long-bracted sedge are other lower salt marsh specialists. Scrubby sea-blite and matted sea lavender are characteristic plants of the drier upper salt marsh, although they are <b>uncommon</b> in the UK away from this coast. They may occur alongside scarce species including lesser centaury, curved hard-grass and sea pearlwort, with soft hornwort in the dykes.|$|E
5|$|Other {{symptoms}} include: headache, {{nausea and}} vomiting, abdominal pain, muscle pain, or a scarlatiniform rash or palatal petechiae, {{the latter being}} an <b>uncommon</b> but highly specific finding.|$|E

5|$|Variations on plates III and IV exist from Bell's {{original}} woodcuts, {{bearing the}} earlier date of 1 January 1750, and were reprinted in 1790 by John Boydell, but examples from {{either of the}} woodcut printings are <b>uncommon.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{forensic}} crime {{shows are}} often criticized for portraying technologies {{that do not}} exist, these may inspire inventors and research teams, as it is not <b>uncommon</b> for scientific innovations to be first portrayed in science fiction.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} citrus plants yield pressed oils. Some, such as lemon and orange oil, {{are used as}} {{essential}} oils, which is <b>uncommon</b> for pressed oils. The seeds of many if not {{most members of the}} citrus family yield usable oils.|$|E
5|$|According to Avery, Donatello's Ascension of Christ and the Giving of the Keys to St. Peter {{may have}} been {{intended}} to share {{the front of the}} sarcophagus, further strengthening the papal associations, which were created by dating Cossa's death using the ancient Roman Calends of January, which was <b>uncommon</b> on Florentine tombs, but was used in papal ones.|$|E

Temples and public worship of Chhinnamasta are rare, and her private worship by lay worshippers is probably <b>uncommon.</b>|$|E
5|$|Closed-circuit: A second rebreather {{containing}} one or {{more independent}} diving cylinders for its gas supply. Using another rebreather as a bail-out is possible but <b>uncommon.</b> Although the long duration of rebreathers seems compelling for bail-out, rebreathers are relatively bulky, complex, vulnerable to damage and require more time to start breathing from, than easy-to-use, instantly available, robust and reliable open-circuit equipment.|$|E

5|$|D-isomers are <b>uncommon</b> in live organisms. For instance, {{gramicidin}} is a polypeptide made up from {{mixture of}} D- and L-amino acids. Other compounds containing D-amino acid are tyrocidine and valinomycin. These compounds disrupt bacterial cell walls, particularly in Gram-positive bacteria. Only 837 D-amino acids {{were found in}} Swiss-Prot database (187 million amino acids analysed).|$|E

5|$|Earwigs {{have five}} molts {{in the year}} before they become adults. Many earwig species display {{maternal}} care, which is <b>uncommon</b> among insects.

As the nymphs molt, sexual dimorphism such as differences in pincer shapes begins to show.|$|E
