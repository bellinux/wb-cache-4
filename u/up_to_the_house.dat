5|$|After the Reform Bill was {{rejected}} in the Lords, the House of Commons immediately passed a {{motion of confidence}} affirming their support for Lord Grey's administration. Because parliamentary rules prohibited {{the introduction of the}} same bill twice during the same session, the ministry advised the new king, William IV, to prorogue Parliament. As soon as the new session began in December 1831, the Third Reform Bill was brought forward. The bill was in a few respects different from its predecessors; it no longer proposed a reduction in the total membership of the House of Commons, and it reflected data collected during the census that had just been completed. The new version passed in the House of Commons by even larger majorities in March 1832; it was once again sent <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Lords.|$|E
5|$|At the motel, Lila and Sam meet Norman. Sam distracts him by {{striking}} up {{a conversation}} while Lila sneaks <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> When Sam tells Norman they've come to question his mother, he knocks Sam out and rushes to the house. Lila sees Norman approaching and hides by going down steps {{that lead to the}} fruit cellar. There she finds Mrs. Bates sitting in a chair. Lila turns her around and discovers that she is in fact a mummified corpse. Lila screams as Norman runs into the cellar, holding a chef's knife and wearing his mother's clothes and a wig. Before Norman can attack Lila, Sam, having regained consciousness, subdues him.|$|E

Tim returns to the {{backyard}} and uncovers a ring and what appears to be a human hand before he decides to stop digging. He throws everything he has found back into the hole he has dug before starting to fill it in. He walks back <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and, finding Lee waiting for him, kisses her. The next morning, they pack up their belongings and go to pick up Jude.|$|E

50|$|Price was {{the first}} {{qualified}} and competent Surveyor General in Hong Kong's history from 1873 to 1889. He was conversant with electrical engineering developments both in Europe and America. He met with Layton and Wickham from the Hongkong Electric Company to develop electricity in the colony. As a result, the government offered $19,000 for fifty arc lamps and pumping water <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> on <b>the</b> Peak.|$|R
5|$|The Bill {{was then}} sent <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Lords, a {{majority}} in which {{was known to be}} hostile to it. After the Whigs' decisive victory in the 1831 election, some speculated that opponents would abstain, rather than openly defy the public will. Indeed, when the Lords voted on the second reading of the bill after a memorable series of debates, many Tory peers did refrain from voting. However, the Lords Spiritual mustered in unusually large numbers, and of 22 present, 21 voted against the Bill. It failed by 41 votes.|$|E
5|$|A US {{version of}} the music video was {{directed}} by Tim Hope. The video employs a dream-like animated world, with woodland glades, cartoon flowers which bloom instantly and the air full of clockwork-like insects and birds, but with real people embedded within it. On top of a mountain, a woman (Nerys Davies) waters plants inside a house. The band are aboard a horse carriage that travels through a rural landscape. A small coloured bird flies from the carriage <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> lands on the woman's windowsill and flaps its wings as if delivering a message. It transforms into a crow and then into a huge black menacing bird. The bird flies over the house and turns into a black cloud, which pours rain onto the land. The rain burns holes on the things it falls on, and crow feathers protrude from the holes. Finally a tornado lifts up the house, spinning it across the sky and then dropping it precisely on a normal suburban street. The video's acclaimed visuals earned Hope an MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction in 2002. It was also nominated for Breakthrough Video.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{outbuildings}} and other structures {{on the original}} property that are included as contributing resources. To the northeast, on the mountain's summit, is Woodsome Lodge, a rustic log cabin with its own views of the Highlands. The estate's spring-fed wooden water tank is also nearby. A stone arch bridge was added {{at the same time}} as the library wing. Stone was also used for a -story gatehouse along the winding driveway leading <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> from Cat Rock Road (NY 403).|$|E

25|$|The {{effect of}} the Act is that the House of Lords can delay those Bills that it could {{formerly}} veto. If they have been sent <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Lords at least one month {{before the end of}} the Session, Money Bills can be delayed for up to one month after being sent up, and other Bills can be delayed for up to one year after being sent up. The period for which Bills other than Money Bills could be delayed was originally two years. The Speaker was given the power to certify which bills are classified as money bills.|$|E
25|$|The second {{main feature}} was for rights of audience. Mackay {{proposed}} that all lawyers, whether barristers or solicitors, should require {{a certificate of}} competence {{to work in the}} higher courts, while their initial professional qualifications would allow them to practice in the lower courts. This proposal allowed solicitors to gain full rights of audience <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Lords with the appropriate certification, and was widely disliked by barristers and judges. The idea that barristers would not automatically have rights of audience also irritated them, and the idea that the Lord Chancellor would be responsible for defining which bodies could grant these certificates undermined the principle that the legal profession should be independent from the Government.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} {{on the morning of}} the day before Yom Kippur, they placed the High Priest at the Eastern Gate and brought before him oxen, rams, and sheep, so that he could become {{familiar}} with the service. The rest of the seven days, they did not withhold food or drink from him, but near nightfall on the eve of Yom Kippur, they would not let him eat much, as food might make him sleep. The sages of the court took him <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> of Avtinas and handed him over to the elders of the priesthood. As the sages of the court took their leave, they cautioned him that he was the messenger of the court, and adjured him in God's Name that he not change anything in the service from what they had told him. He and they turned aside and wept that they should have to suspect him of doing so.|$|E

25|$|The Julian Street Jr. {{residence}} {{is still}} extant. By 1974, {{the house was}} owned by Howard and Janette R. Tomkins and the property was subdivided to allow a separate building lot. Other changes were {{the removal of the}} stone wall and guardrail by the driveway, which was then paved with asphalt, and building a playhouse {{at the top of a}} rock pile in front of the house. The house was also changed: the stone wall behind the house was extended into a curve while the front gravel walkway was retained, the ramp behind the serpentine wall had stairs added to it, a curved wall was added in front of the front door, and a flagstone terrace was added to the back and side of the west part of the house. By the late 1970s, the house was owned by the Birnbaum family, who added steps to the front ramp <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> reduced the height of the serpentine wall, and added a raised entertainment area in part of the large living room.|$|E
500|$|The cottage {{garden is}} {{designed}} to appear artless, rather than contrived or pretentious. Instead of artistic curves, or grand geometry, there is an artfully designed irregularity. Borders can go right <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> lawns are replaced with tufts of grass or flowers, and beds can be as wide as needed. Instead of the discipline of large scale color schemes, there is the simplicity of harmonious color combinations between neighbouring plants. The overall appearance can be of [...] "a vegetable garden that has {{been taken over by}} flowers." [...] The method of planting closely packed plants was supposed {{to reduce the amount of}} weeding and watering required, but planted stone pathways or turf paths, and clipped hedges overgrown with wayward vines, are cottage garden features requiring well-timed maintenance.|$|E
500|$|As a young man, Cagney became {{interested}} in farming – sparked by a soil conservation lecture he had attended – {{to the extent that}} during his first walkout from Warner Bros., he helped to found a [...] farm in Martha's Vineyard. Cagney loved that no concrete roads surrounded the property, only dirt tracks. The house was rather run-down and ramshackle, and Billie was initially reluctant to move in, but soon came to love the place, as well. After being inundated by movie fans, Cagney sent out a rumor that he had hired a gunman for security. The ruse proved so successful that when Spencer Tracy came to visit, his taxi driver refused to drive <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> saying, [...] "I hear they shoot!" [...] Tracy had to go {{the rest of the way}} on foot.|$|E

Constructing housing price histories from central core to outermost suburbs for five submarkets in the Twin Cities, this research reveals the uneven geography of housing bubbles and foreclosures across the metro region.
