5|$|The {{height of}} horses is usually {{measured}} at the highest point of the withers, where the neck meets the back. This point is used {{because it is a}} stable point of the anatomy, unlike the head or neck, which move <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> relation to the body of the horse.|$|E
5|$|One {{recorded}} case of courtship behavior involving curve-billed thrashers describes two males attacking {{each other}} vigorously and resorting to purring and hissings sounds when neither bird appeared to relent. The two males then puffed up their chests and strutted <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> {{front of the}} female. They continued to alternate between purr and hiss and fighting one another until one triumphed. The victor flew towards the female and both chirped melodically before copulation.|$|E
5|$|Fully aquatic mammals, the {{cetaceans}} and sirenians, {{have lost}} their legs and have a tail fin to propel themselves through the water. Flipper movement is continuous. Whales swim by moving their tail fin and lower body up and down, propelling themselves through vertical movement, while their flippers are mainly used for steering. Their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers. Most species have a dorsal fin to prevent themselves from turning upside-down in the water. The flukes of sirenians are raised <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> long strokes to move the animal forward, and can be twisted to turn. The forelimbs are paddle-like flippers which aid in turning and slowing.|$|E

5|$|The male {{chooses the}} nest site, and uses {{it for his}} {{courtship}} display, spending much time calling nearby. When a female comes near a male at his nest the male begins to display by raising his head, drooping his wings, pushing his chest forward, and lowering his tail. He then bows <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> front of the female, who will lunge and then fly away if unreceptive. Both sexes take part in building the nest, which consists of a loose, untidy bunch of dry grass which fills the nesting cavity, lined with fur and feathers for warmth.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} Earth's {{magnetic}} field {{is one of}} heteroscedastic fluctuation. An instantaneous measurement of it, or several measurements of it across the span of decades or centuries, are not sufficient to extrapolate an overall trend in the field strength. It has gone <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the past for unknown reasons. Also, noting the local intensity of the dipole field (or its fluctuation) is insufficient to characterize Earth's magnetic field as a whole, as it is not strictly a dipole field. The dipole component of Earth's field can diminish even while the total magnetic field remains the same or increases.|$|E
5|$|Quatre Bras was a hamlet at a {{strategic}} crossroads {{on the road}} to Brussels. French control of it would not only threaten the city, but divide Wellington's allied army from Blucher's Prussians. At 14:00 on 16 June 1815, after some initial skirmishing, the main French force under Marshall Ney, approached Quatre Bras from the south. They came up against the 2nd Netherlands Division who had formed a line well in advance of the crossroads. Facing three French infantry divisions and a cavalry brigade, the Dutch and Nassau troops were forced back but did not break. Reinforcements arrived at 15:00, being a Dutch cavalry brigade, Picton's 5th British Division, followed closely by the Brunswick Corps. The sharpshooters of the Brunswick Advance Guard regiment were sent to support Dutch skirmishers in Bossou Wood on the allied right (western) flank; the rest of the corps took up a reserve position across the Brussels road. The Duke reassured his inexperienced troops by walking <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> front of them, calmly puffing on his pipe.|$|E

5|$|In November 1987, Warner Bros. Records {{commissioned}} {{the release of}} You Can Dance—Madonna's first retrospective—which was aimed at the dance segment of her audience. It was an album containing seven of Madonna's songs in remixed format, which was still a revolutionary concept in the 1980s. By the mid-eighties, post-disco dance music was extremely popular {{and the concept of}} remix was widely regarded as a new direction of music. Several artists were remixing their tracks and compiling them to create new albums. Mixing was an interpretative process, where the artist was usually involved, but the development was generally looked after the record producer. The different parts of a song, including the lead vocals, background vocals, guitars, bass, synths, drum machine—all went through the process of mixing to sound considerably different from their original counterpart. Mixing determined how loud these instruments were going to sound in relation to each other and what particular sound effects should be added to each instrument. Improvements in studio technologies meant the possibility of shaping the sound of a song in any way, after it has been recorded. The arrangements were itself created at the mixing stage, rather than being created previously. A particular vocal phrase could be endlessly copied, repeated, chopped up, transposed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> pitch and give them more echo, reverberation, treble or bass.|$|E

Langer responded by hitting {{the highest score in}} the county's first-class history, but without him the team struggled in both short and long versions of the game, failed to repeat their Twenty20 success and languished at or near the bottom of both County Championship and Pro40 second division tables.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War it was {{the site}} of a {{tracking}} station for anti-aircraft gunnery practice. The set up was that an aircraft flew <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> front of the guns, which would try to bring it down. Initially, radio-controlled 'Queen Bee' aircraft were used, and the flat concrete foundation by the white tower on the cairn, now the location of the Solway Harvester memorial stone, was laid down for one of the control huts. The memorial stone to the Solway Harvester {{is in the form of}} an anchor set in a granite block.|$|E
25|$|This {{butterfly}} frequents forest {{paths and}} streams. The male {{is fond of}} sun and avoids the shade. It frequents flowers especially of Mussaenda frondosa, Ixora coccinea, Jasminum species and Asystasia gangetica.

Has a rapid unidirectional flight and frequently changes course, hopping <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> its flight path. Difficult to catch. Known to bask in the sun. Attracted to damp patch and has greater tolerance to other butterflies and humans while lapping up the mineral rich moisture. Known to visit animal droppings.|$|E

25|$|The proprietors of the Kennet and Avon Canal Company had {{inspected}} Weldon's {{device and}} recommended {{it to the}} adjoining Somerset Coal Canal for use at Combe Hay on their new line, to overcome water supply problems there. (The Somerset Coal Canal led directly to the Kennet and Avon {{and it was in}} the latter company's interest that the new route be opened as quickly as possible.) Three such locks were proposed, each to be 80ft (24.3m)long and 60ft (18.2m) deep and containing a closed wooden box which could take the boat. This box moved <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the 60ft (18.2m) deep pool of water, which never left the lock.|$|E
25|$|Gillnets {{existed in}} ancient times as archaeological {{evidence}} from the Middle East demonstrates. In North America, Native American fishermen used cedar canoes and natural fibre nets, e.g., made with nettles or the inner bark of cedar. They would attach stones {{to the bottom of}} the nets as weights, and pieces of wood to the top, to use as floats. This allowed the net to suspend straight <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the water. Each net would be suspended either from shore or between two boats. Native fishers in the Pacific Northwest, Canada, and Alaska still commonly use gillnets in their fisheries for salmon and steelhead.|$|E
25|$|A round {{drilling}} edge is used, {{being the}} size of a drinking bowl, while the depth of the borehole amounts to several tens of zhang. Large bamboo stems are used with the septa removed and fitted together by male-female joints to form the well, thus keeping the fresh water out so that the salty spring water comes up by itself. Smaller bamboo tubes are also used which travel <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the wells as buckets. They have no bottom, but an orifice is mounted at the top. A piece of leather of several inches in size is hung up. As the tubes go {{in and out of the}} brine, the air pushes and sucks, closing and opening the leather valve. Each tube brings up several dou of brine… Where profit is to be had, people do not fail to know about it.|$|E

25|$|Meconium, or {{the first}} feces {{produced}} by the foal, is a hard pelleted substance. It is normally passed within the first 24 hours of the foal's life, but may become impacted in the distal colon or rectum. Meconium impaction is most commonly is seen in foals 1–5 days of age, and {{is more common in}} miniature foals and in colts more than fillies (possibly because fillies have a wider pelvis). Foals will stop suckling, strain to defecate (presents as an arched back and lifted tail), and may start showing overt signs of colic such as rolling and getting <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b> <b>In</b> later stages, the abdomen will distend as it continues to fill with gas and feces. Meconium impactions are often diagnosed by clinical signs, but digital examination to feel for impacted meconium, radiographs, and ultrasound may also be used.|$|E
