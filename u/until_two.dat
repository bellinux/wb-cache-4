His efforts to adjust to military life and become a good soldier included springing out of bed obediently each morning, which earned him the resentment of fellow soldiers because he concealed his hatred of reveille too well and appeared eager {{to wake up in}} the mornings.|$|E

5|$|At the 2004 Square Enix E3 Press conference, {{producer}} Shinji Hashimoto {{said that}} many mysteries of the first game would be answered. Square Enix launched the official Japanese website in May 2005, followed by the English website in December 2005. The websites featured videos and information regarding characters and worlds. Commercials were aired in Japan which highlighted the numerous Disney characters in the game. Although the game was announced in September 2003, a release date for the game was not set <b>until</b> <b>two</b> years later. Nomura admitted that the game was announced too early and information regarding the game was not released until a debut period was in sight.|$|E
5|$|Francis Hillier Taylor, {{previously}} senior history {{master at}} The Skinners' School, was appointed as Morgan's successor {{at the end}} of the spring term in 1946, a position that attracted 321 applications. During his tenure, Taylor significantly expanded the school facilities: in 1948, the headmaster's living quarters were converted to include a secretaries office, waiting room and medical inspection room (the headmaster moved to neighbouring Brook House, which was purchased by The Skinners' Company). In 1955, new geography rooms were constructed, followed three years later by a new gymnasium. Although not first used <b>until</b> <b>two</b> years later, a swimming pool was constructed in 1964 at the cost of £9,000. Taylor also introduced some major curriculum changes, including the introduction of new subjects such as rural biology and zoology.|$|E

5|$|In 1702 Bruce was {{commissioned}} by the burgesses of Stirling to design a new tolbooth for the town. Bruce provided only sketch plans, which were executed by local masons between 1703 and 1705. Bruce's last country houses were Harden House (now known as Mertoun House), built for the Scotts in the Borders, and his smallest house, Auchendinny in Midlothian. His final work, in around 1710, was for Nairne House, for the Jacobite Lord Nairne. The house was not completed <b>until</b> <b>two</b> years after Bruce's death, {{and the extent of}} his involvement is unclear. Nairne House was demolished in 1760, although the cupola was retained and installed {{on the roof of the}} King James VI Hospital in nearby Perth.|$|E
5|$|In previews, {{publications}} such as IGN and GameSpot {{noted that}} the graphics had been improved, {{and that there were}} many new characters and locations. The new minigames were previewed, and IGN pointed out that they offered enough complexity to back up the simple gameplay. In an interview with GameSpot, Ted Price stated that the emphasis for the title was on the new critters, but that Spyro would not be left behind in the story. Year of the Dragon also implemented crack protection, in addition to the copy protection previous games had contained. This helped prevent hackers from cracking the game <b>until</b> <b>two</b> months after release.|$|E
5|$|John Douglas (11 April 183023 May 1911) was an English {{architect}} who designed over 500buildings in Cheshire, North Wales, and northwest England, {{in particular in}} the estate of Eaton Hall. He was trained in Lancaster and practised throughout his career from an office in Chester. Initially he ran the practice on his own, but from 1884 <b>until</b> <b>two</b> years before his death he worked in partnerships {{with two of his}} former assistants.|$|E

5|$|John Henry Iles, {{who took}} over control of Belle Vue in 1925, {{believed}} that expansion of the rides and the fun aspect of the park was the way forward, and added attractions such as dodgems, the Caterpillar, the Ghost Train, Jack & Jill, and the Flying Sea Planes. The Scenic Railway, purchased in 1925 but not fully operational <b>until</b> <b>two</b> years later, proved {{to be one of}} Belle Vue's most popular rides, and remained in use until 1975.|$|E
5|$|Mac Curtis Speedie (January 12, 1920 – March 5, 1993) was an American {{football}} end {{who played}} for the Cleveland Browns in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and National Football League (NFL) for seven years, and later served for two years as {{head coach of the}} American Football League's Denver Broncos. A tall and quick runner whose awkward gait helped him deceive defenders and get open, Speedie led his league in receptions four times during his career and was selected as a first-team All-Pro six times. His career average of 800 yards per season was not surpassed <b>until</b> <b>two</b> decades after his retirement, and his per-game average of 50 yards went unequalled for 20 years after he left the game.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, in October 2014, Lois Leveen speculated in The Atlantic {{that the}} {{original}} Shakespeare play did not contain a balcony. The word, balcone, {{did not exist in}} the English language <b>until</b> <b>two</b> years after Shakespeare's death. The balcony was certainly used in Thomas Otway's 1679 play, The History and Fall of Caius Marius, which had borrowed much of its story from Romeo and Juliet and placed the two lovers in a balcony reciting a speech similar to that between Romeo and Juliet. Leveen suggested that during the 18th century, David Garrick chose to use a balcony in his adaptation and revival of Romeo and Juliet and modern adaptations have continued this tradition.|$|E

5|$|No {{games in}} the series were {{released}} outside of Japan <b>until</b> <b>two</b> characters, Marth and Roy, were included as playable characters in the 2001 fighting game Super Smash Bros. Melee. Their popularity eventually convinced Nintendo to release the next game, The Blazing Blade, in Western regions under the title Fire Emblem in 2003. Many {{games in the}} series have sold well, despite a decline during the 2000s {{which resulted in the}} series' near-cancellation. Individual entries have generally been praised, and the series as a whole has been lauded for its gameplay, and it is cited as a seminal series in the tactical role-playing genre. Characters from multiple games have also been included in crossovers with other franchises.|$|E
5|$|Springbok mate year-round, though {{females are}} more likely to enter oestrus during the rainy season, when food is more plentiful. Females are able to {{conceive}} at as early as six to seven months, whereas males do not attain sexual maturity <b>until</b> <b>two</b> years; rut lasts 5 to 21 days. When a female approaches a rutting male, the male holds his head and tail at level with the ground, lowers his horns, and makes a loud grunting noise to attract her. The male then urinates and sniffs the female's perineum. If the female is receptive, she urinates, as well, and the male makes a flehmen gesture, and taps his leg till the female leaves or permits him to mate. Copulation consists of a single pelvic thrust.|$|E
5|$|The Empire Stadium (later to {{be known}} as Wembley Stadium) was chosen as the main venue, ahead of the White City Stadium, which had assumed that role during the 1908 Summer Olympics. This was due to the Empire Stadium's ability to hold a greater number of events, {{reducing}} the need for additional venues to be found. A new approach road was required to connect the stadium to the nearby Wembley Park tube station, so it was agreed that Wembley Stadium Ltd. would cover the costs in return for a share of the proceeds for the events held there. Motorcycle and greyhound races usually held at the Empire Stadium were highly profitable events, which meant that a cinder running track was not laid down <b>until</b> <b>two</b> weeks before the opening ceremony.|$|E

5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{initially}} {{thought the}} center {{might not have}} been at the surface, and the agency indicated low forecasting confidence, as they could not determine a circulation center. The difficulty arose from the large, sprawling nature of the storm, and by later on May 27 a new center formed, as confirmed by radar imagery and the Hurricane Hunters. That night, the extremely small center made landfall just south of Savannah, Georgia, affecting a very small area with winds of 65mph (100km/h) and a minimum pressure of 991 mbar (hPa; 29.26 inHg). Around the time of landfall, Alpha developed a warm core, indicating some tropical characteristics. The storm weakened quickly over land, although it did not dissipate <b>until</b> <b>two</b> days later over the northeast Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The Stella power {{stations}} were {{a pair of}} now-demolished coal-fired {{power stations}} in the North East of England that were a landmark in the Tyne valley for over 40years. The stations stood {{on either side of}} a bend of the River Tyne: Stella South power station, the larger, near Blaydon in Gateshead, and Stella North power station near Lemington in Newcastle. Their name originated from the nearby Stella Hall, a manor house close to Stella South that by the time of their construction had been demolished and replaced by a housing estate. They operated from shortly after the nationalisation of the British electrical supply industry <b>until</b> <b>two</b> years after the Electricity Act of 1989, when the industry passed into the private sector.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} {{associations of}} selected nations {{were invited to}} send a team, but the choice of Uruguay as a venue for the competition meant a long and costly trip across the Atlantic Ocean for European sides. Indeed, no European country pledged to send a team <b>until</b> <b>two</b> months {{before the start of}} the competition. Rimet eventually persuaded teams from Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia to make the trip. In total, 13 nations took part: seven from South America, four from Europe and two from North America.|$|E
