40|$|Despite the {{remarkable}} jurisprudential {{development on the}} part of the Courts of Justice of the European Union on the free movement of companies, the freedom of movement of certain categories of establishment has been somewhat hampered by the adoption and use of very fine and subtle distinctions. This paper attempts to address this present stumbling block lying in the path of unobstructed corporate mobility within the European Union to the detriment of achieving <b>undistorted</b> <b>competition</b> and a functional internal market. This author argues that the root of the problem remains the Court’s stubborn attachment to a particular rule developed in the Daily Mail case which effectively places Member States in a privileged and potentially abusive position with respect to companies emigrating towards other Member States. This paper attempts to challenge the ‘Daily Mail rule’ by arguing in favour of its abandonment and by proposing further liberalisation of alternative routes towards establishment, thus furthering the unhindered exercise of the free movement of companies in the European Union...|$|E
40|$|Establishing {{open and}} <b>undistorted</b> <b>competition</b> within the {{internal}} {{market is a}} primary goal of the EU legal framework. Price controls, by contrast, are among the clearest derogations from this overarching objective. Yet much price regulation continues to occur within the internal market. The treatment of such regulation thus raises challenging questions, both substantive and institutional, {{about the nature of}} economic governance {{in the context of the}} EU’s ‘highly competitive social market economy’. This article begins with a consideration of price regulation, both in economic terms and in relation to its place within the institutional and ideological structure of the EU. It then examines differing approaches seen in EU law: from a sceptical prohibitive approach, to a cautious yet more receptive permissive approach, to an essentially prescriptive approach incorporating price regulation into the fabric of the internal market. The aim is to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the challenges facing the pursuit of ‘open and undistorted competition’ within a modern social market economy...|$|E
40|$|Whatever the {{protection}} afforded to trade marks, it {{must always be}} balanced against general interests, in particular the fundamental freedom of expression and the guarantee of <b>undistorted</b> <b>competition,</b> {{as reflected in the}} Lisbon Treaty, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. The need for an appropriate balance is inherent in trade mark law. It is an issue of particular importance in the light of ongoing technological, economic and social developments, and of considerable complexity because of the diversity of legitimate interests of trade mark proprietors, consumers, competitors and the public at large. Against this background, the Recommendation provides guidance on how to offer sufficient room for freedom of expression and freedom of competition in the envisaged new EU trade mark legislation. It addresses measures to be taken by legislators, trade mark registration offices and the courts at various stages: from the grant of trade mark rights and the analysis of trade mark infringement to limitations of trade mark protection and the appropriate distribution of the burden of proof...|$|E
40|$|Competition {{policy and}} law play {{a pivotal role}} in the {{development}} of the European market process. This role, however, becomes subject to revision in the time of recession. Historically each period of economic downturn is accompanied by severe critique and substantial limitation of the principles of free market with <b>undistorted</b> <b>competition.</b> Crisis cartels and similar otherwise restrictive practices often become not only tolerated but even encouraged by the regulators. This compromise is seen as an inevitable trade-off between competition and other legitimate societal goals, such as industrial growth, social stability, total welfare and sometimes even national security. On the other hand, each regulatory ‘turbulence’, which is caused by the revision of the role of competition within the markets, can be also seen as a fruitful time for introducing new elements to the competition policy itself and testing new theories of competition. Dialectical antitrust is one of these theories. This article explores the role of competition authorities in the period of economic crisis applying methodological apparatus of the theory of dialectical antitrust...|$|E
40|$|With recent entries into {{numerous}} {{agreements and}} associations {{such as the}} North American Free Trade Agreement and the World Trade Organization (WTO), {{there can be no}} doubt that United States leaders have been following the principles of globalization, and thus free trade. The WTO describes free trade as, “a system of rules dedicated to open, fair, and <b>undistorted</b> <b>competition.</b> ” This includes the slow elimination or reduction of trade barriers such as quotas and tariffs, but also provides for the protection of intellectual property, outlaws exporting below cost to gain market share, and requires a major reduction, and eventual removal, of government domestic support of industry (Understanding, 12). The United States supports these factors strongly, and it has also been at the forefront urging other nations to do the same. However, there is one sector in particular where its actions ring of hypocrisy: agriculture. This hypocrisy was glaringly displayed during the WTO Doha Agenda Cancun talks last September. Because it was unresponsive to the request by Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mali to decrease its domestic support to the cotton industry, the United States faced a formal WTO lawsuit in which Brazil charged that the subsidies paid to America...|$|E
40|$|Companies spend a {{significant}} part of their investment {{in order to create a}} Brand experience for the consumer. Besides large sums spent on the design of consumer goods, companies such as Apple are eager to create a brand experience by implementing a certain store design. Hence, these companies have a well-reasoned urge to protect such distinct store designs utilizing the current intellectual property system. In the tradition of the U. S. approach, where the get-up of a business venue can be protected by trade dress law, the most recent European Jurisprudence seems to tend towards the protection of such a get-up by trade mark law. As this could be good news for companies with a distinct store concept and design, this new approach also raises some concern: How will the protection of the get-up of a business venue affect competition? What are the measures to guarantee only distinct and non-functional store designs will find their way into the holy land of trade mark protection?

40|$|European Integration was {{constructed}} as a primarily economic project. In its formative phase ordoliberal scholars started {{to promote the}} understanding of the ensemble of European economic freedoms togther with a system of <b>undistorted</b> <b>competition</b> as the legal framework and normative core of the EEC, i. e. as Europe’s ‘economic’ constitution. Economic and Monetary Union as institutionalized by the Maastricht Treaty were expected to complete this project. However, the whole edifice started to erode immediately after its establishment. Following the financial and the sovereign debt crises, EMU with its commitments to price stability and its focus on monetary politics is by now widely perceived as a failed construction precisely because of its reliance on inflexible rules. The European crisis management seeks to compensate these failures by regime which disregards the European order of competences, des-empowers national institutions and burdens in particular Southern Europe with austerity measures. This new mode of economic governance establishes pan-European commitments to budgetary discipline and macroeconomic balancing. The ideal of an ordering of the European economy ‘through law’ is thereby abolished while the economic and social prospects of these efforts seem gloomy and the Union’s political legitimacy is eroding...|$|E
40|$|Title: Special {{responsibility}} of undertaking in dominant position Author: Iva Čechráková Department: Department of Business Law Supervisor: JUDr. Daniel Patěk, Ph. D Abstract: This thesis {{deals with the}} doctrine of special {{responsibility of}} the dominant undertaking and related issues. The special responsibility of the dominant undertaking is the obligation not to allow its conduct to impair genuine <b>undistorted</b> <b>competition</b> on the common market. The doctrine of the special responsibility {{is tied to the}} prohibition on abuse of such position. One concept could not be assessed without the other, because the concept of special responsibility of the dominant undertaking is a fundamental principle for the application of the prohibition on abuse of such position. Based on {{that it is necessary to}} describe in this thesis the prohibition on abuse of dominant position together with selected prohibited practices, in which the special responsibility of the dominant undertaking is reflected. This responsibility presupposes a higher standard of vigilance reflected in the conduct of such an undertaking, because an undertaking in dominant position on the relevant market could not take all actions that the other undertakings lacking such market power could do. The question of the superdominant undertakings and the scope of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{explains}} the Lisbon Treaty’s provisions relating to competition policy {{and offers a}} dynamic interpretation of Article 102 Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which could justify the consideration of an effects-based approach to those anti-competitive practices that are most harmful to the final consumers under the economic theory of consumer welfare. The implications of ‘consumerprotection requirements’ must shed special light on Article 12 TFEU. Therefore, {{this article examines the}} possibility of shifting the courts’ teleological interpretation of Article 102, which is based on Protocol 27 ’s ‘undistorted competition’, towards a legal balancing test of the Treaty’s objectives. It also highlights the interpretation of <b>undistorted</b> <b>competition</b> within the internal market and the interplay between EU ‘free’ and fair and unfair competition rules. The balance of EU competition law should, therefore, be performed between Article 119 TFEU’s free competition or economic freedom-based competition and Article 12 as ensuring a ‘high level of protection’, as embedded in the Treaty, for the final consumers. This article explains how consumer-protection requirements must be defined narrowly so that Article 12 may be applied to Article 102. Article 12 can, therefore, mandate a high level of consumer protection for the final consumers in implementing such a specific policy as the abuse of dominance...|$|E
40|$|The essay {{starts from}} the {{assumption}} that the efforts to cure Europe’s democracy deficits will also have to address the social problématique of the Europeanization process. This is a challenge with new dimensions. Europe had started its integrationist path as a mere economic community. In its formative era, the constitutional perspectives of German Ordo-liberalism were attractive. In the ordo-liberal account, the European polity has a twofold structure: At supranational level, it is committed to economic rationality and a system of <b>undistorted</b> <b>competition.</b> Redistributive (social) policies could – and should – be left to the Member States. This edifice was refined in the 1970 s and 80 s. Monetary Union and the Stability Pact completed it. The German Constitutional Court’s Maastricht judgment endorsed its constitutional validity. However, the new dynamics and the strive for an ever closer Union in the Maastricht Treaty has led to a strengthening of European regulatory policies and a broadening of their scope, which were incompatible with the ordo-liberal legacy. The erosion of the economic constitution has not paved the way to a cure for Europe’s social deficit. Neither the Open Method of Co-ordination nor the commitment to a social market economy in the Constitutional Treaty nor the new social rights provide a conceptually sufficient and politically credible basis for this end.

40|$|Free and <b>undistorted</b> <b>competition</b> is a core {{feature of}} the {{internal}} market and European Union more broadly, secured, inter alia, by the competition rules under arts 101 and 102 TFEU, which regulate the exercise of private market power. Although, historically, enforcement of EU competition law was tightly centralised in the Commission, more recently there have been significant efforts towards decentralisation, both to national competition authorities (NCAs) and, perhaps more radically, to “private attorneys general” through antitrust damages actions before domestic courts. Spurred on by decisive pronouncements from the Court of Justice, the Commission has spent {{the best part of}} a decade consulting on and crafting proposals for EU harmonisation in the area of private antitrust enforcement. With Directive 2014 / 104 /EU, the Commission’s vision for a legislative instrument that can, at least in theory, inspire and facilitate the development of a “competition culture” within the EU, whereby both the rules and underlying principles of EU competition law become entrenched within everyday commercial life, has become reality. As this contribution demonstrates, the new Directive, non-exhaustive in scope and eschewing maximum harmonisation, is essentially an exercise in compromise and tempered expectations. Nonetheless, there is much to the Directive that is positive and noteworthy, both as an example of relatively intense harmonisation of tort law at EU level, and as a strong reaffirmation of the central role that private enforcement now plays within the framework of EU competition law more generally...|$|E
40|$|The EU is {{currently}} re-conceptualizing {{the goals of}} competition law and their place within the EC Treaty. Whereas the Draft Reform Treaty is emphasizing the weight of public policy goals vis-à-vis the goal of <b>undistorted</b> <b>competition,</b> the EU Commission has {{made an effort to}} remove non-competition goals from competition policy {{in the course of the}} “decentralization” of EU competition law enforcement and to refocus competition law on the efficiency criterion, namely the consumer welfare goal. This contribution shall discuss the regulation of the interface between competition policy and public policy goals in the interpretation and application of Art. 81 EC under the old and the new enforcement regime. Doctrinally, the debate is led on two levels: With regard to the interpretation of Art. 81 (1) the question is raised whether conflicting policy goals can delimit its scope. Art. 81 (3) with its broad and general terms, potentially provides an opening of EU competition law for the consideration of noncompetition related policy goals on the level of exemptions. The interpretation of Art. 81 (3) EC has gained new relevance since it has been declared directly applicable by Art. 1 of Regulation 1 / 2003. Whereas, under the former regime, the Commission could regulate the competition-public policy interface case-by-case based on its monopoly for granting exemptions, the direct applicability of Art. 81 (3), i. e. its enforcement by national competition authorities and courts, calls for more conceptual guidance. The difficulties to provide such guidance throw some light on the conceptual uncertainties associated with the recent reform of EU competition policy...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. This article {{shows how}} the {{substantive}} bias {{at the core of}} the present socio-economic constitution of the European Union is directly related to the characterization of economic freedoms (crucially, the right to freedom of establishment of corporations and the free movement of capital) as the key yardstick of European constitutionality. An empirically grounded reconstruction of the way in which the European Court of Justice applies the proportionality principle shows that the Luxembourg judges (1) assign the argumentative benefit to the holders of economic freedoms, (2) construct all other constitutional goods in the semblance of economic freedoms, and (3) use asymmetric proof standards when having to justify the adequacy and necessity of economic freedoms and other constitutional goods. As a result, under the cloth of projecting the way in which national constitutional courts review the constitutionality of legislation to the supranational level, the European Court of Justice has radically altered the substance of European constitutional law. In particular, the right to private property and entrepreneurial freedom (as operationalized through the four economic freedoms and the principle of <b>undistorted</b> <b>competition)</b> have been assigned an abstract and a concrete constitutional weight that places key public policies (social policies, tax policies, regulatory policies) off the realm of what is constitutionally possible. As a result, some of the collective goods {{at the core of the}} Democratic and Social Rechtsstaat have become extremely vulnerable. Focusing on the proportionality as practice by the European Court of Justice does not only provide us with insights into the nature and substance of European law, but also contributes to the general theoretical understanding of the principle of proportionality itself, in particular to a more detailed reconstruction of the relevant steps in proportionality review...|$|E

Uno de los problemas que plantean los contratos de licencia de marcas es la conciliación del interés de los contratantes con el Derecho de la competencia. Por un lado, es preciso garantizar a las partes la más amplia libertad contractual, al mismo tiempo que, no obstante, debe preservarse, por otro, la libre competencia en el mercado. El presente artículo constituye una aproximación al régimen de los contratos de licencia en dicho contexto, en el que la clave es encontrar el balance adecuado entre los legítimos intereses de los titulares de derechos sobre marcas y la protección de la competencia leal, dos conceptos que se complementan uno a otro y que constituyen elemento indispensable del mercado común Europeo. Licensing of trademarks is one of the areas where interests of trademark holders and competition rules overlap. On the one side, {{there is a need to}} guarantee to the parties the broadest possible freedom in shaping the licensing contract, on the other again, protection of other traders and of <b>undistorted</b> <b>competition</b> in the market remains the matter of concern for European authorities. The present paper provides an overview of the rules relating to trademark licensing agreements, as they were developed by the European institutions and shaped according to requirements of the EU competition law. It is to highlight the search for the right balance between legitimate interests of trademark holders and protection of fair competition, the two concepts which complement each other and which constitute an indispensable element of the Common Market...|$|E
40|$|From an {{economic}} perspective, {{the importance of}} EU state aid policy refers to correcting “market failure” situations that may occur in the economy, aiming at maintaining an <b>undistorted</b> <b>competition</b> in the economic environment. In {{the context of the}} Commission focusing its efforts towards promoting R&D investment through Europe 2020 strategy, Romania is a modest innovator and is facing a relatively low level of economic competitiveness. The present paper aims at providing a contribution to the literature on public policies to R&D in the EU, developing both a quantitative and a qualitative analysis of public policies to R&D in Romania {{in the context of the}} EU state aid policy. Our research hypothesis considers that public policies to R&D in Romania, as in other Central and Eastern European countries, are following a convergence process with the practices from the EU level. Based on data provided by Eurostat, we have stressed that the existing gap between the national level and the EU level tends to maintain in the state aid field even in the future, in spite of Romanian government sector R&D expenditure tending to converge with the EU level, which highlights the potential of catching up with the European model. We believe that the success of the convergence process will depend in the future, to a large extent, on the implementation of the modernised legal and institutional framework of state aid policy, as well as on the capacity to build consensus by policy makers around the necessity to structure future economic development around R&D investment. In order to successfully address these structural R&D problems, the National Strategy for Research, Development and Innovation aims to establish R&D as engine for increasing economic competitiveness, while at the same time strengthening strategic areas with comparative advantages, supporting public-private partnerships, funding clusters in areas of smart specialisation, developing intellectual property and marketing capacity for products and services etc. For a successful implementation of these initiatives, we believe there is a strong necessity for an integrative policy mix aiming at coordinating the innovative system as a whole and a consistent political vision to support economic competitiveness through R&D investment...|$|E
40|$|In {{economic}} terms, {{the importance}} of state aid policy refers to the maintaining of an <b>undistorted</b> <b>competition</b> and the correction of inherent Ã¢â‚¬Å“market failuresÃ¢â‚¬Â which may occur in the economy, aiming at increasing economic efficiency, based on the traditional assumption that an effective competition will {{have a positive impact}} on economic development. The main objective of the present paper is to establish a possible correlation between state aid to research and development (RnD) and GDP level in the EU. Our research hypothesis relates to considering state aid as a significant contribution to the economic development, measured by GDP level, which will be estimated as a function of state aid. Consequently, the main variables of this study are state aid to RnD and GDP level, considered in both relative and absolute terms. The relationship between technological change and economic development has been at the centre of the interest in both theoretical and empirical literature. The role of institutions and government policies in stimulating technological change has been provided mainly by the evolutionary theory, which considers economic development as a technological change driven process featured by a complex pattern which includes both uniformity and idiosyncrasy across time and countries. The relationship between these variables was estimated through a panel model which used seemly unrelated regression (SUR) and ordinary least squares estimation (OLS). Taking into account that the economic value is likely to be realized after the innovation process took place we have interpreted this economic aspect in an econometric sense by using time lags. In analysing the relative importance of state aid to RnD, we have proposed an index which evaluates the relation between state aid and the relative size of the Member StateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s economy. The relationship between state aid and GDP level was found to be positive and statistically significant, suggesting that state aid is positively correlated with economic development and showing that state aid programs tend to have an incentive effect for the economic activity after they have been granted, due to the spillover effect of RnD activities assumed by the government funding incorporated in the state aid projects. On the other hand, the analysis of state aid relative to GDP has demonstrated that significant levels of volatility indicate a persistence of disparities between Member States in the period considered (2004 - 2009), suggesting that national particularities remain an important determinant of government support through state aid, which implies the necessity of a better coordination in the economic policies targeting innovation in the Member States...|$|E
