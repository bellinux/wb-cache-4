5|$|After {{retiring}} from the post of Superior General of the Holy Ghost Fathers, Lefebvre was approached by traditionalists from the French Seminary in Rome who had been refused tonsure, the rite by which, until 1973, a seminarian became a cleric. They asked for a conservative seminary to complete their studies. After directing them to the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fribourg,</b> Switzerland, Lefebvre was urged to teach these seminarians personally.

25|$|Like the Traditionalist Catholic {{movement}} in general, the SSPX was {{born out of}} opposition to changes in the Catholic Church that followed the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965). The founder and central figure of the society was the French prelate Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, who had previously served the Catholic Church as apostolic delegate to French-speaking Africa, Archbishop of Dakar, and superior general of the Holy Ghost Fathers, a missionary order of priests. In May 1970, shortly after his retirement as Vicar General of the Holy Ghost Fathers, Lefebvre was approached by 11 French seminarians in Rome, who were criticized for their adherence to the traditional doctrines of the Catholic Church. They sought Lefebvre's advice on a conservative seminary where they could complete their studies. He directed them to the still conservative <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fribourg,</b> in Switzerland. But soon, the University had become as liberal as anywhere else.|$|E

500|$|In March 2006, Scalia gave a {{talk at the}} <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fribourg</b> in Switzerland, {{where he}} was asked about detainee rights. He responded, [...] "Give me a break... I had a son on that {{battlefield}} and they were shooting at my son, and I'm not about to give this man who was captured in a war a full jury trial. I mean it's crazy". Though Scalia was not referring to any particular individual, the Supreme Court was about to consider the case of Salim Ahmed Hamdan, supposed driver to Osama bin Laden, who was challenging the military commissions at Guantanamo Bay. A group of retired military officers that supported Hamdan's position asked Scalia to recuse himself, or step aside from hearing the case, which he declined to do. The Court held 5–3 in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld that the federal courts had jurisdiction to consider Hamdan's claims; Scalia, in dissent, contended that any Court authority to consider Hamdan's petition had been eliminated by the jurisdiction-stripping Detainee Treatment Act of 2005.|$|E

40|$|Armasuisse Science and Technology, the RandD {{agency for}} the Swiss Armed Forces, is {{developing}} a Social Media Analysis (SMA) system to help detect events such as natural disasters and terrorist activity by analysing Twitter posts. The system currently supports only keyword search, which cannot identify complex events such as ‘politician dying’ or ‘militia terror act’ since the keywords that correctly identify such events are typically unknown. In this paper we present ArmaTweet, an extension of SMA developed in a collaboration between armasuisse and the <b>Universities</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fribourg</b> and Oxford that supports semantic event detection. Our system extracts a structured representation from the tweets’ text using NLP technology, which it then integrates with DBpedia and WordNet in an RDF knowledge graph. Security analysts can thus describe the events of interest precisely and declaratively using SPARQL queries over the graph. Our experiments show that ArmaTweet can detect many complex events that cannot be detected by keywords alone...|$|R
