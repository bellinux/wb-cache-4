Inference of what effective e-learning activities are were traced during a focus group session, a question on a discussion list, validation of information from different sources such as observers, the verifier, the de-brief session, the scribe, the video and audio recordings and correlation with current literature. Effective learning (self-direction and collaboration), techno- and information literacy and an effective learning environment are the strongest predictors of effective e-learning. The combination of intention (motivation) and action (volition) are the two descriptive factors for conation.

40|$|AbstractExtension of an {{epithelial}} membrane {{to close}} a hole is a very widespread process both in morphogenesis and in tissue repair. In many circumstances an important component driving these movements is an actomyosin contraction which consists of meshworks of actin filaments cross-linked by Myosin II molecular motors. We introduce a mathematical model to simulate the contraction of an actin cable structure attached to an external epithelial tissue and we use this curvature-type model as a basis to build other models in more general settings. This result is obtained by adding extra terms that describe the particular process we want to model (lamellipodial crawling, granulation tissue contraction, extension of actin protrusions, epithelial resistance, etc.). Finally, we concentrate on the treatment of non-homogeneous forces, i. e.  non-constant boundary terms which {{can be associated with}} a non-uniform cable, <b>internal</b> <b>pull</b> or zipping force due to the non-uniformity of the biological or physical properties of the boundary cells or of the connective tissue...|$|R

40|$|The {{requirement}} of PTB, polypyrimidine tract binding protein, for internal initiation of translation {{has been tested}} using an RNA affinity column to deplete rabbit reticulocyte lysates of PTB. The affinity column was prepared by coupling CNBr-activated Sepharose with the segment of the 5 '-untranslated region of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) RNA previously shown to bind PTB. Lysates passed through this column were devoid of PTB, and were incapable of internal initiation of translation dependent on the EMCV 5 '-untranslated region, while retaining the capacity for translation dependent on ribosome scanning. Full activity for internal initiation was restored {{by the addition of}} recombinant PTB at the physiologically relevant concentration of about 5 micrograms/mL. When various PTB deletion mutants were tested, it was found that this activity required virtually the full-length protein. Thus, PTB is an essential protein for internal initiation promoted by the EMCV 5 '-untranslated region. However, the PTB-depleted lysate retained the capacity for internal initiation promoted by the 5 '-untranslated regions of another cardiovirus, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, and of the unrelated hepatitis C virus, and in neither case did addition of recombinant PTB stimulate internal initiation.

40|$|Picornavirus RNAs are {{translated}} by an unusual mechanism of internal ribosome entry {{that requires a}} substantial segment of the viral 5 '-untranslated region, generally known as the internal ribosome entry segment (IRES), and in some circumstances may require cellular trans-acting proteins, particularly polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB). It is shown here that for encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), the PTB dependence of IRES function in vitro is determined partly {{by the nature of}} the reporter cistron, and more especially by the size of an A-rich bulge in the IRES. With a wild-type EMCV IRES (which has a bulge of 6 As), translation is effectively independent of PTB provided the IRES is driving the synthesis of EMCV viral polyprotein. With an enlarged (7 A) bulge and heterologous reporters, translation is highly dependent on PTB. Intermediate levels of PTB dependence are seen with a 7 A bulge IRES driving viral polyprotein synthesis or a wild-type (6 A) bulge IRES linked to a heterologous reporter. None of these parameters influenced the binding of PTB to the high-affinity site in the IRES. These results argue that PTB is not an essential and <b>universal</b> <b>internal</b> initiation factor, but, rather, that when it is required, its binding to the IRES helps to maintain the appropriate higher-order structure and to reverse distortions caused, for example, by an enlarged A-rich bulge...|$|R

40|$|An {{overview}} {{of our current}} understanding of the formation and evolution of star clusters is given, with main emphasis on high-mass clusters. Clusters form deeply embedded within dense clouds of molecular gas. Left-over gas is cleared within a few million years and, depending on the efficiency of star formation, the clusters may disperse almost immediately or remain gravitationally bound. Current evi-dence suggests that a few percent of star formation occurs in clusters that remain bound, {{although it is not}} yet clear if this fraction is truly <b>universal.</b> <b>Internal</b> two-body relaxation and external shocks will lead to further, gradual dissolution on timescales of up to a few hundred million years for low-mass open clusters in the Milky Way, while the most massive clusters (> 105 M) have lifetimes comparable to or exceeding the age of the Universe. The low-mass end of the initial cluster mass function is well approximated by a power-law distribution, dN/dM ∝ M− 2, but there is mounting evidence that quiescent spiral discs form relatively few clusters with masses M> 2 × 105 M. In starburst galaxies and old globular cluster systems, this limit appears to be higher, at least several × 106 M. The difference is likely related to the higher gas densities and pressures in starburst galaxies, which allow denser, more massive giant molecular clouds to form. Low-mass clusters may thus trace star formation quite universally, while the more long-lived, massive clusters appear to form preferentially in the context of violent star formation...|$|R

Extensive arrays of pheromone traps monitor for reintroductions, but occasionally the traps collect nontarget weevils that can be misidentified by scouts. For example, the congeneric pepper weevil, Anthonomus eugenii Cano, and other superficially similar weevils are attracted to components of the boll weevil lure or trap color. Although morphologically distinguishable by trained personnel, the potential for misidentification is compounded when captured weevils are dismembered or partially consumed by ants or ground beetles that sometimes feed on them in the traps. Because misidentification can have expensive consequences, a molecular diagnostic tool would be of great value to eradication managers. We demonstrate that a cocktail of three primer pairs in a single polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplify species-specific microsatellites that unambiguously distinguish the boll weevil from three other weevil species tested, including pepper weevil; cranberry weevil, Anthonomus eugenii musculus Say; and pecan weevil, Curculio caryae Horn.

40|$|Connections between {{organizational}} {{engagement and}} internal communication have gained {{much interest in}} recent years, due to existing evidence suggesting that employees who engage with their organization affect organization’s effectiveness and that, in turn, internal communication can influence organizational engagement. However, {{there is little evidence}} about such connection seen from an employee perspective and therefore, this study sought to explore linkages between employee organizational engagement and internal communication, on the basis of experiences of employees. This thesis draws on theoretical concepts such as knowledge workers, internal communication and organizational engagement as well as on an empirical research inspired by principles of grounded theory. The research analyzed twelve semi-structured interviews to employees working for a global knowledge-based organization; aiming at exploring the factors that had the potential to influence their engagement with the organizational; their key expectations towards internal communication and the implications that their overall experiences suggest for the practice of internal communication.

40|$|ABSTRACTDuring {{the last}} decade, the {{application}} of both qualitative and quantitative nucleic acid detection techniques has had {{a major impact on}} diagnostics in clinical virology. Both signal and target amplification-based systems are currently used routinely in most if not all virology laboratories. However, commercial assays are only available for a very limited number of targets, and this has resulted in the development and introduction of assays developed in-house for most viral targets. With improved and automated nucleic acid sample isolation techniques, as well as real-time detection methods, a new generation of assays for most clinically important viruses is being developed. These technological improvements also make it possible to generate results with a very short turnaround time. As an example of a more individual-patient disease-management concept, we have introduced in our clinical setting the quantitative detection of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) in T-cell-depleted allogeneic stem cell transplant patients. This has enabled us to develop models for pre-emptive anti-B-cell immunotherapy for EBV reactivation, and for reducing not only the incidence of EBV lymphoproliferative disease (EBV-LPD), but the virus-related mortality. It is now also feasible to introduce molecular testing for those viruses that can easily be detected using classical virological methods, such as culture techniques or antigen detection. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the clinical importance of the additional positive samples detected. It should, however, be clear that a complete exchange of technology is unlikely to occur, and that complementary methods should stay operational, making possible the discovery of new viruses. Furthermore, the ability to characterise viruses more easily by sequencing opens new possibilities for epidemiological studies. There is also an urgent need, with regard to molecular diagnostic methods, for the introduction and use of standardised materials and participation in international quality control programmes. Finally, with the introduction of a <b>universal</b> <b>internal</b> control throughout the whole procedure, the accuracy of the results generated is warranted...|$|R
