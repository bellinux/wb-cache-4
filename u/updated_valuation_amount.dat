The main method used in valuation is the discounted cash flow (free cash flow to firm), supported by the relative valuation of a peer group of companies.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Risk Analysis)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. In South Africa various {{financial}} institutions and independent vendors have developed residential property valuation models to estimate the current value of historically traded properties. A natural extension to these models has been to develop historical property price indices. In this dissertation, {{three of the four}} approaches to developing property price indices will be examined. Through back–testing and other statistical methods, the most accurate and robust approach will be determined. The four major approaches available are the mean valuation per suburb, the median valuation per suburb, the repeat sales approach and hedonic regression. The mean valuation per suburb approach can be biased because of outliers in property prices. However, outliers in property prices will not influence the median valuation per suburb approach, but in cases where property values in a suburb have a skewed distribution, the <b>valuation</b> <b>amount</b> could be distorted. Neither of the above mentioned shortcomings influences the repeat sales or the hedonic regression approach. To follow the hedonic regression approach, the characteristics of the property need to be known. In South Africa, however, the available property data lacks detailed characteristics of traded properties. This dissertation will therefore focus on the first three methods. The repeat sales approach measures the growth in property prices by applying a generalized linear model to properties that have traded more than once. This approach is only possible if there is a representative amount of repeat sales able to fit a model. The focus of this project will be on the repeat sales approach, but all three the approaches discussed will be analysed to prove that the repeat sales approach is the most accurate in developing a property price index for properties in South Africa.

Research is focused on the problem of validity of different analytical models which is defined by the ability of a model to produce fundamental valuations closely connected with market valuations of equity. This paper investigates versions of residual income model (RIM) under different modifications of linear information dynamics (LID). All models developed in this paper are tested on the data of Russian stock market from 2000 to 2005 year, which was booming during this period. Results showed that accounting-based valuation models have good explanation characteristics on Russian emerging market. The version of RIM which rests on assumption that investors base their expectations about future amounts of net income totally on current net incomes gives highest correlation between fundamental and market <b>valuations</b> of equity <b>amounted</b> to R-square 0, 83. The version of RIM which rests on assumption that investors base their expectations about future amounts of residual earnings totally on current residual earnings gives correlation between fundamental and market <b>valuations</b> of equity <b>amounted</b> to R-square 0, 78. These results could prove a hypothesis about opacity of emerging markets: on these markets investors base their expectations mainly on current information which is available and relevant for forecasting. ...|$|R

40|$|Many {{services}} like car repair, medical, legal and consultant services have the {{characteristic of a}} credence good: The customers cannot verify, even ex post, whether the amount of prescribed service was appropriate or not. This may create an incentive to provide unnecessary services, that is, the expert may perform extra service that is of no value to the customer, but that allows the expert to increase his revenues. This is called demand inducement. Rational customers process ex ante the incentive of the expert to advise unnecessary service and <b>update</b> their <b>valuation</b> of the service accordingly. A low workload level (an idling expert), combined with a fee per unit of service time, may indicate that the expert has a high incentive to prescribe unnecessary service. On the other hand, a high workload level (a busy expert), or a fixed fee independent of the actual service time may indicate that the expert has little incentive to perform unnecessary service. When the arrival rate of potential customers is stochastic and the (true) service time is also stochastic, the workload level of the expert changes dynamically over time, and impacts an arriving customer’s valuation and hence his decision to seek service or not.

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 Contingent {{valuation}} {{has been}} used to elicit values for changes in {{the quantity and quality of}} nonmarket amenities. Yet hypothetically trading dollars for environmental improvements is not a familiar activity for most survey respondents. A variety of response effects associated with survey collected data can potentially lead to biased contingent valuation welfare estimates. A discussion concerning how respondent values are formulated and reported provides the basis for building a behavioral model of decision making. Individuals are presumed to act like Bayesians, incorporating information where available to update their prior outlooks. This behavioral model is linked to the iterated referendum-contingent valuation format to test for the presence of a type of information bias. The iterated referendum format poses successive valuation questions to survey participants with the second question based on the response to the first. Although this format has been shown to yield an increase in precision over the single question referendum, the validity of the iterated referendum has not been empirically verified. The central research question is whether the initial bid provides respondents with a stimulus to revise or <b>update</b> their <b>valuations.</b> A test for the constancy of respondents' distribution of willingness-to-pay indicates that updating is occurring in two large data sets. Welfare benefits measures are estimated for the single question and for two forms of the iterated referendum format. Nonparametric tests indicate that the behavioral model differs statistically from the two other valuation formats. The iterated referendum welfare estimate derived from the Bayesian behavioral model yields larger and less precise welfare benefits estimates than the standard iterated referendum for the two data sets. The Bayesian structure of the iterated referendum provides a conceptually valid valuation format. It is both a statistical improvement and a more realistic model of decision making...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three research papers on cheap talk game and satisficing behaviour. The first chapter examines the potential for communication via cheap talk between an expert and a decision maker whose type (preferences) is uncertain. The expert privately observes states {{for each type of}} the decision maker and wants to persuade the decision maker to choose an action in his favour by informing her of the states. The decision maker privately observes her type and chooses an action. An optimal action for the decision maker depends upon both her type and type-specific states. In equilibrium the expert can always inform the decision maker in the form of comparative statements and the decision maker also can partially reveal her type to the expert or public. The second and third chapters build a dynamic model of satisficing behaviour in which an agent’s “expected” payoff is explicitly introduced, where this expectation is adaptively formed. If the agent receives a payoff above her satisficing level she continues with the current action, <b>updating</b> her <b>valuation</b> of the action. If she receives a payoff below her satisficing level and her valuation falls below her satisficing level she updates both her action and satisficing level. In the second chapter, we find that in the long run, all players satisfice. In individual decision problems, satisficing behaviour results in cautious, maximin choice and in normal form games like the Prisoner’s Dilemma and Stag Hunt, they in the long run play either cooperative or defective outcomes conditional on past plays. In coordination games like the Battle of the Sexes, Choosing Sides and Common Interest, they in the long run coordinate on Pareto optimal outcomes. In the third chapter, we find that satisficing players in the long run play subgame dominant paths, which is a refinement of subgame perfection, and identify conditions with which they ‘always cooperate’ or ‘fairly coordinate’ in repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma and Battle of the Sexes games, respectively, and truthfully communicate in sender-receiver games.
