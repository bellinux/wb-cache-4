5|$|A young Addie (Katelyn Reed) stares <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> old mansion {{when two}} {{troublesome}} twins Brian and Troy (Kai and Bodhi Schulz) arrive, planning {{to enter the}} house. Addie warns them not to enter the house, but they ignore her warning and enter the house anyway. While they wreak havoc, Brian discovers a dying animal and the twins find an open door to the basement. They enter the basement where they find jars containing animal remains and human fetuses. After complaining about the smell, Brian leaves the basement {{only to find that}} his brother has gone silent. He searches for him and finds him with his throat slit, gasping for air. The Infantata (Ben Woolf) appears behind him and kills him off screen.|$|E
5|$|Having survived {{until the}} end of the time stop, the LEP is bound by law and leaves the {{remaining}} gold and departs. At the end, Butler demands an explanation as to how Artemis came up with the idea of using sleeping pills. Artemis explains that he had gotten the idea from old fairy tales, in which human characters never wake <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> inopportune moment for the fairies, and had guessed that time-stops were the reason. Concluding that the time-stop forces a being to stay in whichever state of consciousness they were in when the time-stop is started, Artemis uses sleeping pills to break out of the time-stop. Artemis finds his mother has fully recovered from her insanity thanks to Holly's magic.|$|E

5|$|Heinrich Kreutz {{studied the}} orbits of the three great comets, and {{developed}} {{the idea that the}} three comets were fragments of a much larger progenitor comet which had broken <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> earlier perihelion passage. The fragmentation of the Great Comet of 1882 itself demonstrated that this was plausible. It is now thought that the Great Comet of 1882 is a fragment of X/1106 C1, and that Comet du Toit (C/1945 X1) and Comet Ikeya–Seki (C/1965 S1) are two of its sister fragments.|$|E

25|$|Hindlekar toured England in 1936 and 1946 as India's first-choice wicket-keeper. A {{right-handed}} batsman, he {{wore his}} cap at a 'bewildered angle' and 'stood with his toes pointing <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> angle of 45 degrees'. He opened in the First Test at Lord's in 1936, but chipped a bone in his finger and suffered from blurred vision. This injury and his subsequent exclusion from the next Test led to the famous opening partnership between Vijay Merchant and Mushtaq Ali.|$|E

They went to England, where Sally {{gave birth to a}} baby girl. However, Seary and Sally split <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> early stage and Seary returned to Australia in 1976.|$|E

Two MQ-1s were loaded into a Boeing C-17 Globemaster III in a cradle system that also carried a control terminal, {{maintenance}} tent, and the crew. The test was to prove the UAVs could be deployed and set <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> expeditionary base within four hours of landing. In a recent undisclosed deployment, airmen set up a portable hangar in a tent and a wooden taxiway to operate MQ-1s for a six-week period.|$|E
25|$|Following World War I, {{the number}} of users rose sharply and by 1926 the DZB had 3,500 users. The Great Depression forced the library into a rigid austerity, {{resulting}} in budget cuts and layoffs. In 1935 the DZB moved into the commercial publishing house Druckhaus Klepzig on the Täubchenweg in Leipzig. This building was later destroyed in an Allied bombing raid in December 1943 and over 30,000 of the library's books were lost. What little remained of the collection was set <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> alternative site at Döbeln in 1944.|$|E
25|$|When {{academics}} {{talk about}} coordination failure, most cases are that subjects achieve risk dominance rather than payoff dominance. Even when payoffs are better when players coordinate on one equilibrium, many times people will choose the less risky option {{where they are}} guaranteed some payoff and end <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> equilibrium that has sub-optimal payoff. Players {{are more likely to}} fail to coordinate on a riskier option when the difference between taking the risk or the safe option is smaller. The laboratory results suggest that coordination failure is a common phenomenon in the setting of order-statistic games and stag-hunt games.|$|E

He then flips out and reminds {{her that she had}} rebuffed him the weekend before and {{therefore}} believes she is playing games, then drives her home. Instead of going inside, she takes a walk and ends <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> all-night cafe. As she walks by, she sees Michael Fitzsimmons — the artsy loner in school she always wished she’d slept with - and goes in to talk to him. After finding out they have more in common than originally thought, they ride off on his motorcycle. In a field, they smoke weed and find out more about one another. When he asks if she is going to marry Charlie, she responds that she already did that and will not do it again. After he recites some of his poetry for her, they have sex.|$|E
25|$|The {{policy of}} {{non-alignment}} during the Cold War meant that Nehru received financial and technical support from both power blocs in building India's industrial base from scratch. Steel mill complexes were built at Bokaro and Rourkela with {{assistance from the}} Soviet Union and West Germany. There was substantial industrial development. Industry grew 7.0 percent annually between 1950 and 1965 – almost trebling industrial output and making India the world's seventh largest industrial country. Nehru's critics, however, contended that India's import substitution industrialisation, which was continued long after the Nehru era, weakened the international competitiveness of its manufacturing industries. India's share of world trade fell from 1.4 per cent in 1951–1960 to 0.5 per cent over 1981–1990. On the other hand, India's export performance is argued to have actually showed sustained improvement over the period. The volume of exports went <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> annual rate of 2.9 per cent in 1951–1960 to 7.6 per cent in 1971–1980.|$|E

He said that hypocrisy was [...] "at the top of the list" [...] of the themes he wanted to explore in the story.
