The population density was fixed at 24 plants per pot in either treatment. Soil moisture acted as linear factor and optimum factor on dry matter productions and leaf area developments of upland rice and sorghum, respectively. The uppermost limit value of <b>unavailable</b> <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> ratio (fo) was higher in upland rice than in sorghum. From these results, it was, in general, concluded that sorghum and upland rice were in possession of the larger drought tolerance and excess-moisture endurance than upland rice and sorghum, respectively. The effect of soil moisture upon leaf area development was expressed comparatively through leaf number in upland rice and through leaf area per one leaf in sorghum. The relative growth rate (RGR) was affected comparatively through leaf area ratio (LAR) in upland rice and net assimilation rate (NAR) in sorghum. The water use efficiency (WUE) was 3. 6 and 8. 3 in upland rice and sorghum, independently of soil moisture conditions excepting that sorghum's WUE fell to 6. 4 under an excess-moisture condition. The relative advantage of mixed-cropping could not be recognized in the present experiment at all. Although fo and optimum soil moisture ratio (fopt) of total in sorghum-upland rice mixture were lower and higher than fo of sole upland rice and fopt of sole sorghum, they were higher and lower than fo of sole sorghum and fopt of sole upland rice, respectively. The basic relationships, as observed in pure stand, between soil moisture ratio, and dry matter productions, leaf area developments and growth functions weren't affected by mixture stand. WUE was also constant in both cropping systems. Although there were evidences that component crops were competing for a environmental resource in mixed stand, {{it was expected that}} it was not a competition for water but one for light. From above-mentioned results, it was concluded that sorghum-upland rice mixture stand should contribute little to the improved stability to soil moisture. If sorghum-upland rice mixture should give the stability and yield advantages under field condition, it seemed to be attributable to the more efficient soil moisture extraction resulting from complementarity of the rooting depth...|$|E

High spatial resolution <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> was surveyed in ten different field campaigns using a proximal ground penetrating radar (GPR) mounted on a mobile platform. Based on these <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> measurements, seven scenarios of spatial structures of antecedent <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> were used and linked with a field scale distributed hydrological model to simulate field scale runoff. Accounting for spatial variability of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> resulted in general in higher predicted field scale runoff as compared to the case where <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> was kept constant. The ranges of possible hydrographs were delineated by extreme scenarios where <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> was directly and inversely modelled according to the topographic wetness index (TWI). These behaviours could be explained by the sizes and locations of runoff contributing areas, knowing that runoff was generated by infiltration excess over a certain <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> threshold.

(1999) proposed that evaporation is related to changes in the resistance to evaporation in a particular soil type, the amount of energy available to drive the evaporative process and the amount of water available to evaporate.|$|R
40|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>moisture</b> {{is highly}} {{variable}} both spatially and temporally. It is widely recognized that improving {{the knowledge and}} understanding of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> and the processes underpinning its spatial and temporal distribution is critical. This paper addresses the relationship between near-surface and root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture,</b> {{the way in which they}} vary spatially and temporally, and the effect of sampling design for determining catchment scale <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> dynamics. In this study, catchment scale nearsurface (0 – 50 mm) and root zone (0 – 300 mm) <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> were monitored over a four-week period. Measurements of near-surface <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> were recorded at various resolutions, and near-surface and root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> data were also monitored continuously within a network of recording sensors. Catchment average near-surface <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> derived from detailed spatial measurements and continuous observations at fixed points were found to be significantly correlated (r² = 0. 96; P = 0. 0063; n = 4). Root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> was also found to be highly correlated with catchment average near-surface, continuously monitored (r² = 0. 81; P < 0. 0001; n = 26) and with detailed spatial measurements of near-surface <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> (r² = 0. 84). The weaker relationship observed between near-surface and root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> is considered to be caused by the different responses to rainfall and the different factors controlling <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> for the <b>soil</b> depths of 0 – 50 mm and 0 – 300 mm. Aspect is considered to be the main factor influencing the spatial and temporal distribution of near-surface <b>soil</b> <b>moisture,</b> while topography and soil type are considered important for root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture.</b> The ability of a limited number of monitoring stations to provide accurate estimates of catchment scale average <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> for both near-surface and root zone is thus demonstrated, as opposed to high resolution spatial measurements. Similarly, the use of near-surface <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> measurements to obtain a reliable estimate of deeper <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> levels at the small catchment scale was demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>moisture</b> is an {{essential}} climate variable influencing land atmosphere interactions, {{an essential}} hydrologic variable impacting rainfall runoff processes, an essential ecological variable regulating net ecosystem exchange, and an essential agricultural variable constraining food security. Large-scale <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> monitoring has advanced in recent years creating opportunities to transform scientific understanding of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> and related processes. These advances are being driven by researchers from {{a broad range of}} disciplines, but this complicates collaboration and communication. For some applications, the science required to utilize large-scale <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> data is poorly developed. In this review, we describe {{the state of the art}} in large-scale <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> monitoring and identify some critical needs for research to optimize the use of increasingly available <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> data. We review representative examples of 1) emerging in situ and proximal sensing techniques, 2) dedicated <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> remote sensing missions, 3) <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> monitoring networks, and 4) applications of large-scale <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> measurements. Significant near-term progress seems possible in the use of large-scale <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> data for drought monitoring. Assimilation of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> data for meteorological or hydrologic forecasting also shows promise, but significant challenges related to model structures and model errors remain.

40|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>moisture</b> is {{important}} for plant growth in semi-arid ecosystems. In this study, spatial variations in <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> at depths of 0 - 6 m on seven hillslopes of China&# 39;s Loess Plateau planted with korshinsk peashrub were analyzed based on <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> observations. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare the spatial patterns in <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> in shallow and deep soil layers at the hillslope scale under the influence of large-scale vegetation restoration. The results showed that: (1) the topographic wetness index was positively correlated with <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> near the surface (0 - 1 m), but negatively correlated with <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> at depths below 2 m; and (2) the negative relationship was found between biomass and <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> content in deep layers. <b>Soil</b> <b>moisture</b> in shallow layers was more likely to be affected by topographic factors. However, comparisons of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> at different slope positions indicated that the effect of topographic factors on the variability of deep <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> was altered, mainly because plants with different biomasses may differ in their consumption of soil water and thus cause greater spatial variations in deep <b>soil</b> <b>moisture.</b> The introduced vegetation may alter the spatial pattern of deep <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> influenced by topographic factors at the hillslope scale, and the biomass may have a determining role in the spatial variation of deep-layer <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> content.

40|$|AbstractAccurate <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> {{information}} {{is critically important}} for hydrological modelling and natural hazards (landslide & debris flow). However, its effective utilisation in those areas is still {{in a state of}} infancy. This paper focuses on exploring the advances and potential issues in current application of satellite <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> observations in hydrological modelling. It has proposed that hydrological application of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> data requires two inter-connected components: 1) <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> data relevant to hydrology, and 2) appropriate hydrological model structure compatible with such data. In order to meet these two requirements, the following three research tasks are suggested: the first is to carry out comprehensive evaluations of satellite <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> observations for hydrological modelling; the second is that the <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> representations in hydrological models may need to be modified so that they are more compatible with the real field <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> variations; and the third is that a <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> product (i. e., <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> deficit) directly applicable to hydrological modelling should be developed...|$|R
40|$|Several studies {{currently}} {{strive to}} improve the spatial resolution of coarse scale high temporal resolution global <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> products of the satellite missions SMOS (<b>Soil</b> <b>Moisture</b> and Ocean Salinity), SMAP (<b>Soil</b> <b>Moisture</b> Active and Passive) and ASCAT (Advanced Scatterometer). Soil texture heterogeneity {{is known to be}} one of the main sources of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> spatial variability. With the recent development of high resolution maps of basic soil properties such as soil texture and bulk density, relevant information to estimate <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> variability within a satellite product grid cell is available. Here, we predict for each SMOS, SMAP and ASCAT grid cell the sub-grid <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> variability. The approach is based on a method that predicts the <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> standard deviation as a function of the mean <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> based on <b>soil</b> texture information. It is a closed-form expression using stochastic analysis of 1 D unsaturated gravitational flow in an infinitely long vertical profile based on the Mualem-van Genuchten model and first-order Taylor expansions. We provide a look-up table map that indicates the <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> standard deviation for any given <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> mean. The resulting data set helps identifying adequate regions to validate coarse scale <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> products by providing a measure of representativeness of small-scale measurements for the coarse grid cell.

40|$|Identifying and {{understanding}} the impact of within-field <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> patterns is currently limited by the time and resources required to do sufficient monitoring. The spatial and temporal variance of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> complicates the ability to monitor and effectively predict <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> values. Remote sensing offers non-invasive techniques to measure <b>soil</b> <b>moisture,</b> but the resolution is too coarse to be of immediate value {{in many of the}} applications requiring <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> information. Obtaining high resolution <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> data requires dense sensor networks to adequately monitor changing spatial and temporal <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> patterns. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop methods to estimate <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> values at the field scale without the need for exhaustive pre-sampling. This is achieved by finding critical sampling locations within the field based upon topographic and soils data that can adequately predict field scale <b>soil</b> <b>moisture.</b> Given these sampling locations and values for <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> at those points, an interpolation method is developed that is independent of the spatial relationship between the sampling locations and the points to be interpolated.

40|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>moisture</b> plays a {{critical}} role in land surface processes and as such there has been a recent increase in the number and resolution of satellite <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> observations and the development of land surface process models with ever increasing resolution. Despite these developments, validation and calibration of these products has been limited {{because of a lack of}} observations on corresponding scales. A recently developed mobile <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> monitoring platform, known as the rover, offers opportunities to overcome this scale issue. This paper describes methods, results and testing of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> estimates produced using rover surveys on a range of scales that are commensurate with model and satellite retrievals. Our investigation involved static cosmic-ray neutron sensors and rover surveys across both broad (36  ×[*] 36  km at 9  km resolution) and intensive (10  ×[*] 10  km at 1  km resolution) scales in a cropping district in the Mallee region of Victoria, Australia. We describe approaches for converting rover survey neutron counts to <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> and discuss the factors controlling <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> variability. We use independent gravimetric and modelled <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> estimates collected across both space and time to validate rover <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> products. Measurements revealed that temporal patterns in <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> were preserved through time and regression modelling approaches were utilised to produce time series of property-scale <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> which may also have applications in calibration and validation studies or local farm management. Intensive-scale rover surveys produced reliable <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> estimates at 1  km resolution while broad-scale surveys produced <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> estimates at 9  km resolution. We conclude that the multiscale <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> products produced in this study are well suited to future analysis of satellite <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> retrievals and finer-scale <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> models...|$|R

Comparison between results with and without the assimilation of remotely sensed <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> data demonstrates that with <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> assimilated into SAMIL, the land-sea thermal contrast during pre-monsoon seasons is more realistic.
