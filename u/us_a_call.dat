60|$|We {{had heard}} that he meditated a visit, and {{suspected}} what he was after. Being upon the consul's hands, all our expenses were of course payable by him in his official capacity; and, therefore, {{as a friend of}} Wilson, and sure of good pay, the shore doctor had some idea of allowing us to run up a bill with him. True, it was rather awkward to ask us to take medicines which, on board the ship, he told us were not needed. However, he resolved to put a bold face on the matter, and give <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>call.</b>|$|E

They knew him too, and one of them set up a shrill laugh. [...] "Hello, Johnny! That you? You don't say so? What you up for this time? Going down to the Island? Well, give <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> there! Do be sociable! Ward 11's the address." [...] The other one laughed, and then swore at the first for trying to push her off the seat.|$|E

6000|$|I {{was very}} tired when I lay down, but {{so full of}} {{excitement}} that sleep did not soon visit my eyelids. The talk about buffalo, wild-horse hunters, lions and dogs, the prospect of hard riding and unusual adventure; the vision of Old Tom that {{had already begun to}} haunt me, filled my mind with pictures and fancies. The other fellows dropped off to sleep, and quiet reigned. Suddenly a succession of queer, sharp barks came from the plain, close to the cabin. Coyotes were paying <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>call,</b> and judging from the chorus of yelps and howls from our dogs, it was not a welcome visit. Above the medley rose one big, deep, full voice that I knew at once belonged to Sounder. Then all was quiet again. Sleep gradually benumbed my senses. Vague phrases dreamily drifted to and fro in my mind: [...] "Jones's wild range--Old Tom--Sounder--great name--great voice--Sounder! Sounder! Sounder--" ...|$|E
60|$|Neb gave <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> at daylight. The {{wind was}} fresh at west-north-west, but {{the tide was}} just {{beginning}} to run on the flood. I was so impatient to be rid of my guests, that all hands were called immediately, and we got the sloop under-way. The pilot professed himself willing to beat up through the narrow passages above, and, the Wallingford's greatest performance being on the wind, I was determined to achieve my deliverance that very tide. The sloop drew more water than was usual for the up-river craft, it is true, but she was light, and, just at the moment, could go wherever the loaded Albany vessels went. Those were not the days of vast public works; and as for sea-going craft, none had ever crossed the Overslaugh, so far as had come to my knowledge. Times have changed greatly, since; but the reader will remember I am writing of that remote period in American history, the year of our Lord 1803.|$|E
60|$|September 27th.--Yesterday, {{much earlier}} than English people ever do such things, General ------ made <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> {{on his way to}} the Consulate, and sat talking a {{stricken}} hour or thereabouts. Scarcely had he gone when Mrs. Oakford and her daughter came. After sitting a long while, they took U---- to their house, near St. John's Wood, to spend the night. I had been writing my journal and official correspondence during such intervals as these calls left me; and now, concluding these businesses, S-----, J-----, and I went out and took a cab for the terminus of the Crystal Palace Railway, whither we proceeded over Waterloo Bridge, and reached the palace not far from three o'clock. It was a beautifully bright day, such as we have in wonderful succession this month. The Crystal Palace gleamed in the sunshine; but I do not think a very impressive edifice can be built of glass,--light and airy, to be sure, but still it will be no other than an overgrown conservatory. It is unlike anything else in England; uncongenial with the English character, without privacy, destitute of mass, weight, and shadow, unsusceptible of ivy, lichens, or any mellowness from age.|$|E

6000|$|I proceed more {{particularly}} {{to examine the}} nature of that second kind of beauty of which I spoke in the third chapter, as consisting in [...] "the appearance of felicitous fulfilment of function in living things." [...] I have already noticed the example of very pure and high typical beauty which {{is to be found in}} the lines and gradations of unsullied snow: if, passing to the edge of a sheet of it, upon the lower Alps, early in May, we find, as we are nearly sure to find, two or three little round openings pierced in it, and through these emergent, a slender, pensive, fragile flower[31] whose small dark, purple-fringed bell hangs down and shudders over the icy cleft that it has cloven, as if partly wondering at its own recent grave, and partly dying of very fatigue after its hard won victory; we shall be, or we ought to be, moved by a totally different impression of loveliness from that which we receive among the dead ice and the idle clouds. There is now uttered to <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> for sympathy, now offered to us an image of moral purpose and achievement, which, however unconscious or senseless the creature may indeed be that so seems to call, cannot be heard without affection, nor contemplated without worship, by any of us whose heart is rightly tuned, or whose mind is clearly and surely sighted.|$|E
6000|$|... 54. In {{the range}} of {{inorganic}} nature I doubt if any object can be found more perfectly beautiful, than a fresh, deep snow-drift, seen under warm light. Its curves are of inconceivable perfection and changefulness; its surface and transparency alike exquisite; its light and shade of inexhaustible variety and inimitable finish,--the shadows sharp, pale, and of heavenly colour, the reflected lights intense and multitudinous, and mingled with the sweet occurrences of transmitted light.... If, passing {{to the edge of}} a sheet of it upon the lower Alps, early in May, we find, as we are nearly sure to find, two or three little round openings pierced in it; and through these, emergent, a slender, pensive, fragile flower,[28] whose small, dark, purple-fringed bell hangs down and shudders over the icy cleft that it has cloven, as if partly wondering at its own recent grave, and partly dying of very fatigue after its hard-won victory; we shall be, or we ought to be, moved by a totally different impression of loveliness from that which we receive among the dead ice and the idle clouds: there is now uttered to <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> for sympathy, now offered to us an image of moral purpose and achievement, which, however unconscious or senseless the creature may indeed be that so seems to call, cannot be heard without affection, nor contemplated without worship, by any of us whose heart is rightly turned, or whose mind is clearly and surely sighted.|$|E
