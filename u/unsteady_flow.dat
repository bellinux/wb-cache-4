The dual time-stepping strategy is always {{used in the}} approaches of <b>unsteady</b> <b>flows,</b> {{and the ability of}} dual time-stepping to accelerate the computation with acceptable error tolerance is evident. In our paper, we adopt the techniques of dual time-stepping methods for implicit gas-kinetic scheme to simulate the <b>unsteady</b> <b>flows,</b> which is very popular for the numerical methods based on the Navier-Stokes equations. It is carried out by (a) solving the gas-kinetic scheme in finite volume method; (b) obtaining the inviscid flux Jacobian by Roe scheme; (c) involving the computation of viscous flux Jacobian which is not mentioned in the previous implicit gas-kinetic schemes; (d) approximating the linear system of pseudo steady state by generalized minimal residual algorithm (GMRES). The explicit gas-kinetic scheme has been proved to be an accurate approach for both the steady and <b>unsteady</b> <b>flows,</b> and the implicit gas-kinetic scheme is also be developed to accelerate the convergence of steady state.

The workshop followed the theme, venue, and informal format of four earlier workshops: Minnowbrook I (1993), Minnowbrook II (1997), Minnowbrook III (2000), and Minnowbrook IV (2003). The workshop was focused on physical understanding of <b>unsteady</b> <b>flows</b> in turbomachinery, with the specific goal of contributing to engineering application of improving design codes for turbomachinery. The workshop participants included academic researchers from the United States and abroad and representatives from the gas-turbine industry and U. S. Government laboratories.
