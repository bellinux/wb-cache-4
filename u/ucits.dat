25|$|A {{synthetic}} ETF has counterparty risk, {{because the}} counterparty is contractually obligated {{to match the}} return on the index. The deal is arranged with collateral posted by the swap counterparty. A potential hazard is that the investment bank offering the ETF might post its own collateral, and that collateral could be of dubious quality. Furthermore, the investment bank could use its own trading desk as counterparty. These types of set-ups are not allowed under the European guidelines, Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (<b>UCITS),</b> so the investor should look for <b>UCITS</b> III-compliant funds.|$|E

2500|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} governance standards are rights vote for {{who is on the}} board of directors for investors of labour and capital. A Draft Fifth Company Law Directive proposed in 1972, which would have required EU-wide rights for employees to vote for boards stalled mainly because it attempted to require two-tier board structures, although most EU member states have codetermination today with unified boards. The Shareholder Rights Directive 2007 requires shareholders be able to make proposals, ask questions at meetings, vote by proxy and vote through intermediaries. This has become increasingly important as most company shares are held by institutional investors (primarily asset managers or banks, depending on the member state) who are holding [...] "other people's money". A large proportion of this money comes from employees and other people saving for retirement, but who do not have an effective voice. Unlike Switzerland after a 2013 people's initiative, or the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act 2010 in relation to brokers, the EU has not yet prevented intermediaries casting votes without express instructions of beneficiaries. This concentrates power into a small number of financial institutions, and creates the potential for conflicts of interest where financial institutions sell retirement, banking or products to companies in which they cast votes with other people's money. A series of rights for ultimate investors exist in the Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision Directive 2003. This requires duties of disclosure in how a retirement fund is run, funding and insurance to guard against insolvency, but not yet that voting rights are only cast on the instructions of investors. By contrast, the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive 2009 does suggest that investors in a mutual fund or ("collective investment scheme") should control the voting rights. The <b>UCITS</b> Directive 2009 is primarily concerned with creating a [...] "passport". If a firm complies with rules on authorisation, and governance of the management and investment companies in an overall fund structure, it can sell its shares in a collective investment scheme across the EU. This forms a broader package of Directives on securities and financial market regulation, much of which has been shaped by experience in the banking crisis of 2007–08. Additional rules on remuneration practices, separating depositary bodies in firms from management and investment companies, and more penalties for violations were inserted in 2014. These measures are meant to decrease the risk to investors that an investment goes insolvent. The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2004 applies to other businesses selling financial instruments. It requires similar authorisation procedures to have a [...] "passport" [...] to sell in any EU country, and transparency of financial contracts through duties to disclose material information about products being sold, including disclosure of potential conflicts of interest with clients. The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive 2011 applies to firms with massive quantities of capital, over €100million, essentially hedge funds and private equity firms. Similarly, it requires authorisation to sell products EU wide, and then basic transparency requirements on products being sold, requirements in remuneration policies for fund managers that are perceived to reduce [...] "risk" [...] or make pay [...] "performance" [...] related. They do not, however, require limits to pay. There are general prohibitions on conflicts of interest, and specialised prohibitions on asset stripping. The Solvency II Directive 2009 is directed particularly at insurance firms, requiring minimum capital and best practices in valuation of assets, again to avoid insolvency. The Capital Requirements Directives contain analogous rules, with a similar goals, for banks. To administer the new rules, the European System of Financial Supervision was established in 2011, and consists of three main branches: the European Securities and Markets Authority in Paris, the European Banking Authority in London and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority in Frankfurt.|$|E

According to the episodes of stone formation per year, we identified 51 recurrent stone formers (RSF) and 22 single stone formers (SSF). 20 normal adult males constituted the control group (C). uCa and uOx were higher in RSF than in C, but quite similar in SSF and RSF. The only difference between RSF and SSF was <b>uCit,</b> significantly lower (2. 06 +/- 1. 04 mmol/ 24 h) in RSF than in SSF (3. 22 +/- 1. 18 mmol/ 24 h, p less than 0. 001) and in C (3. 42 +/- 1. 33 mmol/ 24 h, p less than 0. 001). Hypocitraturia (<b>uCit</b> less than 1. 5 mmol/ 24 h) was found in 16 of 51 RSF (31. 4 %) and in 1 of 22 SSF (4. 5 %).

40|$|International audienceWe {{report in}} this paper an {{original}} and simple method for the grafting of polymer chains oncolloidal silica particles. We first synthesize an alkoxyamine bi-functional initiator, by coupling 2 -methyl- 2 -[N-tert-butyl-N-(dimethoxyphosphoryl- 2, 2 -dimethylpropyl) aminoxy]propionic acid(MAMA) and an acrylate coupling agent, 3 -(trimethoxysilyl) propyl acrylate (TPMA). Based onthe fact that MAMA dissociates at 25 uC, but activates polymerization of acrylates at only 110 <b>uC,it</b> is possible to stop the reaction after the insertion of only one CLC acrylate double bond, in thetemperature range 25 – 80 uC. This synthetic methodology is called ‘‘in situ thermo-dependanttrapping of carbon radicals’’. The ‘‘new’’ initiator obtained at that stage is then grafted on Sto¨ bersilica particles, by simple condensation of its alkoxysilane functions. We show that the initiatorgraftingdensity is {{twice as high as}} the value obtained by our first approach of ‘‘trapping of carbonradicals’’. The last step of the synthesis process is the grafting from polymerization ofpolybutylacrylate (PBA). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and small-angleneutron scattering (SANS) spectra show that the PBA-grafted silica particles are spherical, with anarrow size distribution, and do not form aggregates. Moreover, by this versatile route, thegrafted polymer density, the molecular weight and therefore the polymer-layer morphology, canbe easily controlled and tuned. It can also be extended to other monomers that work well withSG 1 nitroxide...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} urinary tract infection (UTI) and urinary metabolites. Material and Method: Eighty children aged below 14 years old who were following for recurrent UTI were enrolled into the study. Urinary calcium (Uca), oxalate (Uox), citrate (<b>Ucit)</b> and cysteine (Ucis) levels were studied in 24 hours urine samples. Hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria and hypocitraturia were identified according to the reference values. The positivity of sodium nitroprussid test was accepted as cystinuria. The results were compared between patients and control groups involving thirty children. The patients {{were divided into two}} subgroups according to the presence of renal scarring (RS) on radionuclide scan. The similar comparisons were made between the subgroups. Results: There {{was no significant difference between}} the ratios of hypercalciuria, hypocitraturia and cystinuria in patient and control groups (p> 0. 05). Uox/Ucr levels were significantly increased in patients compared to controls (p= 0. 001) whereas Uca/Ucr and Ucit/Ucr levels were similar among study groups (p= 0. 082 and p= 0. 466). There was no significant difference between RS (-) and RS () groups for hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia and cystinuria (p> 0. 05). Discussion: The increase in urinary excretion of oxalate might be a risk factor for UTI. There was no evidence regarding that urinary metabolic abnormalities such as hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia and cystinuria have affected the development of RS in the setting of UTI...|$|R

40|$|Není překvapivé tvrdit, že cílem jak atletického soutěžení, tak i sokratovské filosofie je dosáhnout ctnosti, lidské dokonalosti či areté. Podrobnější pohled však ukazuje, že jejich podobnost je ještě mnohem hlubší. V tomto příspěvku ukazuji, že atletické soutěžení a sokratovská filosofie, tak jak ji známe z Platónových raných dialogů, jsou ideálně podobné. Pro podporu této teze nabízím pět bodů srovnání. Především jak agōn, tak i elenchos jsou v zásadě aktivitami hledání poznání, jejichž cílem je nalézat pravdu a porozumění. Zadruhé se obě vyznačují otázkami, které se snaží nalézt pochopení morálních pojmů na osobní, obecné a ideální úrovni. Zatřetí vyžadují obě činnosti přijetí omylnosti a rizika selhání, což motivuje touhu <b>učit</b> se, cvičit se a dosahovat úspěchu. Začtvrté obě vyžadují aktivní sebeprověřování. Konečně obě zahrnují povinnost vyzývat ostatní. It is not {{surprising}} to claim that athletic competition and Socratic philosophy both aim at virtue, human excellence, or aretē. But a closer look reveals that their similarities run much deeper than that. In this paper I argue that athletic competition and Socratic philosophy, as demonstrated in Plato's early dialogues, are ideally akin. To support this thesis, I offer five points of comparison. First, both agōn and elenchos are fundamentally knowledge-seeking activities aimed at the acquisition of truth and understanding. Second, both are characterized by questions that seek understanding of moral concepts on personal, general, and ideal levels. Third, both activities require an admission of fallibility and risk of failure, which motivates the desire to learn, train, and succeed. Fourth, both require the active testing of oneself. And finally, both include an obligation to challenge others...|$|R

40|$|Fat {{malabsorption}} {{induced by}} gastrointestinal lipase inhibitor {{leads to an}} increase in urinary oxalate excretion. BackgroundUnabsorbed fat and bile acids may react with calcium in the intestinal lumen, limiting the amount of free calcium binding with oxalate and thereby raising intestinal oxalate absorption leading to hyperoxaluria. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine whether orlistat (Xenical®), a gastrointestinal lipase inhibitor, might increase urinary oxalate in an experimental rat model. MethodsThirty-nine male adult Wistar rats were fed a standard diet alone (controls) or supplemented with either 2 % sodium oxalate (NaOx) or 3. 2 mL of soy oil, or with both (NaOx + soy oil) for 4 weeks (diet period). Orlistat (16 mg/day) was added to the diet from the 5 th to the 8 th week (diet + orlistat period). Urinary oxalate (uOx), calcium (uCa), magnesium (uMg), and citrate (<b>uCit)</b> were determined and the ion-activity product of calcium oxalate [AP (CaOx) indexrat] was estimated. ResultsCompared to baseline uOx significantly increased after diet + orlistat in controls (0. 64 ± 0. 1 mg/ 24 hours vs. 0. 56 ± 0. 1 mg/ 24 hours), soy oil (0. 80 ± 0. 3 mg/ 24 hours vs. 0. 49 ± 0. 2 mg/ 24 hours), and NaOx (2. 48 ± 0. 8 mg/ 24 hours vs. 0. 57 ± 0. 2 mg/ 24 hours), but the most marked increase occurred in NaOx + soy oil (3. 87 ± 0. 7 mg/ 24 hours vs. 0. 47 ± 0. 1 mg/ 24 hours). All groups except controls presented a significant reduction in uCa and uMg. Orlistat induced a significant increase in AP (CaOx) indexrat compared, respectively, to baseline and to the diet period in NaOx (4. 52 ± 2. 34 mg/ 24 hours vs. 0. 94 ± 0. 86 and 1. 53 ± 0. 93 mg/ 24 hours) and NaOx + soy oil (6. 49 ± 4. 03 mg/ 24 hours vs. 0. 54 ± 0. 17 and 1. 76 ± 1. 32 mg/ 24 hours). ConclusionThese data suggest that the use of lipase inhibitors, especially under a diet rich in oxalate alone or associated with fat, leads to a significant and marked increase in urinary oxalate and a slight reduction in uCa and uMg that, taken together, resulted in an increase in AP (CaOx) indexrat, elevating the risk of stone formation...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Dysphagia is {{a common}} and {{potentially}} serious problem in patients with neurological conditions. In many countries, dysphagia screening is used, which contributes to better patient outcomes. In Greece, the implementation of dysphagia screening {{has not yet been}} described. The aim was to examine the effectiveness of an educational session delivered to Greek masters-level nursing students and their faculty on the correct use of an 8 -item nursing dysphagia screening instrument developed in the Czech Republic. Methods: Fifteen students and nursing faculty members of the Technological Educational Institute of Athens were enrolled in this descriptive pilot study. They were educated on dysphagia in a session consisting of a theoretical and practical part and a discussion. The participants were asked to indicate their clinical experience with dysphagia and their opinion on the importance of nurses’ involvement in dysphagia assessment. Their knowledge of the screening procedure and interpretation and documentation of the result was tested using a hypothetical patient case. Results: In this study, 4 (27 %) participants had prior experience with patients with dysphagia. All of them thought that nurses’ involvement in dysphagia assessment was very important. Slightly {{more than half of the}} participants identified, interpreted, and documented all of the 8 item results correctly. Conclusion: The participants were motivated to learn, however, complete mastery of the assessment technique was not achieved. The learning experience was affected by several issues that were unique to Greece, and the participants’ efforts focused on understanding how the new knowledge and skills could affect their daily practice. Direct ongoing support in the clinical setting could be beneficial. Cíl. Cílem bylo zjistit efektivitu edukační lekce pro studenty magisterského oboru ošetřovatelství a jejich akademické pracovníky na téma správného využití screeningového nástroje pro poruchy polykání, který byl vytvořen v České republice. Metodika: Patnáct studentů a akademických pracovníků instituce Technological Educational Institute v Aténách se zúčastnilo této pilotáže. Byli edukováni na téma dysfagie v lekci, která obsahovala teoretickou a praktickou část a diskuzi. Účastníci měli uvést jejich zkušenosti s dysfagií a jejich názor na důležitost zapojení sestry do posuzování dysfagie. Jejich znalost screeningové metody, interpretace a dokumentace výsledků byla testována na hypotetickém příkladu pacienta. Výsledky: Čtyři (27 %) účastníků měli předchozí zkušenost s pacienty s dysfagií. Všichni byli názoru, že zapojení sestry do posuzování dysfagie je důležité.
