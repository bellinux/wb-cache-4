40|$|Finned tube {{evaporators}} {{are used}} {{in a wide range}} of application such as commercial and industrial cold/freezed storage rooms with high traffic loading under frosting conditions. During the literature survey it has been realized that there is not enough experimental and visual data regarding the <b>unit</b> <b>cooler</b> tested with casing and fan integrated as in real operating conditions. As it is known, the usage of fan and evaporator external case and non-optimum distributor design may affect air and refrigerant side distribution, capacity and frost formation along the fins with respect to degree of maldistribution. In this paper, an evaporator with an integrated fan was manufactured and tested at under frosting conditions by only changing air flow rate at ambient balanced type test laboratory in contrast with testing at wind tunnel and more uniform flow distribution. During the test, operation performed according to three different air flow rate separately. The parameters concerning test operation such as the changes of air temperature, air relative humidity, surface temperature, air-side pressure drop and refrigerant side capacity etc. were followed in detail for each air flow rate. At the same time, the digital and thermal images were captured in front of heat exchanger; thus, the frost temperature distributions, blockage ratios and frost thicknesses occurring throughout all surfaces were investigated. In this study the effect of air flow rate on frosting has been investigated. The test and visual results showed that the trendline of air side pressure drop has increased slowly at the first stage of test operations, then this phenomena has increased linearly up to a top point and then the linearity has disrupted instantly and this point has admitted beginning of defrost operation for each case. On the other hand, the refrigerant capacities were declined continuously during the test operations. When examining visual and thermal images captured at certain time intervals, it was shown an uneven frost layers and detected the temperature distributions in front of evaporator as different degree for each case via thermal and digital camera. Similarly, the frost thicknesses distribution with time occurring at the specific area of each circuit was identified via macro lens and Matlab Image Process Program. Moreover, the initial period of frost growth, which have significant impact on further frost growth, was followed and the stages of frost growth has been determined. ...|$|E

40|$|Energy {{costs are}} {{increasing}} rapidly. Energy efficiency strategies {{are required to}} reduce electricity consumption for energy intensive operations. Cooling systems of deep level mines consume approximately 25 % of their total electricity consumption. Cold water supplied by these systems is reticulated throughout the mine. Water reticulation can account for a further 42 % of the total electricity consumption of a typical deep level mine. Underground working areas in deep level mines must be cooled to account for temperatures of up to 60 °C. Mobile <b>cooling</b> <b>units</b> are often used to cool underground working areas. These units require significant amounts of chilled water. Adequate supply of chilled water to these units is crucial to comply with health and safety regulations. It is often found that the water supply to mobile <b>cooling</b> <b>units</b> is not properly managed. Energy savings can be achieved on the cooling systems {{as well as the}} reticulation systems by reducing the water consumption of mobile <b>cooling</b> <b>units.</b> Various valves were identified as possible equipment to be used to manage water consumption on mobile <b>cooling</b> <b>units.</b> A case study proved that flow reductions on the mobile <b>cooling</b> <b>units</b> are possible. Worker safety and mine production was not affected by the installations. Electrical energy savings were achieved through reduced pumping and reduction in refrigeration energy consumption. Water consumption for one mobile <b>cooling</b> <b>unit</b> was reduced by 237 kℓ/day. This is equivalent to an average saving of 37. 5 kW per unit. This saving includes the reduced power consumption on the chillers and pumps. Installing the valve on 26 MCUs would potentially result in a total saving of approximately 1 MW, an annual saving of R 2. 8 million[URL]...|$|R
