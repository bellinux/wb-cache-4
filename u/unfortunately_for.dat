5|$|Andretti {{was also}} {{considered}} as a replacement, again for Tambay who had been injured in Canada, at the 1986 Detroit Grand Prix, this time for the Carl Haas owned Haas Lola team. Mario declined however, but recommended his son Michael Andretti for the drive. <b>Unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> Michael {{he was unable to}} obtain the FIA Superlicense required to allow him to race in Formula One. Instead the drive went to Eddie Cheever.|$|E
5|$|Baylor's passing offense {{had been}} strong all year. This {{was the first}} time they had been held below 21points in their last seven conference games and they had two wide {{receivers}} with over 50catches each. <b>Unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> the Bears, their starting quarterback Shawn Bell suffered a season-ending injury against Texas A on October 28.|$|E
5|$|Despite Nebraska's early-season loss, the Cornhuskers {{still had}} a chance to win a record-setting third {{consecutive}} national championship. A win against Texas would earn Nebraska a bid to the Sugar Bowl and a game against No. 1 Florida State to decide the national championship. <b>Unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> Nebraska, the underdog Longhorns upset heavily favored Nebraska, 3727. Eight days after losing to Texas, Nebraska was awarded a bid to the Orange Bowl.|$|E

5|$|However, on 7 October 2014, McKinlay was {{replaced}} as Watford head coach by ex-Chelsea defensive-midfielder Slaviša Jokanović. On 25 April 2015, Watford gained promotion to the Premier League after defeating Brighton 2–0 and other results going their way. <b>Unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> the Hornets, however, {{they failed to}} win their {{final game of the}} season against Sheffield Wednesday, thus gifting the Championship title to AFC Bournemouth in a dramatic season finale.|$|E
5|$|Once {{again the}} Byzantines' {{military}} power was depleted and Andronicus III {{was forced into}} diplomacy as his grandfather was before him; {{in return for the}} safety of the remaining Byzantine settlements in Asia Minor, tribute would be paid to the Ottomans. <b>Unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> the Byzantine Empire, this did not stop the Ottomans from laying siege to Nicomedia in 1333; the city finally fell in 1337.|$|E
5|$|The resort {{brought in}} some money, but Bowers {{was still in}} debt. The Bowers Mine was sold to pay off creditors, and she entered into {{negotiations}} with the newly created State of Nevada {{for the state to}} purchase the mansion as a psychiatric hospital. <b>Unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> Bowers, the deal fell through, and she was obliged to begin to sell her possessions to settle debts.|$|E

5|$|A single {{reference}} in {{the tomb of}} Ahmose Pen-Nekhebet indicates another campaign in Iamu {{in the land of}} Kehek. Unfortunately, the location of Kehek is unknown. It was long believed that Kehek was a reference to the Libyan tribe, Qeheq, and thus it was postulated that invaders from Libya took advantage of the death of Ahmose to move into the western Nile Delta. <b>Unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> this theory, the Qeheq people only appeared in later times, and Kehek's identity remains unknown. Nubia is a possibility, since Amenhotep did campaign there, and the western desert and the oases have also been suggested, since these seem to have fallen under Egyptian control once again.|$|E
5|$|After 1147, {{however, the}} {{relations}} between the two leaders became friendlier. By 1148 Manuel had seen the wisdom of securing an alliance with Conrad, whose sister-in-law Bertha of Sulzbach he had earlier married; he actually persuaded the German king to renew their alliance against Roger II of Sicily. <b>Unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> the Byzantine emperor, Conrad died in 1152, and despite repeated attempts, Manuel could not reach an agreement with his successor, Frederick I Barbarossa.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{successful}} collaboration on the pitch, {{a strong}} personal rivalry developed between Ramsey and Nicholson, partly because both {{liked the idea}} of staying on at Tottenham in a coaching role after retiring. Rowe made clear to Ramsey that he wanted him to do so, but <b>unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> him Rowe stepped down in February 1955, citing health issues. Another challenge to Ramsey's position at Tottenham {{came in the form of}} Danny Blanchflower, a Northern Ireland international wing-half signed from Aston Villa to replace Nicholson. Blanchflower was a more attacking player than Nicholson and thus did not provide the necessary cover for Ramsey to advance upfield; Ramsey also resented the idea that Blanchflower might supplant him as Tottenham's main strategist.|$|E

With England {{following}} on, Key made a maiden half-century to ensure Australia had to bat again. He eventually fell just after the new ball was taken, caught at second slip for 52.|$|E
5|$|General Alexandre de Beauharnais {{decided to}} put Tarrare's {{abilities}} to military use, and he was employed as a courier by the French army, with the intention that he would swallow documents, pass through enemy lines, and recover them from his stool once safely at his destination. <b>Unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> Tarrare, he could not speak German, and on his first mission was captured by Prussian forces, severely beaten and underwent a mock execution before being returned to French lines.|$|E
5|$|Having {{managed to}} quietly depose their father, the {{brothers}} {{now had to}} deal with Constantine VII. <b>Unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> them, rumours soon spread around Constantinople, to the effect that, following Romanos's deposition, Constantine VII's life was in danger. Before long, crowds gathered before the palace, demanding to see their emperor in person. The contemporary Lombard historian Liutprand of Cremona notes that the ambassadors and envoys from Amalfi, Gaeta, Rome, and Provence present in the capital also supported Constantine VII. Stephen and his brother had to succumb to the inevitable, recognizing their brother-in-law as the senior emperor.|$|E

5|$|He {{appears to}} have taken little {{interest}} in his official duties both as paymaster and inspector-general, leaving affairs {{in the hands of}} Edmund Waters. Waters had been his private secretary, and when Villiers came to office as paymaster, Waters was appointed chief clerk in that department, rising to deputy paymaster in 1797. Waters and Villiers invested in real estate with some of the money passing through the office; <b>unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> Villiers, Waters was also diverting some of the funds to his own interest in the Opera House, and the accounts of the office were in a shambles.|$|E
5|$|In 1052, Domnall's {{aforesaid}} grandfather {{conquered the}} Kingdom of Dublin from Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, King of Dublin and the Isles (died 1064/1065), {{and soon after}} appointed Murchad as King of Dublin. About a decade later, Murchad appears to have driven Echmarcach from Mann, after which he gained the kingship of the Isles. Diarmait's deep-rooted authority in Norse-Gaelic Dublin lasted for two decades, and was a remarkable achievement that no other Irish king had ever accomplished. <b>Unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> the Uí Chennselaig, two of Diarmait's sonsMurchad and Glún Iairnunexpectedly predeceased their father in 1070, and Diarmait himself fell in battle two years later.|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} and second games of the season, the Cardinals lived up to that expectation. At in-state rival Kentucky, Louisville earned a 31–24 victory to win the Governor's Cup. This was {{followed}} the next week by a 63–27 victory over non-conference opponent Oregon State. <b>Unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> the Cardinals, their first Big East conference game of the season—and of school history—did not go as well. At South Florida, the ninth-ranked Cardinals were outscored 45–14, {{the first time in}} 13 games Louisville's offense was held to less than 30 points.|$|E

5|$|It must {{be taken}} into account that Soviet T-26 was one the most modern tanks of the world when it arrived to Spain, and Soviet Army tank {{doctrine}} was really advanced. <b>Unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> the Spanish Government during these years Stalin decided to eliminate all those generals that supported modern tank warfare and sent to Spain the officers that he liked. This meant Soviet tanks potential was never exploited in Spain as it could.|$|E
5|$|Lampugnano, <b>unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> the Guelphs, was {{considered}} a martyr for the Republic. This was made worse {{by the fact that}} the Guelphs in leadership refused to run elections in April, until in June they were forced by the populace. Ghibelline families took the reins of Milan in this election, and the Guelphs were defeated. However, the reprisals against the Guelphs, including the imprisonment of Appiani and Ossona who had been blamed (probably unjustly) for the massacre, led the populace to violently depose the Ghibellines and reinstall the extremist Guelphs. Gonzaga, however, whose friend Galeotto Toscano was killed in the uprising, departed Milan for Crema, hoping to make peace with Sforza.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1678, Danby was impeached by the House of Commons on {{the charge}} of high treason. Although {{much of the nation}} had sought war with Catholic France, Charles had {{secretly}} negotiated with Louis XIV, trying to reach an agreement under which England would remain neutral in return for money. Danby had publicly professed that he was hostile to France, but had reservedly agreed to abide by Charles's wishes. <b>Unfortunately</b> <b>for</b> him, the House of Commons failed to view him as a reluctant participant in the scandal, instead believing that he was the author of the policy. To save Danby from the impeachment trial, Charles dissolved the Cavalier Parliament in January 1679.|$|E
