50|$|HPM.1 is Hardware Platform Management IPM Controller Firmware <b>Upgrade</b> Specification of PICMG. This {{specification}} describes firmware <b>upgrade</b> procedure into PICMG IPM Controllers (Not PICMG 3.0 Shelf Management Controller (ShMC)), as {{specified in}} thespecifications AdvancedTCA, AdvancedMC and MicroTCA specifications. An <b>Upgrade</b> Agent (Ex:ipmitool) <b>upgrades</b> firmware via any IPMI interfaces (IPMB-0 or IPMB-L, LAN, UART or any Shelf-Carrier Manager).The specification also describes format of <b>upgrade</b> image. The <b>upgrade</b> image can contain {{one or more}} than one component's firmware. The <b>upgrade</b> agent <b>upgrades</b> the component's firmware one by one. The IPM controller can {{have more than one}} component (U-Boot, Linux, rfs, FPGA, etc.). The firmware <b>upgrade</b> procedure contains three stages (Preparation Stage, <b>Upgrade</b> Stage, and Activation Stage). In preparation stage <b>Upgrade</b> Agent gets target capabilities and all component properties. Then it compares this information with <b>Upgrade</b> image. If there is a mismatch, <b>Upgrade</b> Agent abandons the firmware <b>upgrade.</b> Otherwise it moves into <b>Upgrade</b> stage. In <b>Upgrade</b> stage <b>upgrade</b> agent sends all components firmware one by one. After successfully receiving the firmware, IPM controller waits for activation. In Activation stage <b>Upgrade</b> Agent activates newly uploaded firmware. If self-test is supported by IPM controller, then it is invoked. If self-test fails, IPM controller automatically rolls back to previous firmware. If IPM controller does not support automatic roll back, operator or <b>Upgrade</b> Agent has to initiate the manual roll back.|$|R

40|$|Purpose Enterprise systems (ES) <b>upgrade</b> is {{a complex}} phenomenon, yet it is {{possible}} to reduce the complexity through understanding of the <b>upgrade</b> drivers. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the various <b>upgrade</b> drivers, in order to provide a detailed understanding of the factors driving <b>upgrade</b> decisions. Design/methodology/approach This research is grounded in a qualitative survey design. It utilises a web-based survey questionnaire and semi-structured interviews to collect data from 41 respondents representing 23 large organisations. The data were qualitatively analysed and coded to identify the various drivers and their influence on ES <b>upgrade</b> decisions. Findings The findings suggest that the <b>upgrade</b> decisions are dependent on establishing the need to <b>upgrade,</b> which is influenced by various drivers and stakeholders interests. In addition, the findings suggest that organisations would only opt to <b>upgrade</b> when benefits are aligned with the <b>upgrade</b> and when the decision makes business sense. Research limitations/implications In this paper, the authors propose that there is a relationship between the <b>upgrade</b> drivers and the <b>upgrade</b> strategy. However, qualitative studies can only formulate logical generalisations. Hence, future research could explore these associations through a quantitative study in order to provide probabilistic generalisation that offers either similar or conflicting arguments applicable to ES <b>upgrade</b> phenomenon. Originality/value This paper provides an alternative classification of <b>upgrade</b> drivers, and conceptualises an association between <b>upgrade</b> drivers and the <b>upgrade</b> strategy, which in turn facilitates minimising disruptions and <b>upgrade</b> risks...|$|R

5000|$|After {{powering}} up a player, they retain that <b>upgrade</b> throughout {{the duration of}} the game. However, if that player gets overworked during the game, they may [...] "blow up" [...] and lose their <b>upgrade.</b> When human players blow up, they return to their normal state before the <b>upgrade.</b> Conversely, when a robot <b>upgrade</b> blows up, it turns into a dead robot. A dead robot turns gray and loses all its attributes, giving it a zero in all four categories (hitting, fielding, pitching, and chance). It can still be used during the game, but it is essentially a worthless player. After blowing up, an <b>upgraded</b> player can always be re-upgraded {{as long as you have}} the money. When you <b>upgrade</b> a player to A, you can also spend the money to have them further <b>upgraded</b> to B or C, although you pay full price for the <b>upgrade</b> (you don't get a discount for having previously <b>upgraded).</b> You cannot <b>upgrade</b> a player with the same <b>upgrade</b> they already have until they lose their power.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Persistent object stores {{require a}} way to {{automatically}} <b>upgrade</b> persistent objects, to change their code and storage representation. Automatic <b>upgrades</b> are a challenge for such systems. <b>Upgrades</b> must be performed {{in a way that}} is efficient both in space and time, and that does not stop application access to the store. In addition, however, the approach must be modular: it must allow programmers to reason locally about the correctness of their <b>upgrades</b> similar to the way they would reason about regular code. This paper provides solutions to both problems. The paper first defines <b>upgrade</b> modularity conditions that any <b>upgrade</b> system must satisfy to support local reasoning about <b>upgrades.</b> The paper then describes a new approach for executing <b>upgrades</b> efficiently while satisfying the <b>upgrade</b> modularity conditions. The approach exploits object encapsulation properties in a novel way. The paper also describes a prototype implementation and shows that our <b>upgrade</b> system imposes only a small overhead on application performance...|$|R

5|$|If the player's {{character}} {{falls in}} battle, {{they are forced}} to restart from the beginning, with all their items and experience points gone; to avoid this, the player can store items in warehouses found in towns they travel through. Because of this, the player makes long-term progress by <b>upgrading</b> powerful items at village blacksmiths and storing them in warehouses, while <b>upgrading</b> their character is more of a temporary improvement. In the Nintendo DS version of the game, the player can avoid having to start over by getting rescued by another player: this is done by giving the other player a rescue quest, either through a password or the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. When a player embarks on a rescue mission, they start from level 1 and have to reach the fallen character without stopping at towns on their way. If they succeed, the rescued player can proceed from where they left off, and keep their items and experience points.|$|E
50|$|For {{all four}} {{categories}} of <b>upgrades,</b> {{there are three}} different levels of <b>upgrade</b> you can purchase, known as A, B, and C (C being {{the most powerful and}} expensive). Every category has different prices for their <b>upgrades,</b> and the <b>upgrades</b> offer a higher percentage of power increase. The most inexpensive <b>upgrade</b> is fielding A (12%) for $1,000, and the most expensive is robot C (80%) for $30,000. Keep in mind when using the robot <b>upgrade</b> that it powers up all attributes of a character an equal amount corresponding to the <b>upgrade</b> level. The power received from a non-robot <b>upgrade</b> for a human character adds on to the character's already existing powers. Therefore, if two players, one with a hitting power of two and the other nine, both receive a hitting C <b>upgrade,</b> the latter will still be considerably stronger.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} a {{conditional}} <b>upgrade</b> strategy that has recently become {{common in the}} travel industry. After a consumer makes a reservation for a product (e. g., a hotel room), she is asked whether {{she would like to}} <b>upgrade</b> to a higher-quality (more expensive) one at a discounted price. The <b>upgrade,</b> however, is not fulfilled immediately. The firm fulfills <b>upgrades</b> at check-in if higher-quality products are still available, and the <b>upgrade</b> fee is only charged to the consumer if she gets <b>upgraded.</b> Consumers decide which product type to book and whether to accept an <b>upgrade</b> offer based on the anticipated <b>upgrade</b> probability. We model the consumers' decisions using a Poisson-arrival game framework with incomplete information and prove the existence of Bayesian Nash equilibrium. To further study the firm's optimal <b>upgrade</b> pricing strategy,we also analyze a fluid model which is the asymptotic version of the stochastic model. Our numerical studies validate that our theoretical results derived from the fluid model carry through to the stochastic model. Our analysis identifies multiple benefits of conditional <b>upgrades.</b> First, the firm is able to capture more demand by offering conditional <b>upgrades,</b> Second, conditional <b>upgrades</b> enable the firm to improve its market segmentation by inducing more consumers to purchase higher-quality products. Third, conditional <b>upgrades</b> give the firm more flexibility in better matching fixed capacities to stochastic demands. For a firm that has the ability to optimize product prices, conditional <b>upgrades</b> can generate higher revenues than dynamic pricing...|$|R
