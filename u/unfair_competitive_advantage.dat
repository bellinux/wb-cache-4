25|$|A's success {{attracted}} the attention of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's anti-trust chief, Thurman W. Arnold, who was urged to investigate A by Congressman Patman. In late 1941, following Pearl Harbor, the military placed many large businesses off-limits to the anti-trust division because of defense priorities, leaving grocery stores as an option. The next year, A and its senior executives, including the Hartford brothers, were criminally charged for restraint of trade in Dallas federal court. However, in 1944, prosecutors withdrew the complaint realizing that the Dallas federal judge thought the case was weak. The same day, charges were filed in Danville, Illinois, and were assigned to Federal Judge Walter Lindley. The prosecution complained that A had an <b>unfair</b> <b>competitive</b> <b>advantage</b> because its vertical integration including manufacturing, warehousing, and retailing allowed it to charge lower prices. Prosecutors also complained that A refused to buy from food retailers that insisted on selling through brokers or refused to give A advertising allowances. The judges contended that if unchecked, A would become a monopoly. A countered that its grocery-store share was only about 15%, significantly less than the leaders in other industries. Judge Lindley agreed with the government, fining each defendant $10,000.|$|E

This was a preliminary ruling on a complaint by Boeing that Bombardier was selling the CS100 to Delta Air Lines at unduly low prices, due to subsidies from {{the governments of}} Canada and Quebec subsidies; this allegedly produced an <b>unfair</b> <b>competitive</b> <b>advantage.</b> Boeing's complaint stated that the CS100 was being sold at US$19.6 million each, below the US$33.2 million production cost. A final decision on the tariff {{will be made by}} the U.S. by spring 2018. Bombardier said it will be disputing the [...] "absurd" [...] ruling.

40|$|Government {{provision}} {{of a financial}} safety net for banks and other financial institutions has been {{a key element of}} the policy response to the current financial crisis. In the process, the design of many safety net elements, such as deposit insurance, has been redrawn in many jurisdictions. In particular, governments extended existing guarantees and introduced new ones. While these measures did not address the root causes of the lack of confidence, they were nevertheless helpful in avoiding a further accelerated loss of confidence, thus buying valuable time. But they are not costless. First, like any guarantee, deposit insurance coverage gives rise to moral hazard, especially if the coverage is unlimited. Clearly, {{in the midst of a}} crisis, one should not be overly concerned with moral hazard, as the immediate task is to restore confidence, and guarantees can be helpful in that respect. Nonetheless, to keep market discipline operational, it is important to specify when the extra deposit insurance will end, and this timeline needs to be credible. Second, the co-existence of different levels of protection could give rise to <b>unfair</b> <b>competitive</b> <b>advantages,</b> vis-à-vis other forms of savings or vis-à-vis othe...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to assess the impacts that a "competitive {{solicitation}} " model would have on small businesses, and by extension, on low-income households within a utility Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) context. This evaluation is undertaken because the interests of low-income households and small businesses are often interwoven. Because of the importance attached to ensuring that low-income households are equitably served by whatever type of IRP model is adopted by Arkansas regulators, therefore, it is important, also, to {{pay particular attention to}} the impacts of IRP implementation on small businesses. The context within which small business impacts are considered is Section 111 (b) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct), which amended PURPA by adding Section 111 (c) (3) requiring state utility commissions to consider, within an IRP framework, the impact that implementation of IRP would have on small businesses engaged in the design, sale, supply, installation or servicing of energy efficiency measures such that utility actions would not provide utilities with <b>unfair</b> <b>competitive</b> <b>advantages</b> over small businesses. This analysis is presented in four parts. Part 1 summarizes why it is important for low-income households to be fully and equitably treated by whatever IRP model is adopted. Part 2 sets forth the proposition that low-income households tend to be primarily served by small businesses and that, therefore, the protection of small business is necessary for the protection of low-income customers. Part 3 reviews a variety of factors specifically disfavoring small business within a competitive solicitation model. Finally, Part 4 reviews the track record which the public utility industry has developed to date with regard to addressing the competitiveness of small business. Overall, this analysis concludes that the adoption of a "competitive solicitation " IRP model would have adverse competitive impacts on small businesses, to the particular detriment of low-income households...|$|R
2500|$|According to an {{investigation}} of USIA business in 1946–1955, 20% of its products were traded and consumed within USIA, 38% sold to Eastern Europe, 42% sold to non-USIA Austrian customers, and only 1% to Western European customers. The United States suppressed USIA operations through a [...] "neutralization plan" [...] devised in 1947. An embargo imposed by the United States on exports behind the Iron Curtain prohibited other Austrian businesses from selling their products to USIA, unless it guaranteed that the finished products will stay in Austria. Dealing with USIA, when allowed by the West, was problematic because valid legal title could not be enforced. Vienna City Hall informally banned municipal purchases of USIA products. Marshall Plan money was deliberately deployed against USIA interests. Despite these problems USIA had a crucial and <b>unfair</b> <b>competitive</b> <b>advantage.</b> It was exempt of Austrian customs and foreign trade regulations. It routinely disregarded and evaded Austrian taxes and its trucking arm engaged in outright smuggling. USIA products easily moved across the Iron Curtain, and could be sold at a profit and below fair market prices inside Austria. USIA retail shops in Vienna traded below market and were frequented by many Americans of modest means.|$|E

40|$|Do {{countries}} with low labor standards obtain inherent advantages in markets for {{international trade and}} investment? This question {{is at the heart}} of protracted debates about whether the trade benefits accorded members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) should be conditional on adherence to international labor standards developed by the International Labor Organization (ILO). Contemporary discussions of the relationship between labor standards and trade policy reflect a conflict between two points of view. One camp sees the adoption of labor standards proposed by the ILO as an important mechanism for improving the condition of labor, particularly in developing countries, but at least implicitly acknowledges that such standards may raise production costs. This group therefore argues that countries that fail to adopt key labor standards acquire <b>unfair</b> international <b>competitive</b> <b>advantage</b> over countries that ratify the ILO standards and proposes WTO actions to curb purported advantages.

The New Day made their in-ring debut on the November 28 episode of SmackDown in a winning effort against Titus O'Neil, Heath Slater and Curtis Axel. At WrestleMania 31, Woods {{competed in the}} André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal where he was {{eliminated}} by eventual winner, the Big Show. On the April 6, 2015 episode of Raw, New Day started developing heel traits as they would start interfering with the others' matches {{to help each other}} gain <b>unfair</b> <b>competitive</b> <b>advantages.</b> Woods especially would trash-talk with their opponents and the crowd during matches. At Extreme Rules, Big E and Kingston defeated Tyson Kidd and Cesaro to win the WWE Tag Team Championship after a distraction from Woods. Woods was then given a share of the title and the trio defended the titles under the Freebird Rule. Kingston and Big E retained their titles in rematches on both SmackDown and at Payback, with Woods interfering in both matches. At Elimination Chamber, The New Day retained the title in the first ever tag team Elimination Chamber match, where all three members were allowed to compete. At Money in the Bank, Woods and Big E lost the titles to The Prime Time Players (Titus O'Neil and Darren Young). Big E and Kingston would also lose in their championship rematch at Battleground. New Day would win the titles for a second time after they defeated the Prime Time Players, Los Matadores, and the Lucha Dragons in a tag team fatal 4-way match at SummerSlam. The next night on Raw, after Big E and Kingston defeated the Lucha Dragons, they were attacked by the returning Dudley Boyz, which ended with Woods being put through a table with a 3D. On the September 14 episode of Raw, New Day defeated the Prime Time Players in a title match, setting up a defense against the Dudley Boyz at Night of Champions, which New Day lost by disqualification but retained the title. On the September 28 episode of Raw, Woods answered John Cena's United States Championship Open Challenge, where Cena retained by disqualification after Kingston and Big E attacked him. The Dudley Boyz appeared afterwards to save Cena; this led to an impromptu six-man tag team match between The New Day against Cena and The Dudley Boyz, where The New Day were victorious after Kingston pinned D-Von. At Madison Square Garden, The New Day lost another title match by disqualification but Woods was put through a table with a 3D again. At Hell In A Cell, The New Day retained the titles after Kingston pinned Bubba Ray. New Day would then defend the title at TLC in a Triple-Threat Ladder match against The Usos and The Lucha Dragons, retaining the title.|$|R
