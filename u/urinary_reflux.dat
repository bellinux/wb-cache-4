40|$|Abstract [...] A less {{invasive}} {{method for}} diagnosis of <b>urinary</b> <b>reflux</b> is being pursued using high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). Microbubbles produced in the urinary bladder, by transcutaneous application of HIFU, can be visualized with a diagnostic ultrasound system and the bubble movement can be tracked from the bladder, through the ureters, and to the kidney, if reflux occurs. Since urine is under-saturated in total gas and filtered by the kidney, {{it is necessary to}} increase the gas and/or particle content in the urine in order to produce contrast microbubbles at a minimal level of HIFU. In five canine experiments, sodium bicarbonate (0. 0128 M/kg) was infused IV at 3 ml/min for 2 hours with Lasix ®. On average for 3 of 5 canines, the infusions resulted in a 63 % increase in urine pCO 2 from the baseline (from saline infusion), with mean increase to 87 mmHg. This pCO 2 change decreased the threshold rarefactional pressure for imageable microbubble generation on average to 7. 6 MPa (10 s exposure at 1. 18 MHz, 25 cycles, 0. 5 % duty cycle) from 9 MPa (pvalue= 0. 004). The elevated pCO 2 after bicarbonate infusion increased generated echogenicity 16 - 21 dB higher than for pristine urine or saline infusion for the same peak rarefactional pressure applied (p-value= 0. 002), and the longevity of the contrast was up to 12. 1 seconds. Although these urine property modifications were done with IV administration, eventually urine manipulation should be possible with equivalent bicarbonate and Lasix ® doses given orally. Therefore, manipulation of the urine gas content by intake of bicarbonate should be a safe and effective method to assist HIFU in generating copious imageable and residual microbubbles that can potentially be used for less invasive diagnosing <b>urinary</b> <b>reflux.</b> I...|$|E
40|$|Background: Urinary tract {{infection}} (UTI) {{is considered}} {{as one of the}} common diseases in children andin some cases is associated with high morbidity and long term complications. Identification ofpredisposing factors timely is effective in reducing the incidence of UTI. Aim & Objectives: This study was designed to evaluate the predisposing factors in children withsymptomatic urinary tract infection according to gender. Methods: In a randomized prospective study, 130 children with symptomatic UTI that were admitted toemergency department or referred to nephrology clinic of Abuzar Hospital, Ahvaz, Iran between October 2008 and August 2010 were reviewed. The inclusion criteria were all children more than one month thathad clinical symptoms of UTI and positive urine culture. Complete blood cell, blood biochemical tests,urine analysis, and renal ultrasonogram were done in all patients. Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) wasperformed in all patients younger than 5 years with a UTI, any child with a febrile UTI, school-aged girlswho have had two or more UTIs, and any boy with a UTI. Predisposing factors as a case sheet were askedfrom parents by the physician. They were included back-to-front wiping, washing with soap, usingbathtub, constipation, infrequent voiding, <b>urinary</b> <b>reflux,</b> uncircumcision in boy, labia adhesion, tightunderwear, pinworm infestation, history of urinary stones, and history of sondage. The exclusion criterionwas included children that their case sheet had not been filled completely. The SPSS version 15. 0 software was used for data analysis and differences in predisposing factors between boy and girl wereanalyzed using the chi-square test. The significant differences between groups were determined at level< 0. 05. This study was approved by ethics committee of Ahvaz Joundishapur University of MedicalScience. Results: UTI was found in a significantly higher proportion of girls (106 girls vs. 24 boys, P < 0. 001). Themean age of patients was 23. 91 ± 27. 0 (range: 1 - 138) months. The predisposing factors for UTI in ourstudy were included: back-to-front wiping in 74 patients (56. 9 %), infrequent voiding in 55 (42. 3 %),washing with soap in 52 (40 %), using bathtub in 38 (29. 2 %), constipation in 31 (23. 8 %), <b>urinary</b> <b>reflux</b> in 24 (18. 5 %), history of sondage in 16 (12. 3 %), tight underwear in 8 (6. 2 %), pinworm infestation in 7 (5. 4 %), history of urinary stone in 4 (3. 1 %), labia adhesion in 8 (7. 5 %), and uncircumcision in boy in 6 (25 %). <b>Urinary</b> <b>reflux</b> in boys was significantly more than girls (41. 7 % vs. 13. 2 %; P= 0. 003), whereasother predisposing factors in the two groups did not differ.

In vivo and in vitro experiments were designed to elucidate the microbubble generation process using 1. 8 MHz acoustic bursts at 125 ms. In in vivo experiments on rabbits, the peak rarefactional pressure threshold for contrast generation, as visualized with a diagnostic {{ultrasound system}}, decreased with increasing pCO 2. For the in vitro aqueous studies the threshold decreased almost a factor of two for increasing particle concentration (0. 2 µm dia. polystyrene) from 108 to 1010 particles/cc. The thresholds were {{at least twice as}} high for more saturated fluids, and CO 2 samples had considerably lower thresholds than respective under-saturations in air.

40|$|Recurrent {{bacterial}} {{infection of the}} kidney was previously thought {{to be responsible for}} the renal scarring typical of chronic pyelonephritis until recent studies suggested that recurrent bacteriuria rarely produces chronic pyelonephritis in the absence of obstructive uropathy. In contrast, the association between vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and chronic pyelonephritis has been observed frequently in the absence of urinary infection. Although the mechanism by which VUR injures the kidney has not been defined, recent observations have suggested that some component of urine might serve as an antigenic determinant involved in the immunopathogenesis of renal scarring in VUR. Therefore, the present studies investigated the immunopathogenic role of Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) in (1) a rabbit model of tubulointerstitial nephritis; (2) a swine model of reflux nephropathy; and (3) patients with recurrent nephrolithiasis. The antigenic similarities between THP and uropathic bacteria were also studied.

40|$|There is {{substantial}} evidence implicating environmental {{factors in the}} progression of prostate cancer. The metabolic consequences of a western lifestyle, such as obesity, insulin resistance and abnormal hormone production {{have been linked to}} prostate carcinogenesis through multiple overlapping pathways. Insulin resistance results in raised levels of the mitogens insulin and insulin-like growth factor- 1, both of which may affect prostate cancer directly, or through their effect on other metabolic regulators. Obesity is associated with abnormal levels of adipocyte-derived peptides (adipokines), sex hormones and inflammatory cytokines. Adipokines have been shown to influence prostate cancer in both cell culture studies and observational, population level studies. Testosterone appears to have a complex relationship with prostate carcinogenesis, and {{it has been suggested that}} the lower levels associated with obesity may select for more aggressive androgen independent prostate cancer cells. Prostatic inflammation, caused by infection, <b>urinary</b> <b>reflux</b> or dietary toxins, frequently occurs prior to cancer development and may influence progression to advanced disease.

40|$|Introduction. Complications {{following}} renal transplantation include ureteral obstruction, urinary leak and fistula, urinary retention, urolithiasis, and vesicoureteral reflux. These complications {{have traditionally}} been managed with open surgical correction, but minimally invasive techniques are being utilized frequently. Materials and Methods. A literature review {{was performed on the}} use of endourologic techniques for the management of urologic transplant complications. Results. Ureterovesical anastomotic stricture is the most common long-term urologic complication following renal transplantation. Direct vision endoureterotomy is successful in up to 79 % of cases. Urinary leak is the most frequent renal transplant complication early in the postoperative period. Up to 62 % of patients have been successfully treated with maximal decompression (nephrostomy tube, ureteral stent, and Foley catheter). Excellent outcomes have been reported following transurethral resection of the prostate shortly after transplantation for patients with <b>urinary</b> retention.

The clinical results indicated that after about two years of 12 healing sessions in a brief bioenergy economy package of biofield scanning, biofield attunement, and hand-on self-healing, the patient’s clinical signs remarkably improved {{to the extent that he}} returned to normal activities of his age and followed an athletic lifestyle. Conclusion: From a biosemiotic viewpoint, it can be discussed that bioenergy economy, by focusing on enhancing the pathways of salutogenesis was effective to evoke healing response in the patient’s body. The effect of the bioenergy economy practice may be due to the healing images and intentions flowed through patient’s body and healer-healee biofields’ coupling and interactions...|$|E
40|$|Urine was {{observed}} to flow intermittently in the collecting ducts of the extrarenal papilla of antidiuretic rats. The {{purpose of this}} investigation was to test Reinking and Schmidt-Nielsen's hypothesis that intermittent flow {{plays an important role in}} the production of maximally concentrated urine. Samples of collecting duct fluid were obtained from the base and tip of the papilla by micropuncture through the intact ureter. Fluid osmolality rose sharply from base, 894 ± 120 mosmol/kg H 2 O− 1 (mean±SE), to tip, 1, 667 ± 114 (P< 0. 001), a distance of only 2 mm, and was due exclusively to reabsorption of water. After excision of the ureter, which abolished intermittent flow, osmolality fell modestly at the base to 723 ± 82 mosmol/kg H 2 O− 1 (P < 0. 02), but strikingly at the tip to 1, 012 ± 103 (P < 0. 001). The pelvic ureter was paralyzed by topical verapamil and dimethylsulfoxide, which abolished intermittent flow. Osmolality of urine at the tip was not changed (1, 959 ± 184 mosmol/kg H 2 O− 1 before, vs. 1, 957 ± 126 after paralysis). The ureter was severed just beyond the papillary tip, a maneuver which preserved intermittent flow but abolished <b>urinary</b> <b>reflux</b> over the papilla. Urinary osmolality fell from 1, 876 ± 134 mosmol/kg H 2 O− 1 to 1, 284 ± 115 (P < 0. 005). These findings demonstrate that when the ureter is intact, over half of the increase in urinary osmolality above isotonicity occurs in the terminal one-fourth of the medullary collecting duct and is due exclusively to water reabsorption (no net solute addition). It is the continuity of the ureter, rather than intermittent flow due to ureteral peristalsis, which is essential for the formation of a maximally concentrated urine...|$|E
40|$|Small {{supernumerary}} marker chromosomes (sSMCs) {{derived from}} the near-centromeric area of chromosome 2 are very rare. In addition, duplications of the 2 p 11. 2 [...] >q 11. 2 region have displayed considerable variability between patients harboring and lacking clinical findings. Moreover, constitutional duplication of the 19 q 12 [...] >q 13. 2 region has previously only been described in two cases and was associated with delay of developmental milestones, corpus callosum anomalies, and obesity. Herein, we present a genotype-phenotype correlation in a patient harboring two sSMCs derived from chromosomes 2 and 14 or 22, respectively. The DNA was studied using G-banding, {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} techniques, and array-based comparative genomic hybridization. A 48,XX,+der(2) del(2) (p 11) del(2) (q 11. 2),+der(14) t(14; 19) (q 11;q 12) del(19) (q 13. 31) or 48,XX,+der(2) del(2) (p 11) del(2) (q 11. 2),+der(22) t(22; 19) (q 11;q 12) del(19) (q 13. 31) was detected in the patient. The sSMC 14; 19 or 22; 19, with its centromere originating from either chromosome 14 or 22, encompassed a 13. 56 megabase (Mb) 19 q derived region, harboring 263 genes, and the sSMC 2 a 2. 71 Mb region including 29 genes. The patient had symptoms including a ventral septal defect, bilateral grade IV <b>urinary</b> <b>reflux,</b> corpus callosum agenesis, microphthalmia, and obesity. The 19 q segment contained the genes AKT 2, CEACAM 1, CEBPA, LIPE, and TGFB 1 which are involved in adipose tissue homeostasis and insulin resistance, and could potentially contribute to the obese phenotype observed. Array-based genetic characterization and long-term clinical evaluation with attention toward weight gain in patients with chromosome 19 q duplications might in the future lead to the description of a obesity-associated genetic syndrome, something that could have implications in management and treatment of patients carrying a dup(19) (q 12 q 13. 2). Whether the der(2) (p 11 q 11. 2) contributes to the phenotype remains inconclusive...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Vesicoureteral <b>reflux,</b> <b>urinary</b> {{infection}} and pyelonephritic scarring represent a well known triad in pediatric practice {{that may lead}} to severe scarring of kidneys, and development of so called reflux nephropathy. Apart from standard therapeutic options (conservative treatment and surgical therapy), endoscopic correction of refluxing vesicoureteral junction has been introduced into clinical practice. Material and methods This study included endoscopically treated patients with primary vesicoureteral reflux over a 9 -year period, as well as certain clinical parameters. Results Endoscopic correction of primary vesicoureteral reflux with teflon paste has been successful in up to 93. 5 % of patients. After one application vesicoureteral reflux disappeared in 58. 8 % of cases. After two applications 86. 0 % of ureters were cured, whereas the third application had no further effect on existing reflux. Improvement with spontaneous regression of reflux was established in 7. 5 % of treated ureters. Discussion Endoscopic correction should be performed in all patients with third grade vesicoureteral reflux, and in selected patients with second and fourth grade reflux. First grade reflux should be treated conservatively, and fifth grade reflux should be treated surgically. Conclusion Endoscopic treatment of primary vesicoureteral reflux is an easy, simple, fast and safe procedure that prevents regurgitation of urine from bladder to upper parts of the urinary system in most of cases...|$|R
40|$|Background: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) affects {{approximately}} 1 % of children. It is a {{risk factor}} for acute pyelonephritis. Reflux has been identified in 30 - 50 % of children following <b>urinary</b> tract infection. <b>Reflux</b> nephropathy is one of the causes of hypertension and end stage renal disease in children. The primary diagnostic procedure for evaluation of VUR in children is fluoroscopic voiding cystography (VCUG) and radionuclide cystography (RNC). Many investigators have used voiding urosonography (VUS) for the diagnosis of reflux in an effort to eliminate the radiation exposure especially during follow-up period. Methods: We analyzed 25 children with suspected VUR who underwent RNC and VUS concurrently in Labbafi Nejad Hospital in Tehran. Reflux was diagnosed in 8 patients by RNC and in 9 patients by VUS. One case with reflux in RNC was not detected by VUS, and 2 cases with reflux in VUS were not detected by RNC. Findings: The diagnosis of reflux by these two procedures (RNC and VUS) was comparable (p= 0. 000, r= 0. 728). In addition, grades of reflux reported by these procedures were also comparable (p= 0. 000, r= 0. 724). We considered RNC as the method of choice for reflux diagnosis. The specifity of VUS was 88 % and its sensitivity 87 %. Accuracy of this imaging was 88 % (PPV= 77 %, NPV= 94 %). Conclusions: These results showed that VUS is a valuable procedure in follow-up and screening of patients with vesicoureteral reflux...|$|R
40|$|Aim: A solitary {{functioning}} renal unit in high anorectal malformation may harbor anomalies in the upper/lower {{urinary tract}} that further compromise renal function and accelerate hyperfiltration injury. We aimed {{to analyze the}} clinical course, management, and outcome of children with a solitary renal unit and high anorectal malformation. Materials and Methods: A cohort of solitary renal units in anorectal malformation managed between 2000 and 2015 with a defined protocol at a pediatric nephro-urology clinic {{are included in the}} study. Investigations and management were individualized according to issues in the agenetic/dysplastic unit, solitary functioning unit, or bladder-urethra. Clinical details, management, and outcome were analyzed. Results: Of 53 cases of high anorectal malformation with urologic anomalies, 17 (32 %) had single kidneys. Majority (10 / 17, 59 %) had another complicating urinary tract anomaly, four being uremic at presentation. Nearly half had multiple urinary infections including epididymo-orchitis unrelated to the rectourinary fistula and warranted additional stoma (bowel/urinary) or other urinary tract surgery. At a mean follow-up of 70 months, majority (14 / 17, 82 %) have a preserved solitary renoureteric unit while the remaining three await renal replacement therapy. Conclusion: Solitary functioning renal units associated with high anorectal malformation in children need meticulous investigation and surveillance to facilitate renal preservation. The implications of the associated rectourinary fistula, vesicoureteral <b>reflux,</b> <b>urinary</b> infections including epididymo-orchitis, and other urinary tract anomalies on the conventional surgical management are illustrated...|$|R
