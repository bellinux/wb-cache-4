5|$|De Soto {{continued}} her patrols in the Gulf of Mexico into {{the month of}} August, braving the sweltering heat to board and inspect coastal and seaborne traffic. The steamer Alice Vivian was seized on 16 August, as she had no papers, and the steamer Nita was taken the next day for the same reason. During this month, {{wear and tear on}} the steamer's boilers began to show and, despite attempts at repair, De Soto steadily lost speed. On 12 September, following a nine-hour chase under steam and sail, the Union ship finally took the blockade runner Montgomery, a chase Capt. Walker claimed should have taken one fourth the time if the boilers were in good order. Tinkering helped build <b>up</b> <b>steam</b> pressure to a point, and De Soto managed to chase down the screw steamer Leviathan on 22 September.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 6 December, the German ships departed Picton Island, bound for the Falklands. On 7 December, they rounded Tierra del Fuego and turned north into the Atlantic. They arrived off the Falklands at around 02:00; three hours later, von Spee detached Gneisenau and Nürnberg to land a party ashore. By 08:30, the ships were approaching Port Stanley, when they noticed thick columns of smoke rising from the harbor. After closing to the harbor entrance, they quickly realized they were confronted by a much more powerful squadron, which was just getting <b>up</b> <b>steam.</b> Von Spee immediately broke off the operation and turned east to flee before the British ships could catch his squadron. By 10:45, Gneisenau and Nürnberg had rejoined the fleet, and the German auxiliaries were detached to seek shelter in the maze of islands off Cape Horn.|$|E

25|$|UP 4014 is a 4-8-8-4 Articulated type, Big Boy, freight steam locomotive. On July 23, 2013, it was {{announced}} that the UP was acquiring UP 4014 from The Southern California Chapter of The Railway and Locomotive Historical Society in Pomona, with the goal of restoring it to service. 4014 was moved from Pomona to the Union Pacific West Colton yard on January 26, 2014 and then to Cheyenne, Wyoming. Restoration to full operating condition is currently in progress, expected to be finished between 2017 and 2019. Volunteers and paid contractors are assisting the <b>UP</b> <b>steam</b> crew in the rebuild predominantly at the <b>UP</b> <b>Steam</b> Shop in Cheyenne.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time Santo and Hogan {{recruited}} transit workers into the Communist Party, which organized along similar lines. The party began taking a far less visible role, however, as the organizing drive picked <b>up</b> <b>steam</b> and as the party entered the Popular Front era. The Communist Party stopped publishing its shop papers after some workers complained that they were hurting the union's organizing drive. While Communisty Party members still provided much of the leadership for the union, they refrained from identifying themselves as such.|$|E

25|$|The union, {{like most}} other United States {{construction}} unions, had remained nearly all-white {{for most of its}} history. That began to change in the early 1960s, as the American civil rights movement began to challenge employment discrimination in the north, then picked <b>up</b> <b>steam</b> in the 1970s as the federal government began using the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to knock down some of the barriers to African-American workers' entry into the industry. Some local unions of the Iron Workers fought integration and affirmative action tenaciously, but usually unsuccessfully.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, younger Hong Kong workers began {{avoiding}} the manufacturing industry entirely. Hong Kong's on-going evolution away from manufacturing picked <b>up</b> <b>steam</b> during the decade, as production's {{share of the}} economy fell from 22.8% in 1980 to 16.7% ten years later. Replacing it was a greater reliance on services, which rose from 68.3% to 75.4% of GDP. The fastest growing sectors were foreign trade, logistics and communications and general personal and community services. The lack of investment in domestic industry, along with China's economic reform, began opening up manufacturing to the mainland. Middle-aged {{men and women who}} had spent decades in manufacturing were suddenly left with no place to go.|$|E

The team was part of Dodge's return into NASCAR, with Dodge Dealers sponsoring the entire season. The year was off to a sluggish start when Atwood failed to qualify at the spring Atlanta race, but picked <b>up</b> <b>steam</b> {{towards the end of the}} year, winning the pole at Phoenix International Raceway, and almost winning the Homestead race before relinquishing the lead to teammate Elliott late in the race. Atwood barely missed wrestling the rookie of the year crown away from Kevin Harvick, despite Harvick finishing much higher in the points (ninth) and winning twice.|$|E

25|$|By late {{afternoon}} Drake had {{slowed to a}} crawl due to her inability to keep <b>up</b> <b>steam.</b> Northern Wave still hovering nearby. The situation appeared hopeless until the steel freighter, Crescent City, came upon the struggling Drake. Crescent City was nearly {{twice the size of}} Drake and she used her massive hull to provide an artificial lee from the gale force wind. Michigans cook, Harry Brown, leaped toward Crescent City before the two vessels were close enough and was swallowed by Lake Superior. The rest of the crew waited until the hulls of the two ships were grinding together and all of them safely jumped to Crescent City by 17:00. Crescent City reached the Soo Locks with Michigan and Drake crews at 2:00 on 3 October 1901.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 2009–10 season, Bayern {{made major}} changes {{to both the}} squad and the management, hiring Dutch coach Louis van Gaal and strikers Arjen Robben and Mario Gómez, with the latter {{purchase}} setting a new club record transfer fee at €30 million. Shortly {{before the end of}} the year, long-term manager Uli Hoeneß retired from his position and assumed the club's presidency. After a rocky start into the new season, the team began to pick <b>up</b> <b>steam</b> in late fall, defeating Juventus 4–1 in a make-or-break Champions League group stage match and steadily ascending in the Bundesliga. Led by a brilliant Robben, who scored a string of crucial goals in all competitions, Bayern was eventually able to secure both domestic titles and advanced to the Champions League final in Madrid. While they were ultimately unable to overcome Internazionale, finishing as runners-up still meant that the 2009–10 season was Bayern's most successful in almost a decade.|$|E
25|$|USS Saginaw 's {{crew was}} just putting the anchor {{down when the}} first shot burst in the water next to the ship. Surprised, the Americans first raised a white flag to show their {{friendly}} intentions but then a second shot was fired along with a third. Trying to get <b>up</b> <b>steam,</b> the Saginaw turned around and withdrew slowly to 900 yards, by which time her crew were at station and ready for action. The American gunners returned fire with one of their 32-pounders and after only about twenty minutes the Vietnamese guns were silenced. A secondary explosion was observed and it was suspected that either the powder magazine of the fort, {{or one of the}} guns, blew up and killed their operators. After the explosion no further shots were fired from the fort. However, the Saginaw 's gunners continued their bombardment for another half-hour unopposed until the fort was in ruins. American forces suffered no damage or casualties and after the action, communicating with the natives proved fruitless so the Saginaw steamed back to Hong Kong.|$|E

25|$|LSU scored first {{early in}} the first quarter on a two-yard run by Brodnax, which was {{followed}} by a Kentucky touchdown late in the same quarter. Dietzel sent in the Chinese Bandits to start the second quarter. The Bandits wore down the Wildcats offense and did not allow a score {{for the rest of the}} half. On offense, Billy Hendrix scored on a 19-yard pass from Rabb to give LSU a 13–0 halftime lead. LSU came out in the second half determined to put the game away. Cannon ran for a 19-yard touchdown and kicked the extra point to start the third quarter, followed by a five-yard touchdown pass from Matherne to Norwood. The only score in the fourth quarter was Cannon's second touchdown on a two-yard run up the middle. LSU dominated the game statistically. The Tigers converted 18 first downs and had 364 offensive yards, compared to the Wildcats' eight and 136. Kentucky was focused on stopping the LSU passing game, which had picked <b>up</b> <b>steam</b> over the last few games. Because of this, led by Cannon, the Tigers had a big night in the running game. The team gained 243 yards on the ground, with Cannon rushing for 108 of those on twelve carries. The win moved LSU up to third in the Coaches' Poll and Associated Press Poll.|$|E
