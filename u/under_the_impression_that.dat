5|$|The {{statements}} {{cited by}} Universal {{recognize that the}} Donkey Kong theme loosely evokes the King Kong films. However, none of the statements remotely suggests that the authors were <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> Donkey Kong was connected with the company holding the King Kong trademark.|$|E
5|$|Dalmazzo urged Roatta {{to expand}} Italian links with Serb {{nationalist}} groups into {{an alliance with}} them. At this time, the Italians were looking for allies to restore order, fight the Partisans, and support their political claims to NDH territory, and were <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> the various Serb nationalist groups were far better organised than they actually were. For example, Roatta was <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> Jevđević represented the Herzegovinian Chetniks, {{and that they were}} aligned with Dangić. In early March, Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin suddenly told the Italians that they were effectively in control of a Chetnik movement, and were ready to collaborate with the Italians on the latter's terms. Jevđević sent a message to Dalmazzo explaining that the Herzegovinian Chetniks wanted to avenge Todorović and were concentrating around Nevesinje ready to demonstrate their loyalty to the Italians. Despite their statements, Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin faced significant difficulties; the Serb nationalist groups had yet to demonstrate their military value to the Italians, and not all of the armed groups even acknowledged their leadership.|$|E
5|$|Sometime {{during their}} journey or their {{stay in the}} region, Rebmann and Krapf learned of a great {{mountain}} referred to as 'Kilimansharo', which reached the clouds and which was 'capped in silver'. The two men, like most Europeans at the time, were <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> snow and ice could not exist {{so close to the}} equator, and failed to realize the significance of the mountain being 'topped with silver'.|$|E
50|$|The Chocolate Factory (Mil Rí) {{is under}} {{pressure}} {{and unable to}} sell their products.

5000|$|The {{species name}} [...] "capensis", meaning [...] "of the cape", is {{actually}} a misnomer, as Nicolaas Meerburgh was <b>under</b> <b>the</b> mistaken <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> it was native to the Cape of Good Hope, in southern Africa.|$|R
5|$|The diversionary attacks went well, with Soviet forces acting <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> the Poles had targets {{other than}} Vilnius. Despite their diversionary intent, these attacks succeeded {{in their own}} right, with Generał Józef Adam Lasocki taking Lida in two days despite {{unexpectedly}} strong resistance, and Generał Stefan Mokrzecki taking Nowogrodek in three days and Baranowicze in four.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton's faction {{were against}} any {{conditional}} ratification, <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> New York {{would not be}} accepted into the Union, while Clinton's faction wanted to amend the Constitution, while maintaining the state's right to secede if their attempts failed. During the state convention, New Hampshire and Virginia becoming the ninth and tenth states to ratify the Constitution, respectively, had ensured any adjournment would not happen and a compromise {{would have to be}} reached. Hamilton's arguments used for the ratifications were largely iterations of work from The Federalist Papers, and Smith eventually went for ratification, though it was more out of necessity than Hamilton's rhetoric. The vote in the state constitution was ratified 30 to 27, on July 26, 1788.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} a network of foreign businessmen in Japan who could be turned into an intelligence network in time of war, it was suggested by his commander, Colonel Burnett, that Mashbir resign his commission and become a businessman in Tokyo himself, {{in order to put}} the M-Plan in effect. Consequently, Mashbir resigned in 1923 to pursue business interests and undercover secret intelligence operations, <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> he could be reinstated in the Army when his work was done. However the Great Kantō earthquake of September 1923 bankrupted him and, when he sought reinstatement in the military, discovered that it was not possible, because the reinstatement clause of the law under which he had resigned was no longer valid. Neither Mashbir nor Colonel Burnett, who had urged Mashbir to resign, was aware of this, and it become a sticking point for Mashbir in later life, noting that even in 1926 the law was still being reprinted without the correct clause. Consequently, the M-Plan to establish an intelligence network in Japan was scrapped. Mashbir returned to the United States in 1926 <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> his military career was over, and sought employment selling refrigerators. He managed to rejoin the Military Intelligence Division G-2 Reserves, but only spent one year in active duty beginning in the summer of 1927 during which time he updated the Order of Battle documentation on Japan. For the next ten years he returned to his original profession of engineering, including some government work on technical standards.|$|E
50|$|The county {{takes its}} name from the Trinity River, named in 1845 by Major Pierson B. Reading, who was <b>under</b> <b>the</b> mistaken <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> river emptied into Trinidad Bay. Trinity is the English {{translation}} of Trinidad.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{version of}} the {{character}} appeared in the Duck Dodgers episode [...] "The Green Loontern" [...] voiced by Tara Strong.

5|$|The Italians were <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> {{they were}} facing three Belgian {{divisions}} with South African reinforcements. They also only had about two months' provisions left. Gazzera radioed the Allies in Addis Abeba his intentions {{to negotiate a}} surrender with the Belgians. The Belgians were preparing for another assault when at 13:40 two staff cars bearing white flags drove down the mountain. In them were eight Italian generals, a catholic priest and Gazzera's chief of staff. Gilliaert met with them {{a short distance away}} from Bortai Brook near Gambela. They requested that all hostilities south of the Blue Nile cease and that their army be granted the honours of war. Gilliaert accepted and on 6 July he drove into Saïo to receive the formal surrender of the Italian forces.|$|E
5|$|The company's men, {{a mixture}} of former French paratroopers, ex-Foreign Legionnaires and young adventurers, had trouble from the start {{integrating}} with the Rhodesian forces, and became unsettled by the respective ranks they were given in the Rhodesian Army. In an attempt to raise their morale and create a strong esprit de corps, the Army issued them beret insignias backed with the French tricolour and allowed them to raise the flag of France alongside that of Rhodesia each morning. Apparently <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> they had signed up as highly paid mercenaries, many of the French troopers returned home after their first bush trip, unhappy to have received no more money than a regular Rhodesian soldier.|$|E
5|$|By 11 a.m., it {{was clear}} that a {{breakthrough}} was not forthcoming and the advances by Sherman and McPherson were failures. Just then, Grant received a message from McClernand, which stated that he was heavily engaged, the Confederates were being reinforced, and he requested a diversion on his right from McPherson's corps. Grant initially refused the request, telling McClernand to use his own reserve forces for assistance; Grant was mistakenly <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> McClernand had been lightly engaged and McPherson heavily, although the reverse was true. McClernand followed up with a message that was partially misleading, implying that he had captured two forts"The Stars and Stripes are flying over them."—and that another push along the line would achieve victory for the Union Army. Although Grant once again demurred, he showed the dispatch to Sherman, who ordered his own corps to advance again. Grant, reconsidering, then ordered McPherson to send Quinby's division to aid McClernand.|$|E
50|$|There was {{confusion}} {{between the}} ground convoy and the assault team. The assault {{team and the}} ground convoy waited for 20 minutes to receive their orders to move out. Both units were <b>under</b> <b>the</b> mistaken <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> {{they were to be}} first contacted by the other.|$|R
5000|$|... b) For {{want of a}} {{sufficiently}} precise phraseology, the correction was mis-understood by <b>the</b> pilot who, <b>under</b> <b>the</b> mistaken <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> he had passed the ridge leading to the summit and was still at a flight level which afforded sufficient safety clearance {{over the top of}} Mont Blanc, continued his descent.|$|R
60|$|In {{the midst}} {{of one of these}} bursts of hilarity Mr Hazlit entered the room. The sound seemed to grate on his feelings, for he frowned as he walked, in an absent mood, up to a glass case full of gaudy birds, and turned his back to it <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression,</b> apparently, <b>that</b> it was a fire.|$|R
5|$|Dexter captures Jaworski, {{who admits}} his guilt and {{explains}} {{that he has no}} remorse for his act. After killing Jaworski, Dexter drives to see Rita, but is sidetracked when he sees a refrigerated truck. Dexter follows the truck, and the driver throws a severed head at Dexter's car. When the police squad arrives, LaGuerta confirms that Doakes' case was indeed a crime of passion. Dexter arrives at Rita's apartment, where she expresses interest in taking their relationship to a more intimate level, <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> this is what Dexter wants. Dexter feels uncomfortable and is saved when Rita's son, Cody, gets sick next door and needs his mother to pick him up. When Dexter arrives home, he finds a doll's head on his refrigerator door. Inside the freezer, he finds the other parts of the doll, severed just like the bloodless bodies of the dead women. Dexter views the doll as an invitation to play, which he accepts gladly.|$|E
5|$|Nomura {{redesigned}} Cloud for {{his appearance}} in Kingdom Hearts. He is depicted with a claw and a crimson cape, and {{the blade of}} his sword is wrapped in bandages. Stating that Cloud's left arm was inspired by Vincent Valentine, Nomura explained {{that he wanted to}} give the character a more demon-like appearance due to his ties to the dark side in the game. Nomura stated that he wanted to leave the question of whether Cloud was searching for Aerith open to the player's interpretation. Teruaki Sugawara, the game's voice director, recommended Takahiro Sakurai, Cloud's Japanese voice actor, to Nomura for the role. Nomura had originally asked Sakurai to play the protagonist of The Bouncer, Sion Barzahd, but found that his voice best suited Cloud after hearing him speak. Sakurai received the script without any accompanying visuals, and first arrived for recording <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> he would be voicing a different character than the one featured in Final Fantasy VII.|$|E
5|$|On , the Mongol leader Hulagu sent through John the Hungarian a new {{letter to}} King Louis IX of France, again {{offering}} an alliance. The letter explained that previously, the Mongols had been <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> the pope {{was the leader}} of the Christians, but now they realized that the true power rested with the French monarchy. The letter mentioned Hulagu's intention to capture Jerusalem {{for the benefit of the}} pope, and asked for Louis to send a fleet against Egypt. Hulagu promised the restoration of Jerusalem to the Christians, but also still insisted on Mongol sovereignty, in the Mongols' quest for conquering the world. It is unclear whether or not King Louis actually received the letter, but at some point it was transmitted to Pope Urban, who answered in a similar way as his predecessors. In his papal bull Exultavit cor nostrum, Urban congratulated Hulagu on his expression of goodwill towards the Christian faith, and encouraged him to convert to Christianity.|$|E

5|$|There {{are five}} main plot lines that the player {{will have the}} chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. Throughout gameplay, the player is given {{multiple}} options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. After Mai's scenario is completed, a replay of her route will offer an additional choice to play through Sayuri's back-story. Jun Maeda, who worked on the scenario for Kanon, commented in March 2001 that the Japanese public may have fallen <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> Key makes soothing games because of Kanons influence, but Maeda affirmed that there was not one person who worked on Kanon who thought that.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterwards, at 19:30, B Company {{detected}} a North Korean force of around company-size {{preparing for a}} frontal assault, and called-in mortar fire to break up their formations, while a number of forward patrols had to be withdrawn by the Australians {{in order to prevent}} their encirclement. In response the North Koreans fired mortars at the Australian positions with limited effect. Half an hour later North Korean shells hit the 3 RAR battalion headquarters and C Company positions {{on the other side of}} the river, however the rounds landed in the damp soil of the paddy field and failed to explode. Periodically they were also targeted by machine-gun fire, but it was mostly high and posed little threat. Perhaps also <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> the Australians had withdrawn, the North Koreans failed to press their attack. Yet they soon realised their mistake and heavy small arms fire began again at 22:30 with North Korean activity against A and B Companies increasing significantly, which resulted in B Company suffering two killed and three wounded. The Australian right flank was now exposed and following a request from Thirlwell, Chitts detached 1 Platoon under Lieutenant John Wathen to bolster B Company. At 23:00 further artillery and mortar fire missions were ordered by the Australians against the North Koreans in response to renewed concentrations in preparation for an assault. Around the same time 8 Platoon C Company under Lieutenant Colin Townsend was sent across the bridge in the darkness to further reinforce B Company, and they dug-in on each side of the road leading to the bridge. Telephone lines had been laid by the Australians to their forward companies, and despite the fighting they remained intact throughout the battle.|$|E

25|$|Davidovich routed Vaubois in the Battle of Calliano on 7 November, inflicting 4,400 {{casualties}} on the French for an Austrian loss of 3,500.
