The pension program will give pension benefit to the goverment employees on their retirement age. Pension funding requires actuarial computation which normal cost and actuarial liability. Actuarial computation is divided into two major parts, Accrued Benefit Cost Method and Projected Benefit Cost Method. One of Accrued Benefit Cost Method example is Projected <b>Unit</b> <b>Credit</b> and for the Projected Benefit cost one of the method is Attained Age Normal.

Before reaching retirement age, {{there should be an}} actuarial cost, which includes the normal cost and actuarial liabilities. Both are calculated using actuarial cost methods. Actuarial cost methods are divided into two major categories, are Accrued Benefit Cost Method and Projected Benefit Cost Method. One example of the methods included in Accrued Benefit Cost Method is Projected <b>Unit</b> <b>Credit</b> Method, and one of the methods included in Projected Benefit Cost Method is Entry Age Normal Method.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to determine possible indicators that affect local <b>unit</b> <b>credit</b> risk and investigate their effect on default (credit risk) of local government units in Croatia. No system for the estimation of local <b>unit</b> <b>credit</b> risk has been established in Croatia so far causing many practical problems in local unit borrowing. Because of the specific nature of the operations of local government units and legislation that does not allow local government units to go into bankruptcy, conventional methods for estimating credit risk are not applicable, and the set of standard potential determinants of credit risk has to be expanded with new indicators. Thus in the paper, in addition to the usual determinants of credit risk, the hypothesis of the influence of political factors on local <b>unit</b> <b>credit</b> risk in Croatia is also tested out, with the use of a Tobit model. Results of econometric analysis show that credit risk of local government units in Croatia is affected by the political structure of local government, the proportion of income tax and surtax in operating revenue, the ratio of net operating balance, net financial liabilities and direct debt to operating revenue, as well as the ratio of debt repayment and cash, and direct debt and operating revenue...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} designing the pricing and return-credit strategy for a monopolistic manufacturer of single-period commodities. That is, given the unit manufacturing cost and the unit retail sale price, the manufacturer determines: (i) the unit price C to be charged against the retailer; and (ii) the <b>unit</b> <b>credit</b> V {{to be given to}} the retailer for units returned. While the manufacturer is allowed to set C and V, the order quantity Q is set by the retailer in response to the manufacturer's C and V. Among the unexpected findings derived from our model are: (i) unless an external force supports the retailer, otherwise the manufacturer can usually design a (C, V) -scheme that gives himself the lion's share of the profit; (ii) depending on the risk attitudes of the manufacturer and the retailer, the optimal return policy can range from 'no returns allowed' to 'unlimited returns with full credit'; (iii) instead of losing his profit share to the retailer, a return-credits agreement can often be manipulated by a shrewd manufacturer to increase his profit. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Models of accrediting work-based {{learning}} are now commonplace in universities. The {{purpose of this}} viewpoint paper is to highlight an opportunity for universities to not only accredit students’ part-time work against the degree award, but also to extend the process into schools by accrediting the part-time work undertaken by year 12 and 13 students against their future degree studies. The operations and benefit of adopting such an approach {{from the perspective of}} all stakeholders is discussed. By accrediting year 12 and 13 students, and giving appropriate <b>unit</b> <b>credit</b> against the subsequent degree studies provides universities with enhanced relationships, potential student buy-in and thereby, may increase recruitment. It also brings the employability agenda to the forefront and aids students’ transition into university. The approach described here offers universities a unique opportunity to, not only develop relationships with schools and colleges, but to encourage buy-in for students to progress onto degree programmes. While students’ part-time work activities have received much academic scrutiny, the suggestion of accrediting pre-university students’ work experience to gain accreditation from future degree studies offers a unique proposition for universities to consider. It also presents a number of challenges to make it work effectively and these too are outlined...|$|E

In this work, {{we consider the}} hybrid design offering a defined contribution benefit with a defined benefit guaranteed minimum underpin. This study applies the contingent claims approach to value the defined contribution benefit with a defined benefit guaranteed minimum underpin. The study shows that entry age, utility function parameters and the market price of risk each has {{a significant effect on}} the value of retirement benefits. We also consider risk management for this defined benefit underpin pension plan. Assuming fixed interest rates, and assuming that salaries can be treated as a tradable asset, contribution rates are developed for the Entry Age Normal (EAN), Projected Unit Credit(PUC), and Traditional <b>Unit</b> <b>Credit</b> (TUC) funding methods. For the EAN, the contribution rates are constant throughout the service period. However, the hedge parameters for this method are not tradable. For the accruals method, the individual contribution rates are not constant. For both the PUC and TUC, a delta hedge strategy is derived and explained. The analysis is extended to relax the tradable assumption for salaries, using the inflation as a partial hedge.
