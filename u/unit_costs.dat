5|$|In 2013, {{sequestration}} {{budget cuts}} {{cast doubt on}} the USAF's ability to complete the Combat Avionics Programmed Extension Suite (CAPES), a part of secondary programs such as Taiwan's F-16 upgrade. ACC's General Mike Hostage stated that if he only had money for SLEP (service life extension program) or CAPES, he would fund SLEP to keep the aircraft flying. Lockheed Martin responded to talk of CAPES cancellation with a fixed-price upgrade package for foreign users. CAPES {{was not included in the}} Pentagon's 2015 budget request. The USAF said that the upgrade package will still be offered to Taiwan, and Lockheed said that some common elements with the F-35 will keep the radar's <b>unit</b> <b>costs</b> down. In 2014 the USAF issued a RFI to SLEP 300 F-16 C/Ds.|$|E
5|$|IndiGo {{became one}} of the fastest growing low cost {{carriers}} in the world and was the largest profitable airline in India. The success of IndiGo has been attributed to its unique business model which reduces costs. The airline operates a single type of aircraft (Airbus A320) in similar seating configuration which simplifies crew training and maintenance. The airline strikes bulk deals with Airbus reducing <b>unit</b> <b>costs.</b> The airline targets a quick turn-around time of 20 minutes to get the aircraft ready for the next flight, ensuring planes fly about 12 hours every day. With this it has created an Indian record of more than 900 flights a day. Employees share multiple roles with a check-in staff doubling as a baggage handler.|$|E

5|$|StarCraft {{focuses around}} three {{distinct}} interstellar species: the psionic Protoss, the adaptable Terrans, and the insectoid Zerg. The game revolves around players collecting resources {{to construct a}} base, upgrade their militaries, and ultimately conquer opponents. Brood Wars gameplay remains fundamentally unchanged from that of StarCraft, although it made small alterations to <b>unit</b> <b>costs</b> and some abilities, and added some new units. These changes make rushing tactics—a factor that gained some criticism in the original StarCraft—less practical. The single-player campaign has an increased difficulty; missions are no longer entirely linear, and a greater focus on strategy is needed to complete missions. In addition, the game's artificial intelligence (AI) has been augmented so that AI-controlled players are more intelligent and tend to use tactics more effectively.|$|E
5|$|Another {{chance for}} the F-20 was as an upgrade for the Air National Guard (ANG). Northrop claimed that the F-20's fast {{scramble}} time made it a natural fit for this role, its lower cost would allow the ANG to operate larger aircraft numbers, and that it supported the AIM-7 while the F-16 did not. Additionally, the ANG would not be competing with the Air Force for production quotas, {{they would be able}} to replace their aircraft more quickly. However, the Air Force's requirements had priorities favoring the F-16 for the role; if the ANG flew the F-16, they would further lower <b>unit</b> <b>costs,</b> maintain commonality between the ANG and USAF, and better equip ANG units to perform front line combat roles. The Congressional Budget Office had also disputed Northrop's lower cost claim in their own research. On 31 October 1986, the Air Force announced that the F-16C had been selected, which had been upgraded to support the AIM-7. As several nations had suggested they would accept the F-20 on the condition that it was inducted into the USAF, the selection was a heavy blow to Northrop.|$|E

25|$|The <b>unit</b> <b>cost</b> of the H-60 models varies due to {{differences}} in specifications, equipment and quantities.

25|$|The rapidity of {{typographical}} text production, {{as well as}} {{the sharp}} fall in <b>unit</b> <b>costs,</b> led to the issuing of the first newspapers (see Relation) which opened up an entirely new field for conveying up-to-date information to the public.|$|E
25|$|These {{effects are}} often {{expressed}} graphically. The curve is plotted with the cumulative units produced on the horizontal axis and unit cost on the vertical axis. A curve showing a 15% cost reduction for every doubling of output is called an “85% experience curve”, indicating that <b>unit</b> <b>costs</b> drop to 85% {{of their original}} level.|$|E
25|$|Snowflake {{incurred}} {{the same}} overhead costs as Scandinavian; {{the lack of}} a clear separation between the airlines at an operational level meant that Snowflake never succeeded in lowering <b>unit</b> <b>costs</b> below that of Scandinavian Airlines. Finally, operating only four aircraft was too small a fleet to achieve the necessary economy of scale. With the ticket prices based on cost savings which never materialized, the airline failed to operate with a profit.|$|E
30|$|Since {{the profit}} is derived by {{subtracting}} the price by the <b>unit</b> <b>cost,</b> a lower <b>unit</b> <b>cost</b> immediately increases the profit.|$|R
30|$|Reducing the <b>unit</b> <b>cost</b> of each {{product is}} a goal that is pursued by every factory. However, the results of cost {{reduction}} actions are often overestimated, resulting in unreliable and misleading <b>unit</b> <b>cost</b> estimates that undermine financial or production planning. To resolve this problem and to enhance the effectiveness of <b>unit</b> <b>cost</b> estimation, a new FCI approach is proposed in this study. The new FCI approach is novel because it handles the original value, rather than the logarithmic or log-sigmoid value, of the <b>unit</b> <b>cost</b> directly, unlike existing methods. Such a treatment {{is believed to be}} a viable way to truly optimize the precision or accuracy of the <b>unit</b> <b>cost</b> estimation.|$|R
30|$|The <b>unit</b> <b>cost</b> is both {{a direct}} {{performance}} measure and an indirect performance measure. Before production, {{a reduction in the}} prices of raw materials is directly reflected in the <b>unit</b> <b>cost</b> of the finished goods. After production, a higher yield results in more output that drives down the <b>unit</b> <b>cost</b> further.|$|R
25|$|During 2003 SAS was {{undergoing}} a major restructuring program, which largely focused on reducing <b>unit</b> <b>costs.</b> As {{part of this}} work, the company's management in cooperation with McKinsey & Company devised a scheme to better target the leisure market. Inspiration was both gathered from Ryanair and SAS' partner airline Lufthansa's low-cost subsidiary Germanwings. SAS had just bought its main Norwegian competitor, Braathens, and had also cleared {{out most of the}} Swedish domestic competition through the purchase of Linjeflyg. The airline was worried about new entrants in these markets, and was especially concerned with Ryanair and EasyJet.|$|E
25|$|Japanese {{officials}} {{have claimed that}} the P-1 is a more capable, albeit more expensive, aircraft than the Boeing P-8 Poseidon; {{in comparison to the}} P-8, the P-1 has a greater range, a larger bomb bay, and has been purpose-built for the maritime patrol mission. Prior to 2015, the P-1 was being procured at a typical rate of one or two aircraft deliveries per year; in 2015, this changed to a bulk order for 20 P-1s as part of a measure to cut the aircraft's <b>unit</b> <b>costs.</b> By October 2016, 10 P-1s had been delivered to the JMSDF, with 60 or more aircraft needed to replace Japan's P-3C fleet; production will rise to about five annually.|$|E
25|$|Before the 20th century, all maize {{harvesting}} was by manual labour, by grazing, or by {{some combination}} of those. Whether the ears were hand-picked and the stover was grazed, or the whole plant was cut, gathered, and shocked, people and livestock did all the work. Between the 1890s and the 1970s, the technology of maize harvesting expanded greatly. Today, all such technologies, from entirely manual harvesting to entirely mechanized, are still in use to some degree, as appropriate to each farm's needs, although the thoroughly mechanized versions predominate, as they offer the lowest <b>unit</b> <b>costs</b> when scaled to large farm operations. For small farms, their unit cost can be too high, as their higher fixed cost cannot be amortized over as many units.|$|E
30|$|The {{contribution}} {{of this study}} is the designing of the PP formulations that can deal with the original value of the <b>unit</b> <b>cost</b> in modeling the uncertain <b>unit</b> <b>cost</b> learning process, which is the first attempt in this field and has great potential of improving the precision and accuracy of estimating the <b>unit</b> <b>cost.</b>|$|R
30|$|In addition, {{estimating}} the <b>unit</b> <b>cost</b> of each product accurately {{is a prerequisite}} to determining the profitability of a manufacturer. However, owing to the prevalent “cost down” philosophy, many manufacturers incorrectly expect that the <b>unit</b> <b>cost</b> of a product can be reduced in a linear way. This is a misunderstanding because if a linear cost-down works out, the <b>unit</b> <b>cost</b> will eventually become negative. For this reason, fitting {{the reduction in the}} <b>unit</b> <b>cost</b> of a product with a learning process has become a common practice [28].|$|R

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, even though two-sided pricing {{strategies}} generally increase total platform profits compared to traditional one-sided strategies, the actual end {{value of the}} two-sided pricing strategy is contingent on market characteristics and may not offset the costs of implementation. For example, profits of an application provider increase {{with the implementation of}} a two-sided pricing strategy of the platform provider only if the application is subsidized by the provider. Platform providers should also be more cautious when the giveaway product has appreciable <b>unit</b> <b>costs,</b> as with tangible goods. Free-PC incurred $80M in losses in 1999 when it decided to give away computers and Internet access at no cost to consumers who agreed to view Internet-delivered ads that could not be minimized or hidden. Unfortunately, willingness to pay does not materialize on the money side, as few marketers were eager to target consumers who were so cost conscious.|$|E
25|$|Olds {{ended his}} tour with the 2 BG by {{developing}} plans to reduce <b>unit</b> <b>costs</b> of new B-17s to facilitate procurement of 42 more bombers, and to train new aircrews without any reduction of {{standards in the}} face of an estimated expansion rate of 800%. Olds' next assignment was to the Plans Division of the Office of Chief of the Air Corps on January 5, 1940, working for Spaatz, who had been promoted to brigadier general. Olds advanced to colonel on October 16, 1940. While working in the Plans Division, he received a suggestion from Nancy Love, a woman aviator (and wife of an Air Corps Reserve friend, 1st Lt. Robert Love), that he give serious consideration of the use of women pilots to ferry new aircraft from the factory in case of war. Olds replied by asking her to provide him with a list of women pilots with commercial pilot ratings.|$|E
25|$|The United States' {{entry into}} World War II impeded Baldwin's Diesel {{development}} program when the War Production Board dictated that Alco and Baldwin produce only steamers and Diesel-electric yard switching engines. Electro-Motive Division (EMD) was assigned {{the task of}} producing road freight Diesels (namely, the FT series). EMD's distinct advantage over its competitors in that product line {{in the years that}} followed World War II, due to the head start in diesel R and production, is beyond doubt, however, assigning it solely to WPB directives is questionable. Longtime GM chairman Alfred P. Sloan presented a timeline in his memoir that belies this assumption, saying that GM's diesel-engine R efforts of the 1920s and 1930s, and its application of model design standardization (yielding lower <b>unit</b> <b>costs)</b> and marketing lessons learned in the automotive industry, were the principal reason for EMD's competitive advantage in the late 1940s and afterward (clearly implying that the wartime production assignments were merely nails in a coffin that Baldwin and Lima had already built for themselves before the war). In his telling, the R needed to adapt earlier Diesels (best suited to marine and stationary use) to locomotive use (smaller; higher power-to-weight ratio; more reliable given more vibration and less maintenance) was a capital-intensive project that almost no one among the railroad owners or locomotive builders was willing (latter) or able (former) to invest in during the 1920s and 1930s, save the people of Winton, Electro-Motive, and Charles F. Kettering of the GM Research Corporation.|$|E

30|$|In the past, the {{application}} of fuzzy logic to the <b>unit</b> <b>cost</b> estimation did not receive much attention in the manufacturing sector [21]. However, the great potential has been mentioned by studies like Chang et al. [8]. Recently, some studies proposed fuzzy methods, especially FCI methods, to estimate the <b>unit</b> <b>cost</b> of a product. The FCI methods gather several experts that apply fuzzy methods to estimate the <b>unit</b> <b>cost</b> of a product [24]. Then, the fuzzy <b>unit</b> <b>cost</b> estimates from the experts are aggregated [25]. For example, Chen [10] proposed an FCI method in which experts fitted fuzzy linear regression (FLR) equations to estimate the effective cost per die of a semiconductor product. Then, the fuzzy <b>unit</b> <b>cost</b> estimates from the experts were aggregated using the FI-BPN approach. Hsiao et al. [18] applied fuzzy neural network (FNN) and genetic algorithm jointly to estimating the hookup construction cost of a semiconductor fabrication plant. Chen [11] proposed another FCI method in which experts configured FNNs to estimate the <b>unit</b> <b>cost</b> and then a radial basis function (RBF) network was used to aggregate the fuzzy <b>unit</b> <b>cost</b> estimates.
