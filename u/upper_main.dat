5|$|Main-sequence stars employ {{two types}} of {{hydrogen}} fusion processes, {{and the rate of}} energy generation from each type depends on the temperature in the core region. Astronomers divide the main sequence into upper and lower parts, based on which of the two is the dominant fusion process. In the lower main sequence, energy is primarily generated {{as the result of the}} proton-proton chain, which directly fuses hydrogen together in a series of stages to produce helium. Stars in the <b>upper</b> <b>main</b> sequence have sufficiently high core temperatures to efficiently use the CNO cycle. (See the chart.) This process uses atoms of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen as intermediaries in the process of fusing hydrogen into helium.|$|E

25|$|The Galleria was a {{proposed}} skyscraper and mall {{during the early}} 1980s in Lexington, Kentucky bounded by <b>Upper,</b> <b>Main,</b> South Mill and Vine Streets. The primary developer of the 24 level complex was the Webb Cos.; retail was to occupy the lower three levels with offices occupying the remainder. It was never constructed after failing to attract a major department store; the original plans called for two major anchor stores with numerous smaller shops and a fast food court covering two downtown blocks. The state of Kentucky had approved $15 million in economic revenue bonds for both the Galleria and the World Coal Center.|$|E
500|$|Grand Teton National Park {{is named}} for Grand Teton, the tallest {{mountain}} in the Teton Range. The naming of the mountains is attributed to early 19th-century French-speaking trappers—les trois tétons (the three teats) was later anglicized and shortened to Tetons. At , Grand Teton abruptly rises more than [...] above Jackson Hole, almost [...] higher than Mount Owen, the second-highest summit in the range. The park has numerous lakes, including [...] Jackson Lake as well as streams of varying length and the <b>upper</b> <b>main</b> stem of the Snake River. Though {{in a state of}} recession, a dozen small glaciers persist at the higher elevations near the highest peaks in the range. Some of the rocks in the park are the oldest found in any U.S. National Park and have been dated at nearly 2.7billion years.|$|E

500|$|At {{a stellar}} core {{temperature}} of 18 million Kelvin, the PP process and CNO cycle are equally efficient, and each type generates {{half of the}} star's net luminosity. As this is the core temperature of a star with about 1.5 , the <b>upper</b> <b>main</b> sequence consists of stars above this mass. Thus, roughly speaking, stars of spectral class F or cooler belong to the lower main sequence, while A-type stars or hotter are upper main-sequence stars. The transition in primary energy production from one form to the other spans a range difference of less than a single solar mass. In the Sun, a one solar-mass star, only 1.5% of the energy is generated by the CNO cycle. By contrast, stars with 1.8 [...] or above generate almost their entire energy output through the CNO cycle.|$|E
500|$|The main {{sequence}} is sometimes divided into {{upper and lower}} parts, based on the dominant process that a star uses to generate energy. Stars below about 1.5 times {{the mass of the}} Sun (...) primarily fuse hydrogen atoms together in a series of stages to form helium, a sequence called the proton–proton chain. Above this mass, in the <b>upper</b> <b>main</b> sequence, the nuclear fusion process mainly uses atoms of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen as intermediaries in the CNO cycle that produces helium from hydrogen atoms. Main-sequence stars with more than two solar masses undergo convection in their core regions, which acts to stir up the newly created helium and maintain the proportion of fuel needed for fusion to occur. Below this mass, stars have cores that are entirely radiative with convective zones near the surface. With decreasing stellar mass, the proportion of the star forming a convective envelope steadily increases, whereas main-sequence stars below [...] undergo convection throughout their mass. When core convection does not occur, a helium-rich core develops surrounded by an outer layer of hydrogen.|$|E

2500|$|After {{crossing}} a creek {{in the middle}} of the village, NY203 enters downtown Valatie, intersecting with Main Street, which proceeds westward to connect with US9. NY203 however proceeds eastward along Main, {{crossing a}}n intersection that leads to CR28A (<b>Upper</b> <b>Main</b> Street). NY203 proceeds north on Mechanic Street, a two-lane commercial street in the northeastern corner of the village. At Church Street, the route bends northeast, leaving downtown Valatie and soon back into the town of Kinderhook. In Kinderhook, NY203 becomes a two-lane residential street, passing southeast of the hamlet of Valatie Corner and into a junction with CR28 (Main Street / Newton Hill Road).|$|E
2500|$|Streamliners {{used the}} larger B-body and, {{except for the}} station wagons, used {{fastback}} styling. The 1941 Super models with folding center armrest were known as Chieftains in 1942. All Pontiacs looked lower, heavier and wider. Extension caps on the front doors lengthened the forward fender lines. The hood extended {{back to the front}} doors, eliminating the cowl. The grille, bumper and hood were widened and headlamps were further apart. Long horizontal parking lamps sat just above the vertical side grilles. The horseshoe shaped center grille had horizontal bars and a circular emblem {{in the middle of the}} <b>upper</b> <b>main</b> surround molding. The word Pontiac appeared on the hood side molding of six-cylinder models, while the moldings of the eight-cylinder cars said Pontiac Eight. After December 15, 1941, wartime [...] "blackout" [...] trim was used. All parts previously chrome plated were finished in Duco Gun Metal Grey.|$|E
