5|$|Solo {{was born}} in Richland, Washington on July 30, 1981 to Judy Lynn (née Shaw) and Jeffrey Solo. Her father, an Italian-American Vietnam War veteran, who {{was in and out}} of her life as a child and teenager, taught her how to play soccer at a young age. When Solo was seven, her father picked her and her brother Marcus <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to a {{baseball}} game in the nearby city of Yakima, but ended up driving over three hours west to Seattle, where they stayed for several days at a hotel. Solo described how it seemed like a vacation at first, but soon realized it was not. Police later found them at a downtown bank and arrested Jeffrey for alleged kidnapping. Although her parents had divorced when she was six and she lived with her mother, Solo maintained a close relationship with her father after reconnecting with him during her college years at the University of Washington. He continued to be a major influence in her life until his death of a heart attack in June 2007.|$|E

25|$|Following on, Laborit {{considered}} whether chlorpromazine {{may have}} a role in managing patients with severe burns, Raynaud's phenomenon, or psychiatric disorders. At the Villejuif Mental Hospital in November 1951, he and Montassut administered an intravenous dose to psychiatrist Cornelia Quarti who was acting as a volunteer. Quarti noted the indifference, but fainted upon getting <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the toilet, and so further testing was discontinued (orthostatic hypotension is a possible side effect of chlorpromazine). Despite this, Laborit continued to push for testing in psychiatric patients during early 1952. Psychiatrists were reluctant initially, but on January 19, 1952, it was administered (alongside pethidine, pentothal and ECT) to Jacques Lh. a 24-year-old manic patient, who responded dramatically, and was discharged after three weeks having received 855mg of the drug in total.|$|E

25|$|While {{reading the}} book Paul gave her, Connie finds his phone number inside. Connie calls Paul from Grand Central Station for his address, but he invites her over for coffee instead. Paul reads Connie a book in Braille amidst mild flirting. Connie, despite her {{feelings}} of attraction, leaves. Connie is unable to stop thinking about Paul, and decides to visit him {{with a bag of}} muffins. After Connie and Paul have a dance, she stops, saying she can't continue, and leaves. When she returns to retrieve her coat, Paul literally sweeps her off her feet and into his bed. While on the train ride home via the Metro-North Railroad, Connie, in tears, recalls their sexual encounter in flashbacks. She is thrilled by the sexual attention she is receiving from a younger man, but feels guilty at the same time. Connie uses her work for a charity event as an excuse to go into the city to visit Paul more frequently. Edward almost immediately senses something and sees subtle changes in her, which is confirmed by an inconsistency in an excuse she uses to visit the city one day. One morning he notices that Connie is fixing herself <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into the city, with brand new shoes and lingerie draped over a chair, and he tells Connie he will wait for her so they can go into the city together. She urges him to go without her, that she won't be ready for quite a while, so he tries to get her to agree to meet him for lunch, but she says she has a salon appointment and won't be able to meet him. Later on, at the office, suspecting Connie is lying, Edward calls the salon she mentioned and it is confirmed that she doesn't have an appointment that day.|$|E

It was written by American musician Prince, using the pseudonym [...] "Christopher". Originally intended for the group Apollonia 6 in 1984, he offered the song to The Bangles two years later. Lyrically, it describes {{a woman who is}} waking <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to work on Monday, wishing it were still Sunday where she could relax.|$|E

Surprised and obviously disappointed, Jim makes an unwise comment that at least he didn't leave her at a high school hockey game, in reference to Pam's earlier revelation of what Roy had done on her worst date ever. Pam is clearly upset and gets <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> send some faxes, leaving it awkward between her and Jim, who tries unsuccessfully to apologize.|$|E

KCDC convinces JTRO that the FP needs him because L Dubba E has taken control of the local alcohol {{industry}} and is refusing to sell alcoholic drinks to everyone.

500|$|The Tyneside Theatre company {{presented}} a stage version of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight at the University Theatre, Newcastle at Christmas 1971. It {{was directed by}} Michael Bogdanov and adapted for the stage from the translation by Brian Stone. The music and lyrics were composed by Iwan Williams using medieval carols, such as the Boar's Head Carol, as inspiration and folk instruments such as the Northumbrian pipes, whistles and bhodran to create a [...] "rough" [...] feel. Stone had referred Bogdanov to Cuchulain and the Beheading Game, a sequence which is contained in The Grenoside Sword dance. Bogdanov found the pentangle theme to be contained in most sword dances, and so incorporated a long sword dance while Gawain lay tossing uneasily before getting <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the Green Chapel. The dancers made the knot of the pentangle around his drowsing head with their swords. The interlacing of the hunting and wooing scenes was achieved by frequent cutting of the action from hunt to bed-chamber and back again, while the locale of both remained on-stage.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Prophecy of Blood" [...] {{is unusual}} in two ways: {{it is the first}} of Bartholomew of Sandwich's prophecies to feature a repeating [...] "refrain"; and it is carved {{backwards}} in a tight corner of the prophecy room, so that a mirror is required to read it. Nerissa tells Gregor she believes Sandwich purposely made it [...] "difficult to read" [...] in order to emphasize {{how difficult it is to}} understand, and Gregor later hypothesizes that Sandwich forced the humans to read it using mirrors so that, as a person read, [...] " [...] would see [...] ". Ripred similarly points out that an [...] "annoying little dance" [...] Boots makes <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> along with the prophecy's refrain echoes this theme, by forcing the questers to turn and see themselves before they realize that the plague originated with the humans. Boots's [...] "help" [...] deciphering this prophecy leads characters to rely on her to do the same in the series's later books. In Gregor and the Marks of Secret, Boots begins dancing to a song Sandwich carved [...] "in the nursery, not the room of prophecies" [...] after the characters witness the mass execution of a group of nibblers and becomes [...] "totally convinced" [...] that the song is actually yet another prophecy. In Gregor and the Code of Claw, when the [...] "Prophecy of Time" [...] calls for a [...] "princess" [...] to crack a cryptogram, Boots is immediately assigned the role because of her importance to the last two prophecies, despite the fact that she is still a toddler.|$|E

2500|$|By 1941, {{while still}} at the conservatory, Mackerras began to get {{professional}} performing jobs in Sydney, partly {{because he was too}} young to join the military, while older musicians had been called <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the war. From 1941 to 1942, Mackerras played the oboe for the J. C. Williamson Company during one of their Gilbert and Sullivan seasons, and he was a rehearsal pianist for the Kirsova ballet company. In 1943, Mackerras joined the ABC Sydney Orchestra, under Malcolm Sargent, as second oboist and at age 19, became principal oboist. On [...] 1947, Mackerras sailed for England on the RMS Rangitiki intending to pursue conducting. He joined Sadler's Wells Theatre as an orchestral oboist and cor anglais player. He later won a British Council Scholarship, enabling him to study conducting with Václav Talich at the Prague Academy of Music. While there, he formed a strong friendship with Jiří Tancibudek, Principal Oboe of the Czech Philharmonic, who introduced him to the operas of Leoš Janáček, thus commencing Mackerras's lifelong passion for that composer's music.|$|E
