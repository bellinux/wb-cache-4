These materials are produced both as woven and nonwoven fabrics and are available in varying weights and porosities. Fabric selection is based on the proposed application and the specifications that the desired material must meet. If filter fabric is selected as the stabilization technology that is to be used, it has the advantage of being available from several manufacturers whose products are competitively priced. These materials, regardless of manufacturer, are relatively inert geosynthetics that are resistant to ultra-violent degeneration...|$|E

Unlike many previous studies that facilitated a learner’s logical thought, we attempted to facilitate learner’s affective thought by developing an af-fective critical reading tool called EMU (Emotional and Motivational <b>Underliner)</b> because recent studies in cognitive science suggest that affective thought should facilitate appropriate problem finding. One of the characteristic functions of the EMU is affective tagging, and we predicted that affective tagging would prompt a learner writing an essay to find suitable problems from an article for her/his essay. Subsequently, an experiment was conducted to examine this hypothesis, and the results provided support for the affective tagging...|$|E
40|$|Leachate {{emitted by}} {{landfilled}} {{municipal solid waste}} may cause many and cumulative adverse effects ranging from health problems to environmental impacts. South Africa {{is one of the}} few countries in the developing world to have a sound regulatory framework for waste disposal by landfill. Municipal solid waste, however, is not differentiated by content. It is well established that the characteristics of waste produced by affluent suburbs are very different from poor suburbs and informal settlements. The regulatory framework for landfilling is presented as a set of the Minimum Requirements that specifies the design of landfills on the basis of the potential to generate leachate and the type of waste being disposed. The current study interrogates aspects of the Minimum Requirements classification system, namely the classification of waste and climatic water balance. The climatic water balance is used as a guiding tool to assess the potential for a landfill to generate leachate. The end result of this classification is a determination of the proposed site falls under B+ (water surplus) or B- (water deficient) class. The Minimum Requirements ensure that all sites which fall under the B+ class must be equipped with an <b>underliner</b> owing to the potential for leachate generation, while B- sites do not require any <b>underliner</b> since leachate will be only generated sporadically. However, there is no differentiation on the basis of the content of municipal solid waste from rich and poor suburbs. The present study investigates the generation of leachate from landfills situated on the borderline between B+ and B- sites, as well as the degradation of refuse having a range of basic constituents, and representing waste from rich and poor suburbs, as well as a mixture of the two. Laboratory lysimeters were filled with synthetic waste consisting of varying proportions of paper, putrescible material (grass cuttings) and coal ash (power station fly ash was used to ensure consistency). This was intended mimic the waste coming from “poor” and “rich” suburbs in South Africa. The effect of waste types grading from “poor” to “rich” on leachate quality was investigated. It has been found that a content of 60...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{landfill}} caps for semi-arid and arid climates The United States EPA Subtitle D {{municipal solid}} waste land-fill requirements specify that the permeability of a cap to a land-fill be no greater than the permeability of the <b>underliner.</b> In recent years {{the concept of the}} evapotranspirative (ET) cap has been developed in which the cap is designed to store all rain infiltration and re-evapotranspire it during dry weather. Con-cern at the long period required for landfilled {{municipal solid waste}} to decompose and stabilize in arid and semi-arid climates has led to an extension of the concept of the ET cap. With the infiltrate–stabilize–evapotranspire (ISE) cap, rain infiltration during wet weather is permitted to enter the underlying waste, thus accelerating the decomposition and stabilization proc-ess. Excess infiltration is then removed from both waste and cap by evaporation during dry weather. The paper describes the construction and operation of two sets of experimental ISE caps, one in a winter rainfall semi-arid climate, and the other in a summer rainfall semi-arid climate. Observation of the rainfall, soil evaporation and amount of water stored in the caps has allowed water balances to be constructed for caps of various thicknesses. These observations show that the ISE concept is viable. In the limit, when there is insufficient rain-fall to infiltrate the waste, an ISE cap operates as an ET cap...|$|E
