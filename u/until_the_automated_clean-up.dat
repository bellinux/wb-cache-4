40|$|Abstract The {{study and}} {{extension}} {{of a simple}} <b>automated</b> <b>clean-up</b> method for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF) to {{a broad range of}} polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) is de-scribed. The isolation of seven PCDD, ten PCDF, and three coplanar PCB (cPCB) is extended to eight mono-ortho substituted PCB and seven so-called “marker PCB” (Aroclor 1260) for fatty food samples. This enables quan-tification of 35 compounds – including all congeners with a WHO toxic equivalent factor (TEF) – in a single extrac-tion and single purification step. The chromatographic be-haviour of mono-ortho PCB and marker PCB on a variety of adsorbents, including basic alumina, has been studied. Partitioning of analytes through multi-column sequences is described and correlated with their structural and elec-tronic properties, by use of molecular modelling calcula-tions. The fractionation process available with <b>the</b> Power-Prep <b>automated</b> <b>clean-up</b> system enables rapid indepen-dent analysis of the different groups of compounds. Gas chromatography with high resolution mass spectrometry (GC–HRMS) is used for the PCDD/F and cPCB fraction and quadrupole ion-storage tandem in time mass spec-trometry (GC–QISTMS) for analysis of the remaining PCB. A comparison study was performed on quality-con-trol samples and real fatty food samples to evaluate the ro-bustness of the new strategy compared with a reference method. On the basis of this simultaneous clean-up, a rapid simplified strategy for PCDD/F and selected PCB analysis determination is proposed for fatty food samples...|$|R
50|$|Some 26 {{months after}} the Earth Return Vehicle is {{originally}} launched from Earth, a second vehicle, the Mars Habitat Unit, would be launched on a 6-month long low-energy transfer trajectory to Mars, and would carry a crew of four astronauts (the minimum number required so that the team can be split in two without leaving anyone alone). The Habitat Unit would not be launched <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>automated</b> factory aboard <b>the</b> ERV had signaled the successful production of chemicals required for operation on the planet and the return trip to Earth. During the trip, artificial gravity would be generated by tethering the Habitat Unit to the spent upper stage of the booster, and setting them rotating about a common axis. This rotation would produce a comfortable 1 g working environment for the astronauts, freeing them of the debilitating effects of long-term exposure to weightlessness.|$|R

All these compounds fall under or are candidate to the Stockholm Convention and {{they are subject to}} United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) monitoring programmes 1. In the past, different complex <b>automated</b> <b>clean-up</b> systems have been developed and dedicated to the analysis of dioxins in environmental samples. Later these methodologies have been adapted to include other conventional or emerging persistent organic compounds such as PCBs and PBDEs 2, 3, 4. These methodologies involve different types of adsorption media such as acidic silica/silica, alumina and active carbon and are useful if multiresidual analysis with PCDD/Fs analysis in a final step is applied. Often the monitoring of these chemicals do not include all these compounds, but is limited to only a few classes excluding the PCDD/Fs, so that a reduced number of clean up steps are needed and time and cost expenses reduced [...] In this study we tested the flexibility of an <b>automated</b> <b>clean-up</b> system used for the multiresidual analysis 5 developing a shorter and simpler <b>automated</b> method for <b>the</b> simultaneous analysis of PCBs and PBDEs in fish. For this purpose we reduced the clean up steps to GPC followed by acidic silica/silica columns. <b>The</b> <b>automated</b> clean up system (J 2 Scientific, Missouri, USA) consists of a gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with autosampler (AccuPrep MPSTM), an evaporator system (AccuVapTM) and three solid phase module able to manage the acid silica/neutral silica, basic alumina and active carbon columns (Dioxin/SPE module) in-line.

To use spectra {{acquired}} by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) from pre- and post-digital rectal examination (DRE) urine samples {{to search for}} discriminating peaks that can adequately distinguish between benign and malignant prostate conditions, and identify the peaks’ underlying biomolecules. METHODS. Twenty-five participants with prostate cancer (PCa) and 27 participants {{with a variety of}} benign prostatic conditions as confirmed by a 10 -core tissue biopsy were included. Pre- and post-DRE urine samples were prepared for MALDI MS profiling using an <b>automated</b> <b>clean-up</b> procedure. Following mass spectra collection and processing, peak mass and intensity were extracted and subjected to statistical analysis to identify peaks capable of distinguishing between benign and cancer.

Many of the residents were crofting families who had themselves been cleared from more fertile land on Raasay. In May 1921, a group of crofters from Rona landed on Raasay and attempted to re-occupy their ancestral land. These so-called [...] "Raasay Raiders" [...] were arrested, tried and given jail sentences, but public support for them was strong and they were eventually freed and allowed to remain on Raasay. This led in 1922 to the acquisition of both Rona and Raasay from their private landlord by the British Government. After this, the population of Rona fell sharply, as most of the island's inhabitants followed the Raiders to settle on Raasay.
