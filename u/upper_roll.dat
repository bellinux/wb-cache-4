60|$|Fourthly: Byzantine bases, if {{they have}} an {{incision}} between the <b>upper</b> <b>roll</b> and cavetto, are very apt to approach the form of fig. 23, in which the <b>upper</b> <b>roll</b> is {{cut out of the}} flat block, and the ledge beneath it is sloping. Compare Nos. 7, 8, 9, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26. On the other hand, the later Gothic base, 11, has always its <b>upper</b> <b>roll</b> well developed, and, generally, the fillet between it and the cavetto vertical. The sloping fillet is indeed found down to late periods; and the vertical fillet, as in No. 12, in Byzantine ones; but still, when a base has such a sloping fillet and peculiarly graceful sweeping cavetto, as those of No. 10, looking as if they would run into one line with each other, it is strong presumptive evidence of its belonging to an early, rather than a late period.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} was to examine vestibular contributions at specific times during the initiation of walking in human subjects. Subjects began walking forward {{at the sound of}} an auditory tone, with vision present or occluded. Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) was delivered with the anode electrode on the right or left side at either: (1) onset of the anticipatory postural adjustment (APA), (2) toe-off of the first swing limb (TO) or (3) heel contact of the first swing limb (HC). Ground reaction forces and kinematic data were collected. <b>Upper</b> body (<b>roll</b> angles from head, trunk and pelvis) and lower body (foot placement) data were analysed to determine whether the timing and magnitude of the response to GVS, and therefore the level of vestibular contribution, was modulated at different points during the initiation of gait. With vision present and occluded, the magnitude of the lower body response varied depending on the event in the gait cycle at which the stimulation was delivered. These novel results demonstrate evidence that vestibular weighting during gait initiation is dependent upon the specific gait initiation events. <b>Upper</b> body <b>roll</b> also exhibited magnitude differences between events. However, these changes are proposed to occur due to the transition from a stationary position into a dynamic state, prompting the increased weighting of vestibular information. With vision present no significant changes were seen in the segment roll response. The observations suggest a distinction in vestibular regulation of <b>upper</b> body <b>roll</b> versus foot placement for successful completion of the gait initiation task. Changes in <b>upper</b> body <b>roll</b> are influenced by the dynamic nature of the task, whereas foot placement changes are modulated based on the event during gait initiation at which GVS is delivered...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} {{was to determine the}} interaction between visual and vestibular information during the transition from quiet standing to the completion of a forward step. Six subjects were asked to take one step forward at the sound of an audio tone, with their eyes open or closed, and terminate the step in a standing position. During stimulation trials, galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) was delivered 1500 ms before the auditory cue. GVS was delivered at an intensity three-fold that of each subject 2 ̆ 7 s quiet stance threshold with either stimulus right, left or no stimulation. Force data were collected from three forceplates for the calculation of centre of pressure (CoP), and kinematic data were used to calculate centre of mass (CoM) and body trajectories. In quiet stance all subjects responded to the GVS perturbation by demonstrating <b>upper</b> body segment <b>roll</b> and whole body sway towards the anode electrode. Unexpectedly, in the presence of vision during quiet stance, the <b>upper</b> body <b>roll</b> response was not attenuated, even though the CoP sway patterns were reduced when vision was available. During the initiation phase of the step, despite ongoing GVS stimulation, there were no significant effects seen in CoM, CoP or <b>upper</b> body <b>roll</b> responses. During step execution, however, both CoM displacement and <b>upper</b> body <b>roll</b> demonstrated significant effects and both responses were significantly reduced when subjects 2 ̆ 7 eyes were open. Analysis of the medio-lateral CoP integrals also indicated a strong stimulation effect between conditions late in the execution phase, which were largely attenuated with vision. The results suggest that the importance of visual and vestibular information varies depending on the phase of the task. In addition, the different integration between visual and vestibular input during quiet standing suggests a dual role for vestibular information. We propose that vestibular information in quiet standing has a role in maintaining whole body postural stability, as well as playing an integral role in the alignment of the body segments in preparation for proper movement execution. Vision was demonstrated to differentially attenuate these responses based on the phase of the task. Thus, visual and vestibular information appear to be integrated differently across the different phases of a forward-stepping task...|$|R

GVS was delivered 1, 500 ms prior to a cue to step. Ground reaction forces were collected from three force platforms and movement was recorded from IRED markers placed bilaterally on the body. The results showed that, following slight deviations caused by GVS onset, the step initiation behaviour was unaffected, but lateral deviations were found during the latter, more dynamic, phases of stepping for centre of mass trajectories, time integrals of the centre of pressure displacement and <b>upper</b> body <b>roll.</b> These findings showed that vestibular information is used differently across the execution of a step without vision.

40|$|The {{formation}} of longitudinal off-corner depressions or “gutters ” in continuous-cast steel slabs {{has been investigated}} using coupled finite-element models. Thermal-mechanical behavior of the solidifying shell has been simulated as it moves down through the mold and <b>upper</b> support <b>rolls</b> in the spray chamber. The calculation includes solidification, intermittent gap formation, plastic creep, bulging due to ferrostatic pressure, interaction with the mold and rolls, and phase transformations. The effects of turbulent flow in the liquid pool, flow and melting of the powder layers, superheat dissipation, taper, and thermal distortion of the mold walls are accounted for using separate models. Together, these models illustrate a multi-stage mechanism for gutter formation. The problem starts with a hot, thin region down the off-corner wide face. This {{may be caused by}} locally-inadequate liquid powder feeding, or by insufficient taper of the upper portion of the narrow face mold walls, allowing corner rotation within the mold. Depressions may then be created by excessive taper, buckling the thin shell near mold exit. Alternatively, they may evolve during bulging between support rolls below the mold, due to bending of the thin off-corner region. The results suggest that the problem can be avoided by optimizing the mold flow pattern and powder properties to obtai...|$|R
