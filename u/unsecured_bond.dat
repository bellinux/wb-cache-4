40|$|This paper re-examines the {{evidence}} {{on the relationship between}} credit spreads and economic activity. We construct a new credit spread index, employing an extensive micro-level data set of secondary market prices of outstanding senior <b>unsecured</b> <b>bonds</b> over the 1973 – 2009 period. Compared with the standard default-risk and other finan-cial indicators, our credit spread index is a robust predictor of future economic growth across a variety of economic indicators, sample periods, and forecast horizons. Using an empirical bond-pricing framework, we also decompose our credit spread index into a predictable component that captures the available firm-specific information on expected defaults and a residual component—the excess bond premium—which we argue reflects the price of default risk rather than the risk of default. Our results indicate that a sub-stantial portion of the predictive content of credit spreads for economic activity is due to the excess bond premium. Shocks to the excess bond premium that are orthogonal to {{the current state of the}} economy, the Treasury term structure, and stock returns are shown to cause significant declines in consumption, investment, and output as well as in equity prices. Overall, our findings are consistent with the notion that an increase in the excess bond premium reflects a reduction in the risk appetite of the financial sector and, as a result, a contraction in the supply of credit with significant adverse consequences for the macroeconomy...|$|R
40|$|We {{construct}} a new credit spread index, employing an extensive micro-level data set of secondary market prices of outstanding senior <b>unsecured</b> <b>bonds</b> over the 1973 – 2009 period. Compared {{with the standard}} default-risk indicators such as the Baa-Aaa corporate bond spread and the paper-bill spread, our credit spread index is a robust predictor of future economic activity {{across a variety of}} economic indicators, sample periods, and forecast horizons. Using a flexible empirical bond-pricing framework, we decompose our creditspreadindex into apredictable component that captures the available firm-specific information on default risk and a residual component—the so-called excess bond premium. The results indicate that {{a substantial portion of the}} predictive content of our credit spread index for economic activity is attributable to the excess bond premium. Indeed, in the post- 1985 period, the excess bond premium accounts for all of the predictive content of our credit spread index. Shocks to the excess bond premium that are orthogonal to current economic activity, the information contained in the term structure of interest rates, and news embedded in the stock market returns are shown to cause economically and statistically significant declines in consumption, investment, and output. Overall, our findings are consistent with the notion that an increase in the excess bond premium reflects a reduction in the risk appetite of the financial sector and, as a result, a contraction in the supply of credit, which has significant adverse consequences for economic outcomes...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, we analyse market-based {{recovery}} {{rates on}} 78 defaulted high yield bonds in the Nordic market, during the time-period from May 2014 to September 2016. First, we estimate market-based recovery rates, {{defined as the}} average synthetic bond price from the default event date to 90 days after the event. Second, we analyse the bond price development in a time window of 90 days pre-default to 90 days after each individual default event. In general, our results show a decreasing price path throughout the time window with no substantial price reaction at the default event date. In contrast to bankruptcy and non-payment events, we find that distressed exchange events show an increasing price path after the default event. Additionally, we find that secured bonds trade at a stable premium compared to <b>unsecured</b> <b>bonds</b> throughout the time window. Third, we {{determine the effects of}} a comprehensive set of variables on recovery rates. We are able to explain 55. 3 per cent of the cross-sectional variation in recovery rates in our best model. These results reveal that bond characteristics such as outstanding amount and bond covenants are important determinants of the recovery rate. Furthermore, we note interesting economic effects for the net debt/EBITDA measure, a balance sheet ratio motivated by credit risk models. Macroeconomic variables play a lesser role in explaining the variation in recovery rates. Finally, we analyse the liquidity in 42 of the 78 defaulted bonds during the same time window. In general, the average trading volume increases towards a peek at the default event day. Although the amount traded diminishes, trading remains high the following 45 days. After this point, there are virtually no trading activity...|$|R
