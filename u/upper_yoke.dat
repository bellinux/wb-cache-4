40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{research results}} {{referring to the}} development of a non-invasive method of assessment of the power transformer core technical condition based on the analysis of the mechanical vibrations registered. It characterizes the power object under study, the measuring system used and the developed methodology of assessment of the core pressing degree using the vibroacoustic method. The original results of the time–frequency analysis of the vibroacoustic signals presented in the paper were obtained during switching on a real 800 kVA dry type power transformer in laboratory conditions. The analysis of the signals registered was carried out for three states of its operation: the core pressed by the manufacturer, the core with loose screws fixing the <b>upper</b> <b>yoke</b> and the core with separated <b>upper</b> <b>yoke</b> beams.

40|$|For {{practical}} reasons, {{the chimney}} of a cyclotron's internal ion source often has RF grounds at only one end, despite {{the desire for}} an axially symmetric electric field throughout the cyclotron. It is generally impractical or impossible to measure {{the shape of the}} electric fields around the chimney, but one of the authors (H. Blosser of Michigan State University) has observed that in three cyclotrons of similar design built at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, the machine with the least axial oscillation of the beam was the only one designed with median plane symmetry in its RF grounding. Based on this he suggests that RF currents in an asymmetrically grounded chimney give the beam an initial vertical kick which starts a coherent oscillation about the median plane. This hypothesis is being tested in the Ion Beam Applications C 235 proton therapy cyclotron which uses an internal hot-cathode PIG ion source that is normally grounded only at the bottom. The test uses an insert which can be temporarily installed in the <b>upper</b> <b>yoke</b> hole of the cyclotron in order to make an RF grounding connection {{to the top of the}} chimney. A scintillation probe is then used to study the axial beam position on successive turns with and without the symmetric RF grounding. Anglai...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} new method for the {{accurate}} characterization of soft magnetic sheets using a permeameter {{based on the}} precise compensation of the magnetomotive force (MMF) drop in the flux-closing yoke. It has been developed in order to overcome the systematic uncertainty affecting {{the value of the}} magnetic fieldstrength in single sheet testers when obtained, according to the standards, through the measurement of the magnetizing current. This phenomenon is more critical for high permeability materials, because of the reduced MMF drop across the sample. While additional sensors and auxiliary windings have been proposed in the literature, a novel approach is demonstrated here, based {{on the use of the}} permeameter <b>upper</b> half <b>yoke</b> as the MMF drop sensor and of an auxiliary winding on the lower half yoke, implementing compensation. This solution, dispensing one from dealing with the usually small signal levels of the conventional MMF drop sensors (e. g. Chattock coils), provides best results with the introduction of wedge-shaped magnetic poles, in order to accurately define the magnetic path length. The method is validated by measurements of power loss, apparent power, and hysteresis cycles on non-oriented and grain-oriented Fe-Si steel sheets, which are compared with local measurements performed on the same samples using H-coil and B-coil across a uniformly magnetized region...|$|R
40|$|The paper reviews {{a set of}} {{magnetic}} probes which was installed in JET {{in order to improve}} the field measurements in the proximity of the iron, and focuses in particular on one of them. The set consists of six Limb probes, attached to the <b>upper</b> horizontal iron <b>yokes,</b> and one Collar Probe, inserted in the collar region of the iron structure. The probes include pick-up coils, flux loops, Hall sensors, and a temperature sensor. The data provided by the system are regularly acquired and recorded within the set of JET Pulse Files. They can be used in studies implying measurement of the stray field due to the residual magnetization, as well as for all the modeling activities involving 3 D studies, in particular resistive wall mode studies, more accurate modeling for the vertical stabilization, interactions between NBI and magnetic field. In addition, the experience gained with Hall transducers is considered valuable in view of their potential use in ITER. Unlike the limb probes, the collar probe did not pass the functional commissioning, due to an unexpected discrepancy between the signals from Hall sensors and pick-up coils. The analysis illustrated in the paper shows that a critical assessment of the local configuration and a suitable magnetic modeling solve the issue of the observed discordance, by putting it in relation with a local geometrical effect due to the peculiar shape of the ferromagnetic collar teeth. The improvement {{of magnetic}} models targeted to the prediction of signals produced by magnetic sensors is important, also considering {{that a large number of}} magnetic probes in ITER will be located close to the ferromagnetic inserts...|$|R
