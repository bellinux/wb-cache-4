50|$|The {{structure}} of the core of PTEN (solved by X-ray crystallography, see figure to the <b>upper</b> right) <b>reveals</b> that it consists primarily of a phosphatase domain, and a C2 domain: the phosphatase domain contains the active site, which carries out the enzymatic function of the protein, while the C2 domain binds the phospholipid membrane. Thus PTEN binds the membrane through both its phosphatase and C2 domains, bringing the active site to the membrane-bound PIP3 to dephosphorylate it.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To report two differing {{forms of}} upper lid {{migration}} of rigid gas-permeable contact lens and review {{the literature on}} embedded contact lenses. METHODS: Two case reports and review of the literature. RESULTS: Case 1 was a 36 -year-old woman, who presented with a 1 -year history of a left upper lid mass. Eversion of the <b>upper</b> lid <b>revealed</b> a tarsoconjunctival mass with an overlying scar. Excision revealed a migrated contact lens within a cyst of conjunctival epithelium. She recalled she had lost the lens 1 year before noticing the mass. Case 2 was a 42 -year-old woman, who had a 10 -month history of mucopurulent discharge from the right eye. Double eversion of the <b>upper</b> lid <b>revealed</b> an embedded contact lens with pus. Excision demonstrated a lens surrounded by inflamed granulation tissue. She recalled having lost the lens after sleeping overnight with the lens in place approximately 1 year before {{the development of the}} mucopurulent discharge. CONCLUSIONS: These cases highlight the importance of acquiring a detailed history of contact lens loss in patients presenting with upper eyelid masses. Furthermore, the history of lens loss may be remote from commencement of symptoms, which may vary significantly between patients.

40|$|A four-day-old boy {{presented}} with persistent bilious vomiting, bloody stained stool, and mild abdominal distension.

Intestinal malrotation is congenital abnormal positioning of the bowel loops within the peritoneal cavity resulting in abnormal shortening of mesenteric root that is predisposed to midgut volvulus. Neonates and infants with persistent bilious vomiting should undergo diagnostic workup and preferably ultrasound as the first step. With classic sonographic appearance of whirlpool sign, even further imaging investigations is often not needed, and the surgeon should be alerted to plan surgery...|$|R
