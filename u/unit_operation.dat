25|$|A <b>unit</b> <b>operation</b> is a {{physical}} step in an individual chemical engineering process. Unit operations (such as crystallization, filtration, drying and evaporation) are used to prepare reactants, purifying and separating its products, recycling unspent reactants, and controlling energy transfer in reactors. On the other hand, a unit process is the chemical equivalent of a <b>unit</b> <b>operation.</b> Along with unit operations, unit processes constitute a process operation. Unit processes (such as nitration and oxidation) involve the conversion of material by biochemical, thermochemical and other means. Chemical engineers responsible for these are called process engineers.|$|E

40|$|The development, optimization, and {{analysis}} of downstream processes are challenged by {{a high number of}} potentially critical process parameters that need to be investigated using lab-scale experiments. These process parameters are spread across multiple <b>unit</b> <b>operations</b> and potentially show interactions across <b>unit</b> <b>operations.</b> In this contribution, we present a novel strategy for bioprocess development that considers the risk of parameter interactions across <b>unit</b> <b>operations</b> for efficient experimental design. A novel risk assessment tool (interaction matrix) is introduced to the Quality by Design (QbD) workflow. Using this tool, the risk of interaction across <b>unit</b> <b>operations</b> is rated. Subsequently, a design of experiments (DoE) across <b>unit</b> <b>operations</b> is conducted that has the power to reveal multivariate interdependencies. The power of the presented strategy is demonstrated for protein isolation steps of an inclusion body process, focusing on the quality attribute inclusion body purity. The concentration of Triton X- 100 in the course of inclusion body (IB) purification was shown to interact with the g-number of the subsequent centrifugation step. The presented strategy targets a holistic view on the process and allows handling of a high number of experimental parameters across <b>unit</b> <b>operations</b> using minimal experimental effort. It is generically applicable for process development along QbD principles...|$|R

25|$|Distillation is {{the process}} of {{separating}} the components or substances from a liquid mixture by selective evaporation and condensation.

2500|$|Most diesel {{locomotives}} {{are capable of}} multiple <b>unit</b> <b>operation</b> (MU) {{as a means of}} increasing horsepower and tractive effort when hauling heavy trains. All North American locomotives, including export models, use a standardized AAR electrical control system interconnected by a 27-pin jumper cable between the units. For UK-built locomotives, a number of incompatible control systems are used, but the most common is the Blue Star system, which is electro-pneumatic and fitted to most early diesel classes. A small number of types, typically higher-powered locomotives intended for passenger only work, do not have multiple control systems. In all cases, the electrical control connections made common to all units in a consist are referred to as trainlines.

His visits were not always secret and he often moved rapidly from place to place with the Japanese and a pack of spies in close pursuit." [...] He heard of the plans for an uprising against the Japanese and advised that it be postponed until the Allied forces were in a position to advance into Borneo; his advice was not heeded and the Double Tenth rebellion of the night of 9/10 October 1943 in North Borneo under the leadership of Albert Kwok resulted in the deaths of many Japanese.
