5|$|After {{experiencing}} {{chest pains}} following the team's 27–17 {{victory over the}} New Orleans Saints on December 13, Reeves underwent quadruple bypass surgery. The team was coached by defensive coordinator Rich Brooks for the final two regular season games. Reeves was {{able to return to}} the team in time for their first playoff game, in which the Falcons beat their division rival, the San Francisco 49ers, to clinch a spot in the Conference Championship. Despite an impressive season, they were not expected to match <b>up</b> <b>well</b> against the Vikings, who had beaten teams by an average of 23.22 points at home that year and were installed as 11-point favorites for the Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|Both teams {{struggled}} {{to put a}} flowing move together in the opening exchanges, but it was United who had the better chances, both falling to Ronaldo. The first came in the seventhminute: having been played the ball by Michael Carrick, Ronaldo turned away from Piqué {{on the edge of}} the centre circle, before hitting a shot just wide from almost 40yards; the second saw the ball break to Ronaldo after Anderson and Patrice Evra had linked <b>up</b> <b>well</b> down the left flank. The Portuguese winger controlled the ball on the chest before hitting the ball just past the far post.|$|E

5|$|Final Fantasy Collection {{sold over}} 400,000 copies in 1999, {{making it the}} 31st best selling release of that year in Japan. Weekly Famitsu gave it a 54 out of 60 points, scored {{by a panel of}} six reviewers. The Game Boy Advance version, Final Fantasy IV Advance, was met with praise from reviewers, {{although}} a few noted the game's graphics do not hold <b>up</b> <b>well</b> to current games, especially when compared to Final Fantasy VI. Reviewers noted that some fans may still nitpick certain errors in the new translation. The Nintendo DS version of the game was praised for its visuals, gameplay changes and new cutscenes. It was a nominee for Best RPG on the Nintendo DS in IGN's 2008 video game awards.|$|E

The VVKJ's 51st Fighter Group at Zemun had been alerted before dawn, and when reports began to be received about Luftwaffe attacks on VVKJ airfields, the first patrol was sent into the air.

5|$|Mark McGhee {{was named}} as Millwall's new manager in September 2000, and {{eight months later}} the club won {{promotion}} as Division Two champions, with the team built by Keith Stevens, after {{five years in the}} third tier of the league. They finished with 93 points, a club record. Winning the first match of the 2001–02 season 4–0 at home to Norwich City set the team <b>up</b> <b>well</b> for a good year, in which Millwall qualified for the Division One play-offs, but lost to eventual winners Birmingham City 2–1 in the semi-finals. Millwall finished mid-table in the 2002–03 season and McGhee was sacked soon after the start of the 2003–04 season.|$|E

5|$|As a player, Shearer {{was often}} styled {{as a classic}} English centre-forward, owing to his strength, {{physical}} stature, heading ability and strong shot, which enabled him to be highly prolific goalscorer. Of his 206 Newcastle goals, 49 were scored with his head. Earlier in his career, especially at Southampton, Shearer played a more creative role: providing chances for fellow strikers, and making runs into space, owing to his early development as a midfielder. Later on in his career, Shearer played a more forward role, after his age robbed him {{of some of his}} pace. Able to hold the ball <b>up</b> <b>well,</b> he often functioned as a target man, providing balls for other players. Although his strength allowed him {{to hold on to the}} ball, his playing style sometimes brought him criticism – most commonly that his play was too physical, and that he used his elbows too aggressively. It was this which contributed to both of his sendings off, although one was later rescinded on appeal.|$|E
5|$|DST's {{potential}} {{to save energy}} comes primarily from its effects on residential lighting, which consumes about 3.5% of electricity in the United States and Canada. Delaying the nominal time of sunset and sunrise reduces the use of artificial light {{in the evening and}} increases it in the morning. As Franklin's 1784 satire pointed out, lighting costs are reduced if the evening reduction outweighs the morning increase, as in high-latitude summer when most people wake <b>up</b> <b>well</b> after sunrise. An early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of incandescent lighting, once a primary use of electricity. Although energy conservation remains an important goal, energy usage patterns have greatly changed since then, and recent research is limited and reports contradictory results. Electricity use is greatly affected by geography, climate, and economics, making it hard to generalize from single studies.|$|E

5|$|De Grasse had {{detached}} {{a few of}} his {{ships to}} blockade the York and James Rivers farther up the bay, and many of the ships at anchor were missing officers, men, and boats when the British fleet was sighted. He faced the difficult proposition of organizing a line of battle while sailing against an incoming tide, with winds and land features that would require him to do so on a tack opposite that of the British fleet. At 11:30 am, 24 ships of the French fleet cut their anchor lines and began sailing out of the bay with the noon tide, leaving behind the shore contingents and ships' boats. Some ships were so seriously undermanned, missing as many as 200 men, that not all of their guns could be manned. De Grasse had ordered the ships to form into a line as they exited the bay, in order of speed and without regard to its normal sailing order. Admiral Louis de Bougainville's Auguste {{was one of the first}} ships out. With a squadron of three other ships Bougainville ended <b>up</b> <b>well</b> ahead of the rest of the French line; by 3:45 pm the gap was large enough that the British could have cut his squadron off from the rest of the French fleet.|$|E
