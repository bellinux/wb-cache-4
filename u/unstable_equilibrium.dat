40|$|Abstract: In this work, a {{fractional}} {{chaotic system}} is introduced, where the capacitor and the inductor {{of the original}} circuit are replaced by a fractional electric element called fractance. Moreover, a feedback nonlinear controller is designated and used both to control chaos in this fractional system to its <b>unstable</b> (<b>equilibriums</b> or periodic orbits) and to achieve identical synchronization. Furthermore non-identical synchronization is studied to achieve synchronization between two coupled systems with different fractional orders.

25|$|The {{solution}} of Domokos and Várkonyi has curved edges and resembles a sphere with a squashed top. In the top figure, it rests in its stable equilibrium. Its <b>unstable</b> <b>equilibrium</b> position is obtained by rotating the figure 180° about a horizontal axis. Theoretically, it will rest there, but the smallest perturbation will {{bring it back}} to the stable point. The mathematical gömböc has indeed sphere-like properties. In particular its flatness and thinness are minimal, and this is the only type of nondegenerate object with this property. Domokos and Várkonyi are interested to find a polyhedral solution with the surface consisting of a minimal number of flat planes. Therefore, they offer a prize to anyone who finds such solution, which amounts to $10,000 divided by the number of planes in the solution. Obviously, one can approximate their curvilinear gömböc with a finite number of discrete surfaces, however, their estimate is it will take thousands of planes to achieve that. They hope, by offering this prize, to stimulate finding a radically different solution from their own.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Model-free {{control of}} {{unidentified}} systems with <b>unstable</b> <b>equilibriums</b> results in serious problems. In order to surmount these difficulties, firstly an existing model-based controller {{is used as}} a mentor for emotional-learning controller. This learning phase prepares the controller to behave like the mentor, while prevents any instability. Next, the controller is softly switched from model based to emotional one, using a FIS 1. Also the emotional stress is softly switched from the mentor-imitator output difference to the combination of objectives generated by a FIS which attentionally modulated stresses. For evaluating the proposed model free controller, a laboratorial inverted pendulum 2 is employed.

2500|$|The {{rigorous}} {{proof of}} the solution {{can be found in}} references of their work. The summary of the results is that the three-dimensional homogeneous convex (mono-monostatic) body, which has one stable and one <b>unstable</b> <b>equilibrium</b> point, does exist and is not unique. Such bodies are hard to visualize, describe or identify. Their form is dissimilar to any typical representative of any other equilibrium geometrical class. They should have minimal [...] "flatness", and, to avoid having two unstable equilibria, must also have minimal [...] "thinness". They are the only non-degenerate objects having simultaneously minimal flatness and thinness. The shape of those bodies is very sensitive to small variation, outside which it is no longer mono-monostatic. For example, the first solution of Domokos and Várkonyi closely resembled a sphere, with a shape deviation of only 10−5. It was dismissed, as it was extremely hard to test experimentally. Their published solution was less sensitive; yet it has a shape tolerance of 10−3, that is 0.1mm for a 10cm size.|$|E
2500|$|The {{theory of}} the {{behavior}} of columns was investigated in 1757 by mathematician Leonhard Euler. He derived the formula, the Euler formula, that gives the maximum axial load that a long, slender, ideal column can carry without buckling. An ideal column is one that is perfectly straight, made of a homogeneous material, and free from initial stress. When the applied load reaches the Euler load, sometimes called the critical load, the column comes to be in a state of <b>unstable</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> At that load, the introduction of the slightest lateral force will cause the column to fail by suddenly [...] "jumping" [...] to a new configuration, and the column is said to have buckled. This is what happens when a person stands on an empty aluminum can and then taps the sides briefly, causing it to then become instantly crushed (the vertical sides of the can understood as an infinite series of extremely thin columns). The formula derived by Euler for long slender columns is given below.|$|E

30|$|Because R_ 0 is {{independent}} on the parameters δ and η, they cannot change {{the stability of}} the trivial equilibrium. Thus, we then let b be a bifurcation parameter and fix δ = 2 and η = 0.01, Figs.  3 (D)–(F) show that system (1) first undergoes a forward bifurcation at b= 1.25 with the trivial equilibrium losing its stability and a stable predator-extinction equilibrium emerging. When b continues increases to 43.56, a saddle-node bifurcation occurs and then there exist an <b>unstable</b> positive <b>equilibrium</b> and a stable positive equilibrium (which is bistable with the predator-extinction equilibrium). Then, system (1) undergoes a backward bifurcation (transcritical bifurcation) at b= 68.2, here, the predator-extinction equilibrium loses its stability while the <b>unstable</b> positive <b>equilibrium</b> disappears. As we can see from Figs.  3 (D)–(F), increasing b can increase the population of the prey. However, different from the anti-predator behavior, increase the birth rate of the prey can also increase the population of the predator.|$|R
