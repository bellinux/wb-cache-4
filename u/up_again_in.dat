5|$|When Johnny Carson, {{a fan of}} jazz music, was {{preparing}} to take over as the permanent host of The Tonight Show starting in October 1962, he recognized that he would need a theme song. Carson and Anka had worked together in England on the television special An Evening with Paul Anka in 1961; when they happened to meet <b>up</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> New York City the following year, Carson manager Al Bruno mentioned needing a theme.|$|E
5|$|When {{a player}} reaches exactly 31 points, he must {{announce}} this feat to all participants {{before the next}} player shoots a shot {{in order to be}} victorious. If this is not done, the player may not again invoke his winning score until his turn comes <b>up</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> rotation. If another player in the interim successfully scores exactly 31, and properly announces it, that player wins the game.|$|E

5|$|According to Constantine VII, the Slavs rose <b>up</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> {{the early}} 840s, but were {{defeated}} by strategos Theoktistos Bryennios. In the south, the two tribes of the Ezeritai and Melingoi held out longer. They were eventually subdued {{and forced to}} pay heavy tribute, but retained their autonomy. These two tribes rose up again a century later, in 921. Again they were quickly subdued, this time by the strategos Krenites Arotras, but managed to remain autonomous and retain their distinct identity until well into Frankish times.|$|E
5|$|Mining ceased in Ny-Ålesund in 1929; it {{was taken}} <b>up</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> 1941, {{but because of the}} Second World War the town was {{evacuated}} the following year. From 1946, the Royal Norwegian Air Force started serving Ny-Ålesund with their Consolidated PBY Catalina amphibian aircraft. The aircraft were able to land if there was no ice on the fjord and lighting and weather permitted it. The first flight took place on 10 May and consisted of post drops. No further flights were carried out until 1949; one of the flights that year was an air ambulance operation. The service also dropped post at the other Norwegian settlements in Svalbard. In 1961, the Catalinas were replaced with Grumman HU-16B Albatross aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Prices for pelts {{have varied}} {{considerably}} {{over the past}} 100 years. They were highest in the 1920s and 1930s, when average prices were about $100 US. In 1936, pelts were being offered for sale in New York City for $450–750 per pelt. Prices declined through the 1960s but picked <b>up</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> the late 1970s. In 1979, the Hudson's Bay Company paid $410 for one female pelt. In 1999, 16,638 pelts were sold in Canada for $449,307 (CAN) at an average price of $27.|$|E

5|$|Sandgate was {{intended}} to defend a vulnerable point along the Kent cliffs, just west of Folkestone, where an enemy force could potentially land and make their way easily further inland. Sandgate's construction was supervised by the Moravian engineer Stefan von Haschenperg, and Thomas Cockys and Richard Keys acted as commissioners for the project. In {{the initial stages of}} the work in 1539, a team of 237 men were employed, with masons, quarrymen, limeburners and wood fellers preparing the site; the masons were drawn {{from as far away as}} Somerset and Gloucestershire. By the summer, over 500 were at work, including labourers, bricklayers, carpenters and sawyers. After a pause during the winter months, work picked <b>up</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> the summer of the next year, with 630 working on the castle that July.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill passed}} the Hawaii House of Representatives in February 2009 {{in a form}} {{specific}} to same-sex couples, was passed in amended form including opposite-sex couples by the Hawaii Senate in May 2009, and was carried over in the 2010 session, where it passed the Senate again in January 2010 with a veto-proof majority. The bill {{moved back to the}} House but was indefinitely postponed by a voice vote initiated by House Speaker Calvin Say, requiring a vote of two-thirds of Representatives to be taken <b>up</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> 2010, and was considered dead. In April 2010, {{on the last day of}} the legislative session, the House suspended the rules on the Senate bill and passed it with a majority, sending the bill to Governor Linda Lingle, who vetoed it in July 2010.|$|E
5|$|The main upland {{areas are}} the Mendip Hills in the {{northeast}} and the Quantock Hills further west. The Mendips run west to east between Frome and Weston-super-Mare, overlooking the Somerset Levels to the south and the Chew Valley and other tributaries of the River Avon to the north. They culminate in the promontory of Brean Down, only to crop <b>up</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> the Bristol Channel as the islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm. Steep Holm is part of Somerset while Flat Holm is the most southerly point of Wales. The Mendips are composed of Carboniferous Limestone and water erosion has created gorges, dry valleys, screes, swallets and caves as well as various karst features.|$|E
50|$|The {{relocation}} of the railway was finally brought <b>up</b> <b>again</b> and <b>in</b> 1925 three alternative designs for a road-rail bridge were produced, with a street bridge passing alternatively to the east, to the west, {{or above the}} railway.|$|R

50|$|Another year of {{experience}} for {{the new generation of}} Rebels provided a keen edge to the team, an edge which propelled the team to a perfect 8-0 regular season record. With both their offence and defence statistically being the best in the league throughout the season the tempo was <b>upped</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> the semi-final versus the West Dublin Rhinos. The Rebels rolled to a comfortable 65-0 victory, racking up ten touchdowns on the way. This victory set up a meeting in Shamrock Bowl XXIV with the rival Vikings.|$|R
5|$|Astraeus hygrometricus, {{commonly}} known as the hygroscopic earthstar, the barometer earthstar, or the false earthstar, is a species of fungus in the family Diplocystaceae. Young specimens resemble a puffball when unopened. In maturity, the mushroom displays the characteristic earthstar shape that {{is a result of the}} outer layer of fruit body tissue splitting open in a star-like manner. The false earthstar is an ectomycorrhizal species that grows in association with various trees, especially in sandy soils. A.hygrometricus has a cosmopolitan distribution, and is common in temperate and tropical regions. Its common names refer to the fact that it is hygroscopic (water-absorbing), and can open up its rays to expose the spore sac in response to increased humidity, and close them <b>up</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> drier conditions. The rays have an irregularly cracked surface, while the spore case is pale brown and smooth with an irregular slit or tear at the top. The gleba is white initially, but turns brown and powdery when the spores mature. The spores are reddish-brown, roughly spherical with minute warts, measuring 7.5–11 micrometers in diameter.|$|E
5|$|During Troglita's {{absence from}} Africa, the {{situation}} had been turbulent. Germanus had remained in the province until 539, and succeeded in restoring discipline {{in the army and}} pacifying the core territories of Africa Proconsularis and Byzacena. He was succeeded by Solomon, who began his second tenure with great success, defeating the Moors of the Aurès Mountains and establishing control over Numidia and Mauretania Sitifensis. However, the Moorish revolt flared <b>up</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> 543 and Solomon was killed in the Battle of Cillium in 544. His successor, his nephew Sergius, was incompetent. He was defeated by the Moors, recalled and replaced with the senator Areobindus, who was murdered in spring 546 in another military revolt led by the general Guntharic. The latter intended to declare himself independent of Constantinople, but was soon murdered by the Armenian Artabanes. The need for a new and capable leader in Africa was apparent to Constantinople. After a truce was signed with Persia in 546, Emperor Justinian, perhaps, as Corippus implies, acting on Urbicius's advice, recalled Troglita from the East. After having him report on the situation there in Constantinople, the Emperor placed him {{at the head of a}} new army and sent him to Africa as the new magister militum per Africam in late summer 546.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea was}} taken <b>up</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> {{the search for}} solar neutrinos. Theoretically, the Sun {{produced}} neutrinos {{in the course of}} nuclear fusion reactions. Pontecorvo credited Maurice Pryce for this idea. The most common, the proton–proton chain reaction in which hydrogen is fused to form helium produces neutrinos that are not energetic enough to interact with chlorine. However, the much less common CNO cycle that produces carbon, nitrogen and oxygen does. In the late 1960s, Ray Davis and John N. Bahcall detected solar neutrinos in the Homestake Experiment, for which Davis was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2002. The experiment was the first to successfully detect and count solar neutrinos, but the number of neutrinos detected was between one third and one half of the predicted number. This became the solar neutrino problem. For a time scientists contemplated the awful possibility that the Sun might have burned out.|$|E
5000|$|Of note is what Galadriel said to Treebeard {{at their}} parting in Isengard, [...] "Not in Middle-earth, nor until the lands that lie under the wave are lifted <b>up</b> <b>again.</b> Then <b>in</b> the willow-meads of Tasarinan we may {{meet in the}} spring. Farewell!" [...] This seems to imply that Beleriand may be {{existent}} <b>again,</b> <b>in</b> Arda Healed.|$|R

5|$|At {{the same}} time {{resistance}} flared <b>up</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> western Mercia, where the forces of Eadric the Wild, together with his Welsh allies and further rebel forces from Cheshire and Shropshire, attacked the castle at Shrewsbury. In the south-west, rebels from Devon and Cornwall attacked the Norman garrison at Exeter, but were repulsed by the defenders and scattered by a Norman relief force under Count Brian. Other rebels from Dorset, Somerset and neighbouring areas besieged Montacute Castle but were defeated by a Norman army gathered from London, Winchester and Salisbury under Geoffrey of Coutances. Meanwhile, William attacked the Danes, who had moored for the winter south of the Humber in Lincolnshire, and drove {{them back to the}} north bank. Leaving Robert of Mortain in charge of Lincolnshire, he turned west and defeated the Mercian rebels in battle at Stafford. When the Danes attempted to return to Lincolnshire, the Norman forces there again drove them back across the Humber. William advanced into Northumbria, defeating an attempt to block his crossing of the swollen River Aire at Pontefract. The Danes fled at his approach, and he occupied York. He bought off the Danes, who agreed to leave England in the spring, and during the winter of 1069–70 his forces systematically devastated Northumbria in the Harrying of the North, subduing all resistance. As a symbol of his renewed authority over the north, William ceremonially wore his crown at York on Christmas Day 1069.|$|E
5|$|The subject came <b>up</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> 1930, {{during the}} Conference on Codification of International Law, held in The Hague. A strong {{contingent}} {{of women from}} America joined international women's groups to change the existing nationality laws, but the women were unable to agree on wording. Intense lobbying by women, and a massive parade demonstration, failed to influence the conferees, and the international law continued to hold that a woman's nationality followed her husband's. In response, Macmillan organised an International Committee for Action on the Nationality of Married Women early the next year. Six {{of the most influential}} international women's groups sought a broad base of support from working women. Macmillan's stated goal was to delay ratification of the Hague Convention, and to make certain that a woman's nationality would not change without her consent, and that the nationality of a couple's children would not be more influenced by the father's nationality. The new committee was successful in lobbying the League of Nations to address the problem, but when the League constituted a study group, that group was split between two intractable factions. On one side were those who wanted a married couple to have exactly one nationality, based on that of the husband, {{and on the other side}} were those like Macmillan who favoured independent citizenship between spouses, with the possibility of wives having different citizenship than their husbands, and children to be allowed dual citizenship. In 1932, the women's group, at an impasse, were pushed aside as ineffectual by the League of Nations, who decided in favour of ratifying the Hague Convention. The women's group disbanded, and the Hague convention was ratified in 1937.|$|E
5|$|Whether {{slavery was}} to be {{regulated}} under the new Constitution {{was a matter of}} such intense conflict between the North and South that several Southern states refused to join the Union if slavery were not to be allowed. Delegates opposed to slavery were forced to yield in their demands that slavery practiced {{within the confines of the}} new nation be completely outlawed. However, they continued to argue that the Constitution should prohibit the states from participating in the international slave trade, including in the importation of new slaves from Africa and the export of slaves to other countries. The Convention postponed making a final decision on the international slave trade until late in the deliberations because of the contentious nature of the issue. During the Convention's late July recess, the Committee of Detail had inserted language that would prohibit the federal government from attempting to ban international slave trading and from imposing taxes on the purchase or sale of slaves. The Convention could not agree on these provisions when the subject came <b>up</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> late August, so they referred the matter to an eleven-member committee for further discussion. This committee helped work out a compromise: Congress would have the power to ban the international slave trade, but not for another twenty years (that is, not until 1808). In exchange for this concession, the federal government's power to regulate foreign commerce would be strengthened by provisions that allowed for taxation of slave trades in the international market and that reduced the requirement for passage of navigation acts from two-thirds majorities of both houses of Congress to simple majorities.|$|E
