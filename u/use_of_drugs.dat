5|$|Concerning drugs, Paul {{has criticized}} {{mandatory}} minimums {{that he believes}} have led to unreasonably harsh sentences for repeat offenders. He has highlighted the case of Timothy L. Tyler as particularly unfair. Paul {{does not believe in}} legalizing the recreational <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> like marijuana and cocaine, but does not support jailing marijuana users. He supports state laws to legalize the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Paul was one of three U.S. senators in 2015 to introduce a bipartisan bill, CARERS, that would legalize medical marijuana under federal law.|$|E
5|$|In some {{countries}} bathhouses {{are prohibited from}} selling alcohol. (In Canada, where some bathhouses serve alcohol, a bathhouse holding a liquor license {{may be required to}} submit to liquor inspections, which activists claim are often a pretext for regulating gay sexual activity.) Many bathhouses deny entry to those who are visibly intoxicated but do notor cannotregulate the consumption of drugs (typically marijuana, poppers, ecstasy, cocaine, and crystal meth) by their patrons. The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> and alcohol may make people {{more likely to engage in}} unsafe sex. Sex clubs with no private areas potentially find it easier to regulate consumption of drugs on their premises.|$|E
5|$|The {{effort of}} the High Court {{challenge}} and the Olympic ban took its toll on Chambers, {{but he had no}} intention to retire and set an appearance in the 2012 London Olympics as his main goal, aiming to prove he could perform without the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs.</b> Lord Moynihan objected to this, saying it would sully the reputation of both the Great Britain athletics team and the London Olympics. In late 2008 Chambers signed a book deal, covering his athletics career and drug usage, and stated his desire to become a sprint coach when his track career was finished. He had his second child, a boy named Rocco, that November.|$|E
40|$|Asthma is {{a public}} health problem in almost all {{countries}} in the world. Potential drug related problems (DRPs) contribute to morbidity and mortality in asthmatic atients. This study aims to determine the incidence <b>of</b> <b>Drug</b> Related Problems (DRPs) with category <b>of</b> wrong <b>drug</b> selection that includes the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> ineffective <b>drugs,</b> the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> unsafe <b>drugs,</b> and the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> combination that are not necessary in asthmatic patients in Dr. Moewardi Surakarta Hospital in 2015. This research was conducted with non-experimental descriptive design and data acquisition retrospectively for medical record data. Samples were collected with purposive sampling method. The patient’s criteria as subject {{in this study were}} diagnosed with asthma, receive asthma medication, receive more than 2 medications, and have complete medical data record. Samples were analyzed to identify drug interactions based on the literature Stockley's Drug Interaction 2008 and drug interaction checker (www. drugs. com and www. medscape. com). Global initiative for asthma 2011 and Drug Information Handbook 2009 are used to identify wrong drug selection. The data were analyzed descriptively. Out of the 59 samples, the result showed there were 40 patients (67. 79 %) with wrong drug selection that includes 2 cases (2, 59 %) were the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> ineffective <b>drugs,</b> 61 cases (82, 44 %) were the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> unsafe <b>drugs,</b> and 11 cases (14, 86 %) were the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> combination that are not necessary.

5|$|Le Guin was {{strongly}} opposed to and {{troubled by the}} Vietnam War, a reaction which played a large part {{in the tone of}} the novel. The tone of the novel is often harsh and hard-hitting, playing off the anger in the United States at American military actions in Vietnam. The tension between violence and non-violence {{is a part of the}} dialectic theme in the novel, of a constant tension between opposites. Through most of the novel, the Terran military is in control of the colony, despite Raj Lyubov's good intentions. Davidson is the most prominent example of the oppressiveness of the military government. There are intentional parallels drawn between the Terran colonizers and the US intervention in Vietnam; the anti-interventionist tone of the novel was in sharp contrast to other science-fiction novels about war written around the same period. For example, the high <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> amongst US troops in Vietnam is represented by the use of hallucinogens amongst the Terran soldiers, which Le Guin portrays as the norm on the colony.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{competed in}} all three sports in 2006. In bobsleigh, Australia competed in the two-man and two-woman events, and was the highest-placed country to miss {{qualifications}} for an Olympic berth in the four-man event at the 2006 Challenge Cup. The Australian Olympic Committee unsuccessfully tried to have the Brazilian bobsleigh team thrown out due to the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> by Armando dos Santos, so that Australia would take its place. Hannah Campbell-Pegg came 23rd in luge, and Michelle Steele, a beach flag sprinter chosen from a systematic program to identify a potential skeleton medal-winner from female non-winter athletes, came 13th due to inexperience with the intimidating and technical track. Shaun Boyle represented Australia in the men's skeleton and placed 22nd. In 2010, Australia were represented in every bobsled event, but all finished last, failed to finish due to crashes or had to withdraw due to injuries sustained in earlier races. Australia's sole luger and two male skeleton racers came in the bottom 20%, while Emma Lincoln-Smith and Melissa Hoar came 10th and 12th respectively. Until 2010, Australia had placed in {{the bottom half of}} the field in every sliding event it has entered, and came last in the luge in 1994. Lincoln-Smith's effort in the skeleton in 2010 changed this record.|$|E
5|$|The group {{intentionally}} avoids {{any area}} where crime rates {{could result in}} frequent law enforcement interventions and commandos are instructed to be polite and are warned {{to stay away from}} illegal activities; association or deals with criminal organizations are prohibited. In keeping a discipline code, the organization also discourages the use of alcohol and prohibits the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs.</b> The EPB attempts to stay away from areas where other nationalist groups are based in order to avoid attention. There also settle away from military of police stations. Meetings are generally held in places with good reputation and in buildings that offer several access points, with heavy precautions being taken to reach their locations untailed. If different units are meeting, commandoes are instructed to place hoods or masks and use codenames in order to protect their identities, both to accomplish plausible denial and to root out any law enforcement plant. Information is segregated between groups and only shared in limited detail, when necessary. Incriminating or detailed documents or any other evidence is to be destroyed once the potential of a law enforcement intervention is apparent. While involved in a particular mission, the EPB commandoes regularly assume a faux name, but they usually use this to acquire legitimate documents and select a nondescript address in which to receive mail in a fashion that prevents surveillance, such a P.O. Box or an decoy address where mail is delivered to the community in general. Even ammunitions were given codes such as Manteca for firearms or Libretas for explosives to conceal their nature. Armories were specifically retrofitted to preserve the condition and to prepare new ammunition as needed. Funds are managed strictly and reports are constant in order to keep a balanced budget.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that the {{long-term}} <b>use</b> <b>of</b> antiepileptic <b>drugs</b> can cause nervous system damage. However, short-term antiepileptic drug treatment is frequently given to infants, especially neonates, to control seizure. Whether the short-term <b>use</b> <b>of</b> antiepileptic <b>drugs</b> is neurotoxic remains unclear. In the present study, immature rats, 3 - 21 days of age, were intraperitoneally injected with phenobarbital and/or topiramate for 3 consecutive days. Hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemical staining revealed that phenobarbital and topiramate, individually or in combination, were cytotoxic to hippocampal CA 1 neurons and inhibited the expression of GluR 1 and NR 2 B, excitatory glutamate receptor subunits. Furthermore, the combination <b>of</b> the two <b>drugs</b> caused greater damage than either drug alone. The results demonstrate that the short-term <b>use</b> <b>of</b> antiepileptic <b>drugs</b> damages neurons in the immature brain and that the combined <b>use</b> <b>of</b> antiepileptic <b>drugs</b> exacerbates damage. Our findings suggest that clinicians should consider the potential neurotoxic risk associated with the combined <b>use</b> <b>of</b> antiepileptic <b>drugs</b> in the treatment of seizure...|$|R

25|$|Defibrillation is the {{definitive}} treatment of ventricular fibrillation, whereby an electrical current {{is applied to}} the ventricular mass either directly or externally through pads or paddles, with the aim of depolarising enough of the myocardium for co-ordinated contractions to occur again. The use of this is often dictated around the world by Advanced Cardiac Life Support or Advanced Life Support algorithms, which is taught to medical practitioners including doctors, nurses and paramedics and also advocates the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs,</b> predominantly epinephrine, after every second unsuccessful attempt at defibrillation, as well as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in between defibrillation attempts. Though ALS/ACLS algorithms encourage the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs,</b> they state first and foremost that defibrillation should not be delayed for any other intervention and that adequate cardiopulmonary resuscitation be delivered with minimal interruption.|$|E
