5|$|Chopin's polonaises show {{a marked}} advance on {{those of his}} Polish {{predecessors}} in the form (who included his teachers Zywny and Elsner). As with the traditional polonaise, Chopin's works are in triple time and typically display a martial rhythm in their melodies, accompaniments and cadences. <b>Unlike</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> their precursors, they also require a formidable playing technique.|$|E
5|$|Æthelric was consecrated {{bishop in}} 1058 by Stigand, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Æthelric was consecrated by Stigand, <b>unlike</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the English bishops {{of the time}} period, because at that point, Stigand held a valid pallium, or symbol of an archbishop's {{authority}} and ability to consecrate bishops.|$|E

5|$|A 2008 paper saw {{a return}} to white-eye {{taxonomy}} with the formal description of the Togian white-eye Zosterops somadikartai, an endemic species of the Togian Islands of Indonesia, which, <b>unlike</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> its relatives, lacks the white ring around the eye which give this group of birds its name. Rasmussen noted that the Togian white-eye is distinctive not only in its appearance, but also in its lilting song, which sounds higher pitched and is less varied in frequency than the songs of its close relatives.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, The CIBC Metropolitan Economic Activity Index rated Winnipeg's {{economy as}} fourth in a {{national}} survey of 25 city economies, behind Toronto, Calgary, and Regina. According to the Conference Board of Canada, Winnipeg is projected to experience a real GDP growth of 2 percent in 2014. <b>Unlike</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> Canada, the city experienced a decrease in unemployment in 2013, ending the year at a rate of 5.8 percent. As of 2010, median household income in the city was $72,050.|$|E
5|$|König was interned, {{along with}} the {{majority}} of the High Seas Fleet, in Scapa Flow in November 1918 following the Armistice. On 21 June 1919, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter gave the order to scuttle the fleet, including König, while the British guard ships were out of the harbor on exercises. <b>Unlike</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the scuttled ships, König was never raised for scrapping; the wreck is still {{on the bottom of the}} bay.|$|E

5|$|Thirty Flights of Loving {{includes}} {{references and}} Easter eggs, as did Gravity Bone. Films such as Three Days of the Condor and The Conversation, film directors Steven Soderbergh and Quentin Tarantino, games such as Zork and , and animated shows like Animaniacs and TaleSpin are referenced in the campaign. <b>Unlike</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> Chung's previous games, Thirty Flights of Loving was not framed around a certain musical composition. It incorporates music composed by Idle Thumbs member Chris Remo, while additional audio {{was provided by}} Jared Emerson-Johnson and A.J. Locascio. It makes use of Soundsnap's sound library.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> Dunedin, {{which was}} settled by Scots, many early {{settlers}} in Caversham were English. This {{led to some}} degree of antagonism by the councils {{of the city and}} Caversham borough {{in the early days of}} settlement; Dunedin had been settled by the Presbyterian church, whereas Caversham's population was largely Anglican, Methodist, and Baptist. There is little evidence of this distinction in modern Caversham, other than the origins of local street names, several of which reflect the names of English counties and early English settlers.|$|E
50|$|The film {{does not}} feature a laugh track <b>unlike</b> <b>most</b> episodes <b>of</b> the show but {{similarly}} to several other one-off specials which were made.|$|R
50|$|Very {{little of}} this episode {{actually}} takes place on Wisteria Lane. Many scenes were shot at different locations, <b>unlike</b> <b>most</b> episodes <b>of</b> the series.|$|R
50|$|Iaai has {{an unusual}} voicing {{distinction}} in its sonorants, {{as well as}} several coronal series. <b>Unlike</b> <b>most</b> languages <b>of</b> New Caledonia, voiced stops are not prenasalized.|$|R
5|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> Fagen's {{previous}} work, The Nightfly {{is almost}} blatantly autobiographical. Many {{of the songs}} relate to the cautiously optimistic mood of his suburban childhood in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and incorporate such topics as late-night jazz disc jockeys, fallout shelters, and tropical vacations. Recorded over eight months at various studios between New York City and Los Angeles, the album is an early example of a fully digital recording in popular music. The nascent technology, {{as well as the}} perfectionist nature of its engineers and musicians, made the album difficult to record.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> his contemporaries, Mani Ratnam did not assist {{anybody in}} film-making prior to {{entering}} the industry. He {{is credited with}} revolutionizing the Tamil film industry and is referred for bringing new dimension to the South Asian cinema. A majority of his films are characterized by a string of socio-political themes. Because of his idea of combining art and commercial elements, most of his films garnered both critical acclaim and commercial success. Nayagan, Bombay and Iruvar were inspired from real-life incidents, while Thalapathi and Raavan were based on Indian epics.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> {{the larger}} Orkney islands, the {{derivation}} {{of the name}} 'Shapinsay' is not obvious. The final 'ay' is from the Old Norse for island, but the first two syllables {{are more difficult to}} interpret. Haswell-Smith (2004) suggests the root may be hjalpandis-øy (helpful island) owing to the presence of a good harbour, although anchorages are plentiful in the archipelago. The first written record dates from 1375 in a reference to Scalpandisay, which may suggest a derivation from Judge's island. Another suggestion is Hyalpandi's island, although no one of that name is known to be associated with Shapinsay.|$|E

5|$|After Germany's {{defeat in}} {{the war and the}} signing of the Armistice in November 1918, Kronprinz and most of the capital ships of the High Seas Fleet were interned by the Royal Navy in Scapa Flow. The ships were {{disarmed}} and reduced to skeleton crews while the Allied powers negotiated {{the final version of the}} Treaty of Versailles. On 21 June 1919, days before the treaty was signed, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, ordered the fleet to be scuttled to ensure that the British would not be able to seize the ships. <b>Unlike</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the other scuttled ships, Kronprinz was never raised for scrapping; the wreck is still on the bottom of the harbour.|$|E
5|$|Although Bax won a Macfarren Scholarship for {{composition}} {{and other important}} prizes, and {{was known for his}} exceptional ability to read complex modern scores on sight, he attracted less recognition than his contemporaries Benjamin Dale and York Bowen. His keyboard technique was formidable, but he had no desire for a career as a soloist. <b>Unlike</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> his contemporaries, he had private means that made him free to pursue his musical career as he chose, without the necessity of earning an income. The Times considered that Bax's independence and disinclination to heed his teachers ultimately damaged his art, because he did not develop the discipline to express his imagination to the greatest effect.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{designed}} as a minelayer, the German Navy never operated her as such. She and her sister were used to raid a British convoy to Norway in October 1917. The two cruisers sank two escorting destroyers and nine of the twelve merchant ships of the convoy. The Kaiserliche Marine considered sending the two ships to attack convoys in the Atlantic Ocean, but the difficulties associated with refueling at sea convinced the Germans to abandon the plan. Brummer {{was included in the}} list of ships interned at Scapa Flow following the Armistice. On 21 June 1919, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, ordered the scuttling of the fleet. Brummer was successfully scuttled, and <b>unlike</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the other wrecks, she was never raised for scrapping.|$|E
50|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>most</b> parts <b>of</b> North Brabant the Land of Altena has {{a strong}} Protestant (Calvinist) character. Former Prime Minister Hendrikus Colijn (1869-1944) had his roots in this region.|$|R
50|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>most</b> {{institutions}} <b>of</b> {{higher learning}} on Jeju island, the college campus {{is located in}} a relatively rural area, Bukjeju County. About 66 instructors are employed on the campus.|$|R
