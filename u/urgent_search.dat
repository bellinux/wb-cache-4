Therefore, it’s even more <b>urgent</b> to <b>search</b> for new chemotherapeutic drugs. The aim of this project is to investigate the mechanism of perillyl alcohol (POH), an old chemotherapeutic agent, which has been recently used as intra-nasal inhalation in malignant glioma treatment. In this thesis, I document that POH alone, and combined with Dimethyl-celecoxib (DMC), shows significant anti-tumor activity in-vitro and triggers the induction of Glucose Related Protein 78 (GRP 78), an anti-apoptotic protein that is elevated to deal with stress response. In addition, I also show induction of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein, or (CHOP), a pro-apoptotic protein signal for apoptosis, under the same treatments. These findings imply that POH alone generates Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and forces the tumor cells to enter apoptosis, and when combined with DMC the effect is synergistic. This is particularly exciting {{due to the fact}} that POH can enter the brain via nasal inhalation and thus providing the patients with an effective and yet non-invasive treatment...|$|R

50|$|The {{decision}} to settle Norfolk Island was taken under the impetus of the shock Britain had just received from Empress Catherine II of Russia. Practically all the {{hemp and flax}} required by the Royal Navy for cordage and sailcloth was imported from the Russian dominions through the ports of St. Petersburg (Kronstadt) and Riga. Comptroller of the Navy Sir Charles Middleton explained to Prime Minister Pitt in a letter of 5 September 1786: “It is for Hemp only we are dependent on Russia. Masts can be procured from Nova Scotia, and Iron in plenty from the Ores of this Country; but as it is impracticable {{to carry on a}} Naval War without Hemp, it is materially necessary to promote the growth of it in this Country and Ireland”. In the summer of 1786, the Empress Catherine, in the context of tense negotiations on a renewed treaty of commerce, had emphasised her control over this vital commodity by asking the merchants who supplied it to restrict sales to English buyers: “the Empress has contrary to Custom speculated on this Commodity”, complained the author of a subsequent memorandum to the Home Secretary. “It is unnecessary”, said the memorandum, “to remark the Consequences which might result from a prohibition of supply from that Quarter altogether”. This implicit threat to the viability of the Royal Navy became apparent in mid-September (a month after the decision had been taken to settle Botany Bay) and caused the Pitt Administration to begin an <b>urgent</b> <b>search</b> for new sources of supply, including from Norfolk Island, which was then added to the plan to colonise New South Wales.|$|E

Therefore, it is <b>urgent</b> to <b>search</b> the methods allowing {{the acquisition of}} nanosystems with high storage stability. Silver colloids stabilized by polymers in various solvents are extensively investigated by considering the linear and star-shaped polymers, polymer brushes, block copolymers, and even dendrimers [13 – 19]. However, the advantages of branched polymer matrices in comparison with their linear polymer analogs for in situ nanoparticles formation are still not clear. Yet, this knowledge is needed to prove or disprove the necessity of using expensive materials. The chemical nature of the polymer matrices, {{the nature of the}} reductant, and temperature affect the shape {{and the size of the}} particles [20 – 25]. The internal structure of the polymers could also influence the process of nanoparticle formation. The branched polymer architecture demonstrates an improvement in the ordering phenomenon. That is why such systems can differ in functionalities from their linear analogs. In the present paper, we have focused on the study of Ag sols synthesized in situ in linear and branched polyelectrolyte polymer matrices. The effect of reductant and temperature was discussed too.|$|R

The widespread of resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to the current antimalarial drugs makes <b>urgent</b> the <b>search</b> and discovery of new targets and new drugs. A potential target for the development of new antimalarial drugs is deoxyuridine triphosphatase (dUTPase), and it has been validated for other organisms such as Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Mycobacterium smegmatis. This enzyme plays an important role in maintaining the balance between 2 '-deoxyuridine 5 '-triphosphate (dUTP) and 2 '-deoxythymidine 5 '-triphosphate (dTTP), in order to avoid the erroneous incorporation uracil in the DNA tape. In this study, we developed robust conformation-independent fragment-based quantitative structure–activity (QSAR) and structure– selectivity relationship (QSSR) models for a series of β-branched acyclic nucleotides inhibitors of Plasmodium and human dUTPase, aiming to design new antimalarial agents. The Hologram QSAR and QSSR models generated showed good robustness and external predictability, and is capable of predict affinity and selectivity of untested compounds inside the applicability domain. Therefore, the generated models can be used in virtual screening campaigns in the search of new potent and selective PfdUTPase inhibitors...|$|R
