40|$|The {{knowledge}} about the transient behavior of the boundary layer is quite necessary to achieve an effective cooling of turbine rotor blades that are highly stressed both mechanically and thermally. In this work, experiments were carried out for a single stage research turbine with cooled guide vanes. Flows at the leading edges of rotor blades were measured to get detailed information about the aerodynamics. Varied in the exerpiments were the main parameters such as the rotor load and the massflow of cooling gas from {{the trailing edge of}} the <b>upstream</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vanes.</b> The temperature of cooling gas and hot gas massflow are nearly equal. Four hot-film probes were placed on the leading edge region of the rotor blades to see the fluctuation of the stagnation point. Numerical investigations were also performed along with experiments to clarify the flows in the leading edge region. The results shows {{that in the case of}} zero coolant flow from guide vanes, the turbulence becomes intensified by increasing offdesigne blade load. Regions with high turbulence intensity were detected on the suction side since the flow direction was turned to the pressure side. This leads to a higher heat flow and thus to a higher possibility of 'hot-spots'. Measurements with non-zero cooling gas flow show higher turbulence intensity than those without coolant flux. The ejected coolant mass flow can not be detected by the voltage signals of the hot-film. It can be seen only in the different frequency spectra of hot-film signals. (orig.)

40|$|Erosion of gas {{turbines}} operating in sandy or dusty environments {{can result in}} serious damage to the engine components, particularly the compressor unit. This phenomenon {{is a result of}} the ingestion of the sand particles into the engine and their consequent abrasive impacts on the blade surfaces. In order to understand the mechanism of sand ingestion and the resulting performance degradation, a general methodology has been developed for predicting the trajectories of particles, the erosion rates and blade profile changes, with predictive capabilities for performance degradations within more general configurations of turbomachines. This methodology was applied to an axial fan with <b>upstream</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> (contra whirl) and was supported by experimental results. The numerical models for calculating the particle trajectory are based on the Lagrangian tracking technique and the eddy lifetime concept. The turbulence effect is assumed to prevail as long as the particle eddy interaction time is less than the eddy lifetime, and the displacement of a particle relative to the eddy is less than the eddy length. The flow field was solved separately using the Navier-Stokes finite volume flow solver " TASCflow " commercially available from ASC. The governing equations of the particle motion are solved using the Runge-Kutta Fehlberg technique. The tracking of particles and their locations is based on a finite element interpolation method. The developed Fortran code for predicting particle trajectory and erosion due to particle impact accounts for different types of boundary conditions and handles different frames of reference. The fragmentation of particles after rebound was also implemented. The number of particles seeded upstream of the IGV blades can be determined either by a user defined concentration profile or by a measured concentration profile. Also, particles can be seeded separately in a group at a release position. In the present study, the concentration profile and the initial particle velocity and angle of particle spread were determined from a laser transit anemometer. Two types of particles were used, a narrow size bandwidth (150 - 300 micron) quartz particle and MIL-E 5007 E quartz particle, both of which have a normal distribution. The global rate of erosion, the reduced mass of blades and the changes of the blade geometry were predicted and compared with experimental results at different concentration levels. The baseline axial fan characteristics were measured at different mass flow conditions at a constant speed of rotation. To assess the effects of erosion, the characteristic measurement was repeated after each step of sand ingestion. The predicted aerodynamic performance; adiabatic efficiency, pressure rise coefficient and stall margin before and after erosion degradation were also determined from a developed Fortran program, which is basically a mean line method that uses advanced correlations for aerodynamic losses. Prediction of the particle trajectories show that high numbers of impacts (and maximum erosion) occurred near leading edge and tip region, which were also borne out by locally injected sand tests. The global rate of erosion and the consequent changes of the blade geometry were also predicted and compared with experimental results. The erosion pattern at high concentration of MIL-E 5007 E sand particles depicts net loss of material over the leading edge and the tip corner. The tip clearance increased markedly with a rounding of blade leading edge, which is the main cause of the decrease in efficiency, pressure rise, and surge margin. A parametric study with turbulence and fragmentation effects show that both parameters can influence the erosion rate and blade geometry deterioration. The results of the aerodynamic performance simulation using mean line method, which includes an erosion fault model, show good agreement with experimental results...|$|E

For unsteadiness arising from an <b>upstream</b> nozzle <b>guide</b> <b>vane,</b> it is shown that substantial temporal fluctuations in vortex core velocity and loss generation exist.

40|$|For gas turbines, {{accurate}} {{prediction of}} the external heat transfer coefficient on the high pressure (HP) turbine rotor blades is of immense importance, as this component is critical and operates at material limits. Furthermore the external heat load is the governing boundary condition {{for the design of}} the internal cooling system of the blade. There is a continuous drive to increase the turbine entry temperature to increase the cycle efficiency, whilst developing blade cooling systems with higher efficiency (i. e. using less cooling air). A new systematic procedure has been developed and validated to predict the external heat transfer to a blade surface. The procedure allows for the unsteady effects caused by the passing of <b>upstream</b> nozzle <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> (NGV) wakes. The early part of the suction surface was shown to have a pessimistic prediction of external heat transfer coefficient which resulted in unnecessary overcooling of the blade in this region. The heat transfer aspect is found from the well-known TEXSTAN differential boundary layer method, developed by Mike Crawford at Texas University from the original approach of Spalding and Patankar. The method is validated against the MT 1 turbine tested in the QinetiQ Turbine Test Facility. Predictions and comparisons have also been carried out on the VKI turbine stage. The level of agreement with the test data is shown to be good. Copyright © 2010 byASME...|$|R

To improve engine reliability, durability and maintenance, {{it is necessary to}} understand the interaction of LCF and HCF in these components, which can adversely affect the overall life of the engine while they are occurring simultaneously during a flight cycle. A fully coupled aeromechanical fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analysis in conjunction with a fracture mechanics analysis was numerically performed to predict the effect of representative fluctuating loads on the fatigue life of blisk fan blades. This was achieved by comparing an isolated rotor to a rotor in the presence of <b>upstream</b> inlet <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> (IGVs). A fracture mechanics analysis was used to combine the HCF loading spectrum with an LCF loading spectrum from a simplified engine flight cycle {{in order to determine the}} extent of the fatigue life reduction due to the interaction of the HCF and LCF loads occurring simultaneously. The results demonstrate the reduced fatigue life of the blades predicted by a combined loading of HCF and LCF cycles from a crack growth analysis, as compared to the effect of the individual cycles. In addition, the HCF aerodynamic forcing from the IGVs excited a higher natural frequency of vibration of the rotor blade, which was shown to have a detrimental effect on the fatigue life. The findings suggest that FSI, blade-row interaction and HCF/LCF interaction are important considerations when predicting blade life at the design stage of the engine...|$|R

The {{measurement}} set up and execution of the tests were the same, except for the method of dissipating energy in the system.

The objective has been to see how the Waterpower Laboratory is suited for such a test. It was also important to test the two different dissipation methods and evaluate which should be preferred when performing a pump mode test. During the tests it was observed that the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> angle kept changing. When the results were processed it became evident that the variations in <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> angle during the tests had a big influence on the measured pump curves. Variations in <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> angle has not previously been observed during turbine mode testing. It is presumed that the variation in <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> angles is due to play in the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> system and the design of the <b>guide</b> <b>vanes.</b> The <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> are Francis vanes, and not RPT vanes.

40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access. Within gas {{turbines}} {{the ability to}} design shorter aggressive S-shaped ducts is advantageous from a performance and weight saving perspective. However, current design philosophies tend to treat the S-shaped duct as an isolated component, neglecting the potential advantages of integrating the design with the upstream or downstream components. In this paper such a design concept is numerically developed in which the <b>upstream</b> compressor outlet <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> are incorporated into the first bend of the S-shaped duct. Positioning the vane row within the first bend imparts a strong radial gradient to the pressure field within the vane passage. Tangential lean and axial sweep are employed such that the vane geometry is modified to exactly match the resulting inclined static pressure field. The integrated design is experimentally assessed and compared to a conventional non-integrated design on a fully annular low speed test facility incorporating a single stage axial compressor. Several traverse planes are used to gather five-hole probe data which allow the flow structure to be examined through the rotor, outlet <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> and within the transition ducts. The two designs employ almost identical duct geometry, but integration of the vane row reduces the system length by 21 %. Due to successful matching of the static pressure field, the upstream influence of the integrated vane row is minimal and the rotor performance is unchanged. Similarly the flow development within both S-shaped ducts is similar such that the circumferentially averaged profiles at duct exit are almost identical, and the operation of a downstream component would be unaffected. Overall system loss remains nominally unchanged despite the inclusion of lean and sweep {{and a reduction in}} system length. Finally, the numerical design predictions show good agreement with the experimental data thereby successfully validating the design process...|$|R

The evaluation was repeated with the bypass splitter extended forward to near the fan blade trailing edge. Gross thrust attenuation of over 50 % was achieved with 50 deg variable inlet <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> closure at 100 % corrected fan speed. Gas generator supercharger performance fell off with variable inlet <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> closure but this loss was reduced when a splitter extension was added.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} a general purpose design system being developed at Rolls-Royce plc. The {{key elements of}} the system are a parametric design and rapid meshing capability; a state-of-the-art CFD solver with an adjoint capability; and, an advanced op-timisation system consisting of a library of optimisers. A description is given of each element in the design system. To illustrate its use and flexibility, five different applica-tions of the system to a gas turbine are described. These are: optimisation of the <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> in the bypass duct to minimise excitation of the fan rotor; the same bypass <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> optimisation using sensitivity gradients from the adjoint solver; optimisation of a compressor stage to improve efficiency whilst constraining flow rate, pressure ratio and outlet flow angle; minimisation of the forced excitation of a turbine rotor by modifying {{the wake of the}} <b>upstream</b> nozzle <b>guide</b> vane; and, optimisation of a fan rotor to reduce tone noise. 1 Leigh Lapworth and Shahrokh Shahpa...|$|R
40|$|A {{wind tunnel}} study is {{conducted}} toward hybrid flow control of a full scale transport truck side mirror at ReD 3 : 2 105. A slim <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> is employed for redirecting high-momentum flow toward the mirror wake region. Leading edge separation from the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> is reduced or eliminated {{by means of an}} alternating current-dielectric barrier discharge (AC-DBD) plasma actuator. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements are performed at a range of velocities from 15 to 25 m/s and from windward to leeward angles from 5 deg to 5 deg. Time-averaged velocity fields are obtained {{at the center of the}} mirror for three scenarios: (a) reference case lacking any control elements, (b) <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> only, and (c) combination of the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> and the AC-DBD plasma actuator. The comparison of cases demonstrates that at 25 m/s windward conditions ð 5 degÞ the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> is capable of recovering 17 % momentum with respect to the reference case. No sig-nificant change is observed by activating the AC-DBD plasma actuator. In contrast, at leeward conditions ð 5 degÞ, the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> results in a 20 % momentum loss that is rec-tified to a 6 % recovery with actuation. The above implies that for a truck with two mir-rors, 23 % of momentum may be recovered. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4030724]...|$|R

Experiments in Fluids 24 (1998) 265 — 272 (Springer-Verlag 1998 Measurement and calculation of <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> performance in expanding bends for wind-tunnels B. Lindgren, J. O ® sterlund, A. V. Johansson Abstract The design of <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> for use in expanding bends was investigated both experimentally and numerically. The primary application in mind is the use of expanding corners in wind-tunnels for the purpose of constructing compact circuits with low losses. To investigate the perfor-mance of <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> in realistic situations expansion ratios between 1 and 5 3 were tested in the experiments. These were carried out in an open wind-tunnel specially built for the present purpose. The experimental results demonstrated that suitably designed <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> give very low losses and retained flow quality even for quite substantial expansion ratios. For wind-tunnel applications expansion ratios around 1. 3 seem appropriate, Optimization of a <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> design was done using a two-dimensional cascade code, Mises. A new vane optimized for an expansion ratio of 4 3 gave a two-dimensional total pressure-loss coefficient as low as 0. 041 for a chor...|$|R
40|$|The use of elbow or curved pipe in the {{installation}} of piping has a loss of pressure (pressure drop) which could lead the power of pump that drive the fluid and decrease the energy efficiency of the system. The pressure drop {{is caused by the}} curved shape of the elbow that cause pressure on the outer wall (outter) larger and blocking off the pace of the fluid, and flow pressure losses caused by friction, flow separation and secondary flow. A method {{that can be used to}} reduce flow separation and pressure loss in the elbow is by the insertion <b>guide</b> <b>vane.</b> The test model in the form of rectangular elbow 900   with a radius ratio (rc/Dh) = 1. 1249 without using a <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> and number of <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> insertion one until three <b>guide</b> <b>vanes.</b> With Reynolds number ReDh ≈ 8. 6 × 104. The velocity inlet is uniform, the measured variable is static pressure. Static pressure was measured using an inclined manometer. With variation the number of <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> gives a more effect on the value of pressure drop, the largest pressure drop until 123. 35 % compared to that without <b>guide</b> <b>vane.</b> The velocity distribution profile on the outlet side becomes more uniform. The magnitude of this pressure drop occurs as a result of the increased flow friction and its secondary flow become smaller...|$|R

30|$|The IGV servo {{actuator}} controls {{the position of}} the inlet <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> of the industrial gas turbine system. The actuator provides highly accurate position control. The actuator is a double-acting design that will close the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> on loss of electrical signals. Optimum control of the inlet <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> requires that the actuator accurately and quickly track the demand signals transmitted by the control. The IGV actuator has been designed to provide output forces that exceed the opening and closing requirements. The additional margin helps ensure that the system moves rapidly even under service conditions where the actuator has been contaminated or worn.|$|R
