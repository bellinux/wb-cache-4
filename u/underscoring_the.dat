5|$|The Port Chicago {{disaster}} highlighted systemic racial {{inequality in}} the Navy. A {{year before the}} disaster, in mid-1943, the U.S. Navy had over 100,000 African Americans in service but not one black officer. In the months following the disaster, the Pittsburgh Courier, a newspaper with a large nationwide subscription primarily of African Americans, related the incident and the subsequent mutiny trial in their Double V campaign, a push for victory over not just the Axis powers but also over racial inequality at home. The mutiny trial was seen as <b>underscoring</b> <b>the</b> tense race relations {{in the armed forces}} at the time.|$|E
5|$|US20 and NY5 become West Main Street upon {{entering}} the village, <b>underscoring</b> <b>the</b> road's status as the primary east–west highway through the town. The route continues southeast from the Genesee, passing through the forested but sparsely populated western area of the village. As the route approaches the Livonia, Avon and Lakeville Railroad (LAL) grade crossing, the number of homes increases rapidly, only {{to be replaced by}} businesses in the area surrounding the LAL mainline. Located on the western edge of this transition is NY39, which terminates at this junction. Past the tracks, West Main intersects Rochester Street, a locally important north–south two-lane arterial that continues north of the village to the Rochester suburb of Brighton as East River Road. Shortly after this intersection, the homes return, following US20 and NY5 as West Main enters the heart of the village.|$|E

Sando dispatched two detachments of soldiers to capture Togtokh. They were led into a trap by their Mongolian guide; most were killed. Mongolian princes resisted providing soldiers for Sando’s army. And the prince of the khoshuun which Togtokh had raided refused Sando’s demand to pay compensation to the plundered Chinese merchants.|$|E
25|$|During {{the sixteenth}} century, Spanish priest and philosopher Francisco Suarez (1548-1617) {{expressed}} his objections to colonialism {{in his work}} De Bello et de Indis (On War and the Indies). In this text and others, Suarez supported natural law and conveyed his beliefs that all humans had rights to life and liberty. Along these lines, he argued for the limitation of the imperial powers of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor by <b>underscoring</b> <b>the</b> natural rights of indigenous people. Accordingly, native inhabitants of the colonial Spanish West Indies deserved independence and each island {{should be considered a}} sovereign state with all the legal powers of Spain.|$|E
25|$|The prince {{next came}} across a railway {{switchman}} who told him how passengers constantly rushed {{from one place to}} another aboard trains, never satisfied with where they were and not knowing what they were after; only the children among them ever bothered to look out the windows. A merchant then talked to the prince about his product, a pill that eliminated thirst, which was very popular, saving people fifty-three minutes a week. The prince replied that he would instead gladly use that extra time to go around finding fresh water, again <b>underscoring</b> <b>the</b> materialism and lack of spirituality of a world that knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.|$|E

25|$|The Global Climate Risk Index 4 {{constructed}} {{for the period}} between 1997 and 2006 and covering both human and economic impacts, ranks Honduras 1st in the world, <b>underscoring</b> <b>the</b> country’s very high vulnerability to climate related events, mostly to storms. This vulnerability was evident when Hurricane Mitch struck Honduras in 1998 causing $4 billion in damage and claiming 7,000 lives. Yet climate change is expected to bring even greater weather variability to Honduras with less precipitation overall but more powerful storms and heavy rain during hurricane season spawning landslides and floods. Tegucigalpa and neighboring Comayagüela (which together form the Honduran capital) are the most affected, due to deforestation and the increased vulnerability to landslides.|$|E
25|$|In 1759, the Jesuits {{abandoned}} the sanctuary, and the monarch nominated a treasurer {{to organize and}} catalogue {{the contents of the}} religious buildings and property of the clerics. Ultimately, the Crown took over the lands occupied and rented by the Jesuits. On 4 July 1774, the property of the residence, college of Lamego and the Monastery of Santa Maria de Cárquere were taken over, and João Pinheiro became the caretaker of the financial resources of the institutions. At the same time, the pious legacies, such as perpetual masses, were abolished by the state, <b>underscoring</b> <b>the</b> financial crisis of the time. By the end of the 18th century, the grand sanctuary, was limited to two altars: one dedicated to Saint Joseph and the other to Nossa Senhora da Soledade (Our Lady of Solitude).|$|E
25|$|The taboos (Tanacross injih, Upper Tanana įhjih) are animistic forbidden. In {{addition}} to adhering to {{a code of}} behavior, people observed a variety of taboos designed to prevent misfortune or bad luck. Many of these taboos were associated with hunting or some other aspect of the food gathering process, thus <b>underscoring</b> <b>the</b> importance of these activities for survival of the group. Ravens, cranes, wolverines, foxes, otters, and dogs must never be eaten. The heads of caribou, moose, and Dall sheep may not be fed to the dogs; {{to do so would}} bring the hunter poor luck. Neither the bones nor the carcasses of fur-bearing animals may be fed to dogs, but must be cached in a safe place. Should the dogs get them tha hunter will take no more fur. Women of child-bearing age did not eat bear (Grizzly or Alaskan brown bear and black bear). Young boys could not eat fat from around an animal's eye until adulthood. No animals except dogs could be brought up as pets.|$|E

25|$|It {{first saw}} combat during the Vietnam War. The PRC {{supplied}} the Type 62 light tanks to the NVA {{before the invasion}} of Kampuchea. They were widely used by the Vietnam People's Army in the 1960s and 1970s and {{took part in the}} Ho Chi Minh Campaign in 1975. In 1979 it again saw combat in Vietnam but during the Sino–Vietnamese War. PLA used about two hundred tanks in Vietnam during this conflict and most of these were Type 62 light tanks. They suffered severe losses in combat due to tank's poor protection as the tank’s thin armour could be easily penetrated by hand-held rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) launchers. An upgrade package was developed for the Type 62 soon after the war and was designated Type 62-I. Based on the improvement programs after the Sino–Vietnamese War the Type 62 was found to be too lightly armoured and too poorly armed {{to be used as a}} normal tank. Of the two hundred tanks which invaded Vietnam about half were knocked out, <b>underscoring</b> <b>the</b> Type 62's lack of armour and armament. Since then the Type 62 has been shifted to secondary duties in Southern China, such as reconnaissance, fire support and combat with enemy lightly armoured vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Though all the {{communities}} had had partial success with gaining interest from African-Americans none {{had had to}} deal strongly with opposition in such matters {{and none of them}} had made a point of focusing on it as a priority. A national policy among Bahá'ís had started to form from work of Gregory meeting with Bahá'ís at Fisk University in 1934, a spiritual assembly in Nashville was elected in 1935, and a regional conference was proposed in 1936 to include a visit from the National Assembly. The development encountered the question of a high-profile series of integrated meetings. Indeed, one of the hotel's hosting one of the six resulting meetings objected and the Bahá'ís appeared to relent. W. E. B. DuBois noticed and initially was misinformed {{of the nature of the}} resolution to which then secretary of the national assembly Horace Holley responded that the facts were not as DuBois understood them and that it was the hotel that had relented at the last minute - however a policy had been stated that, short of out of control reactions, integrated meetings should be held but in the case of over-reactions segregated meetings could be held with a longer term goal of fully integrated ones theoretically. But in this case the situation was avoided by the change in judgement of the hotel. All of the shifting options became mute when in 1938 a final policy was voiced - published under the title Advent of Divine Justice by Shoghi Effendi with a frank and prolonged discussion of the problem of race prejudice <b>underscoring</b> <b>the</b> short-term requirement and long term goal of complete integration and freedom from racial prejudice. All meetings were to be integrated and individuals to seek to adjust their habits in the matter. In addition, a matter of policy began that in tie votes in elections minorities were to be automatically given approval of the position. One result was the formation of a Race Unity Committee in 1940 with Louis Gregory and Dorothy Beecher Baker, a White descendent of abolitionists. A situation in the Atlanta Bahá'í community was resolved with integration even to the point of letting White people leave the religion if they couldn't accept the standard. Correspondence among South Carolinian communities buzzed with the development.|$|E
