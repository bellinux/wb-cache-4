Greenwald described Miranda's detention as [...] "clearly intended {{to send a message}} of intimidation to those of <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> reporting on the NSA and GCHQ". The Metropolitan Police and Home Secretary Theresa May called Miranda's detention [...] "legally and procedurally sound". However, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, who helped introduce the bill in the House of Lords, said that under the act, police can only detain someone [...] "to assess whether they are involved in the commission, preparation or instigation of terrorism." [...] He said, [...] "I am very clear that this does not apply, either on its terms or in its spirit, to Mr Miranda." [...] Antonio Patriota the Brazilian Minister of External Relations said that Miranda's detention was [...] "not justifiable". The reasons for Miranda's detention were sought from the police by British politicians and David Anderson Q.C., the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation. The United States government later said that British officials had given them a [...] "heads up" [...] about Miranda's detention, while adding that the decision to detain him had been a British one.|$|E

The British newspaper [...] The Guardian called Silvers [...] "the greatest literary editor there has ever been", while Library of America remembered him as [...] "an unsurpassed editor who helped define and sustain the literary and intellectual culture of New York and America". The New York Times described him as [...] "the voracious polymath, the obsessive perfectionist, the slightly unknowable bachelor-workaholic with the colossal Rolodexes and faintly British diction", and, in his obituary, stated that [...] "under his editorship [...] {{became one of the}} premier intellectual journals in the United States, a showcase for extended, thoughtful essays on literature and politics by eminent writers." [...] Author Louis Begley wrote, [...] "the ideal editor of my – and I would guess every writer’s – dreams is ... Robert B. Silvers, the editor, brain, and heart of the NYRB. When I write a piece for his magazine, of course I have the immeasurable good luck to be edited by him. [...] There is no experience quite like it. Bob knows everything that's worth knowing, a consequence of his unflagging curiosity." [...] "Bob's edits are scrupulous, comprehensive, and precise. They are frequently aimed at saving the reviewer's face." [...] Roger Cohen wrote, after Silvers' death, [...] "No eye for imprecise thought was ever more discerning; no edit a sharper yet gentler distillation than his. ... He was a stickler for accuracy.
