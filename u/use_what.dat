5|$|Although most of {{the judging}} had been {{completed}} before the fire, suggestions {{at the time that}} the committee could <b>use</b> <b>what</b> they had learned from the entrants to propose a new competition with greater clarity as to the requirements led to naught: a 1925 letter to the then Premier John Gunn reveals that there was little to be learned from the competition, as the assessors had found that none of the designs were suitable.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} verify British claims against the British' main opponents in 1941 and 1942, JG 26 and JG 2, is very limited. Only {{two of the}} 30 volumes of War Diaries {{produced}} by JG 26 survived the war. Historian Donald Caldwell has attempted to <b>use</b> <b>what</b> limited German material is available to compare losses and air victory claims but acknowledges the lack of sources leave the possibility for error.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route36, an {{unsigned}} legislative route {{extending from}} Owego to Seneca Falls via Ovid. From Ovid north to Seneca Falls, Route36 followed {{what is now}} NY414 (via NY96 and County Route148 or CR148 in Romulus). The portion of modern NY414 between Watkins Glen and Ovid became Route45 on June16, 1911; however, the route was realigned one year later to <b>use</b> <b>what</b> is now NY96A from Lodi to Interlaken instead. When {{the first set of}} posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the Owego–Interlaken and Ovid–Romulus segments of legislative Route36 became part of NY15, which continued northwest from Romulus to Rochester. From Interlaken to Ovid, NY15 initially followed the post-1912 alignment of legislative Route45 to Lodi and the pre-1912 routing of Route45 to Ovid.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, she {{returned}} to India {{in the wake of}} the economic recession and moved to Mumbai to stay with Priyanka. During a visit to Yash Raj Films studio, Priyanka (who was filming for Pyaar Impossible!) introduced Parineeti to the head of the public relations team of the company. Chopra obtained an internship in the marketing department, joining the production company as a public-relations consultant. She considered it a perfect job, because she could <b>use</b> <b>what</b> she had learned and work in films. Chopra had disliked actors and acting; to her, the profession seemed like an excuse to wear too much makeup. This changed when she observed Priyanka's preparations for her role in 7 Khoon Maaf (2011), which highly influenced her and changed her perception towards acting and actors. Once she learnt more about filmmaking, her respect for the profession increased.|$|E
5|$|NY3 {{remained}} {{on what is}} now NY31 between Middleport and Medina until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York when it was realigned between the two villages to <b>use</b> <b>what</b> is now NY31E. U.S. Route104 was assigned to all of Ridge Road , replacing then-NY31 west of Rochester. As a result, NY31 was shifted southward onto most of NY3 from Niagara Falls to Rochester, including between Middleport and Medina. NY31 was realigned on January1, 1949, to follow its current alignment between the two villages. The former routing of NY31 was redesignated as NY31E, a northerly alternate route of NY31.|$|E
5|$|RAF Fighter Command {{claims against}} the British main opponents in 1941 and 1942—Jagdgeschwader 26 (Fighter Wing 26) and Jagdgeschwader 2 (Fighter Wing 2) —are very {{difficult}} to verify. Only two of the 30 volumes of War Diaries produced by JG 26 survived the war. Historian Donald Caldwell has attempted to <b>use</b> <b>what</b> limited German material is available to compare losses and air victory claims but acknowledges the lack of sources leave the possibility for error. From June 1941 to the spring, 1942, Fighter Command claimed 711 enemy aircraft while losing 411. According to available German records, the loss to JG 2 and JG 26 were reportedly 103.|$|E

5|$|The {{entrance}} {{road was}} constructed from Military Road to the fort's rear gates. Its path is largely {{followed by the}} modern Queen Elizabeth II walk, though the former road was slightly to the south. This walk links the conservation park's visitor centre to the fort gates; {{some of the old}} road can still be seen close to the gates. What was the muster ground is partly taken up by the caravan and camping park and a car park. It was levelled and filled in the 1950s for this <b>use.</b> <b>What</b> remains of this ground, north of the caravan park, was returned to its 1880s profile in 1993 funded by a Federal Government grant. In the 19th century, the muster ground was used for training of the Volunteer Military Force including artillery, who camped on the site. As designed the fort's rear was protected with a wooden palisade or stockade. In 1881 a masonry wall was added, greatly strengthening defence. Most of the stockade was reconstructed in the 1970s; some of the original wooden structure is visible in the fort's north.|$|E

Clothing was somewhat standardized by 1623 when it was made possible for sailors to purchase clothing at fixed prices from the Navy Commissioners. The selection was not extensive; items included: Monmouth capps, Red Caps, Yarne Stockings, Irish Stockings, Blew Shirts, White Shirts, Cotton Waistcoats, Cotton Drawers, Neats Leather Shoes, Blew Neck Clothes, Canvas Suites, Ruggs of one breadth, and Blew Suites. Until 1664, sailors that were pressed into the Navy were not given any clothing, forced to <b>use</b> <b>what</b> clothes they had on their backs until accumulating several months of pay when they could then buy clothing.|$|E
