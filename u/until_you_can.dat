It was also reported that she was seen collaborating with longtime producer RedOne, Giorgio Moroder, Mark Ronson, and Nile Rodgers, among others. Ronson confirmed their collaboration and added that the music recorded with Gaga was [...] "some of [...] favorite music [...] really ever worked on. It's incredible– [...] it. [...] can't wait <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hear it because the music speaks for itself– it's some of [...] favorite musicians of all time are working on it." [...] The producer additionally hinted the involvement of Kevin Parker, the frontman for the Australian psychedelic rock band Tame Impala, which BBC Music later confirmed to be true. In an interview with fashion website Buro247, Ronson claimed {{that it was one}} of his favourite recording that he had worked, and commended the associated musicians and writers.|$|E

2500|$|Accounts on {{the quality}} of the black bear's fur vary. According to Natural History of the Mammalia of India and Ceylon, [...] "Their skins are always poor and mangy, and {{generally}} so greasy that they are very difficult to keep <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> make them over to the dresser", which is corroborated by The great and small game of India, Burma, and Tibet, which states [...] "... the skins are never of any particular value, and in autumn, owing to the masses of yellow fat that are accumulated beneath them, are absolutely useless." [...] The first part of volume II of Mammals of the Soviet Union on the other hand states that Asian black bears yield fur, meat and fat of greater quality than those of brown bears. In British India, grease was the only practical use for black bear carcasses. Bears living near villages were considered the most ideal, as they were almost invariably fatter than their forest dwelling counterparts.|$|E

2500|$|At first, {{the speeches}} were mixed between Secessionists advocating leaving the Union, Conditional Unionists {{holding onto the}} patriotism of earlier times, and Unconditional Unionists insisting that secession was bad policy and unlawful. In {{the second week of}} the {{convention}} debate on February 28, Jeremiah Morton of the Piedmont’s Orange County made an early speech for secession. The Abolitionists fanaticism was [...] "inculcated in the Northern mind and ingrained in the Northern heart, so that you may make any compromise you please, and still, <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> unlearn and unteach the people, we shall find no peace…for thirty years they have been warring upon the fifteen States of the South.” [...] He questioned whether slavery could be safe with Black Republicans taking over all branches of the Federal Government. The Union was already dissolved, and Virginia would surely go with her Southern brethren. If the Confederacy [...] "give us the post of danger, they will also give us the post of honor. They want our statesmen; they want our military; they want the material arm of Virginia to sustain ourselves and them in the great struggles [...]” ...|$|E

Fuller's vision was that ephemeralization will result in ever-increasing standards of living for an ever-growing population despite finite resources. The concept has been embraced by those who argue against Malthusian philosophy.|$|R
