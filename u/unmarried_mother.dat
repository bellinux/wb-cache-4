40|$|Background : There {{has been}} a rapid spread of non-marital childbearing in the Czech Republic {{during the last two}} decades. At the same time, the low birth weight rates of {{children}} born to married and <b>unmarried</b> <b>mothers</b> have converged. Objective : The goal is to explain the diminishing gap in low birth weight. Two explanations are assessed: the changing selection of <b>unmarried</b> <b>mothers</b> from disadvantaged socio-demographic groups, and increasing social support for <b>unmarried</b> <b>mothers.</b> Methods : Data from birth register are analysed. Marital status (married vs. unmarried) disparities in low birth weight are modelled using logistic regression. Further analyses are then performed with a detailed measurement of partnership status. This detailed variable is partially missing and is thus supplemented with multiple imputation. Results : The main explanation for the narrowing gap between the outcomes of children born to married and <b>unmarried</b> <b>mothers</b> is the increasing social support for <b>unmarried</b> <b>mothers.</b> <b>Unmarried</b> motherhood has become less detrimental to a child's birth weight net of maternal demographic characteristics. The decline in selection from disadvantaged socio-demographic groups has also contributed to the convergence. However, the convergence of birth weight trends towards marital children seems to refer mostly to children of partnered mothers, with children of single mothers lagging behind. Conclusions : The positive trends in the health of non-marital children are interpreted as being the result of the increasing institutionalisation of parenthood in non-marital unions. However, this does not apply to unpartnered motherhood, which continues to represent a health disadvantage...|$|R

2500|$|Upon {{completion}} of her education, Browne first {{worked as a}} teacher in hopes of achieving some independence for herself. [...] Her health however, began to decline due to a heart condition that she had, and {{she was no longer}} able to handle the strain of the job, developing additional anxiety problems. [...] She then moved back to Germany where she discovered the budding German woman’s movement, which Helene Stöcker was heading in a fairly radical manner. Stöcker was fighting at this time for women’s rights of motherhood and support for the <b>unmarried</b> <b>mother.</b> [...] Stöcker’s arguments strongly affected Browne as she, later in life, would fight for women’s rights to control their bodies and for the choice to become mother. Browne then began work for the Victoria County History, writing up parish histories, and learning researching skills that she would utilize in her later career. She left this job in 1907, moving into the position of Librarian at Morley College in South London. Here she was able to take in various controversial lectures, with topics ranging from marriage and divorce reform to eugenics. [...] Working at the college also allowed Browne to see the different social problems faced by both working class and professional class women. [...] Browne met her first male lover here, known as her “demi-semi-lover” and never noted by name, only by his sexual prowess. She also joined the Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU) in 1908, which marked the beginning of her social activism.|$|E

He complained that his estranged wife, Elizabeth never sent him food parcels, despite her having been {{provided}} with money by the Loyalist Prisoners' Association (LPA). The LPA {{was unaware of}} the Young couple's estrangement. The delivery of food parcels by women to imprisoned members was a long-established practice by the UDA and a [...] "particular source of pride for the organisation". Ogilby was required to make up and send him the food parcels herself which she felt was an imposition as these had to come out of her own money, although she was almost destitute. When Ogilby mistakenly repeated Young's complaint in a Sandy Row pub, the local Sandy Row women's UDA unit (of which Elizabeth was a member) overheard her words and became violently angry, especially as Elizabeth was able to prove that she had been sending her husband food parcels. Ogilby's comments were regarded by the women's UDA as a grievous insult to its integrity, as the unit was responsible for the assembly and distribution of the parcels. The group was already antagonistic due to Ogilby's affair with Young, and her defamatory remarks only added fuel to their wrath. The women considered her behaviour in public immoral, ostentatious, and extremely unconventional because she frequented clubs and pubs on her own instead of with female friends which was the custom in Sandy Row. Furthermore, they believed her loud, outspoken and maverick personality, status as an <b>unmarried</b> <b>mother,</b> and habit of what was described by a local as [...] "flaunting herself" [...] was a cultural infraction that brought shame upon their community.|$|E

We are interested in examining how the impact of mothers’ unmarried status on birth outcomes changes as nonmarital childbearing shifts from a marginal to a relatively common behaviour. The results of the analysis reveal that the health disadvantage gap between marital and nonmarital births has narrowed significantly over the past decade in Spain.
