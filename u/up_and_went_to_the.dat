25|$|In {{the next}} race, the Austrian Grand Prix, Montoya finally outpaced his {{teammate}} Ralf Schumacher in qualifying {{and took a}} career-best second. It looked better and better for him {{as he took the}} lead at the start and pulled away, with second-placed Ralf holding up a string of five cars behind him. But, after 10 laps, Schumacher retired with brake failure. Montoya was struggling with the same problems, and Schumacher had been told to hold the others up so that Montoya could build a gap. With Ralf Schumacher out, the five drivers, led by Michael Schumacher began to close on Montoya at over a second a lap. Soon Schumacher was right on Montoya's tail and tried to pass him around the outside at Remus Curve. Montoya kept on the inside, braked late, locked <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gravel. Schumacher was also forced to go to the gravel to avoid Montoya. Montoya rejoined seventh, just behind Schumacher. Montoya went for an early stop which solved his problems. He was set for one point in sixth until he stopped on the track with a hydraulic failure. After the race, Schumacher said that 'all Montoya was doing was to try to take Schumacher out with himself off the circuit'.|$|E

2500|$|Nilus of Sinai (d. c.430), in his Letter to Heliodorus Silentiarius, records {{a miracle}} in which St. Plato of Ankyra {{appeared}} to a Christian in a dream. The Saint was recognized because {{the young man}} had often seen his portrait. [...] This recognition of a religious apparition from likeness to an image was also a characteristic of pagan pious accounts of appearances of gods to humans, and was a regular topos in hagiography. [...] One critical recipient of a vision from Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki apparently specified that the saint resembled the [...] "more ancient" [...] images of him – presumably the 7th century mosaics still in Hagios Demetrios. [...] Another, an African bishop, had been rescued from Arab slavery by a young soldier called Demetrios, who told him to go to his house in Thessaloniki. [...] Having discovered that most young soldiers in the city seemed to be called Demetrios, he gave <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> largest church in the city, to find his rescuer on the wall.|$|E
