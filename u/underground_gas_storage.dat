25|$|The {{deregulation}} {{activity in}} the <b>underground</b> <b>gas</b> <b>storage</b> arena has attracted independent storage service providers to develop storage facilities. The capacity made available would then be leased to third-party customers such as marketers and electricity generators. It is expected that in the future, this group would take more market share, as more deregulation takes place. Currently in the US, this group accounts for 18 percent of overall storage deliverability and 13 percent of working gas capacity in the US.|$|E

2500|$|On 11 January 2007, the Ministry of Trade and Industry of Finland made a {{statement}} on the environmental impact assessment programme of the Russia-Germany natural gas pipeline, in which it mentioned that alternative routes via the Baltic states, Kaliningrad and/or Poland might theoretically be shorter than the route across the Baltic Sea, {{would be easier to}} flexibly increase the capacity of the pipeline, and might have better financial results. [...] There were also calls from Sweden to consider rerouting the pipeline onto dry land. Poland had proposed the construction of a second line of the Yamal–Europe pipeline, as well as the Amber pipeline through the Baltic states and Poland as land-based alternatives to the offshore pipeline. [...] The Amber project foresees laying a natural gas pipeline across the Tver, Novgorod and Pskov oblasts in Russia and then through Latvia and Lithuania to Poland, where it would be re-connected to the Yamal–Europe pipeline. [...] Latvia has proposed using its <b>underground</b> <b>gas</b> <b>storage</b> facilities if the onshore route were to be used. [...] Proponents have claimed that the Amber pipeline would cost half as much as an underwater pipeline, would be shorter, and would have less environmental impact. [...] Critics of this proposal say that in this case it would be more expensive for the suppliers over the long-term perspective, because the main aim of the project is to reduce transit costs. [...] Nord Stream AG has responded that the Baltic Sea would be the only route for the pipeline and it will not consider an overland alternative.|$|E

The Transylvanian storages have smaller capacity because the layers are thinner, consisting of interbedded sandstones, silts and marls, with many lithological and facies variations, lower porosities and permeabilities. Geology of the reservoir has to be well known before constructing a deposit. Most important parameters are: depth of the reservoir, thickness, porosity, permeability, pore volume, structural model, tectonics, stratigraphic and lithological variations, type of aquifer, etc. ...|$|R
