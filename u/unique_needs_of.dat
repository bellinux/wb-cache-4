2500|$|Literacy is {{communication}} in all forms such as listening, speaking, reading, and writing. [...] Literacy development begins in infancy {{and continues to}} mature into adulthood.

Literacy skills are not a prerequisite to utilizing a semantic compaction system, however this system can be used to promote the development of literacy skills. [...] Essential components of literacy development include phonological awareness, vocabulary development, phonics, word identification, and comprehension. [...] Semantic compaction is a rule driven system that supports the development of literacy through vocabulary development, morphology development, and comprehension. [...] In addition, the icons can be used to help teach phonological awareness. [...] For example, when teaching phonological awareness and segmenting initial sounds the instructor will say a phoneme and visually present the phoneme at the same time. [...] Then the student will point to a picture that starts with that phoneme.

[...] Positive perception of inpatient postpartum nursing care {{have been found to be}} an incredible influence in a young mother's success with breastfeeding. [...] In a study conducted in the United States, young mothers reported positive postpartum experiences, especially in respect to breastfeeding initiation and mother-infant bonding, when their nursing care was targeted for adolescent mothers. The mothers reported that they felt better cared for and more motivated to initiate and sustain breastfeeding when nurses where friendly, patient, respectful and understanding of their individual needs. [...] Maternal self-confidence is a contributing factor that influences positive breastfeeding outcomes especially among adolescent mothers. Empowerment, compassion, understanding and patience are key when caring for young moms.|$|E

It is indicated that own education is internationally accepted as one of the major rights of minority groups. Within the international context, for example in the treaties of Unesco and in the educational provision of several countries, it is accepted that minority groups also prefer their own education institutions in order to effectively provide in their <b>unique</b> educational <b>needs.</b> In this article the more general requirements, regarding the characteristics of the education institution needed to meet the <b>unique</b> educational <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> a particular minority group are also identified.

The conclusion arrived at is that the mentioned situation does not oppose Christian guidelines if minorities need each other to influence educational change, that the acknowledgement of the educational rights of minority groups promotes national unity, that the educational rights of minorities should imply freedom of establishment, denomination and institution and that the educational rights of minorities are fully realised if their education is financially supported by government on an equal basis to that of the majority...|$|R
