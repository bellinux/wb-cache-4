25|$|One of {{the most}} common effectors is the gripper. In its {{simplest}} manifestation, it consists of just two fingers which can open and close to pick <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> go of a range of small objects. Fingers can for example, be made of a chain with a metal wire run through it. Hands that resemble and work more like a human hand include the Shadow Hand and the Robonaut hand. Hands that are of a mid-level complexity include the Delft hand. Mechanical grippers can come in various types, including friction and encompassing jaws. Friction jaws use all the force of the gripper to hold the object in place using friction. Encompassing jaws cradle the object in place, using less friction.|$|E
500|$|Hail to the Thiefs lyrics were {{influenced}} by what Yorke called [...] "the general sense of ignorance and intolerance and panic and stupidity" [...] following the 2000 election of US President George W. Bush. He took words and phrases from discussion of the unfolding War on Terror and used them in the album's lyrics and artwork. He denied any intent to make a [...] "political statement" [...] with the songs, and told the Toronto Star: [...] "I desperately tried not to write anything political, anything expressing the deep, profound terror I'm living with day to day. But it's just fucking there, and eventually {{you have to give}} it <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> it happen." ...|$|E

"This Is England", {{much like}} the rest of the album that came out later that year, had been {{drastically}} re-engineered by Rhodes, with synths and football-style chants added to Strummer's incomplete recordings. Although Howard was an adept drummer, drum machines were used for virtually all of the percussion tracks. For the remainder of his life, Strummer largely disowned the album, although he did profess that [...] "I really like 'This Is England' [...] 'North and South' is a vibe." [...] In early 1986, the Clash disbanded. Strummer later described the group's end: [...] "When the Clash collapsed, we were tired. There had been a lot of intense activity in five years. Secondly, I felt we'd run out of idea gasoline. And thirdly, I wanted to shut <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> someone else have a go at it." ...|$|E

Xiang Yu said, [...] "Books are only useful in helping me remember my name. Mastering swordsmanship allows me to face only one opponent, so it's not worth learning. I want to learn how to defeat thousands of enemies." [...] Hence, his uncle tried to educate him in military strategies and the art of wars instead, but Xiang Yu stopped learning after he had grasped the main ideas; Xiang Liang was disappointed with his nephew, who showed no sign of motivation or apparent talent apart from his great strength, so he gave <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> Xiang Yu decide his own future.|$|E

2500|$|In one of {{his first}} such cases, in 1894, he {{represented}} Alice N. Lincoln, a Boston philanthropist and noted crusader for the poor. He appeared at public hearings to promote investigations into conditions in the public poor-houses. Lincoln, who had visited these poor-houses for years, saw inmates dwelling in misery and the temporarily unemployed thrown in together with the mentally ill and hardened criminals. Brandeis spent nine months and held fifty-seven public hearings, at one such hearing proclaiming, [...] "Men are not bad. Men are degraded largely by circumstances....It is the duty of every man...to help them <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> them feel that there is some hope for them in life."

2500|$|Behind the {{scoreboard}} {{in center field}} there is a pier where ferries can tie <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> off fans right at the park. On game days, fans take to the water of McCovey Cove in boats and even in kayaks, often with fishing nets {{in the hope of}} collecting a home run ball. (This echoes what used to happen during McCovey's playing days. Before Candlestick Park's upper deck was extended, the area behind right field was occupied by three small bleacher sections and a lot of open space. Kids in those bleachers would gather behind the right field fence when [...] "Stretch" [...] would come to the plate.) Just beyond the wall is a public waterfront promenade, where fans can watch three innings of a game through the wall's archways, free of charge, albeit with a somewhat obstructed view. Across the cove from the ballpark is McCovey Point and China Basin Park, featuring monuments to past Giants legends.|$|E
2500|$|The tub {{boats were}} hauled <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> down the {{inclined}} planes by chains which were operated {{in most cases}} by waterwheels; the transit took five minutes or so. There were standby steam engines {{at some of the}} inclined planes. However the Hobbacott Inclined Plane (both the steepest and that allowing the greatest height difference) used a different system of harnessing water power: water filled a very large bucket and it was simply the weight of the water that pulled the ascending tub boat up the incline. The bucket operated in a deep vertical shaft, and at the bottom a plug was opened and the water ran to waste along an adit which connected to the lower level of the canal; the descending bucket pulled an empty bucket up in the same operation. The full bucket had to be heavy enough to pull a loaded tub boat up the 1 in 4½ gradient as well as overcoming friction, and Green calculated that a weight of about fifteen tons was necessary. This was successful, and the bucket raised a boat up the plane in about four minutes, which was about one half of the time taken when the [...] standby steam engine was used.|$|E
2500|$|The {{period of}} the books begins in the 1920s {{and moves to the}} 1970s as the 50 books {{progress}} (the character being seemingly ageless). In early books most activities are illegal, although directed at villains. In later books, this becomes less so. In books written during World War II, The Saint was recruited by the government to help track spies and similar undercover work. Later he became a cold warrior fighting Communism. The quality of writing also changes; early books have a freshness which becomes replaced by cynicism in later works. A few Saint stories crossed into science fiction and fantasy, [...] "The Man Who Liked Ants" [...] and the early novel The Last Hero being examples; one Saint short story, [...] "The Darker Drink", was even published in the October 1952 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. When early Saint books were republished in the 1960s to the 1980s, it was not uncommon to see freshly written introductions by Charteris apologizing for the out-of-date tone; according to a Charteris [...] "apology" [...] in a 1969 paperback of Featuring the Saint, he attempted to update some earlier stories when they were reprinted but gave <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> them sit as period pieces. The 1963 edition of the short story collection The Happy Highwayman contains examples of abandoned revisions; in one story published in the 1930s ("The Star Producers"), references to actors of the 1930s were replaced for 1963 with names of current movie stars; another 1930s-era story, [...] "The Man Who Was Lucky", added references to atomic power.|$|E
