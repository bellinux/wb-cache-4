25|$|Carathéodory {{conjecture}}: This conjecture {{states that}} a closed convex three times differentiable surface admits {{at least two}} <b>umbilic</b> points. The first work on this conjecture was in 1924 by Hans Hamburger, who noted that it follows from the following stronger claim: the half-integer valued index of the principal curvature foliation of an isolated <b>umbilic</b> is at most one.|$|E
25|$|For {{the sphere}} the curvatures of all normal {{sections}} are equal, so every point is an <b>umbilic.</b> The sphere and plane {{are the only}} surfaces with this property.|$|E

40|$|When an {{electrical}} field {{is applied to}} a homeotropic nematic slab, a Freedericksz transition can occur, with a complete degeneracy for {{the direction of the}} projection of the director in the plane of the slab, n⊥. A rotation of n⊥ by 2 π gives rise to point singularities called <b>umbilics.</b> The presence of a shear lifts the degeneracy of n⊥, and reduces the unfavoured domains to 2 π inversion walls which strongly affect the interaction between <b>umbilics.</b> We present theoretical and experimental investigations on the structure and on the shear induced displacements of walls and connected <b>umbilics...</b>|$|R
25|$|At {{any point}} on a surface a normal {{direction}} is {{at right angles}} to the surface because the sphere these are the lines radiating out {{from the center of the}} sphere. The intersection of a plane that contains the normal with the surface will form a curve that is called a normal section, and the curvature of this curve is the normal curvature. For most points on most surfaces, different sections will have different curvatures; the maximum and minimum values of these are called the principal curvatures. Any closed surface will have at least four points called umbilical points. At an <b>umbilic</b> all the sectional curvatures are equal; in particular the principal curvatures are equal. Umbilical points can be thought of as the points where the surface is closely approximated by a sphere.|$|E
2500|$|Bifurcation {{theory has}} been applied to connect quantum systems to the {{dynamics}} of their classical analogues in atomic systems, molecular systems, and resonant tunneling diodes. [...] Bifurcation theory has also been applied to the study of laser dynamics and a number of theoretical examples which are difficult to access experimentally such as the kicked top and coupled quantum wells. The dominant reason for the link between quantum systems and bifurcations in the classical equations of motion is that at bifurcations, the signature of classical orbits becomes large, as Martin Gutzwiller points out in his classic work on quantum chaos. Many kinds of bifurcations have been studied with regard to links between classical and quantum dynamics including saddle node bifurcations, Hopf bifurcations, <b>umbilic</b> bifurcations, period doubling bifurcations, reconnection bifurcations, tangent bifurcations, and cusp bifurcations.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe main notions {{concerning}} <b>umbilics</b> {{and lines}} of principal curvature, traditionally studied on surfaces in R 3, are extended {{in this paper}} to surfaces immersed in R 4. Departing from the classical second fundamental form and the ellipse of curvature of the immersion of a surface into R 4 here {{are studied in detail}} the concepts of a) axiumbilic points, analogous to classical <b>umbilics</b> since at them the ellipse of curvature has equal axes, and b) periodic lines of axial curvature, called here axial cycles, corresponding both to principal and mean curvature cycles in the classical R 3 case. To any immersed surface in R 4 its axial configurations: the principal configuration and the mean curvature configuration are associated. For surfaces in R 3, the first one reduces to the configuration by <b>umbilics</b> and principal lines, while the second one gives the configuration by <b>umbilics</b> and integral foliations of the mean curvature line fields. Also the notion of principal structural stability of immersions of surfaces into R 3 is extended to that of axial structural stability, for the case of surfaces in R 4. Sufficient conditions for the axial structural stability are provided in terms of axiumbilics, axial cycles and the asymptotic behavior of all the other lines of axial curvatur...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{collective}} motion of polar active particles confined to ellipsoidal surfaces. The geometric constraints lead {{to the formation of}} vortices that encircle surface points of constant curvature (<b>umbilics).</b> We have found that collective motion patterns are particularly rich on ellipsoids, with four <b>umbilics</b> where vortices tend to be located near pairs of umbilical points to minimize their interaction energy. Our results provide a new perspective on the migration of living cells, which most likely use the information provided from the curved substrate geometry to guide their collective motion.

50|$|The Conjecture {{claims that}} any convex, closed and {{sufficiently}} smooth surface in three dimensional Euclidean space needs to admit {{at least two}} <b>umbilic</b> points. In {{the sense of the}} Conjecture, the spheroid with only two <b>umbilic</b> points and the sphere, all points of which are <b>umbilic,</b> are examples of surfaces with minimal and maximal numbers of umbilics. For the conjecture to be well posed, or the <b>umbilic</b> points to be well-defined, the surface needs to be at least twice differentiable.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Fitting a sparse {{surface to}} {{approximate}} vast dense data {{is of interest}} for many applications: reverse engineering, recognition and compression, etc. The present work provides an approach to fit a Loop subdivision surface to a dense triangular mesh of arbitrary topology, whilst preserving and aligning the original features. The natural ridge-joined connectivity of <b>umbilics</b> and ridge-crossings is used as the connectivity of the control mesh for subdivision, so that the edges follow salient features on the surface. Further more, the chosen features and connectivity characterise the overall shape of the original mesh, since ridges capture extreme principal curvatures and ridges start and end at <b>umbilics.</b> A metric of Hausdorff distance including curvature vectors is proposed and implemented in a distance transform algorithm to construct the connectivity. Ridge-colour matching is introduced as a criterion for edge flipping to improve feature alignment. Several examples are provided to demonstrate the feature-preserving capability of the proposed approach...|$|R

40|$|Is {{classification}} of the singularities of the potential, concerning the homogeneous deformations in Finite Elasticity, an important material property? The present study {{demonstrates that the}} answer to the question is positive. Since the type of singularity prescribes Maxwell's sets in the neighborhood of a singularity, the emergence of multiphase strain states depends on the performed classification. Bifurcation analysis and singularity classification for homogeneous deformations of any hyperelastic, anisotropic, homogeneous material under any type of conservative quasi-static loading is performed. Critical conditions for branching of the equilibrium paths are defined and their post-critical behavior is studied. Singularities corresponding to simple and compound branching are classified according to Arnold's classification. Unconstrained materials are only considered. Special attention is given to the compound branching (D-k) cases requiring elaborate mathematical techniques. The geometry of the <b>umbilics</b> is described with the equilibrium paths and the cusp lines. With the help of Maxwell's sets in the neighborhood of the <b>umbilics,</b> the emergence of discontinuous strain fields is demonstrated. The theory is applied to orthotropic and transversely isotropic materials as well. The proposed method may directly be applied to crystals stability problems. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Given {{a smooth}} surface, a blue (red) ridge is a curve along which the maximum (minimum) {{principal}} curvature has an extremum along its curvature line. Ridges are curves of extremal curvature and encode important informations used in surface analysis or segmentation. But reporting the ridges of a surface requires manipulating {{third and fourth}} order derivatives whence numerical difficulties. Additionally, ridges have self-intersections and complex interactions with the <b>umbilics</b> of the surface whence topological difficulties. In this context, we make two contributions for the computation of ridges of polynomial parametric surfaces. First, by instantiating to the polynomial setting a global structure theorem of ridge curves proved in a companion paper, we develop the first certified algorithm to produce a topological approximation of the curve P encoding all the ridges of the surface. The algorithm exploits the singular structure of P <b>umbilics</b> and purple points, and reduces the problem to solving zero dimensional systems using Gröbner basis. Second, for cases where the zero-dimensional systems cannot be practically solved, we develop a certified plot algorithm at any fixed resolution.
