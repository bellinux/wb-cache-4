40|$|Life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias are {{associated}} with the existence of stable and unstable spiral waves. Termination of such complex spatio-temporal patterns by local control is substantially limited by anchoring of spiral waves at natural heterogeneities. Far-field pacing (FFP) is a new local control strategy that {{has been shown to be}} capable of <b>unpinning</b> waves from obstacles. In this article, we investigate in detail the FFP <b>unpinning</b> mechanism for a single rotating wave pinned to a heterogeneity. We identify qualitatively different phase regimes of the rotating wave showing that the concept of vulnerability is important but not sufficient to explain the failure of <b>unpinning</b> in all cases. Specifically, we find that a reduced excitation threshold can lead to the failure of <b>unpinning,</b> even inside the vulnerable window. The critical value of the excitation threshold (below which no <b>unpinning</b> is possible) decreases for higher electric field strengths and larger obstacles. In contrast, for a high excitation threshold, the success of <b>unpinning</b> is determined solely by vulnerability, allowing for a convenient estimation of the <b>unpinning</b> success rate. In some cases, we also observe phase resetting in discontinuous phase intervals of the spiral wave. This effect is important for the application of multiple stimuli in experiments...|$|R

30|$|Coercive field {{decreases}} {{with increasing}} intensity, regardless of wavelength. Note that, exchange bias and coercive field {{are related to}} pinned and <b>unpinned</b> spins of antiferromagnet, respectively [6]. We can observe the independence of coercive field with respect to wavelength {{from the fact that}} <b>unpinned</b> spins of BFO should be easily rotatable with respect to the exchange-coupled spins of LSMO. The carrier concentration in LSMO may be different for red and blue lights, which results in different angle rotation for LSMO spins. Due to exchange coupling between Mn and Fe spins, <b>unpinned</b> spins of BFO should also be rotated through the same angle as in LSMO. When we rotate the spin of LSMO through the applied magnetic field, the <b>unpinned</b> spin in BFO rotates accordingly. Therefore, the coercive field should have no wavelength dependence. We can observe the dependence of coercive field with respect to intensity from the fact that an increase in intensity should result in a corresponding increase of rotated spins of LSMO. Through exchange coupling between Mn and Fe spins, the number of rotated <b>unpinned</b> spins of BFO should also increase. When we rotate the spin of LSMO through the applied magnetic field, the increased number of <b>unpinned</b> BFO spins should be easily rotated, due to decreased spin drag effects [6]. Therefore, the coercive field should decrease as light intensity increases, consistent with Figure  4 c.|$|R

5000|$|The Fermi level pinning {{effect is}} strong in many commercially {{important}} semiconductors (Si, Ge, GaAs), {{and thus can}} be very frustrating {{for the design of}} semiconductor devices. For example, nearly all metals form a significant Schottky barrier to n-type germanium and an ohmic contact to p-type germanium, since the valence band edge is strongly pinned to the metal's Fermi level. The solution to this inflexibility requires additional processing steps such as adding an intermediate insulating layer to <b>unpin</b> the bands.

40|$|Vortex creep {{theory is}} used to {{construct}} model noise power spectra for three physically distinct types of events which might give rise to pulsar timing noise. These are 'pure' events, in which vortex <b>unpinning</b> {{is the source of}} the initial frequency jump; 'mixed' events, in which the initial frequency jump is produced by some physical process other than vortex <b>unpinning</b> but leads to the <b>unpinning</b> of some vortices; and 'external' events, in which the initial frequency jumps responsible for noise do not involve any vortex <b>unpinning.</b> For the first two types of events, it is found that relaxation processes in the region responsible for the noise will give rise to structure in the observed power spectra, while for external events, the resulting noise spectra will not be influenced by vortex creep. The theoretical results are compared with observed power spectra for 25 pulsars. The absence of structure in the observed power spectra of the Crab and Vela pulsars within the range of time scales which characterize their postglitch behavior indicates that the pinning regions which play a role in postglitch behavior do not experience the small <b>unpinning</b> events leading to timing noise...|$|R

5000|$|Beginning {{as a young}} woman, Dickinson has {{developed}} and presented performances, exhibitions, and public art projects that merge mythological, autobiographical, geographical, and historical lines of inquiry. During a twelve-year period, Dickinson moved her creative practice to a 200-acre wetland in rural Illinois often living outdoors--sleeping in abandoned deer beds--or inhabiting a six-floor silo and bat-infested barn. In that place and its surrounds--rural, agricultural, and the beginnings of exurbia--Dickinson worked in cooperation with others to <b>unpin</b> straightened rivers, remove agricultural tiles, rout buckthorn, and safely conduct controlled burns. She became a beekeeper and herbalist and, for those twelve years, sat daily and nightly beneath the sun, moon, and stars in order to observe and integrate their alignments. In so doing, Dickinson familiarized herself with one place--its stories and mythologies entwined with its geographies, communities, and climate--and the wider connection of one place to others and all that is embodied within that suggestion. From that learned sensibility, Dickinson developed and presented a series of “performances” in the form in large, collaborative events in which, after months and even years of preparation, she stepped back allowing co-authorship with the landscapes and inhabitants with whom she shared a particular dwelling-place. In these ways, Dickinson embodies, in the best contemporary sense, what generations of [...] "eco artists" [...] and feminist practices have advocated: permeability and the interdependence of learning and making.|$|E

40|$|The pinning and {{collective}} unpinning of superfluid vortices in a decelerating container {{is a key}} element of the canonical model of neutron star glitches and laboratory spin-down experiments with helium II. Here the dynamics of vortex (un) pinning is explored using numerical Gross-Pitaevskii calculations, with a view to understanding the triggers for catastrophic unpinning events (vortex avalanches) that lead to rotational glitches. We explicitly identify three triggers: rotational shear between the bulk condensate and the pinned vortices, a vortex proximity effect driven by the repulsive vortex-vortex interaction, and sound waves emitted by moving and repinning vortices. So long as dissipation is low, sound waves emitted by a repinning vortex are found to be sufficiently strong to <b>unpin</b> a nearby vortex. For both ballistic and forced vortex motion, the maximum inter-vortex separation required to <b>unpin</b> scales inversely with pinning strength. Comment: 16 pages, 18 figure...|$|E
40|$|We use a {{sensitive}} magneto-optical microscopy technique to image the magnetization response of micron-scale ferromagnetic disks {{to changes in}} applied magnetic field. This differential technique relies on a modulated applied magnetic field which allows us to measure changes in magnetization < 1 % with sub-micron resolution. The disks are magnetized in single vortex domains, with defects in the material serving to pin the vortex core at particular positions. By applying a small AC magnetic field, we measure the deformation of the magnetization while the core remains pinned. We can also characterize {{the strength of the}} pinning site by increasing the AC magnetic field to <b>unpin</b> the vortex core. While pinned, we find that the magnetization away from the core reorients slightly to better align with an applied field. Additionally, an applied field causes the pinned core itself to tilt {{in the direction of the}} field. Once the field is large enough to <b>unpin</b> the core, this tilt disappears, and the core instead translates across the disk. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|The neutron {{vortices}} {{thought to}} exist in the inner crust of a neutron star interact with nuclei and are expected to pin to the nuclear lattice. Evidence for long-period precession in pulsars, however, requires that pinning be negligible.

In the absence of precession, however, vortices could pin to the lattice with sufficient strength to explain the giant glitches observed in many radio pulsar...|$|E
