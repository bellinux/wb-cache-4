5|$|During a {{brainstorm}} session, Michael, Jim, and Dwight {{decide to}} set up a sting operation to observe Danny's sales techniques. They set up Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) as the CEO of the fictional company Solartech in Dwight's office, fitted with security cameras, and watch from another room. Danny is then sent in to try to make a sale. All starts well until Meredith attempts to seduce him. Dwight and Jim send in Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) and Ryan Howard (B. J.

5|$|The game {{begins in}} Indocine, a fictional Southeast Asian country. The player {{controls}} a Super Apache helicopter {{as part of}} the STRIKE covert operations force, led by General Earle (John Marzilli) and assisted by technician Hack (Antwon Tanner) and propagandist Andrea Gray (Susan Turner-Cray). The antagonist is Colonel LeMonde (Bo Hopkins), a spy-turned-warlord who has stolen a nuclear weapon. Allied to STRIKE in Indocine is guerrilla leader Naja Hana (Moon Bloodgood), whose forces join the player in attacking LeMonde's forces. Meanwhile, LeMonde bluffs STRIKE by arming a fake nuclear bomb in an old temple compound, which results in Naja attempting to locate the warhead and LeMonde. At the same time, the player is sent on a wild goose chase attacking a decoy convoy thought to have the nuclear bomb being transported away from Indocine. In actuality, LeMonde escapes capture long before STRIKE could catch <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> he managed to smuggle the real nuclear bomb away from Indocine off-screen. This prompts the player to extract Naja from the now booby-trapped compound before the whole compound blew up sky high. Nonetheless, his forces are eventually defeated in Indocine and STRIKE conducts their operations in the South China Sea, where LeMonde is discovered dealing with Napoleon Hwong (Philip Tan), head of a fictional Triad-like criminal organization known as the Octad. The player recruits mercenary Harding Cash (Jamie Donovan) in battling the pirate warlord in an attempt to recover the missing nuclear weapon. After defeating Hwong's forces, the player and Harding manage to capture and interrogate Hwong for information concerning the whereabouts of the nuke long enough before Hwong commits suicide. The player eventually heads to Pyongyang, North Korea, where the stolen nuke is located.|$|E

25|$|The Carol Ferris {{version of}} Star Sapphire appears in , voiced again by Olivia d'Abo but without her accent this time. Her costume here {{is similar to}} the one {{currently}} worn by the Star Sapphires. She is hired to be part of Vandal Savage's Legion of Doom since she is the counterpart to Green Lantern. Her plan is to break Hal Jordan's will by making him believe he had let a hostage (almost identical to Carol) get killed by a terrorist that he could have easily defeated before harm befell her. As Hal mourns the dead girl, Carol walks <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> berates him for his failure to save the woman and for hurting Carol, driving her into becoming Star Sapphire. Weeping, Hal takes off his ring, becoming a broken man as he continues to mourn the dead woman. When Batman arrives, he reveals that the woman was an android used by Star Sapphire to trick him, and that she had exposed him to the Scarecrow's fear gas in order to break his will, to which Hal dons his ring and becomes Green Lantern once more. When the Justice League storms the Hall of Doom, she faces off against him again. As they fight, Hal expresses anger over Carol's plan, saying that he couldn't believe what she did, only for her to coldly remark that he broke her heart, and she would never stop trying to kill him for it. She manages to capture him but he escapes and knock her out. Hal proceeds to take away Carol's Star Sapphire gem, reverting her back to normal, and admits that he keeps hurting her. This version is shown to be able to create both energy blasts and hard constructs. She was the only one to use the non-lethal version of Batman's contingency plans and was the last member to be defeated.|$|E
