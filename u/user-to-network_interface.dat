40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} specification of a BISDN <b>user-to-network</b> <b>interface</b> (UNI) named DRAGON (Distributed Access Generic Optical Network) for SMDS networks. The UNI allows clusters of nodes {{to be connected to}} an SMDS network via fiber-optic lines. The capacity of each line is shared by all the nodes in the cluster to make more efficient use of bandwidth. Within each cluster, transmissions are scheduled on first-come-first-served (FCFS) order of message arrivals, by considering a globally distributed queue. A novel scheme is proposed for controlling access to the fiber-optic transmission network. By using two logically separate subnetworks called the reservation channel and the reservation ring Slot reservations and message transmissions can proceed independently and concurrently. The reservation channel is a broadcast channel for notifying nodes within the cluster when to reserve a slot. Access to the reservation channel is controlled by the reservation ring: a token ring n [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The Israeli network {{converted}} to using a Metropolitan Area Network back in February 1994. This MAN network provides coverage over 250 kilometers and 3 major cities in Israel. The seven Israeli universities use Ethernet ports to the MAN running at 10 Mbit/s. This paper describes {{the lessons learned}} from running such a nationwide Ethernet netwo::k. 1. Background Many European organizations are exploring Ethernet port access as an economical method of accessing an ATM network. the ATM Forum is advancing the L-UN 1 standard (LAN Emulation <b>User-to-Network</b> <b>Interface)</b> which will make Ethernet connections to ATM a worldwide standard. This paper will hopefully explain to potential network administrators {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of using an Ethernet access method for their national connections. The network analyzed is not an ATM network but rather a precursor to ATM networks-the DQDB MAN network. Israel has been running a nationwide Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) since Febru...|$|E
