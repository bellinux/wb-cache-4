25|$|The most {{important}} geological {{feature of the}} Williamson diamond mine is the kimberlite pipe on which it is located. At 146 square kilometers in area at surface level, it ranks as the largest economically exploitable diamond-bearing volcanic pipe in the world. Recent exploratory drill cores conducted by De Beers have indicated that the pipe is a pyroclastic kimberlite, not a hypabyssal kimberlite as earlier suspected. This indicates {{that it may be}} possible to extend the current 90-meter deep open pit to as much as 350 meters deep, and continue down even further with <b>underground</b> <b>mining</b> <b>operations.</b> However, a review of mine operations and long term plans continues.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} {{environmental}} benefits of using recycled material, plastic ties usually replace timber ties soaked in creosote, the latter being a toxic chemical, and are themselves recyclable. Hybrid plastic railroad ties and composite ties are used in other rail applications such as <b>underground</b> <b>mining</b> <b>operations,</b> industrial zones, humid environments and densely populated areas. Hybrid railroad ties are also used to be partly exchanged with rotten wooden ties, which will result in continuous track stiffness. Hybrid plastic ties and composite ties also offer benefits on bridges and viaducts, because they lead to better distribution of forces and reduction of vibrations into respectively bridge girders or the ballast. This is due to better damping properties of hybrid plastic ties and composite ties, which will decrease the intensity of vibrations {{as well as the}} sound production.|$|E
