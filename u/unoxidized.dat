5|$|Cerro Blanco {{is part of}} the Central Volcanic Zone and {{is located}} at the {{southern}} limit of the Puna. It forms a volcanic unit together with the Aguada Alumbrera ignimbrite, at {{the eastern edge of the}} Cordillera de San Buenaventura. Rocks beneath this unit include dacitic–trachyandesitic volcanites 9–7 mya old and an igneous-metamorphic granitic basement containing orthogneiss, quartz of Neoproterozoic-early Paleozoic age, containing paleozoic mafic to ultramafic volcanic inclusions. The Cordillera de San Buenaventura is formed from lava domes and volcanic complexes of intermediary composition of Upper Miocene–Quaternary age. During the Miocene-Pleistocene, the isotope and chemical composition of areal magmas has moved away from arc like magmas to distinctly water-poor and <b>unoxidized</b> petrologies. This finding is consistent with a hot mantle forming after delamination of the crust and migration of the arc.|$|E
25|$|Through the centuries, {{a variety}} of {{techniques}} for processing tea, and a number of different forms of tea, were developed. During the Tang dynasty, tea was steamed, then pounded and shaped into cake form, while in the Song dynasty, loose-leaf tea was developed and became popular. During the Yuan and Ming dynasties, <b>unoxidized</b> tea leaves were first pan-fried, then rolled and dried, a process that stops the oxidation process that turns the leaves dark, thereby allowing tea to remain green. In the 15th century, oolong tea, in which the leaves were allowed to partially oxidize before pan-frying, was developed. Western tastes, however, favoured the fully oxidized black tea, and the leaves were allowed to oxidize further. Yellow tea was an accidental discovery in the production of green tea during the Ming dynasty, when apparently sloppy practices allowed the leaves to turn yellow, but yielded a different flavour as a result.|$|E

The product was centrifugated and re-dissolved in nitric acid. To separate berkelium from the unreacted americium, this solution {{was added to}} a mixture of ammonium and ammonium sulfate and heated to convert all the dissolved americium into the oxidation state +6. <b>Unoxidized</b> residual americium was precipitated {{by the addition of}} hydrofluoric acid as americium(III) fluoride (...) [...] This step yielded a mixture of the accompanying product curium and the expected element 97 in form of trifluorides. The mixture was converted to the corresponding hydroxides by treating it with potassium hydroxide, and after centrifugation, was dissolved in perchloric acid.|$|E

2500|$|Banded-iron sediments {{record the}} {{introduction}} of abundant free oxygen into earth's atmosphere. Microbial life {{played an important role}} in changing atmospheric conditions by releasing free oxygen as a waste product of photosynthesis. Free oxygen was taken up by elements with strong affinities for it [...] hydrogen, carbon and iron. Evidence for the change in oxygen levels is that the sediments of the earlier Archean are dark brown and black caused by <b>unoxidized</b> carbon, iron sulfide, and other elements and compounds. As oxygen levels increased in the atmosphere and oceans, the sediments changed. In the late Archean, sediments went through a transitional stage with the banded-iron formations; after this transition they demonstrate an oxygen-rich environment [...] shown by iron oxide-stained siltstones or mudstones called red beds.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{separation}} {{techniques such}} as milling, centrifugation, and pressing have enabled concentration of particular components of food, yielding flour, oils, juices, and so on, and even separate fatty acids, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals. Inevitably, such large-scale concentration changes the nutritional content of food, saving certain nutrients while removing others. Heating techniques may also reduce food's content of many heat-labile nutrients such as certain vitamins and phytochemicals, and possibly other yet-to-be-discovered substances. Because of reduced nutritional value, processed foods are often 'enriched' or 'fortified' {{with some of the}} most critical nutrients (usually certain vitamins) that were lost during processing. Nonetheless, processed foods tend to have an inferior nutritional profile compared to whole, fresh foods, regarding content of both sugar and high GI starches, potassium/sodium, vitamins, fiber, and of intact, <b>unoxidized</b> (essential) fatty acids.

60|$|Let us now {{suppose that}} the {{original}} agent or cause, instead of being instantaneous, is permanent. Whatever effect has been produced up to a given time, would (unless prevented by the intervention of some new cause) subsist permanently, even if the cause were to perish. Since, however, the cause does not perish, but continues to exist and to operate, it must go on producing {{more and more of}} the effect; and instead of a uniform effect, we have a progressive series of effects, arising from the accumulated influence of a permanent cause. Thus, the contact of iron with the atmosphere causes a portion of it to rust; and if the cause ceased, the effect already produced would be permanent, but no further effect would be added. If, however, the cause, namely, exposure to moist air, continues, {{more and more of the}} iron becomes rusted, until all which is exposed is converted into a red powder, when one of the conditions of the production of rust, namely, the presence of <b>unoxidized</b> iron, has ceased, and the effect can not any longer be produced. Again, the earth causes bodies to fall toward it; that is, the existence of the earth at a given instant causes an unsupported body to move toward it at the succeeding instant; and if the earth were annihilated, as much of the effect as is already produced would continue; the object would go on moving in the same direction, with its acquired velocity, until intercepted by some body or deflected by some other force. The earth, however, not being annihilated, goes on producing in the second instant an effect similar and of equal amount with the first, which two effects being added together, there results an accelerated velocity; and this operation being repeated at each successive instant, the mere permanence of the cause, though without increase, gives rise to a constant progressive increase of the effect, so long as all the conditions, negative and positive, of the production of that effect continue to be realized.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} events of the Proterozoic was the accumulation of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere.

Until roughly 2.3 billion years ago, oxygen was probably only 1% to 2% of its current level.

Their accumulation ceased after 1.9 billion years ago, after the iron in the oceans had all been oxidized.|$|E
