5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} can be {{dangerous}} if proper precautions are not taken. Since GMAW employs an electric arc, welders wear protective clothing, including heavy leather gloves and protective long sleeve jackets, to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. In addition, {{the brightness of the}} electric arc is a source of the condition known as arc eye, an inflammation of the cornea caused by ultraviolet light and, in prolonged exposure, possible burning of the retina in the eye. Conventional welding helmets contain dark face plates to prevent this exposure. Newer helmet designs feature a liquid crystal-type face plate that self-darken upon exposure to high amounts of <b>UV</b> <b>light.</b> Transparent welding curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, are often used to shield nearby workers and bystanders from exposure to the <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> from the electric arc.|$|E

Polymer versions of the banknote include two clear windows and other {{security features}} that substitute its paper version. Several features that are invisible {{to the naked eye}} appear when both versions of the banknote are exposed under <b>UV</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
5|$|SMAW welding, {{like other}} welding methods, {{can be a}} {{dangerous}} and unhealthy practice if proper precautions are not taken. The process uses an open electric arc, which presents a risk of burns which are prevented by personal protective equipment {{in the form of}} heavy leather gloves and long sleeve jackets. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area can lead to a condition called arc eye, in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Welding helmets with dark face plates are worn to prevent this exposure, and in recent years, new helmet models have been produced that feature a face plate that self-darkens upon exposure to high amounts of <b>UV</b> <b>light.</b> To protect bystanders, especially in industrial environments, translucent welding curtains often surround the welding area. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield nearby workers from exposure to the <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> from the electric arc, but should not be used to replace the filter glass used in helmets.|$|E
40|$|Although pikeperch is a {{promising}} species for intensive aquaculture and some experiments regarding all-female production in this species were made, {{there are no}} specifically data regarding genetical inactivation of pikeperch sperm. The {{aim of this study}} is to test two different <b>UV</b> <b>lights</b> (15 and 30 Watts) and exposure times of the diluted milt at UV irradiation for sperm genetical inactivation, in order to establish the first step in the gynogenesis protocol for pikeperch. The milt collected from 4 clinically health adult pikepearch males (3 - 4 years old) was diluted 1 : 9 with Ringer solution, after that being placed into Petri dishes (Ø = 3 cm) in a thin layer of 1 mm. Two <b>UV</b> <b>lights</b> (λ = 253. 7 nm) at 15 Watts (variant V 1) and 30 Watts (variant V 2) were used in our experiments. These were placed 20 cm above Petri dishes, and were established for each variant, 5 different periods for exposure to the irradiation: 8 min. (T 1), 11 min. (T 2), 14 min. (T 3), 17 min. (T 4) and 20 min. (T 5). The successful of irradiation was assessed by percent of fertilization (at 2 hours post fertilization), daily percent of survival, percent of hatching and percent of haploids (embryos/larvae with severely curved backbones and other deformities). After this study we could conclude that genetically inactivation of the pikeperch sperm can be performed with 15 Watts and 30 Watts <b>UV</b> <b>lights</b> at an exposure time which can vary between 8 and 20 minutes...|$|R

5|$|The urine of many rodents (e.g. voles, degus, mice, rats) {{strongly}} reflects <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> {{and this}} may be used in communication by leaving visible as well as olfactory markings. However, the amount of UV that is reflected decreases with time, which in some circumstances can be disadvantageous; the common kestrel can distinguish between old and fresh rodent trails and has greater success hunting over more recently marked routes.|$|E
5|$|Phosphorus {{could be}} {{intentionally}} introduced into diamond grown by {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) at concentrations up to ~0.01%. Phosphorus substitutes carbon in the diamond lattice. Similar to nitrogen, phosphorus has one more electron than carbon and thus acts as a donor; however, the ionization energy of phosphorus (0.6 eV) is much smaller than that of nitrogen (1.7 eV) and is small enough for room-temperature thermal ionization. This important property of phosphorus in diamond favors electronic applications, such as <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> emitting diodes (LEDs, at 235nm).|$|E
5|$|The Earth's {{atmosphere}} {{is a key}} factor in sustaining the ecosystem. The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by gravity. Air is mostly nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, etc. The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude. The ozone layer {{plays an important role in}} depleting the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As DNA is readily damaged by <b>UV</b> <b>light,</b> this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to store papyri within a climate-controlled room in which the temperature and humidity are maintained at a constant level of 17-23 degrees Celsius and 50-60 percent, respectively.

5|$|The {{absence of}} {{physical}} dividers between the sites occupied by individual oligonucleotides, {{a very limited}} space {{on the surface of}} the microarray (one oligonucleotide sequence occupies a square 25×25μm) and the requirement of high fidelity of oligonucleotide synthesis dictate the use of site-selective 5'-deprotection techniques. In one approach, the removal of the 5'-O-DMT group is effected by electrochemical generation of the acid at the required site(s). Another approach uses 5'-O-(α-methyl-6-nitropiperonyloxycarbonyl) (MeNPOC) protecting group, which can be removed by irradiation with <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> of 365nm wavelength.|$|E
5|$|Welding can be {{dangerous}} and unhealthy if the proper precautions are not taken. However, using new technology and proper protection greatly reduces risks of injury and death associated with welding. Since many common welding procedures involve an open electric arc or flame, the risk of burns and fire is significant; {{this is why it}} is classified as a hot work process. To prevent injury, welders wear personal protective equipment in the form of heavy leather gloves and protective long-sleeve jackets to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area leads to a condition called arc eye or flash burns in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Goggles and welding helmets with dark UV-filtering face plates are worn to prevent this exposure. Since the 2000s, some helmets have included a face plate which instantly darkens upon exposure to the intense <b>UV</b> <b>light.</b> To protect bystanders, the welding area is often surrounded with translucent welding curtains. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield people outside the welding area from the <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> of the electric arc, but can not replace the filter glass used in helmets.|$|E
5|$|Formation of the {{complexes}} of {{the type}} Cm(n-C3H7-BTP)3, where BTP stands for 2,6-di(1,2,4-triazin-3-yl)pyridine, in solutions containing n-C3H7-BTP and Cm3+ ions has been confirmed by EXAFS. Some of these BTP-type complexes selectively interact with curium and therefore are useful in its selective separation from lanthanides and another actinides. Dissolved Cm3+ ions bind with many organic compounds, such as hydroxamic acid, urea, fluorescein and adenosine triphosphate. Many of these compounds are related to biological activity of various microorganisms. The resulting complexes exhibit strong yellow-orange emission under <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> excitation, which is convenient not only for their detection, but also for studying the interactions between the Cm3+ ion and the ligands via changes in the half-life (of the order ~0.1 ms) and spectrum of the fluorescence.|$|E

When alcohol-based dyes are exposed to sunlight, the color either lightens or fades out completely. Therefore, alcohol-based dyes were more prevalent in interior applications where direct sunlight or other forms of ultraviolet (<b>UV)</b> <b>lighting</b> was not present.|$|R
40|$|Institutional {{tuberculosis}} (TB) {{transmission is}} an important public health problem highlighted by the HIV/AIDS pandemic {{and the emergence of}} multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant TB. Effective TB infection control measures are urgently needed. We evaluated the efficacy of upperroom ultraviolet (<b>UV)</b> <b>lights</b> and negative air ionization for preventing airborne TB transmission using a guinea pig air-sampling model to measure the TB infectiousness of ward air. Methods and Findings For 535 consecutive days, exhaust air from an HIV-TB ward in Lima, Peru´, was passed through three guinea pig air-sampling enclosures each housing approximately 150 guinea pigs, using a 2 -d cycle. On UV-off days, ward air passed in parallel through a control animal enclosure and a similar enclosure containing negative ionizers. On UV-on days, <b>UV</b> <b>lights</b> and mixing fans were turned on in the ward, and a third animal enclosure alone received ward air. TB infection in guinea pigs was defined by monthly tuberculin skin tests. All guinea pigs underwent autopsy to test for TB disease, defined by characteristic autopsy changes or by the culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from organs. 35...|$|R
25|$|Ultraviolet <b>light</b> (<b>UV)</b> is very {{effective}} at inactivating cysts, in low turbidity water. <b>UV</b> <b>light's</b> disinfection effectiveness decreases as turbidity increases, {{a result of}} the absorption, scattering, and shadowing caused by the suspended solids. The main disadvantage to the use of UV radiation is that, like ozone treatment, it leaves no residual disinfectant in the water; therefore, it is sometimes necessary to add a residual disinfectant after the primary disinfection process. This is often done through the addition of chloramines, discussed above as a primary disinfectant. When used in this manner, chloramines provide an effective residual disinfectant with very few of the negative effects of chlorination.|$|R
5|$|Alkanes and aryl alkanes may be {{chlorinated}} under {{free radical}} conditions, with <b>UV</b> <b>light.</b> However, {{the extent of}} chlorination is difficult to control: the reaction is not regioselective and often results {{in a mixture of}} various isomers with different degrees of chlorination, though this may be permissible if the products are easily separated. Aryl chlorides may be prepared by the Friedel-Crafts halogenation, using chlorine and a Lewis acid catalyst. The haloform reaction, using chlorine and sodium hydroxide, is also able to generate alkyl halides from methyl ketones, and related compounds. Chlorine adds to the multiple bonds on alkenes and alkynes as well, giving di- or tetra-chloro compounds. However, due to the expense and reactivity of chlorine, organochlorine compounds are more commonly produced by using hydrogen chloride, or with chlorinating agents such as phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) or thionyl chloride (SOCl2). The last is very convenient in the laboratory because all side products are gaseous and {{do not have to be}} distilled out.|$|E
5|$|Humans, horses, and orangutans {{are among}} the few species that may grow their head hair very long. Humans are {{believed}} to have lost their fur 2.5–3 million years ago as hominids when transitioning from a forest habitat to the open savanna, as an effect of natural selection, since this development made it possible to run fast and hunt animals close to the equator without getting overheated. An exception was however head hair, which was kept to provide thermal insulation of the scalp from the sun, to protect against ultra-violet radiation exposure, and also to provide cooling (when sweat evaporates from soaked hair). The ability to grow straight hair, has been observed among Homo sapiens sub-groups in less sunny regions further away from the equator. Relative to kinky Afro-textured hair, straight hair allows more <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> to pass to the scalp (which is essential for the production of vitamin D, that is important for bone development).|$|E
5|$|Synthetic diamond has {{potential}} uses as a semiconductor, {{because it can}} be doped with impurities like boron and phosphorus. Since these elements contain one more or one less valence electron than carbon, they turn synthetic diamond into p-type or n-type semiconductor. Making a p–n junction by sequential doping of synthetic diamond with boron and phosphorus produces light-emitting diodes (LEDs) producing <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> of 235nm. Another useful property of synthetic diamond for electronics is high carrier mobility, which reaches 4500cm2/(V·s) for electrons in single-crystal CVD diamond. High mobility is favourable for high-frequency operation and field-effect transistors made from diamond have already demonstrated promising high-frequency performance above 50GHz. The wide band gap of diamond (5.5 eV) gives it excellent dielectric properties. Combined with the high mechanical stability of diamond, those properties are being used in prototype high-power switches for power stations.|$|E
