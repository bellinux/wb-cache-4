5|$|About a {{year after}} the accident, a monument—a large white cross with an {{attached}} nameplate—was erected on the spot of the crash site to commemorate the victims of LANSA flight 502. In 2006, because of encroaching development, the Peruvian owner of the land where the memorial was originally located, <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Senator from New York, Charles E. Schumer, the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Consulate General in Peru, agreed to relocate the memorial 150 feet away to protect the site.|$|E
5|$|Moscoso {{worked to}} end Panama's role in {{international}} crime, passing new laws against money laundering and supporting tax transparency. The legislation allowed Panama {{to be removed}} from international lists of tax havens. Meanwhile, violent crime rose sharply during Moscoso's tenure. In September 2000, <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> US and some Latin American governments, Moscoso's government gave temporary asylum to former Peruvian spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos, who had fled Peru after being videotaped bribing a member of its congress.|$|E
5|$|Nhất Hạnh {{moved to}} France {{and became the}} chair of the Vietnamese Buddhist Peace Delegation. When the Northern Vietnamese army took control of the south in 1975, he was denied {{permission}} to return to Vietnam. From 1976–1977 he led efforts to help rescue Vietnamese boat people in the Gulf of Siam, eventually stopping <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> governments of Thailand and Singapore.|$|E
50|$|In April, Mosaddegh was {{selected}} as prime minister by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi <b>under</b> immense <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Majlis.|$|R
5000|$|Ahead of {{the launch}} of the 2009 World Energy Outlook, the British daily {{newspaper}} The Guardian, referring to an unidentified senior IEA official, alleged that the agency was deliberately downplaying the risk of peak oil <b>under</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> USA. According to a second unidentified former senior IEA official it was [...] "imperative not to anger the Americans" [...] and that the world has already entered the [...] "peak oil zone".|$|R

5|$|When the Lewis and Clark Expedition {{reached the}} Platte in 1804, {{they found the}} Kitkehahkis (whom they mistakenly called Arapahos) living there. They {{were told that the}} band had {{returned}} to the Republican about ten years before (that is, before the conflict with the Omahas), but had recently moved to the Platte <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Kanzas. By 1806, however, the Kitkehahkis were at peace with the Kanzas, and were once again living on the Republican.|$|E
5|$|According to the Constitution of 1831, the Belgian {{government}} {{was allowed to}} override {{the wishes of the}} King if he had been declared incompetent to reign. On 28 May 1940, <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> French government, the Pierlot government in France declared the King to be under the power of the invaders and unfit to reign according to article 82, providing strong legal foundations and making itself the only official source of government. The government, however, refused to declare a republic. Although the King technically remained the only person able to receive diplomatic legations and conclude treaties, the government in exile was able to do both during the war independently.|$|E
5|$|As of 2016, the Nobel Prize in Literature {{has been}} awarded to 113 individuals. When he {{received}} the award in 1958, Russian-born Boris Pasternak was forced to publicly reject the award <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> government of the Soviet Union. In 1964, Jean-Paul Sartre made known {{that he did not}} wish to accept the Nobel Prize in Literature, as he had consistently refused all official honors in the past. However the Nobel committee does not acknowledge refusals, and includes Pasternak and Sartre in its list of Nobel laureates.|$|E

5|$|Cornelius had no {{luck with}} the MacLean leadership, who {{remained}} Episcopalian, but the (small) population of Rùm does appear to have become Roman Catholic again. In {{the rest of the}} nation, Covenanters gradually gained political control. Coll (along with the lands of the MacLeans of Duart) was under the shrieval authority of the sheriff of Argyll; <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Earl of Argyll, {{one of the most powerful}} Covenanter leaders, shrieval authority over Rùm was transferred from Inverness to the Argyll sheriff, which was under the control of the Earl's family.|$|E
5|$|For much of 2009 and 2010, China was <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> US {{to allow}} the yuan to appreciate. Between June and October 2010, China allowed a 2% appreciation, but there were {{concerns}} from Western observers that China only relaxed its intervention when under heavy pressure. The fixed peg was not abandoned until just before the June G20 meeting, after which the yuan appreciated by about 1%, only to devalue slowly again, until further US pressure in September when it again appreciated relatively steeply, {{just prior to the}} September US Congressional hearings to discuss measures to force a revaluation.|$|E
5|$|In 1808, Napoleon and Czar Alexander {{met at the}} Congress of Erfurt to {{preserve}} the Russo-French alliance. The leaders had a friendly personal relationship after their first meeting at Tilsit in 1807. By 1811, however, tensions had increased and Alexander was <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Russian nobility to break off the alliance. A major strain {{on the relationship between}} the two nations became the regular violations of the Continental System by the Russians, which led Napoleon to threaten Alexander with serious consequences if he formed an alliance with Britain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Under</b> immense <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{judiciary}} the Government set up {{a secret}} three man Commission of inquiry headed by the President of the Supreme Court Moshe Landau.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Under</b> {{increasing}} <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> KGB {{authorities for}} his literary [...] "deviations," [...] he emigrated from Lithuania to Israel in 1972 {{where he lived}} until his death.|$|R
50|$|The {{city was}} {{originally}} named Ellensburgh, {{until the final}} -h was dropped <b>under</b> standardization <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> United States Postal Service and Board of Geography Names in 1894.|$|R
5|$|In June 1970, Nasser {{accepted}} the US-sponsored Rogers Plan, {{which called for}} an end to hostilities and an Israeli withdrawal from Egyptian territory, but it was rejected by Israel, the PLO, and most Arab states except Jordan. Nasser had initially rejected the plan, but conceded <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union, which feared that escalating regional conflict could drag it into a war with the US. He also determined that a ceasefire could serve as a tactical step toward the strategic goal of recapturing the Suez Canal. Nasser forestalled any movement toward direct negotiations with Israel. In dozens of speeches and statements, Nasser posited the equation that any direct peace talks with Israel were tantamount to surrender.|$|E
5|$|In Nova Covert Ops, Valerian {{has been}} <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Defenders of Man, who oppose his rule. Valerian {{questions}} Nova {{when she returned}} to the Dominion after being missing for some time. Valerian believes her claim, that she didn't betray the Dominion and grants her her own covert ops team to discover what the Defenders of Man are up to. After Nova learns, that the Defenders are using psi emitters to lure zerg to Dominion Worlds to discredit him, and learning the identity of their leader, General Davis, Valerian contacts her and announces his wish to step down as the Emperor of the Dominion.|$|E
5|$|Later, again <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> plebs, a {{political}} compromise was reached {{in which the}} consuls and tribunes would give place to a commission of ten men, the decemviri, who would be empowered to publish a code of laws for all Rome. According to Livy, it codified all public and private law, but however, its promulgation did not grant further political rights to the plebs, as it enshired into the tables a law banning intermarriage between plebeians and patricians. With a short attempt to establish a tyranny by the decemviri, they were overthrown by the second secession of the army, restoring the old republic and preventing {{the creation of a}} new constitution based on the ten-man commission.|$|E
50|$|Fossil water {{aquifers}} {{can also}} be artesian if they are <b>under</b> sufficient <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> surrounding rocks. This is similar to how many newly tapped oil wells are pressurized.|$|R
50|$|Mauss and {{his wife}} were cleared on all {{accounts}} (known as Preclusión in Colombian Law). The Colombian court, <b>under</b> diplomatic <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> German government, had declared the arrest illegal.|$|R
50|$|The therapsids came <b>under</b> {{increasing}} <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dinosaurs in the Jurassic; the {{mammals and}} the tritylodontids {{were the only}} survivors of the line {{by the end of}} the period.|$|R
5|$|On 14 April, <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 14th Panzer Division, {{remnants}} of the 4th Army continued to withdraw towards Sarajevo via Jajce and Travnik. The cadet battalion at Ključ managed to briefly delay the German advance through Mrkonjić Grad, but were overcome by tanks and air attacks. The bridge at Jajce was demolished at 23:15, and Nedeljković withdrew his headquarters to Travnik. The remaining units of the 4th Army continued to disintegrate. The vanguard of the northern column of 14th Panzer Division surged forward to Teslić, with the central column only reaching Jajce.|$|E
5|$|On December 17, Sony {{canceled}} the New York City premiere. Later that day, other major theater chains including AMC, Cinemark, Cineplex, Regal and Southern Theatres either delayed or canceled screenings of the film. The chains reportedly came <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> malls where many theaters are located, which {{feared that the}} terror threat would harm their holiday sales. They also feared expensive lawsuits {{in the event of}} an attack; Cinemark, for instance, contended that it could not have foreseen the 2012 Aurora shooting, which took place at one of its multiplexes, a defense that would not hold {{in the event of an}} attack at a screening of The Interview.|$|E
5|$|Prince Sihanouk was {{surprisingly}} acquiescent {{about the whole}} affair. He was <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> U.S. to reopen diplomatic ties and to act militarily against the sanctuaries; from the North Vietnamese, who now received 80 percent of their supplies for their southernmost operations through Sihanoukville; and from the fledgling Chinese-supported Khmer Rouge (approximately 4,000 men). Sihanouk {{felt that this was}} a propitious moment to swing back to the right. By the summer he created a right-wing Government of National Salvation under General Lon Nol and he suspended DRV arms shipments through his ports.|$|E
50|$|In 1456, <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> Philip <b>the</b> Good, Heinsberg {{resigned}} {{in favour of}} Louis de Bourbon. He died at Kuringen, near Hasselt, on 18 October 1459, leaving a reputation for luxury and magnificence.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the record}} turnout for the anniversary vigil, and <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> students, <b>the</b> Chinese University {{administration}} acquiesced in allowing the statue a 'temporary home' near the Chinese University exit of the MTR University Station.|$|R
25|$|In 1917, <b>under</b> growing <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other {{partners}} in the firm due to his pro-German stance, Henry Goldman resigned. Control of the firm was {{now in the hands}} of the Sachs family.|$|R
5|$|Residents left {{homeless}} by {{the massacre}} were given shelter in relief camps {{constructed by the}} state government. On 16 March 2002, the state government formed an all-party committee consisting of 13 member and chaired by Bhandari to provide relief and rehabilitation {{to the victims of}} the riots. Modi proposed to close the camps by the end of March but later decided not to close them. <b>Under</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> opposition party, the Indian National Congress, the all-party committee reached a consensus to implement rehabilitation measures suggested by various non-governmental organisations which were to aid people to build houses.|$|E
5|$|The French {{defenders}} of the town, despite initially resisting the attack, were unable to prevent the seizure of the port's defensive fortifications. The British force later withdrew <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> main garrison of the island, burning warehouses containing over £500,000 worth of silk captured from British merchant ships. Ultimately the French were unable to effectively oppose the invasion, the island's governor General Des Bruslys retreating to Saint-Denis rather than engage the British and later committing suicide. The transportation of forces from the recently captured island of Rodrigues, the co-ordination of land and naval forces {{and the failure of}} the French defenders to co-ordinate an effective response were all features of the subsequent invasion and capture of Île Bonaparte in July 1810.|$|E
5|$|The bombing {{caused a}} major outcry {{throughout}} the world, and the Irish and British governments introduced new legislation {{in an attempt}} to destroy the organisation. The RIRA also came <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Provisional IRA, when Provisional IRA members visited the homes of 60 people connected with the RIRA and ordered them to disband and stop interfering with Provisional IRA arms dumps. With the organisation under intense pressure, which included McKevitt and Sands-McKevitt being forced from their home after the media named McKevitt in connection with the bombing, the RIRA called a ceasefire on 8 September.|$|E
50|$|The {{departure}} of Keegan <b>from</b> <b>the</b> club, on 4 September, saw Wise, Jimenez (who left the club on 9 October) and club owner Ashley come <b>under</b> mounting <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> club's supporters to quit.|$|R
5000|$|Former Paris SG {{shareholder}} Canal+ was {{the first}} to replace the iconic crest in 1994. The new model had the acronym [...] "PSG" [...] and underneath it [...] "Paris Saint-Germain."

25|$|Later on, <b>under</b> {{increasing}} <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman Empire, further residual territories {{were lost}} and re-organised until only Istria, Dalmatia, Corfu and the Ionian Islands (Venetian Ionian Islands) were left when the Republic fell to Napoleon in 1797.|$|R
