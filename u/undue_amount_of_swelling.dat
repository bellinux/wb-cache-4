40|$|Heat-treatment, a {{major method}} of wood {{modification}} for improving dimensional stability and natural durability, {{has been studied}} considerably in the scientific literature. This study {{will focus on the}} effect of heat-treatment on permeability, an important physical property of wood by subjecting beech samples to two different mediums of hot water and steam, as well as in two buffered hot water of pH 7 and 8. Hydrothermal treatment caused gas permeability to decrease to its lowest value among the treatments (91. 6 % decrease comparing the control treatment). Hydrothermal treatment in buffered hot water of pH 8 made the lowest impact on gas permeability (12. 3 % decrease). The decrease in gas permeability was due to settlement of extractives on vessel perforation plates. Gas permeability showed a highly significant correlation with the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> in radial direction. Low correlation was found between liquid permeability with water absorption and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>swelling.</b> Gas permeability is considered a suitable criterion for predicting the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> in beech wood...|$|R

40|$|A {{method of}} testing {{explosive}} and pyrotechnic devices involves exploding the devices inside swell sleeves. Swell sleeves have been used previously for measuring forces. In the present method, {{they are used to}} obtain quantitative indications of the energy released in explosions of the devices under test. A swell sleeve is basically a thick-walled, hollow metal cylinder threaded at one end to accept a threaded surface on a device to be tested (see Figure 1). Once the device has been tightly threaded in place in the swell sleeve, the device-and-swell-sleeve assembly is placed in a test fixture, then the device is detonated. After the explosion, the assembly is removed from the test fixture and placed in a coordinate-measuring machine for measurement of the diameter of the swell sleeve as a function of axial position. For each axial position, the original diameter of the sleeve is subtracted from the diameter of the sleeve as swollen by the explosion to obtain the diametral swelling as a function of axial position (see Figure 2). The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> is taken as a measure of the energy released in the explosion. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> can be compared to a standard <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> to determine whether the pyrotechnic device functioned as specified...|$|R

30|$|In this study, to {{summarize}} the changes of thermal-softening behaviors of wood and acetylated wood {{due to differences in}} the kinds <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> liquids, the following measurements were conducted. Untreated and acetylated wood samples were swollen by various liquids and the temperature dependences of the dynamic viscoelastic properties were measured after the heating and cooling histories were unified among the samples. The results obtained are as follows. Untreated samples swollen by high-polarity liquid had lower peak temperature of tanδ, however acetylated samples had higher peak temperature of tanδ than those of untreated wood. On the other hand, untreated wood samples swollen by low-polarity liquid had higher peak temperature of tanδ, however acetylated samples had lower peak temperature of tanδ than those of untreated wood. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> is determined by interaction between wood and liquid due to proton-accepting power and molar volumes of liquid and so on, therefore the peak temperature of tanδ and degree of reduction in dynamic elastic modulus (E´) with increasing temperature were corresponded to the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>swelling.</b>|$|R

This index provides information about the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> clays that the rock contains, as the types of clays are known from XRD analyses. CEC analyses were performed on selected cutting samples from the GRT- 2 well to quantify the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> clays (Fig.  2). The measurement was performed on crushed cuttings with the standard cobaltihexamine chloride method NF X 31 – 130 (1999). Calcimetry was performed on samples from both wells during the drilling and provided information about the relative <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> calcite, dolomite, or total carbonates in the cutting samples (Fig.  3). More precisely, the use of a calcimeter on the crushed and dried cuttings measures the quantity of CO 2 released by the reaction of the carbonates with HCl. The quantity of CO 2 released after 1  min gives the percentage of calcite, and the quantity of CO 2 released after 15  min gives the percentage of total carbonates. The difference between the total carbonate quantity and the calcite quantity is the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> dolomite. The two superimposed curves reveal that only calcite is present in the granitic sections of the GRT- 1 and GRT- 2 wells.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{introduce}} the Cohesive Energy Density (CED) method, a multiple sampling Molecular Dynamics computer simulation procedure that may offer higher {{consistency in the}} estimation of Hildebrand and Hansen solubility parameters. The use of a multiple sampling technique, combined with a simple but consistent molecular force field and quantum mechanically determined atomic charges, allows for the precise determination of solubility parameters in a systematic way (0. 4 hildebrands). The CED method yields first-principles Hildebrand parameter predictions in good agreement with experiment [root-mean-square (rms) 1. 1 hildebrands]. We apply the CED method to model the Caltech electronic nose, an array of 20 polymer sensors. Sensors are built with conducting leads connected through thin-film polymers loaded with carbon black. Odorant detection relies on a change in electric resistivity of the polymer film as function <b>of</b> the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> caused by the odorant compound. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> depends upon the chemical composition of the polymer and the odorant molecule. The pattern is unique, and unambiguously identifies the compound.

40|$|Excavating {{the ground}} which {{consists}} of the marine deposits formed during Neogen and/or Quaternary period, the acid sulfate soil occasionally appears on the execution basis. As this soil includes sulfuric acid produced with the oxidation of sulfide, the growth of plants is disturbed and it becomes difficult to improve the soil by adding a stabilizer. In general, the calcic materials such as stone powder and zeolite have been employed to neutralize the acid sulfate soil from the past. Therefore, the shells which are composed mainly of a calcium carbonate {{can also be considered}} to be useful as a material for the neutralization process. We have ascertained the stabilization effect due to the using of crushed oyster shell by comparing the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> and CBR value for soil-stabilizer-shell mixture with those for soil-stabilizer mixture.

TDXML also enables keyed access to individual elements to enable single pass message parsing for improved object serialisation and deserialisation. Experimental studies show that TDXML can be incorporated easily into a commercially available SOAP implementation with 30 % improved latency performance.
