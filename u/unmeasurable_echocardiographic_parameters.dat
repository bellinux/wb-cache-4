BackgroundMeasurement of myocardial deformation by 2 -dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography, specifically GLS, may be superior to conventional <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>parameters,</b> including left ventricular ejection fraction, in predicting all-cause mortality in HFrEF patients. MethodsTransthoracic echocardiographic examinations were retrieved for 1, 065 HFrEF patients admitted to a heart failure clinic. The echocardiographic images were analyzed, and conventional and novel <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>parameters</b> were obtained. ResultsMany of the conventional <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>parameters</b> proved to be predictors of mortality. However, GLS remained an independent predictor of mortality in the multivariable model after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, total cholesterol, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, ischemic cardiomyopathy, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus, and conventional <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>parameters</b> (hazard ratio [HR]: 1. 15; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 04 to 1. 27; p = 0. 008, per 1 % decrease). No other <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>parameter</b> remained an independent predictor after adjusting for these variables. Furthermore, GLS had the highest C-statistics of all the <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>parameters</b> and added incremental prognostic value with a significant increase in the net reclassification improvement (p = 0. 009). Atrial fibrillation (AF) modified the relationship between GLS and mortality (p value for interaction = 0. 036); HR: 1. 08 (95 % CI: 0. 97 to 1. 19), p = 0. 150 and HR: 1. 22 (95 % CI: 1. 15 to 1. 29), p < 0. 001, per 1 % decrease in GLS for patients with and without AF, respectively. Sex also modified the relationship between GLS and mortality (p value for interaction = 0. 047); HR: 1. 23 (95 % CI: 1. 16 to 1. 30), p < 0. 001 and HR: 1. 09 (95 % CI: 0. 99 to 1. 20), p = 0. 083, per 1 % decrease in GLS for men and women, respectively.

40|$|Background: Cardiovascular {{problems}} including arterial hypertension, {{coronary artery}} diseases, {{congestive heart failure}} are prevalent among chronic hemodialyzed patients. Ultrafiltration of hemodialyzed patient's serum, which culminating in intravascular volume reduction, is frequently used during hemodialysis. One of the restrictions of the echocardiographic evaluation of the diastolic heart function is the intravascular volume dependency of some <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>parameters.</b> In this study we have evaluated the volume dependency of certain echocardiography parameters in chronically hemodialyzed patients. Methods: Thirteen patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis in Ghaem Hospital Hemodialysis Center in Mashhad, Iran, were evaluated one hour before and immediately after hemodialysis for the following: all diastolic <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>parameters,</b> left ventricular function, left ventricular systolic function, inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter and IVC collapsibility with inspiration, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>parameters</b> were analyzed using the paired Student's t-test. Results: With hemodialysis, {{there was no significant}} change in left ventricular function, A wave amplitude and E/F slope, however, there was a significant reduction of the E wave amplitude, increment in E wave deceleration time (p= 0. 001, t=- 4. 14) and a decrease in the E/A ratio (p= 0. 03, t= 2. 46). Tissue Doppler echocardiography showed no significant change in mitral annular diastolic motion, E'/A' waves, with hemodialysis (p= 0. 728, t= - 0. 356), although there was a reduction of the E/E' ratio. Conclusion: Tissue Doppler imaging and color M-mode <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>parameters</b> are independent of the intravascular value status. With no change associated with hemodialysis, these parameters can be used as reliable criteria for evaluating ventricular diastolic function even when the volume status varies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hekmat R. * 1 "nTalebi S. 2 "nMohebati.

In a prospective, multicenter setting, the Predictors of Response to CRT (PROSPECT) study tested the performance of these parameters to predict CRT response. Methods and Results-Fifty-three centers in Europe, Hong Kong, and the United States enrolled 498 patients with standard CRT indications (New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction = 130 ms, stable medical regimen). Twelve <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>parameters</b> of dyssynchrony, based on both conventional and tissue Doppler-based methods, were evaluated after site training in acquisition methods and blinded core laboratory analysis. Indicators of positive CRT response were improved clinical composite score and >= 15 % reduction in left ventricular end-systolic volume at 6 months. Clinical composite score was improved in 69 % of 426 patients, whereas left ventricular end-systolic volume decreased >= 15 % in 56 % of 286 patients with paired data. The ability of the 12 <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>parameters</b> to predict clinical composite score response varied widely, with sensitivity ranging from 6 % to 74 % and specificity ranging from 35 % to 91 %; for predicting left ventricular end-systolic volume response, sensitivity ranged from 9 % to 77 % and specificity from 31 % to 93 %. For all the parameters, the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve for positive clinical or volume response to CRT was <= 0. 62.

The present study was therefore designed to identify the cut-off values of <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>parameters</b> of severity in normal flow (NF) AS corresponding to a Vmax ≥ 3 m/s, ≥ 4 m/s, 5 m/s or 5. 50 m/s. This study was therefore designed to identify the cut-off values of <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>parameters</b> of severity that correspond to Vmax≥ 3, 4, 5 and 5. 5 m/s. Methods and resultsWe retrospectively reviewed the echocardiograms of 528 consecutive patients with AS, left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction> 0. 50 and NF (stroke volume index> 35 mL/m 2. The accuracy of mean pressure gradient (MPG), aortic valve area (AVA), and indexed AVA for BSA (IAVA) to predict Vmax≥ 3, 4, 5 and 5. 5 m/s ranged from 0. 89 to 0. 99, and the best predictor was MPG for various levels of Vmax. The best values of MPG, AVA, and IAVA to predict Vmax≥ 3 m/s were 22 mmHg, 1. 15 cm 2, 0. 60 cm 2 /m 2, respectively. While a cut-off of Vmax≥ 4 m/s to define severe AS was consistent with a value of 39 mmHg for MPG, corresponding values for AVA and IAVA of 0. 90 cm 2 and 0. 48 cm 2 /m 2 respectively were substantially different from those recommended in current guidelines. MPG≥ 60 and 65 mmHg, AVA≤ 0. 76 and ≤ 0. 68 cm 2, and IAVA≤ 0. 41 and ≤ 0. 35 cm 2 /m 2 were identified as predictors of Vmax≥ 5 m/s and ≥ 5. 5 m/s (very severe AS), respectively. ConclusionsGuidelines recommended cut-off values for AVA and IAVA are not {{consistent with those of}} Vmax and MPG. The {{results of the present study}} may serve as safeguards in case of apparent inconsistencies between <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>parameters</b> of severity in NF AS...|$|R
40|$|An {{increased}} {{incidence of}} coeliac disease {{has recently been}} reported in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy This report deals with three patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and coeliac disease who underwent clinical and laboratory evaluation to establish {{the effect of a}} gluten-free diet on cardiac performance. Two patients observed the gluten-free diet regimen very strictly, and, after a 28 -month follow-up period, showed an improvement in <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>parameters</b> as well as in cardiological features and quality of life, as evaluated by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire and the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale questionnaire. The third patient did not observe the gluten-free diet and presented a worsening in the <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>parameters</b> and cardiological symptoms which required supplementary drug therapy These preliminary data appear to suggest that the gluten-free diet may have a beneficial effect on cardiac performance in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy...|$|R
40|$|In 23 {{patients}} with Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve, the functional {{class of the}} patients has been related to the <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>parameters</b> generally used to diagnose this disorder. These are the extent of apical displacement of the tricuspid valve and the delay in tricuspid valve closure time related {{to that of the}} mitral valve. In addition, the functional class of the patients has also been evaluated in relation to the severity of tricuspid valve insufficiency and to {{the presence or absence of}} associated cardiac abnormalities. The study revealed that the <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>parameters</b> i. e. the degree of apical displacement of the tricuspid valve and the delayed closure time of the tricuspid valve have no predictive value for the patient's clinical condition. On the other hand, both tricuspid valve insufficiency and the presence of additional anomalies have a direct correlation with the well-being of the patien...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background: Cardiotoxicity is an {{important}} side effect of trastuzumab therapy and cardiac surveillance is recommended. Objectives: The aim of our study was to prospectively assess baseline patients' characteristics, level of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>parameters</b> as possible predictors of trastuzumab-related cardiac dysfunction. Methods: In a prospective cohort study, clinical, echocardiographic and neurohumoral assessment was performed at baseline, after 4, 8 and 12 months in breast cancer patients undergoing post-anthracycline (3 - 4 cycles) adjuvant therapy with trastuzumab. Trastuzumab-related cardiac dysfunction {{was defined as a}} decline of &# 8805; 10 % in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Results: 92 patients (mean age, 53. 6 ± 9. 0 years) were included. Patients who developed trastuzumab-related LVEF decline &# 8805; 10 % (20. 6 %) during treatment had significantly higher baseline LVEF (70. 7 ± 4. 4 %) than those without (64. 8 ± 5. 5 %) (p = 0. 0035). All other measured baseline parameters (age, body mass index, arterial hypertension, level of NT-proBNP and other <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>parameters)</b> were not identified as significant. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that baseline patient' characteristics, level of NT-proBNP and <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>parameters,</b> {{as long as they are}} within normal range, are not a reliable tool to predict early trastuzumab-related cardiac dysfunction in patients undergoing post-low dose anthracycline adjuvant trastuzumab therapy. A LVEF decline in patients with high-normal baseline level although statistically significant is not clinically relevant...|$|R
40|$|Left {{ventricular}} hypertrophy {{is associated}} withincreased mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Syndecan- 4 {{plays a role}} in many processes that are involved in the heart fibrosis and hypertrophy. We designed this study to prospectively determine whether syndecan- 4 was predictive of mortality in a group of HD patients. In total, 191 HD patients were included. Clinical, biochemical and <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>parameters</b> were recorded. HD patients were followed-up for 23. 18 ± 4. 02 months. Syndecan- 4 levels correlated strongly with geometrical <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>parameters</b> and ejection fraction. Relations with pressure-related parameters were weak and only marginally significant. Using the receiver operating characteristics the optimal cut-off points in predicting all-cause as well as cardiovascular (CV) mortality were evaluated and patients were divided into low and high syndecan- 4 groups. A Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the cumulative incidences of all-cause as well as CV mortality were higher in high serum syndecan- 4 group compared with those with low serum syndecan- 4 (p< 0. 001 in both cases). A multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed syndecan- 4 concentration to be an independent and significant predictor of all-cause (hazard ratio, 2. 99; confidence interval, 2. 34 to 3. 113; p< 0. 001) as well as CV mortality (hazard ratio, 2. 81;confidence interval, 2. 28 to 3. 02; p< 0. 001). Serum syndecan- 4 concentration reflects predominantly geometrical <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>parameters.</b> In HD patients serum syndecan- 4 concentration is independently associated with all-cause as well as CV mortality...|$|R
