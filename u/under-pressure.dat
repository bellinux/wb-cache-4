50|$|Process: The {{evaporation}} surface (1) suctions {{water out}} of the capillary basin (6), puts the capillary pump (8) for the flooding process in action and quickly fills the surface from top to bottom. Then it drips into the catch basin (2). The water evaporates and sets the air circulation into motion. The drained water closes the hose (3) below. Here, air which flows via pipe into the water tank (5) is interrupted. The water in the tank can no longer flow out because <b>under-pressure</b> occurs. The residual water in the capillary basin (6), on the upper part, is evaporated by the evaporation surface (1). The residual water in the catch basin (2), on the bottom, is suctioned out by the lime separator (7) and evaporated. As soon as the catch basin is empty, air then flows again through the hose (3); water from the tank flows back to the capillary basins (6) and thereby begins the process again. The alternating filling levels for the catch and capillary basins suppress the creation of germs.|$|E

Conventional "slug " and constant-rate injection tests were made below a hydraulic packer set at various depths in the hole. The packer was first set in a massive flow unit 37 meters below the sediment/basement interface.

Vitrinite reflectance values are also similar, although the coals at Corbett Creek are situated about 300 m shallower, which points to a rank excursion from Hilt's burial law curves at Corbett Creek. Coals from both areas are within the “oil window”. The Medicine River Seam in the Fenn area has higher total inertinite content and greater proportions of inertodetrinite and detrovitrinite, suggesting that peat deposition occurred in swamps and marshes and were prone to periodic flooding. At Corbett Creek, the Mannville coal seams are characterized by greater concentrations of telo-inertinite, which contributes to coal meso-porosity and the potential for free gas storage in the open cell lumens, and to an increased gas flow along lithotype boundaries (horizontal permeability). Non-fluorescing vitrinite was present mostly in the upper Medicine River Seam, which was deposited in a regressive environment. The lower Medicine River Seam, which formed during a marine transgressive phase, contained greater amounts of fluorescing vitrinite. The Mannville coals in the Fenn area are moderately <b>under-pressured</b> in relation to those at Corbett Creek, which may have an impact on gas retention capacity. The difference in absolute coal permeability (1 - 3. 5 mD at Fenn versus 3 - 4 mD at Corbett Creek), which is likely the result of higher in-situ stresses in the deeper Mannville coals at Fenn, has had an effect on both gas and water production rates from these coals.

Using XMM-Newton and Chandra observations we probe the spatial distribution and the temperature of the cluster gas. We find that more than 60 per cent of powerful radio sources in the redshift range of our sample lie in a cluster of X-ray luminosity greater than 10 ^ 44 erg/s, and {{all but one of the}} narrow-line radio galaxies, for which the emission from the nucleus is obscured by a torus, lie in a cluster environment. Within the statistical uncertainties we find no significant difference in {{the properties of the}} environment as a function of the orientation to the line of sight of the radio jet. This is in agreement with unification schemes. Our results have important implications for cluster surveys, as clusters around powerful radio sources tend to be excluded from X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich surveys of galaxy clusters, and thus can introduce an important bias in the cluster luminosity function. Most of the radio sources are found close to pressure balance with the environment in which they lie, but the two low-excitation radio galaxies of the sample are observed to be <b>under-pressured.</b> This may be the first observational indication for the presence of non-radiative particles in the lobes of some powerful radio galaxies. We find that the clusters around radio sources in the redshift range of our sample have a steeper entropy-temperature relation than local clusters, and the slope is in agreement with the predictions of self-similar gravitational heating models for cluster gas infall. This suggests that selection by AGN finds systems less affected by AGN feedback than the local average.

40|$|Radio-loud AGN {{represent}} the most energetic and influential large-scale {{structures in the}} Universe. Through physical processes such as AGN feedback, they are suggested {{to play a major}} role in the evolution of galaxies. The key physical parameter in these studies is the jet power, which requires an accurately determined age for the source. In this thesis I present a detailed investigation of the dynamics and energetics of two powerful radio galaxies found in cluster environments, in order to probe the well known spectral age/dynamical age discrepancy. Through the use of the high-resolution and newly improved radio interferometer, the JVLA, I present the highest fidelity radio maps of 3 C 320 and 3 C 444 to date, which I then use to determine their spectral ages. I also present analysis of the deep and sensitive Chandra observation of the cluster shock surrounding 3 C 320, used to determine its dynamical age. Applying the most widely used models of spectral ageing I find that, although all models do not provide a reasonable fit to the data, the spectral and dynamical ages can be brought into agreement. I find that the low frequency spectral index (injection index) is relatively flat for these sources, agreeing with previously held assumptions although in contrast to recent work on spectral ageing. There is some suggestion to reject the Kardashev-Pacholczyk model as a valid ageing model for powerful radio galaxies, although this is not robust. I suggest that, since the Tribble model provides consistent fits compared to the other models while providing a more physically realistic description of spectral ageing in the lobes of radio galaxies, it may proceed to be the ageing model of choice for future studies. I argue that the combination of broad-bandwidth data at low and high frequencies with a lobe magnetic field that has a large departure from equipartition estimates can give an agreement between spectral and dynamical ages. I also argue that projection effects and a robust determination of the Mach number of the driven shock by the radio galaxy into its environment are also important factors which may cause a discrepancy in ages. I find no evidence for the conclusions drawn from previous work on powerful radio galaxies in richcluster environments, where it was suggested that their lobes are apparently <b>under-pressured</b> with respect to their environment and therefore require a significant contribution from non-radiating particles for pressure-balance. I therefore suggest that conclusions cannot be made regarding the effect of the environment on lobe particle content of powerful radio galaxies in these rich environments until further samples are studied...|$|R
40|$|A {{contracting}} consortium, {{comprising the}} Turkish contractor Asim-Alarko and the Dutch contractor Van Oord ACZ, has {{submitted to the}} Turkish Water Authority a new concept for an offshore fresh water pipeline between Turkey and Cyprus. Where conventional offshore pipelines are laid on the seabed and are made from steel, this new pipeline concept incorporates a submerged floating pipeline made from High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) which is anchored to the seabed by vertical anchor lines. This new concept could simplify the installation procedure of pipelines since the submerged floating pipeline will be anchored at a relatively limited depth below the sea level. This avoids the high forces resulting from installing a pipeline at great water depths and buckling due to external pressures. After previous feasibility studies the consortium requested Aker Kvaerner to perform detailed engineering for above-mentioned new pipeline concept. As {{a result of this}} the present study has been initiated to start with the global design of the concept, which has finally resulted in an extensive study of the following aspects: 9 ̆ 5 Study of the design parameters. 9 ̆ 5 Study of the hydraulics in the pipeline 9 ̆ 5 Study of the static behaviour of the proposed structure In the study of the design parameters it appears that especially some environmental data are difficult to quantify without doing an offshore survey; they are of great importance for the design. This concerns the marine growth at the relevant water depth, the magnitude and the direction of the deep-sea currents, the possible existence of internal waves and the soil properties. The properties of HDPE are also important for the design and therefore need accurate investigation, especially the stress-strain characteristics related to time and the creep behaviour of HDPE. Present material specifications appear to be not sufficient for final structural design. The pipeline must have the capacity to transport 75 million m 3 (2. 38 m 3 /s) of freshwater per year based on gravity flow. The hydraulic study showed that a pipeline with an internal diameter of 1. 48 [m] is needed. Wall-friction is the dominant cause of hydraulic losses in the pipeline. Friction losses owing to bends, valves, contractions and enlargements appear to be almost negligible. For further hydraulic design there are two aspects that need special attention. The first aspect is the possible occurrence of <b>under-pressures</b> near the coast of Cyprus during steady state flow in the pipeline. It is preferred to avoid these under-pressures; consequently, an adequate pressure control system will have to be designed. The second aspect, which needs extra attention, is surge. Closing operations of valves will initiate pressure waves. These pressure waves will have an important influence on the structural behaviour of the system. Investigation will be necessary to establish whether HDPE is able to withstand the related short-term loads or if a pressure release system is necessary. From the static analysis it appears that the configuration, as proposed by the contracting consortium, with a distance of 500 [m] between the vertical anchor lines should be technically feasible. However, local stress problems, which arise near the connection points of the vertical anchor lines, still have to be solved. It could even be necessary that in order to solve these problems small improvements in the original concept will have to be made. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
5000|$|Derby signed 16-year-old Scunthorpe United striker Charles Vernam for an {{undisclosed}} fee. Derby began league action in November against managerless Blackpool, after Ian Holloway left for Crystal Palace {{on the day of}} the match, Derby won the game 4-1 with first half goals from Theo Robinson and John Brayford with his first goal in over two years, Tom Ince scored early on in the second half for the visitors through a penalty, before Robinson get his second shortly after and Conor Sammon scored his first goal in two months to close the scoring. Three days later, Derby secured their first back-to-back victories in 24 league matches, after beating Barnsley 2-0 with second half goals from James O'Connor (his first for the club) and Nathan Tyson in the last minute of regulation time. Derby were unchanged for the second consecutive game at Millwall, however they trailed at half time after a 33rd-minute goal from Liam Feeney, before Will Hughes eqaulised 8 minutes into the second half, however Andrew Keogh got the winner for the hosts on 76 minutes. Hughes was called up for the England U21 squad and became the second youngest player in the side history. After his callup, Hughes was linked with moves to Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City, as Nigel Clough was reportedly <b>under-pressure</b> to raise £1.8 million in the January 2013 transfer window with Derby setting an asking price of £4 million for the 17-year-old. Right back John Brayford also was linked with a move to a Premier League outfit, in this case West Ham United. Nigel Clough denied this speculation and said there was no need to sell any players, however he wasn't surprised at the interest that was shown for both players. Out-of favour defender Tom Naylor joined Football League Two side Bradford City on loan from two months. Derby returned to league action on 17 November at table toppers Crystal Palace, Derby lost consecutive league games for the first time for the season with goals two goals from Glenn Murray and a single effort from André Moritz. Further speculation surrounded Hughes as Spanish giants FC Barcelona were also reported to have an interest in Hughes, after scouts from the Catalan club [...] "compiled a detailed dossier" [...] on Hughes when he appeared for England U17 in the Algarve Tournament in February 2012. Young Swiss defender Valentin Gjokaj joined League One outfit Carlisle United on loan for six weeks. Derby won their third consecutive match at home with a 3-2 win at Birmingham City, Derby dominated the first half however only scored once in the half through Conor Sammon, the second half was more equal with Marlon King scoring a penalty for the hosts with 17 minutes to then, Sammon netted again to regain the lead for Derby, before Peter Løvenkrands got a winner two minutes, Nathan Tyson score the winner a further two minutes later. Derby ended the month with a match at home to leaders Cardiff City, with the visitors taking the lead after 11 minutes through Heidar Helguson, a lead which Cardiff held until half-time, however Craig Noone was sent off for the hosts after 63 minutes for a second bookable offence, Theo Robinson equalised with his 8th goal of the season with 21 minutes to go, Derby pushed for a winner but the scores stayed 1-1, with Derby 12th in the table, 5 points behind the play-off places and 12 above the relegation zone.|$|E
50|$|On {{the first}} weekend of February Sheffield Wednesday played Yeovil Town at Hillsborough Stadium. The game ended up {{being one of the}} toughest wins of the season, with Wednesday winning 2-1 after a first-half goal from almost nothing by Jonathan Obika gave Yeovil Town the lead, but Jermaine Johnson's shot from 25-yards {{equalised}} and then the other Johnson, Reda Johnson added another goal to the season with ten-minutes to go to win the game. In such {{an important part of the}} season, where points are so vital, there was a mid-week distraction for The Owls in the FA Cup replay against Blackpool, many changes were made and proved costly as The Owls went down 0-3, all goals coming in the first-half. Although Gary Megson did not see this as an unfortunate happening when Sheffield Wednesday were knocked out at the fourth round replay stage. Back to their only competition left, the League One they were away to relegation-threatened Exeter City, and although Wednesday were second in the league they had played two extra games than some of the teams around them, the most threatening of which was Sheffield United. Therefore, it was more important to get maximum points in the games in hope they can get far enough ahead that the games in hand Sheffield United and other teams have would not be enough to catch them. Having struggled the previous game but still came out with a win, Jermaine Johnson scored is fourth goal in as many matches when he struck in the second-half, however two minutes later on the sixty-eighth minute, Billy Jones equalised for Exeter City, before David Noble scored with six minutes to go and ending the game in a 2-1 loss for Wednesday. This gave teams around them a chance to catch up and Sheffield United were now one point behind them and their city rivals had two games in hand, meaning if they won those they would be five points clear in second, and probably ending any hopes Sheffield Wednesday had of automatic promotion. However, their next game was at home in Sheffield Wednesday's first mid-week home fixture of the season, and having only being beaten once at home against top of the table The Owls were hoping to bounce back. With city rivals Sheffield United breathing closely down Wednesday's backs, Sheffield Wednesday were hoping they would slip up on the same night as they played tough opposition against fourth place Huddersfield Town. However, it was a night to forget for Sheffield Wednesday as a goal from Scott Laird on the stroke of half-time saw The Owls lose for the second time at home this season against Stevenage and meanwhile Sheffield United won Huddersfield Town away 0-1. This meant Wednesday's city rivals went two points ahead with two games in hand. After three losses on the bounce in all competitions Sheffield Wednesday came across North Derbyshire rivals Chesterfield away. Chesterfield were second-to-bottom of the league, but in a derby game form usually 'goes out of the window'. Sheffield Wednesday conceded a penalty on the seventy-eighth minute that Dean Morgan finished and ended the game 1-0 to Chesterfield. Sheffield United won again and with it being the later stages of the season Sheffield Wednesday felt their automatic promotion chances were gone and rivals Sheffield United would beat them to it. Sheffield Wednesday in such a poor run of form, their poorest of the season, it could not have come at a worse time for the club as they face Sheffield United in the Steel City derby at the last weekend of February. Meanwhile, Gary Megson had signed Michail Antonio from Reading on loan until the end of the season after other winger Jermaine Johnson had been put aside injured. Rumours in the media had been suggesting that Gary Megson was not going to last much longer as manager of the club, although Wednesday fans dismissed this as the club still had the chance of getting promoted as they were third in the league even though the club had lost their last four matches in all competitions. Sheffield United were clear favourites having won their last three games, but saw themselves all level at 0-0 at half-time. A surprisingly even contest saw Sheffield Wednesday just having the better of the play in the second half in front of the largest crowd of the season of over 36,000. Then quite amazingly a ball down the right-hand side by debutant Michail Antonio saw Lewis Buxton cross the ball into the box first time and Chris O'Grady headed into the back of the net. The Sheffield Wednesday supporters went crazy and all the players went to celebrate with supposedly <b>under-pressure</b> manager Gary Megson. Although having conceded late goals in the past Wednesday went on to win 1-0. However, after that win Sheffield United were two points ahead of Sheffield Wednesday and if they won their games in hand it could potentially be eight points, leaving Sheffield Wednesday still with hardly any hope of reaching the automatic promotion spot. Mid-week saw Sheffield United win one of their games in hand to put them five points clear and that same night probably the most surprising and shocking news of the season was confirmed, Sheffield Wednesday manager Gary Megson had been sacked.|$|E

40|$|A wake {{model for}} the free-streamline theory is {{proposed}} to treat the two-dimensional flow past an obstacle with a wake or cavity formation. In this model the wake flow is approximately described in the large by an equivalent potential flow such that along the wake boundary the pressure first assumes a prescribed constant <b>under-pressure</b> in a region downstream of the separation points (called the near-wake) and then increases continuously from this <b>under-pressure</b> to the given free stream value in an infinite wake strip of finite width (the far-wake). The boundary of the wake trailing a lifting body is allowed to change its slope and curvature at finite distances from the body and is required to be parallel to the main stream only asymptotically at downstream infinity. The pressure variation along the far-wake takes place {{in such a way}} that the upper and lower boundaries of the far-wake form a branch slit of undetermined shape in the hodograph plane. One advantage of this wake model is that it provides a rather smooth continuous transition of the hydrodynamic forces from the fully developed wake flow to the fully wetted flow as the wake disappears. When applied to the wake flow past an inclined flat plate, this model yields the exact solution in a closed form for the whole range of the wake <b>under-pressure</b> coefficient. The separated flow over a slightly cambered plate can be calculated by a perturbation theory based on this exact solution...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{explain a}} {{clinical}} observation: a notch in the stimulus spectrum during transient evoked otoacoustic emission measurement in ears with secretory otitis media. Methods: The effects of tympanic <b>under-pressure</b> were investigated using a pressure chamber. A {{model of the}} ear canal was also studied. Results: Tympanic membrane reflectance increased {{as a consequence of}} increased stiffness, causing a notch in the stimulus spectrum. In an adult, the notch could be clearly distinguished at an <b>under-pressure</b> of approximately - 185 daPa. The sound frequency of the notch corresponded to a wavelength four times the ear canal length. The ear canal of infants was too short to cause a notch within the displayed frequency range. The notch was demonstrated using both Otodynamics and Madsen equipment. Conclusion: A notch in the otoacoustic emission stimulus spectrum can be caused by increased stiffness of the tympanic membrane, raising suspicion of low middle-ear pressure or secretory otitis media. This finding is not applicable to infants...|$|E
