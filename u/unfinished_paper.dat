It was a little old Georgian house with worn and graceful rooms, a dignified front door and a fine gateway of Sussex ironwork much painted and eaten away. She arranged it with great care; she had kept most of her furniture, and his study had his father's bureau, and the selfsame agate paper-weight that had pressed the <b>unfinished</b> <b>paper</b> he left when he died. She was a woman of persistent friendships, and there came to her, old connections of those early times trailing fresher and younger people in their wake, sons, daughters, nephews, disciples; her son brought home all sorts of interesting men, and it was remarkable to her that amidst the talk and discussion at her table, she discovered aspects of her son and often quite intimate aspects she would never have seen with him alone.|$|E

Ego defenses are often employed by the ego when id behaviour conflicts with reality and either society's morals, norms, and taboos, or an individual's internalization of these morals, norms, and taboos. Freud noted however that {{in the face of}} conflicts with superego or id, it was always 'possible for the ego to avoid a rupture by submitting to encroachments on its own unity and even perhaps by effecting a cleavage or division of itself'. In a late, <b>unfinished</b> <b>paper</b> he examined how sometimes 'the instinct is allowed to retain its satisfaction and proper respect is shown to reality...at the price of a rift in the ego which never heals but increases as time goes on...a splitting of the ego'.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is concerned with}} the detection and removal of hazardous biocide residues from historic applications to herbarium collections. There are two main aims: • To develop a rapid, cost-effective and non-destructive screening method for identifying toxic residues on herbarium sheets; and • To establish the most suitable decontamination method for the removal of naphthalene from herbarium collections, maintaining the integrity of the specimen. The research outlines how the presence of fluorescent marks on specimen sheets throughout the herbarium, at Amgueddfa Cymru- National Museum Wales (AC-NMW), is indicative of mercury(II) chloride contamination. Compelling evidence is given to support the hypothesis that the observed fluorescence is due to the reduction of Hg(II) to Hg(I) during the oxidative degradation of cellulose, occurring as part of the natural ageing process. The rate of fluorescence development is shown to be increased by the presence of naphthalene, and is estimated to take at least 30 years to develop. From the results obtained, it is evident that a hand-held UV-A lamp can provide a rapid and effective method of identifying samples within a collection that are contaminated with mercury, thus providing a rapid and economical means to prioritise which collections require immediate re-mounting. Furthermore, this method will enforce the implementation of safe, standard procedures to protect personnel and visitors when handling the collections, plus enable the removal of a large amount of hazardous chemical from the herbarium environment. It is also demonstrated, through decontamination tests, that the air-drying of contaminated specimen sheets is a more efficient method of removing naphthalene, than either freeze-drying or oven-drying. It is also the most cost-effective, and the least damaging to the specimen. It is shown that the efficacy of the decontamination is dependent upon the <b>paper</b> type. Thin, <b>unfinished,</b> <b>papers</b> are more efficient at losing naphthalene than the heavier, finished and coated papers, as their porous structure allows the naphthalene to remain more mobile. These results provide important information about which specimen sheets {{are more likely to be}} successfully decontaminated by the air-drying procedure and can inform the selection and prioritisation process...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores three ongoing {{areas of}} rule-making {{activity}} under the General Agreement on Trade in Services – emergency safeguards (ESM), subsidies and govern-ment procurement. It suggests that as policy makers {{turn their attention}} to a range of new issues {{in the context of a}} second set of GATS negotiations, it is essential that new impetus be given to completing what the Uruguay Round left <b>unfinished.</b> The <b>paper</b> first examines the desirability, feasibility and prospects for developing multi-lateral rules on an emergency safeguard mechanism and trade distorting subsidies, in the context of the ongoing GATS negotiations. Using the existing framework of trade in goods as a model, the paper examines whether and how relevant GATT principles might be applicable in these two areas in the context of services trade. The paper sug-gests that the very feasibility of an ESM remains an open question, given the state of our knowledge of services trade. The paper cautions, however, that the clear political expec-tation on the part of many developing countries that concrete disciplines must arise from the current discussions suggests that it is likely that the GATS will feature some form of ESM in the future, much as its ultimate substantive provisions and operationa...|$|R

At the graduate level, he taught seminars on cognition, the history of psychology, and the work of Michel Foucault. Starting about 1997, his undergraduate teaching narrowed to only statistics. In 1995, he published a review of psychological research on the aesthetics of the Golden Section, which soon became his most-cited article.

40|$|We analyze a discrete-time {{queueing}} model {{where two}} types of customers, each having their own dedicated server, are accommodated in one single FCFS queue. Service times are deterministically equal to s≥ 1 time slots each.

As a result, arriving customers may (or may not) have the tendency to cluster according to their types, which may lead to more (or less) blocking of one type by the opposite type. The paper reveals {{the impact of this}} blocking phenomenon on the achievable throughput, the (average) system content, the (average) customer delay and the (average) <b>unfinished</b> work.

40|$|After a {{half century}} of overtly inward-oriented policies, Brazil finally moved to open its trade regime in the early 1990 s. Being one the last {{countries}} to make this move {{in a region that}} notoriously lagged behind East Asia, Brazil was quick to implement a comprehensive trade liberalization program, which had strong unilateral and regional components. In roughly five years, tariffs were slashed, nontariff barriers were removed, and Mercosur became a reality. Later on, even the possibility of a free trade zone for the hemisphere was entertained. Yet this initial momentum lost steam in the mid- 1990 s, undermined by inhospitable macroeconomic and international environments. When, {{at the turn of the}} century, the right macroeconomic policies were finally put in place and Brazil began to enjoy the benefits of a commodity boom, a new government took over that clearly had a skeptical view of trade. Despite initial concern, however, the political transition did not bring a significant policy reversal. But trade policy reform never regained its momentum, despite its <b>unfinished</b> agenda. This <b>paper</b> examines this agenda and argues that if Brazil really wants to fully enjoy the growth and welfare benefits of trade, it needs to further lower and rationalize its structure of protection; adopt a more aggressive, World Trade Organization-plus, policy to open markets abroad; design a regional integration strategy that makes sense to its smaller partners; and bring trade facilitation, particularly transport costs, to the core of its trade agenda...|$|R
40|$|Several {{progresses}} {{have been}} made in evaluating the development policies for rural areas in the last years; many indicators 1 have been set for assessing the effectiveness of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and Rural Development Policies (RDPs) and their role on the convergence process of the EU members, but a shared definition of rurality is still missing. The results obtained at the level of growth and development by the most lagging behind areas, are far from being satisfactory (Brasili, 2005). The evaluation of the policies and programmes introduced evidenced lack of institutional planning and implementing abilities, and an insufficient targeting of policies and payments (Mantino, 2010). The experience of the 10 New Member States (NMSs) 2 showed how the current CAP and Cohesion policy, designed for the EU- 15 (Csaki et al. 2010), aren’t enough for addressing the regional specificities, hindering a process of development which is already weakened by the effects of the <b>unfinished</b> transition. This <b>paper</b> aims at offering a methodological contribution for evaluating the EU membership, with particular attention to the CAP, in Hungary. We chose this Country among the 10 NMSs because of the relevance (96 %) of the rural areas on the total land 3, and given the historical socio-economic role played by agriculture. The authors believe that more targeted – and therefore efficient – policies for agricultural and rural areas require a deeper knowledge of their structural and dynamic characteristics. Therefore, in order to identify the changes occurred before (2003) and after (2007) the EU membership on agricultural and rural areas, we use the following multivariate statistics methodologies: Principal Components Analysis, applied to the set of 42 variables, and Cluster Analysis on the results obtained by the Principal Components Analysis. Then, we offer a preliminary evaluation of the distribution of Single Area Payment Scheme (SAPS) 4, using the information on the applications provided at the County level by the Hungarian Paying Agency to show correlations with the leading factors.
