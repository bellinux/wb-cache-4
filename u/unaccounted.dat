5|$|Bishop of Mannar (a north western town), Rayappu Joseph, says 146,679 {{people seem}} to be <b>unaccounted</b> between 2008 October {{and at the end of}} the civil war.|$|E
5|$|Historically, one of {{the largest}} {{releases}} was from the Colex plant, a lithium-isotope separation plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The plant operated in the 1950s and 1960s. Records are incomplete and unclear, but government commissions have estimated that some two million pounds of mercury are <b>unaccounted</b> for.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Joan {{killed at}} least 216 people, with 118 <b>unaccounted</b> for. The total cost of damage was around $2billion (1988USD). All of the deaths {{and most of the}} damage were due to the Joan portion of Hurricane Joan–Miriam.|$|E
5|$|By 17 November the Mafeking and Pretoria districts {{had been}} fully explored, {{with more than}} 200 bodies raised to the surface in the {{preceding}} two days. On 20 November an official announcement reported that 439 miners had died, of whom 33 were still <b>unaccounted</b> for. Toward {{the end of the}} month, the men voted to return to work, even though the western workings were still out of action and 11 bodies were still missing.|$|E
5|$|By 22:15 {{the brigade}} had secured {{all of its}} day one {{objectives}} {{and some of the}} missing men had arrived in the brigade area. However, there were many still <b>unaccounted</b> for. The 4th Parachute Battalion numbered around 200 men with almost no heavy weapons. The 6th (Royal Welch) Parachute Battalion had 317 men. There were only enough men of the 5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion to guard the approach roads leading to the drop zone from the north.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{majority}} of known extrasolar planets, 55 Cancri c was detected by observing changes in its star's radial velocity. This was achieved by making sensitive measurements of the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum. At the time of discovery, 55 Cancri A was already known to possess one planet (55 Cancri b); however, {{there was still a}} drift in the radial velocity measurements which was <b>unaccounted</b> for.|$|E
5|$|After {{the liberation}} of the Netherlands, the Grave Registration units of 2nd Army began the task of {{identifying}} the British dead. They were buried together in a field that is on permanent loan to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission just north of Oosterbeek. There are nearly 1,800 graves {{in what is now}} known as the Airborne Cemetery, ¾ of which are for those killed during the 1944 battle. By 2003, there were still 138 men <b>unaccounted</b> for and human remains, equipment and weaponry continue to be dug up in the farmland around the city.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of {{discovery}} in 2001, 47 Ursae Majoris was already known to host one extrasolar planet, designated 47 Ursae Majoris b. Further measurements of the radial velocity revealed another periodicity in the data <b>unaccounted</b> for by the first planet. This periodicity {{could be explained by}} assuming that a second planet, designated 47 Ursae Majoris c, existed in the system with an orbital period close to 7 years. Observations of the photosphere of 47 Ursae Majoris suggested that the periodicity could not be explained by stellar activity, making the planet interpretation more likely. The planet was announced in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Trepkos {{arrive on}} the scene. Mulder radios the {{evacuation}} team but—knowing that Trepkos will refuse to go—reports that only he and Scully have survived the ordeal. The agents enter a month-long quarantine while the Chemical Corps confiscates the lab and cordons off Mount Avalon. Firewalker is salvaged, but is too damaged to yield sufficient data. Trepkos and O'Neil are officially <b>unaccounted</b> for and presumed dead; Trepkos is last seen carrying O'Neil's body as he disappears into the volcano.|$|E
5|$|The Bundeswehr {{gave the}} {{remaining}} border guards and other ex-NVA soldiers {{the task of}} clearing the fortifications, which was completed only in 1994. The scale of the task was immense, involving both the clearing of the fortifications and the rebuilding of hundreds of roads and railway lines. A serious complication was the presence of mines along the border. Although the 1.4million mines laid by the GDR {{were supposed to have}} been removed during the 1980s, it turned out that 34,000 were <b>unaccounted</b> for. A further 1,100mines were found and removed following reunification at a cost of more than DM250million, in a programme that was not concluded until the end of 1995.|$|E
5|$|Total {{damage from}} Cyclone Althea {{amounted}} to just under A$120 million (1971), and the normalised damage total for 2012, {{which accounts for}} growth and inflation, was estimated at $648 million. Throughout the affected region, 257 people were treated for storm-related injuries, mostly inflicted by airborne debris; three people were killed. In Townsville, ten people were reported missing during the cyclone: nine on three boats that were <b>unaccounted</b> for, and one whose car {{was found in a}} swollen creek. They were all found safe.|$|E
5|$|Upon forming {{and moving}} {{parallel}} to India's west coastline, the storm dropped rainfall in the Konkan region of Maharashtra and neighboring Goa. The {{threat of the}} storm prompted schools to be closed around Mumbai. Later, it brushed Gujarat with heavy rainfall and gusty winds. About 50boats were stranded amid high seas, and 11 other boats were left missing from the Veraval port. During {{the height of the}} storm, 320fishermen were <b>unaccounted</b> for, spurring the Indian navy to launch search and rescue missions.|$|E
5|$|When the Indiana Territory {{chartered}} the Indiana Canal Company in 1805 {{to build}} a canal around the Falls of the Ohio, near Clarksville, Clark {{was named to the}} board of directors. He became part of the surveying team that assisted in laying out the route of the canal. The company collapsed the next year before construction could begin, when two of the fellow board members, including Vice President Aaron Burr, were arrested for treason. A large part of the company's $1.2million ($60.5 million in 2009 chained dollars) in investments was <b>unaccounted</b> for; its location was never determined.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{contingent}} did {{not reach}} {{in time for the}} fighting, the city's capital was taken. Aside from some farm life, the town had been largely abandoned. The taking of the region marked a continuous swath of territory held by Armenians stretching from Karabakh to Armenia proper, a total of 3,000 square kilometers. In the retreat through the Omar Pass of the Murov mountain range, many Azeri refugees froze to death. With the last helicopters leaving on April 1, they were forced to walk through the heavy snow at freezing temperatures. Nearly 39,000 civilians were processed into the camps at Yevlakh and Dashkesen with as many as 15,000 <b>unaccounted</b> for. Four Azerbaijani MI-8 helicopters ferrying refugees and wounded out of the conflict zone crashed, the last of which was hit by Armenian forces. Human Rights Watch findings concluded that during the Kalbajar offensive Armenian forces committed numerous violations of the rules of war, including forcible exodus of civilian population, indiscriminate fire and hostage-taking.|$|E
5|$|In early 1949, {{physicist}} Robert Bacher {{stepped down}} from the Atomic Energy Commission. He and AEC Chairman David Lilienthal wanted a physicist to replace Bacher, and they ultimately recommended Smyth for the position. President Harry Truman nominated Smyth to the AEC later that year, prompting Smyth resign as Physics Department chairman. (His old colleague Allen Shenstone took up the post.) Smyth was the commission's only scientist. He spent his first weeks in the position attending hearings of the U.S. Congress's Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. Led by Senator Bourke Hickenlooper, the hearings inquired into a small amount of uranium that was alleged to be <b>unaccounted</b> for in AEC labs. Smyth later condemned the hearings as grounded in misconceptions about the work of nuclear scientists.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{complaints}} {{regarding the}} high retail {{price for the}} three-record set, particularly in Britain – {{a result of the}} government's refusal to waive its tax surcharge – controversy soon surrounded the project's fundraising. Because the event had not been registered as a UNICEF benefit beforehand, and was therefore not granted tax-exempt status – the blame for which Harrison lay squarely at Klein's feet – most of the money generated was held in an Internal Revenue Service escrow account for ten years. In interview with Derek Taylor for his autobiography in the late 1970s, Harrison put this figure at somewhere between $8 million and $10 million. Before then, in early 1972, New York magazine reported that some of the proceeds remained <b>unaccounted</b> for and had found their way into Klein's accounts. Klein responded by suing the magazine for $150 million in damages, and although the suit was later withdrawn, the accusations attracted unwelcome scrutiny at a time when questions were also being asked about Klein's mismanagement of the Beatles' finances. That year, an estimated $2 million had gone to the refugees via UNICEF before the IRS audit of Apple got under way; finally, in 1981, $8.8 million was added to that total following the audit.|$|E
5|$|During recurvature, Typhoon Tip passed about 65km (40mi) east of Okinawa. Sustained winds reached 72km/h (44mph), with gusts to 112km/h (69mph). Sustained wind {{velocities}} in Japan are not known, {{though they}} were estimated at minimal typhoon strength. The passage of the typhoon through the region resulted in {{millions of dollars in}} damage to the agricultural and fishing industries of the country. Eight ships were grounded or sunk by Tip, leaving 44fishermen dead or <b>unaccounted</b> for. A Chinese freighter broke in half {{as a result of the}} typhoon, though its crew of 46 were rescued. The rainfall led to over 600mudslides throughout the mountainous regions of Japan and flooded more than 22,000homes; 42people died throughout the country, with another 71missing and 283injured. River embankments broke in 70 places, destroying 27 bridges, while about 105 dikes were destroyed. Following the storm, at least 11,000 people were left homeless. Tip destroyed apple, rice, peach and other crops. Five ships sank in heavy seas off the coast and 50-story buildings swayed in the capital, Tokyo. Transportation in the country was disrupted; 200 trains and 160 domestic flights were canceled. Tip was described as the most severe storm to strike Japan in 13 years.|$|E
5|$|In Chittagong, about 115km (70mi) {{north of}} where Akash moved ashore, surface {{stations}} reported peak winds of 37km/h (23mph) and a pressure of 996.8vhPa. Near its landfall location, Akash produced high tides that flooded coastal areas {{with up to}} 1.5m (5ft) of water, destroying at least 30businesses. The cyclone destroyed 205houses and left an additional 845 damaged. Akash caused moderate crop damage near the coast, including 2ha (4.9acres) of destroyed lands of shrimp farms. Heavy precipitation was reported, with one station reporting a total of 53mm (2.12in); the rainfall caused flooding in inland areas. The heavy rains, caused by outer bands of the cyclone before it made landfall, limited play in Chittagong in the third One Day International cricket match between India and Bangladesh, before the match was abandoned. Strong winds caused power outages throughout Cox's Bazar District, and downed about 200 trees on St. Martin's Island. The cyclone left a total of 10boats <b>unaccounted</b> for, with about 50fishermen missing. In total, three fisherman were confirmed killed, all on St. Martin's Island, with two people left hospitalized. The passage of Cyclone Akash left many people homeless. Initially {{there was no response}} from the government. In all, 14 people were killed by Akash and damages amounted to US$982million.|$|E
5|$|One {{shrimp boat}} was {{initially}} reported missing and the tug Myra White transmitted a distress signal as its engines failed near an oil rig off of Galveston. High winds shattered glass windows at Port Arthur, Texas City, and Galveston, while schools {{were shut down}} in Galveston, Lamarque, Texas City, Alvin, and most of Galveston and Jefferson counties. Despite a brief power outage at Lamarque, electricity was quickly restored after the storm. Powerful gusts downed branches, electrical poles, and tore off shingles in Port Arthur and Galveston, but damage was minimal at High Island, where Cindy made landfall. The U.S. Coast Guard responded to four requests for assistance at Galveston, and nine vessels attempted to seek refuge at Port Arthur; the Coast Guard eventually permitted six to enter, {{and the other three}} apparently traveled to Galveston. Meanwhile, to the northwest, the port of Houston was closed {{for the duration of the}} storm. Trucks and boats were dispatched by civil defense officials in Jefferson County after declaring a state of emergency following numerous requests for assistance by residents of flooded homes. Two children, initially <b>unaccounted</b> for, were later found safe under a bridge abutment.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister of Bangladesh Khaleda Zia urged senior {{officials}} in Dhaka and coastal districts {{to prepare for}} the storm. Officials in Chittagong asked that all 24ships be moved out of the harbor and river channel. In coastal areas, thousands of Red Crescent volunteers reported for duty in order to assist vulnerable villages in preparation of the storm. Winds destroyed bamboo huts, uprooted trees, and disrupted road transport between towns and villages on the shore of the Bay of Bengal. Torrential rainfall in the area flooded dozens of villages, forcing thousands to evacuate. Heavy precipitation also lashed the capital city of Dhaka, inundating streets, which caused a shutdown of electricity and interrupting public transportation. One death was reported after a man drowned while attempting to cross a river in southern Bhola Island. Ten wooden trawlers carrying 150men sank near Cox's Bazar; only 11 of them were known to have survived. An additional eight fishing boats transporting 60people was reported missing off of Barisal Division. By November15, 47fishing vessels were still <b>unaccounted</b> for. A navy motor boat also sunk near Kutubdia, though its six crew members swam ashore. In the aftermath of the storm, the number of deaths in Bangladesh rose to 49.|$|E
5|$|Rukia meets Ichigo in {{the midst}} of a hollow attack. After {{suffering}} her injuries, Rukia transfers her powers to Ichigo in order to save themselves. While he succeeds, Kuchiki is left too weak to return to Soul Society, and lives with Ichigo in the human world, intending to stay until her powers are restored. Therefore, her only ability then is her kidō spells, which are severely limited in strength and variety. She uses her kidō for such purposes as restraining, healing and attacking others. Because of the amount of time she spends with Ichigo, Rukia has been able to gain a keen understanding of his inner workings. Rukia's relationship with Ichigo is unique, for despite the relatively short amount of time they have known each other, Ichigo can easily confide in her and considers her a true friend because she is encouraging and understands what he is feeling. During her time in the human world, Rukia remains <b>unaccounted</b> for in Soul Society, so Byakuya Kuchiki and Renji Abarai are sent to find her and return her to the Soul Society. They succeed, and upon their return Rukia is sentenced to death for giving her Soul Reaper powers to a human. Kurosaki ultimately arrives in Soul Society in time to stop her execution, and tries to get her to safety.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} {{incursion}} was countered by the RAR, {{but after a}} tactical error in its third engagement with the guerrillas led to casualties, the African Rifles were joined by 2 Commando, RLI on 25 August 1967. The insurgents were consistently undone in their incursions by the suspicion of Rhodesia's rural blacks, whose tribal chiefs and headmen would often work together to inform the police and security forces of the infiltrators' presence. This proved to be no exception: when a cadre visited a local kraal early on 31 August to obtain food, an old woman invited him to stay and kept him there while she sent a young girl to alert the security forces. 7 Troop, 2 Commando arrived at 07:20 and captured the insurgent, who then guided 7 Troop, led by Lieutenant Charl Viljoen, and a platoon of RAR men to where his five comrades were encamped. The combined force surrounded the guerrillas and opened fire, killing four; the fifth escaped and returned to Zambia. The next day, on 1 September, some 2 Commando troops in ambush were informed by a tractor driver {{that he had been}} given money by 14 guerrillas the previous night to buy mielie-meal for them, and that they would be collecting it from him at his kraal that evening. A sweep was planned; the tractor driver was briefed and returned to the kraal with the mielie-meal while 2 Commando and the RAR formed a cordon around it. The following morning the soldiers performed their sweep but failed to find the enemy, who were already gone. The insurgents, who were actually 17 in number and all South African Umkhonto fighters, crossed the border into Botswana and were arrested there on 3 September. Of the 79 cadres who had crossed the border on 1 August, 29 were killed and 17 captured within Rhodesia, 29 were arrested in Botswana, where one also died, one was arrested in Durban and one escaped back to Zambia. One remained <b>unaccounted</b> for. Nickel was officially closed at 06:00 on 8 September 1967.|$|E
5|$|On {{its first}} landfall, the {{tropical}} storm buffeted the eastern-central Philippines with damaging winds gusting up to 160km/h (100mph), heavy rainfall, and rough seas. At least 20 provinces experienced adverse or dangerous weather, {{with the worst}} conditions concentrated over the islands of Samar and Masbate. While structural and crop damages were limited, local infrastructure and transportation suffered the greatest. Nepartak's winds caused complete power outages on Samar, Masbate, and nearby Marinduque, affecting their entire collective population of nearly four million individuals. Many schools were closed. The storm forced the cancellation of nearly two dozen domestic flights {{to and from the}} region, and at least 120 ferries and other vessels sought shelter in ports around the Manila, Bicol, and Visayas regions. On those ships were more than 5,000 people who became stranded until safe passage could be made. By November 15, five deaths had been confirmed in the Philippines, four the result of electrocutions from downed powerlines. Immediately following the disaster, then-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo made assisting the stranded passengers in coastal ports a priority. According to the PAGASA in its post-storm report, a total of 13 people lost their lives, 5 others remained <b>unaccounted</b> for, and 11 sustained injuries. One newspaper reported that a motorized craft in the Tañon Strait capsized {{at the height of the}} storm, forcing the rescue of 11 people. Another source also describes the sinking of a boat with at least 13 survivors and one fatality. It is not clear whether these accounts cover the same incident.|$|E
25|$|Eisenstadt {{reported}} 'about eight infantry divisions remain <b>unaccounted</b> for' as of March 1993.|$|E
25|$|In all, 99 men and {{two women}} from Umona died, Edwin Clarke was <b>unaccounted</b> for after being {{captured}} and was presumed dead, and only five survivors were rescued.|$|E
25|$|The U.K. War Office {{figures for}} Ottoman {{casualties}} were: total accounted for 725,000 (killed 50,000, died of wounds 35,000, died of disease 400,000, wounded 400,000). Total <b>unaccounted</b> for: 1,565,000 (prisoners, deserters, invalids and missing).|$|E
25|$|By {{the second}} IRA ceasefire, another team was still operational, and two Barrett rifles {{remained}} <b>unaccounted</b> for. The campaign {{is viewed as}} the most efficient overall IRA operation in Northern Ireland for this period.|$|E
25|$|The major <b>unaccounted</b> pool is belowground productivity, {{especially}} {{production and}} turnover of roots. Belowground components of NPP {{are difficult to}} measure. BNPP (below-ground NPP) is often estimated based on a ratio of ANPP:BNPP (above-ground NPP:below-ground NPP) rather than direct measurements.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to stack emissions, another source <b>unaccounted</b> {{for in the}} emission inventory is fly ash from ash ponds, the final disposal place for fly ash that has been collected in settling tanks. Ash ponds are continually eroded by wind during the dry season.|$|E
25|$|At about 1130 hrs vessels {{started to}} bring bodies ashore. The chief constable of Kent {{took charge of}} the dead and {{designated}} the Market Hall below Dover Museum as a temporary mortuary. 45 bodies were recovered but about another 100 people were <b>unaccounted</b> for.|$|E
25|$|Average {{non-revenue water}} was 7.3% in 2007, varying {{from less than}} 5% up to 15%. The low level of water leakage, down from 18% in 1978, has been {{achieved}} through speedy repairs that are typically undertaken {{the same day that}} a connection is reported, and through the use of high-quality pipe materials. The government's target is to reduce losses to 2% for large utilities and 5% for small utilities. Japan is perhaps the only country in the world that also collects nationwide data on <b>unaccounted</b> for sewage, i.e. the amount of water that erroneously enters the sanitary sewer system e.g. through connections from stormwater sewers or groundwater leakage. The average <b>unaccounted</b> for sewerage is 12%, varying from 6% in Shiga to 30% in Sapporo.|$|E
25|$|There is {{much debate}} {{as to whether}} the {{mechanism}} had indicators for all five of the planets known to the ancient Greeks. No gearing for such a planetary display survives and all gears are accounted for—with the exception of one 63-toothed gear (r1) otherwise <b>unaccounted</b> for in fragment D.|$|E
25|$|On 24 February 2016, a Tara Air Viking Air DHC-6 Series 400 Twin Otter {{carrying}} 18 {{passengers and}} 3 crew crashed after takeoff from Pokhara, Nepal, with none surviving. Search crews have found 19 bodies thus far and later updated total to 23 passengers as two babies were <b>unaccounted</b> for.|$|E
25|$|Over {{subsequent}} days, prisoners collated {{the names}} of 47 prisoners they considered to be <b>unaccounted</b> for. On 15 April (17 April in some sources) the new senior British officer, Group Captain Douglas Wilson RAAF, surreptitiously passed a list of these names to an official visitor from the Swiss Red Cross.|$|E
