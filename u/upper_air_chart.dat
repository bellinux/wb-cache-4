40|$|On 29 July 1993 severe {{thunderstorms}} tracked northeastwards across central Alberta {{resulting in}} numerous severe weather events including 3 reported tornadoes. Radar imagery {{was used to}} associate observed storm structure and evolution with the analyzed synoptic and mesoscale environmental conditions. Available data consisted of <b>upper</b> <b>air</b> <b>charts,</b> sounding data, radar data, and surface observations. Surface observations indicate that a dryline formed over {{the southwest corner of}} the province. It is suspected that enhanced convergence {{in the vicinity of the}} dryline played a role in the initiation of convection. Propagation of the dryline was associated with significant decreases in dewpoint (~ 10 °C in 2 hours) and veering of the surface winds. Two severe storms formed within 30 km of the dryline and in the region where the dryline was oriented in such a way as to enhance low-level convergence. The 1200 UTC sounding and <b>upper</b> <b>air</b> <b>charts</b> showed a conditionally unstable environment and veering of the low-level winds with relatively unidirectional wind shear aloft. These conditions have been shown to be indicative of potential storm splitting favoring the right-moving storm (Weisman and Klemp 1982, 1986). Two of the four severe storms that developed exhibited classic radar signatures characteristic of splitting storms prior to splitting. The right-moving member of one of these storms later spawned an F 3 tornado. By highlighting the synoptic and mesoscale features indicative of dryline formation and storm splitting, we hope to help the severe weather meteorologist anticipate storm genesis and behavior and quickly adapt severe thunderstorm and tornado warning areas accordingly...|$|R
40|$|Ocean bottom basic {{surveys have}} been {{conducted}} 12 times in the Antarctic Ocean by HAKUREI-MARU since 1980 - 81. There have been considerable weather condition differences between good weather years and bad years as follows. In the best year, the survey team had 80. 3 % good condition time (wind force 4 or less) during the survey, but only 37. 6 % in the worst year. These weather condition differences are mostly due to the frequent appearance of developed cyclones {{is caused by the}} location of the westerly long wave trough in the <b>upper</b> <b>air</b> general circulation. When the westerly long wave trough was located just west of the survey area, cyclones from middle latitude developed as they moved southward along {{the east side of the}} long wave trough to the survey area. Recently we can obtain good analyzed <b>upper</b> <b>air</b> <b>charts</b> for the whole southern hemisphere, and it has become possible to predict the positions of the <b>upper</b> <b>air</b> long wave trough and ridge several weeks ahead. This leads to the possibility of predicting the long range trend of weather conditions in the Antarctic survey area...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} which real-time Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) data was compared with Northwest Airlines <b>upper</b> <b>air</b> <b>charts.</b> It was demonstrated that the regions of steep gradient in total ozone corresponded with fronts in the upper troposphere, specifically breaks in the tropopause associated with jet streams. Other small scale structures in the ozone {{could be related to}} minor trough and ridge lines. This suggests that the relation between total ozone and tropopause height might apply even on relatively small scales, and an analysis produced high correlation coefficients provided that the air mass origin was considered. In a second test, cabin ozone mixing at 37, 000 ft. varied from less than 100 ppb (300 DU total ozone) to greater than 300 ppb in a trough (400 DU total ozone).

40|$|The monthly {{evaporation}} during 1957 from {{a region}} in Southern Sweden has been computed {{by means of}} studies of the precipitation and the net influx of water vapour into the area. <b>Upper</b> <b>air</b> <b>charts</b> have been used and from the geostrophic winds and humidity values the net flux has been computed twice a day. Various sources of error have been discussed, among them {{the effect of the}} ageostrophic component of the wind which for various reasons had to be neglected. No definite conclusion as to the importance of the ageostrophic component has been reached, but it seem likely that the errors caused are not very large in thia area. The method seems useful even over the rather small area studied, but an improved network with denser observations is desirable. T h e evaporation was largest during July and August and smallest during the winter months. The contribution to the run-off was largest during July-October. During April and May the evaporation was even larger than the precipitation. The yearly value of evaporation agreed well with estimates from hydrologic studies...|$|R

One {{of these cases}} is discussed in detail to illustrate the common synoptic patterns associated with these rare occurrences. Since 1895, {{there have been only}} seven snowfall events in Tallahassee when measurable snowfall (i. e., accumulations of 0. 1 inches or more) were reported. Most of these occurred in February. These snow events shared several common characteristics: (1) long wave ridging over the western Continental United States, (2) a deep trough and/or polar vortex over the Great Lakes, northeast United States, or southeast Canada, (3) a 500 -mb short wave trough propagating eastward from the southwest United States across the Gulf Coast, (4) freezing temperatures over Tallahassee and a trough oriented northeast to southwest at the 850 -mb level, (5) a cold surface anticyclone over much of the United States, (6) a weak wave of low pressure propagating eastward along a quasi-stationary surface front over the southern Gulf of Mexico, and (7) a classic snow sounding with freezing temperatures throughout most of the troposphere...|$|R
40|$|The {{two main}} {{principles}} underlying {{the use of}} isentropic maps of potential vorticity to represent dynamical processes in the atmosphere are reviewed, including the extension of those principles to take the lower boundary condition into account. {{the first is the}} familiar Lagrangian conservation principle, for potential vorticity (PV) and potential temperature, which holds approximately when advective processes dominate frictional and diabatic ones. the second is the principle of 'invertibility' of the PV distribution, which holds whether or not diabatic and frictional processes are important. the invertibility principle states that if the total mass under each isentropic surface is specified, then a knowledge of the global distribution of PV on each isentropic surface and of potential temperature at the lower boundary (which within certain limitations can be considered {{to be part of the}} PV distribution) is sufficient to deduce, diagnostically, all the other dynamical fields, such as winds, temperatures, geopotential heights, static stabilities, and vertical velocities, under a suitable balance condition. the statement that vertical velocities can be deduced is related to the well-known omega equation principle, and depends on having sufficient information about diabatic and frictional processes. Quasi-geostrophic, semigeostrophic, and 'nonlinear normal mode initialization' realizations of the balance condition are discussed. an important constraint on the mass-weighted integral of PV over a material volume and on its possible diabatic and frictional change is noted. Some basic examples are given, both from operational weather analyses and from idealized theoretical models, to illustrate the insights that can be gained from this approach and to indicate its relation to classical synoptic and air-mass concepts. Included are discussions of (a) the structure, origin and persistence of cutoff cyclones and blocking anticyclones, (b) the physical mechanisms of Rossby wave propagation, baroclinic instability, and barotropic instability, and (c) the spatially and temporally nonuniform way in which such waves and instabilities may become strongly nonlinear, as in an occluding cyclone or in the formation of an <b>upper</b> <b>air</b> shear line. Connections with principles derived from synoptic experience are indicated, such as the 'PVA rule' concerning positive vorticity advection on <b>upper</b> <b>air</b> <b>charts,</b> and the role of disturbances of <b>upper</b> <b>air</b> origin, in combination with low-level warm advection, in triggering latent heat release to produce explosive cyclonic development. In all cases it is found that time sequences of isentropic potential vorticity and surface potential temperature charts—which succinctly summarize the combined effects of vorticity advection, thermal advection, and vertical motion without requiring explicit knowledge of the vertical motion field—lead to a very clear and complete picture of the dynamics. This picture is remarkably simple in many cases of real meteorological interest. It involves, in principle, no sacrifices in quantitative accuracy beyond what is inherent in the concept of balance, as used for instance in the initialization of numerical weather forecasts...|$|R
40|$|The 30 Weather Squadron (30 WS) is {{concerned}} about strong winds observed at their northern towers without advance warning. They state that terrain influences along the extreme northern fringes of Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) {{make it difficult for}} forecasters to issue timely and accurate high wind warnings for northeasterly wind events. These events tend to occur during the winter or early spring when they are {{under the influence of the}} Great Basin high pressure weather regime. The Launch Weather Officers (LWOs) have seen these rapid wind increases in the current northern Towers 60, 70 and 71 in excess of their 35 kt operational warning threshold. For this task, the 30 WS requested the Applied Meteorology Unit (AMU) analyze data from days when these towers reported winds in excess of 35 kt and determine if there were any precursors in the observations that would allow the LWOs to better forecast and warn their operational customers for these wind events. The 30 WS provided wind tower data for the cool season (October - March) from the period January 2004 -March 20 IO. The AMU decoded and evaluated the wind tower data for 66 days identified by the 30 WS as having high-wind events. Out of the 66 event days, only 30 had wind speed observations of > or = 35 kt from at least one of the three northern towers. The AMU analyzed surface and <b>upper</b> <b>air</b> <b>charts</b> to determine the synoptic conditions for each event day along with tower peak wind speed and direction time series and wind rose charts for all 30 event days. The analysis revealed a trend on all event days in which the tower winds shifted to the northeast for a period of time before the first recorded > or = 35 kt wind speed. The time periods for the 30 event days ranged from 20 minutes to several hours, with a median value of 110 minutes. This trend, if monitored, could give the 30 WS forecasters a precursor to assist in issuing an operational warning before a high wind event occurs. The AMU recommends developing a high-wind alert capability for VAFB using a local mesoscale model to forecast these wind events. The model should incorporate all of the VAFB local data sets and have a forecast capability of between 2 to 24 hours. Such a model would allow the meteorologists at VAFB to alert the operational customers of high wind events in a timely manner so protective action could be taken...|$|R
40|$|Firstly {{the study}} the study {{introduce}} long-term trends of sea ice extent in the Arctic and Southern Ocean, their trends, seasonal variations. Then {{report on the}} sea ice condition in the southern ocean in the last season. Sea ice variations in the Arctic and in the Southern Ocean Sea ice data is indicated usually separated in the Arctic or Antarctic. This study tried to put together and summarized characteristics of their extent, seasonal differences, seasonal march and long-term trends. Although the sea ice in the Southern Ocean has increasing trend, this increasing trend {{is not enough to}} compensate the decreasing trend in the Arctic, The total sea ice in the polar regions has decreased. However total ice extent variation was modified by the seasonal march of sea ice extent in the Southern Ocean. The winter to autumn extent in the Southern Ocean leaded total sea ice area in October and November. This is due to the diverging ice field in the Southern Ocean. Sea ice area around Antarctic Continent can be separated in to several zones by latitude and season. Ice dynamics are important factor in the Antarctic sea ice change due to its high mobility. Sea ice in the Arctic is surrounded by continents and has been neither dynamic nor diverging before. It fills Arctic Ocean in winter, and it was thick. Arctic sea ice was thick and their mobility was not large, however recent decrease of ice area is making new condition of Arctic sea ice. Sea ice in the Arctic is now showing high mobility in summer and also evidenced even in winter season. Recent study introduces importance of sea ice dynamics for the ice thickness change in the Arctic. Sea ice conditions in 2015 in the Antarctic In 2014 the sea ice in the southern ocean had the record maximum of the extent since the satellite observation has started. However sea ice extent in the 2015 was almost minimum in mid-winter season. The extreme event happened in middle of July, and sea ice extent quitted. Air temperature in the Syowa station was very low in early July - 37, then suddenly jumped to - 2 C. Atmospheric circulation pattern switched from cold air burst from inland to the inflow from coastal region by the tropospheric ridge over Indian Ocean sector. AWS inland of the Antarctica, Dome F, JASE 2007, Mizuho recorded also temperature jump under the same atmospheric event. By comparing sea ice distribution in 2014 and 2015, the ice extent in the Pacific sector 120 - 140 E has changed. The <b>upper</b> <b>air</b> <b>charts</b> of both case show drastic difference in the pressure patterns in winter. Low pressure located in Bellingshausen Sea in July 2014, this worked for extent sea ice to the lower latitudes. On the other hand, low pressure located on the continent. This pressure pattern worked sea ice to be drifted eastward without expanding to the lower latitudes. The differences on sea are evident in the sea ice chart. 　We can see even single atmospheric event can change seasonal march of sea ice extent.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this study is {{generally}} the contribution to the Meteorological knowledge concerning the area of Cyprus and more specific to increase the knowledge of the characteristics of the depressions which have affect the area during the cold months of November, December, January, February and March, of the period from 1 st of November 1986 until the 31 st of March 2003. Within the knowledge of the characteristics of the depressions a data base is built and a coupling between knowledge and experience is performed in such a manner that the final product is for the benefit of weather forecasting within the area of interest. The methodology applied {{in the direction of the}} scope was based on an empirical method of recognition of depression positions. The method required a very big amount of work. The data used were surface, <b>upper</b> <b>air</b> <b>charts</b> and thermodynamic diagrams based on 00 : 00, 06 : 00, 12 : 00 and 18 : 00 universal time. The depression recognition was followed by a classification according to the direction entering the area of interest (group of depressions entering the area, “from north”, “from east”, “from south”, “from west” and a group referring to the depressions developing “into the area of interest”) and a second classification according to the month entering the area of interest (group of depressions entering the area during November, during December, January, February and during March). A climatological analysis of some parameters (such as frequency, relative frequency, time duration within the area of interest and mean, mode and minimum value of the atmospheric pressure of the innermost isobar of the depression within the area of interest) was then performed. The climatological analysis showed the west direction is the main depressions supporter of the area of interest. It provides the area with depressions with a relative frequency of 40 %, the east direction with a relative frequency of 2 % the south direction with a relative frequency of 14 %, the north direction with a relative frequency of 13 % and with only relative frequency 11 % depressions are developed into the area of interest. It was also fount that depressions entering the area from the west direction are more mature than depressions from other directions or from the depressions developing into the area. The deepest depressions are entering the area from the north, west and south direction. The biggest life span was fount as a characteristic of the depressions entering the area from the west direction during January and February. The trajectories of the depressions were also found in as much time length possible. The trajectories were classified according to the classification of surface depressions. The mean trajectories were found and the resulting frequencies were calculated. A connection between trajectories and air masses was also established and a justification concerning the weather phenomena associated with each air mass was given. It was found in general that the area of interest is affected by tropical air mass with a relative frequency of 36 %, by a polar air mass with relative frequency of 33 %, by mediterranean air mass with relative frequency of 20 %, and by other unidentified air masses with relative frequency of 11 %. It is necessary to state that the group of depressions from east is supporting the area with depressions having the shortest life time span with in the area, and that these depressions are originated mainly from southeast, namely the area of Saudi Arabia. ...|$|R
40|$|The United Arab Emirates is a {{new country}} that has had little time to {{accumulate}} a scientific heritage. Meteorologically researched and documented weather material for forecasters is virtually non-existent and that available is fragmented and anecdotal. The thesis tackles this problem by identifying weather phenomena significant to aviation in the Emirates and particularly at Abu Dhabi International Airport (ADIA). Mechanisms responsible for their development are described and applicable forecasting rules and principles are derived. Surface and <b>upper</b> <b>air</b> observation data at ADIA from 1983 to 2002 were analysed to identify the weather phenomena, their associated weather systems and for statistical analyses.

Post-processed numerical weather prediction Global Forecast Service Eta model data are used and when and where possible radar and satellite imagery. A secondary aim is to provide information of the general seasonal climate. This was achieved {{by means of a}} literature study of the dominating weather systems and the presentation of surface and <b>upper</b> <b>air</b> mean circulation <b>charts.</b> Fog is the most important weather phenomenon and serious disrupter of aviation at ADIA throughout the year. It does not occur during Shamal conditions, but fog can form well inland {{on the edge of the}} Empty Quarter at the Liwa Oasis when the Shamal wind becomes light. Contrary to local belief, fog is unlikely to occur on two, or more, consecutive nights. The Shamal can last for several days and disrupt helicopter flights to the oil rigs, while anabatic and katabatic effects often make it gustier and stronger inland at Al Ain than ADIA. While dust storms occur in strong southerly winds off the desert, the Shamal can bring dust from further afield from the north as can the previously unreported Nashi wind. The sea breeze can extend about 150 km inland to Al Ain and the Liwa Oasis.
