40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} {{to determine the effect}} on tannins on niacin utilization. In study I, feeding tannin from sorghum breakfast cereal to healthy human adults did not significantly affect <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> 1 -methylnicotinamide excretion and blood serum N 1 -methylnicotinamide and nicotinamide concentrations. However, the whole grain sorghum cereal treatment tended to produce lower <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> 1 -methylnicotinamide excretion in comparison to the polished grain sorghum cereal treatment. In study II, ten healthy subjects received 8 g of instant tea/day or no tea for 28 days in addition to constant, basal diet. Subjects receiving the tea supplementation significantly decreased <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> 1 -methylnicotinamide excretion. Feeding tea supplements had no significant effects on blood serum N 1 -methylnicotinamide and nicotinamide concentrations. In an animal study, weanling mice were fed 3 different levels of tannin sorghum diets and 3 different levels of niacin supplementation. Tannin contents in sorghum diets significantly influenced mouse <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> 1 -methylnicotinamide excretion, mouse weight gains, mouse feed consumptions and mouse feed efficiencies. The higher the tannin content in the sorghum, the lower were the response the variables tested. The higher the niacin supplementation, the higher were the mouse <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> 1 -methylnicotinamide excretion. In the survey study, anthropometric measurements, energy intake, niacin intake and beverages consumptions were calculated from the 5 -day self-recorded diets of 65 the U. S.

40|$|Ruminant {{production}} {{contributes to}} emissions of nitrogen (N) to the environment, principally ammonia (NH 3), nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and di-nitrogen (N 2) to air, nitrate (NO 3 -) to groundwater and particulate N to surface waters. Variation in dietary N intake will particularly affect excretion of <b>urinary</b> <b>N,</b> {{which is much}} more vulnerable to losses than is faecal N. Our objective is to review dietary effects on the level and form of N excreted in cattle urine, as well as its consequences for emissions of N 2 O. The quantity of N excreted in urine varies widely. <b>Urinary</b> <b>N</b> excretion, in particular that of urea N, is decreased upon reduction of dietary N intake or an increase in the supply of energy to the rumen microorganisms and to the host animal itself. Most of the N in urine (from 50 % to well over 90 %) is present in the form of urea. Other nitrogenous components include purine derivatives (PD), hippuric acid, creatine and creatinine. Excretion of PD is related to rumen microbial protein synthesis, and that of hippuric acid to dietary concentration of degradable phenolic acids. The N concentration of cattle urine ranges from 3 to 20 g/l. High-dietary mineral levels increase urine volume and lead to reduced <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> concentration as well as reduced urea concentration in plasma and milk. In lactating dairy cattle, variation in urine volume affects the relationship between milk urea and <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> excretion, which hampers the use of milk urea as an accurate indicator of <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> excretion. Following its deposition in pastures or in animal houses, ubiquitous microorganisms in soil and waters transform <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> components into ammonium (NH 4 +), and thereafter into NO 3 - and ultimately in N 2 accompanied with the release of N 2 O. Urinary hippuric acid, creatine and creatinine decompose more slowly than urea. Hippuric acid may act as a natural inhibitor of N 2 O emissions, but inhibition conditions have not been defined properly yet. Environmental and soil conditions at the site of urine deposition or manure application strongly influence N 2 O release. Major dietary strategies to mitigating N 2 O emission from cattle operations include reducing dietary N content or increasing energy content, and increasing dietary mineral content to increase urine volume. For further reduction of N 2 O emission, an integrated animal nutrition and excreta management approach is required...|$|E
40|$|Milk urea {{nitrogen}} (MUN) {{has been}} introduced {{as a means to}} estimate urinary nitrogen (N) excretion and protein status of dairy cattle. For Holstein cows, the amount of <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> excreted (g/d) was originally re-ported to be 12. 54 × MUN (mg/dl), but recently <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> (g/d) was reported to equal 17. 64 × MUN (mg/dl). The objectives of the present study were to evaluate models to predict <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> and expected MUN, by using older and newer data sets, and to quantify changes that may have occurred in MUN measurements over time. Two data sets were used for model evaluation. Data set 1 was from the spring of 1998 and data set 2 was from the spring of 1999. Similar cows and diets were used in both studies. By using data set 1, the newer model underestimated MUN by an average of 3. 8 mg/dl, whereas the older model was accurate. By using data set 2, the older model overestimated MUN by 4. 8 mg/ dl, but the newer model was accurate. In the period between the two studies, the MUN measured appeared to decrease by an average of 4. 0 mg/dl. By using current wet chemistry methods to analyze for MUN, <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> (mg/dl) can be predicted as 0. 026 × MUN (mg/dl) × body weight (kg). Because of changes in methodology that occurred in the fall of 1998, target MUN concentrations have decreased to 8. 5 to 11. 5 mg/dl for most dairy herds compared with previous target concentrations of 12 to 16 mg/dl.

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Tryptophan is the {{precursor}} of serotonin and niacin (vitamin B 3). The latter {{is critical for}} normal cellular metabolism. Tryptophan and niacin can be deficient in patients with serotonin producing neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Niacin deficiency can lead to severe symptoms including pellagra. In serotonin producing NET patients data on niacin status are scarce and niacin supplementation receives hardly attention. We aimed to assess niacin status before and after supplementation in these patients. METHODS: We identified serotonin producing NET patients who had received oral niacin supplementation (mean dose 144 mg daily) for tryptophan deficiency and/or pellagra associated symptoms. Pre-supplementation plasma tryptophan levels and niacin status based on the urinary niacin metabolite N 1 -methylnicotinamide (N 1 -MN) before (n = 42) and after start supplementation (in 34 paired samples) were assessed. Reference values for <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> 1 -MN levels were established in 133 healthy individuals. RESULTS: The mean pre-supplementation plasma tryptophan level was 31. 8 ± 9. 7 µmol/l (reference value 40. 0 - 70. 0 µmol/l). Pre-supplementation <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> 1 -MN levels were lower in patients (median 17. 9 µmol/ 24 h (24 h), range 2. 6 - 70. 3) compared to healthy controls (median 43. 7 µmol/ 24 h, range 9. 5 - 169. 3, p < 0. 0001) and below normal in 45 % of the patients. Niacin supplementation increased <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> 1 -MN levels to high normal levels (median 55. 5 µmol/ 24 h, range 7. 4 - 489. 0) in 86 % of the niacin deficient patients. CONCLUSION: In serotonin producing NET patients niacin deficiency is prevalent. Therefore, <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> 1 -MN deserves {{to be included in}} their standard biochemical evaluation. Niacin supplementation normalizes niacin status in most niacin deficient serotonin producing NET patients. A prospective study is warranted...|$|E
40|$|Successful {{management}} of nitrogen (N) excretion {{is important for}} sustainable pork production. Two experiments were conducted and their objectives were to study the effect of dietary protein and fibre on N excretion patterns and to relate plasma urea (PU) to <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> excretion. In the first experiment, three dietary protein contents (high, 197; medium, 169; low, 138 g kg- 1) and two levels of fibre (low and high) were tested. Diets (wheat, barley, soybean meal; oat-hulls as the fibre source) were formulated to an equal digestible energy (DE) content (3. 25 Meal DE kg- 1) and at least 2. 18 g digestible lysine per Meal DE, and were supplemented with Lys, Met, Trp, Thr, Ile, or Val. Pigs (32 Â± 3. 4 kg; n = 42) were housed in confinement-type metabolism crates for 19 d. On d 10 or 11, catheters were installed by cranial vena cava venipuncture. Daily feeding rates were adjusted to three times maintenance and daily rations were halved to two equal meals. Faeces and urine were collected from d 15 to 19. Five blood samples were collected in two-h intervals on d 16 and 19. Faecal N, <b>urinary</b> <b>N,</b> and total N excretion were reduced linearly with a reduction of dietary protein content (P 0. 1 0). Plasma urea increased after feeding, peaked at 4 h and then decreased toward pre-feeding concentrations. A linear relationship of <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> to PU concentration (R 2 = 0. 66) was observed. In the second experiment, effects of dietary protein content (high, 185; and low, 157 g kg- 1) and fibre sources on N excretion patterns were studied in a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement. The three fibre sources were control, soybean hulls (SH; 15 %), and sugar beet pulp (SBP; 20 %). Diets were formulated to 3. 3 Meal DE kg- 1 and 2. 4 g digestible Lys per Meal DE, and were supplemented with Lys, Met, Trp, Thr, lie, or Val. Pigs (30. 5 Â± 3 kg; n = 36) were housed in confinement-type metabolism crates, with restricted access to feed (3 x maintenance DE) from d 1 to 18, and free access to feed from d 19 to 26. Faeces and urine were collected from d 15 to 18 and d 23 to 26, and blood samples on d 17 and 25. With restricted access to feed, faecal N (as % of N intake) was increased 3 percentage units for low compared to high protein content, and increased 4 percentage units for SH and 6. 5 percentage units for SBP compared to control (P 0. 10), and reduced for SH (27 g d- 1; P < 0. 05) compared to control (31 g d- 1), while was intermediate for SBP (29 g d- 1). A linear relationship of <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> to PU concentration was observed with both restricted (R 2 = 0. 66) and free access to feed (R 2 = 0. 71). Reduction of dietary protein content is {{an efficient way to}} reduce total and <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> excretion, which may reduce ammonia emission. Inclusion of fibre sources high in fermentable fibre shifted N excretion from urine N to faeces N while fibre sources resistant to fermentation did not have any effects on N excretion patterns. Combined effects of dietary protein content and fibre reduced <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> excretion further than single effects. Level of feed intake is an important consideration when effectiveness of a nutrient management strategy is studied. Diets with a low protein content and containing synthetic AA should be studied using pigs with free access to feed to verify that N retention is maintained.

With few exceptions, however, no attention was paid {{in these studies}} to the possible effects of hyperinsulinemia on urea nitrogen (N) pool size {{and the consequences of}} such changes on the calculated rates of protein, lipid, and carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation. We have determined the effects of euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps on urea N pool size, <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> excretion, and rates of protein, lipid, and CHO oxidation (measured by indirect calorimetry) in six normal men. Insulin infusion (1 mU. kg- 1. min- 1) increased peripheral venous insulin concentration from 7 +/- 1. 2 (mean +/- SE) to 51 +/- 4 microU/ml. Glucose concentration was clamped at 84 +/- 1. 1 mg/dl. Between 0 (preclamp) and 360 min (end of clamp), blood urea N concentration decreased from 17. 2 +/- 1. 1 to 11 +/- 0. 8 mg/dl (P less than. 001), and the urea N pool decreased from 604 +/- 41 to 388 +/- 30 mmol (P less than. 001).

40|$|Nitrogen (N) {{rejections}} are {{a problem}} of importance in cattle production. In pasture, the amounts of N rejected by the cattle are large since grass N content exceeds the ‘animals’ requirements.

The trial paddocks were fertilized with compost, slurry or mineral N and grazed during 7 days by 35 dairy cows in late lactation. Milk urea concentration was determined in tank milk samples every day. Urine samples were taken from each cow at the 3 rd and the 5 th day after the entry in the grazing plot. Urine N and creatinin were determined to quantify urine N excretion. These observed values were compared to urine N excretion data obtained from dry matter intake and grass N content.

40|$|A {{survey of}} 715 Holstein dairy farms in Pennsylvania {{was used to}} {{construct}} demographics for the average Holstein dairy farm. The average Holstein dairy farm was composed of 69 lactating cows; 11 nonlactating, pregnant cows; 44 heifers; and 18 calves. Milk production averaged 27. 3 kg (60. 0 lb). Crop area averaged 73. 6 ha. Milk production, crop area and type, average county yields, and herd animal groups were used to construct a typical feeding program for these farms. Typical rations were constructed for six feeding groups (three milk production groups, one nonlactating group, two heifer groups) to meet milk production, pregnancy, and growth requirements. Rations were constructed based on three forage qualities (excellent, average, and poor) typically observed on Pennsylvania dairy farms. Data for animal description (milk production, body weight, growth, and pregnancy status) and ration components and amounts consumed for each animal group were input into the excretion model of the Dairy Nutrient Planner computer program (DNP). Excretion of fecal N and dry matter (DM), <b>urinary</b> <b>N,</b> and total P and K were produced for each animal group and used to assess potential volatile losses of N. Work at the Marshak Dairy, New Bolton Center, indicates the majority of <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> is rapidly lost as ammonia from dairy facilities.

40|$|Nitrogen (N) balance was {{determined}} in 36 pigs (BW 24 to 30 kg) fed diets inducing different ileal endogenous N losses (ENL). We tested {{the hypothesis that}} enhanced ENL may be indicative of a higher recycling of endogenous proteins that will induce a greater <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> loss and a lower efficiency of the dietary N utilization for retention. The corn-starch-based diets contained either soy concentrate (SC), soybean meal (SBM), a mixture of toasted and untoasted soybean meal (mSBM), dehulled-toasted rapeseed cake (RC 1), non-dehulled-toasted rapeseed cake (RC 2), or dehulled-untoasted rapeseed cake (RC 3). The diets were balanced for their content of apparent ileal digestible (ID) CP (108 g/kg feed) and apparent ID of Lys, Thr, Met+Cys, Trp, and Ile. Feeding level was 2. 7 times ME for maintenance per kilogram BW· 75 and restricted to 88 % of the requirements for ID Lys as the first-limiting amino acid. During a 5 -d period, urine and feces were collected daily in metabolism cages. Compared with the SC diet (low END, the diets with SBM (medium ENL) and mSBM (high END resulted in a greater (P <. 05) <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> excretion.

A total of 50 crossbred barrows with an initial BW of 13. 5 kg (SD = 1. 0) were used in an N balance study. A Met-deficient basal diet (BD) was formulated to contain an adequate amount of all amino acids (AA) for 10 – 20 kg pigs except for Met. The two reference diets were prepared by supplementing the BD with 0. 4 or 0. 8 g L-Met/kg {{at the expense of}} corn starch, and an equivalent concentration of D-Met was added to the BD for the two test diets. The pigs were adapted to the experimental diets for 5 d and then total but separated collection of feces and urine was conducted for 4 d according to the marker-to-marker procedure. Nitrogen intakes were similar across the treatments. Fecal N output was not affected by Met supplementation regardless of source and consequently apparent N digestibility did not change. Conversely, there was a negative linear response (P < 0. 01) to Met supplementation with both Met isomers in <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> output, which resulted in increased retained N (g/ 4 d) and N retention (% of intake).

40|$|We {{described}} {{the effects of}} two East African browses, Acacia brevispica and Sesbania sesban, on nitrogen metabolism of sheep and goats. The A. brevispica had {{a substantial amount of}} proanthocyanidins (condensed tannins); S. sesban did not. The browses were fed at three levels in combination with vetch (Vicia dasycarpa) and teff straw (Eragrostis abyssinica). Fecal N, N balance, and plasma urea N (PUN) were estimated with intact animals. Ruminal ammonia (RuA) and VFA concentrations were estimated with ruminally fistulated animals. <b>Urinary</b> <b>N</b> loss, PUN, RuA and VFA concentrations were higher for S. sesban diets than for A. brevispica diets. Fecal N was highest with diets including A. brevispica due to high levels of fecal neutral-detergent insoluble N. Nitrogen retention was highest for diets including S. sesban. Nitrogen retention was adequate for A. brevispica diets because low <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> compensated for high fecal N. Four hypotheses describe possible effects of tannis on N metabolism: 1) escape of protein from the rumen to the lower tract; 2) increased microbial yield; 3) increase in N-containing endogenous products; and 4) protein made indigestible in tannin-protein complexes. The effect of tannins in A. brevispica on N metabolism can best be described by the formation of indigestible tannin-protein complexes, although increased production of endogenous products is also possible...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Urinary {{nitrogen}} (N) {{is rapidly}} converted to ammonia (NH 3) during manure collection and storage, whereas faecal N {{is converted to}} NH 3 at a much slower rate. Developing nutritional strategies to shift N excretion from urine to faeces may reduce NH 3 from dairy manure which is implicated in reduced air quality. Previous work suggests that increasing post-ruminal fermentation may reduce <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> and consequently manure NH 3 losses (Gressley and Armentano, 2005).

40|$|Urinary {{incontinence}} (UI), {{more prevalent}} in women and influencing their functional decline, increases with age. Current longitudinal study with two data collection in 2005 - 2006 and 2011 compares the functional profile of urinary continence and incontinence in elderly women. Sixty-eight women were divided into females with <b>urinary</b> continence (CG; <b>n</b> = 62) and females with <b>urinary</b> incontinence (IG; <b>n</b> = 6). Dependent variables measured were obesity and body adiposity indexes and functional fitness. Data were given in means with standard deviation (±) and analyzed by the independent t-test (p < 0. 05). There were six cases of UI. In the first evaluation group differences occurred for waist circumference (CG: 85. 3 ± 9. 7 cm; IG: 91. 2 ± 12. 4 cm; t=- 2. 267; p < 0. 05) and cardiorespiratory fitness (CG: 517. 9 ± 67. 3 m; IG: 463. 0 ± 85. 9 m; t = 2. 571; p < 0. 05). CG had a better functional profile, excepting flexibility and lower limbs strength, in the second evaluation. Women with UI had higher waist circumference and lower cardiorespiratory fitness. This {{may be due to}} the relationship between the variables and greater abdominal compression and functional decline. Results show that future public health strategies should focus on these factors to decrease the risk of people developing UI and to improve physical-functional and psycho-social benefits to elderly women...|$|R

40|$|Twenty-one {{multiparous}} Holstein cows in {{the late}} stages of their lactation period were used in complete randomized design to investigate the effect of rumen degradable protein on milk urea nitrogen (MUN) and some blood metabolites. Experimental periods were 6 weeks in length, with days 1 to 14 used for adjustment and weeks 3 to week 6 used for sampling (urine, blood, and milk). Three concentrations of a rumen-degradable protein (RDP) supplement according to National Research Council recommendations (9. 3, 11. 4, and 14 % of dry matter intake) were treatments. Dietary RDP content altered both total <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> and <b>urinary</b> <b>N</b> concentration, leading to increased urinary output. Estimations for microbial protein yield were compared with the measured excretion of purine derivative as yeast RNA equivalent, in urine. No significant effect of concentration of RDP supplement was detected on microbial N production. Plasma cholesterol concentration decreased linearity by increasing RDP concentration in diets (P well as triglyceride concentration in plasma, {{was not associated with}} dietary RDP concentration.

Individual samples of faeces and urine were collected to assess N excretions from cows in the paddocks. The urea content in milk from the tank or from the individual cows was also measured. N intake was higher on day 3 compared to day 5 (465 vs 425 g d- 1, P< 0. 001) and in September as compared to June (488 vs 425 g d- 1, P< 0. 001) but was not influenced by the fertilization type.

40|$|Background: Urinary {{biomarkers}} {{are needed}} to improve the care and {{reduce the cost of}} managing bladder cancer. Current biomarkers struggle to identify both high and low-grade cancers due to differing molecular pathways. Changes in microRNA (miR) expression are seen in urothelial carcinogenesis in a phenotype-specific manner. We hypothesised that urinary miRs reflecting low- and high-grade pathways could detect bladder cancers and overcome differences in genetic events seen within the disease. Methods: We investigated <b>urinary</b> samples (<b>n</b> ¼ 121) from patients with bladder cancer (n ¼ 68) and age-matched controls (n ¼ 53). Fifteen miRs were quantified using real-time PCR. Results: We found that miR is stable within urinary cells despite adverse handling and detected differential expression of 10 miRs from patients with cancer and controls (miRs 15 a/ 15 b/ 24 - 1 / 27 b/ 100 / 135 b/ 203 / 212 / 328 / 1224, ANOVA Po 0. 05).
