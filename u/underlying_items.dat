Improper management of {{end-of-life vehicles}} endangers environment and social life in Malaysia. Excessive water, air and soil pollution are among the primary effects of improper end-of-life vehicle management. These negative impacts have led to an initiative to develop a framework for establishing end-of-life vehicle management system in Malaysia. A set of preliminary factors and <b>underlying</b> <b>items</b> have been identified from previous research efforts. Then, a large survey, with 300 respondents comprising of vehicle manufacturers and distributors, part dealers, and end-of-life vehicle collectors; and high response rate, was conducted. Responses of the survey were factor-analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 20. As a result, the eight success factors namely management responsibility, performance management, capacity management, resource management, stakeholder responsibility, education and awareness, improvement and awareness, and cost management in implementing end-of-life vehicle management system in Malaysia and 33 <b>underlying</b> <b>items</b> are identified and thoroughly discussed. By conducting reliability analysis, all eight success factors are determined to be reliable. Linear relationship among the factors is then confirmed using structural equation modeling. Upon confirmation, the proposed framework containing factors and items, can be valuable for supporting authorities in establishing end-of-life vehicle management system not only in Malaysia, but also in other countries without proper end-of-life vehicle management system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Venous blood {{sampling}} {{is a common}} procedure in health care. It is strictly regulated by national and international guidelines. Deviations from guidelines due to human mistakes can cause patient harm. Validated questionnaires for health care personnel {{can be used to}} assess preventable "near misses" [...] i. e. potential errors and nonconformities during venous {{blood sampling}} practices that could transform into adverse events. However, no validated questionnaire that assesses nonconformities in venous blood sampling has previously been presented. The aim was to test a recently developed questionnaire in self reported venous blood sampling practices for validity and reliability. Findings We developed a questionnaire to assess deviations from best practices during venous blood sampling. The questionnaire contained questions about patient identification, test request management, test tube labeling, test tube handling, information search procedures and frequencies of error reporting. For content validity, the questionnaire was confirmed by experts on questionnaires and venous blood sampling. For reliability, test-retest statistics were used on the questionnaire answered twice. The final venous blood sampling questionnaire included 19 questions out of which 9 had in total 34 <b>underlying</b> <b>items.</b> It was found to have content validity. The test-retest analysis demonstrated that the items were generally stable. In total, 82 % of the items fulfilled the reliability acceptance criteria. Conclusions The questionnaire could be used for assessment of "near miss" practices that could jeopardize patient safety and gives several benefits instead of assessing rare adverse events only. The higher frequencies of "near miss" practices allows for quantitative analysis of the effect of corrective interventions and to benchmark preanalytical quality not only at the laboratory/hospital level but also at the health care unit/hospital ward. </p...|$|E
40|$|Technology {{education}} is a new school subject in comparison with other subjects within the Swedish compulsory school system. Research in technology education shows that technology teachers lack experience of and support for assessment {{in comparison with the}} long-term experiences that other teachers use in their subjects. This becomes especially apparent when technology teachers assess students’ knowledge in and about technological systems. This study thematically analysed the assessment views of eleven technology teachers in a Swedish context. Through the use of in-depth semi-structured qualitative interviews, their elaborated thoughts on assessing knowledge about technological systems within the technology subject (for ages 13 – 16) were analysed. The aim was to describe the teachers’ assessment views in terms of types of knowledge, and essential knowledge in relation to a progression from basic to advanced understanding of technological systems. The results showed three main themes that the interviewed teachers said they consider when performing their assessment of technological systems; understanding (a) a system’s structure, (b) its relations outside the system boundary and (c) its historical context and technological change. Each theme included several <b>underlying</b> <b>items</b> that the teachers said they use in a progressive manner when they assess their students’ basic, intermediate and advanced level of understanding technological systems. In conclusion, the results suggest that the analysed themes can provide a basis for further discussion about defining a progression for assessing students’ understanding about technological systems. However, the findings also need to be examined critically as the interviewed teachers’ views on required assessment levels showed an imbalance; few students were said to reach beyond the basic level, {{but at the same time}} most assessment items lay on the intermediate and advanced levels...|$|E

A further aim was to propose a metric for assessing the adequacy of community mental health services in meeting ongoing needs over longer stretches of time. We made four prospective follow-up studies of CAN assessments of patients with severe mental illness in community-based mental health care. A factor analysis (n= 741) gave support for a three-factor model, comprising only 60 % of the CAN items. Need assessments (n= 92) in 1997 and 2003 were compared at both the summed total and the underlying item levels of the CAN. The mean total scores did not change, yet there were {{significant changes in the}} <b>underlying</b> <b>items.</b> Changes in mean number of needs between 1997 and 1999 were measured (n= 262) with both total scores, summed over all CAN items, and with sub-total scores, summed over two sets of items reflecting the social services and the psychiatric services respectively. As indicated by the sub-total scores, all significant changes occurred within the psychiatric services, a result not possible to discern from the total scores. The Met Needs Index (MNI), defined by us as the aggregate measure of beneficial outcome, indicated that needs in general were met during 71 % of the intervals between the annuals assessments from 1997 through 2004. However, the variation among particular items was large. In conclusion, the summary scores typically used as outcome measures are likely to conceal meaningful variation at the item level. Nevertheless, sub-total scores, being more transparent, might be more useful in outcome assessment. The MNI is a continuous, normally distributed metric, estimable over any number of consecutive assessments, which seems suitable for assessing the achieved benefit of services for patients with long-term ongoing needs...|$|E

The aim {{of the present study was}} to analyze the measurement equivalence of the Day Reconstruction Method in its brief version, using nationally representative samples from Finland, Poland, and Spain obtained within the COURAGE in Europe project. The goodness-of-fit of a two-correlated-factors model and the reliability of the scores obtained were assessed. Cross-country invariance was tested employing a multiple group confirmatory factor analysis, through sequential constraint imposition. In each country, measurement invariance was tested across time frames (morning, afternoon and evening) and days of the week (weekday and weekend). The results found support for the hypothesis of a two-correlated-factors (positive and negative affect) structure; the reliability of the positive, the negative and the net affect scores showed appropriate values. A high equivalence across the three national samples was found: all items except one showed strong measurement invariance indicating that respondents from Finland, Poland, and Spain attribute the same meaning to the latent construct under study, and the levels of the <b>underlying</b> <b>items</b> are equal in all three countries. Similar results were found for the measurement equivalence across time frames and days of the week.

30|$|On {{the second}} level of our {{two-level}} coding we aggregated the 97 level-one-items from the fine-grained coding process into one partial credit item for each competence facet and each scenario (4  ×  3  =  12 partial credit items—which we denote as level-two-items). For this purpose, the response patterns in the level-one-items of one competence facet and one scenario were extracted and ordered by the sum score of the items. Thus, a low sum score is a first indicator of a low quality of the solution. Subsequently, experts rated each response pattern {{with regard to the}} quality of the solution as compared to other response patterns. Experts not only decided on cutoff values between lower and higher partial credits but they also defined weightings or necessary preconditions with regard to the content of the problem scenario. Assigning credit points to each response pattern resulted in one (level 2) partial credit item per facet and per scenario, each of which had four to seven categories. Thus, the estimation of competence scores for each competence facet is based on only three items. Nevertheless, these partial credit items provide rich information (e.g., 3 partial credit items with 5 categories each equal 12 dichotomous items). Besides the strong qualitative verification of the dimensionality that comes along with the assignment of the partial credits, the main reason to include just one item per scenario in the IRT analysis is to avoid local item dependence (LID). A major problem in evaluating complex scenarios is the strong local dependence of the items that refer to the same scenario, and the corresponding LID is known to bias the reliability, item difficulty estimates, as well as variance and covariance estimates, as has been shown by many authors (see, e.g., Brandt 2012; Sireci et al. 1991; Wainer et al. 2007; Yen 1993). A further option to consider the scenario-based LID might have been to model the observed dependencies, for example, via a hierarchical model such as the Rasch testlet model (Wang and Wilson 2005). The given covariance structure of the testlet specific factors, however, typically is not as proposed by the model (which supposes that they are uncorrelated), and furthermore, the covariances can change depending on the considered (sub-)sample. Such changes then lead to changes for the calculation of the general factor, making the calculation of the latter sample dependent. This also the reason why these models are not used in the known large scale assessments, such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) or the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). We therefore also preferred an approach that avoids LID by the design of the <b>underlying</b> <b>items</b> instead of an approach based on modeling.|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis presents {{research on the}} integration and transfer of knowledge from the specialized field of urban microclimatology into the generic field of urban design. Both fields are studied {{in order to identify}} crosslinks and reveal gaps. The main research question of the research is: How can the design of urban neighbourhoods contribute to microclimates that support physical well-being and what kind of information and form of presentation does the urban designer need in order to make design decisions regarding such urban microclimates? This question consists of two parts, which are addressed separately in the first two parts of the dissertation. Part 1 concerns an assessment of relevant knowledge on urban design by literature review, followed by a field study into the use of expert information in the urban design process. Part 2 discusses the influence of the urban environment on its microclimate and, consequently, the living quality of its inhabitants – both by means of literature review. Combined, Parts 1 and 2 serve as a basis for a framework for a design-decision support tool, which is discussed in Part 3. This tool is proposed as a means to integrate knowledge of the urban microclimate into the urban design process, bridging an observed gap. Urban design is concerned with shaping the physical environment to facilitate urban life in all its aspects. This is a complex task, which requires the integration and translation of different stakeholder interests into a proposition for the realization of physical-spatial constructs in the urban environment. Such a proposition comprises different planning elements in the following categories: spatial-functional organization, city plan, public space design and rules for architecture. During the design process, the urban designer has to deal with incomplete, often contradictory and/or changing constraints and quality demands as well as other uncertainties. He/ she handles this complexity by starting with a small selection of constraints, iteratively working to a design solution by incorporating an increasing number of constraints. The selection of constraints is subjective, depending on the design frame of the individual designer. In order to make design decisions, the urban designer requires diverse information. To establish how urban designers collect information and which formats and information levels they prefer, field research among Dutch urban designers was carried out. This consisted of a series of exploratory interviews and an online questionnaire. The results indicate that dissemination of expert knowledge to urban design should be focused on the orientation and sketch phases of the design process and should provide different layers of detail, using mainly visual information accompanied by explanatory text. The results furthermore show a remarkable discrepancy between the assigned significance of the urban microclimate for urban design and the frequency of inquiry on this topic; almost all interviewees and respondents consider the subject to be important, but a majority of them seldom collect information on it. This signifies a gap in the knowledge transfer process. It is important to bridge this gap, because the urban microclimate has {{a significant impact on the}} physical well-being of people. All components of the urban microclimate – solar radiation, daylight, wind, air quality and sound – affect the physical well-being of people, whether separately or in conjunction. Some of these effects are immediate, such as heat stress and noise annoyance; others develop over a longer period of overexposure or underexposure, such as pulmonary and respiratory diseases. Some cause discomfort, for example sleep disturbance; others can be life- threatening, such as heat stroke or skin and lung cancer. It is therefore vital that the urban microclimate is given considerable attention in the urban design process. The urban microclimate is to a large extent influenced by the city’s morphology, materialization and landscaping. This influence is exerted through different physical principles, such as reflection, absorption and evapotranspiration. Basic knowledge on how and to what extent the urban environment affects the urban microclimate and of the underlying physical principles, supported by design guidelines and examples/ reference projects, will enable urban designers to estimate the effects of their design choices on the microclimate themselves better, and help them create conditions for urban microclimates that favour physical well-being. In order to make this information available to the urban designer in a way that corresponds to his/her working process, a framework for a design-decision support tool was set up. Requirements regarding form and function were derived from the field of urban design, while requirements regarding content were derived from the field of urban microclimatology. The tool is proposed to be a web-based knowledge base, consisting of five main menu categories: “climate elements”, “plan elements”, “principles”, “guidelines” and “example projects”. Each category provides access to separate pages for <b>underlying</b> <b>items,</b> containing different layers of information, from general to detailed, that can be accessed through collapse menus or click-through functions. Hyperlinks between related items are provided to support different ways to access information. The main menu further gives access to background information on physical well-being and regulations and standards. Separate item pages can be added to a ‘shopping cart’, enabling customised information selection for a specific design at hand. Providing the necessary content for the tool requires further translation of expert knowledge into design information as well as additional research regarding: the plain and simple formulation of physical phenomena related to the urban environment; the integration of expert knowledge of separate microclimatological elements; the incongruity of parameters in microclimatological studies and urban design plan elements; and the presentation of information consistent with design and (design) communication purposes as opposed to evaluation purposes. To illustrate how expert studies can be rendered into design information, the impact of three selected plan elements - Floor Space Index (FSI), Ground Space Index (GSI) and orientation - on solar irradiation and wind was examined with the aid of numerical simulation tools. The results of the calculations for both climate elements were integrated in order to identify conflicts and matches. The emphasis of the study lay on showing trends and generating generic knowledge. Such knowledge is required to fill the proposed design-decision support tool with content. Answering the main research question, it can be concluded that various aspects relating to the morphology, materialization and landscaping of urban neighbourhoods can be employed to create conditions for a distinctive microclimate; urban microclimates often deviate substantially from the regional climate, and even vary within a few meters. Designing urban microclimates needs to be done with care as they affect the physical well-being of people significantly. In order to be able to do this, the urban designer needs information that ties in with his/her way of working and cognitive process. However, expert knowledge from the field of urban microclimatology does not fulfil this requirement and needs to be translated to information for urban design purposes. Aiming to give direction to this translation and facilitate the dissemination of expert urban microclimate knowledge to the urban design process, this research proposes a framework for a design-decision support tool. Requirements for the framework were derived from both the field of urban design and the field of urban microclimatology. A tool created according to the proposed framework will enable urban designers to practice climate-sensitive urban design, and, thus contribute to the physical well-being of people...|$|E

40|$|Background: Many {{states require}} {{screening}} of individuals arrested for {{driving under the}} influence (DUI) of alcohol to determine recidivism risk and the need for treatment based on severity of alcohol problems. Several screening instruments use DSM-IV criteria for alcohol abuse and depen-dence to assess alcohol problems in this population, but whether they adequately measure alcohol problems in individuals with DUIs has not been examined. In addition, gender differences in DUI samples suggest that female offenders have more severe alcohol problems than male offenders. The current study examines differences in alcohol criteria functioning by DUI history and gender using an item response theory (IRT) approach. Methods: Data from diagnostic interviews with 8, 605 participants in the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism, including 1, 655 who ever reported a DUI arrest (20 % women), were used to examine differences in alcohol criteria functioning between men and women with and without DUIs. The factor <b>underlying</b> <b>item</b> response was conceptualized as unidimensional, representing alcohol problem severity. Results: Social ⁄ interpersonal problems, larger ⁄ longer, and inability ⁄ persistent desire to quit displayed greater discrimination of IRT-defined alcohol problem severity among individuals wit...|$|R
30|$|First, {{to ensure}} {{construct}} validity of the scales, factor analyses and item analyses were performed. An exploratory factor analysis (with promax rotation) was performed in order to check whether both leadership styles were <b>underlying</b> the <b>items.</b> Based on this factor analysis, one item from the instructional leadership scale was deleted due to cross loadings. Next, reliability analyses were conducted for the scales which showed good Cronbach’s alpha values of 0.88 for the instructional leadership scale and 0.94 for the transformational leadership scale.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} a procedure based on generalizability theory for assessing the adequacy of item groupings generated by means of a domain-referenced testing system. The procedure is based on an exploration of the extent to which items are grouped into homogeneous sets with similar levels of difficulty, when the sets are defined on the basis of a logical analysis of the perceived skills <b>underlying</b> the <b>items.</b> In addition, an example of the use of the developed analytic procedure is presented...|$|R
40|$|This talk {{focuses on}} the {{identification}} of respondents with cheating behaviour to educational or psychometric tests. Cheating behaviour is often observed when some examinee with low ability level, tries to get correct responses (in some way or another) to get higher grades. This results usually in a response pattern that does not fit the <b>underlying</b> <b>item</b> response theory (IRT) model and severely affects the estimation of ability level. Until now, several indices of misfit have been proposed, and they seem accurate for detecting cheating (as well as other misfitting behaviours). Unfortunately, none of these indexes permit: (a) to determine which type of behaviour is encountered, and (b) to propose a corrected estimation of the examinee’s ability level. The purpose of this talk is to present Raîche’s multidimensional model {{as an extension of}} the usual IRT models but incorporating additional person parameters to characterize misfitting behaviour. Emphasis is put on a simple model with personal pseudo-guessing variation to detect trends in cheating. Results from a simulation study indicate that, in the absence of cheating, the multidimensional model returns similar estimates than the traditional IRT models, while in the presence of cheating, the person pseudo-guessing parameter is an accurate index of misfit and the person ability estimates are less biased than its traditional counterpart...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{develop and}} {{validate}} parallel short forms {{for the assessment}} of general anxiety in cardiovascular rehabilitation patients, that facilitate repeated measurement over time without contamination from residual practice effect variance. Design: Development of the parallel short forms using Rasch analysis. Validation study. Setting: Cardiac rehabilitation centres in Germany. Subjects: Cardiovascular rehabilitation patients. Interventions: Not applicable. Main measures: Parallel short forms PaSA-cardio, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Short Form Health Survey SF- 12 and Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders. Results: Each version of the parallel short forms (PaSA-cardio-I and PaSA-cardio-II) comprises ten items. The two forms fitted to the Rasch model with a non-significant item–trait interaction (PaSA-cardio-I: chisquare = 39. 49, degrees of freedom = 30, probability = 0. 12; PaSA-cardio-II: chi-square = 26. 56, degrees of freedom = 30, probability = 0. 65). Person-separation reliability was 0. 75 / 0. 76. Unidimensionality could be verified. Correlation between the two models was 0. 94 and 0. 95, and correlations with the <b>underlying</b> <b>item</b> bank were 0. 95 and 0. 93. Validity could be confirmed. The area under the curve was between 0. 88 and 0. 97 for PaSA-cardio-I and between 0. 92 and 0. 95 for PaSA-cardio-II.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of treatments for depression is often measured by comparing observed total scores on self-report inventories, in both clinical practice and research. However, {{the occurrence of}} response shifts (changes in subjects' values, or their standards for measurement) may limit the validity of such comparisons. As most psychological treatments for depression are aimed at changing patients' values and frame of reference, response shifts are likely to occur {{over the course of}} such treatments. In this article, we tested whether response shifts occurred over the course of treatment in an influential randomized clinical trial. Using confirmatory factor analysis, measurement models <b>underlying</b> <b>item</b> scores on the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck & Beamesderfer, 1974) of the National Institute of Mental Health Treatment of Depression Collaborative Research Program (Elkin, Parloff, Hadley, & Autry, 1985) were analyzed. Compared with before treatment, after-treatment item scores appeared to overestimate depressive symptomatology, measurement errors were smaller, and correlations between constructs were stronger. These findings indicate a response shift, in the sense that participants seem to get better at assessing their level of depressive symptomatology. Comparing measurement models of patients receiving psychotherapy and medication suggested that the aforementioned effects were more apparent in the psychotherapy groups. Consequently, comparisons of observed total scores on self-report inventories may yield confounded measures of treatment efficacy. © 2013 American Psychological Association...|$|R
40|$|The Frankfurt Complaint Questionnaire (FCQ) was de-signed to {{evaluate}} the subjective symptoms of schizo-phrenics. Several validation studies of the FCQ using principal components analyses (PCA) have shown one-, two-, or four-factor solutions. The present study was conducted using FCQ data on 310 schizophrenics who met the ICD- 10 criteria for F 20 (schizophrenia) disorder. Using several guidelines to select the num-ber of factors, the PCA yielded one factor. This result suggests a unidimensionality <b>underlying</b> FCQ <b>items.</b> A new scale comprising 24 items was derived from those items with higher weights in the first factor.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} psychometric {{properties}} of the Caregiver Strain Index Expanded with those of the original Caregiver Strain Index among partners of stroke patients. Design and subjects: Cross-sectional validation study among 173 caregivers of stroke patients six months post-stroke. Main measures: Outcome measure: Caregiver Strain Index Expanded. Reference measures: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, two questions on life satisfaction, Barthel Index and Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Additionally, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. Results: Neither the Caregiver Strain Index Expanded nor the original Caregiver Strain Index showed floor or ceiling effects. The sum score of the positive items showed a ceiling effect and was skewed to the right (2. 20). Principal component analysis revealed no clear <b>underlying</b> <b>item</b> clustering. Alpha values of the Caregiver Strain Index Expanded and the original Caregiver Strain Index were good (0. 82 and 0. 83), but the alpha value of the positive subscale of the Caregiver Strain Index Expanded was too low (0. 51). Convergent validity was confirmed for the Caregiver Strain Index Expanded, the original Caregiver Strain Index and the positive subscale. The Caregiver Strain Index Expanded and the original Caregiver Strain Index showed nearly identical correlations with the reference measures. Negative caregiving experiences were more strongly related to partners’ mood and life satisfaction than positive caregiving experiences. In the regression analyses, the positive subscale showed little added value in predicting partners’ mood and life satisfaction. Conclusion: The addition of five positively phrased items does not improve {{the psychometric properties}} of the Caregiver Strain Index...|$|R
