Some {{of these methods}} can ensure positioning accuracy but poor ability to resist pollution, some lower cost but positioning is not accurate. In this paper, we study the Gray bus location system {{can be used in}} linear or circular displacement detection. Gray bus location system has a precise location. Its ability to resist pollution is strong, waterproof. Gray bus location system detecting the unloading car’s real time location, then, let the signal of real-time location transmitted to MCU. MCU converts the signal into switch signal to control the discharging car running. Through Gray bus position detection device and control system to work together, can realize the <b>unloading</b> <b>car</b> walk smoothly, the stop position accurately...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{presents}} the results of an exploratory study to identify solutions for <b>unloading</b> <b>car</b> vehicles in retail stores in urban areas. The focus group technique was used to identify the goals and solutions by the government and logistics operators. The revealed preference research was applied to the retailers, presenting hypothetical scenarios based on the solutions indicated by the first group. The off-peak delivery, the internalization of the unloading operation and the implementation of a freight distribution center were evaluated. From the results analysis, off-peak delivery and the use of a distribution center were the most pointed options by retailers. The results indicate {{that it is possible to}} identify sustainable solutions, from the city point of view, to urban freight distribution, when all stakeholders are included in the discussion. Furthermore, the off-peak operation is an important alternative for delivery vehicles to retailers, associated with the use of a distribution center for stock maintenance...|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to limits, test procedure has certain finer points too. For instance, the mass emission test measurements done in g/km on a chassis dynamometer requires a loading of 100 kg weight in {{addition to}} <b>unloaded</b> <b>car</b> weight in Europe. In India, BS-III norms require an extra loading of 150 kg weight to achieve the desired inertia weight mainly due to road conditions here.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 1990s PKP {{operated}} only {{a single}} motorail service on overnight trains between Gdynia and Zakopane. The service never gained essential popularity and ultimately was withdrawn in 2004. Among many factors which led to closure of this service, it was criticised for being too cumbersome: while in Zakopane the passengers' cars were available almost immediately, it took nearly two hours to load or <b>unload</b> <b>cars</b> in Gdynia.|$|R
50|$|In 2016 the {{terminal}} <b>unloaded</b> 324,000 gondola <b>cars,</b> including 158,000 innovative ones and 190,000 heavy haul gondola cars (over 70 tonne). In November 2016, the transshipment complexes of Vostochny Port, set a daily performance record of <b>unloading</b> coal <b>cars</b> in the winter, 1,050 unit / day, {{which is more}} than 70,000 tonnes of coal.|$|R

50|$|The entire {{rail system}} {{consisted}} of an eight-track railroad yard, a railroad ferry terminal, and two diesel switcher locomotives. The two engines, an EMD SW1 and EMD SW9, {{made up the}} primary locomotive roster to assist in most of its switching activities and the loading of rail cars onto barges. About twice each month from the Port of Mobile, the railroad ferry service transported an average of 24 tank cars throughout each voyage, delivering and receiving both loaded and <b>unloaded</b> <b>cars</b> from the terminal {{to the rest of}} the national U.S. rail network.|$|R
5000|$|In 1895, Buffalo {{was awarded}} a contract, valued at $900,000, from New York Central Railroad to build its most {{expensive}} freight cars to date with an order for 1,500 boxcars. The cars were to feature air brakes, automatic couplers and all-steel trucks. [...] Buffalo {{was awarded a}}nother lucrative contract in 1898 to build 500 hopper cars for the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway; although the cars included drop doors to <b>unload</b> the <b>cars</b> through the floor, the cars were intended {{to be used in}} conjunction with a car dumper that would <b>unload</b> the <b>car</b> through end doors directly into the hold of a coal-fired ship.|$|R

5000|$|The {{remaining}} northern {{section of}} the High Bridge Branch is been owned by Morris County and managed {{under the auspices of}} the County's Department of Transportation (MCDOT) since 1986. It is operated under a lease agreement by the Dover & Rockaway River Railroad (D&R), effective July 1, 2017. The branch starts at Ferromonte Junction, which is a switch on the Chester Branch. Until October 2013, the only active customer on the line was Blue Ridge Lumber which <b>unloads</b> <b>cars</b> at the Kenvil Team Track off U.S. Route 46. In October 2013, Triumph Plastics began receiving carloads of plastic at their facility in Flanders, NJ which marked the first revenue freight train to operate beyond Kenvil since 2008.|$|R

50|$|Alternatives to {{the rotary}} dump cars are bottom dump cars with bottom doors, and back end hoes which <b>unload</b> gondola <b>cars.</b> The former has the {{disadvantage}} that any imperfection in the seals {{of the doors}} allows material to spill onto the track.|$|R
50|$|A rotary car dumper or wagon tippler (UK) is a {{mechanism}} used for <b>unloading</b> certain railroad <b>cars</b> such as hopper cars, gondolas or lorries (tipplers, UK). It holds the rail {{car to a}} section of track and rotates the track and car together to dump out the contents. Used with gondola cars, it is making open hopper cars obsolete. Because hopper cars require sloped chutes in order to direct the contents to the bottom dump doors (hatches) for <b>unloading,</b> gondola <b>cars</b> allow cars to be shorter, thus lowering their center of gravity, while carrying the same gross rail load.|$|R

50|$|Ever {{since the}} First World War, motor {{vehicles}} are being transported by train {{from one side}} to the other. The Autoschleuse or Tauernschleuse, known in English as Tauern Motorail consists of a specially adapted car shuttle train, with the possibility to load and <b>unload</b> many <b>cars</b> in a short amount of time. Since the safety rules were sharpened, the train also consists of several passenger carriages and passengers travel within them.|$|R
50|$|Embarkation for foot {{passengers}} {{is situated}} {{on the first floor}} of the terminal building. After the Spanish immigration checks, a network of footbridges lead to the ship. These footbridges can reach each quay and via moving 'last metres', so that one can board the ships without having to touch the ground. The loading and <b>unloading</b> of <b>cars</b> does not interfere with the embarkation or disembarkation of foot passengers.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{known as}} a [...] "bogie hearth", the car furnace is an {{extremely}} large batch furnace. The floor is constructed as an insulated movable car that is moved {{in and out of}} the furnace for loading and <b>unloading.</b> The <b>car</b> is usually sealed using sand seals or solid seals when in position. Due to the difficulty in getting a sufficient seal, car furnaces are usually used for non-atmosphere processes.|$|R
50|$|Spectators {{entered the}} theatre {{through one of}} three doors in the vestibule, which was {{equipped}} with a roof to protect <b>unloading</b> horse <b>cars.</b> The lobby measured 15.40 by 9.00 metres. Ticket counters were placed {{on either side of}} the lobby, with doors beside them that gave access to the second storey balconies. Doors directly across from the entrance led to the stalls and the first level of balconies.|$|R
40|$|Robots are {{increasingly}} {{used by the}} industries especially, in the loading and unloading operations. This research concentrates on the loading and <b>unloading</b> operations of <b>car</b> wheels using an industrial robot arm. The concept operation of the industrial robot arm is discussed thoroughly. This research showed {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of using robot arm to handle loading and <b>unloading</b> operation for <b>car</b> wheels. In manufacturing operations, the geometry and the weight of a car wheels makes it difficult to be handle using manual labor. This research uplifts the potential advantages of using robot arm in dealing with these problems. This in-turn can increase the productivity of the car wheels manufacturing industries...|$|R
5000|$|The Cape Charles Harbor serves local {{industry}} and commerce operations {{as well as}} tourists andrecreational users. The harbor was originally developed to load and <b>unload</b> railroad <b>cars</b> on barges. The harbor includes extensive bulkheading, as well as commercial docking facilities for industrial uses. The Industrial land use in the Town is concentrated at the Cape Charles Harbor area, and includes theEastern Shore Railroad, Bayshore Concrete, the commercial dock and the Sustainable Technology Park.|$|R
5000|$|The typical {{construction}} of an ore dock is a long high structure, with a railway track or tracks along the top {{with a number of}} [...] "pockets" [...] into which ore is <b>unloaded</b> from <b>cars,</b> typically by gravity. Each pocket has a chute that can be lowered to discharge the ore into the hold of a ship berthed alongside. The use of pockets and chutes allows loading the dock asynchronously of its discharge into the freighter.|$|R
50|$|Routine {{operations}} involved two trains moving ten {{or twelve}} loaded pulpwood cars south from Eagle Lake to Umbazooksus Lake, and empty pulpwood cars northward in a round trip taking about 3 hours. The two trains would pass at a midpoint siding. One Plymouth switcher shunted loading cars at Eagle Lake and the other shunted <b>unloading</b> <b>cars</b> at Umbazooksus Lake. The inland rail of the 600-foot (180 m) long pulpwood unloading pier was six inches (15 cm) higher than the lakeside rail to expedite unloading. The floor of each pulpwood car sloped 12 inches (30 cm) to the unloading side; and the slatted {{side of the car}} was hinged at the top to swing open when latches were released so the pulpwood would slide out of the car into Umbazooksus Lake. Bark breaking off the pulpwood logs accumulated so the Plymouth switcher periodically dragged a rake adjacent to the pier to keep the water deep enough to float the pulpwood logs being dumped. Normal operations transferred 6,500 cords of pulpwood per week enabling Great Northern Paper Company to manufacture approximately one fifth of the United States' annual paper production.|$|R
50|$|The pier's three decks {{were used}} for the loading and <b>unloading</b> of <b>cars,</b> taxis, and trucks, which {{alleviated}} congestion on local streets. The ground floor was dedicated to cargo operations, with the central courtyard utilized for the parking and loading of up to 350 trucks simultaneously. The second floor was used for passenger operations, serving taxis picking up arriving passengers, and featuring a furnished waiting room. The roof served as parking for over 700 cars. Ramps connected the three levels.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to loading and <b>unloading</b> the <b>cars,</b> {{each of the}} stations performs a substantially different function. The Fantasy Forest station is the [...] "Drive" [...] station, its bullwheel is driven by a large electric motor, with a backup diesel engine used to unload the ride {{in case of a}} power outage. The diesel engines were replaced by Volkswagen Beetle motors in 2007. The cars are stored on sidetracks {{off to the side of}} this station when not being used.|$|R
50|$|From 18 June 1965 {{the station}} became the {{terminus}} of a seasonal motorail service from London, the end loading dock behind the former main (Up side) platform {{being used for}} <b>unloading</b> the <b>cars.</b> Early photographs show the station building to be shorter than it is today, with the extension carried out along with refurbishment for motorail traffic. Motorail kept the station in use each summer season until the regular service ended on 19 September 1980 and the occasional peak service on 16 September 1982.|$|R
50|$|Little Junior Brown is an {{asthmatic}} psychopath. Enraged {{that they}} are so behind schedule, he insists that Ronnie move the four trucks full of stolen cars in a caravan, instead of staggering them to avoid detection. The caravan draws {{the attention of the}} police, and when they arrive at the Brooklyn Navy Yard to <b>unload</b> the <b>cars,</b> the police arrive. During the arrests, Jimmy's passenger shoots at the police. The bullet goes through Jimmy's hand and just below the right eye of Detective Calvin Hart.|$|R
5000|$|The {{southern}} {{portion of}} the park is a former dock facility and includes restored [...] "contained apron" [...] transfer bridges of the James B. French patent. These were built in 1925 to load and <b>unload</b> rail <b>car</b> floats that served industries on Long Island via the Long Island Rail Road tracks that used to run along 48th Avenue (now part of Hunter's Point Park). The northern portion of Gantry Plaza State Park {{was part of a}} former Pepsi bottling plant that closed in 1999.|$|R
