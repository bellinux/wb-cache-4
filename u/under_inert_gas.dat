5|$|Protactinium oxides are basic; they easily {{convert to}} {{hydroxides}} and can form various salts, such as sulfates, phosphates, nitrates, etc. The nitrate is usually white {{but can be}} brown due to radiolytic decomposition. Heating the nitrate in air at 400°C converts it to the white protactinium pentoxide. The polytrioxophosphate Pa(PO3)4 can be produced by reacting difluoride sulfate PaF2SO4 with phosphoric acid (H3PO4) <b>under</b> <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> atmosphere. Heating the product to about 900°C eliminates the reaction by-products such as hydrofluoric acid, sulfur trioxide and phosphoric anhydride. Heating to higher temperatures in an inert atmosphere decomposes Pa(PO3)4 into the diphosphate PaP2O7, which is analogous to diphosphates of other actinides. In the diphosphate, the PO3 groups form pyramids of C2v symmetry. Heating PaP2O7 in air to 1400°C decomposes it into the pentoxides of phosphorus and protactinium.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} <b>inert</b> <b>gases,</b> {{nitrogen}} and carbon dioxide, on the oxidative degradation of low-density polyethylene appearing as colored spots {{has been studied}} during an extrusion process in competition with an antioxidant. Extrusion <b>under</b> <b>inert</b> <b>gases</b> significantly decreases the degradation level in the critical region of the process in comparison with classical extrusion under air. The effect of antioxidants on degradation during extrusion at a high temperature is weak. The main processes acting on this reduction of polymer oxidation and {{the origin of the}} color of degraded domains have been investigated. Energy-dispersive spectra of particles have confirmed that degradation is caused by thermooxidation. The nature of chromophore groups in degraded areas has been identified by IR microscopy.

Substituted phthalocyanine complexes often have much higher solubility. They are less thermally stable and often can not be sublimed.
