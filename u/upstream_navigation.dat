50|$|The swing span is {{no longer}} used, and the narrow deck of the bridge is now viewed as substandard. The new Miramichi Bridge {{completed}} in 1995 provides a wider, safer crossing only 1 km upstream. It has created a newer, permanent obstacle to <b>upstream</b> <b>navigation.</b>|$|E
50|$|As far as {{the pier}} of this port the creek is at all times navigable. Steamers up to 200 tons can {{approach}} this port. Dharamtar <b>upstream</b> <b>navigation</b> is difficult. At ordinary high tides, boats of 15 tons, and at spring tides boats of 25 tons can go to Nagothana, 14 mi east.Steamer services ply daily between Mumbai and Dharamtar.|$|E
50|$|In 1963, {{two of the}} girder spans and a pier were removed, and a Petit truss span {{was added}} in its place. This was done to allow <b>upstream</b> <b>navigation</b> past St. Anthony Falls for barges. The Petit truss design is unusual for the Mississippi River {{and is one of}} three on the island (Boom Island and Nicollet Island Inn bridges are Petit truss spans, too).|$|E

50|$|It {{was built}} in 1884 by the Northern Pacific Railway. The bridge was {{originally}} built in 1884 with five through-trusses. In 1927, it was renovated with nine plate-girder spans. In 1963, to provide <b>upstream</b> river <b>navigation,</b> two girder spans and three regular piers were removed {{to make room for}} a Warren truss span over the main channel, set on two heavier piers. This work took almost two years.|$|R
5000|$|In January 1854, the New South Wales Government proclaimed two new districts: Port Curtis and Leichhardt (roughly today's Fitzroy Region), and {{settlement}} {{began in earnest}} in 1855. The Fitzroy River provided a convenient waterway for shipping of supplies for those who followed them, and a settlement grew on the riverbanks just downstream of a bar of rocks which prevented further <b>upstream</b> <b>navigation</b> from the coast. These rocks were incorporated with the traditional English term for a village, and the name [...] "Rockhampton" [...] was first used.|$|E
5000|$|The Whitewater River is a 101 mi southerly flowing right {{tributary}} of the Great Miami River in southeastern Indiana and southwestern Ohio in the United States. It is formed by the confluence of two forks, the West Fork and East Fork. The name is a misnomer, {{as there is no}} true white water on the river. However, there are many rapids due to the steep gradient present - the river falls an average of [...] The gradient rendered <b>upstream</b> <b>navigation</b> impossible, and in the mid-nineteenth century resulted {{in the construction of the}} Whitewater Canal paralleling the river from north of Connersville, Indiana, to the Ohio River.|$|E
50|$|Beside {{the lock}} to the {{southern}} side is Osney pool beside which is an Environment Agency base for maintaining the river. The weir is <b>upstream</b> alongside the <b>navigation</b> channel in two parts and feeds the Osney pool.|$|R
5000|$|Riverside {{was first}} {{settled in the}} 1880s by Uriah Ward. When steamboats began {{traveling}} up the Okanogan River, Riverside was the <b>upstream</b> limit of <b>navigation</b> during the high water season. [...] Riverside was officially incorporated on December 22, 1913.|$|R
50|$|Historically Piranhas was the <b>{{upstream}}</b> {{limit of}} <b>navigation</b> {{on the lower}} São Francisco River. Immediately upstream of Piranhas there were impassable rapids, and 60 km further upstream was the major falls at Paulo Afonso. Above those falls the São Francisco became navigable again for over 1500 km.|$|R
25|$|The river depth was {{progressively}} {{increased and}} narrow points widened to allow larger vessels {{into the river}} and further <b>upstream.</b> For <b>navigation</b> and safety reasons the Seventeen Mile Rocks were completely removed in 1965 after numerous partially successful attempts in the past. The northern river bank {{at the mouth of}} the river has undergone reclamation projects over the years, especially in the suburbs of Hamilton and Pinkenba. More recently, extensive port facilities have been constructed on Fisherman's Island which has also seen significant land reclamation into the bay.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} roads around Arkhangelsk. The Northern Dvina is navigable, {{and there is}} regular {{passenger}} <b>navigation</b> <b>upstream</b> from Arkhangelsk. There is also regular, albeit infrequent, sea passenger navigation connecting Arkhangelsk with the settlements on the Onega Peninsula (including Pertominsk, Lopshenga, and Letnyaya Zolotitsa) which are not connected to the all-season road network. Arkhangelsk also has air connections with these settlements, {{as well as with}} Solovetsky Islands.|$|R
500|$|Cheswold Hauling Bridge, {{also known}} as Cheswold High Bridge, is a {{footbridge}} on the navigation towpath, which crosses {{the second of the}} two weir streams where the river leaves the <b>navigation</b> <b>upstream</b> of Doncaster Town Lock. [...] The small section of river between the footbridge and where it rejoins that part of the River Don that left the navigation at Newtons Farm footbridge is called the River Cheswold, reputedly the shortest river in Great Britain.|$|R
50|$|Eighty {{per cent}} of the {{district}} lies within the River Thames catchment area, with the Thames itself and several tributaries including the River Windrush and River Leach running through the district. Lechlade in an important point on the river as the <b>upstream</b> limit of <b>navigation.</b> In the 2007 floods in the UK, rivers were the source of flooding of 53 per {{cent of the}} locations affected and the Thames at Lechlade reached record levels with over 100 reports of flooding.|$|R
5000|$|From 1984 until 2010 Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT) {{operated}} two passenger-only boats, appropriately {{named the}} [...] and Yoker Swan. In 2007, a study was {{started to see}} the feasibility of replacing the ferry with a bridge, which would allow 24-hour crossings. It would be necessary for the bridge to have a large clearance or be able to open, due to shipbuilding and other river <b>navigation</b> <b>upstream</b> on the River Clyde. The study found that a replacement bridge would cost around fifteen million pounds.|$|R
50|$|The bridge {{remained}} operational, principally for {{coal and}} lumber barges, until 1940 when {{replacement of the}} downstream bridge at Anderson Street, Hackensack, with a fixed span, closed the river <b>upstream</b> to <b>navigation.</b> A new roadway for extending Hackensack Avenue beyond its intersection with Main Street in River Edge, to an extension of New Bridge Road in New Milford was laid out in 1956 across {{the northwest corner of}} the Bergen County Historical Society's property, to a new concrete-and-steel bridge over the Hackensack River, 500' north of the iron truss bridge. Thus, the Bergen County Historical Society prevented construction of an elevated highway bridge immediately adjacent to the south gable-end of the historic Steuben House. The closing of the 1889 swing bridge to automotive traffic turned Main Street, River Edge, into a dead-end in front of the Steuben House. Old New Bridge Road (on the boundary between New Milford and Teaneck) likewise became a dead end.|$|R
40|$|In 2003 an {{accessibility}} study {{based on}} real-time simulations for the S-class container ships of Maersk Sealand was performed at Flanders Hydraulics Research {{in cooperation with}} all involved parties (public and port authorities, pilots, tug and shipping company). The regulation for the <b>upstream</b> and downstream <b>navigation</b> on the Western Scheldt did not accept {{the arrival of a}} ship with length over all greater than 340 m. The paper describes two main research studies executed to fill in the gap of knowledge about the manoeuvring behaviour of container ships in shallow and confined water: the accessibility of Ultra Large Container Ships with a maximum capacity of 14, 000 TEU to the Western Scheldt and the accessibility of the Berendrecht Lock and Delwaide Dock located on the right bank of the port of Antwerp. An integrated simulation platform with mathematical models describing hydrodynamic (manoeuvrability, ship-bank and ship-ship interaction) and external (wind, current, tug assistance) forces and coupled ship manoeuvring simulators helped in evaluating the possibilities and limitations of head-on encounters, lock and turning manoeuvres. The combination of research and training has finally led to the arrival of the MSC Beatrice in April 2009. After a validation period of more than half a year, characterised by a constant adaptation of negotiated restrictions, a new regulation for the <b>upstream</b> and downstream <b>navigation</b> is being prepared...|$|R
50|$|The {{financial}} crisis of 1866 {{put an end}} to the 1864 Tay Bridge proposal, but it was revived in 1869. Matthew responded with a series of letters to the Dundee papers arguing for a Newburgh bridge, and advancing all manner of additional arguments against a Dundee bridge; it would have a deleterious effect on silting and tidal scour in the Firth; it would prevent <b>navigation</b> <b>upstream</b> of it; it would be torn apart by the centrifugal force from heavy trains rapidly descending the curve at its northern end; it was vulnerable to earthquake, a ship colliding with a pier, or to high wind.|$|R
50|$|Kouroussa or Kurussa {{is a town}} {{located in}} northeastern Guinea, and is the capital of Kouroussa Prefecture. As of 2014 it had a {{population}} of 39,611 people. A trade center and river port from at least {{the time of the}} Mali Empire, Kouroussa has long relied upon its position near the <b>upstream</b> limit of <b>navigation</b> of the Niger River to make it an important crossroads for people and goods moving between the Guinea coast and the states of the western Soudan and Niger River valley. The town and surrounding area is a center of Malinke culture, and is known for its Djembe drumming tradition.|$|R
25|$|There {{have been}} {{proposals}} {{to extend the}} <b>navigation</b> <b>upstream</b> from Alveston to a link with the Grand Union Canal at either Warwick or Leamington Spa. This was first considered by the Severn Trent Water Authority in 1974, who conducted a survey, the cost of which was partly funded by the Inland Waterways Association. This would open up a stretch of river that has never previously been navigable, but the proposal has not been universally welcomed. Landowners at Warwick Castle and Charlecote Park have attempted to claim the river as private property, although the 1636 Orders of Council state that the river was free to Coventry. Despite much local support, {{there is still some}} opposition to the scheme.|$|R
5000|$|In 1828 Haverton Hill {{was a small}} hamlet. The {{settlement}} {{along with}} adjoining, Port Clarence, grew {{as a result of}} the Clarence Railway opening in 1833. The railway, owned by Christopher Tennant, was a rival to the Stockton and Darlington Railway and transported coal from the Durham coalfields to colliers for shipment to places like London. Haverton Hill and Port Clarence was chosen as termini as the river at that stretch was deep enough to accommodate ships. Further <b>upstream</b> near Stockton-on-Tees, <b>navigation</b> was extremely difficult due to shallow waters. Directly opposite, on the other side of the River Tees, the Stockton and Darlington Railway was, for the same reason, extended, in 1830, to Middlesbrough [...]|$|R
5000|$|With its {{position}} near the <b>upstream</b> limit of <b>navigation</b> on the Niger River, Kouroussa {{is an important}} center of transport and trade. The Guinea Railway crosses the Niger River at this town, where {{there is also a}} river port. [...] The town also lies at a junction in Guinea's N1 highway, which is a major transport route between Conakry, Kankan, and (via the N7 and N32) neighboring Mali. [...] The metre gauge Niger - Conakry rail line runs 588 km to the capital of Guinea, with a branch of 74 kilometers running from Kouroussa to Kankan. It was built by the French, using African labor, in the first two decades of the 20th century.|$|R
5000|$|Located about {{midway between}} Chattanooga and Knoxville, the lake begins as the Tennessee River below Fort Loudon Dam (...) in Lenoir City, Tennessee and {{stretches}} 72.4 miles (116.5 km) to Watts Bar Dam (...) , near Spring City, Tennessee. The Clinch River {{connects to the}} main channel of the lake at mile 568 (...) near Southwest Point (site of Andrew Jackson and John Sevier's 1803 confrontation) in Kingston, Tennessee. The widening of the Clinch by the lake makes that river navigable {{all the way up}} to Melton Hill Dam (...) , which is equipped with a navigation lock allowing <b>navigation</b> <b>upstream</b> through Oak Ridge and Clinton. The partially navigable Emory River connects with the Clinch near the TVA's Kingston Steam Plant just upriver from the meeting with the Tennessee. Including the Clinch and Emory arms, Watts Bar has 722 mi of shoreline and over 39,000 acres (160 km²) of water surface. Minor tributaries include Poplar Creek, Caney Creek, and White's Creek. The lake contains several large islands, most notably Thief Neck Island, Long Island, and Sand Island.|$|R
500|$|The next Act {{to affect}} the river was {{obtained}} {{by a group of}} local men in 1785. Under the Act, the proprietors were empowered to make the river navigable for 30-ton barges up to Newbridge. They had no jurisdiction over the river from Arundel to Houghton bridge, and could not charge tolls for use of the river up to Pallingham. There were 31 members of the proprietors, who could raise £10,000 by issuing 100 shares worth £100 each. Day-to-day oversight of the affairs of the navigation were managed by three proprietors, with a half-yearly meeting of the larger group. The purpose of the navigation was to carry coal, chalk and lime upstream, and agricultural produce in the other direction. Rather than improve the river channel, the <b>navigation</b> <b>upstream</b> of Pallingham consisted of a separate channel, containing three locks, and an aqueduct which carried the navigation over the river at Orfold. The journey below Pallingham was made [...] shorter by cutting a new channel between Coldwaltham and Hardham. This involved the construction of three more locks and a [...] tunnel. The Pallingham to Newbridge section opened on 1 August 1787, while the Hardham cut was completed in mid-1790. The cost of the work was around £16,000.|$|R
5|$|One {{improvement}} {{that was}} completed was {{the construction of}} the New Junction Canal. This had been authorised by an Act of Parliament obtained on 28 July 1891 by the Aire and Calder Navigation, which specified that the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Company would share the cost of construction and the ownership of the new waterway. No work could start until the company actually owned their canals, and they were required to raise £150,000 {{at a time when they}} had just failed to raise the finance for the takeover of the original canals. However, three-quarters of the cost had been raised by 1903. The new canal leaves the original navigation at Bramwith Junction, runs over the River Don on an aqueduct, and continues in a straight line for , to join the Aire and Calder <b>Navigation</b> <b>upstream</b> from Goole. It provided a much more direct route from Sheffield to Goole, and was opened on 2 January 1905. The company had hoped to run compartment boats for the transport of coal along the canal, as the Aire and Calder did, but although straightening of the navigation was completed at Doncaster in April 1905 and at Sprotborough in late 1907, and Doncaster Town Lock was lengthened in 1909 and 1910, most of the locks could only hold three compartments at a time, and so there was little advantage to using this type of boat.|$|R
5000|$|The Diama Dam, {{sometimes}} referred to as the Maka-Diama Dam, is a gravity dam on the Senegal River, spanning the border of Senegal and Mauritania. It is located next to the town of Diama, Senegal and about 22 km north of Saint-Louis, Senegal. The purpose of the dam is to prevent saltwater intrusion upstream, supply water for the irrigation of about 45000 ha of crops and create a road crossing for the road between St. Louis and Nouakchott in Mauritania. Additionally, a ship lock built within the dam provides for <b>navigation</b> <b>upstream.</b> Plans for the dam were first drawn in 1970 when the riparian states within the Senegal River Basin Development Authority agreed to develop the Senegal River. The Diama Dam was to be constructed in conjunction with the Manantali Dam which was to be located further upstream in Mali. Construction on the Diama Dam began on 15 September 1981 and was completed on 12 August 1986. The Manantali Dam was completed in 1988. The Diama project was funded by a US$149.5 million loan from the African Development Bank. The main section of the dam with ship lock and spillway is 170 m long while a 440 m long embankment dam section extends north {{to the edge of the}} river.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{a wide range}} of water resource problems and opportunities related to the Missouri River and the six main stem dams along an area extending over 1. 500 miles from Sioux City. Iowa to Three Forks. Montana. Subjects of the study were: the feasibility of installing additional hydro-power generating units both at the main stem dams and adjacent to the river; resolution of bank erosion, waterlogging, and residual flood problems; opportunities for recreation, fish and wildlife enhancement; operating plans of the main stem system considering future water use; and potential for extending <b>navigation</b> <b>upstream</b> from Sioux City. Iowa. Several elements were dropped {{during the course of the}} study. Water allocation and marketing was an initial objective; however, basin states indicated such studies to be untimely. This report, therefore, does not make any recommendations dealing with priorities of water use. Surface inundation and waterlogging along a 10 -mile reach upstream from the mouth of the Niobrara River during periods of high release from Fort Randall have been judicially determined to require Federal compensation of the landowners. A separate report will deal with this problem. In response to the waterlogging problem at Suford-Trenton, North Dakota, the Corps has developed adrainage plan to be accomplished under existing authority. Extension of navigation past the main stem dams or only as far as Yankton, South Dakota, is clearly infeasible even under the most favorable aasumptions. Potential hydro-power additions at the Oahe and Fort Randall damsites and a pumped-storage facility at Garrison have been deferred for future evaluation...|$|R
