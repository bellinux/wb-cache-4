50|$|The 60 pounder {{remained}} unchanged except for carriage modifications to enable mechanisation and new sights. Carriages were first the Mk IVR carriage that had wooden wheels and solid rubber tyres {{and later the}} Mk IVP carriage had metal wheels, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres</b> and appropriate brakes. South Africa developed a new carriage of their own design from the Mk 1, this <b>used</b> <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyred</b> wheels on a two-wheel bogie.|$|R
40|$|Good tyre {{models are}} {{essential}} for driving simulation of all ground vehicles <b>using</b> <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres.</b> However, tyre behaviour is extremely complex, often requiring different models for the various behaviours. This paper presents an implemented tyre model library that {{takes advantage of the}} modular modelling possibilities in Modelica to combine different models. For example, the different sub models representing tyre-to-road contact can be combined with various models for tyre belt behaviour. The library can be used together with vehicle models in one, two and three dimensions. ...|$|R
5000|$|Wheels were of cast iron, {{sometimes}} wooden artillery or cart wheels {{for early}} examples. Fowler, builders of ploughing engines, built riveted steel-spoked wheels, {{as for the}} engines themselves. Their large vans differed distinctively from other makers in numerous details: side doors rather than rear, horizontal panelling and also common use of a clerestory window above. Later vans, from around 1900, carried solid rubber tyres. Modern examples have sometimes been refitted with <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres.</b> Living vans for steam roller gangs on road construction began <b>using</b> <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres</b> in the 1930s, to avoid damage to newly-laid asphalt.|$|R
50|$|Presta and Schrader valves <b>used</b> on <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres</b> are {{examples}} of poppet valves. The Presta valve has no spring and relies on a pressure differential for opening and closing while being inflated.|$|R
50|$|Although {{originally}} {{design as}} a double-deck vehicle, a single deck version entered service in 1925. The initial batch of 24 (K1078 - K1101) entered service in August 1925 with 24-seat bodies on new chassis. These {{were the first}} vehicles to <b>use</b> <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres</b> in London. Subsequent batches of single-deck K-types used new bodies on the chassis of older double-deck vehicles from which the body had been removed. Conversely, future orders of the new single-deck chassis received double-deck bodywork.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of automotive technology {{has given rise}} to a new class of monorail which owes little to the work of Palmer and Lartigue. These vehicles are suspended from or straddle concrete beams, and <b>use</b> <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres</b> to improve adhesion and reduce noise compared with wheel on steel. They {{have more in common with}} guided buses than conventional railways. The beam is less obtrusive than an overhead roadway or railway, and the modern designs may have a niche in dealing with right of way problems in congested city centres, at lower cost compared with tunneling.|$|R
25|$|During 1924 {{nearly half}} the fleet were {{converted}} to <b>use</b> <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres</b> (Dunlop & Michelin) instead of the earlier solid rubber or later Supercushion designs; by 1925 the Corporation had already determined based on both direct (price, life) and indirect (vibration damage, fuel consumption) cost comparisons, {{as well as the}} increased passenger comfort, to use them on the entire fleet. The issue of vibration was particularly serious in Edinburgh to the prevalence of granite paved streets. Conversion presented difficulty on the rear twin tyres on the AEC Model 507 double-deckers due to the maximum legal width (7' 6), but this was overcome with in-house modifications.|$|R
5000|$|Fire Engine: Morris Fire Engine {{was built}} by the famous fire {{engineers}} M/s. John Morris and Sons Ltd of Salford, Lancashire in 1914. Only two Morris-Belsize fire-engine are known to exist in world today. Apart from the one with National Rail Museum, New Delhi, a 1912 model is preserved by the Enfield and District Veteran Vehicle. The fire engine preserved at the Enfield and District Veteran Vehicle, Whitewebbs Museum of Transport, Clay Hill, London, has been converted to <b>use</b> <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres</b> by Dennis Bros. Thus, the fire engine at National Rail Museum {{is the only one}} left in the world running on solid rubber tyres.|$|R
40|$|Viscoelastic Machine Elements, which {{encompass}} elastomeric elements (rubber-like components), fluidic elements (lubricating squeeze films) {{and their}} combinations, {{are used for}} absorbing vibration, reducing friction and improving energy <b>use.</b> Examplesinclude <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres,</b> oil and lip seals, compliant bearings and races, and thin films.

50|$|The {{first true}} cars made in Australia were steam cars. The {{first of these}} steam cars, the Phaeton, was made in 1896 by Herbert Thomson and Edward Holmes of Armadale, Melbourne. It was {{exhibited}} in 1900 <b>using</b> the first <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres</b> made in Australia by Dunlop. The 5 horsepower single cylinder steam carriage which {{is now in the}} Institute of Applied Sciences, Melbourne, was reliable and durable enough to take Thomson and a friend 493 miles from Bathurst to Melbourne at an average speed of 8.7 mp/h.|$|R
50|$|After the 1962 {{closure of}} the {{southern}} portion of the line, a Mr. Charles Ashby purchased Droxford station {{and the right to}} run trains over the railway. He used it for testing a design of railbus that he had developed called the Sadler Rail Coach or 'Pacerailer'. Like the similarly named British Rail 'Pacer' of later years, this was essentially a bus-style vehicle. Unlike the later BR types, the Sadler Rail Coach <b>used</b> road-vehicle style <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres</b> on its drive wheels and flanged steel wheels at each end to guide it along the track. As well as the MVR itself, a special steep-gradient section of track was built for testing at Droxford. A company called Sadler Vectrail Ltd was established in 1966 to re-open the Ryde to Cowes railway on the Isle of Wight using Sadler Rail Coaches and the prototype vehicle appeared briefly at an Island Industries Fair but the scheme was unsuccessful.|$|R
50|$|John Boyd Dunlop {{developed}} the first practical <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyre</b> in 1887 in South Belfast. Willie Hume demonstrated {{the supremacy of}} Dunlop's newly invented <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres</b> in 1889, winning the tyre's first ever races in Ireland and then England.

25|$|J B Dunlop {{resigned}} in 1895, and sold {{most of his}} interest in <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre.</b> In 1896 Harvey Du Cros persuaded his board to sell <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> to financier Ernest Terah Hooley for £3million. Hooley drummed up support by offering financial journalists cheap shares and appointing aristocrats to the board, and quickly sold the business again {{this time as the}} Dunlop <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> Company for £5million providing a gross profit to Hooley's syndicate including du Cros of £1.7million.|$|R
50|$|John Boyd Dunlop (5 February 1840 - 23 October 1921) was a Scottish-born {{and educated}} {{inventor}} and veterinary surgeon who {{spent most of}} his career in Ireland.

He sold his rights to the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres</b> to a company he formed {{with the president of the}} Irish Cyclists' Association, Harvey Du Cros, for a small cash sum and a small shareholding in their <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyre</b> business. Dunlop withdrew in 1896. The company that bore his name, Dunlop <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> Company, was not incorporated until later using the name well known to the public, but it was Du Cros's creation.|$|R

50|$|Pacific Dunlop has {{its roots}} in the Irish Dunlop <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> Company, which {{established}} the Dunlop <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> Company of Australasia in 1893, which included a local finishing factory and office in Melbourne to supply the market with bicycle tyres. In 1899 downturn in cycling's popularity and speculation from the parent company led to the sell-off of Dunlop's Australasian and North American operations, and the Dunlop <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> Company of Australasia was floated with 80,000 shares, costing £1 per share. The company was listed on Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide stock exchanges.|$|R
