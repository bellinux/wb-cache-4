So it was like {{painting}} by numbers... used to love me and Percy; we'd go in and run through our dictionary licks and he'd record them and make a loop of them. Robert Fripp, who worked with Eno on (No Pussyfooting) and Here Come the Warm Jets, performed the solo on [...] "St. Elmo's Fire". Eno asked Fripp to improvise a lightning-fast guitar solo that would imitate an electrical charge between two poles on a Wimshurst high voltage generator. This {{was the basis for}} Eno crediting Fripp's solo on this track as [...] "Wimshurst Guitar".|$|E
500|$|After {{less than}} five years as a judge, Denning was {{appointed}} a Lord Justice of Appeal on 14 October 1948. He was sworn in as a Privy Counsellor on 25 October 1948. As a Lord Justice of Appeal he continued to make reforming judgments in a variety of areas, particularly in family law and the rights of deserted wives. In 1952 the Court of Appeal heard Bendall v McWhirter [...] 2 QB 466 and ruled that a deserted wife occupying the marital home had a personal licence to stay there. The decision provoked disapproval among the judiciary and from the public; a correspondent wrote: Dear Sir: You are a disgrace to all mankind to let these women break up homes and expect us chaps to keep them while they rob us of what we have worked for and put us out on the street. I only hope you have the same trouble as us. So do <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>a</b> favour and take a Rolls and run off Beachy Head and don't come back.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Time named Stankonia {{as one of}} the 100 best albums of all time. [...] Rolling Stone {{ranked the}} album number 16 on the magazine's list of the 100 Best Albums of the 2000s. In 2009, Pitchfork Media ranked Stankonia number 13 on its list of the top 200 albums of the 2000s, and Rhapsody ranked it at number 2 on its [...] "100 Best Albums of the Decade" [...] list. Rhapsody also ranked the album number 6 on its [...] "Hip-Hop's Best Albums of the Decade" [...] list. [...] Vibe ranked the record at number 23 on its list of the [...] "100 Greatest Albums from 1985 to 2005". Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade [...] "best-of" [...] list, saying, [...] "With hummable hits ('Ms. Jackson') and out-there {{experiments}} ('B.O.B.'), the rap duo gave <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>a</b> visa to the funky if fictional land of Stankonia in 2000." [...] Q listed Stankonia {{as one of the}} best 50 albums of 2001. [...] The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.|$|E

500|$|Levels were {{designed}} {{based on a}} Deluxe Paint interface, which allowed several of the members to design levels, resulting in [...] "hundreds of levels". There were several internal iterations of the levels, each designer challenging the others. Dailly pointed out that David Jones [...] "used to try and beat us, and after proudly stabbing a finger at the screen and saying 'There! Beat that!', we'd calmly point out a totally new way of getting around all his traps, and {{doing it in a}} much simpler method. 'Oh...', he'd mutter, and scramble off to try and fix it." [...] They also sent internally tested levels to Psygnosis, getting back the results of their testing via fax. While most were solved quickly, Dailly commented that [...] "Every now and again though, the fax would be covered in scribbles with the time and comments crossed out again and again; this is what we were striving for while we were designing the levels, and it gave <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>a</b> warm fuzzy feeling inside." ...|$|E
500|$|Ernest's {{support of}} the Prussians in the Austro-Prussian War and later Franco Prussian War meant {{he was no longer}} the {{potential}} leader of a political movement; although it was true that {{he had been able to}} retain his duchies, it had come at a price. According to historian Charlotte Zeepvat, Ernest [...] "was increasingly lost in a whirl of private amusements which earned only contempt from outside". Ernest funneled his political thoughts into the private sphere, preferring to write covertly sponsored articles in the Coburg press that became increasingly embittered against England. In 1886, Ernest published Co-Regents and Foreign Influence in Germany, a pamphlet that greatly angered his family; though produced anonymously, no one doubted that it was written by Ernest. It attacked Vicky as a disloyal German that was too dependent on her mother, and declared that she had been too indiscreet in passing along confidential information during both war and peacetime. Queen Victoria was furious, writing to Vicky, [...] "What you told me of Uncle E and that pamphlet is simply monstrous. I assure you that I felt great difficulty in writing to him for his birthday, but I wrote it as short and cool as I could consistently with civility". [...] "Dear Uncle Ernest does <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>a</b> great deal of harm by his odd ways and uncontrollable tongue with his very lively imagination".|$|E

60|$|We call ours a {{utilitarian}} age, {{and we do}} {{not know}} the uses of any single thing. We have forgotten that water can cleanse, and fire purify, and that the Earth is mother to <b>us</b> <b>all.</b> <b>As</b> a consequence our art is of the moon and plays with shadows, while Greek art is of the sun and deals directly with things. I feel sure that in elemental forces there is purification, and I {{want to go back to}} them and live in their presence.|$|R

2500|$|In 2011 Cockburn {{wrote in}} favour of a {{substantial}} increase in the minimum wage, continued his opposition to anti-immigrant hysteria, envisioning a high-wage economic model as the alternative. While at the same time Cockburn writes sympathetically of proposals by Ron Unz to institute a tax-free cash payment of $5,000 to $10,000 to immigrants looking to return to their country of birth. He writes [...] "Unz does <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>a</b> favor by raising important [...] questions [...] {{about the role of the}} reserve army of the unemployed or of migrants in sustaining the current low-wage capitalist economy. He poses an escape from the low-wage vortex, which is also all to the good." ...|$|E

2500|$|In February 2011, Architects {{announced}} {{the departure of}} bassist Alex Dean, due to family commitments. On 3 July 2011 {{it was announced that}} Dean had rejoined the band. When Dean commented on the short 5-month split from the band he said [...] "I'm very happy {{to be able to say}} that I'm back, being able to stay at home for the past few months have given my family and I the opportunity to adjust to what happened last year and I know it's done <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>a</b> lot of good." [...] During this period where Dean was not a part of the band Casey Lagos filled in as a bass guitarist on some of the tours.|$|E
2500|$|Griffin {{informed}} BNP {{members that}} rather than [...] "bang on" [...] about the Jews—which would be deemed extremist and prove electorally unpopular—their party should focus on criticising Islam, an issue {{that would be more}} resonant among the British public. After Griffin took over, the party increasingly embraced an Islamophobic stance, launching a [...] "Campaign Against Islam" [...] in September 2001. In Islam: A Threat to <b>Us</b> <b>All,</b> <b>a</b> leaflet distributed to London households in 2007, the BNP claimed that it would stand up to both Islamic extremism and [...] "the threat that 'mainstream' Islam poses to our British culture". In contrast to the mainstream British view that the actions of militant Islamists—such as those who perpetrated the 7 July 2005 London bombings—are not representative of mainstream Islam, the BNP insists that they are. In some of its literature it presents the view that every Muslim in Britain is a threat to the country. Griffin referred to Islam as an [...] "evil, wicked faith", and elsewhere publicly described it as a [...] "cancer" [...] that needed to be removed from Europe through [...] "chemotherapy".|$|E
