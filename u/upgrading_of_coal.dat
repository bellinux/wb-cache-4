An improved communications system would allow real time risk assessment to be carried out at the mine, and the requirements for monitoring, assessment and decision making have been investigated for some common hazards.

It is important, therefore, on the basis of predicting catalyst activity, selectivity, and optimizing reactor performance, that the diffusivities of these oil species be accurately known. Contrary to laboratory reactors, where most of the studies of asphaltene`s chemical structure have taken place, most industrial reactors are continuous systems. The state of the asphaltene molecule therefore does not only depend on the temperature, pressure and polarity of the solvent but also on the reactor`s residence time. It is, therefore, very important to have a correct concept of the asphaltene`s structure and through careful experimentation, one can then decide whether such a concept has any practical implications at realistic upgrading conditions. It is the purpose of the project described here to provide such a correct concept of coal asphaltenes by careful and detailed investigations of asphaltenes transport through porous systems under realistic process temperature and pressure conditions. The experimental studies will be coupled with detailed, in-depth statistical and molecular dynamics models intended to provide a fundamental understanding of the overall transport mechanisms. 60 refs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Coal is an {{important}} fossil fuel and {{as a source of}} energy for South Africa and globally. Fine coal has been since an unattractive product because of problems associated but not limited to handling and transportation. With the depreciation <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> quality, better coal products are reserved for the export market leaving the poor quality coal products for domestic electricity generation. Based on the latter, this has resulted in interest and advancement in the coal processing techniques and progressive technologies. With these recent developments, fines can be processed, prepared and sold for profit. The current work focused of flotation of discards with the aim to <b>upgrade</b> the quality <b>of</b> <b>coal.</b> Flotation with Montenol 800 and 505 produced a clean coal product with high ash reduction with a very good combustibles recovery after 30 and 35 minutes milling <b>of</b> the fine <b>coal</b> sample, but this has proven to be over milling as coal is soft.

Thus, the implementation for recovery <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> {{particles from}} tailing dams has to depend on methods which used for coal washing and the size distribution of particles (Bu et al. 2017).

Sasol {{is by far}} the world's {{leading company}} in <b>upgrading</b> <b>of</b> low-grade <b>coal</b> into high value {{chemicals}} and fuels. Such plants also utilise fine particles or pulverised coal in the combustion process to generate steam and electricity for their processes. Certain trace elements released from coal during utilisation may be of environmental concern. From the literature findings it appears that the elements of interest are mercury, arsenic and selenium due to their potential health hazard and as they are included in the United States of America, Europe and China Clean Air Act for their potential hazardous effects. It has been observed in the literature that these elements show a nature of high volatility compared {{to the rest of the}} elements and further mercury provides an important chemistry to investigate as it has the ability to accumulate in the food chain. It is likely that environmental legislation in South Africa could be implemented soon to control environmental pollution of selected trace element from coal plants. The toxicity of heavy metals is dependent on the chemical form in which the metal is released. Available analytical techniques for the measurement of trace metals are in many cases not able to differentiate between different chemical species in which the elements occur and are not very reliable at low concentration levels. This makes it difficult to estimate the real environmental impact of the emission of heavy metals as the result <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> processing. The project centred on a study of the partition behaviour <b>of</b> mercury during <b>coal</b> pyrolysis. Some other environmentally important trace elements, e. g. selenium and arsenic were also investigated. The stated aims of the project were reached by the following objectives: 1. Testing of suitable pyrolysis instrumentation. 2. Testing of absorption apparatus. 3. Testing of analytical methods. 4. Comparison <b>of</b> two <b>coal</b> types with regard to trace metal emission 5. Obtaining mass-balance closure with regard to mercury during pyrolysis. 6. Application of the FACTSAGE modelling package Samples were prepared and analysed for trace elements concentrations using advanced analytical techniques including modelling packages for comparison purposes. The conclusions of the project can be summarised as follows: • The partitioning behaviour of trace elements on a plant scale was successfully determined. • The modes of occurrence of some elements of environmental concern were successfully determined. It was not easy to compare these results with literature findings in this area as the coal used in this work was different from that used by other researchers. • The coal pyrolysis process was well understood. • The FACTSAGE package was applied successfully in this project in that it predicted the species of trace elements thus explaining the observed experimental findings, especially the analytical method used to analyse the concentration of mercury in solution. It can be concluded that research should start with theoretical studies like a model than an actual experiment as the model predicts direction of the reaction. Master...|$|R

The results show that full cost <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> is a key factor to influence the price <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> and the optimal allocation of resources, and market pricing system and government supervision mechanism are necessary to ensure the realization of full cost <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> resources...|$|R
