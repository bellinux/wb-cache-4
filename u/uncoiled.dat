In fact, the spirally coiled nature of chitinozoan chains has been used to suggest that they were laid by a spirally coiled organism, such as the gastropods; were this inference true, <b>uncoiled</b> chains could be to be attributed to the (straight) annelid worms or other organisms.|$|E

25|$|During mitosis, microtubules {{grow from}} centrosomes located at {{opposite}} ends of the cell and also attach to the centromere at specialized structures called kinetochores, one of which is present on each sister chromatid. A special DNA base sequence in the region of the kinetochores provides, along with special proteins, longer-lasting attachment in this region. The microtubules then pull the chromatids apart toward the centrosomes, so that each daughter cell inherits one set of chromatids. Once the cells have divided, the chromatids are <b>uncoiled</b> and DNA can again be transcribed. In spite of their appearance, chromosomes are structurally highly condensed, which enables these giant DNA structures to be contained within a cell nucleus.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of ammonite species feature [...] planispiral, flat-coiled shells, but other species feature nearly straight (as in baculites) shells. [...] Still other species' shells are coiled helically, superficially {{like that of}} a large gastropod (as in Turrilites and Bostrychoceras). [...] Some species' shells are even initially <b>uncoiled,</b> then partially coiled, and finally straight at maturity (as in Australiceras). These partially <b>uncoiled</b> and totally <b>uncoiled</b> forms began to diversify mainly during {{the early part of the}} Cretaceous and are known as heteromorphs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{genetic code}} not only {{controls}} inheritance: it also controls gene expression, which {{occurs when a}} portion of the double helix is <b>uncoiled,</b> exposing a series of the nucleotides, which are within the interior of the DNA. This series of exposed triplets (codons) carries the information to allow machinery in the cell to [...] "read" [...] the codons on the exposed DNA, which results in the making of RNA molecules. RNA in turn makes either amino acids or microRNA, which are responsible for all of the structure and function of a living organism; i.e. they determine all the features of the cell and thus the entire individual. Closing the <b>uncoiled</b> segment turns off the gene.|$|E

40|$|The Barremian Leptoceratoidinae, a {{subfamily}} of small-sized heteromorph ammonites, are revised. Despite considerable {{differences in}} the mode of <b>uncoiling,</b> Leptoceratoidinae are considered to represent a monophyletic unit, defined by their small size, simplified suture-lines and ubiquitous Barremian age. Three evolutionary lines are recognized exhibiting,parallel trends of size increase: (1) Karsteniceras with crioconc <b>uncoiling</b> and a planispiral to trochospiral initial coil; (2) Hamulinites with an ancylocone type of <b>uncoiling</b> and a small planispiral initial coil; and (3) a line compromising Eoheteroceras gen. nov. with ancylocone <b>uncoiling</b> and a large trochospiral initial coil, as well as Manoloviceras gen. nov. with only one slightly curved arm and a large trochospiral initial coil. It is inferred that these evolutionary lines originated in Veveysiceras gen. nov. with hamitid-like <b>uncoiling.</b> Veleziceras, with a straight to gently curved shell, is tentatively included in the Leptoceratoidinae, but cannot yet be assigned to one of the three lines defined above. The following new species are described: Karsteniceras ibericum, K. beyrichoide, K. hoheneggeri, K. trinidadense and E. silesiacum, the type species of Eoheteroceras gen. nov. The origin of leptoceratoids remains obscure; they are not closely related to the Berriasian to Valanginian true leptoceratids. Presumably, Eoheteroceras gave rise to the large-sized Heteroceras. Due to the simplified suture-line formula ELUI and the type of <b>uncoiling,</b> the Leptoceratoidinae are included in the Ancyloceratidae. Their evolutionary centre was the southern (Tethyan) margin of the European Plate. From this area, Leptoceratoidinae migrated into the central North Atlantic and even the western Pacific. While Leptoceratoidinae presumably had a vagrant epibenthic mode of life, their dispersal was most probably achieved during their nearshore juvenile stage by the North Equatorial Current...|$|R

2500|$|To {{improve the}} {{efficiency}} of the lamp, the filament usually consists of multiple coils of coiled fine wire, also known as a 'coiled coil'. Light bulbs using coiled coil filaments are sometimes referred to as 'double-coil bulbs'. For a 60-watt 120-volt lamp, the <b>uncoiled</b> length of the tungsten filament is usually , and the filament diameter is [...] The advantage of the coiled coil is that evaporation of the tungsten filament is at the rate of a tungsten cylinder having a diameter equal to that of the coiled coil. The coiled-coil filament evaporates more slowly than a straight filament of the same surface area and light-emitting power. As a result, the filament can then run hotter, which results in a more efficient light source, while reducing the evaporation so that the filament will last longer than a straight filament at the same temperature.|$|E
2500|$|When Polynesian {{seafarers}} {{arrived on}} the Hawaiian Islands in 300–500 AD, few edible plants existed in the new land, aside from ferns (Hāpuʻu ʻiʻi, whose <b>uncoiled</b> fronds are eaten boiled) and fruits that grew at higher elevations. Botanists and archaeologists believe that the Polynesian voyagers introduced anywhere between 27 and more than 30 plants to the islands, known as canoe plants, mainly for food. The most important of them was taro. [...] For centuries taro, and the poi made from it, was the main staple of their diet, {{and it is still}} much loved today. In addition to taro the Polynesians brought yams and sweet potatoes. The latter are believed to have come from Polynesian contact with the New World. The Marquesans, the first settlers from Polynesia, brought breadfruit and the Tahitians later introduced the baking banana. These settlers from Polynesia also brought coconuts, candlenuts (known in Hawaiian as kukui nuts), and sugarcane. They found plenty of fish, shellfish, and limu in the new land. Flightless birds were easy to catch and nests were full of eggs for the taking. Most Pacific islands had no meat animals except bats and lizards, so ancient Polynesians sailed the Pacific with pigs, chickens and dogs as cargo. Pigs were raised for religious sacrifice, and the meat was offered at altars, some of which was consumed by priests and the rest eaten in a mass celebration. The early Hawaiian diet was diverse, and may have included as many as 130 different types of seafood and 230 types of sweet potatoes. [...] Some species of land and sea birds were consumed into extinction.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{understood}} {{for many years}} that a polymer molecule will <b>uncoil</b> in a coil-to-stretch transition when it is placed in an extensional flow with a strain rate exceeding the slowest molecular relaxation rate. This paper looks at the effort which must be exerted to achieve this <b>uncoiling,</b> in other words the transient stress in a dilute solution of such <b>uncoiling</b> polymer molecules. Numerical simulations have been performed of an isolated linear chain of inextensible links which are freely hinged, the chain being placed in an axisymmetric extension flow. Hydrodynamic interactions between the many beads are not included. During the <b>uncoiling,</b> the stress {{is found to be}} mainly dissipative rather than elastic, i. e. the stress is proportional to the instantaneous strain rate rather than being independent of it. A rapid build up of this viscous stress with the total strain is shown to come from the growth of segments of fully stretched chain. The evolution of these segments, the growth in their size along with the reduction of their number, is examined with a simplified ‘kinks dynamics’ model. The above rheological behaviour in transient strong extensional flows is not described by the standard constitutive relations which have been used in the past for dilute polymer solutions, e. g. the Oldroyd-B fluid and FENE dumbbell models. A suitable modification is suggested, which gives large strain-dependent viscous stresses...|$|R

5000|$|Relaxation is not {{an active}} process and energy (in the form of ATP) is not spent during the nicking or {{ligation}} steps; {{this is because the}} reaction between the tyrosine residue at the active site of the enzyme with the phosphodiester DNA backbone simply replaces one phosphomonoester bond with another. The topoisomerase also does not use ATP during <b>uncoiling</b> of the DNA; rather, the torque present in the DNA drives the <b>uncoiling</b> and proceeds on average energetically downhill. Recent single molecule experiments have confirmed what bulk-plasmid relaxation experiments have proposed earlier, which is that <b>uncoiling</b> of the DNA is torque-driven and proceeds until religation occurs. No data suggest that Topo IB [...] "controls" [...] the swiveling insofar as that it has a mechanism in place that triggers religation after a specific number of supercoils removed. On the contrary, single-molecule experiments suggest that religation is a random process and has some probability of occurring each time the swiveling 5'-OH end comes in close proximity with the attachment site of the enzyme-linked 3'-end.|$|R
