Construction on the new project commenced in 2007, and the first phase from 72nd Street to 96th Street opened on January 1, 2017. The planned Phase 2, to East Harlem, will utilize the sections of tunnel north of 96th Street that {{were built in the}} 1970s.|$|E
5|$|When The Great Silence was {{screened}} for Darryl F. Zanuck of 20th Century Fox {{to see whether}} the film could be released on the American market, he was offended by the film (to the point where he reportedly swallowed the cigar he was smoking in shock upon watching the ending), and refused to distribute it in the United States. 20th Century Fox did, however, distribute the film in Italy and several other markets. The company also considered a remake of the film starring Clint Eastwood, which eventually evolved into a largely <b>unrelated</b> <b>project</b> by Universal Pictures, Joe Kidd.|$|E
5|$|After the IND Sixth Avenue Line was {{completed}} in 1940, the city went into great debt, and only 33 new stations {{have been added to}} the system since, nineteen of which were part of defunct railways that already existed. Five stations were on the abandoned New York, Westchester and Boston Railway, which was incorporated into the system in 1941 as the IRT Dyre Avenue Line. Fourteen more stations were on the abandoned LIRR Rockaway Beach Branch (now the IND Rockaway Line), which opened in 1955. Two stations (57th Street and Grand Street) were part of the Chrystie Street Connection, and opened in 1968; the Harlem–148th Street terminal opened that same year in an <b>unrelated</b> <b>project.</b> Six were built as part of a 1968 plan: three on the Archer Avenue Lines, opened in 1988, and three on the 63rd Street Lines, built in 1989. The new South Ferry station was built and connected to the existing Whitehall Street–South Ferry station in 2009. The one-stop 7 Subway Extension to the west side of Manhattan, comprising the 34th Street–Hudson Yards station, was opened in 2015, and three stations on the Second Avenue Subway in the Upper East Side were opened in the beginning of 2017.|$|E

500|$|Carter, Duchovny and Anderson {{celebrated the}} 20th {{anniversary of the}} series at a July 18, 2013 panel at the San Diego Comic-Con hosted by TV Guide. During the discussion, Anderson {{discussed}} Scully's influence on female fans, relating {{that a number of}} women have informed her that they entered into careers in physics because of the character. Anderson also indicated that she was not in favor of an X-Files miniseries, and Duchovny ruled out working with her on an <b>unrelated</b> <b>project,</b> but both expressed willingness to do a third feature film. Carter was more reserved at the idea, stating, [...] "You need a reason to get excited about going on and doing it again." [...] The series attained a degree of historical importance, as well. On July 16, 2008, Carter and Spotnitz donated several props from the series and new film to the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. Some of the items included the original pilot script and the [...] "I Want to Believe" [...] poster from Mulder's office.|$|E
500|$|No. 460 {{was moved}} from Northumberland in October 1969 to the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania in Strasburg. Although {{a part of}} the museum, it was not owned by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission until it was officially donated to the museum in December 1979, by the Penn Central Transportation Company, which {{received}} ownership when the Pennsylvania was merged with the New York Central Railroad. No. 460 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 17, 1979. From 1982 to 1984, volunteers at the museum cleaned the locomotive, replaced wooden window frames and doors, applied rust inhibitor primer and repainted the metal. The locomotive's [...] "asbestos lagging" [...] was removed in 2008. A $400,000 restoration, lasting 3 to 4 years, is planned and is expected to start once an <b>unrelated</b> <b>project</b> at the museum is completed in the summer of 2011. 460 was moved into the museum restoration shops on March 17, 2010 after raising $50,000 and receiving an additional $50,000 donation. From July to August 2010, 460 was [...] "blasted" [...] to remove the several layers of lead paint from the locomotive. The blasting uncovered original timing marks and stamped numbers showing that the origins of some of the parts on 460 were cannibalized from other E6s locomotives. The cosmetic restoration of the 460 was completed in October2016.|$|E
2500|$|The {{station was}} {{forgotten}} until 1977 when Peter Johnson, a geomorphologist {{working on an}} <b>unrelated</b> <b>project,</b> stumbled upon the German weather station. He suspected it was a Canadian military installation, and named it [...] "Martin Bay 7".|$|E

2500|$|The dispute {{was settled}} in private, with Crystal Dynamics {{retaining}} {{the rights to}} the game, and permission to create derivative work using its characters, provided they credit Silicon Knights as the developer of Blood Omen in their sequel. Crystal Dynamics was acquired by Eidos Interactive, who published Soul Reaver in 1999 to critical acclaim and commercial success. Later, it publicly emerged that Soul Reaver had never been a Silicon Knights concept. It originated as Shifter—an <b>unrelated</b> <b>project</b> inspired by Biblical mythology, devised by Crystal Dynamics' Amy Hennig and Seth Carus (both of whom had worked as designers on Blood Omen)—whose team, initially reluctantly, reworked it into a Blood Omen sequel at the request of company management. Successive titles in what was now the Legacy of Kain series were produced by Crystal Dynamics and Eidos, whereas Silicon Knights walked away from the franchise to begin work on Too Human, and later [...]|$|E

25|$|In May 2011, a $294.7-million {{federal grant}} {{was awarded to}} fix {{congestion}} at Harold Interlocking, the USA's second-busiest rail junction after Sunnyside Yard. The work will lay tracks to the New York Connecting Railroad right of way, allowing Amtrak trains arriving from or bound for New England to avoid NJT and LIRR trains. Financing for the project was jeopardized in July 2011 by the House of Representatives, which voted to divert the funding to <b>unrelated</b> <b>projects.</b> The project is currently funded by FRA and the MTA.|$|R
5000|$|In July 2007, Sali {{introduced}} legislation allowing for separate votes on bills that contain multiple subjects.

Clement later admitted that this process was not subject to the oversight that it should have been.|$|R
50|$|In common usage a {{trust fund}} is an estate of money and {{securities}} held in trust for its beneficiaries. The Social Security Trust Fund is quite different. It is an accounting {{of the difference between}} tax and benefit flows. When taxes exceed benefits, the federal government lends itself the excess in return for an interest-paying bond, an IOU that it issues to itself. The government then spends its new funds on <b>unrelated</b> <b>projects</b> such as bridge repairs, defense, or food stamps. The funds are not invested for the benefit of present or future retirees.|$|R

In the early 1950s a minor political debate broke out in Congress about the Navy essentially [...] "owning" [...] ERA, and the ensuing debates and legal wrangling left the company drained of both capital and spirit.

My 6. uap project focused on designing a forum module {{for a different}} kind of learning management system – a speedy, free, secure lms written in the Ur/Web research language. While I didn’t accomplish all my initial goals, I did produce a reasonably-sized body of Ur/Web code suitable for others to build upon in future development of both the proposed lms and other, <b>unrelated</b> <b>projects.</b> I also identified a number of Ur/Web design patterns (and anti-patterns); I believe that promoting this “soft ” knowledge is the royal road to widespread Ur/Web deployment. ...|$|R

Unlike Palmer's Titanic II, the all-Chinese replica is not intended to sail on any ocean but will be permanently docked within a reservoir. [...] The finished ship, which is already under construction, is scheduled to be completed in 2019, although the initial completion date was 2018. Since Palmer has also cited 2018 as his new target date, and both ships would be built by Chinese workers, the <b>unrelated</b> <b>projects</b> are prone to confusion.|$|R
