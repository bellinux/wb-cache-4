5|$|The NTFS {{file system}} used by recent {{versions}} of Windows stores the file with a <b>UTC</b> <b>time</b> stamp, but displays it corrected to local—or seasonal—time. However, the FAT filesystem commonly used on removable devices stores only the local time. Consequently, when a file is copied {{from the hard}} disk onto separate media, its time will be set to the current local time. If the time adjustment is changed, the timestamps of the original file and the copy will be different. The same effect can be observed when compressing and uncompressing files with some file archivers. It is the NTFS file that changes seen time. This effect {{should be kept in}} mind when trying to determine if a file is a duplicate of another, although there are other methods of comparing files for equality (such as using a checksum algorithm).|$|E
25|$|The <b>UTC</b> <b>time</b> standard, {{which is}} widely used for {{international}} timekeeping and as the reference for civil time in most countries, uses the international system (SI) definition of the second, based on atomic clocks. Like most time standards, UTC defines a grouping of seconds into minutes, hours, days, months, and years. However, the duration of one mean solar day is now slightly longer (by roughly 0.001 seconds) than 24 hours (86400 SI seconds) because {{the rotation of the}} Earth has slowed down. Therefore, if the UTC day were defined as precisely 86400 SI seconds, the UTC time-of-day would slowly drift apart from that of solar-based standards, such as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and its successor UT1. The purpose of a leap second is to compensate for this drift, by occasionally scheduling some UTC days with 86401 or (in principle) 86399 SI seconds.|$|E

Nautical time zone letters are not used {{with the exception of}} Z. To calculate <b>UTC</b> <b>time</b> one has to subtract the offset from the local time, e.g. for [...] "15:0003:30" [...] do 15:00 [...] (03:30) to get 18:30 UTC.|$|E
2500|$|In 1972, the {{leap-second}} {{system was}} introduced {{so that the}} broadcast UTC seconds could be made exactly equal to the standard SI second, while still maintaining the <b>UTC</b> <b>time</b> of day and changes of UTC date synchronized with those of UT1 (the solar time standard that superseded GMT). By then, the UTC clock was already 10 seconds behind TAI, which had been synchronized with UT1 in 1958, but had been counting true SI seconds since then. After 1972, both clocks have been ticking in SI seconds, so the difference between their readouts at any time is 10 seconds plus {{the total number of}} leap seconds that have been applied to UTC (37 seconds [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|The {{offset from}} UTC is {{appended}} {{to the time}} {{in the same way that}} 'Z' was above, in the form ±:, ±, or ±. [...] So if the time being described is one hour ahead of UTC (such as the time in Berlin during the winter), the zone designator would be [...] "+01:00", [...] "+0100", or simply [...] "+01". To represent a time behind UTC the offset is negative. For example, the time in New York during standard (not daylight saving) hours is [...] For other time offsets see List of <b>UTC</b> <b>time</b> offsets. To represent a negative offset, ISO 8601 specifies using either a hyphenminus or a minus sign character. If the interchange character set is limited and does not have a minus sign character, then the hyphenminus should be used. [...] ASCII does not have a minus sign, so its hyphenminus character (code is 45 decimal or 2D hexadecimal) would be used. If the character set has a minus sign, then that character should be used. Unicode has a minus sign, and its character code is U+2212 (2212 hexadecimal); the HTML character entity invocation is &minus;.|$|E
