60|$|In that {{skeleton}} {{there are}} a number of parts to be recognized. The long series of bones, beginning from the skull and ending in the tail, is called the spine, and those in front are the ribs; and then there are two pairs of limbs, one before and one behind; and there are what we all know as the fore-legs and the hind-legs. If we pursue our researches into the interior of this animal, we find within the framework of the skeleton a great cavity, or rather, I should say, two great cavities,--one cavity beginning in the skull and running through the neck-bones, along the spine, and ending in the tail, containing the brain and the spinal marrow, which are extremely important organs. The second great cavity, commencing with the mouth, contains the gullet, the stomach, the long intestine, and all the rest of those internal apparatus which are essential for digestion; and then in the same great cavity, there are lodged the heart and all the great vessels going from it; and, besides that, the organs of respiration--the lungs: and then the kidneys, and the organs of reproduction, and so on. Let us now endeavour to reduce this notion of a horse that we now have, to some such kind of simple expression as can be at once, and without difficulty, retained in the mind, apart from all minor details. If I make a transverse section, that is, if I were to saw a dead horse across, I should find that, if I left out the details, and supposing I took my section through the anterior region, and through the fore-limbs, I should have here this kind of section of the body (Fig. 1).

Soil water potential in the <b>upper</b> <b>tubes</b> did not differ under local and uniform drought during the first 16 days post-treatment, when it approached - 125 kPa. Thereafter, the water potential of soil under uniform drought continued to decrease, while that under local drought stabilized at approximately - 150 kPa. Treatments had no consistent effects on female T. semipenetrans counts from soil or roots. However, after 37 days, numbers of eggs, juvenile, and male nematodes per gram of root under local drought were more than 2. 4 -fold greater than those under non-drought or uniform drought. Numbers of juvenile and male nematodes in soil were 6. 5 times higher under local drought than under non-drought after 37 days. Nematodes did not survive in soil under uniform drought.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. As boiling outside horizontal tube bundle designs {{can result in a}} seemingly large number of combinations of heat flux, quality and bundle geometry, it needs to be studied as to how the various permutations might effect the flow path of liquid through a tube bundle in a boiling mode. Thus the probable effect on the heat transfer due to a disruption in the wetting (partial dry-out) of <b>upper</b> <b>tubes</b> in a bundle and the possible influence of a variation in the tube pitch so as to affect the wetting and dry-out characteristics of a tube needs to be established. Experiments conducted for pool boiling in 8 x 3 (eight rows and three columns) plain and coated tubes (Ra = 8. 279 μm) bundles for three different inter-tube pitch distances (p/d= 1. 4, 1. 7 and 2. 0) in an equilateral triangular arrangement using distilled water at atmospheric conditions revealed that the local heat transfer coefficient for a tube in a bundle increased with an increase in heat flux as well as with a decrease in the pitch distance. The coated tube bundles with the minimum pitch (p/d= 1. 4) exhibited the maximum bundle average heat transfer coefficients. The circumferential variation of heat transfer coefficient for the tubes suggest the lowest values for the upper surface of the tube periphery due to a coalescence of bubbles near the top surface while the highest values were observed nearer to the lower surface of the tube periphery due to the striking bubbles from the lower tubes. The experimental data is best fit to suggest a suitable correlation for the enhancement ratio in local pool boiling heat transfer coefficient (hnpb,local/hbottom tube) for the plain and coated tube bundles taking into account the local void fraction and the p/d ratio where the void fraction is calculated using an iterative procedure beginning with the homogeneous void fraction as the initial guess and iterated until the assumed and calculated values agree within a precision of 0. 0001 and valid for heat flux ranging from ~ 12 to 45 kW/m 2.

A compact tube bundle made up of 30 stainless steel tubes of outer diameter 3 nun, pitch diameter ratio 1. 5 and heating length of 50 nun was designed to. permit the measurement of flow boiling heat transfer coefficient from tubes within the bundle.

Results obtained showed that the heat transfer coefficient was predominantly dependent on the heat flux as opposed to mass flux. Macro scale models were compared with the experimental results and none of these models predicted the experimental results well. The Confinement number (Co) developed for flow boiling inside micro channels was applied to compact tube bundles and it was shown that confinement is expected ~o be significant for Co> 0. 63.

In these patients a total of 65 endoscopic investigations were performed, in 94 % the foreign bodies were removed endoscopically (48 / 51 patients), in three cases the endoscopic procedures were not successful. Among the foreign bodies removed were various metal or plastic objects: coins, keys, screws, hooks, batteries, razor blades, needles, parts of kitchen, toilet or writing utensils, lighters, buttons, toys, a toothbrush as well as impacted pieces of bone. In the patients with successful endoscopic removal of the objects, no significant complications were noted. In 3 patients (3 / 48, 6. 3 %) only mild hemorrhages from the region of the esophagogastric junction were observed. Conclusions: The technological development of endoscopic instruments made it possible to carry out different therapeutic procedures. The method has proved successful in removing foreign bodies from the <b>upper</b> digestive <b>tube.</b> Various factors affect the success of the procedure, the more important being adequate equipment, the experience and patience of the investigator and the assisting nurse, as well as the patient’s understanding of the procedure and his or her cooperation. </p...|$|R
50|$|Swedish company Interdynamic AB of Stockholm {{designed}} the Interdynamic MP-9 9mm submachine gun. Interdynamic intended {{it as an}} inexpensive submachine gun based on the Carl Gustav M/45 for military applications, but did not find a government buyer, so it {{was taken to the}} US market as an open-bolt semi-automatic pistol. The open-bolt design was deemed too easy to convert to full auto. Because of this, the ATF forced Interdynamic to redesign it into a closed-bolt system, which was harder to convert to full auto. This variant was called the KG-99. It made frequent appearances on Miami Vice, where it was legally converted to full auto by Title II manufacturers. The KG-9 and KG-99 have an open-end <b>upper</b> receiver <b>tube</b> where the bolt, recoil springs, and buffer plate are held in place by the plastic/polymer lower receiver frame. This design only allows for 115 grain 9mm ammunition. If heavier grain ammunition or hot loads are used, the plastic lower receiver will fail or crack, rendering the firearm unusable. The later model TEC-9 and AB-10 have a threaded <b>upper</b> receiver <b>tube</b> at the rear and a screw-on end cap to contain the bolt, recoil spring, and buffer plate even if removed from the lower receiver. This solves the problem of lower receiver failure when using hot ammo.|$|R
50|$|The Goncz {{action is}} an {{original}} design {{and does not}} copy other actions. This design utilizes a blowback-operated telescopic bolt system housed in the <b>upper</b> receiver <b>tube.</b> The bolt travels on a firing rod which protrudes through the bolt, left of center, next to the firing pin, and a guide rod located {{at the top of}} the bolt. Both rods and their corresponding springs are attached to the spring holder base plate. A recoil buffer sits on the base plate to prevent damage to the bolt when cycling.|$|R
