50|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in 2009, and identified as phylogenetically distinct in 2016. The American Ornithologists' Union {{failed to find}} consensus {{on the issue of}} splitting the species from the <b>red</b> <b>crossbill</b> in 2009. However, in their 2017 update, the AOU reached consensus and split the Cassia <b>crossbill</b> from the <b>red</b> <b>crossbill.</b>|$|R

50|$|Bird populations include <b>red</b> <b>crossbill,</b> winter wren, veery, black-capped chickadee, Blackburnian warbler, rosebreasted grosbeak, and cerulean warblers; birds {{found in}} high_elevations and deep-woods.|$|R
50|$|Within its Eurasian range, {{this species}} is smaller-headed and smaller-billed than parrot {{crossbill}} and Scottish crossbill, so the main confusion species both {{there and in}} North America is common or <b>red</b> <b>crossbill.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In North America, nine {{distinct}} <b>red</b> <b>crossbill</b> variants (referred to as call types) differing in vocalizations {{as well as}} beak {{size and}} shape are recognized. [...] Each call type evolved to specialize on different species of conifer.|$|R
50|$|The Newfoundland <b>red</b> <b>{{crossbill}}</b> is {{a member}} of the crossbill genus which has its crossed bill adapted for prying open the tightly closed spruce or pine cones in order to extract the seeds found abundantly on the island of Newfoundland.|$|R
50|$|Work on {{vocalisation}} in North America {{suggests that}} there are eight or nine discrete populations of <b>red</b> <b>crossbill</b> in that continent alone, which do not interbreed and are (like the named species) adapted to specialise in different conifer species. While several ornithologists seem inclined to give these forms species status, no division of the American <b>red</b> <b>crossbills</b> has yet occurred. Preliminary investigations in Europe and Asia suggest an equal, if not greater, complexity, with several different call types identified; these call types being as different from each other as from the named species Scottish and parrot crossbills - suggesting either that they are valid species, or else that the Scottish and parrot may not be.|$|R
25|$|Additionally, opportunists {{can have}} qualities of {{seasonal}} breeders. The <b>red</b> <b>crossbill</b> exhibits a preference (not a requirement) for long-day seasonality, but requires other factors, especially food abundance and social interactions, {{in order to}} breed. Conversely, food availability by itself incompletely promotes reproductive development.|$|R
50|$|The <b>red</b> <b>crossbill</b> (Loxia curvirostra) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird in the finch family Fringillidae, {{also known}} as the common crossbill in Eurasia. Crossbills have distinctive mandibles, crossed at the tips, which enable them to extract seeds from conifer cones and other fruits.|$|R
50|$|Some pine-feeding populations {{currently}} {{assigned to}} <b>red</b> <b>crossbill</b> in southern Europe may possibly be better referred to either this species or alternatively to new species {{in their own}} right, but as yet, research into them is still {{at a very early}} stage.|$|R
5000|$|Southern {{mountain}} cranberry, intermediate shield fern, Indian cucumber root, fire pink, wild sarsaparilla, bloodroot, {{black cohosh}} and white snake root are found along {{the tops of}} the mountains. Bird species include cerulean warblers, <b>red</b> <b>crossbills,</b> winter wrens and black throated green warblers.|$|R
50|$|The <b>red</b> <b>crossbill</b> breeds in the spruce {{forests of}} North America, {{as well as}} Europe and Asia. Some populations breed in pine forests in certain areas of all three continents, and in North America, also in Douglas-fir. It nests in conifers, laying 3-5 eggs.|$|R
50|$|This bird breeds in {{the pine}} forests of {{northwest}} Europe and into western Russia. There {{is also a}} small population in Scotland, adding {{to the difficulty of}} distinguishing it from <b>red</b> <b>crossbill</b> and the endemic Scottish crossbill, both of which breed within its range.|$|R
50|$|Adult males {{tend to be}} red or pinkish in colour, {{and females}} green or yellow, but there is much variation. Two-barred is easier to {{identify}} than other crossbills, especially in North America, where only <b>red</b> <b>crossbill</b> and this species occur, but some care is still needed.|$|R
25|$|The wooded slopes are host {{to their}} own bird species, in {{particular}} the ring ouzel, the common raven, and the golden eagle. More generally, the forests have Eurasian three-toed woodpeckers, parrot <b>crossbills,</b> <b>red</b> <b>crossbills,</b> common redstarts , bramblings and Siberian jays, which last bird is {{the symbol of the}} park.|$|R
50|$|As a {{child he}} had been {{influenced}} by John James Audubon's The Birds of America. At the age of fourteen, {{he made his first}} painting of a bird, a male <b>red</b> <b>crossbill,</b> from life. He learned to keep careful records of the appearance, habits and voices of birds.|$|R
50|$|This area is {{appreciated}} for its birdwatching opportunities {{including some}} Arizona specialties such as hummingbirds, trogons, and tyrant flycatchers, including some rare birds {{such as the}} blue-throated, white-eared, and berylline hummingbirds; also buff-breasted flycatchers; and black-throated gray, red-faced, and Grace's warblers; also <b>red</b> <b>crossbills</b> and numerous other bird species.|$|R

50|$|The park {{provides}} summer breeding {{habitat for}} numerous birds, {{but only a}} few species remain over winter. Classic Boundary Waters birds like the common loon, bald eagle, osprey, common raven, and gray jay are all present. Other notable residents include the red-breasted nuthatch, pine grosbeak, <b>red</b> <b>crossbill,</b> and boreal chickadee.|$|R
25|$|Arthropods and {{molluscs}} found include millipedes, collembolans, spiders, beetles, slugs, {{and various}} centipedes. Animals that inhabit the Northern Coast range are weevils, chipmunks, bears, rabbits, white-footed deer mice, Columbian Black tail deer, and others. Birds include chickadees, red-breasted nuthatches, kinglets, Western pileated woodpeckers, Oregon gray jays, California creepers, and Sitka <b>red</b> <b>crossbills</b> among others.|$|R
50|$|The British Ornithologists Union first classed the Scottish {{crossbill}} as {{a separate}} and distinct species in 1980, but some ornithologists believed there was insufficient scientific research for its status. It {{was considered to be}} possibly a race of either the <b>red</b> <b>crossbill</b> or the parrot crossbill, both of which also occur in the Caledonian Forest.|$|R
50|$|This {{crossbill}} {{is mainly}} resident, but will irregularly irrupt south if its food source fails. The American race seems to wander {{more frequently than}} the Eurasian subspecies. This species will form flocks outside the breeding season, often mixed with other crossbills. It is a rare visitor to western Europe, usually arriving with an irruption of <b>red</b> <b>crossbills.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} {{difficult}} to separate from parrot crossbill and Scottish crossbill, both of which breed within its Eurasian range, as plumage distinctions from those two species are negligible, though the head and bill are smaller than in either of the other species. Care is needed in identification, especially in Eurasia, where the glip or chup call {{is probably the best}} indicator. The identification problem is less severe in North America, where only <b>red</b> <b>crossbill</b> and White-winged crossbill occur. However, there has been debate as to whether different call types should be considered separate species. For example, the South Hills crossbill, occurring in the South Hills and Albion Mountains in Idaho {{has been described as a}} new species (Loxia sinesciuris) because it shows a very low degree of hybridization with the <b>red</b> <b>crossbill.</b> There are also genetic differences between the call type populations. Nevertheless, few ornithologists have chosen to give these forms species status.|$|R
25|$|The {{shape or}} {{color of the}} culmen can also help with the {{identification}} of birds in the field. For example, the culmen of the parrot crossbill is strongly decurved, while that of the very similar <b>red</b> <b>crossbill</b> is more moderately curved. The culmen of a juvenile common loon is all dark, while that of the very similarly plumaged juvenile yellow-billed loon is pale towards the tip.|$|R
50|$|The {{wilderness}} {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of animals. Mule deer are a common sight in the mornings and late afternoons. There are a large number of squirrels including the Kaibab squirrel. Other more rare animals include pronghorn deer and mountain lions. There are also a variety of lizards in the area including horned lizards. Birds present include <b>red</b> <b>crossbills,</b> Steller's jays, common ravens and many others.|$|R
5|$|The South Hills {{crossbill}} is a finch {{endemic to}} the South Hills and Albion Mountains in the Minidoka District. It rarely interbreeds with similar crossbills that {{are present in}} its range, {{and it has been}} proposed as a separate species created via ecological speciation. The American Ornithologists' Union failed to find consensus on the issue so the South Hills crossbill is still considered a subspecies of the <b>red</b> <b>crossbill.</b>|$|R
50|$|Forested {{parts of}} the {{mountain}} include Sitka spruce, western redcedar, Douglas-fir, and western hemlock.Other plant life native to the mountain are Coptis laciniata, salmonberry, salal, sword fern, Oregon grape, bracken fern, and others.Insects may include millipedes, collembolans, spiders, beetles, and various centipedes. Animals that inhabit the area are weasels, chipmunks. black bears, snowshoe hares and deer. Birds include chickadees, kinglets, woodpeckers, jays, brown creepers, and <b>red</b> <b>crossbills</b> among others.|$|R
50|$|It is very {{probable}} {{that there is}} a genetic basis underlying the phenomenon (young birds whose bills are still straight will give a cone-opening behavior if their bills are gently pressed, and the crossing develops before the birds are fledged and feeding independently), but at least in the <b>red</b> <b>crossbill</b> (the only species which has been somewhat thoroughly researched regarding this question) there is no straightforward mechanism of heritability.|$|R

25|$|Pinus strobus {{is found}} in the nearctic {{temperate}} broadleaf and mixed forests biome of eastern North America. It prefers well-drained or sandy soils and humid climates, but can also grow in boggy areas and rocky highlands. In mixed forests, this dominant tree towers over many others, including some of the large broadleaf hardwoods. It provides food and shelter for numerous forest birds, such as the <b>red</b> <b>crossbill,</b> and small mammals such as squirrels.|$|R
50|$|Birds spotted at {{the park}} include lesser goldfinch, broad-tailed hummingbird, spotted towhee, Woodhouse's scrub jay, common raven. In May, vireo, flycatcher, and western tanager, and the yellow, Virginia, and orange-crowned warbler may be seen during their migratory journey. The fall {{can be a good}} time to spot towhee, jay, junco, Say's phoebe, <b>red</b> <b>crossbill,</b> and pine siskin. Duck, raptor, bald eagle, wild turkey, and rough-legged hawk may be spotted in the winter. Many other {{varieties}} have been spotted.|$|R
50|$|The {{green sandpiper}} (Tringa ochropus) {{and the common}} gull (Larus canus) are typical {{freshwater}} birds in the river habitat. Other bird species include the common chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs), the willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus), the tree pipit (Anthus trivialis), the common redpoll (Carduelis flammea), the great tit (Parus major), the spotted flycatcher (Muscicapa striata), the <b>red</b> <b>crossbill</b> (Loxia curvirostra), the Eurasian treecreeper (Certhia familiaris), the wood warbler (Phylloscopus sibilatrix), the greenish warbler (Phylloscopus trochiloides) and the goldcrest (Regulus regulus).|$|R
40|$|Socially {{acquired}} information {{improves the}} accuracy {{and efficiency of}} environmental assessments and can increase fitness. Public information may be especially useful during unpredictable food conditions, or for species that depend on resources made less predictable by human disturbance. However, the physiological mechanisms by which direct foraging assessments and public information are integrated to affect behaviour remain largely unknown. We tested for potential effects of public information on the behavioural and hormonal response to food reduction by manipulating the social environment of captive <b>red</b> <b>crossbills</b> (Loxia curvirostra). Red crossbills are irruptive migrants that are considered sensitive to changes in food availability and use public information in decision making. Here, we show that public information can attenuate or intensify the release of glucocorticoids (i. e. stress hormones) during food shortage in <b>red</b> <b>crossbills.</b> The observed modulation of corticosterone may therefore be a physiological mechanism linking public information, direct environmental assessments and behavioural change. This mechanism would not only allow for public information to affect individual behaviour, but might also facilitate group decision making by bringing group members into more similar physiological states. The results further suggest that stressors affecting entire populations may be magnified in individual physiology through social interactions...|$|R
2500|$|The ranch {{supports}} {{a wide variety}} of wildlife including cougar, mule deer, pronghorn antelope, coyote, and jackrabbits. [...] Bird species native to the area include sage grouse, mountain chickadees, gray-headed juncos, black-throated gray warbler, Virginia's warbler, MacGillivray's warbler, pine siskin, <b>red</b> <b>crossbill,</b> bushtit, hermit thrush, and northern goshawks, ravens, and eagles. [...] Creeks on the Whitehorse Ranch are home to Lahontan cutthroat trout. [...] To preserve the riparian ecosystem, the ranch keeps cattle away from creek banks during critical times of the year.|$|R
5000|$|Sewall {{explored}} {{the variation in}} learned bird songs in relation to social and genetic intermixing of families of <b>red</b> <b>crossbills</b> (Loxia curvirostra). [...] When given to foster parents, it was shown that fledgling crossbills will imitate the particular variations in their foster parents' calls. It was thus hypothesized that such idiosyncrasies in call could aid in creating familial cohesion and that when such call variants are passed down generations, those variants are direct signals of the crossbill's genetic and familial history.|$|R
500|$|Ganoga Lake {{is on the}} Allegheny Plateau {{just north}} of the Allegheny Front; this region is known locally as North Mountain. Many bird species are found in the forests on North Mountain, {{including}} the state's only population of blackpoll warbler; other birds seen there include evening grosbeak, northern goshawk, <b>red</b> <b>crossbill,</b> and Swainson's thrush. Historically North Mountain was home to olive-sided flycatcher, and [...] "was {{one of the few places}} one could enjoy the songs of all of Pennsylvania's native thrushes"; today it is home to the state's largest yellow-bellied flycatcher population.|$|R
