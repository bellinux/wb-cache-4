40|$|Background and Purpose—Further {{research}} is needed to better identify the methods of evaluating processes and outcomes of stroke care. We investigated whether achieving 4 evidence-based components of a care bundle in a Scotland-wide population with ischemic stroke is associated with 30 -day and 6 -month outcomes. Methods—Using national datasets, we looked at the effect of 4 standards (stroke <b>unit</b> <b>entry</b> on calendar day of admission [day 0] or day following [day 1], aspirin on day 0 or day 1, scan on day 0, and swallow screen recorded on day 0) on mortality and discharge to usual residence, at 30 days and 6 months. Data were corrected for the validated 6 simple variables, admission year, and hospital-level random effects. Results—A total of 36 055 patients were included. Achieving stroke unit admission, swallow screen, and aspirin standards were associated with reduced 30 -day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [95...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To measure patients' {{risk for}} {{acquiring}} antibiotic-resistant microorganisms associated with {{intensive care unit}} admission. Design: Prospective, observational study. Setting: Ten public hospitals including one university medical center. Patients: Consecutive patients admitted to ten intensive care units. Interventions: Serial patient surveillance cultures were screened for vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), ceftazidime-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (CR-GNB), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, and antibiotic and medical device exposures. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 1, 697 patient admissions in ten intensive care units were enrolled. The overall carriage rate of antibiotic-resistant bacteria at intensive care <b>unit</b> <b>entry</b> was 12. 1 % for MRSA, 14 % for CR-GNB and 4. 7 % for both. At discharge from the intensive care unit, new carriage of MRSA, CR-GNB, and both was found in 11. 1 %, 14. 2 %, and 2. 4 % of the patients, respectively. The acquisition rates in the individual units correlated highly and positively with proportion of patients with carriage at intensive care <b>unit</b> <b>entry</b> for both MRSA (n = 10, Pearson's r =. 89, p < 0. 001) and CR-GNB (n = 10, Pearson's r =. 92, p < 0. 001). By logistic regression, severity of illness (odds ratio, 1. 4), length of stay (odds ratio, 1. 7), use of penicillins (odds ratio, 1. 9), and number of antibiotics (odds ratio, 1. 2) and medical devices (odds ratio, 1. 2) were independently associated with intensive care unit acquisition of MRSA. In comparison, variables independently associated with intensive care unit acquisition of CR-GNB were Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (odds ratio, 1. 5), number of antibiotics (odds ratio, 1. 1), and artificial airway (odds ratio, 1. 5). Conclusions: These data suggest that hospitalization {{in the intensive care}} unit introduces significant risk to patients in terms of transmission of MRSA and/or CR-GNB. This risk seems to be influenced strongly by the proportion of patients with colonization at intensive care unit admission and is associated with severity of illness, length of stay, and exposures to antibiotics and medical devices. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare 2 {{models for}} {{managing}} patients {{admitted to a}} subacute medical intensive care unit (MICU) who required prolonged mechanical ventilation (> 7 d). METHODS: The sub-jects were 192 consecutive patients (mean SD age 61. 5 16. 1 y, 52 % male, 86 % white) managed during alternating 7 -month blocks of time by an attending physician in collaboration with an acute care nurse practitioner (ACNP) (n 98 patients) or by an attending physician in collaboration with critical care/pulmonary fellows (n 94 patients). The total observation time was 28 months (14 mo per team). RESULTS: At <b>unit</b> <b>entry,</b> {{there were no significant}} differences in age, sex, race, comor-bidity, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III score, or time of tracheostomy between the patients managed by the 2 teams. Patients managed by the ACNP team were more likely to have required mechanical ventilation due to an acute pulmonary problem (p 0. 005). At subacute MICU discharge, the groups were not significantly different in regard to subacute MICU length of stay, days on mechanical ventilation, or discharge weaning status (p> 0. 05). The number of readmissions to the MICU was similar for the ACNP team (n 7) and fellows team (n 8), as were readmissions to the subacute MICU < 72 h after discharge (ACNP 2, fellows 1). Each team had 2 deaths without treatment limitation. CONCLUSION: As hypothesized, management of pa-tients who required prolonged mechanical ventilation with tracheostomy had equivalent outcomes with the ACNP team or the fellows team. Key words: prolonged mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, acute care nurse practitioner, medical intensive care unit, critical care, weaning.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of {{the process by which}} polymerising free radicals are created is of fundamental importance for any type of free radical polymerisation system. In the case of emulsion polymerisation this process is {{complicated by the fact that}} free radicals are usually generated in the aqueous phase, while the principal site of polymerisation is the interior of hydrophobic latex particles. This thesis details a study of the kinetics and mechanism for radical entry into latex particles in-emulsion polymerisation. A systematic investigation is carried out identifying the influences of initiator, monomer and particle surface type on the entry efficiency. Experimental entry efficiencies are obtained from a range of seeded styrene emulsion polymerisation systems at 50 °C, employing potassium peroxodisulfate and 2, 2 ' -azobis-(2 -methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride as initiators, and using latex particles stabilised by positive or negative surface charge. Changing either initiator or particle type is seen to affect the entry efficiency. Experimental results are able to be rationalised in terms of an existing theory for entry which suggests that entry occurs for persulfate-derived radicals after addition to two styrene monomer units, and for amidinium-derived radicals after addition to only one styrene monomer <b>unit.</b> <b>Entry</b> efficiencies are also obtained from seeded experiments at 50 °C using persulfate as initiator and methyl methacrylate as monomer, with considerably greater uncertainty arising in this case due to unexplained variations in the "acceleration" during Interval II of polymerisation. Comparison with entry theory for this system indicates that entry occurs for a persulfate-derived radical only after addition to at least 20 methyl methacrylate monomer units. Attempts to confirm this inferred value by analysis of aqueous-phase oligomers using mass spectrometry and gel-permeation chromatography are inconclusive. In the hope of improving the accuracy with which entry rate, data may be obtained from kinetic experiments the following investigations into more other aspects of emulsion polymerisation kinetics are carried out. The contribution to entry from spontaneous polymerisation is measured for a wide range of styrene and methyl methacrylate systems and various mechanistic inferences are made. The particle surface and aqueous phase are identified as likely loci for spontaneous radical generation. The nature of chain stopping reactions in emulsion polymerisations of methyl methacrylate at 50 °C are investigated through kinetic experiments and analysis of polymer molecular weight distributions. The radical chain length distribution is found to be approximately ''transfercontrolled", and both kinetic data and molecular weight distributions are well described by current models for termination and the effects of column broadening in gel-permeation chromatography. A new kinetic model for emulsion polymerisation is developed which extends the Smith-Ewart treatment to take account of all reactions of monomeric and aqueous-phase radicals. This new model treats exit and re-entry in terms of elementary physical and chemical processes, employing microscopic rate parameters and obviating the use of less meaningful parameters, such as k and a, which have traditionally been required for non-zero-one systems. The model is applied to the styrene and methyl methacrylate systems used in experimental work and confirms the accuracy of the entry data obtained using existing methods. However, no improvement in the fitting of methyl methacrylate acceleration data is obtained from using the new model with best estimates for all parameter values. Finally, new approaches to modelling entry are proposed which may overcome the limitations posed by existing entry models. Most importantly, recommendations are made for including the kinetics of adsorption, desorption and entry of all aqueous radicals...|$|E
