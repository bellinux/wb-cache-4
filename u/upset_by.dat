40|$|Ring {{upsetting}} {{represents a}} basic operation for bulk forming process and has particular significance {{since it is}} used for contact friction determination. At ring <b>upsetting</b> <b>by</b> flat dies, metal flow depends upon tribological conditions present at contact surface. Thereby, two variants of metal flow are possible: a) two-way flow from neutral radius that is present at lower friction coefficient values, followed by ring’s inner radius reduction and ring’s outer radius increase. In such circumstances, neutral radius is found between inner and outer radius. b) one-way flow that occurs at higher friction coefficient values, where neutral radius is lower than ring’s inner radius. This paper is presenting the results of determination of relation between neutral radius value and friction coefficient. Such relation is determined by numerical simulation, by using Simufact. Forming software. Experimental verification of neutral radius position is conducted by metallographic analysis, for two friction coefficient values. Friction coefficient values are determined <b>by</b> ring <b>upsetting</b> <b>by</b> using dies, where in one case of ring upsetting, contact surfaces were ion implanted with nitroge...|$|R
