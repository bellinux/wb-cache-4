40|$|This article links two {{processes}} that reached culmination during the 1970 s: the emergence in central government {{of concern for}} inner city areas, and the rejection of <b>urban</b> <b>modernist</b> approaches to the built environment. It focuses on {{the approach of the}} Department of the Environment in dealing with the issue, particularly through the three Inner Area Studies on Lambeth, Small Heath in Birmingham and Liverpool 8, which were published in 1977. The first section gives an account of the background under which the Studies were commissioned by the Department of the Environment, then headed by Conservative Secretary of State Peter Walker. Part two gives a brief account of the Studies. Part three details their reception under the Labour Government, and shows their influence on the 1977 White Paper Policy for the Inner Cities. Through this case study two arguments are made about the changing approach to the built environment in the 1970 s: that political and planning elites played a pivotal role in the disavowal of urban modernism in this period; and that the multiple problems exemplified by the inner city made modernist approaches appear increasingly untenable, even to former advocates. The conclusion suggests that, at least in its approach to the inner city, the meliorist aims of the post-war period were not an intellectually spent force by the 1970 s, but remained an ambitious and evolving project...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{contemporary art}} in India between circa 1965 and 1995, focusing especially on artistic developments in Bombay, the leading artistic, cultural, commercial, and cosmopolitan center of post-colonial and post-partition India, {{and the main}} site from which contemporary Indian art reached international art world networks. This study argues that 1965 – 1995 is a critical and historically distinct, if under-recognized, period in which urban conditions and experience were focal {{in the development and}} articulation of Indian cultural identities. Among the achievements and issues framing this period were the foundation of sustainable art world infrastructure (including private galleries for exhibition and sites for criticism and discourse), negotiations between 2 ̆ 2 local 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 international 2 ̆ 2 currents in cultural production, and struggles to locate a place for the professional artist in Indian society. ^ My dissertation uses case studies of five defining artists to build an historical narrative that is rooted in artistic, urban, intellectual, and discursive conditions in India in this period. The artists are Tyeb Mehta, Akbar Padamsee, Bhupen Khakhar, Sudhir Patwardhan, and Atul Dodiya. Each case study moves between visual analyses of artworks, narrations of specific issues in each artist 2 ̆ 7 s professional life, and developments in the urban and intellectual contexts and art worlds in which each artist was working. While independently, each study focuses on individual creative expressions and commitments, collectively they suggest that over this period these artists articulated—and then challenged—an identity for <b>urban</b> <b>modernist</b> art practice in India. Using object-based visual analyses, archival resources, and interviews, this study is based mostly on primary sources drawn from extensive research in India. ^ My research demonstrates the need for a new assessment of the discourse and language used to describe contemporary Indian art; this is primarily to prioritize a history for twentieth-century Indian art in which art, artists, and ideas originating in India support the discourse, rather than structures proposed and often superimposed by 2 ̆ 2 Western Modernism 2 ̆ 2 and related theoretical constructs. This dissertation offers a new conceptual framework and a historically contingent, interpretive narrative through which to look at a period of contemporary Indian art in relation to broader post-colonial and art histories. ...|$|E

40|$|Modernist areas {{represent}} the ambivalent idea {{to live in}} a green city, which can provide light and air of open landscapes, and on the same time host facilities of an <b>urban</b> environment. <b>Modernist</b> areas as the Western Garden Cities in Amsterdam are also ambiguous spaces, their form shaped mainly by flowing open space. The ambiguity of space is related to its organisation, if the territorial order is missing, urban space tends to become non-legible. Recent fieldwork in Amsterdam showed that more businesses than assumed are located in this large area, which was planned and is generally still thought of as widely separated in functions. The infiltration with new businesses took also place at locations that were not used by businesses before. The changing use of built material changes partially also the territorial depth. Businesses can currently be found in four different types of territorial depth regarding the distance from the public street to the individual user unit, creating sometimes even more overlap between public and private. The ambiguity of the large open green spaces is affected only little by the higher activation of the area. UrbanismArchitectur...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} {{of space in}} postwar UK towns, whether bomb damaged or not, was characterised {{by a series of}} authoritative planning reports, vividly illustrated by perspective drawings and maps. In this paper aspects of the imagery and {{production of}} these documents are discussed.

They are a symbol of control, particularly in the rise of the new, modernist, paradigm in planning thought.

However, the majority of these documents, although influential, were never carried out in this drastic fashion. These images thus represent a microcosm of changing attitudes in architecture, planning, and urban design at a key point in time; and strong links can be drawn to current perspectives on the representation and production of urban space. ...|$|R

40|$|Drawing on {{primary and}} {{secondary}} research, this article assesses the spatial dynamics that underpin high rates of urban violence in Latin America. It argues that both the origins and responses to urban violence in Latin America have involved some sort of state ordering of territory, ranging from <b>modernist</b> <b>urban</b> planning practices {{on the one hand}} to police control over urban spaces on the other. To the extent that efforts to impose social and spatial order in Latin American cities have both derived from and reinforced a history of squatter occupation, ambiguous property rights, and uneven distribution of services, thus producing a stark distinction between the so-called formal and the informal city, they have laid the foundations for urban violence. In what follows, we see how and why government efforts to create spatial and social order have produced this unfortunate state of affairs. The claim is that the assumptions and ideas underlying the imposition of modernist planning priorities and spatial practices in urban Latin America have inadvertently contributed to a set of inter-related spatial, social, economic, and political problems that have driven the cycle of urban violence...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to reveal the modernist production of space in relation to the everyday life of people in Hong Kong. Governments usually consider <b>modernist</b> <b>urban</b> planning to be an active force, and assume that this is the only proper means of directing the community towards the ideal of social harmony. As a result, the everyday life for citizens - ordinary people - in urban regions is embodied within the experience of a highly organised society. This article highlights the significance of this <b>modernist</b> ideology for <b>urban</b> development of Hong Kong. A case study of a district, Wan Chai, is then adopted to illustrate a tendency towards specific urban development strategies, in contrast to the diverse urban fabrics that have developed in a historical context. A comparative approach is used to examine the southern and northern parts of the district (that is, Wan Chai North and Wan Chai South). Six dimensions are used to analyse differentiations between modern urban areas and traditional living areas. The results shed light on planning issues that are relevant to everyday spaces.

It has density and enclosure but also the thrill of open-ended space. Yet when <b>modernist</b> <b>urban</b> theories turned against the vernacular urbanism of New York, and superblocks and towers in the park were imposed on the city, the grid absorbed those inventions. [...] Although New York's real estate dynamism is typically associated with disrespect for history, with buildings toppled {{for the next generation of}} taller ones, the 1811 grid endures as living history.
