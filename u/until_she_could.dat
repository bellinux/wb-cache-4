5|$|In September 2003, the NCAA {{reversed}} {{its decision}} to add a second year of postseason ineligibility after hearing an appeal by the University; the Wolverines {{went on to become}} champions of the 2004 National Invitation Tournament. Also in September 2003, Judge Edmunds deferred sentencing <b>until</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> monitor Webber's service of 300 hours of community service at a middle-school literacy program for two summers that she ordered. Also in September the University announced it sought $695,000 in restitution from Webber. Webber was the only involved athlete that the University sought restitution from in part because {{he was the only one}} who confessed to lying to a grand jury. Webber stated that he did not feel the University's request was appropriate because he had not stolen from the University.|$|E
5|$|Joaquim Inácio {{returned}} to Rio de Janeiro in October, his {{tour of duty}} having lasted three years. He was then sent back to Cisplatina aboard the frigate Niterói and in December {{he became the first}} officer of the barque Grenfell. On 17 February 1828, he fought in the Battle of Quilmes. During the engagement, the Brazilian barque-brig (three-masted barque) Vinte e nove de agosto ran aground and was about to be boarded. Seeing this, Joaquim Inácio positioned the Grenfell near the threatened vessel and protected her <b>until</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be freed by the rising tide. Both ships {{returned to}} the battle, which resulted in a Brazilian victory. Brazil's efforts in the war were ultimately in vain, as it eventually relinquished Cisplatina, which became the independent nation of Uruguay. In July 1829, Joaquim Inácio again returned to Rio de Janeiro, and on 17 October he was promoted to first lieutenant.|$|E
25|$|Ports in the Persian Gulf were {{overwhelmed}} {{by the amount of}} cargo arriving from allied countries, and so John W. Brown was forced to lie at anchor for a month <b>until</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> begin to unload at Abadan, Iran, where she dropped off the two P-40s and some of the tanks in late January 1943. It took another month and a half <b>until</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> enter port at Khorramshahr, Iran, and unload the rest of her cargo in March 1943.|$|E

60|$|Now Muriel Gascoyne had no very keen perceptions, and was, moreover, {{wrapped up}} in her own and Jefferson's affairs, or she might have seen that anger was not all that Jacinta was feeling. As it was, {{overcome}} by the relief the message had brought her, she quite failed to notice {{the pain in her}} companion's face or the quivering of her hands. In a minute or two Jacinta, who waited <b>until</b> <b>she</b> fancied <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do so without it appearing significant, rose and left her.|$|R
25|$|While in high school, Watts fathered a {{daughter}} {{with a white}} woman, causing a scandal. Their families decided against an interracial marriage because of contemporary racial attitudes and Watts' family provided for the child <b>until</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be adopted by Watts' uncle, Wade Watts, a Baptist minister, civil rights leader {{and head of the}} Oklahoma division of the NAACP.|$|E
25|$|Rosenzweig {{suffered}} from the muscular degenerative disease Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease). Towards {{the end of his}} life, he had to write {{with the help of his}} wife, Edith, who would recite letters of the alphabet until he indicated for her to stop, continuing <b>until</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> guess the word or phrase he intended (or, at other times, Rosenzweig would point to the letter on the plate of his typewriter). They also developed a communication system based on him blinking his eyes.|$|E
25|$|Sarah Walker was, {{as some of}} Hazlitt's friends could see, {{a fairly}} {{ordinary}} girl. She had aspirations to better herself, and a famous author seemed like a prize catch, but she never really understood Hazlitt. When another lodger named Tomkins came along, she entered into a romantic entanglement with him as well, leading each of her suitors {{to believe he was}} the sole object of her affection. With vague words, she evaded absolute commitment <b>until</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> decide which she liked better or was the more advantageous catch.|$|E

Her son's wife has left him and taken their eleven-year-old daughter with her to Australia where she has remarried. She now really wants Beggsy to find someone else rather than chasing after his ex-wife, who he obviously still loves. She doesn't interfere exactly, but he is always round at her house even though he doesn't live there.|$|R

25|$|Harry Johnson is {{a wealthy}} American slave-owner of Maryland {{who is also}} active in the new US {{government}} as an intelligence agent and spymaster in Boston during the War of 1812. He is first met in Alipur, India pursuing Diana Villiers in HMS Surprise. He then becomes Diana Villiers' lover, <b>until</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not bear his brutality or expectation that she would aid him in his spy work against Britain in The Fortune of War. Diana became pregnant with his child, but suffered a miscarriage in Surgeon's Mate. Johnson's cultured exterior hides a brutal nature. Diana fled with Maturin in The Fortune of War. Johnson doggedly pursues Maturin across the Atlantic, and identifying betrays Maturin to the French.|$|E
25|$|Her mother, of the House of Hohenzollern, was a {{woman of}} quite distraught {{temperament}} and was melancholic. It is possible she was insane. After the king died on 6November 1632 on the battlefield, his corpse was brought home in a coffin, with his heart in a separate box. Maria Eleonora ordered that the king should not be buried <b>until</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be buried with him. She also demanded that the coffin be kept open, and went to see it regularly, patting it and taking no notice of the putrefaction. Eventually, the embarrassed Chancellor, Axel Oxenstierna, saw no other solution than to have a guard posted at the room to prevent further episodes. As a result, he was not buried until 22June 1634, more than eighteen months later.|$|E
25|$|In 1809 Clyde {{participated in}} the ill-fated Walcheren Campaign. A British force landed on 30 July 1809, and withdrew in December, having {{accomplished}} little and having suffered extensive casualties, primarily from disease. On 13 August Clyde was to the south-west of Flushing, with Owen {{in command of the}} bomb and other vessels bombarding the town. The next day , the flagship of Admiral Sir Richard John Strachan grounded; Clyde came to her assistance <b>until</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be refloated. On 8 December Clyde was at the Woolversdyke protecting the expedition's retreat. Between 23 and 28 December, Owen managed the withdrawal of the British forces from the Scheld. Clyde shared in the prize money for the property the British army captured during the campaign.|$|E
60|$|Mrs Verden {{watched her}} daughter's delirium, {{and all the}} time, {{in a kind of}} mental chant, invoked the help of God. Once or twice the girl came to herself, drew away her hand on {{recognizing}} the situation, and turned from her mother, who patiently waited <b>until,</b> upon relapse, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> soothe her daughter again. Helena was glad of her mother's presence, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not bear to be looked at.|$|R
50|$|Alston's son {{succumbed to}} a fever and died on June 30, 1812, at age ten.

Unable to join him, she had to wait <b>until</b> December before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> make the journey.|$|R
5000|$|In this visible location, {{the innkeeper}} Balthasar Kalkofen built his {{original}} inn, popular with boatmen and wagon drivers, in 1697. This {{part of the}} building, then situated parallel to the Lahn, still exists. The ground floor of the three-floor building is constructed of masonry with massive quarried stone, while the upper stories are of half-timbered construction (Fachwerkbau). The round half-timbered customs tower with a curved roof and the distinctive roof lantern dates from 1741. After the death of Balthasar Kalkofen, his widow Catherine operated the inn alone <b>until</b> 1727. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> have been the [...] "woman hostess" [...] from the song.|$|R
25|$|Negative {{criticism}} of Mann's works {{is not hard}} to find. One of her detractors, Pat Robertson of the Christian Broadcasting Network, has said that “selling photographs of children in their nakedness for profit is an exploitation of the parental role and I think it’s wrong.” He views such work as a violation of the responsibility of parents to do everything in their power to protect, shelter, and nurture their children. More negative criticism came from Raymond Sokolov’s article Critique: Censoring Virginia in the Wall Street Journal. He questioned whether children should be photographed nude and whether federal funds should be appropriated for such artworks. Accompanying his article was a modified image by Mann of her daughter Virginia (Virginia at 4), in which her eyes, nipples, and pubic region were now covered with black bars. Mann said he used the image without permission “to illustrate that {{this is the kind of}} thing that shouldn’t be shown.” She was devastated and insulted that someone could mutilate her photograph that way. Virginia was also upset about the article. She wrote a letter to the author saying “Dear Sir, I don’t like the way you crossed me out.” Mann said that after Virginia saw the article, she started touching herself on the areas that were blacked out, saying, “what’s wrong with me?” It was somewhat difficult for Mann to understand the harsh {{criticism of}} these photographs, for she did not stage these moments — instead when she saw a photo opportunity unfolding, she simply asked her children stop moving <b>until</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> capture it. When Mann was young, she was often nude, so she raised her children similarly.|$|E

Soon after their arrival, Ysabel died, and she {{was buried in the}} same coffin as Ygnacio. [...] Their remains lie at Calvary Cemetery.|$|E
500|$|Carey {{recorded}} a Spanish version of [...] "My All" [...] titled, [...] "Mi Todo." [...] Unlike with [...] "Hero" [...] (1993) and [...] "Open Arms" [...] (1995), Carey recorded the Spanish {{version of the}} song in a different key from the original English version. The first line of the song had been mistranslated and was grammatically incorrect. Carey later mentioned on her website that she would no longer record Spanish versions of her songs <b>until</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> verify the correct lyrics and pronunciation. [...] "Mi Todo" [...] was remixed as well, however only being released as a promotional single in Mexico.|$|E
60|$|As for Loper, Larrabel, Crackaby, Stickler, and Company--feeling that {{it would}} be {{improper}} to remain after the host and hostess were gone; {{that it would}} be equally wrong to offer to go with them, and quite inappropriate to witness the home-coming,--they took themselves off, but each resolved to flutter unseen in the neighbourhood <b>until</b> he, or <b>she,</b> <b>could</b> make quite sure that the prodigal had returned.|$|R
5000|$|Milhouse {{has made}} a career out of getting victimized. In [...] "Sideshow Bob Roberts", the schoolyard bullies wrapped Milhouse in bumper {{stickers}} and placed him in a shopping cart. After Jimbo claimed that [...] "the mummy's ready for his mystical journey!", the bullies pushed the cart with Milhouse down a very steep hill. He is harmed frequently, and on some occasions is injured by dangerous hazards, e.g., being run over by a train, falling down a waterfall, being electrocuted, having his head polished to bone, and having his teeth knocked out by a hockey puck. As a lead character he always survives and recovers, often with no further mention of any injuries. He frequently visited a female psychiatrist <b>until</b> even <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not deal with his constant calling and blocked his number.|$|R

The film premiered in July 2007 to what Entertainment Weekly called [...] "an abysmal $3.5million." [...] It earned Lohan dual Golden Raspberry awards for Worst Actress, with Lohan coming first and second, tying with herself.

500|$|With {{encouragement}} from an acting coach, Ratajkowski met and signed with a talent agent who contacted Ford Models. That same day, she signed with Ford at age 14 {{and went on}} to do teen print catalog modeling for Kohl's and Nordstrom. At 15, Ratajkowski began auditioning for Disney and iCarly roles, but as she pursued acting she was often cast as a [...] "bitchy girl", cheerleader, or other limited role. She attended San Dieguito Academy high school in San Diego, while modeling and acting in Los Angeles. After two nondescript movie roles, she appeared as Gibby's girlfriend, Tasha, in two episodes of the third season of Nickelodeon's iCarly (2009–2010). Her manager discouraged her from pursuing many acting engagements <b>until</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be more selective.|$|E

60|$|Suleiman Ali's {{advice was}} carried out. It added {{considerably}} {{to the length}} of the voyage; but they saw only one doubtful craft. She was lying close inshore under the shadow of the sand hills, and they did not see her <b>until</b> <b>she</b> hoisted her sails and shot out from the land. They were, however, three miles distant from the land at the time, and the wind was blowing from the north; consequently the pirate was dead to leeward. Every sail was set at once on board the trader, and, being a fast sailor, she maintained her position until nightfall. The wind then dropped, and just as the light faded they could see that the vessel behind them had put out her sweeps. The trader kept up her sails <b>until</b> certain that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be no longer seen; then the canvas was lowered, and the crew took to the boats and towed her due north.|$|R
500|$|As Ross {{became the}} focal point of the Supremes, Ballard felt pushed aside in the group. Depression ensued, and Ballard began to drink excessively, gaining weight <b>until</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> no longer comfortably wear many of her stage outfits. The friendship, and later the working relationship, between Ross and Ballard became strained. During this {{turbulent}} period, Ballard relied heavily upon the advice of group mate Mary Wilson, with whom she had maintained a close friendship. Wilson, while outwardly demure and neutral in hopes of keeping the group stable, privately advised Ballard that Ross and Gordy were eager to oust Ballard. Although the Supremes scored two number-one hits during the first quarter of 1967, [...] "Love Is Here and Now You're Gone" [...] and [...] "The Happening", the group as a unit began to disintegrate.|$|E
500|$|With the war over, Blitz was {{deployed}} to the Mediterranean a second time, now {{to represent the}} interests of the newly-formed North German Confederation.

She was joined in this endeavor by the North German steam frigate [...] Blitz made a second trip to Mytilene on 16 March; on the return legs of both voyages, she evacuated refugees to mainland Anatolia. In September 1867, Blitz was sent to the island of Crete, then in the midst of the Cretan Revolt; between two trips that month, she carried more than 500 women and children first to the island of Milos and then to Piraeus. She was thereafter joined by the corvette , the two vessels remaining in Cretan waters until the end of November. Blitz returned to Smyrna, but was sent to Chios on 4 December along with the frigate [...] to assist the French corvette , which had run aground on the island. The Germans helped to lighten Roland <b>until</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be pulled free; for their efforts, the French government awarded the Legion of Honor to Blitzs commander.|$|E

The same day, Saldívar drove to Corpus Christi and checked into the Sand and Sea Motel. Selena was in Miami, Florida, at the time. Quintanilla, Jr. believed {{this would have been}} the first attempt to kill Selena. When Selena arrived in Corpus Christi on March 14, Saldívar contacted her to schedule a meeting. Saldívar told Selena there was too much traffic and asked her to meet her at a parking lot twenty-five miles (40 km) away from Corpus Christi. Upon arriving, Selena told Saldívar she could remain in charge of her business affairs in Mexico. According to Quintanilla, Jr. Selena wanted to continue employing Saldívar <b>until</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> find a replacement. Saldívar showed Selena the gun she had bought; Selena told her to [...] "get rid of it" [...] and said she would protect Saldívar from her father, according to Saldívar and Pérez. This, Quintanilla, Jr. believed, had calmed Saldívar and was the reason she did not kill Selena in the parking lot. The next day, Saldívar returned the gun to the shop saying her father had given her a [...]22-caliber pistol. On March 26, Saldívar stole a perfume sample and more bank statements from Selena in Mexico.|$|E
