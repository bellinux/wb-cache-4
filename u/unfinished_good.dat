5000|$|Under IFRS, {{companies}} need {{to record the}} cost of their Ending Inventory at the lower of cost and NRV, to ensure that their inventory and income statement are not overstated (under ASPE, companies record the lower of cost and market value). For example, under IFRS, at a company's year end, if an <b>unfinished</b> <b>good</b> that already cost $25 is expected to sell for $100 to a customer, but it will take an additional $20 to complete and $10 to advertise to the customer, its NRV will be $100-$20-$10=$70. In this year's income statement, since the cost of the good ($25) is less than its NRV ($70), the cost of the good will get recorded as the cost of inventory. In next year's income statement after the good was sold, this company will record a revenue of $100, Cost of Goods Sold of $25, and Cost of Completion and Disposal of $20+$10=$30. This leads to a profit of $100-$25-$30=$45 on this transaction. Suppose we changed the example so that it costs $60 to advertise to the customer. Now the good's NRV will be $100-$20-$60=$20. In this year's income statement, since the NRV ($20) is less than the cost of the good ($25), the NRV will get recorded as the Cost of Ending Inventory. To do so, an inventory write down of $25-$20=$5 is done, and hence a decrease of $5 in this year's income statement. In the next year's income statement after the good was sold, this company will record a revenue of $100, Cost of Goods Sold of $20, and Cost of Completion and Disposal of $20+$60=$80. This leads to the company breaking even on this transaction ($100-$20-$80=$0).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a {{possible}} approach for supply systems modeled using queueing networks. According to Poisson processes, unfinished goods and control impulses arrive at the working stations, namely the nodes of the network. When the working process in a node ends, a good moves to another node with fixed probabilities either as a part to process or as a control impulse, or leaves the network. Each control impulse is activated during a random exponentially distributed time. According to some probabilities, activated impulses move an <b>unfinished</b> <b>good</b> from the node they arrive to another node, or destroy another unfinished part. For such a queueing network, a product form solution is found for the stationary state probabilities. The stability of the network, the stationary probabilities and {{the mean number of}} unfinished parts are studied via an algorithm. Such results are also useful to analyze a real system for assembling car parts...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{offshoring}} decision of firms whose production process {{is characterized by}} a particular sequence of steps. International cost differences vary non-monotonically along the production chain, and moving <b>unfinished</b> <b>goods</b> across borders incurs transport costs. We show that, in such a setting, firms may refrain from offshoring even if relocating individual steps would be advantageous in terms of offshoring costs, or they may offshore (almost) the entire production chain to save transport costs. Small variations in model parameters may thus have a substantial impact on offshoring activities. ...|$|R

We specify the production of manufactures such {{that a variety of}} producer services is needed to transform tradable <b>unfinished</b> <b>goods</b> into final consumption goods. We find that service linkages promote the concentration of economic activity in a single region, but whether full concentration is achieved depends on the costs and mode of services trade. Applying the model to a multiregion world shows that incorporating producer services may also give rise to regions that specialize in different economic activities...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{contributions}} on offshoring often {{assume that}} firms can freely split their production process into separate steps {{which can be}} ranked according to the cost savings from producing abroad.

40|$|Abstract: Considering {{material}} flow and production systems, {{there is a}} limited space close to a machine {{or a group of}} machines for buffering <b>unfinished</b> <b>goods.</b> Therefore, for the dimensioning of {{material flow}} buffers it is of vital importance to analyze the number of customers in the queue at the arrival instant. It is crucial that there is enough free buffer capacity to receive the arriving customers. In our paper we consider a G/G/ 1 -queueing system with batch arrivals in the discrete time domain. On the basis of the waiting time distribution we present an analytical approach for the calculation of the number of customers at the arrival instant. Given a confidence level the required buffer capacity can be calculated...|$|R
40|$|Growing {{shares of}} {{international}} trade flows consist of intermediate and <b>unfinished</b> <b>goods</b> shipped {{from one country to}} another to combine manufacturing or services activities at home with those performed abroad. This configuration of the productive structure has been named “internationally fragmented. ” The purpose of our work is to analyze the labor market effects of international fragmentation of production, looking at how it affects relative labor demand. Models of trade due to fragmentation of production suggest that when international fragmentation takes place we might observe a change in the factor proportion in the affected industries. We use outward-processing-trade data - specifically related to international fragmentation of production - to test if the shift in the ratio of skilled and unskilled labor employed in Italy and Germany during the 1990 s is related to fragmentation. ...|$|R
40|$|Trade in {{merchandise}} and <b>unfinished</b> <b>goods</b> increases {{faster than the}} world’s GDP, {{and so does the}} demand for maritime transport services. These services form part of the global logistics chain that determine a good’s competitiveness. At the same time, the maritime business is itself strongly affected by globalisa-tion. Trade in maritime services {{is one of the most}} liberalised industries, and its “components”, such as vessels, flag registration, class inspections, insurance and the work of seafarers, are purchased globally. As mainstream economists attempt to tackle the causes and impacts of glob-alisation, international transport is re-entering the debate on trade models and development theories. This chapter attempts to contribute to this debate. It analyses the mutual relationships between trade and its maritime transport, including the specialisation of countries in different shipping sectors, the deter-minants of transport costs and their relation to trade volumes, and the exter-nalities of growing trade and maritime transport...|$|R

[...] It was {{the members of the}} patrician class that dominated the prestigious and well paid positions of decision making concerning the Monte di Pietà.Since the purpose of the Monte di Pietà was to combat usury, there were clear guidelines regarding the operations of the organization. For example, the employees had to ensure that all items that were exchanged were free, and therefore the legal property of the person pawning it. Also there were guidelines regarding the kind of items that were permitted, and the amount a person could borrow, both in terms of time and quantity. For example, holy items and <b>unfinished</b> <b>goods</b> such as pieces of cloth were not accepted as pawns for loans.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} theory of the global {{production}} process that focuses on tradeable tasks, {{and use it to}} study how falling costs of offshoring affect factor prices in the source country. We identify a productivity effect of task trade that benefits the factor whose tasks are more easily moved offshore. In the light of this effect, reductions in the cost of trading tasks can generate shared gains for all domestic factors, in contrast to the distributional conflict that typically results from reductions in the cost of trading goods. (JEL F 11, F 16) The nature of international trade is changing. For centuries, trade mostly entailed an exchange of goods. Now it increasingly involves bits of value being added in many different locations, or what might be called trade in tasks. Revolutionary advances in transportation and communications technology have weakened the link between labor specialization and geographic concentration, making it increasingly viable to separate tasks in time and space. When instructions can be delivered instantaneously, components and <b>unfinished</b> <b>goods</b> can be moved quickly and cheaply, and the output of many tasks can be conveyed electronically, firms can take advantage of factor cost disparities in different countries without sacrificing the gains from specialization.

40|$|In {{traditional}} trade models, whether {{based on}} technological differences or on relative factor endowments, merchandise composition and directions of trade {{are derived from}} closed-economy conditions. But nowadays {{one of the basic}} assumptions of traditional trade models, i. e. that production processes are integrated within just one country, is being increasingly violated as previously integrated productive activities are segmented and spread over an international network of production sites: as a result, an increasingly large share of trade flows is made up of intermediate and <b>unfinished</b> <b>goods</b> being transferred from one country to another in order to be processed. In this paper we submit that such new configuration of production processes has important effects on at least three dimensions of economic research. First, we show that international disintegration of production processes leads to a lessening of the power of comparative advantages when it comes to explaining both merchandise composition and directions of trade, while it is the concept of absolute advantage to become increasingly relevant; second, we show that empirical measures of revealed comparative advantages are inherently misleading if they do not account for differences in the stage-of-processing of traded goods; third, we estimate a simple model of aggregate demand accounting for international trade in intermediates: results of estimation lend support to our prior that participation of a country in the process of international fragmentation of production plays a specific and significant role in determining its year-over-year change in GDP.

The result has been a boom in “offshoring ” of both manufacturing tasks and other business functions. 1 In this paper, we develop a simple and tractable model of offshoring based on the trade-able tasks. We conceptualize production in terms of the many tasks that must be performed by each factor of production. A firm can perform each of the continuum of tasks required for the realization of its product either in close proximity to its headquarters or at an offshore location. Offshoring may be attractive, if some factors can be hired more cheaply abroad than at home, but it also is costly, because remote performance of a task limits the opportunities for monitoring and coordinating workers. 2 To capture this aspect of reality, our model features heterogeneous offshoring costs for the various tasks. In each industry, firms choose the geographic organizatio...|$|R
