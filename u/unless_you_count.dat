In the {{critical}} review entitled [...] "Weep over this princely pile of slush", Mark Schilling criticized the film as [...] "a weeper that ... left me surprisingly dry eyed" [...] and added that [...] "There's hardly a spark of originality in the entire enterprise, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>count</b> the casting of Tadanobu Asano – the coolest Japanese actor of his generation – as a sad-but-wise circus clown." [...] Reviewer Matiko Wataru of the [...] "Eiga-Judge" [...] website said that [...] "this innocent and sad tale tragedy of the boy is too simplistic and the screenplay did not do much.". However, the review praised the [...] "beautiful scenery {{of the city of}} Shonai" [...] and said the film was a [...] "sad and beautiful combination of children and animals".|$|E

[...] Luis Tovar of Pretty Much Amazing compared the video to the trailer of The Dark Knight Rises, and called it [...] "totally Kanye". Popdust writer Katherine St Asaph described the video as an artistic [...] "black-and-white cut that disorients you with lots of falling and flailing and flailing-called-interpretive-dance, with billowing smoke and sudden shifts in art direction", commenting that the video was a welcome change of pace.|$|E

50|$|The {{history of}} The Berzerkers {{goes back to}} the late 1980s. These were the days before there was a real {{hardcore}} scene on Long Island. There were only a few crews scattered around in different towns across the island. There weren’t any venues back then that would even have shows <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> want to <b>count</b> Sundance—a club that was located in Bay Shore. Most kids from the island would have to get on the train to get to the CBGB’s hardcore matinees. Back then even admitting you were from Long Island was a potential dangerous situation. Kids would risk life and limb just to travel to the city to see their favorite bands perform in a club that catered to a scene that was becoming increasingly violent.|$|R

Dramatically, there should have been {{cautious}} sparring for openings and a number of tensely contested rounds, {{as if it had been}} the final of a boxing competition. But school fights, when they do occur--which is only once in a decade nowadays, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>count</b> junior school scuffles--are the outcome of weeks of suppressed bad blood, and are consequently brief and furious. In a boxing competition, however much one may want to win, one does not dislike one's opponent. Up to the moment when [...] "time" [...] was called, one was probably warmly attached to him, and at the end of the last round one expects to resume that attitude of mind. In a fight each party, as a rule, hates the other.|$|E
60|$|However, let me not deceive any one. My Itinerary lacks a detail. I {{must put}} it in. The truth is, {{that after the}} pilgrim has {{faithfully}} followed {{the requirements of the}} Itinerary through to the end and has secured his salvation and also the personal knowledge of that fact, there is still an accident possible to him which can annul the whole thing. If he should ever cross {{to the other side of}} the Ganges and get caught out and die there he would at once come to life again in the form of an ass. Think of that, after all this trouble and expense. You see how capricious and uncertain salvation is there. The Hindoo has a childish and unreasoning aversion to being turned into an ass. It is hard to tell why. One could properly expect an ass to have an aversion to being turned into a Hindoo. One could understand that he could lose dignity by it; also self-respect, and nine-tenths of his intelligence. But the Hindoo changed into an ass wouldn't lose anything, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>count</b> his religion. And he would gain much--release from his slavery to two million gods and twenty million priests, fakeers, holy mendicants, and other sacred bacilli; he would escape the Hindoo hell; he would also escape the Hindoo heaven. These are advantages which the Hindoo ought to consider; then he would go over and die on the other side.|$|E
6000|$|... 5. The {{greatness of}} the soul is {{manifest}} by the greatness of the price that Christ paid for it, {{to make it an}} heir of glory; and that was His precious blood (1 Cor 6:20; 1 Peter 1:18,19). We do use to esteem of things according to the price that is given for them, especially when we are convinced that the purchase has not been made by the estimation of a fool. Now the soul is purchased by a price that the Son, the wisdom of God, thought fit to pay for the redemption thereof--what a thing, then, is the soul? Judge {{of the soul}} by the price that is paid for it, and you must needs confess, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>count</b> the blood that hath bought it an unholy thing, that it cannot but be of great worth and value. Suppose a prince, or some great man, should, on a sudden, descend from his throne, or chair of state, to take up, that he might put in his bosom, something that he had espied lying trampled under the feet of those that stand by; would you think that he would do this for an old horse shoe,11 or for so trivial a thing as a pin or a point? 12 Nay, would you not even of yourselves conclude that that thing for which the prince, so great a man, should make such a stoop, must needs be a thing of very great worth? Why, this is the case of Christ and the soul. Christ is the prince, His throne was in heaven, and, as He sat there, He espied the souls of sinners trampled under the foot of the law and death for sin. Now, what doth He, but comes down from His throne, stoops down to the earth, and there, since He could not have the trodden-down souls without price, He lays down His life and blood for them (2 Cor 8:9). But would He have done this for inconsiderable things? No, nor for the souls of sinners neither, had He not valued them higher than he valued heaven and earth besides. 13 This, therefore, is another thing by which the greatness of the soul is known.|$|E
