(Inter-Celestial Light Commune), which lasted from 1994 to 1996. The group featured New York City bassist John Carco (formerly of Queens hardcore group Misguided) who befriended Dee Dee when the two attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings together during the summer of 1992. After writing more than a dozen songs and recording several demos for an upcoming Ramones album with producer Daniel Rey, Dee Dee decided to keep the material for his new band. After working with several drummers and playing several live shows in the New York City area, Dee Dee and Carco moved to Amsterdam to record a four-song EP and fourteen-track album for Rough Trade Records. I Hate Freaks Like You was released on April 17, 1994, featuring Nina Hagen on two of the album's fourteen tracks. The three-piece line <b>up</b> <b>now</b> consisted of Dee Dee (vocals, guitar), Carco (bass, vocals), and Dutch drummer Danny Arnold Lommen.|$|E

[...] (When Rolling Stone updated their list in 2010, the song dropped to No.413.) In 1999, Britain's Poet Laureate, Andrew Motion, chose it as his candidate for the best song lyric ever written. Motion praised [...] "the concentration and surprise" [...] of Dylan's lyrics, and said that, although he distanced himself from some of the singer's views about women, the [...] "rasp of his anger" [...] was a part of his greatness. The International Observer named the song the second best ever recorded in 2017, stating, [...] "The 24 year old Dylan was beginning to realize that no matter how many perfect songs he wrote he could not achieve immortality through his art as he perhaps once believed, because even if people were still listening to the music in 500 years, he would still be dead." [...] Commenting on the song in a 1985 interview, Dylan said, [...] "I still sing that song every once in a while. It still stands <b>up</b> <b>now</b> as it did then, maybe even more in some kind of weird way." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, Peng {{developed}} a personal dislike for Mao's {{efforts to promote}} his own image in Chinese popular culture as a perfect, infallible hero singularly responsible for the Communist victories of his time. In 1955–56 Peng {{was involved in a}} large number of efforts to moderate Mao's popular image, developing into a personal campaign. Peng's preference for modesty and simplicity led Peng to oppose Mao's efforts to develop his personality cult. In 1955 a draft copy of a book, The Military History of the PVA, was submitted to Peng so that he could edit and authorize it. In the preface of the book it was stated that [...] "the military victories of the PVA" [...] were won [...] "under the correct leadership of the CCP and of Comrade Mao Zedong": Peng authorized the text after removing the phrase [...] "and of Comrade Mao Zedong". In 1956 an anonymous Chinese citizen wrote a letter to Peng condemning the practices of hanging portraits of Mao in public places and singing songs in praise of Mao: Peng sent this letter to Huang Kecheng, his chief of staff, to be widely distributed. Peng successfully opposed efforts to place a bronze statue of Mao in the Beijing Military Museum, saying: [...] "why take the trouble to put it up? What is put <b>up</b> <b>now</b> will be removed in the future." [...] When greeted by a group of soldiers who shouted [...] "Long Live Chairman Mao!" [...] (literally [...] "10,000 years for Chairman Mao"), Peng addressed the soldiers, saying: [...] "You shout '10,000 years for Chairman Mao!' – does he, then, live for 10,000 years? He will not even live for 100 years! This is a personality cult!" [...] When one of Peng's political commissars suggested to him that the song The East is Red (a song that idealizes Mao, which Mao later had sung in place of the Chinese national anthem during the Cultural Revolution) be widely taught throughout the PLA, Peng angrily rejected the suggestion, saying [...] "That is a personality cult! That is idealism!" [...] Later in 1956 a group of soldiers visited Peng in order to request an audience with the Chairman, but Peng rejected them, saying: [...] "He is an old man, what is so beautiful about him?" ...|$|E
