25|$|The energy {{efficiency}} {{of a system}} or device that converts energy {{is measured by the}} ratio of the amount of useful energy put out by the system ("output energy") to the total amount of energy that is put in ("input energy") or by <b>useful</b> <b>output</b> <b>energy</b> {{as a percentage of the}} total input energy. In the case of fuel cells, <b>useful</b> <b>output</b> <b>energy</b> is measured in electrical energy produced by the system. Input energy is the energy stored in the fuel. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, fuel cells are generally between 40–60% energy efficient. This is higher than some other systems for energy generation. For example, the typical internal combustion engine of a car is about 25% energy efficient. In combined heat and power (CHP) systems, the heat produced by the fuel cell is captured and put to use, increasing the efficiency of the system to up to 85–90%.|$|E
40|$|International audienceTo {{ensure the}} {{autonomy}} of various sensors, a promising alternative to batteries is to scavenge mechanical ambient energy. In many applications, such as e-textiles, boat sails, shock absorbers or door hinges, the transducers must be deformable, adaptable and modular, i. e. a transducer made of dielectric polymers. Indeed, these polymers are economical, light, flexible and resistant. They have a fast response time, are efficient and deform significantly. Nevertheless, there are passive materials requiring the realization of energetic cycles to convert mechanical energy into electrical. Cycles at constant charge or constant voltage must be realized and an exterior high poling voltage (kV) is needed. Thus, the improvement of dielectric generator will requires the development of performing power management {{as well as the}} improvement of the dielectric polymers. Here, we present a new design of scavenger using electrets for poling the dielectric polymer which is a first step toward a fully autonomous system. Our scavenger is composed of commercial dielectric polymer (3 M VHB 4910) with patterned Teflon electrets developing a potential of - 300 V, and patterned grease electrodes. This solution is analytically modelled and simulated. The performances are compared with those obtained with a constant charge cycle. The power management of all these structures are explained and compared in term of efficiency and <b>useful</b> <b>output</b> <b>energy.</b> Fabrication of the new scavengers is under development...|$|E

40|$|Human {{society is}} now at the {{beginning}} of a transition from fossil-fuel based primary energy sources to a mixture of renewable and nuclear based energy sources which have a lower Energy Return On Energy Invested (EROEI) than the older fossil based sources. This paper examines the evolution of total energy demand during this transition for a highly idealized energy economy. A simple model is introduced in which the net <b>useful</b> <b>energy</b> <b>output</b> required to operate an economy is assumed to remain fixed while the lower EROEI source gradually replaces the older higher EROEI primary energy source following a logistics substitution model. The results show that, for fixed net <b>useful</b> <b>energy</b> <b>output,</b> total <b>energy</b> demand increases as the ratio EROEI new /EROEI old decreases; total energy demand diverges as EROEI new approaches unity, indicating that the system must collapse in this limit.

5000|$|The annual fuel {{utilization}} efficiency (AFUE; pronounced 'A'-'Few' or 'A'-'F'-'U'-'E') is {{a thermal}} efficiency measure of combustion equipment like furnaces, boilers, and water heaters. The AFUE {{differs from the}} true 'thermal efficiency' {{in that it is}} not a steady-state, peak measure of conversion efficiency, but instead attempts to represent the actual, season-long, average efficiency of that piece of equipment, including the operating transients. [...] It is a dimensionless ratio of <b>useful</b> <b>energy</b> <b>output</b> to <b>energy</b> input, expressed as a percentage. For example, a 90% AFUE for a gas furnace means it outputs 90 BTUs of useful heating for every 100 BTUs of natural gas input (where the rest may be wasted heat in the exhaust). A higher AFUE means higher efficiency.|$|R
40|$|Summary The {{principal}} {{incentive for}} adopting energy efficiency measures is financial. Calculations of energy savings are {{complicated by the}} interactions between measures, and their cost effectiveness depends {{on the price of}} energy and therefore on the assumed energy source. This paper outlines a plan of work which, by taking account of these factors, minimises abortive work. The plan is illustrated by its application to the Wansbeck District General Hospital, in Northumberland, which is being designed to save nearly 60 % of the normal delivered energy consumption. 1 Energy efficiency In engineering language, we are used to the term ’efficiency’ expressing a ratio of <b>useful</b> <b>energy</b> <b>output</b> to total <b>energy</b> input. The ratio is always less than unity but designers of, for instance, electric motors strive to approach it as closely as is economically possible. In a building there is no measure of <b>useful</b> <b>energy</b> <b>output</b> to compare with total energy input, so building energ...|$|R

Calorimetric meas urements of the plates at different temperature levels were carried out with simultaneous recording of meteorological data. Comprehensive data were collected in respect of black- painted absorber plates {{as well as those}} with selective coating. It has been demonstrated that the stagnation temperature of an absorber plate, which is yielded under no-flow conditions, is a suitable parameter for calculating the <b>useful</b> <b>energy</b> <b>output</b> by simulation.

5000|$|However, it was {{realised}} {{that the}} term [...] "energy output" [...] refers to both the <b>useful</b> <b>energy</b> <b>output</b> and the non-useful <b>energy</b> <b>output.</b> (Note: that as given by P.K.Nag, an alternative name for 'useful energy' is 'availability' or exergy, and an alternative name for 'non-useful energy' is 'unavailability', or anergy (Nag 1984, p. 156)). But as E.Sciubba and S.Ulgiati observed, the notion of transformity meant to capture the emergy invested per unit product, or <b>useful</b> <b>output.</b> The concept of Transformity was therefore further specified as the ratio of [...] "input emergy dissipated (availability used up)" [...] to the [...] "unit output exergy" [...] (Sciubba and Ulgiati 2005, p. 1957).

40|$|Many modern waste {{treatment}} processes and waste management systems {{are able to}} treat {{many different types of}} waste at the same time, and deliver a number of <b>useful</b> <b>outputs</b> (secondary materials, <b>energy)</b> as well. These systems are thus increasingly multi-functional. As such, in life cycle assessment studies, they create problems related to multi-functionality and allocation. Especially in LCAs of waste management systems, the solution in the form of system expansion or avoided burdens approach dominates the practice, and the partitioning approach plays a minor role. In this paper, we analyse the logic and problems of these two approaches. It appears that for the avoided burdens approach, the number of 'what-if' assumptions is so large that LCAs on the same topic lead to quite diverging results. Since 'what-if' questions cannot be answered in an unambiguous way, such questions should preferably be left outside of a primarily scientific tool. The partitioning approach is not free from arbitrary choices as well, but, in contrast to the 'what-if' approaches, it does not claim to predict what happens or what would have happened...|$|R
40|$|Industrial assets or {{fixed capital}} stocks {{are at the}} core of the {{transition}} to a low-carbon economy. They represent substantial accumulations of capital, bulk materials, and critical metals. Their lifetime determines the potential for material recycling and how fast they can be replaced by new, more efficient facilities. Their efficiency determines the coupling between <b>useful</b> <b>output</b> and <b>energy</b> and material throughput. A sound understanding of the economic and physical properties of fixed capital stocks is essential to anticipating the long-term environmental and economic consequences of the new energy future. We identify substantial overlap in the way stocks are modeled in national accounting, dynamic material flow analysis, dynamic input-output (I/O) analysis, and life cycle assessment (LCA) and we merge these concepts into a common framework for modeling fixed capital stocks. We demonstrate the usefulness of the framework for simultaneous accounting of capital and material stocks and for consequential LCA. We apply the framework to design a demand-driven dynamic I/O model with dynamic capital stocks, and we synthesize both the marginal and attributional matrix of technical coefficients (A-matrix) from detailed process inventories of fixed assets of different age cohorts and technologies. The stock modeling framework allows researchers to identify and exploit synergies between different model families under the umbrella of socioeconomic metabolism.

In fact, a well-projected trigeneration plant can achieve better results than cogenerative one.

A primary objective {{of this research is}} to improve the efficiency of airfoil to obtain higher ratio of <b>useful</b> work <b>output</b> to <b>energy</b> input, thereby saving significant energy resources. This is achieved because bicambered surface airfoil produce greater lift and reduced drag at normal operating angle of attack. A bicamber surface airfoil improved ability to retain an attached boundary layer allows a lower thickness to chord profile to give performance comparable to thicker,single cambered surface airfoil. The above capabilities provide extensive possibilities in design of high altitude aircraft where lift coefficient is low due to thin air. Flow over a short radius object must be at a greater velocity than flow over a long radius object. There for bicambered surface airfoil effectively lower local Reynolds number is respect to boundary layer development. This stable high angle of attack airfoil is improving aviation safety.
