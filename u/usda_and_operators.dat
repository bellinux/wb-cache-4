30|$|Federal fire {{policy has}} changed over time since the initial {{reintroduction}} of wildland fire as a management tool in the early 1970 s. For example, following the summer of 1988 when more than 4850 km 2 burned in and around Yellowstone National Park, fire policy reaffirmed the basic objectives of federal fire management program but emphasized greater training, research, <b>and</b> interagency planning (<b>USDA</b> <b>and</b> USDI 1988). Similarly, following severe fires and multiple fatalities in the 1994 fire season, a joint commission of federal agencies created a revised policy for federal agencies with burnable acreage and reviewed and reaffirmed this policy in 1995 <b>and</b> 2001, respectively (<b>USDA</b> <b>and</b> USDI 1995, 2001). In 2009, this joint commission issued implementation guidance, which included nine guiding principles and 17 policy areas that cover issues from firefighter safety and communication {{to the use of}} wildland fire as a management tool (<b>USDA</b> <b>and</b> USDI 2009). The most recent guidance provides managers with the additional flexibility to manage wildfires for multiple objectives using a wide array of strategic and tactical options. This may include the concurrent use of protection and resource objectives on different parts of a fire perimeter to simultaneously prevent fire damage and promote resource benefits, respectively, if conditions are conducive to achieving these objectives. This updated policy guidance encourages cross-jurisdictional objectives at a landscape scale and greater interagency collaboration (<b>USDA</b> <b>and</b> USDI 2009).|$|R
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Most <b>USDA</b> <b>and</b> Interior agencies did not have readily available information on attorney fee claims and payments made under EAJA and other fee-shifting statutes for fiscal years 2000 through 2010. As a result, {{there was no way}} to readily determine who made claims, the total amount each department paid or awarded in attorney fees, who received the payments, or the statutes under which the cases were brought for the claims over the 11 -year period. Both <b>USDA</b> <b>and</b> Interior officials stated that given the decentralized nature of their departments and the absence of an external requirement to track or report on attorney fee information, decisions such as whether to track attorney fee data and the manner in which to do so are best handled at the agency level. Specifically, officials from 65 of the 75 <b>USDA</b> <b>and</b> Interior agencies we contacted told us that they did not track or could not readily provide us with this information. The remaining 10 <b>USDA</b> <b>and</b> Interior agencies either had mechanisms to track information on attorney fees or were able to compile this information manually using hard copy files or directed us to publicly available information sources where we could obtain the information. However, the extent to which these agencies had attorney fee information available for the 11 -year period varied. Given this difference among these 10 agencies as well as various limitationssuch as 5 <b>USDA</b> <b>and</b> Interior agencies not maintaining data about claims for attorney fees that were filed but deniedit is difficult to comprehensively determine the total number of claims filed for attorney fees, who received payments, in what amounts, and under what statutes. ...|$|R

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Veterinarians play {{an essential role in}} the defense against animal diseases, some of which can have serious repercussions for the health of animals, humans, and the economy. More than half of the federal veterinarians work in the Departments of Agriculture (<b>USDA)</b> <b>and</b> Health and Human Services (HHS). However, there is a growing national shortage of veterinarians. This testimony focuses primarily on two key points as addressed in GAO's recently released report, Veterinarian Workforce: Actions Are Needed to Ensure Sufficient Capacity for Protecting Public and Animal Health (GAO- 09 - 178, February 4, 2009). First, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has not conducted a governmentwide effort to address current and future shortages of federal veterinarians; <b>and,</b> second, <b>USDA</b> <b>and</b> HHS have not assessed the sufficiency of their veterinarian workforces departmentwide. For the report, GAO, among other things, surveyed 24 federal component agencies about their veterinarian workforces. GAO also determined {{the extent to which the}} departments that employ about 96 percent of federal veterinarians, including <b>USDA</b> <b>and</b> HHS, have assessed the sufficiency of their veterinarian workforce.
