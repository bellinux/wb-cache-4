50|$|Animal {{and human}} {{studies have found}} that the {{stimulation}} of FP receptors located on Ciliary muscle and trabecular meshwork cells of the eye widens the drainage channels (termed the uveoscleral pathway) that they form. This increases the outflow of aqueous humor from the anterior chamber of the eye through Schlemm's canal to outside of the eyeball. The increase in aqueous humor outflow triggered by FP receptor activation reduces Intraocular pressure and underlies the widespread usage of FP receptor agonists to treat glaucoma. László Z. Bitó is credited with making critical studies to define this intraocular pressure-relieving pathway. Three FP receptor agonists are approved for clinical use in the USA viz., travoprost, latanoprost, and bimatoprost, and two additional agonists are prescribed in Europe and Asia viz., <b>unoprostone</b> and tafluprost.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} study the relationship between intracellular Ca 2 + and activation of large conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+ (BK) currents by <b>unoprostone,</b> the first synthetic docosanoid. We used HEK 293 cells stably transfected with two BK channel splice variants, one sensitive to <b>unoprostone</b> and the other insensitive. We {{examined the effects of}} <b>unoprostone</b> on channel activity in excised inside–out patches and cell-attached patches. The half-maximal stimulation of the sensitive BK channels by Ca 2 + was shifted from 3. 4 ± 0. 017 nM to 0. 81 ±. 0058 nM in the presence of 10 nM <b>unoprostone.</b> There was no effect on insensitive channels even at <b>unoprostone</b> concentrations as high as 1000 nM. There was no effect of <b>unoprostone</b> on the voltage dependence of the BK channels. Changes in open probability and effects of Ca 2 + and <b>unoprostone</b> were best described by a synergistic binding model. These data would suggest that Ca 2 + and <b>unoprostone</b> were binding to sites close to one another on the channel protein and that <b>unoprostone</b> binding causes the affinity of the calcium binding site to increase. This idea is consistent with three dimensional models of the Ca 2 + binding site and a putative <b>unoprostone</b> binding domain. Our results have important implications for the clinical use of <b>unoprostone</b> to activate BK channels. Channel activation will be limited if intracellular Ca 2 + is not elevated...|$|E

With <b>unoprostone</b> monotherapy, most adverse events were mild or moderate and transient in nature. Less than 7 % of unoprostone-treated patients discontinued therapy due to an adverse event. the most common adverse events associated with <b>unoprostone</b> were burning/stinging, burning/stinging directly upon drug instillation, ocular itching, and conjunctival hyperaemia. <b>Unoprostone</b> had no clinically notable effects on vital signs, laboratory profiles, or comprehensive ophthalmic examinations. One of 659 <b>unoprostone</b> 0. 15 %-treated patients had a change in iris colour after 12 months of monotherapy. Except for {{a higher incidence of}} burning/stinging and burning/stinging upon instillation, <b>unoprostone</b> was comparable to timolol 0. 5 % twice daily and betaxolol 0. 5 % twice daily. No safety concerns were raised with use of <b>unoprostone</b> as adjunctive therapy. <b>Unoprostone</b> had no significant effect on exercise-induced heart rate in healthy subjects or on pulmonary function in patients with mild-to-moderate asthma. the safety profile of <b>unoprostone</b> 0. 15 % was consistent with published information on the 0. 12 % formulation. in conclusion, <b>unoprostone</b> has an excellent safety profile in patients with POAG or OH.

40|$|Derrick S Fung, Jess T WhitsonDepartment of Ophthalmology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USAAbstract: Glaucoma is a progressive, {{neurodegenerative}} {{optic nerve}} disease {{that can cause}} significant visual morbidity and affects over 60 million people worldwide. The only known modifiable risk factor for glaucoma at this time is elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), which may be treated with medications, laser therapy, and/or incisional surgery. Topical ocular medications are commonly used as first-line therapy for glaucoma, although side effects may limit their use. <b>Unoprostone</b> is a novel 22 -carbon ocular hypotensive agent that may be advantageous in treating some patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Unlike the 20 -carbon prostanoids, such as latanoprost, that lower IOP primarily through an increase in uveoscleral outflow, <b>unoprostone</b> may lower IOP through increased aqueous outflow via the conventional trabecular meshwork pathway. Although not as efficacious as other prostanoids, <b>unoprostone</b> is effective for IOP reduction both as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy with timolol. <b>Unoprostone</b> has decreased affinity for the prostaglandin F 2 α receptor, which may explain its well tolerated ocular and systemic side effect profile compared with other prostanoids.

We compared the drugs {{in terms of their}} effects on intraocular pressure (IOP) and visual field loss progression over a 3 -year period. Study design: Prospective, randomized controlled study. Methods: We enrolled 48 patients with newly diagnosed NTG at Kanazawa University Hospital. Eligible patients were randomly allocated (1 : 1) to receive either <b>unoprostone</b> or latanoprost ophthalmic solutions. The primary outcomes were IOP changes and visual field deterioration within 36 months. Visual field changes were analyzed: the cumulative survival rates were calculated in terms of mean deviation, pattern standard deviation, and total deviation of the upper or lower hemi-visual field, each visual field sector, and guided progression analysis. In addition, we evaluated the progression of glaucomatous optic disc changes using fundus photography and confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy. Results: The mean pretreatment IOP was 15. 0 ± 2. 4 mmHg in the <b>Unoprostone</b> group and 15. 2 ± 1. 9 mmHg in the Latanoprost group. The mean IOP during the treatment period was 13. 7 ± 2. 3 mmHg in the <b>Unoprostone</b> group and 13. 0 ± 1. 8 mmHg in the Latanoprost group. In both groups, the IOP decreased significantly (p< 0. 001) from baseline after treatment. The posttreatment IOP values were significantly lower in the Latanoprost group than in the <b>Unoprostone</b> group (p= 0. 023). Regarding the 3 -year cumulative survival rate of visual field loss progression, {{there were no significant differences}} between groups in any parameters of the visual field or guided progression analysis. There were no significant differences between groups in disc changes. Conclusions: No significant differences were found between groups with regard to the visual field and structural progression in patients with NTG, although <b>unoprostone</b> was less effective than latanoprost in lowering the IOP.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{identify}} and localize {{the expression of}} multispecific organic anion transporting polypeptides (Oatps/OATPs) in the ciliary body epithelium and to investigate their possible involvement in the transport of the antiglaucoma agent <b>unoprostone.</b> METHODS: Oatps/OATPs were detected by immunoblot analysis and by immunofluorescence microscopy in homogenized and fixed rat and human ciliary body samples using specific polyclonal antibodies. Transport of 3 H-labelled <b>unoprostone</b> was measured in Oatp/OATP expressing Xenopus laevis oocytes. RESULTS: Immunoblots of ciliary body extracts were positive for rat Oatp 1 a 4, Oatp 1 a 5 and Oatp 1 b 2 and for human OATP 1 A 2, OATP 1 C 1, OATP 2 B 1, OATP 3 A 1 and OATP 4 A 1. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy localized Oatp 1 a 4 and Oatp 1 b 2 {{as well as all}} immunoblot positive human OATPs at the basolateral plasma membrane of the non-pigmented rat and human ciliary body epithelium, respectively. However, for human OATPs additional regional differences in expression were found with OATP 1 A 2 and OATP 1 C 1 being expressed only in the pars plana of human ciliary body epithelium. Furthermore, OATP 1 C 1, OATP 3 A 1 and OATP 4 A 1 were also expressed at the basolateral plasma membrane of the pars plana pigmented epithelium.

The mean follow-up time was at least 1 year. Rescula achieved a significant (p = 0. 00001) and long-lasting reduction in IOP (from 20. 78 ± 2. 71 to 17. 14 ± 2. 70 mmHg) in patients with open-angle glaucoma after 12 months of follow-up.

40|$|PURPOSE: Almost {{five years}} have elapsed since the {{introduction}} of latanoprost on several markets and considering {{the large number of}} publications dealing with it, the authors felt that it was worth re-evaluating the drug. METHODS: The criterion used to select trials for inclusion in the review was: all articles mentioning the drug in common electronic data-bases; these were then screened and considered, on the basis of methodological quality. RESULTS: Experimental data suggest that latanoprost acts by remodeling the extracellular matrix in the ciliary muscle, thus increasing the flow of aqueous humor through the ciliary muscle bundles of the uveoscleral pathway. POAG: Latanoprost persistently improves the pulsatile ocular blood flow in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). Recent trials confirmed the greater IOP-lowering efficacy of latanoprost vs. timolol, dorzolamide, brimonidine and <b>unoprostone.</b> Trials lasting up to 24 months showed that latanoprost is effective in long-term treatment of POAG and ocular hypertension (OH), with no signs of loss of efficacy when compared to timolol or dorzolamide. Latanoprost provides better control of circadian IOP. Non-responders to beta-blockers should preferably be switched to latanoprost monotherapy before a combination therapy is started. The possibility of a fixed combination of latanoprost and timolol has been explored, with promising results. NTG: Latanoprost is effective in normal tension glaucoma (NTG), lowering IOP, improving pulsatile ocular blood flow and increasing ocular perfusion pressure. OTHER GLAUCOMAS: Latanoprost may provide effective IOP control in angle-closure glaucoma after iridectomy, in pigmentary glaucoma, glaucoma after cataract extraction and steroid-induced glaucoma. However, latanoprost was effective in only a minority of pediatric cases of glaucoma and is contraindicated in all forms of uveitic glaucoma.

40|$|Based on {{the body}} of {{evidence}} implicating ocular blood flow disturbances in the pathogenesis of glaucoma, there is great interest in the investigation of the effects of antiglaucoma drugs and systemic medications on the various ocular vascular beds. The primary aim of this article was to review the current data available on the effects of antiglaucoma drugs and systemic medications on ocular blood flow. We performed a literature search in November 2002, which consisted of a textword search in MEDLINE for the years 1968 - 2002. The results of this review suggest that there is a severe lack of well-designed long-term studies investigating the effects of antiglaucoma and systemic medications on ocular blood flow in glaucomatous patients. However, among the 136 articles dealing with the effect of antiglaucoma drugs on ocular blood flow, only 36 (26. 5 %) investigated the effects of medications on glaucoma patients. Among these 36 articles, only 3 (8. 3 %) were long-term studies, and only 16 (44. 4 %) were double-masked, randomized, prospective trials. Among the 33 articles describing the effects of systemic medications on ocular blood flow, only 11 (33. 3 %) investigated glaucoma patients, of which only one (9. 1 %) was a double-masked, randomized, prospective trial. Based on this preliminary data, we would intimate that few antiglaucoma medications have the potential to directly improve ocular blood flow. <b>Unoprostone</b> appears to have a reproducible antiendothelin- 1 effect, betaxolol may exert a calcium-channel blocker action, apraclonidine consistently leads to anterior segment vasoconstriction, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors seem to accelerate the retinal circulation.

40|$|Glaucoma is {{the most}} common cause of {{blindness}} worldwide. One of the main risk factors for the pathogenesis of glaucoma is an increased intraocular pressure (IOP) and lowering of IOP is the only successful therapy for this disease. The trabecular meshwork, through which the bulk of aqueous humor outflow occurs, is via contractile mechanisms actively involved in aqueous humor outflow and thus in regulation of IOP. The concentration of endothelin- 1 is increased in aqueous humor of glaucoma patients and endothelin- 1 seems to be involved in the development of glaucoma. In addition to numerous ocular effects, endothelin- 1 causes contraction of trabecular meshwork, thus leading to reduced aqueous humor outflow and increased IOP. Thus, the endothelin-induced signaling pathways leading to contraction of this tissue are of particular interest for glaucoma research, since inhibition of these pathways can be used therapeutically to reduce IOP. It was shown that endothelin- 1 induces contraction of trabecular meshwork via an increase in intracellular calcium and activation of MLCK and also calcium-independent, involving G-protein RhoA and Rho kinase. From animal studies it is known that inhibition of these pathways causes lowering of IOP. Since these signaling pathways are also activated by muscarinic agonists, such inhibition affects all parasympathetic innervated muscles in the anterior chamber, so that physiological parameters such as accommodation and pupil size can be influenced. A specific inhibition of endothelin-induced contraction of trabecular meshwork is achieved by blocking of endothelin receptor A. It has been shown in animal studies that blocking of this receptor induced lowering of IOP. Furthermore, prostaglandin F-receptor agonists, such as PGF 2 a, fluoprostenol, and <b>unoprostone,</b> caused inhibition of endothelin- 1 -induced contraction, whereas contraction induced by muscarinic agonists is not affected. This endothelin antagonism is responsible for the rapid reduction of IOP elicited by prostaglandin analogues which have become first-line therapy in the medical treatment of glaucoma. Thus, the antagonism of endothelin effects on trabecular meshwork contractility is a way to increase aqueous humor outflow and to lower IOP. The endothelin-dependent signaling pathways of this tissue are therefore a suitable target for IOP-lowering drugs...|$|E
