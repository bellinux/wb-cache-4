5|$|Only the {{serrated}} {{and often}} keratinized {{tip of the}} sublingua is free to move small distances along the <b>underside</b> of the tongue, {{while the majority of}} its length adheres to the <b>underside</b> of the tongue. These free-moving folds or filaments are called the plica fimbriata and attach {{to the base of the}} sublingua and are supported at the midline by the plica mediana. The plica fimbriata is highly developed and specialized in lemurs, and makes up the majority of the sublingua.|$|E

50|$|These female {{butterflies}} oviposit eggs in bunches on the <b>undersides</b> {{of leaves}} because the larvae prefer the morphology of leaf <b>undersides</b> over the upper surface of leaves. To oviposit, the female butterflies use {{the tip of}} the abdomen and arrange the eggs in specific batches.|$|R

5|$|Post-flight {{inspection}} of the thermal protection system tiles found seven major debris impacts and forty-nine minor impacts, of which three and twenty-six respectively were on the orbiter's <b>underside.</b> This was the lowest incidence of major tile damage until at least STS-74, and compares very favorably with the program average of twenty-three major impacts to the <b>underside.</b> It was the first Shuttle flight with no significant problems reported for the thermal protection system. Three windows {{were removed from the}} orbiter due to pitting and hazing.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen is {{long and}} slender and {{consists}} of 10 segments and a terminal appendage-bearing segment. The second and third segments are enlarged, and in males, a cleft on the <b>underside</b> of the second segment contains a pair of claspers and the penis. The spermaries open on the 9th segment. In females, the genital opening is on the <b>underside</b> of the eighth segment and is covered by a simple flap or an ovipositor, depending on species and the method of egg-laying.|$|E
5|$|The adult California condor is {{a uniform}} black with the {{exception}} of large triangular patches or bands of white on the <b>underside</b> of the wings. It has gray legs and feet, an ivory-colored bill, a frill of black feathers surrounding the base of the neck, and brownish red eyes. The juvenile is mostly a mottled dark brown with blackish coloration on the head. It has mottled gray instead of white on the <b>underside</b> of its flight feathers.|$|E

5|$|Large chromatophores densely {{cover the}} upper {{surfaces}} of the head, mantle and arms. They are distributed more sparsely on the ventral side. The fins do not possess chromatophores on the <b>underside.</b> Living specimens range in colour from translucent creamy white through pale yellow to brownish pink and brownish violet.|$|E

5|$|No fossil {{evidence}} of Dimetrodons skin {{has yet been}} found. Impressions of {{the skin of a}} related animal, Estemmenosuchus, indicate {{that it would have been}} smooth and well-provided with glands. Dimetrodon also may have had large scutes on the <b>underside</b> of its tail and belly, as other synapsids did.|$|E

5|$|The cookiecutter shark uses {{bioluminescence}} to camouflage its <b>underside</b> by counterillumination, but a {{small patch}} near its pectoral fins remains dark, appearing as a small fish to large predatory fish like tuna and mackerel swimming beneath it. When such fish approach the lure, they are bitten by the shark.|$|E
5|$|The {{immature}} American goldfinch has a dull brown back, and the <b>underside</b> is pale yellow. The {{shoulders and}} tail are dull black with buff-colored, rather than white, markings on wings and rump. This coloration {{is the same}} in both genders.|$|E
5|$|The summer pelage of {{different}} subspecies varies drastically but is generally dark or cinnamon brown. The back is dull, yellowish, ochre-grey in colour, with dark brown to black {{tips of the}} hairs. The latus (side of the body between therib cageand theuppermost and largest part of the hip bone) is tinged with rust-red, and the <b>underside</b> is pale yellowish ochre. In winter, its pelage turns grey, with a yellowish tinge; the <b>underside</b> becomes greyish brown, and the anterior dorsum and head are tinged with yellow. The incisive foramen (funnel-shaped opening in the bonyplate of theskull, located in {{the roof of the}} mouth,immediately behind theincisor teethwhere blood vessels and nerves pass) are round, small, and are detached from the palatine foramen.|$|E
