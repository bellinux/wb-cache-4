5|$|Sons of Soul was {{produced}} entirely by the group, {{who worked with}} various session musicians and <b>utilized</b> <b>both</b> vintage and contemporary recording equipment. They intended {{to pay homage to}} their musical influences—classic soul artists of the 1960s and 1970s—and incorporated live instrumentation, funk, and hip hop elements such as samples and scratches. Lead singer and bassist Raphael Wiggins handled most of the songwriting, which featured quirky, flirtatious lyrics.|$|E
5|$|Sega {{would go}} on to release the add-on's second model, the Sega CD 2 (Mega-CD 2), on April 23, 1993 in Japan at a price of JP¥29,800, It was {{released}} in North America several months later at the reduced retail price of US$229, with one of the system's best-selling games, Sewer Shark, as a pack-in. Designed to bring down the manufacturing costs of the Sega CD, the newer model is smaller and does not contain the motorized disc tray used in the initial model. A limited number of games were also later developed that <b>utilized</b> <b>both</b> the Sega CD and the 32X add-ons, the latter of which was released in November 1994.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{with their}} {{previous}} albums, the group produced Sons of Soul entirely themselves. They <b>utilized</b> <b>both</b> vintage and contemporary recording gear in the album's production, including a Hammond B-3, Clavinet, ARP String Ensemble, and Korg and Roland synthesizers. Riley viewed that hearing music played {{from the older}} instruments affected their songwriting. For his vocals, Raphael recorded with Neumann U87 and AKG C12A condensor microphones, {{as well as a}} vintage RCA Type77-DX microphone. He used a custom five-string bass from a guitar and bass repair shop in San Francisco, as well as a Minimoog analog synthesizer for other bass lines on the album. D'wayne used a Microtech Gefell UM70 for his lead vocals and an AKG 414 for his background vocals. He played a vintage Gibson L6-S and a Fender Coronado guitar, modified with Gibson burst bucker pickups. Aside from his drumming, Riley played both Wurlitzer and Fender Rhodes electric pianos.|$|E

25|$|In 2004 {{two more}} storm chaser tools emerged. The first, WxWorx, {{was a new}} XM Satellite Radio based system {{utilizing}} a special receiver and Baron Services weather software. Unlike preexisting cellular based services there was no risk of dead spots, and that meant {{that even in the}} most remote areas storm chasers still had a live data feed. The second tool was a new piece of software called GRLevel3. GRLevel3 <b>utilized</b> <b>both</b> free and subscription based raw radar files, displaying the data in a true vector format with GIS layering abilities. Since 2006 a growing number of chasers are using Spotter Network (SN), which uses GPS data to plot real time position of participating spotters and chasers, and allows observers to report significant weather as well as GIS layering for navigation maps, weather products, and the like.|$|E

[...] Full motion video quality was poor on the Sega CD due to poor video compression software and the system's limited color palette, and the concept never caught on with the public.

[...] The video in these sequences have also been criticized, with the quality being considered comparable to an old VHS tape.|$|E
