5|$|About 1.2billion {{people in}} {{developing}} nations lack clean, safe water because most household and industrial wastes are dumped directly into rivers and lakes without treatment. This contributes to the rapid increase in waterborne diseases in humans. Out of India's 3119 towns and cities, just 209 have partial treatment facilities, and only 8 have full wastewater treatment facilities (WHO 1992). 114 cities dump untreated sewage and partially cremated bodies directly into the Ganges River. Downstream, the <b>untreated</b> <b>water</b> is used for drinking, bathing, and washing. This situation is typical of many rivers in India {{as well as other}} developing countries.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{population}} density of Varanasi and {{the increasing number of}} tourists, the Uttar Pradesh government and international non-governmental organisations and institutions have expressed grave concern for the pollution and pressures on infrastructure in the city, mainly the sewage, sanitation, and drainage components. Pollution of the Ganges is a particular source of worry because of the religious significance of the river, the dependence of people on it as a source of drinking water, and its prominence as a symbol of Varanasi and the city itself. The sewage problem is exacerbated by the role of the Ganges in bathing and in river traffic, which is very difficult to control. Because of the sewage, people using local <b>untreated</b> <b>water</b> have higher risk of contracting a range of water-borne stomach diseases.|$|E
5|$|The {{town has}} some 19th-century {{buildings}} listed {{on both the}} Register of the National Estate and the Tasmanian Heritage Register. Hagley Mill is noted as possibly the only extant mill in Australia that was horse-driven. Quamby Estate, the former estate of Sir Richard Dry, is run as a tourist attraction and has a 9-hole golf course. Hagley's reticulated water supply is sourced from a filtration and treatment plant at nearby Westbury. This plant opened in 2013; from 1902 until then the town had received <b>untreated</b> <b>water.</b> From 1871 the town was serviced by passenger rail, but this ceased prior to 1978. Hagley was originally {{on the main road}} from Launceston to Deloraine, but was bypassed in 2001 when the Hagley section of the Bass Highway was completed.|$|E
5|$|The natural <b>untreated</b> <b>water</b> is {{generally}} devoid of all minerals, bacteria, and suspended matter, approaching {{the purity of}} distilled water. In 1987 Malvern gained official EU status as a natural mineral water, a mark of purity and quality. However, in spite of regular quality analysis, Malvern's reputation for purity suffered a blow when the rock that filters the water dried out during 2006, allowing the water from heavy storms to flow through it too quickly for the natural filtering process to take place efficiently. Due to the slight impurities, the Coca-Cola Company, manufacturer of the Schweppes brand, had to install filtration equipment, which reclassifies the water as spring water under European Union law. Consequently, the labels were change from: Malvern The Original English Natural Mineral Water. Naturally filtered through Pre-Cambrian granite and sourced from deep beneath the Malvern Hills. to read The Original English Water Bottled in the Malvern Hills.|$|E

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of Campylobacter spp was examined {{in a variety}} of waters in Northern Ireland. Conventional cultural techniques were employed with 768 water specimens, including drinking waters (tap, spring, bore hole and bottled) and recreational waters (swimming pool, lough, river and sea). Positive waters included 1 / 11 (9. 1 %) drinking <b>water</b> from <b>untreated</b> well <b>water,</b> as well as 5 / 12 (41. 7 %) <b>untreated</b> surface <b>waters</b> from loughs and 7 / 8 (87. 5 %) <b>untreated</b> river <b>waters.</b> Overall, <b>untreated</b> surface <b>waters</b> may represent a source of contamination with Campylobacter spp. in Northern Ireland, where they have a recreational involvement or are used as a drinking source by man or agricultural livestock. Therefore waterborne campylobacteriosis should be considered in patients presenting with acute enteritis and a history of participation in water sports/activities. As faecal coliform organisms have been previously shown to be poor markers of water quality, especially for Campylobacter spp, new criteria should be established to assess the risk of this infection and to evaluate and monitor the quality of water used for recreational purposes...|$|R

25|$|Copepods are {{sometimes}} found in public main water supplies, especially systems {{where the water}} is not filtered, such as New York City, Boston, and San Francisco. This is not usually a problem in treated water supplies. In some tropical countries, such as Peru and Bangladesh, a correlation has been found between copepods' presence and cholera in <b>untreated</b> <b>water,</b> because the cholera bacteria attach to the surfaces of planktonic animals. The larvae of the guinea worm must develop within a copepod's digestive tract before being transmitted to humans. The risk of infection with these diseases can be reduced by filtering out the copepods (and other matter), for example with a cloth filter.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that each year about 17,000 children die from diarrhea. One reason is that drinking water quality is often below standards.

25|$|Water {{and steam}} {{are a common}} fluid used for heat exchange, due to its {{availability}} and high heat capacity, both for cooling and heating. Cool water may even be naturally available from a lake or the sea. It's especially effective to transport heat through vaporization and condensation of water because of its large latent heat of vaporization. A disadvantage is that metals commonly found in industries such as steel and copper are oxidized faster by <b>untreated</b> <b>water</b> and steam. In almost all thermal power stations, water is used as the working fluid (used in a closed loop between boiler, steam turbine and condenser), and the coolant (used to exchange the waste heat to a water body or carry it away by evaporation in a cooling tower). In the United States, cooling power plants is the largest use of water.|$|E

40|$|M. Tech. Background: Waterborne disease {{contributes}} {{significantly to}} the total global disease burden. Populations in rural areas of South Africa depend on <b>untreated</b> <b>waters</b> for consumption and sanitation. Contamination of public water supplies by harmful bacteria such as pathogenic E. coli poses a major risk for public health. Ingestion of these pathogenic microorganisms present in the contaminated and <b>untreated</b> <b>waters</b> could cause infection, leading to systemic inflammatory responses manifested by the production of various proinflammatory cytokines. To date, there is no human system test available to detect whether water, following ingestion, would cause disease (i. e. whether the water is infectious). The current water testing methods only test {{for the presence of}} indicator organisms, such as faecal coliforms, total coliforms, and Escherichia coli. A reliable in-vitro bioassay that could assess whether the water would cause an inflammatory response was investigated in this study. Objectives: Pro-inflammatory cytokines and whole-blood have been used in similar studies to detect the inflammatory responses following exposure to specific stimulants such as dust, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), E. coli and various others. It has been reported that larger numbers of these contaminants induced higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. This implies that the pro-inflammatory cytokine expression {{could be used as a}} marker of infection since, inflammation occurs in response to infection. Successful infection is thus necessary for inflammation to occur, and high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression confirm that infection has occurred. Thus if pro-inflammatory cytokines could serve as indicators for infection, these cytokines could be used as indicators for bacterial pathogenicity of water...|$|R

25|$|Water is {{also used}} in many large scale {{industrial}} processes, such as thermoelectric power production, oil refining, fertilizer production and other chemical plant use, and natural gas extraction from shale rock. Discharge of <b>untreated</b> <b>water</b> from industrial uses is pollution. Pollution includes discharged solutes (chemical pollution) and increased water temperature (thermal pollution). Industry requires pure water for many applications and utilizes a variety of purification techniques both in water supply and discharge. Most of this pure water is generated on site, either from natural freshwater or from municipal grey water. Industrial consumption of water is generally much lower than withdrawal, due to laws requiring industrial grey water to be treated {{and returned to the}} environment. Thermoelectric powerplants using cooling towers have high consumption, nearly equal to their withdrawal, as most of the withdrawn water is evaporated as part of the cooling process. The withdrawal, however, is lower than in once-through cooling systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{metropolitan}} {{region has}} developed many utilities which have primary focus {{on energy and}} environmental health. A focal point of cross-border environmental relations is {{the care of the}} Tijuana River Estuary. The International Boundary Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWTP) was developed by the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) as a joint project between the USA and Mexico in the mid-1990s following substantial environmental studies regarding the polluting affects of the river system from run-off and <b>untreated</b> <b>water</b> on the Tijuana side of the border region. The facility now treats sewage flows exceeding the capacity of the present Tijuana sewage treatment system. The plant directly assists in the restoration of the Tijuana River Valley. Another collaborative effort between the two cities was the environmentally friendly development of paved roads - created by placing concrete blocks on dirt roads - in the San Bernardo neighborhood of northwestern Tijuana. Whilst being a good example for overall development of Tijuana, it served to retain water in the earth and prevented possible negative impacts from floodwater.|$|E
500|$|The Zarqa {{river is}} highly polluted.
