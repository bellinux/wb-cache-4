500|$|A {{social network}} {{is a social}} {{structure}} composed of individuals (or organizations) called [...] "nodes", which are tied (connected) {{by one or more}} specific types of interdependency, such as friendship, kinship, financial exchange, dislike, sexual relationships, or relationships of beliefs, knowledge or prestige. Social networks operate on many levels, from families up to the level of nations, and {{play a critical role in}} determining the way problems are solved, organizations are run, and the degree to which individuals succeed in achieving their goals. An underlying theoretical assumption of social network analysis is that groups are not necessarily the building blocks of society: the approach is open to studying less-bounded social systems, from non-local communities to networks of exchange. Drawing theoretically from relational sociology, social network analysis avoids treating individuals (persons, organizations, states) as discrete <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis,</b> it focuses instead on how the structure of ties affects and constitutes individuals and their relationships. In contrast to analyses that assume that socialization into norms determines behaviour, network analysis looks to see the extent to which the structure and composition of ties affect norms. On the other hand, recent research by Omar Lizardo also demonstrates that network ties are shaped and created by previously existing cultural tastes. Social network theory is usually defined in formal mathematics and may include integration of geographical data into Sociomapping.|$|E
2500|$|Focus group {{discussion}} in qualitative method has gain huge popularity {{of this method}} across the social sciences over the past decade. Focus groups are now thoroughly assessable and familiar to the general public. Prior 1920’s and late 1970’s the focus groups were mainly used in marketing, tool, and studies {{in the field in}} the business. Aspects like including education, communication, media studies, feminist research, sociology and social psychology. Focused groups are also known as ‘group interviews’. The members are encouraged to interact and have discussions. The data collected by focused {{group discussion}} are seldom produced through interview and observation; it enlightens us with its power of knowledge. Focus group discussion also focuses on the process beyond the individual’s memory and desires. The richness and complexity of group dynamics should be considered. Focus group can also access to social interactional dynamics that produce particular memories, ideologies, and practices among the group members. It themselves becomes relevant, termed as <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> of our study. Questions, issues and topics process focus group. Through different dynamics multiple angles of vision {{can be seen in the}} new world in unexpected ways. Focus group helps us move towards constructing a ‘methodology of getting lost” and toward enacting “double practices” (lather, 2001). This seems a necessary step towards conducting qualitative research. Keeping norms and rules of groups in mind the researcher and research participants realize that interpretation of individual are situated, provisional, contingent, unstable thus it’s unchangeable. It is necessary for the researcher to have self-reflectivity that involves making the research transparent rhetorical and poetic work of the researcher in representing the object of the study. It is theoretically important to construct a mutual ground between the researcher and the research participants. The second sense of self-reflexivity is important to encourage refection on interpretive research as the dual practice of knowledge gathering and self transformation is done through self-reflection and mutual reflection. Allowing ourselves to dwell in the existing inevitable indeterminacies, we are leading ourselves in the best way of the qualitative research practice.|$|E

30|$|The spatial <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> is {{the basic}} {{geographic}} entity for which the metrics presented above are computed. While there is no systematic method to select such unit, two considerations {{should be taken into}} account when choosing one. First, given that some of the metrics are based on the count of street intersections, the spatial unit should be big enough to contain some of these elements. For example, a <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> comprising <b>of</b> a 500 meters by 500 meters block might not be suited for the approach proposed, as it might not have any intersection within its boundary. Second, official units that existed {{for a long period of}} time are generally better suited than, for example, more grid-shaped ones. Historical boundaries, in fact, tend to keep the morphological unity of neighbourhoods, for example, by not cutting buildings or blocks. This provides metrics that better reflect what exists in the real world. Once the spatial <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> is selected, metrics of urban form and socio-economics should be computed and aggregated for such unit. Note that the selection <b>of</b> any <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> is affected by the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP), [41] that is values of spatial variables might change based on the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> selected for the study. This is a common issue that affects spatial analyses at areal level. We will come back to this in the Limitations.|$|R

A semantic discontinuity comprises any significant change of content.

5000|$|Inspired by Trubetzkoy, [...] {{proposed}} {{a synthesis of}} linguistic geography and descriptive linguistics by applying the structuralist concept of grammar to the description of regular correspondences between different varieties; a resulting supergrammar, which he called a diasystem, {{would be consistent with}} the individual grammars of all the member dialects. A diasystem is a higher order system and its component <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> would accordingly be abstractions of a higher order than the <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> of the individual systems. That is, just as the phones present within an individual variety are grouped together into abstract phonemes, the phonemes present within a group of varieties could be grouped together into even more abstract diaphonemes.

30|$|Following this stance, {{this study}} uses a {{multiple}} {{case study method}} because it aims to compare the European chocolate brands and understand their strategy outside Europe. Second, the dimension concern in case study design is to decide on a single-holistic <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> or the use <b>of</b> multiple embedded <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> (Yin 2013). This study uses only a single <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> that is marketing strategy, and therefore made it a holistic study. The comparison between four European chocolate brands in this paper is mainly focuses on their marketing strategies, which the combinations of marketing mix, resource based view, and semiotic theory, are appropriate to use for the investigation. The significance of following this case study research design is it may offer a robust framework for data collection and increase the explanatory power, and generalisability of the data collection process (Yin 2013). As this paper is a broad overview study, a holistic multiple-case study is the most suitable, and having more than two cases will produce an even stronger effect (Yin 2013).
