5|$|An {{offer of}} four Type Zero {{airships}} {{was turned down}} due to doubts about their usability above 6,000feet and the expense of replacing the envelopes, which were estimated to have a <b>useful</b> <b>life</b> of only three months in the harsh South African sunshine.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its high}} cost, {{portable}} X-ray devices use thulium {{that has been}} bombarded in a nuclear reactor as a radiation source. These sources have a <b>useful</b> <b>life</b> of about one year, as tools in medical and dental diagnosis, {{as well as to}} detect defects in inaccessible mechanical and electronic components. Such sources do not need extensive radiation protection – only a small cup of lead.|$|E
5|$|Potter's {{adolescence}} was a {{quiet as}} her childhood. She grew into a spinsterish young woman whose parents groomed {{her to be a}} permanent resident and housekeeper in their home. She wanted to lead a <b>useful</b> <b>life</b> independent of her parents and considered a career in mycology, but the all-male scientific community regarded her as an amateur and she abandoned fungi. She continued to paint and draw, and experienced her first professional artistic success in 1890 when she sold six designs of humanised animals to a greeting card publisher.|$|E

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} its <b>useful</b> <b>life,</b> {{the sword}} served more as a weapon of {{self-defence}} than for use on the battlefield, and the military importance of swords steadily decreased during the Modern Age. Even as a personal sidearm, the sword began to lose its preeminence in the early 19th century, reflecting the development of reliable handguns.|$|E
25|$|A {{committee}} {{was formed to}} investigate {{the future of the}} tramway system and reported back in July 1946 that as each line reached the end of its <b>useful</b> <b>life</b> it should be closed and replaced with buses. Providing services to new areas had become a priority, especially as the city was growing beyond the extent of the tramway network.|$|E
50|$|The {{charge was}} {{contained}} in six cloth bags. Each bag contained 45 kg of smokeless powder. High explosive (HE) shells weighed only 774 kg. Anticipated <b>useful</b> barrel <b>life</b> was approximately 120 effective full charges (EFC).|$|R
40|$|The multi-disciplinary {{approach}} has been adopted to model the formation and propagation of blistering effect for evaluation of <b>useful</b> coating <b>life</b> in the multi-layered coating-substrate system. Prognostic model of de-bonding driving force has been formulated {{as a function of}} material science, solid mechanics and fracture mechanics properties to estimate critical, safe and fail conditions of the coating-substrate system. The blister growth velocity rate is also included in the developed model to estimate the blister propagation as a function of diffusion-induced stress and residual stress. The proposed prognostic modelling for the formation and propagation of blistering effect are combined to form an assessment model for evaluation of <b>useful</b> coating <b>life</b> of the multi-layered coating-substrate system and validated through experimental observation...|$|R
40|$|The {{valuation}} of an asset {{is one of}} the most important thing with accounting, though one of the most difficult thing as well. However, in deciding <b>useful</b> service <b>life</b> for an intangible asset and property, plant and equipment, there are quite a margin for the companies, which creates a difference between companies and industries. When computing the value of the inventories there are a few possibilities available for the companies, which also can generate differences between companies and industries. Although these differences can occur, there might be some similarities in the companies’ estimates. Hence, the purpose of this essay is to establish whether there are any differences in how companies are assessing their <b>useful</b> service <b>life</b> of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and deciding the value of inventories. To be able to accomplish the purpose, company’s annual reports were used along with other necessary sources, for instance books about accounting principles and theories. The study, furthermore, concluded that there are small differences between companies within the same industry and industries altogether, in their judgment on <b>useful</b> service <b>life</b> and the value of the inventories...|$|R

In order to meet the in-service date of 2026, advanced design work on the next generation of Australian submarines will begin by 2014–15. At this very early stage, it appears probable that the submarines will be Australian-built conventional submarines equipped with air independent propulsion and advanced combat and communications systems.|$|E
25|$|Propane lacks additives, {{detergents}} {{or other}} chemical enhancements further reducing the exhaust output from the tailpipe. The cleaner combustion also has fewer particulate emissions, lower NOx {{due to the}} complete combustion of the gas within the cylinder, higher exhaust temperatures increasing {{the efficiency of the}} catalyst and deposits less acid and carbon inside the engine which extends the <b>useful</b> <b>life</b> of the lubricating oil.|$|E

25|$|For weather {{observation}} Japan {{launched in}} February 2005 the Multi-Functional Transport Satellite 1R (MTSAT-1R). The {{success of this}} launch was critical for Japan, since the original MTSAT-1 couldn't be put into orbit because of a launch failure with the H-2 rocket in 1999. Since then Japan relied for weather forecasting on an old satellite which was already beyond its <b>useful</b> <b>life</b> term and on American systems.|$|E
25|$|Compared to buses, {{costs can}} be lower due to lower labor costs per {{passenger}} mile, higher ridership (observations show that light rail attracts more ridership than a comparable bus service) and faster average speed (reducing {{the number of}} vehicles needed for the same service frequency). While light rail vehicles are more expensive to buy, they have a longer <b>useful</b> <b>life</b> than buses, sometimes making for lower life-cycle costs.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{opened in}} 1928, it was privately built by an {{organization}} led by South Norfolk businessmen Wallace and Carl Jordan. It was later renamed the Jordan Bridge, principally to honor long-standing manager Carl M. Jordan. The oldest drawbridge in Virginia, the 80-year-old bridge {{had reached the}} end of its <b>useful</b> <b>life</b> by 2008. Faced with diminishing returns on millions of dollars in needed maintenance and unknown reliability, it was permanently closed on November 8, 2008.|$|E

40|$|This paper compares and {{contrasts}} three {{methods that}} are <b>useful</b> for <b>life</b> course researchers; the more widely used sequence analysis, the promising but less often applied latent class growth models, and multistate event history models. The {{strengths and weaknesses}} of each method are highlighted by applying them to the same empirical problem. Using data from the Norwegian Generations and Gender Survey, changes in the partnership status of women born between 1955 and 1964 are modelled, with education as the primary covariate of interest. We show that latent class growth models and multistate event history models are a <b>useful</b> addition to <b>life</b> course researchers’ methodological toolkit and that these methods can address certain research questions better than the more commonly applied sequence analysis or simple event history analysis...|$|R
