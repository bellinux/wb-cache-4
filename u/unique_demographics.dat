The existing hub-and-spoke bus transit system is being challenged by the City’s suburbanization movement and declining downtown area. To accommodate this trend and unmet transit needs, this paper recommends strengthening the bus transit services in the urban fringe residential areas, rather than exclusively focusing on the suburb-downtown transit improvements.

These results are plausible since HBV-related HCCs tend to overexpress hepatic progenitor genes (Guerrieri et al. 2013), with HBV-encoded X antigen promoting stemness {{at least to some}} extent (Arzumanyan et al. 2011). Accordingly, studies on Asian HCC cohorts (Yong et al. 2013; Oikawa et al. 2013; Zeng et al. 2014; Han et al. 2014) demonstrated frequent SALL 4 immunoreactivity, and studies on Western cohorts (Miettinen et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2014) found that SALL 4 -immunopositive HCCs were rare.

We examined migration, closetedness, and family structure explanations of demographic profiles of urban MSM using data from the Urban Men’s Health Study and the Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) of the U.

The data suggested that the demographic profiles of urban MSM obtained in population based surveys of urban areas are reasonable since MSM in urban areas reflect a large in-migrating white, often young adult, population without children. We concluded that MSM communities are cities within cities with <b>unique</b> <b>demographics</b> that may differ from the general population of the cities in which they live. Although there may be some related sampling bias associated with nondisclosure among ethnic minority MSM population segments, this bias may have little impact on population level estimates.

40|$|Variation in {{the human}} monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) gene can {{influence}} neurotransmittor levels and {{is thought to have}} a role in many behavioral traits. The genetic architecture of MAO-A is known to vary across different geographic subgroups. Previous studies have reported evidence for positive selection within the MAO-A gene region in seven ethnic groups: Pygmy, Aboriginal Taiwanese, Chinese, Japanese, Mexican and Russian. Polynesian populations have not been tested and repeated founder effects due to the island-hopping voyages of Polynesians across the South Pacific suggest a <b>unique</b> <b>demographic</b> history exists at the MAO-A gene, perhaps including selective effects. To explore this, we genotyped 13 key single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning MAO-A gene as well as the functional polymorphism (MAO-A-uVNTR) in 47 unrelated Maori individuals. A comparison of genetic variation between Maori and non-Maori groups found a substantial reduction in genetic diversity at the MAO-A gene locus and an increase in the frequency of the most common MAO-A gene variant in the Maori group. Results of this study support previous findings and also point toward a 5 -SNP haplotype that may have been influenced by selective effects in the Maori population. Full-sequence data for MAO-A in a large cohort are now required to conclusively determine whether MAO-A has undergone positive selection in Polynesians. Overall, these new data describe a <b>unique</b> <b>demographic</b> history for the MAO-A gene in the Maori population and will be helpful for studies wishing to investigate MAO-A as a candidate gene for influencing behavioral traits in the Polynesians.

40|$|Introduction: Hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia {{continue}} to be major problems for the United States, and for Hispanics living in this nation. Screening for cardiovascular risk factors {{plays an important role}} in preventing disease. Acculturation and family cohesiveness have been implicated in health outcomes. This study describes cardiovascular screening behaviors in regards to blood pressure screening, blood glucose screening, and cholesterol screening in the Mexican – United States borderland area and informs the relationship between these screening behaviors and acculturation and family cohesiveness. Materials and Methods: This study uses data from a 1002 person survey conducted in the El Paso area. Answers to questions regarding blood pressure screening, blood glucose screening and cholesterol screening are analyzed along with factors regarding acculturation (Low=LA, and High=HA) and family cohesiveness levels. Fisher’s exact testing and multivariate logistic regression were used to examine associations between variables. Results: Blood sugar (p-value= 3 ̆c 0. 0001) and cholesterol (p-value= 0. 0023) screening behaviors showed higher screening rates for high family cohesiveness (HF) compared to low family cohesiveness (LF). Age and gender remained significant variables for each screening behavior in the multivariable regression analysis. With the High Acculturation/Low Family Cohesiveness (HALF) group as the reference there is a significant difference with the High Acculturation/High Family Cohesiveness (HAHF) group in all three cardiovascular screening behaviors. The Low Acculturation/High Family Cohesiveness (LAHF) group was significantly different from the reference group in blood glucose screening and cholesterol screening (p values= 0. 0051 and 0. 0074 respectively). The Low Acculturation/ Low Family Cohesiveness (LALF) group was not significantly different from the reference group in any of the cardiovascular screening behaviors. Conclusions: Public health implications include the need to encourage family cohesiveness which might improve cardiovascular health outcomes as a result of stronger family ties and better cardiovascular screening behaviors. Lower acculturation and higher family cohesiveness levels prevailed, demonstrating the <b>unique</b> <b>demographics</b> of the borderland population. Our data supports starting with an intervention to address blood glucose and blood cholesterol screening behavior in young (ages 18 - 39) Hispanic males who have low family cohesiveness and directing these interventions to address those in the HALF group. The combination of high acculturation with low family cohesiveness is affecting people negatively and influencing them not to perform any type of cardiovascular screening. Our study also demonstrates the importance of including psychosocial and cultural factors to better understand the heterogeneity of Mexican Americans and its implications to cardiovascular screening behaviors. Finally, our data supports other’s recommendations of opening more clinics across the nation with Spanish speakers on staff to improve cardiovascular screening rates in the LAHF group. ...|$|E
