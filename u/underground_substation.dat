2500|$|Despite the {{controversy}} over the number of stops and routes, a combination of Federal and State funding was obtained. In March 1972, the entire cost of the section between 34th Street and 126th Street, according to the projects Draft Environmental Study, was estimated to be $381 million. In June 1972, it was announced that the UMTA would grant $25 million for the construction of this section of the line. The MTA had requested $254 million in federal funds for {{the northern part of the}} line. Preliminary estimates of the cost of the southern portion of the line came to $450 million. The entire section was to be constructed using the cut-and-cover method of subway construction, in which a trench is dug in the middle of the street and later covering over it. 14,300 square yards of decking were to have been used to cover the trench, allowing for traffic on Second Avenue to not be interrupted. The entire line from Water Street to 180th Street in the Bronx was expected to be completed by 1980. On September 13, 1972, construction work on Section 11 of Route 132-A, the section between 99th Street and 105th Street, went up for bid, and Slattery Associates of Maspeth, Queens got the low bid of $17,480,266. The MTA board approved the award on September 22, 1972. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on October 27, 1972 at Second Avenue and 103rd Street. Construction began shortly thereafter on the segment. Work on the initial segment was slowed down due to a network of uncharted utility lines below the street. The utilities, as part of the construction, were to be relocated under the sidewalks. Old footings from the Second Avenue Elevated were found while the section was excavated. Another problem in the construction of this segment was the large amount of ground water, which put enormous pressure on the tunnel. An <b>underground</b> <b>substation</b> was constructed at 105th Street, and five feet of concrete had to be poured for the floor so that the structure would not float in the muck. This section is [...] long.|$|E
50|$|By 1972 {{with the}} arrival of {{numerous}} AEC Merlin and AEC Swift class single deck buses to operate the numerous one man operated services, and the further allocation of Daimler Fleetlines, parking space was becoming a problem. It therefore became necessary to park a dozen or so buses on nearby Glacier Metals' car park overnight. The garage was consequently enlarged between 1976-78, which encompassed the adjacent former <b>Underground</b> <b>substation,</b> and the LT Lifts and Escalators department which had to move out to new premises. During the reconstruction works, 18 vehicles were outstationed at Stonebridge (SE).|$|E

However, in recent years, {{there have been few}} studies on the seismic performance of underground electrical substations involving the interaction of soil–structure–equipment. To conduct the study, three-dimensional finite element models of an <b>underground</b> <b>substation</b> are established. The implicit dynamic numerical simulation analysis is performed by changing earthquake input motions, soil characteristics, electrical equipment type and structure depths. According to a seismic response analysis, acceleration amplification coefficients, displacements, stresses and internal forces are obtained and analyzed. It is found that (1) as a boundary condition of soil–structure, the coupling boundary is feasible in the seismic response of an underground substation; (2) the seismic response of an <b>underground</b> <b>substation</b> is sensitive to burial depth and elastic modulus; (3) the oblique incidence of input motion has a slight influence on the horizontal seismic response, but has {{a significant impact on the}} vertical seismic response; and (4) the bottom of the side wall is the seismic weak part of an <b>underground</b> <b>substation,</b> so it is necessary to increase the stiffness of this area...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{monitoring}} system {{by using the}} neutral current of transformers at substations of an electric power company named “neutral current monitoring”. It means {{that we have been}} measuring the telluric field by using the power line system in order to monitor the electromagnetic state of the underground over an extended time period. The principle of this system is as follow: the neutral points of the transformers in the substations are grounded to the earth and power lines connect them. If the neutral points of the transformers correspond to the grounded electrodes and the power line between substations corresponds to the electric wire between the electrodes, we can observe the telluric field and change of the electromagnetic structure of the <b>underground</b> between <b>substations</b> by measuring the current which flows at the neutral point of the transformer to some extent. We found that the neutral current is affected by various factors such as the geomagnetic changes and artificial noises like as the conventional telluric field observations. We would be able to investigate the underground electric conductivities near the substations by calculated response function between geomagnetic field data and neutral current data...|$|R

To examine further the risk associated with residential proximity to electricity supply equipment, distances to high-voltage lines, <b>underground</b> cables, <b>substations</b> and distribution circuits were collected for 3380 cases and 3390 controls. Magnetic field exposure from this equipment was calculated using distance, load and other circuit information. There was no evidence that either proximity to electrical installations or the magnetic field levels they produce in the UK is associated with increased risk of childhood leukaemia or any other cancer. Odds ratios of 0. 73 (95 % CI = 0. 42 – 1. 26) for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, 0. 75 (95 % CI = 0. 45 – 1. 25) for all leukaemias, 1. 08 (95 % CI = 0. 56 – 2. 09) for central nervous system cancers and 0. 92 (95 % CI = 0. 64 – 1. 34) for all malignancies were obtained for residence within 50 [*]m of an overhead line.

40|$|The {{distribution}} {{system of the}} future is going to be as much of a revolution to the electric energy industry as the wireless telephone has been to consumer communications. An electricity market transformation must occur before the changes can take place, but this evolution is already starting to occur {{in many parts of the}} country. In this paper, we discuss a vision for a future {{distribution system}}, areas that will be key for technology development, and the advantages of the new electricity market. Present day distribution systems are in a sense, unintelligent. Distribution systems respond to faults, or short circuits, by sensing the very high fault current and then opening circuit breakers to isolate the fault. Some newer automated systems determine fault location and then close other circuit breakers to provide an alternate path for power after the fault so that the number of customers left without power is minimized, but the extent of the reconfiguration is limited. Distribution systems also have some methods to regulate voltage, but there is little real time local response to contingencies such as loss of a transmission line or a generator. In present day distribution systems, there is very little control of load, or demand response, and Distributed Energy Resources (DER, distributed generation, storage, and responsive load) located in the distribution system are prohibited from even regulating voltage. In fact, industry standards and utility interconnection agreements typically require that when a contingency occurs on a distribution or transmission system that results in a voltage or frequency excursion, the DER is to disconnect rather than help. There is a pressing need to evolve the distribution system model to one that can respond to contingencies sensed locally, and has the local intelligence and autonomy to deal with contingencies such as unusual loading, transmission congestion, and line outages. Markets must be simple for customers to participate in the energy and reliability services transactions. In the future, distribution systems will have local monitors for current, voltage, and temperature at many locations such as <b>substations,</b> <b>underground</b> cable and transformer vaults, feeders and laterals. These monitors will input data to local agents. The local agents will be computers scattered throughout the distribution system constantly assessing system condition. The local agents will communicate quickly with their local sensors and with each other, and more slowly with status reports they send to the central control authority. The local agents will review temperature, current and voltage data and diagnose problems such as overloads, over/under voltages, and voltage presence on circuits that are supposed to be deenergized. They will also sense contingencies such as equipment outage due to faults. The local agents will be partially independent from central control and authorized to take corrective action when they diagnose problems. Some of the actions that will be taken will be local dispatch of DER, local capacitor connection, voltage regulator control, local circuit switching, and provision of local reliability services, such as load response. The local agents will report up to a central agent on a periodic basis. There will be several different types of local agents that will function together. One of the most important capabilities will be for the customers to participate in the energy and reliability services markets. With only a few exceptions, these markets are now only open to large generators and a few large loads. Reliability services, such as voltage regulation or reserve power, are much more effective when supplied locally at the load. In addition, local participation in these markets will provide demand elasticity in the load [...] something that is lacking now. At present, when power is scarce due to a contingency or severe weather, there is no customer response; customers continue to use the same amount because they do not see the market price. An elastic demand means that some customers would cut back during periods of shortage and high price. Elasticity in demand is essential for a healthy market system...|$|R
