In 2013 the Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration published an article highlighting this specific application.

During this reporting period, two types of coal samples have been tested for use in the dewatering and briquetting processes. These tests were carried out in conjunction with a selected hydrophobic binder as the dewatering reagent and an uniaxial hydraulic press.

40|$|Raw coal is {{typically}} subjected to beneficiation processes to remove mineral matter before being sold to market. The coal industry wants to improve combustible recovery, reduce beneficiation unit costs, and attain efficiency optimization, especially for fines and ultrafines. A key beneficiation method for fine and <b>ultrafine</b> <b>coals</b> is froth flotation, where frothing reagent {{is used to}} generate and stabilize air bubbles that capture and carry hydrophobic particles. Use of frothing reagent constitutes {{the main part of}} the flotation operation cost. A widely used frothing reagent is an aliphatic alcohol, methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC), but it has safety concern owing to its low flash point (approximately 40 degreesC). There is a pressing need for seeking a safer and cheaper frother. In the present work, we studied a cyclic alcohol, methyl cyclohexamethanol (MCHM) with a high flash point and compared its flotation performance with that of MIBC. The flotation tests were carried out using simulated process water. The results showed that MCHM was a more effective coal flotation frother than MIBC. Comparative studies of froth, foam, and thin foam film stabilities with these two frothers were undertaken to understand the observed difference in coal flotation performance. The results showed that MCHM generated more stable froth than MIBC. However, at a given concentration, both frothers gave almost equal foam stability and foam film stability. The results suggest the importance of understanding particle-surfactant interactions for controlling froth stability, which significantly affects the kinetic viability of the flotation process and its separation efficiency...|$|R

The novel surface modification technique developed at the the University of Kentucky Center for Applied Energy Research will be evaluated using vacuum, centrifuge, and hyperbaric filtration equipment. Dewatering tests will be conducted using the fine clean coal froth produced by the column flotation units at the Powell Mountain Coal Company, Mayflower Preparation Plant in St. Charles, Virginia.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of the current coal {{preparation}} research {{is to reduce the}} ash and sulfur content from coal, using fine grinding and various coal cleaning processes to separate finely disseminated mineral matter and pyrite from coal. Small coal particles are produced by the grinding operation, thus the <b>ultrafine</b> <b>coal</b> becomes very difficult to dewater. In addition, the <b>ultrafine</b> <b>coal</b> also creates problems during its transportation, storage and handling at utility plants. The current research is seeking to combine <b>ultrafine</b> <b>coal</b> dewatering and briquetting processes into a single stage operation, using hydrophobic binders as coal dewatering and binding reagents {{with the help of a}} compaction device. From previous tests, it has been found that coal pellets with a moisture content of less than 15 % and good wear and water resistance can be successfully fabricated at pressures of less than 6, 000 psi using a lab scale ram extruder. The primary objective of the research described in this quarter has been to extend the lab scale <b>ultrafine</b> <b>coal</b> dewatering and briquetting process into a pilot scale operation, based on the test data obtained from earlier research. A standard roller briquetting machine was used to dewater fine coal-binder mixtures during the briquetting process. The operating parameters, including moisture content of feed, feed rate, and roller speed, were evaluated on the basis of the performance of the briquettes. Briquettes fabricated at rates of up to 108 pellets per minute exhibited satisfactory water and wear resistance, i. e., less than 7. 5 % cured moisture and less than 8. 3 % weight loss after 6 min. of tumbling. Also, coal-binder samples with moisture contents of 40 percent have been successfully dewatered and briquetted.

40|$|A novel {{experimental}} {{system was}} established in order to investigate the effect of centrifugal forces on the hydrodynamic transport of particles through planar channels inclined at 70 ° to the axis of rotation. The device, consisting of a fluidized bed housing attached {{to a system of}} parallel inclined channels, was mounted inside a 2 m diameter centrifuge. Fluidization water was directed to the outer periphery of the system, entering the base of the housing. The water then flowed in a direction towards the centre of the centrifuge, through an open chamber 150 mm long, and then through the system of planar channels, 160 mm long. The channels had a perpendicular spacing of z= 1 mm. The water then emerged via an overflow weir, 400 mm from the centre of the centrifuge. Semi-batch elutriation experiments were conducted on a silica feed, 0 – 0. 060 mm in diameter, achieving separations defined in terms of the particle diameter, d, and centrifugal acceleration gG, where g is the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity. The throughput advantage achieved using G= 73 over a conventional fluidized bed with G= 1 ranged from 845 to 3094. The extraordinary results were in reasonable agreement with the theoretical throughput advantage described in the paper. It was concluded that the hydrodynamic benefits of the inclined channels and the centrifugal force multiplied. The centrifugal force produced further synergy with the system hydrodynamics, resulting in the suppression of the effects of particle size, and hence a powerful separation {{on the basis of the}} particle density.

The {{beneficiation}} of <b>ultrafine</b> <b>coal</b> by {{froth flotation}} {{is a widely}} used process, and its importance {{for the treatment of}} - 0. 1 mm coal has been appreciated of late in South African coal washing plants. A number of problems adversely affect the efficiency of this process, such as poor liberation, poor floatability, gangue entraiment/entrapment, and high mass recovery which can lead to throughput limitations in coal flotation equipment. Reverse coal flotation is a novel process which has been proposed to address three problems occurring in the conventional, "forward flotation" of coal, namely: high mass recovery, gangue entrainment and the variability of floatability of South African coals. In this process, the entire gangue fraction in the coal would. be floated in a single step process, with the clean coal product reporting as the tailings. To the author's knowledge, no_ such process has been investigated previously for coal flotation. In this thesis, a reverse flotation process for <b>ultrafine</b> <b>coal</b> beneficiation was developed from first principles. In order to obtain a clear understanding and interpretation of experimental flotation results, artificial feed mixtures consisting of blends of "pure" gangue and "pure" coal were used for a large section of the experimental testwork. Having established the technical viability of the process on these artificial mixtures, the flotation work was extended to four South African run-of-mine coals. The study comprised the selection of suitable reagents for reverse flotation and the evaluation of these reagents experimentally. Experimental testwork comprised batch adsorption tests, and flotation tests in a conventional, sub-aeration laboratory batch cell and in a laboratory column flotation cell. The process was evaluated in terms of coal recovery into the product and gangue removal in the waste stream, and its metallurgical performance was compared to conventional flotation using both the artificial feeds and r. o. m. coals...|$|E
40|$|Characterisation of {{the risk}} of acid rock {{drainage}} is typically achieved through the quantification of acid-generating and acid-consuming components present within a sample using initial laboratory-scale, chemical static tests. These static tests, however, consider ARD generation under chemical conditions and do not account for the role of micro-organisms.

The present study investigates the ARD potential of two <b>ultrafine</b> <b>coal</b> wastes samples using the standard static tests as well as the UCT biokinetic test to account for microbial ARD generation. The deportment of metal species under each test condition was also considered. The UCT biokinetic test results supported the static test classification, providing preliminary kinetic data on the ARD generation.

The objective was to develop an advanced pulse coal combustor at the {approximately} 100, 000 Btu/hr scale that can be integrated into a packaged space heating system for small residential applications. The strategy for the development effort included the scale down of the feasibility unit from 1 - 2 MMBtu/hr to 100, 000 Btu/hr to establish a baseline for isolating the effect of scale-down and new chamber configurations separately. Initial focus at the residential scale was concentrated on methods of fuel injection and atomization in a bare metal unit. This was followed by incorporating changes to the advanced chamber designs and testing of refractory-lined units. Multi-fuel capability for firing oil or gas as a secondary fuel was also established. Upon completion of the configuration and component testing, an optimum configuration would be selected for integrated testing of the pulse combustor unit.

Continuous research is conducted to develop suitable chemical and/or geometallurgical processes for aluminium extraction, preferably accompanied by minimal silicon extraction. The thermochemical treatment of a South African <b>ultrafine</b> <b>coal</b> fly ash was investigated to test the feasibility of recovering aluminium using ammonium sulphate, a widely available, low-cost, recyclable chemical agent. The optimum processing conditions were determined to be a temperature of 500 °C and a fly ash to ammonium sulphate weight ratio of 2 : 6 when a reaction time of 1 h was used. Water leaching of the reaction product obtained under these conditions resulted in the selective recovery of 95. 0 % aluminium from the amorphous phase, with b 0. 6 % Si extracted. Mullite was unlikely to have reacted with the extracting agent. Except for Si, the process was not element-selective, but the extraction of iron could be minimized by increasing the treatment temperature to 600 °C without compromising Al extraction.

During this reporting period, multi-stage treatment using the Falcon concentrator was conducted on a refuse pond ({minus} 100 mesh) coal sample and a {minus} 28 mesh run-of-mine coal sample. The results suggest that the Falcon concentrator can make an ideal separation for either sample in a single process. Recleaning was found to improve product grade, however, recovery was reduced sharply. In addition, the groups involved with the in-plant testing of the Floatex Hydrosizer met and organized the test plan which will be conducted at Kerr-McGee`s Galatia preparation plant during the next reporting period. Coal samples for the circuitry tests will be collected during, this time period...|$|E
40|$|Column {{flotation}} provides excellent {{recovery of}} <b>ultrafine</b> <b>coal</b> while producing low ash content concentrates. However, column flotation is not efficient for treating fine coal containing {{significant amounts of}} mixed-phase particles. Fortunately, enhanced gravity separation has proved {{to have the ability}} to treat the mixed-phased particles more effectively. A disadvantage of gravity separation is that ultrafine clay particles are not easily rejected. Thus, a combination of these two technologies may provide a circuit that maximizes both the ash and sulfur rejection that can be achieved by physical coal cleaning while maintaining a high energy recovery. This project is studying the potential of using different combinations of gravity separators, i. e., a Floatex hydrosizer and a Falcon Concentrator, and a proven flotation column, which will be selected based on previous studies by the principle investigator. During this reporting period, an extensive separation performance comparison between a pilot-scale Floatex Density Separator (18 {times} 18 -inch) and an existing spiral circuit has been conducted at Kerf-McGee Coal Preparation plan for the treatment of nominally {minus} 16 mesh coal. The results indicate that the Floatex is a more efficient separation device (E{sub p}= 0. 12) than a conventional coal spiral (E{sub p}= 0. 18) for Illinois seam coals. In addition, the treatment of {minus} 100 mesh Illinois No. 5 fine coal from the same plant using Falcon concentrator, column flotation (Packed-Column) and their different combinations was also evaluated. For a single operation, both Falcon concentrator and column flotation can produce a clean coal product with 90 % combustible recovery and 5 % ash content. In the case of the combined circuit, column flotation followed by the Falcon achieved a higher combustible recovery value (about 75 %) than that obtained by the individual units while maintaining an ash content less than 3 %...|$|E
40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical references. Acidic {{drainage}} as {{a result}} of mining and mineral processing activities is a growing concern. The effects of Acid Rock Drainage (ARD) include environmental pollution in the affected areas and beyond. As South Africa has water challenges, the potential threat of continual depletion of useable water resources through their contamination by ARD and other mining activities may affect economic productivity, as well as quality of life. Currently used ARD remediation measures are variable and costly, not only in South Africa but worldwide. End of pipe approaches such as treatment by neutralisation fail {{to reduce the risk of}} ARD generation and provide long term solutions. Further it fails to address the limited resource utilisation of the byproduct materials, currently disposed of as ARD forming wastes. The Department of Chemical Engineering, at UCT, has focused research onto the prevention of ARD generation and minimisation of waste. One approach proposed is the two stage froth flotation process for separating sulphides, responsible for ARD formation, from the remaining tailings, leaving these benign with respect to ARD. Testwork results have proven its technical feasibility using porphyry copper tailings, fine coal and more recently gold tailings. Historically, <b>ultrafine</b> <b>coal</b> was not treated by most collieries in South Africa, but disposed as waste. Oxidation of the pyrite in the coal leads to generation of acidic water. In this project, an economic analysis of the coal two stage flotation process for the mitigation of ARD formation is considered. This project proposes ARD prevention by desulphurisation of sulphide rich waste coal material as an in-process approach which can be incorporated into mineral process flowsheets or as an add-on process for desulphurisation of old workings. The two stage flotation may yield a valuable mineral or coal product, as well as a low volume sulphide rich fraction which can be processed further to yield sulphuric acid or disposed of with containment and a benign tailings fraction which can be used as cover material or disposed conventionally...|$|E
40|$|In South Africa, over 10 {{million tons}} of <b>ultrafine</b> <b>coal</b> wastes are {{discarded}} every year, typically {{in the form of}} ultrafine slurries. These fines have a high calorific value, and contain sulfur minerals, particularly pyrite. The high calorific value of these discards leads to a waste of energy that could be harnessed and used, while the high sulfur content contributes to adverse environmental effects such as acid rock drainage (ARD). The University of Cape Town (UCT) has developed a two-stage flotation process, which involves coal flotation in the first stage and pyrite flotation of the tailings in the second stage, for mitigating the ARD potential of ultrafine wastes. Research has shown that this two stage froth flotation process was sufficient to render the tailings non-acid forming. At the same time, North West University (NWU) has been carrying out research on coal fines using the recently invented reflux classifier. The reflux classifier is claimed to be capable of separating particles down to 38 ìm in size; however, no work has been done using the reflux classifier to separate pyrite from coal. This dissertation investigates the effectiveness of combining flotation and reflux classification for removing sulfide minerals from two South African coal ultrafines, whilst recovering valuable coal, and compares the results to those obtained using the UCT two-stage flotation process. As no previous work has been done using reflux classification to remove sulfide minerals from coal, {{this is the first time}} that the reflux classifier will be investigated for this purpose. Two process routes were investigated: (i) froth flotation followed by reflux classification of the tailings (process route 1), and (ii) reflux classification followed by froth flotation of the overflow (process route 2). Coal flotation, sulfide flotation and reflux classification were conducted on samples of Waterberg and Witbank coals, using a 3 L Leeds-type flotation cell and a 10 L batch reflux classifier constructed at NWU. Acid base accounting (ABA) and net acid generating (NAG) static characterization tests were performed on the products and feeds from all three process routes...|$|E
40|$|South African {{coal-fired}} power stations produce about 25 {{million tons of}} fly ash per annum, of which only approximately 5 % is currently reused. A growing concern about pollution and increasing landfill costs stimulates research into new ways to utilize coal fly ash for economically beneficial applications. Fly ash particles {{may be used as}} inorganic filler in polymers, an application which generally requires the modification of their surface properties. In order to design experiments that will result in controlled changes in surface chemistry and morphology, a detailed knowledge of the bulk chemical and mineralogical compositions of untreated fly ash particles, as well as their morphology and surface properties, is needed. In this paper, a combination of complementary bulk and surface techniques was explored to assess the physicochemical properties of a classified, <b>ultrafine</b> <b>coal</b> fly ash sample, and the findings were discussed in the context of polymer application as fillers. The sample was categorized as a Class F fly ash (XRF). Sixty-two percent of the sample was an amorphous glass phase, with mullite and quartz being the main identified crystalline phases (XRD, FTIR). Quantitative carbon and sulfur analysis reported a total bulk carbon and sulfur content of 0. 37 % and 0. 16 % respectively. The spatial distribution of the phases was determined by 2 D mapping of Raman spectra, while TGA showed a very low weight loss for temperatures ranging between 25 and 1000 °C. Individual fly ash particles were characterized by a monomodal size distribution (PSD) of spherical particles with smooth surfaces (SEM, TEM, AFM), and a mean particle size of 4. 6 μm (PSD). The BET active surface area of this sample was 1. 52 m 2 /g and the chemical composition of the fly ash surface (AES, XPS) was significantly different from the bulk composition and varied considerably between spheres. Many properties of the sample (e. g. spherical morphology, small particle size, thermal stability) appeared to be suitable for its applicability as filler in polymers, although the wide variation in surface composition between individual particles may challenge the development of a suitable surface modification technique. The observation that the bulk and surface compositions of the particles were so intrinsically different, strongly suggested that surface characterization is important when considering compatibility between matrices when applying fly ash as filler in polymers...|$|E
40|$|The South African {{coal mining}} {{industry}} generates {{large volumes of}} coal ultrafine waste (< 150 microns) each year, with a significant amount being dumped in tailing slurry dams. These slurry dams {{have been associated with}} prolonged pollution and loss of valuable resources. In the two stage flotation process developed at the University of Cape Town, froth flotation is used to both recover coal (stage 1) and remove pyritic sulfur (stage 2) from <b>ultrafine</b> <b>coal</b> waste, resulting in three outputs streams: a saleable coal product, a small volume sulfide-rich stream, and a reduced volume sulfide lean tailings stream. Pre-disposal removal of sulfide sulfur and coal recovery by means of froth flotation is aimed at effectively removing the acid rock drainage (ARD) risk associated with sulfide bearing waste s and at recovering valuable resources respectively. Previous studies have demonstrated the technical feasibility of this process for a number of coal waste types on a laboratory-scale, with results indicating {{that it is possible to}} recover large quantities of useable coal whilst generating a tailings waste stream with a reduced sulfur content and negligible ARD risk. An order of magnitude financial model for a fictitious plant has also been developed, and applied to demonstrate the economic viability for s elected case studies. To date, however, studies on the environmental viability of the process have only focused on the ARD mitigating potential of the two-stage flotation process and little attention has been given to the systemic environmental implication s of the process such as the energy and reagent usage. The research study therefore aims to evaluate the environmental burdens and benefits of the two-stage flotation process, particularly from a South African context, and to compare the environmental performance to the conventional disposal of untreated coal ultrafines. Furthermore, this project aims to establish which stages along the process contribute the most to the environmental burdens of the process and how the variations of the input parameters affect the overall environmental performance of the proposed process. To this end, a life cycle inventory of inputs and outputs was compiled on the basis of the empirical results derived from a previous laboratory-scale case study conducted on a sample of an acid generating <b>ultrafine</b> <b>coal</b> waste from the Waterberg region. Experimental results from the case study, which entailed two-stage flotation (using Naflote 9858 as a coal collector and xanthate (SIBX) as a sulfide collector in stages 1 and 2), and detailed characterisation of the feed and desulfurised tailings, was supplemented with literature information and data from mass and energy balance calculations for a fictitious plant. An environmental impact analysis was subsequently conducted using a combination of Life Cycle Impact Assessment and risk-based impact assessment techniques and criteria. The impact categories selected included climate change, terrestrial acidification, fossil fuel depletion, natural land transformation, aquatic water pollution risk, drinking water quality risk, aqueous acidification, salinity and consumptive water footprint. Aquatic water pollution risk, drinking water quality risk and aqueous acidification impact indicators were calculated by summing up risk potential factors for the constituents of the final disposed waste streams. The rest of the impact categories were calculated by multiplying the inventory result with a characterisation factor developed from impact assessment models The case study results indicated that the simple mentation of the two-stage flotation process results in a notable decrease in eco-toxicity, salinity, consumptive water footprint, metal toxicity, aqueous acidification, fossil fuel depletion and natural land transformation impacts. However, the results al so indicated an increase in atmospheric related impacts (climate change and terrestrial acidification impacts), which has been attributed to the additional energy consumption associated with the two-stage flotation process and the production processes associated with the flotation reagents. Analyses of the process contributions to the individual impact categories for the two-stage flotation process revealed the climate change and terrestrial acidification impact categories to be dominated by the electricity production process and the flotation reagents production process. The sensitivity analyses revealed a higher dependence of the fossil fuel depletion impact category on the percentage coal yield than the electricity consumption of the foreground process. Furthermore the sensitivity analyses indicated a strong dependence of the climate change and terrestrial acidification impacts on the electricity consumption and the SIBX dosage in the foreground process. In the South African context, implementation the two-stage flotation process would result in a significant recovery of coal (approximately 1. 2 million tonnes for every 4 million tonnes dry coal ultrafines lost per annum) and a sulfide-rich product which can be utilised for electricity production and sulfuric acid production respectively, hence promoting resource efficiency. Although higher than in the case of conventional land disposal, the energy used in the two-stage flotation process is infinitesimal compared to the energy recovered in the process through the generation of additional coal, and results in only a 0. 025 % increase in the annual greenhouse gas emissions. The implementation of the two-stage flotation would also result in reduced water losses in comparison to conventional land disposal, which is beneficial in the South African context as South Africa is a water scarce region. Lastly whilst the implementation of the two-stage flotation process would result in the reduction of water related impacts associated with acidification, salinization and metal pollution, it might pose a further threat to aquatic life if the xanthate salt reagents are emitted to local water sources. The limitations of the study were mainly associated with the quality of the input and output data, the impact categories and the system boundary and scenario development. The multiple sources of information and the variations in literature of the energy input estimates were noted as a source of uncertainty. The lack of characterisation factors for some of the substances in the system as well as the exclusion of the possibility of utilization of the sulfide-lean stream were also part of the limitations associated with the study. Recommendations for future work include improving the environmental assessment by incorporating various case studies and by incorporating downstream processing as well as optimizing the two-stage flotation process by using less energy and by using less toxic flotation reagents...|$|E
40|$|The main {{research}} {{objective is to}} determine the effect of coal-water fuel (CWF) treatment on atomization quality when applied to an <b>ultrafine</b> <b>coal</b> water fuel (solids loading - 50 %) and at elevated pressures. The fuel treatment techniques are expected to produce secondary atomization, i. e., disruptive shattering of CWF droplets subsequent to their leaving the atomizing nozzle. Upon combustion, the finer fuel droplets would then yield better burnout and finer fly ash size distribution, which in turn could reduce problems of turbine blade erosion. The parallel objective was to present quantitative information on the spray characteristics of CWF (average droplet size and spray shape and angle) with and without fuel treatment for purposes of application to the design of CWF-burning gas turbine combustors. The experiments include laser diffraction droplet size measurements and high speed photographic studies of CWF sprays in the MIT Spray Test Facility to determine mean droplet size (mass median diameter), droplet size distribution, and spray shape and angle. For the spray tests at elevated pressures, pressure vessels were constructed and installed in the spray test rig. For support of data analyses, a capillary tube viscometer was used to measure the CWF viscosity at the high shear rate that occurs in an atomizer (> 104 sec'). A semi-empirical relationship was developed giving the CWF spray droplet size {{as a function of the}} characteristic dimensionless parameters of twin-fluid atomization, including the Weber number, the Reynolds number, and the air-to-fuel mass flow ratio. The correlation was tested experimentally and good agreement was found between calculated and measured drop sizes when the high shear viscosity of the CWF was used in the semi-empirical equation. Water and CWF spray tests at elevated pressure were made. Average droplet sizes measured as a function of atomizing air-to-fuel ratios (AFRs) at various chamber pressures show that the droplet mass median diameter (MMD) decreases with increasing AFR at a given chamber pressure and increases with increasing chamber pressure at a given AFR. In particular, the results show that droplet sizes of CWF sprays decrease with increasing chamber pressure if the atomizing air velocity is held constant. Of the fuel treatment techniques investigated, the heating of CWF (flash-atomization) was found to be very effective in reducing droplet size, not only at atmospheric pressure but also at elevated pressure. Secondary atomization by C 02 absorption (used in a previous study) had given favorable results on CWF combustion, but in this present case this fuel treatment did not seem to have any observable effect on the drop size distribution of the CWF spray at room temperature. The spray angle was observed to reduce with increasing chamber pressure for given atomizing conditions (AFR, fuel flow rate, fuel temperature). The decreasing entrainment rate per unit length of spray with increasing chamber pressure was mainly responsible for the reduction of the spray angle. The heating of the CWF increased the spray angle, both at atmospheric and elevated pressures. A model was developed to predict spray angle change for the effects of the flash-atomization as a function of AFR, fuel flow rate, and the superheat of the water...|$|E
