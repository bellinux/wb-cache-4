40|$|Recently, new {{processes}} to produce enhanced boiling surfaces have been developed. Those are extrusion, {{a combination of}} extrusion and chipping, mechanical rolling, hydraulic expansion, and sintering of metal powder, all of which involve complex operations and high production costs. Grooved rolling is introduced as a simple process to form enhanced boiling surfaces. First, the deformation caused by grooved rolling was analysed by applying a visioplasticity method with plasticine model rolling. Characteristic deformations using the grooved rolling technique occur {{in the form of}} a continuous indentation by the teeth of the grooved roll to the surface of a plane sheet or strip, deformation is mainly confined to the region between the teeth of the <b>upper</b> <b>grooved</b> roll and lower flat roll, plastic flow of the work occurs mainly in a longitudinally and the tips of rib projections formed by grooved rolling are rounded. Second, grooved rolling of thin aluminum and copper strips was examined and it was found that 1 mm pitch grooves can be formed on the strip surfaces successfully. Finally, three-stand tandem mill, by which longitudinal grooving, additional 45 degree cross grooving, and flattening and trimming of the rounded tips of the rib projections could be performed, was introduced as a test system, and some examples of products were obtained by the system. ...|$|R

50|$|The brown tree snake is a generalist feeder {{known to}} eat {{a wide variety of}} foods, when {{threatened}} is highly aggressive and tends to lunge and strike the aggressor repeatedly. The snake has numerous teeth but only the last two {{on each side of the}} <b>upper</b> jaw have <b>grooves,</b> which inject venom as it bites. Therefore, the snake’s mouth must be opened as wide as possible to insert and expose their fangs. A chewing movement is used by the snake to inject the venom by means of capillary action along the grooved fangs. The venom is used to subdue and kill prey on which the snake feeds; however, the venom is not considered dangerous to adult humans. In addition to subduing its victim with its venom, the brown tree snake often wraps its body around the prey, like a constrictor, to immobilize the prey while chewing and consuming the animal.|$|R
50|$|Most proborhyaenids had a robust, hyena-like skull, {{although}} one species, Callistoe vincei, had an elongate, narrow skull more {{reminiscent of a}} thylacine. The teeth were strongly specialized as carnassials for eating meat, and in Arminiheringia rotated throughout the animal's life to maintain a continuous shearing blade on the tooth. Preserved specimens of their canines lack enamel; in life, the enamel may have been very thin or restricted to the tooth tips. In the genus Arminiheringia the lower canines are protruding. Proborhyaenids can be distinguished from other sparassodonts by their <b>grooved</b> <b>upper</b> and lower canines, which grew continuously throughout the animals' lives like rodent incisors. Bond and Pascual (1983) argued that proborhyaenid canines stopped growing in late adulthood based on a specimen from Mendoza Province, Argentina, but the proborhyaenid identity of this specimen is disputed. The presence of open-rooted upper canines in thylacosmilids {{has led to the}} suggestion that proborhyaenids are closely related to, or even ancestral to, this group, but this is still controversial.|$|R

50|$|There {{are about}} fifty-nine {{members of the}} family Heteromyidae divided among six genera. They are all small rodents, the largest being the giant {{kangaroo}} rat (Dipodomys ingens) with a body length of 15 cm and a tail a little longer than this. In many species the tail is tufted and is mainly used for balance. Other adaptations include partially fused vertebrae in the neck, short fore limbs and much enlarged bullae (bubble-shaped bones in the skull). The skulls vary widely across the group but they are all thin and papery and do not have the robust cranial crests and ridges found on the skulls of {{members of the family}} Geomyidae. The skull has other peculiarities. There is an extra hole that penetrates the rostrum, distinctive occluded teeth and the masseter muscle, which moves the lower jaw, is set far forward on the snout, an arrangement found in squirrels, beavers, pocket gophers, heteromyids and a few other groups. The dental formula is 1/1, 0/0, 1/1, 3/3 making twenty teeth in total. In the kangaroo rats, the teeth continue to grow all the time, being worn away as the animal chews. The molars have two-lobed cusps. The <b>upper</b> incisors are <b>grooved</b> and the enamel on the molars is quickly worn away by chewing leaving the dentine exposed.

40|$|Introduction: {{the many}} causes of facial paralysis, {{unilateral}} or bilateral, the great master is Bell's palsy or idiopathic (40 - 75 %). Melkersson (1928) and Rosenthal (1930) described this syndrome, still of unknown etiology, some authors support the autoimmune hypothesis (improvement with corticosteroids), the infectious, or genetic (changes {{in the short}} arm of chromosome 9). The estimated general population prevalence of 0. 08 %, no differences were significant between sex or ethnicity. This syndrome can bring in 25 - 40 % of the time, orofacial edema, tongue and facial paralysis plicata unilateral or bilateral, being the most frequent oligosymptomatic. Methods: Patient 68 years, seen repeatedly in emergency visits for lingual edema, hyposmia and vomiting episodes in recent months. The patient eventually admitted to ENT for filing plant facial palsy and facial edema 36 hours of evolution. Upon examination revealed the presence of fibrous lingual <b>grooves,</b> <b>upper</b> and lower lip edema and left peripheral facial paralysis (in the House-Brackmann classification (5 / 6). Results: Analytical and requested a chest radiograph as first tests of diagnostic orientation. Analytical data include a slight eosinophilia in complement levels and normal chest radiograph (without hilar lymphadenopathy). Tongue biopsies were taken to confirm the diagnosis by pathology (noncaseating granulomas). Intravenous corticosteroids were administered and measures of ocular occlusion (blockage epitelizant cream and eye). Subsequent studies were performed, such as ENG and EMG to check {{the status of the}} facial nerve. Discussion: This kind of picture may be associated with more general symptoms that may mislead and give us a bad diagnostic orientation. Facial edema is a sign of the triad most frequent (65 %) and that tends to appear, hence the unusual case. Can relapses of their symptoms on multiple occasions. The diagnosis is clinical and confirmation is obtained through the pathology (noncaseating granulomas). Outstanding scholar with thalidomide, with good results but in the process of acceptance...|$|R
40|$|Characterizing {{the piston}} ring {{behavior}} is inherently {{associated with the}} oil consumption, friction, wear and blow-by in internal combustion engines. This behavior varies along the ring's circumference and determining these variations is of utmost importance for developing ring-packs achieving desired performances in terms of sealing and conformability. This study based on straight beam model was already developed but does not consider the lubrication sub-models, the tip gap effects and the characterization of the ring free shape based on any final closed shape. In this work, three numerical curved beam based models were developed to study {{the performance of the}} piston ring-pack. The conformability model was developed to characterize the behavior of the ring within the engine. In this model, the curved beam model is adopted with considering ring-bore and ring-groove interactions. This interactions include asperity and lubrication forces. Besides, gas forces are included to the model along with the inertia and initial ring tangential load. In this model we also allow for bore, <b>groove</b> <b>upper</b> and lower flanks thermal distortion. We also take into account the thermal expansion effect of the ring and the temperature gradient from inner diameter (ID) to outer diameter (OD) effects. The piston secondary motion and the variation of oil viscosity on the liner with its temperature in addition to the existence of fuel and the different hydrodynamic cases (Partially and fully flooded cases) are considered as well. This model revealed the ring position relative to the groove depending on the friction, inertia and gas pressures. It also characterizes the effect of non-uniform oil distribution on the liner and groove flanks. Finally, the ring gap position within a distorted bore also reveals the sealing performance of the ring. Using the curved beam model we also developed a module determining the twist calculation under fix ID or OD constraint. The static twist is an experimental characterization of the ring during which the user taps on the ring till there is a minimum clearance between the ring lowest point and the lower plate all over the ring's circumference but without any force contact. Our last model includes four sub-models that relate the ring free shape, its final shape when subjected to a constant radial pressure (this final shape is called ovality) and the force distribution in circular bore. Knowing one of these distribution, this model determines the other two. This tool is useful {{in the sense that the}} characterization of the ring is carried out by measuring its ovality which is more accurate than measuring its free shape or force distribution in circular bore. Thus, having a model that takes the ovality as an input is more convenient and useful based on the experiments carried out to characterize the ring. by Mohamed Aziz Bhouri. Thesis: S.

40|$|As I {{wrote my}} paper on Sciurus (Rheithrosciurus) microtis, see Notes from the Leyden Museum, Part I, 1879, p. 40, I knew Rheithrosciurus macrotis {{only from the}} both short {{annotations}} of the late Gray about that Squirrel. I here verbally copie his descriptions: Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond. 1856, p. 341, pl. XLVI, he writes: »Among the specimens of animals which the British Museum has lately received from Mr. Wallace from Sarawak, is a large, well-marked species of Squirrel, particular for having very large, longish pencilled ears like the European species, with a broad white streak on {{the upper part of}} each side, and a very broad full tail, grisled, with large white tips to the hairs. Sciurus macrotis. Ears large, with large pencil of elongate hairs. Dark chestnut-brown, very minutely grisled with pale tips to the hairs. Rump, outside of thighs and base of tail redder; point of thighs bright bay; feet blackish; upper part of the side with a broad pale streak; cheeks and inner side of legs paler; chin, throat, and beneath white; tail very broad, with very long white-tipped hairs. Length 13, tail 11 = 24 inches. Hab. Sarawak (Mr. Wallace). ” — and: Ann. and Mag. of Nat. Hist. 1867, p. 271, we read: »The front edge of the cutting-teeth broad, rounded, closely longitudinally grooved. Rheithrosciurus nov. gen. Head large, compressed, short; ears large, with a pencil of elongated hairs at the tip; cutting-teeth broad, rounded in front and closely longitudinally grooved. The limbs free; feet large, strong. Tail as long as the body and head, very thick, clavate, covered with long flaccid hairs. The grooving of the teeth is a pecularity not observed in any other Sciuridae. Rheithrosciurus macrotis. Brown, very minutely punctulated; throat and beneath white; lateral streaks broad, yellowish; front of thighs bay. Tail blackish, whitish washed. Hab. Sarawak (Wallace). Type in B. M. ” — In my above mentioned paper I already briefly showed that these descriptions are highly short and that they do not agree the one with the other. As I often before had seen Squirrels with <b>grooved</b> <b>upper</b> cutting-teeth, that is to say, where those teeth are provided each with one or two grooves and while Gray in his first description entirely had overlooked this character, I thought that his words »cutting-teeth closely longitudinally grooved” in his second note should be understood as only relating the upper ones, for squirrels with grooved lower cutting-teeth were not known. In my opinion now the <b>grooving</b> of the <b>upper</b> cutting-teeth in squirrels has no generic value, but my Saleyer squirrel presenting that character, I placed the latter in the neighborhood of Gray’s squirrel, but with Gray’s generic title Rheithrosciurus in Parenthesi. In doing so I only intented to fix the attention of the readers on the always excellent character of the grooved cuttingteeth in distinguishing species. Anderson in his »Yunnan-Expedition” says not a single word about the grooved character of the incisors, and he describes the squirrel as follows: »The head is large, compressed and short. The ears are large with a pencil of elongated hairs at their tips, the feet are large and strong and the sides of the animal are laterally banded. The general colour of the animal is dark-nutbrown, very minutely punctulated; the hind quarter, including the base of the tail and the outside of the fore- and hindlimbs bright bay; the feet blackish. There is a brownish band from the axilla to the groin, with a yellowish white band about it. The cheeks and inner sides of the limbs are pale brownish, grizzled and with long white tips to the hairs. Habitat. Sarawak. Borneo. ” Afterwards my friend Trouessart in his Catalogue des Mammifères vivants et fossiles 1880 p. 69 (12), united my microtis with Gray’s macrotis in the genus Rheithrosciurus Thereupon I wrote to Trouessart that I did not accept that genus, as there were still more squirrels which show the same character, but for the rest belong to the most different groups and I shortly explained why I had placed my squirrel in the neighborhood of Gray’s species. But I hardly can express my astonishment as I saw in the Paris Museum and afterwards in the British Museum specimens of Rheithrosciurus macrotis! Indeed it is the most splendid squirrel that I ever saw. The coloring of the body generally resembles that of Sciurus prevostii: like in that species each side is ornated with a broad white band. But the ears are longer than in any other squirrel, viz: 30 mm., they are embellished with a very long tuft measuring 45 mm., the whole ear with pencil also measures about 75 mm. The tail is very bushy and resembles that organ in Chirormjs madagascariensis; its length is about 280 mm. without tuft, while it measures the tuft included 292 mm., also much longer than the body (c. f. Gray’s measures above given), which measures the head included 235 mm. The hairs of the tail are long 92 mm., so that, if the hairs are spread out, the tail has a diameter of about 185 mm...|$|R
