The rooftop set that Trinity uses to escape from Agent Brown early in the film was left over from the production of Dark City, which has prompted comments due to the thematic similarities of the films.

Michael Jose Gonzalez, {{a writer}} for Gaffa, was appreciative that the singer chose not to follow the trends in the music {{industry}} and described the song as irresistible pop. Leahey from AllMusic felt that Oh Land's combination of spoken verses and disco worked together well. However, Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine found the track to be generic: [...] "while a song like 'Voodoo' could break Oh Land to a wider pop audience, it isn’t anything Little Boots or La Roux aren’t already doing." [...] Several reviewers were more critical of the song's lyrics. Drowned in Sounds John Calvert called the [...] "vocal hook [...] the year's most irksome".

30|$|The closet {{works to}} ours are in [16, 17] where many {{vehicles}} collect their congestion indices [16] or travelling times [17] on road segments and {{return them to}} a single-source vehicle to determine the path with shortest travelling time or least traffic congestion to a destination. Essentially, a source vehicle specifies routes of interest and broadcasts a query message. Each node in the routes of interest rebroadcasts the query at most once and keeps the reverse path entry to its immediate query sender. Each node then unicasts its congestion index or traveling time over the current road segment back to the source vehicle. So, the source vehicle can estimate the average congestion index or average travelling time of individual road segments and determine the best path. In [16], a node also caches the congestion index in a received unicast response message to prevent unnecessary rebroadcasts. Since all nodes must return the information directly to the source, the amount of overheads and collisions can become significant especially <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>lots</b> of query sessions or user traffic.|$|R
