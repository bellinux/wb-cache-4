These minerals can translocate and a method of easy identification is required. Because many of the minerals contain water and/or OH units the minerals lend themselves to NIR spectroscopy.

The work of all these scientists has shown that all elements found in nature with an atomic number greater than 83 (bismuth) are radioactive. Artificial radioactivity was first reported by I.

These scientists irradiated boron and aluminium targets with a particles from polonium and observed positrons emitted from the target even after removal of the a particle source. This discovery of induced or artificial radioactivity opened up a brand new field of tremendous importance. Around the same time, the discovery of the cyclotron, deuteron and neutron by various scientists facilitated the discovery of many more artificial radioactivities.

Consequently, the reduction was studied using perchlorate as a non-complexing anion and sulphate as a complexing anion. In HClO 4 solution, increasing the perchlorate concentration shifts to more positive potentials, which seem to correspond to junction potential effects. Increasing either HClO 4 or perchlorate concentrations increases the limiting current slightly, which {{can be attributed to}} a higher rate of disproportionation of U(V); other factors, e. g., viscosity of the solution, tend to counteract the effect of the disproportionation.

The effect of acid on the stability of the latter complex confirms its existence as an uncharged species.

40|$|A {{research}} report {{submitted to the}} Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science, Johannesburg, August, 2014. Efflorescent minerals are a common feature of the soil surface in seasonal environments where evapotranspiration (ET) exceeds precipitation (P), and are formed by the evaporation of salt solutions from the soil during periods of drying. On the Highveld gold fields, ET exceeds rainfall by approximately two-and-a-half times during the dry season, and soils overlying acid mine drainage and along polluted stream banks can become covered by distinctively coloured mineral efflorescent crusts. Whereas some efflorescent minerals are relatively insoluble and present a negligible environmental hazard (for example, gypsum), others may be readily soluble and contain high concentrations of potentially toxic metals (for example, copiapite, jarosite and <b>uranyl</b> <b>sulphate).</b> During periods of rainfall, such salts are washed further afield and into surface water bodies and act as sources of episodic pollution. The presence of some efflorescent minerals can be detected from their characteristic reflectance signatures using remote-sensing (RS) of the electromagnetic spectrum. The species of efflorescent minerals present is a useful indication of the spatial extent of sub-surface contamination, and also of the chemical conditions of the substrate, in particular the concentration of total dissolved solids, pH and redox conditions. The {{aim of this study}} was therefore to assess the use of remote-sensing on indicator efflorescent minerals as a cost-effective aid in the spatial mapping of acid rock-drainage polluted soils and water-bodies. This study describes the range of efflorescent crusts identified on different land-use areas and soil classes in a Highveld gold-mining region. Crusts were first measured in-situ under natural sunlight using a portable analytical spectral radiometer (ASD) as well as using X-ray diffraction (XRD). They were then dissolved in deionized water and the resulting salt solutions allowed to evaporate prior to analysis under controlled lighting conditions. Spectra were post-processed and compared with iv geological spectral reference libraries. The salt solutions were also analyzed for metal and sulphate content and the results were used to establish evaporation models from which mineral precipitation could be predicted. Minerals identified in the visible near-infra red (VNIR) region included iron oxides (hematite and goethite), and the sulphate mineral jarosite. In the short wave infra-red (SWIR) region clay minerals of the smectite group were dominant. Gypsum and Al-Mn-Mg-Na sulphate salts were identified in the SWIR region as mixtures occurring with clay minerals. Minerals identified in the VNIR-SWIR region were all confirmed by X-Ray diffraction (XRD). Upon dissolution, geochemical modeling revealed that gypsum and jarosite are the most common minerals expected to precipitate. The precipitation of gypsum and jarosite indicates persistent acidic conditions after dissolution of mineral salts. Gypsum and jarosite were also accurately identified by hyper-spectral spectroscopy and confirmed by XRD and geochemical modeling. Agreement between spectral interpreted minerals and geochemically precipitated mineral phases demonstrated the ability of hyper-spectral data in detecting efflorescence minerals on the soil surface. Using partial least squares regression (PLSR) combined with bootstrapping, reflectance spectrum was significantly correlated with geochemical variables...|$|E

To catalysis Organic Chemistry owes the Grignard reagents, which have been employed not only for a multitude of simpler syntheses {{but also for the}} more complex syntheses of carbohydrates (Paal. Ber, 1905, 38 1656; 1906, 39, 1301, 2823, 2827) Frankland and Twiss J. C. S. 1905, 87, 864), of terpenss (Perkin J. C. S. 1907, 91, 480, Hesse Ber. 1909, 42, 1127, Mills and Bain J. C. S. 1910, 97, 1866) and of organo-silicon compounds (Kipping J. C. S. 1901 to 1909). Pope and Peachy effected resolutions of tin compounds with its aid. Chlorination is effected catalytically by suitable carriers. The Friedel and Crafte reaction is effected also by suitable halides. Numerous condensations such as the Benzoin condensation, the Aldol condensation, the Claisen condensation, and also esterification are catalytically effected. Equilibria between dynamic isomerides, in racemisation, and in mutarotation, are promoted by catalysis. Technical chemistry has, through catalysis, reversed the economic standing of nations. Cases in point are the synthesis of indigo, a stage in which is the catalytic oxidation of Napthalene by Sulphuric acid and Mercury, and the manufacture of sulphuric acids, of Ammonia and of Nitrates. The manufacture of synthetic petrols, power alcohols, and the new utilisations of coal depend entirely upon catalysts for their successful functioning. Analytical chemistry employs catalysts in processes of gas absorption such as addition of <b>Uranyl</b> <b>Sulphate</b> to Sulphuric Acid in the absorption of Ethylene (Lebeau and Damiens Compt. Rand. 1913, 156, 557) or of Corrosive Sublimate to alhaline Pyrogallol to accelerate the absorption of Oxygen. (Stassana, Compt. Rend. Soc. Biol. 1905, 58, 96). Also in Oxidation, such as the permanganate titration of iron in the presence of Hydrochloric and of Manganese Salts (Kessler. Pogg. Am. 1863, 118, 48; 119, 225), or the ability of Ferrous Sulphate to promote interaction between Potassium Persilphate and Potassium Iodide (Price Z Phys. Chem. 1898, 27, 474); and Reduction as in the employment of a Zinc-Copper Couple for the reduction of Chlorates to Chlorates (Thorpe and Eccles J. C. S. 1873, 26, 541; Bothamley and Thompson Ibid 1888, 53, 164). Catalysts are also employed in Organic analysis, as for example the use of colloidal platinum metals to convert Halogen compounds into Hydrogenated products and Halogen acid in the presence of Hydrogen (Borshe and Heimburger, Ber. 1915, 48, 452, 850). In Inorganic Chemistry a large number of reactions are catalytically accelerated. One of the best known is the decomposition of Potassium Chlorate in the Presence of Manganese Dioxide. Numerous catalyses are cited in the work of Dhar. (Ann. Chim. 11, 130 - 223, 1919). Hydrogen peroxide, another example of classical importance in chemical kinetics is decomposed by numerous agents, such as glass wool, salts of heavy metals, colloidal platinum. In Electrochemistry one may cite such examples as the addition of Fluorides in the preparation of Persulphates or percarbonates, (Muller and Friedberger, Z. Elektrochem., 1902, 8, 230), or the use of Lead Peroxide anodes in the oxidation of Chromates to Dichromates (Z. Elektrochem, 1905, 11, 863). Para-nitrotoluene with platinum anodes yields p-nitro-benzoic acid almost quantitatively. An enormous number of reactions is accelerated by radiant energy, according to photo chemical laws. A typical example is the union of Hydrogen and Chlorine, whose mechanism has occupied the attention of numerous workers. The photocatalytic combination of carbon-monoxide and Chlorine, of Sulphur Dioxide and Chlorine, of saturated, unsaturated, and aromatic hydro-carbons, and of acids (much as Acetic acid) and Chlorine furnish still further examples. Such reactions are further sensitive to the presence of ordinary material catalysts or anti-catalysts (See Griffiths and McKeowan, (“Photochemistry” p. 626. ...|$|E
40|$|Brannerite, ideally UTi 2 O 6 is a {{refractory}} uranium mineral {{found in}} many uranium and rare earth element ore deposits around the world, including many in Australia. As brannerite is refractory, ores containing brannerite require more intense leaching conditions than typical uranium ores. Brannerite {{is the most common}} refractory uranium mineral, and the most important uranium ore mineral after uraninite (UO 2) and coffinite (U(SiO 4) 1 -x(OH) 4 x). Several high-brannerite uranium deposits in Australia remain un-developed, despite being discovered as early as the 1950 s. The aim {{of this study was to}} understand the leaching chemistry of brannerite in a variety of systems, starting with the conventional acidic ferric sulphate system and alternatives including the ferric chloride-hydrochloric acid system and the alkaline-carbonate system. The principal assumption is that an improved understanding of the leaching chemistry of brannerite will lead to more effective extraction processes, improving the extractions at existing mines, and enabling the development of new ones. Brannerite was found to undergo congruent dissolution in acid, contrary to the often-reported mechanism in which a titanium oxide coating forms on the surface. Phosphate released by gangue minerals such as apatite can cause the formation of this layer however. When leaching with acidic ferric solutions, sulphate media is superior to chloride media. Alkaline carbonate leaching was also found to be effective for brannerite leaching, albeit much slower than acid leaching. These same alkaline leaching conditions were applied to a sample of refractory uranium ore from Queensland high in acid soluble gangue and shown to be effective. These findings are discussed in detail below. A sample of brannerite from the Dieresis deposit in the Sierra Albarrana region of Spain was characterised in detail by XRD and SEM-EDX methods. The brannerite was found to be altered and metamict (rendered amorphous by self-irradiation), as is typical for brannerite. Many brannerite particles contained linear zones of titanium oxide surrounded by silicon enriched and uranium depleted brannerite, consistent with descriptions of naturally altered brannerite. These altered zones were more susceptible to leaching, regardless of the leaching conditions. All leached residues were analysed by the same methods to understand the changes taking place in the solid phase during leaching. This suggests that the extent of natural alteration influences the leachability of a particular brannerite. The leaching of brannerite was studied in acidic ferric sulphate media (0. 05 mol/L or 2. 8 g/L Fe 3 +) over a range of temperatures (25 - 96 °C) and acid concentrations (10 - 200 g/L H 2 SO 4) for five hours. Leached brannerite was pitted and corroded. The rate of leaching was strongly dependent on temperature and weakly dependent on acid concentration. At lower temperatures, brannerite dissolved incongruently in the early stages of leaching. At higher temperatures brannerite dissolved congruently for the entirety of the leaching experiment. The transition between these two mechanisms happened at lower temperatures when the acid concentration was higher. In the incongruent dissolution reaction, the activation energies for uranium and titanium release were 36 and 48 kJ/mol respectively. In the congruent dissolution process, the activation energy was 23 kJ/mol for both uranium and titanium dissolution. At high temperatures (> 75 °C) and low acid concentrations (< 25 g/L H 2 SO 4), the concentration of titanium dropped after the first hour of leaching and some secondary anatase (TiO 2) formed. This anatase was distinct from the anatase in the original material in that it contained iron and did not contain uranium, confirming that it formed during leaching. Ferric chloride and cupric sulphate lixiviants were studied over a similar range of temperatures and acid concentrations. As with the ferric sulphate leaching tests, the oxidising cation concentration was kept constant at 0. 05 mol/L. The leaching behaviour of brannerite in cupric sulphate media was quite similar to what was observed in ferric sulphate media; the rate of leaching was slightly lower than what was observed in ferric sulphate media under comparable conditions. In chloride media, the rate of leaching was slow compared to sulphate media at the same temperature and acid concentration. This suggests that the formation of stable uranium complexes is an important part of the dissolution process. <b>Uranyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> complexes are much stronger than uranyl chloride complexes. Certain leaching experiments were repeated with the addition of minerals commonly associated with brannerite to gain a clearer understanding of the effects of deleterious gangue. These experiments were run at the extremes and middle of the range of temperatures and acid concentrations studied. Ilmenite accelerated the precipitation of anatase while fluorite significantly increased the rate of uranium and titanium dissolution. Fluorapatite greatly reduced the rate of brannerite dissolution. These results showed a previously unknown interaction between phosphorus and titanium. Phosphate helped to initiate the formation of a titanium oxide coating on the leached brannerite, inhibiting the leaching reaction. Higher concentrations of sulphuric acid reduced these negative effects. Interestingly, phosphate improved the rate of leaching in chloride media, suggesting that chloride leaching may be a viable option when processing high-phosphate refractory uranium ores. Alkaline leaching may be an effective alternative processing option. While it is often reported that brannerite and similar minerals will not readily dissolve in alkaline media, leaching experiments with sodium carbonate based lixiviants showed that alkaline leaching of brannerite is possible. Compared with acid leaching, it is slow however. Uranium extractions of 83...|$|E
