2500|$|Another {{prominent}} {{proponent of}} unschooling is John Taylor Gatto, author of Dumbing <b>Us</b> <b>Down,</b> <b>The</b> Exhausted School, A Different Kind of Teacher, and Weapons of Mass Instruction. Gatto argues that public {{education is the}} primary tool of [...] "state controlled consciousness" [...] {{and serves as a}} prime illustration of the total institution — a social system which impels obedience to the state and quells free thinking or dissent.|$|E
2500|$|Schlafly {{believed}} the Republican Party should reject immigration reform proposals; she told Focus Today {{that it is}} a [...] "great myth" [...] that the GOP needs to reach out to Latinos in the United States. [...] "The people the Republicans should reach out to are the white votes, the white voters who didn’t vote in the last election. The propagandists are leading <b>us</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> wrong path ... here's not any evidence at all that these Hispanics coming in from Mexico will vote Republican." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{soldiers}} on the hill with the pack-horses began to fire on us. About this time all the Indians had got their horses and guns and bows and arrows and war-clubs and they charged the soldiers {{in the east and}} north on top of the hill. Custer was farther north than these soldiers were then. He was going to attack {{the lower end of the}} village. We drove nearly all that got away from <b>us</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hill along the ridge where another lot of soldiers were trying to make a stand." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pointing to the Statute of Monopolies and {{the public}} hostility to the [...] "odious monopolies," [...] he {{concluded}} that when Congress enacted the first patent statute (in language substantially unchanged to this day in regard to patent-eligibility), Congress {{did not want the}} system to allow patents on methods of conducting trade. State Street was a grave error. [...] "Before State Street led <b>us</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> wrong path, this court had rightly concluded that patents were designed to protect technological innovations, not ideas about the best way to run a business." ...|$|E
2500|$|For Squad 5-O, {{the move}} to Tooth and Nail {{was more than just}} a change of {{approach}} in musical style. The band also began to move away from explicit references to Jesus, and to use metaphor more extensively. They also began to tour in more mainstream venues than churches, as explained by Jeff Fortson: [...] "Jesus said to be fishers of men; we have realized that you can't do that unless you're where the people who need him are." [...] Generally, the band was discontented with the state of the Christian music industry and Christian subculture, which they saw as exploitive and misleading. Jeff Fortson contrasted for HM magazine their experiences playing at a [...] "large Christian event" [...] and a secular one a few days later. At the Christian event (which was headlined by Steven Curtis Chapman) [...] "... the kids were coming out of the seats and standing in the aisles to come up and rock out with us... They just shut <b>us</b> <b>down...</b> <b>The</b> park security and promoters evidently thought we were just evil and inciting riots." [...] At the secular show they reported that they could [...] "...connect with the kids, you know, just be real... same exact response from the crowd, and that's why I feel that's where we belong." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 23 June 1986, Paisley and 21 other unionist {{politicians}} {{occupied the}} Stormont Parliament Building in protest at the Agreement, while 200 supporters protested outside and clashed with police. Paisley {{and the others}} were forcibly removed by police the next day. He shouted at police officers: [...] "Don't come crying to me if your homes are attacked. You will reap what you sow!" [...] During the campaign against the Agreement, loyalist militants attacked the homes of over 500 police officers, forcing 150 families to move. That evening, he addressed an Ulster Clubs rally in Larne and warned:If the British government force <b>us</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> road to a united Ireland we will fight to the death! [...] This could come to hand-to-hand fighting in every street in Northern Ireland. We {{are on the verge of}} civil war [...] We are asking people to be ready for the worst and I will lead them. On 10 July, Paisley and deputy DUP leader Peter Robinson led 4,000 loyalists in an early morning protest in which they 'took over' and 'occupied' the town of Hillsborough in protest against the Agreement. Hillsborough Castle is where the Agreement had been signed. One month later, Robinson led a loyalist invasion of the village of Clontibret in the Republic of Ireland. Robinson was arrested and charged for his part in the incident. Paisley and many loyalist supporters travelled south to support him during his court appearance in Dundalk. Their singing of loyalist songs outside the courthouse led to rioting, causing Paisley and Robinson to lodge a formal complaint with the Foreign Office about what they said was inadequate protection.|$|E

60|$|A steam-tug, the Goliath, now took {{us by the}} arm, and gallanted <b>us</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> river {{past the}} fort.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We're evidently in {{the middle}} of a fleet,' said Keller quietly. 'If one doesn't run <b>us</b> <b>down,</b> <b>the</b> other will. Phew! What in {{creation}} is that?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, Mr Charles," [...] said Jacques, {{shaking his}} head, [...] "that {{was not well}} done; an inch more would have sent <b>us</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> rapids like drowned cats." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will follow}} this," [...] Dave said; [...] "it {{is the right}} {{direction}} anyhow, and it is as likely to take <b>us</b> <b>down</b> into <b>the</b> valleys again in time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} there is any chance of their attacking <b>us</b> to-night, <b>down</b> <b>the</b> slopes, as they did this morning?" [...] Tom asked Mr Harvey.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said another, [...] "we'll {{take it as}} fair payment, {{for having}} made <b>us</b> drop <b>down</b> <b>the</b> current again to let her ladyship pass." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's Father a-standing at the yard-gate," [...] said Martin Poyser. [...] "I reckon {{he wants}} to watch <b>us</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> field. It's {{wonderful}} what sight he has, and him turned seventy-five." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shan't {{play any}} game on you. Just {{say what you}} want done and I'll help you all I can--providing that launch takes <b>us</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> river as quick as it can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The wind {{will carry}} <b>us</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> lake," [...] said Giant, who {{appeared}} to suffer the least of all. [...] "But I say, boys, all of our guns are gone, and other things, too!" ...|$|E
60|$|At noon, {{we hired}} a Kanaka to take <b>us</b> <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> ancient ruins at Honaunan in his canoe--price two dollars--reasonable enough, for a sea voyage of eight miles, {{counting}} both ways.|$|R
6000|$|... “Didn’t get the chance. The car was crowded, {{and before}} we could get to Jasniff and Merwell they saw <b>us,</b> ran <b>down</b> <b>the</b> aisle the other way, and got off.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't we {{get close}} to the yacht?" [...] {{suggested}} Sam. [...] "See, the sky is clouding over. I don't believe they will see <b>us</b> going <b>down</b> <b>the</b> stairs." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was just}} then I {{heard a sound}} behind me, and turning my head I saw Quilla {{stumbling}} towards <b>us</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> stony slope as best her half-blind eyes would let her, and crying as she came: ...|$|E
6000|$|But in {{a minute}} he came after <b>us</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> street without any hat, and with his long hair all blown about, and stopped us, saying fervently, [...] "Miss Summerson, upon my honour and soul, you may depend upon me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|I don’t {{know what}} answer I could have made. I imagine Dominic thought himself unanswerable. As {{a matter of}} fact, before I could speak, a voice came to <b>us</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> face of the rock crying secretly, “Olà, down there! All is safe ashore.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It don't {{take much}} drinking, this, General," [...] she remarked, cheerily {{draining}} her glass! [...] "Different to the 'pop' they give <b>us</b> <b>down</b> at <b>the</b> 'Star,' eh, Flossie? Good old gooseberry I call that!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So he is," [...] {{answered}} Frank. [...] "You wouldn't catch old Crabtree acting that way. He'd {{have bad}} every cadet {{out of bed}} and sent half a dozen of <b>us</b> <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> guard-room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I must only {{stay for}} a moment, Douglas," [...] she said, gravely. [...] "Let <b>us</b> go <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hill by the Beacon. We shall {{be on the way}} home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To-day's Friday: we're off on Wednesday {{with any}} luck. Will you come this way?" [...] He led <b>us</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> {{companion}} {{to a dark}} hole which he called the saloon. [...] "Names? What! are you Mr. Treffry? Then we're partners!" [...] A schoolboy's glee came on his face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bless you, yes. Why, that {{dirty little}} gutter, you know, that {{ran along the}} side of the road and {{followed}} <b>us</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hill all the way here, that cost them--let me see--yes, nearly sixty thousand dollars. And fancy! papa's just condemned it--says it won't do; and they've got to build another." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} well enough," [...] Dick panted; [...] "but I {{did it on}} purpose. We will turn and work round again. They will hear, from the villagers, that we have come this way, and will be {{following}} <b>us</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> road while we are making {{our way back to}} the ghauts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let <b>us</b> move <b>down</b> <b>the</b> lake," [...] {{suggested}} Shep. [...] "We can't {{go straight}} across. We {{can come up}} again on the other shore---if the wind will let us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{shortest}} is up the crag by the Stairs or {{the gully}} {{on the other}} side. The regular track takes <b>us</b> <b>down</b> near <b>the</b> bottom of the next dale, and then back over the top." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, Paolo. You {{were but}} just in time. The fellow was too strong for me. Now let <b>us</b> slip <b>down</b> <b>the</b> inside of the wall as quickly as possible." ...|$|R
