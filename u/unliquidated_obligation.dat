40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedOn July 1, 1995, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service fielded the On-line Prevalidation System for processing vendor payment requests. Its {{purpose was to}} prevent new Negative <b>Unliquidated</b> <b>Obligation</b> and Unmatched Disbursements records by comparing disbursement requests to obligations prior to payment. The Objectives of this thesis were to determine the causes of rejected payment requests by analyzing sample data drawn from Marine Corps Forces, Atlantic's Operations and Maintenance appropriation and to recommend {{ways to improve the}} prevalidation process so that obligation validation is more efficient and effective. Research included an investigation into the background of the prevalidation system and an analysis of UMDs and NULOs before and after the implementation of the OPV System. Seven causes of rejected payment requests were identified, along with the penalty interest charged as a result of document numbers remaining on the Rejected Payment Authorization Request Report. It was observed that the formation of new UMDs and NULOs has decreased as a result of OPV's implementation. While the disbursements that are prevalidated generally do not result in problem disbursements, only a portion of all disbursements is prevalidated. Lowering thresholds at which disbursements must be prevalidated and expanding the types of payments that are subject to prevalidation will improve the credibility of DoD financial management and further decrease problem disbursement levels.

In addition, inaccurate obligation data result in misstatement of budgetary information.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this audit was to {{evaluate}} the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) process for reviewing unliquidated interagency agreement (IA) obligations, deobligating funds, and closing IAs. The objectives of our review were to determine: (1) whether EPA has adequate controls in place to identify and deobligate unneeded IA funds, and (2) the amount of obligations under IAs that could potentially be deobligated. Background An IA is a written agreement between federal agencies in which one agency provides goods or services to another agency on a reimbursable basis. It is EPA’s policy to close all IAs within 270 days after the project period expires. As part of close-out, <b>unliquidated</b> <b>obligations</b> should be deobligated so that the funds {{can be used for}} other purposes. For further information...|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} aimed at {{determining}} the level of efficiency {{in the use of}} the State property and allocating the major shortcomings and threats by analyzing regularities and tendencies in the financial indicators of the State-owned enterprises. A retrospective analysis of the process of development of the public sector together with the efficiency of its management in Ukraine has been presented. There is a tendency towards improving the financial indicators of performance of the State-owned enterprises while reducing their number. At the same time, there is a high rate of unprofitableness of the State-owned enterprises, large amounts of <b>unliquidated</b> <b>obligations,</b> a relatively low income in the budget compared with the indicators of financing and maintaining these enterprises. A parallel with the world practice has been drawn to discover that world-wide a large number of enterprises with the State share in the administration have fairly high dynamics of of financial performance. The main problems that cause the unsatisfactory status of property and the functioning of the State-owned enterprises have been identified...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{identify}} and analyze the causes of negative <b>unliquidated</b> <b>obligations</b> (NULO) in the O&M, MC appropriation, using sample data drawn from Marine Corps Base, Camp Pendleton, California. NULOs exist when recorded expenditures (liquidations) exceed amounts obligated. As such, NULOs represent out-of-balance conditions that should not have occurred. NULOs {{were found to be}} correlated with unmatched disbursements, specific transaction types (USMC Standard Accounting, Budgeting and Reporting System (SABRS) Document Identifier Codes 'XSI' and 'XRA'), and contracts containing multiple Contract Line Item Numbers. The thesis categorized causes as either fund administrator errors or disbursing errors. Eighty-eight percent of NULOs were attributable to fund administrators failure to record obligations initially, or only partially, and erroneous adjustments to recorded obligations. SABRS' internal controls were found to be only partially effective due to their reliance upon data elements that were incorrectly or incompletely input into SABRS and other accounting procedural weaknesses. NULOs remained uncorrected {{due to a lack of}} management reports detailing NULOs and fund administrators' failure to use existing management exception reports to identify and correct NULOs. NANAU.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In September 2000, the U. S. Census Bureau told Congress that it had at least $ 305 million in budget savings out of its $ 4. 5 billion fiscal year 2000 no-year appropriations for the 2000 decennial census. Of the $ 4. 5 billion appropriated to the U. S. Census Bureau in fiscal year 2000, lower-than-expected expenditures and obligations resulted in available balances of at least $ 415 million. A lower-than-expected support staff workload reduced salary and benefit costs by about $ 348 million. Enumerator workload is largely determined by the initial mail response rate for returned census questionnaires. The initial mail response of 64 percent meant that Census enumerators {{did not have to}} visit more than three million American households. However, the available balances from the higher mail response rate and the lower support staff workload were partially offset by about $ 100 million of higher salary and benefit costs for enumerators, including a higher workload for unanticipated recounts. According to Bureau data, enumerator productivity did not significantly affect budget variances for the 2000 decennial census. The Bureau reported the national average time to visit a household and complete a census questionnaire was about the one hour estimated. Because of significant internal control weaknesses, the Bureau was unable to develop and report complete, accurate, and timely information for managing decision-making. Specific control weaknesses for fiscal year 2000 were related to the lack of controls over financial reporting and financial management systems. Financial reporting issues included (1) the inability to produce accurate and timely financial statements and other financial management reports needed for oversight and day-to-day management; (2) the lack of timely and complete reconciliations needed to validate the balances of key accounts; and (3) unsupported and inaccurate reported balances for accounts payable and undelivered orders [...] two key accounts needed to manage and report on <b>unliquidated</b> <b>obligations.</b> ...|$|R
