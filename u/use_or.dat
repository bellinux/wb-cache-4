5|$|In the Philosophie Zoologique, Lamarck {{proposed}} that species could acquire new characteristics from influences in their environment, in two rules that he named as laws. His first law stated that <b>use</b> <b>or</b> disuse of a body's structures would {{cause them to}} grow or shrink {{in the course of}} several generations. His second law held that any changes made in this way would be inherited. Together, Lamarck's laws imply the steady adaptation of animals to their environments.|$|E
5|$|In the book, Lamarck named two {{supposed}} {{laws that}} would enable animal species to acquire characteristics {{under the influence of}} the environment. The first law stated that <b>use</b> <b>or</b> disuse would cause body structures to grow or shrink over the generations. The second law asserted that such changes would be inherited. Those conditions together imply that species continuously change by adaptation to their environments, forming a branching series of evolutionary paths.|$|E

5|$|A kilim is an Islamic flatwoven carpet (without a pile), {{whether for}} {{household}} <b>use</b> <b>or</b> a prayer mat. The pattern {{is made by}} winding the weft threads back over the warp threads when a colour boundary is reached. This technique leaves a gap or vertical slit, so kilims are sometimes called slit-woven textiles. Kilims are often decorated with geometric patterns with 2- or 4-fold mirror or rotational symmetries. Because weaving uses vertical and horizontal threads, curves are difficult to generate, and patterns are accordingly formed mainly with straight edges. Kilim patterns are often characteristic of specific regions. Kilim motifs are often symbolic as well as decorative. For example, the wolf's mouth or wolf's foot motif (Turkish: Kurt Aǧzi, Kurt İzi) expresses the tribal weavers' desires for protection of their families' flocks from wolves.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial vaginosis (BV) occurs {{more often}} in lesbians, but it is unclear if BV is {{transmitted}} by sexual contact; it occurs in celibate as well as sexually active women.

Lesbians are not included in a category of frequency of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission, although transmission is possible through vaginal and cervical secretions.

5|$|Because {{language}} {{emerged in}} the early prehistory of man, before the existence of any written records, its early development has left no historical traces, and {{it is believed that}} no comparable processes can be observed today. Theories that stress continuity often look at animals to see if, for example, primates display any traits that can be seen as analogous to what pre-human language must have been like. And early human fossils can be inspected for traces of physical adaptation to language <b>use</b> <b>or</b> pre-linguistic forms of symbolic behaviour. Among the signs in human fossils that may suggest linguistic abilities are: the size of the brain relative to body mass, the presence of a larynx capable of advanced sound production and the nature of tools and other manufactured artifacts.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines possess sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, and amnesic actions, {{which are}} useful {{in a variety of}} {{indications}} such as alcohol dependence, seizures, anxiety disorders, panic, agitation, and insomnia. Most are administered orally; however, they can also be given intravenously, intramuscularly, or rectally. In general, benzodiazepines are well-tolerated and are safe and effective drugs in the short term {{for a wide range of}} conditions. Tolerance can develop to their effects and there is also a risk of dependence, and upon discontinuation a withdrawal syndrome may occur. These factors, combined with other possible secondary effects after prolonged use such as psychomotor, cognitive, or memory impairments, limit their long-term applicability. The effects of long-term <b>use</b> <b>or</b> misuse include the tendency to cause or worsen cognitive deficits, depression, and anxiety. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia recommends discontinuing the usage of benzodiazepines in those on opioids and those who have used them long term.|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin's {{grandfather}} Erasmus Darwin {{outlined a}} hypothesis of transmutation of {{species in the}} 1790s, and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck published a more developed theory in 1809. Both envisaged that spontaneous generation produced simple forms of life that progressively developed greater complexity, adapting to the environment by inheriting changes in adults caused by <b>use</b> <b>or</b> disuse. This process was later called Lamarckism. Lamarck thought there was an inherent progressive tendency driving organisms continuously towards greater complexity, in parallel but separate lineages with no extinction. Geoffroy contended that embryonic development recapitulated transformations of organisms in past eras when the environment acted on embryos, and that animal structures were determined by a constant plan as demonstrated by homologies. Georges Cuvier strongly disputed such ideas, holding that unrelated, fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs. His palæontological work in the 1790s had established the reality of extinction, which he explained by local catastrophes, followed by repopulation of the affected areas by other species.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the vast}} scope of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, many Malawian men believe that HIV {{contraction}} and death from AIDS are inevitable. Older men in particular often claim that the HIV/AIDS epidemic is a punishment issued by God or other supernatural forces. Other men refer to their own irresponsible sexual behaviors when explaining why they believe that death from AIDS is inevitable. These men sometimes claim that unprotected sex is natural (and therefore necessary and good) when justifying their lack of condom use during sex with extramarital partners. Finally, some men identify as HIV-positive without having undergone testing for HIV, preferring {{to believe that they}} have already been infected so they can avoid adopting undesirable preventative measures such as condom <b>use</b> <b>or</b> strict fidelity. Because of these fatalistic beliefs, many men continue engaging in extramarital sexual relations despite the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Malawi.|$|E
5|$|From these models, {{researchers}} also predict that bee populations will start declining most {{significantly in the}} southern latitudes with lagging range expansion in the north. Kerr and his colleagues found that as the climate has shifted, bumblebees {{have been forced to}} operate outside of their thermal ranges, causing range losses along the species’ southern limits. However, the study also found that while other flora and fauna have expanded their northerly ranges to account for the climate shifts, bumblebees have not expanded farther north. The most important findings in this study came from statistical models built to study whether or not these range shifts were due to confounding factors such as pesticide <b>use</b> <b>or</b> changes in land cover. The researchers found that climate change had the most meaningful impact on range shifts and bee distributions. To support these findings, the scientists note that failure for the bumblebee to respond to thermal changes and expand their northern range underscores the idea that bumblebees are susceptible to climate change.|$|E
5|$|Further {{charters}} {{show that}} the monastery at Reculver continued to benefit from Kentish kings in the 8th century, under abbots Heahberht (fl.748x762), Deneheah (fl.760) and Hwitred (fl.784), acquiring lands in Higham and Sheldwich and exemption from the toll due on one ship at Fordwich, and King Eadberht II of Kent {{was buried in the}} church in the 760s. Properties belonging to Reculver in the 7th and 8th centuries are indicated in passing by otherwise unrelated records, such as the estate at Higham, land probably in the High Weald area of Kent, from which iron may have been sourced for <b>use</b> <b>or</b> sale at or on behalf of Reculver, and an unidentified property named Dunwaling land in the district of Eastry. Such records also provide the names of other abbots of Reculver, namely Æthelmær (fl.699), Bære (fl.761x764), Æthelheah (fl.803), Dudeman (fl.805), Beornwine (fl.811x826), Baegmund (fl.832x839), Daegmund (fl.825x883) and Beornhelm (fl.867x905).|$|E

5|$|However, {{by then it}} {{had become}} clear that Frogner west of Solli plass would remain dominantly a {{residential}} area. The estimates showed that the station would capture few new riders and instead simply give a shorter walk for {{a small minority of}} those who used Nationaltheatret Station and Skøyen Station. With the upgraded Nationaltheatret Station, which opened in 1999, the capacity of the Oslo Tunnel increased from 16 to 24 trains per hour in each direction, because the station from then had four, rather than two, tracks. A similar upgrade would need to be done for Elisenberg Station, should it be taken into <b>use,</b> <b>or</b> the capacity of the tunnel would again be reduced. It is therefore highly unlikely that the station will ever be opened. In 1998, the readers of the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten proposed making Elisenberg an emergency exit.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{widespread}} use of antipsychotic drugs has long been controversial. There are several reasons for this. First, antipsychotic drugs are perceived as very aversive by people who have to take them, because they produce a general dullness of thought and suppress the ability to experience pleasure. Second, it is difficult to show that they act specifically against psychotic behaviors rather than merely suppressing all types of active behavior. Third, they can produce a range of serious side effects, including weight gain, diabetes, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, hormonal changes, and a type of serious movement disorder known as tardive dyskinesia. Some of these side effects may continue long after the cessation of drug <b>use,</b> <b>or</b> even permanently.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas with}} {{wet and dry}} seasons, soil {{nutrients}} diminish and erosion increases during the wet season. Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime.
