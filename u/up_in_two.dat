5|$|Having missed {{what could}} have been Chelsea's winning penalty, John Terry had to be consoled by his manager, Avram Grant. The Manchester United players formed a guard of honour for Chelsea, lining <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> {{opposite}} rows {{at the foot of the}} steps up to the presentation party and applauding as the Chelsea team – led by chief executive Peter Kenyon – walked through. As Didier Drogba had been sent off during the game, he was not allowed to collect his medal himself and it was given to Grant; when he returned to pitch level, Grant tossed his own medal into the crowd. After Chelsea's team received their medals, Munich air disaster survivor Bobby Charlton, who had captained United to the European Cup title in 1968, led his team up to collect their medals in his capacity as a club director. UEFA President Michel Platini presented both Kenyon and Charlton with commemorative plaques and medals, but Charlton declined to accept his medal; he later donated it to the club museum. When all the players had received their medals, Platini presented Manchester United with the trophy, which Rio Ferdinand – as team captain for the match – and Ryan Giggs – standing in for club captain Gary Neville – lifted together.|$|E
5|$|US Highway 2 (US2) is a {{component}} of the United States Numbered Highway System that connects Everett, Washington, to the Upper Peninsula (UP) of the US state of Michigan, with a separate segment that runs from Rouses Point, New York, to Houlton, Maine. In Michigan, the highway runs through the <b>UP</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> segments {{as a part of the}} state trunkline highway system, entering the state at Ironwood and ending at St. Ignace; in between, US2 briefly traverses the state of Wisconsin. As one of the major transportation arteries in the UP, US2 is a major conduit for traffic through the state and neighboring northern Midwest states. Two sections of the roadway are included as part of the Great Lakes Circle Tours, and other segments are listed as state-designated Pure Michigan Byways. There are several memorial highway designations and historic bridges along US2 that date to the 1910s and 1920s. The highway runs through rural sections of the UP, passing through two national and two state forests in the process.|$|E

25|$|The Battle of Saint-Dizier on 26 March 1814 was Napoleon's last victory, {{except for}} Ligny in 1815.

While Trelliard's division pursued Wintzingerode's main body northeast toward Bar-le-Duc. Lhéritier's division chased Friedrich Karl von Tettenborn's Cossacks west to Perthes. In the last muster on 15 April, Collaert's brigade in Lhéritier's division still included the 22nd and 25th Dragoons and counted 46 officers and 517 rank and file.

In the first line Pajol's Light, and Excelmaks' Heavy, Cavalry, formed the right wing, and Vandamme's Corps, the left; while Gérard's Corps which had not received the order to march until 09:30 arrived much later, and occupied the centre. 7th Division (Girard's) was detached some little distance on the extreme left the Imperial Guard and Milhaud's Corps of Cuirassiers constituted the second line.|$|E

Le Marchant noticed, looking through the trees of the wood his men were moving through, that French cavalry, drawn <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> deep columns of squadrons, were pushing the six squadrons of light dragoons back towards a narrow ravine flanked by stone walls. Le Marchant realised that an immediate charge was needed, before Ponsonby's squadrons were forced into the congested and broken ground to their rear.|$|E

25|$|About this time, the Light Cavalry Brigade of Colonel Makwitz, had {{completed}} his manoeuvre from the left, reached the right flank, and was formed <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> lines: also the four Battalions {{that had been}} detached from the 6th Brigade (General Krafft's), arrived upon the right of Saint-Amand-la-Haye, and came into action. The battle on both sides on {{this part of the}} Field continued to rage with unabated violence and with such indefatigable ardour did the Prussians continue the struggle, that when the fire of their skirmishers was observed to slacken, from the men having expended their ammunition, the soldiers of the 11th Hussars rushed into the midst of them, and supplied them with such cartridges as they had of their own; an act of devotion to which many of them fell a sacrifice.|$|E
25|$|She {{eventually}} deteriorated into {{a permanent}} state of detachment from reality. Thackeray desperately sought cures for her, but nothing worked, and she ended <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> different asylums {{in or near}} Paris until 1845, after which Thackeray took her back to England, where he installed her with a Mrs Bakewell at Camberwell. Isabella outlived her husband by 30 years, in the end being cared for by a family named Thompson in Leigh-on-Sea at Southend until her death in 1894. After his wife's illness Thackeray became a de facto widower, never establishing another permanent relationship. He did pursue other women, however, in particular Mrs Jane Brookfield and Sally Baxter. In 1851 Mr Brookfield barred Thackeray from further visits to or correspondence with Jane. Baxter, an American twenty years Thackeray's junior whom he met during a lecture tour in New York City in 1852, married another man in 1855.|$|E

25|$|The {{design of}} the Step Pyramid used royal cubits. The {{superstructure}} of the Step Pyramid is six steps/seven levels (including rooftop) and was built in six stages, {{as might be expected}} with an experimental structure. The pyramid began as a square mastaba (this designation as a mastaba is contended for several reasons) (M1) which was gradually enlarged, first evenly on all four sides (M2) and later just on the east side (M3). The mastaba was built <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> stages, first to form a four-stepped structure (P1) and then to form a six-stepped structure (P2), which now had a rectangular base on an east–west axis. The fact that the initial mastaba was square has led many to believe that the monument was never meant to be a mastaba, as no other known mastabas had ever been square. When the builders began to transform the mastaba into the four step pyramid, they made a major shift in construction. Like {{in the construction of the}} mastaba, they built a crude core of rough stones and then cased them in fine limestone with packing in between. The major difference is that in mastaba construction they laid horizontal courses, but for the pyramid layers, they built in accretion layers that leaned inwards, while using blocks that were both bigger and higher quality. Much of the rock for the pyramid was likely quarried from the construction of the great trench. It is widely accepted that ramps would have been used to raise heavy stone to construct the pyramid, and many plausible models have been suggested. Apparatuses like rollers in which the heavy stone could be placed and then rolled were employed in transport.|$|E
25|$|As {{the second}} Dutch attack on Fontenoy went in, the main allied {{formation}} moved towards the French {{position on the}} plateau. Cumberland took up his place alongside Ligonier {{at the head of}} 20 battalions, 15 British and 5 Hanoverian to their left, led by the British Guards Brigade, each with their two battalion guns, about 13,000 to 15,000 men, drawn <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> disciplined lines, each six ranks deep. However, the narrowness of the defile through which the attack had to pass forced the Hanoverians back to form a third line behind the British. As the British and Hanoverians advanced the French pushed forward the four small three-pounder battalion guns of the Gardes Françaises Brigade and the four of Aubeterre Brigade, the fire from these was added to the bombardment from the Redoubt d'Eu. Cumberland responded by deploying seven of the Guards Brigade's three-pounder battalion guns to push them back. The Duc de Gramont, of Dettingen infamy, was killed by a shot from these. As the column advanced up a slight rise, the British brought up a battery of twelve six-pounder cannons {{to the front of the}} column at such close range that the Gardes Françaises left their supported defensive position against orders, as they had at Dettingen, and advanced, unsupported, in an attempt to take the guns. Both sides exchanged fire at close range. From the Redoubt of d'Eu and Fontenoy the French cannon poured tremendous flanking fire. Whole allied ranks were swept away, but still they pressed forward in perfect order as if on parade, the better to foster cohesion and the better to overawe their opponents. Saxe had never believed that the allies would conceive or execute such a manoeuvre, and here was the one weak spot of his defence – a third redoubt between Fontenoy and the Redoubt of Eu would have rendered the allied advance impossible.|$|E
