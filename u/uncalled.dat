5|$|The IIHF {{assigned}} Norway's Hans Rønning as {{the referee}} for this game. The assignment was made {{based on his}} neutrality despite his inexperience officiating at the international level. Upon hearing of Rønning's assignment, Canadian representative Dennis McDonald sought out IIHF supervisor of officials, René Fasel, hoping to convince him to select a different referee. Aside from the question of his competence to call a game of this magnitude, the Canadians were concerned about Rønning following an earlier game in the tournament he officiated between Canada and the United States. A wild brawl had broken out during the pre-game warm-ups against the Americans three days earlier. The officials {{were not on the}} ice when the melee occurred; however, Rønning ejected one player from each team at random for starting the brawl. Canadian captain Steve Chiasson was thus barred from the game against the Americans, as well as the following game after being assessed a match penalty. Unable to convince IIHF officials to change the assignment, McDonald was concerned about how the game would be played. Rønning's inexperience at that level was later identified as a significant cause of the brawl, as several stick infractions by both sides had gone <b>uncalled,</b> causing anger to rise between both teams.|$|E
5|$|The 2007–08 season saw Central Coast win {{its first}} premiership on goal {{difference}} ahead of Newcastle, following a final round {{that began with}} Central Coast and three other clubs level on 31 points. The final series began with a 2–0 loss to Newcastle in {{the first leg of}} its major semi-final, but the Mariners forced the tie to extra time by holding a 2–0 lead in the second leg after 90 minutes. A 94th-minute goal by Sasho Petrovski, who had scored earlier to level the tie, gave Central Coast a 3–2 win on aggregate, putting the Mariners through to the 2008 A-League Grand Final. In a rematch with Newcastle, the Jets defeated Central Coast 1–0 in the Grand Final, which ended in controversy due to an <b>uncalled</b> handball against Newcastle in Central Coast Mariners penalty box during the closing seconds of the match. If called, the foul would have given Central Coast a penalty kick and a chance to equalise. As Mariners players disputed referee Mark Shield's decision, goalkeeper Danny Vuković struck Shield on the arm, resulting in an immediate sending off and later suspension. Vuković was suspended from both domestic and international competition for nine months, with an additional six-months' suspended ban; the latter period was reduced to three months on appeal. Despite further appeals, the ban was eventually confirmed by FIFA in June, to include banning the young keeper from competing at the 2008 Olympic Games. The ban lasted into October; in response, Central Coast signed former Manchester United and Australian international keeper Mark Bosnich on a seven-week contract.|$|E

25|$|The Provisional Congress in the Fifth Session reached two of {{the most}} {{far-reaching}} decisions for the Confederacy, both politically and militarily. The border states of Missouri and Kentucky were admitted into the Confederate States of America, requiring western theater military decisions otherwise <b>uncalled</b> for, and providing a solid two-state delegation support for the Jefferson Davis government throughout the existence of the Confederacy. Treaties with the five civilized tribes also allowed for their seating non-voting representatives in the Confederate Congress, as did the Territory of New Mexico. With the short-lived claim to the far western Arizona Territory, by the end of 1861 the Confederacy had gained the greatest extent of its territorial expansion. After that point, its de facto governance contracted as Union military actions prevailed.|$|E
25|$|During spring 2012, Jobbik {{representative}} in Hungarian parliament Zsolt Baráth caused an outrage by commemorating 1882 blood libel against the Jews in Parliament. The Tiszaeszlár blood libel, found later to be unrelated to Jews, {{was known as}} first major anti-Jewish event in modern Hungary, predating the Holocaust. The speech of Baráth caused controversy among Jobbik MPs: some - however finding it inappropriate and <b>uncalled</b> for - stated that in a matured democracy {{there should not be}} taboo topics, while leaders of the Jobbik Parliamentary Group told the media that they had evaluated the speech and learnt the lesson that they should care more about what their MPs are talking. After the incident Baráth was not re-elected and is not an MP of Jobbik anymore.|$|E

25|$|D.C.'s homestand {{continued}} with a match against the Eastern Conference leading Philadelphia Union. United {{took the lead}} when Kemp intercepted a pass in the defensive end, raced through the Union defense and beat the goalie to the far post. However, the Union tied the game on a free kick just before halftime. The visitors took the lead when Acosta was dispossessed {{as he tried to}} dribble out of the defensive end and former United star Chris Pontius continued a remarkable renaissance in his first season away from D.C. and put the Union ahead. United's coach, Ben Olsen was ejected late in the second half for protesting one of many <b>uncalled</b> fouls on Acosta. Despite missing their leader, United pushed hard for a tying goal. Despite having a couple of apparent goals waved off by the officials, the team finally found the tying goal in the fourth minute of stoppage time, when Birnbaum got his head {{on the end of a}} service into the box by Nyarko. Despite being only a draw, it was a very emotional goal for the players and fans, but the home draw meant the team remained outside of playoff contention.|$|E
25|$|In 2003 TCB, a band {{based in}} the Washington area, created a spinoff sound from go-go called bounce beat. Bounce beat is a heavier version of its {{ancestor}} that relies on timbales, drums, keyboards and bass to form its signature sound. At a time when bands like Backyard, <b>UnCalled</b> 4, and Raw Image were moving the genre toward a more driving sound by using a more forceful “breakdown” beat, bounce beat seems, in retrospect, like a natural progression. Still, the music was initially dismissed by all but a core of believers. It took fans time to realize TCB’s innovation wasn’t a rejection of “traditional” go-go, but a shift. Instead of paying homage to the genre’s early greats by copying their style, bounce beat built on a strong foundation and showed that the music still had more ideas to explore, limited only by percussive innovation and imagination. Fans of bounce beat, like the sound itself, tend to be much younger than the traditional go-go crowd. The rototom-dependent subgenre was initially maligned—some called it “noise,” others argued that it wasn’t go-go at all. Criticism of bounce beat was similar to what was said about the trap rap bubbling in other cities around the same time: It was blasted for its sometimes suggestive lyrics, its thwacking beat, its tempos that vacillated between syrupy and frenetic. But over time, bounce beat made inroads.|$|E

While Duchovny was working on plot points with Carter, the two agreed that the episode would serve as Duchovny's directorial debut. As the episode did not heavily feature his character, since it is framed as a flashback, Duchovny was {{able to focus on}} pre-production. This narratological method also gave Anderson a minor respite from her work. While Duchovny later expressed gratitude that [...] "The Unnatural" [...] enabled him {{to get a feel for}} directing, he also experienced severe anxiety during the production process because of the stress of both writing and directing. However, when the episode was finished, Duchovny was pleased, calling the results [...] "great."

500|$|Following their intra-team collision, Sauber's team {{principal}} Monisha Kaltenborn put {{blame on}} both drivers. The stewards penalised Ericsson for the incident, handing him a three-place grid penalty {{for the following}} race in Canada as well as three penalty points to his licence. Felipe Nasr was adamant that the team orders he had received prior to the accident had been <b>uncalled</b> for, since his slower pace was due to low tyre temperatures. He also claimed that Ericsson had ignored team orders himself on two occasions in the previous season. Ericsson in turn had a different view {{and said that the}} team had told him for [...] "seven or eight laps" [...] that they would swap the positions of the drivers before he decided to go for the pass himself. Valtteri Bottas and Pascal Wehrlein also received penalties during and after the race. Bottas was handed a ten-second time penalty and two penalty points on his licence for causing a collision with Gutiérrez, while Wehrlein received two separate ten-second penalties: the first for exceeding the allowed lap time under VSC conditions and the second for ignoring blue flags. He was also given two penalty points each for both incidents.|$|E

Campbell did, however, write highly of Ellie Kemper, saying that [...] "she's played [...] funnily and warmly as anyone else". Several reviewers argued that the episode functioned as a filler episode. Brett Davinger of The California Literary Review called it the [...] "epitome of filler". ScreenCrush reviewer Damon Houx wrote that [...] "if everyone {{were in the same}} location this would be a bottle episode". Furthermore, Darryl's subplot was mostly criticized. Tedder wrote that while [...] "it's fine to have a story line where someone pursues something and then realizes it wasn't what it was cracked up to be" [...] he wished that the show had actually developed Val as a character. White wrote that she did not enjoy seeing [...] "this manipulative version of Darryl" [...] because it contrasted with his earlier characterization in episodes like [...] "The Deposition".

500|$|Mueller {{began his}} career wearing the number 55, but {{switched}} to 00 by his sophomore year. During his sophomore season, the 1988–89 team earned a #1 vs. #16 matchup {{in the first round}} of the 1989 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament with their Pete Carril-coached princeton offense. [...] The New York Times reported that the matchup seemed comical to some even though Carill had a system that frustrated many offensive systems and had already produced upsets. In the St. Patrick's Day Georgetown game, the 16th-seeded Tigers were 23 point underdogs according to the Las Vegas bookmakers and Dick Vitale had promised to serve as a Tiger ballboy if they won. Entering the game, the last four Ivy League representatives in the tournament had lost in the first round by an average of 35 points. During the game, Mueller's defensive assignment was Mourning, and he contributed 9 points and 8 assists to Princeton's 49-point effort. [...] During the game, Mueller played beyond the foul line on the offensive end, forcing Mourning to leave passing lanes open for back-door attacks. Although the strategy enabled Princeton to stay in the game, Mourning had seven blocked shots, including two in the final fifteen seconds. Mueller's final shot was deflected by Mourning, which is remembered by Princeton fans as an <b>uncalled</b> foul. [...] The team finished with a 198 (113) record. Later in the same tournament, Duke would use Christian Laettner at the top of the key, like Princeton had used Mueller, and eliminate Georgetown by shutting down Mourning. The Princeton-Georgetown game is regarded as one of only a handful of close #1 vs. #16 matchups in NCAA tournament history. [...] For the season, he repeated as Ivy League field goal percentage champion. [...] He was a first-team All-Ivy honoree. [...] He led the team in points, rebounds, assists and blocked shots.|$|E

With more investigations by broadcasting channels, the claims were deemed fake. DPP officials felt that the wording used by Chuang was insulting and inappropriate, and therefore, publicly apologized for Chuang's <b>uncalled</b> for and profane remarks. His speech was ridden with distaste and foul language deemed inappropriate for broadcast television, and had to be censored by NCC.

The next day, Chuang issued a formal apology through media.|$|E
2500|$|German tank {{commander}} and historian [...] {{is not as}} impressed. In analyzing Wittmann's actions at Villers-Bocage, he called into question his tactical ability. Schneider states: [...] "a competent tank company commander does not accumulate so many serious mistakes". He highlights how Wittmann dispersed his forces in a sunken lane with a broken down tank {{at the head of}} the column thereby hampering the mobility of his unit. The solitary advance into Villers-Bocage was heavily criticized as it breached [...] "all the rules". No intelligence was gathered, and there was no [...] "centre of gravity" [...] or [...] "concentration of forces" [...] in the attack. Schneider argues that due to Wittmann's rash actions: [...] "the bulk of the 2nd Company and Mobius 1st Company came up against an enemy who had gone onto the defensive". He calls Wittmann's [...] "carefree" [...] advance into British-occupied positions [...] "pure folly", and states that [...] "such over hastiness was <b>uncalled</b> for." [...] He concludes that, had a properly prepared assault been launched, involving the rest of his company and the 1st Company, far greater results could have been achieved. Finally, Schneider opines that: [...] "thoughtlessness of this kind was to cost [...] his life ... during an attack casually launched in open country with an exposed flank." ...|$|E

Bentsen retorted, [...] "Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy." [...] Quayle replied, [...] "That was really <b>uncalled</b> for, Senator." [...] Bentsen responded, [...] "You're the one that was making the comparison, Senator."

Thereafter, [...] his [...] "gray solidarity" [...] was [...] "made luminescent by the pallor of the other three men. However, there have been questions raised as to how well Bentsen really knew Kennedy. Some have claimed they only had a nodding acquaintance." [...] Bentsen had in fact considered in advance how to respond, because Congressman Dennis E. Eckart, who played Quayle in Bentsen's rehearsals, knew that Quayle had previously compared himself to Kennedy, so he worked it into Bentsen's debate preparation. Quayle had been prepped by Senator Bob Packwood, as Packwood served with Bentsen on the Senate Finance Committee.|$|E

2500|$|In July 1997, Weld was {{nominated}} to become United States Ambassador to Mexico by President Bill Clinton. His nomination stalled after Senate Foreign Relations committee Chairman Jesse Helms refused {{to hold a}} hearing on the nomination, effectively blocking it. Helms was also a Republican and their party held the majority in the chamber, but Helms objected to Weld's moderate stance on social issues such as his support for gay rights, abortion rights, and the legalization of medical marijuana. This refusal to hold hearings was also rumored to be at the request of former United States Attorney General and friend of Helms, Edwin Meese. Meese reportedly had a long-standing grudge against Weld stemming from Weld's investigation of Meese during the Iran-Contra affair. Meese denied the speculation, asserting that he wished to keep his distance from Weld. Weld publicly criticized Helms, which the White House discouraged him from doing, but Weld relished the opportunity, saying: [...] "It feels like being in a campaign. I feel newly energized. I love to stir up the pot. I seem to click on more cylinders when the pot is stirred up." [...] Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that Weld's chances of being confirmed weren't [...] "very good, and that he hurt himself by attacking the chairman unfairly and with political rhetoric that was just <b>uncalled</b> for." [...] There was speculation that the White House would let his nomination [...] "die", but he refused, saying that he hoped President Clinton [...] "does not plan to give in to ideological extortion" [...] and that [...] "I wanted to send a message that I wanted to be captain of my ship [...] even if it's going to bottom."

2500|$|While {{all records}} of all a company's {{debentures}} {{need to be}} kept by the company, debentures secured by a [...] "charge" [...] must additionally be registered under the Companies Act 2006 section 860 with Companies House, along with any charge on land, negotiable instruments, <b>uncalled</b> shares, book debts and floating charges, among other things. The purpose of registration is chiefly to publicise which creditors take priority, so that creditors can assess a company's risk profile when making lending decisions. The sanction for failure to register is that the charge becomes void, and unenforceable. This does not extinguish the debt itself, but any advantage from priority is lost and the lender will be an unsecured creditor. In National Provincial Bank v Charnley {{there had been a}} dispute about which creditor should have priority after Mr Charnley's assets had been seized, with the Bank claiming its charge was first and properly registered. Giving judgment for the bank Atkin LJ held that a charge, which will confer priority, simply arises through a contract, [...] "where in a transaction for value both parties evince an intention that property, existing or future, shall be made available as security for the payment of a debt, and that the creditor shall have a present right to have it made available, there is a charge". This means a charge simply arises by virtue of contractual freedom. Legal and equitable charges are two of four kinds of security created through consent recognised in English law. A legal charge, more usually called a mortgage, is a transfer of legal title to property on condition that when a debt is repaid title will be reconveyed. An equitable charge used to be distinct in {{that it would not be}} protected against bona fide purchasers without notice of the interest, but now registration has removed this distinction. In addition the law recognises a pledge, where a person hands over some property in return for a loan, and a possessory lien, where a lender retains property already in their possession for some other reason until a debt is discharged, but these do not require registration.|$|E
