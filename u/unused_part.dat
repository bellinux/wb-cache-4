5|$|From 1903 to 1905 the {{original}} school building {{was known as}} Pocantico Lodge, a small year-round hotel. In 1905 Alice Knox, an employee at Mrs. Dow's School, opened Miss Knox's School in the building. Destroyed by fire in 1912, the school moved to nearby Tarrytown and then to Cooperstown. The Knox School moved to St. James, on Long Island, in 1954. The only remaining feature of the Pocantico Lodge building is a stone retaining wall {{in front of the}} current building on the site, built in 1925 by Oscar Vatet for Rufus P. Johnston (pastor of John D. Rockefeller's Fifth Avenue Baptist Church). The building, later occupied by Arthur O'Connor, Cognitronics, and Frank B. Hall, is currently an <b>unused</b> <b>part</b> of Briarcliff Corporate Campus.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 Sheffield City Council {{negotiated}} with Yorkshire Water and leased an <b>unused</b> <b>part</b> {{of the former}} sewage works for 99 years, at an annual rent of one peppercorn, to enable it to be reclaimed {{and turned into a}} nature reserve. In order to manage the project, a consortium was formed, with representation from Sheffield City Council, Sheffield Wildlife Trust, South Yorkshire Forest and Yorkshire Water. It now provides habitat for migrating birds, for which it is an area of European significance. The Wildlife Trust run an active programme of school education visits. In 2005 the City Council exercised an option to increase the size of the reserve by taking over additional land from Yorkshire Water.|$|E
25|$|The abadan {{island is}} an {{important}} area {{for the production of}} datepalms, but it has suffered from the invasion of the Iraqi army during the Iraq-Iran war. The palm groves are irrigated by tidal irrigation. At high tide, the waterlevel in the rivers is set up and the river flow enters the irrigation canals that have been dug from the river towards the inland plantations. At low tide, the canals drain the <b>unused</b> <b>part</b> of the water back to the river.|$|E

25|$|At 7:30 pm on Monday evening, October 28, 1907, {{a band of}} Seattle Socialists braved the {{pouring rain}} {{and headed for the}} city's new Pike Street Market, bustling with 1500 shoppers. SPW State Chairman John Downie went first, {{ascending}} a wooden box in an <b>unused</b> <b>part</b> of the marketplace. A cheer erupted from the crowd which encircled the speaker, and more came running, expecting fireworks. Downie told the crowd of a planned march to the City Council Chamber later that evening — and was promptly arrested. Next came James Lund of Redondo, Washington, who got no further before he, too, was arrested and taken away. Elmer Allison of Local Bangor, A.G. Ball of Portland, Oregon, and Harry Ault and Hulet Wells of Seattle each ascended the box in turn, said a few choice words, and were escorted away by police.|$|E
500|$|In June 2014 it was {{reported}} that the Vale of Glamorgan Council had ruled that {{there was no need for}} an extensive environmental assessment of a solar farm planned by ABP for an <b>unused</b> <b>part</b> of the dock. The solar farm would be built on two brownfield sites and would cover a [...] Power would be delivered direct to businesses in and around the port, with the surplus fed into the grid.

500|$|In 2006 a {{proposal}} {{was made by}} Hawthorn Power, an offshoot of UK Coal, to construct three [...] tall wind turbines on an <b>unused</b> <b>part</b> of the station's coal sorting area, north of the power station. Permission was granted for the turbines in February 2008. In July 2010, {{it was revealed that}} the project's new developer, Clipper Windpower, would be using the site to erect the country's first super-efficient wind turbines, called Liberty Wind Turbine. However, this meant the height of the turbines would increase from [...] to [...] Each turbine would have a rating of 2.5MW, but only three turbines would be built. The wind farm would produce enough electricity to provide power for 1,690 houses. One turbine is expected to be erected initially, while environmental issues are assessed.|$|E
50|$|Production {{of up to}} 10,000 cars a {{year was}} talked about but as few as ten {{complete}} cars were produced during the six months before production ceased. After the factory closed, the <b>unused</b> <b>parts</b> were dumped into the local lake, Lough Muckno.|$|R
25|$|The factory {{was secured}} after {{production}} ceased, and recently Rimmer Brothers acquired the entire stock of <b>unused</b> <b>parts</b> for resale in the UK. This {{has meant that}} a number of parts which had not been available for some time can now be bought new.|$|R
25|$|The {{two main}} {{platforms}} {{that are currently}} served by stopping services have been shortened by fencing off the <b>unused</b> <b>parts</b> of the platform. Only short Class 166 DMUs and Class 165 DMUs use these platforms so maintaining their full length is unnecessary. Longer trains can use the third platform.|$|R

50|$|Spectrum pooling is a {{spectrum}} management strategy in which multiple radio spectrum users can coexist {{within a single}} allocation of radio spectrum space. One use of this technique is for primary users of {{a spectrum}} allocation {{to be able to}} rent out use of <b>unused</b> <b>parts</b> of their allocation to secondary users. Spectrum pooling schemes generally require cognitive radio techniques to implement them.|$|R
30|$|This {{inefficiency}} is {{stemmed from}} the bandwidth allocation information included within each frame, coupled by <b>unused</b> <b>parts</b> of allocated bandwidth due to nodes {{not being able to}} fill their allocated bandwidth, and is multiplied by the number of link allocations within the system. By reducing the number of individual connections within the system, more of the bandwidth can be used for actual data transmission.|$|R
