5|$|After {{recovering}} from his injuries, Mulder {{attempts to find}} information on the railcar, but he is <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> Scully returns the journal that he found on the car, but Mulder realizes {{that it is a}} rewritten substitute. Meanwhile, the real journal is translated in a shadowy room as the Smoking Man watches.|$|E
5|$|The North Complex is a {{collection}} of several landforms, including craters, that were thought to have been formed by volcanic activity. Although the Apollo 15 astronauts were to visit this feature, they were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> due to time constraints and time-consuming issues in obtaining core samples.|$|E
5|$|Captain Kirk, {{played by}} John Belushi, orders {{the ship to}} outrun the strange craft. <b>Unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> he orders phasers and photon torpedoes to destroy the craft. Unfortunately, all of the ship's {{equipment}} fails for no reason and the Enterprises systems break down. Suddenly, Dr. Leonard McCoy, played by Dan Aykroyd, runs onto the bridge saying that the aliens are on the ship. He says they did not beam aboard, but merely walked {{out from behind the}} curtains.|$|E
50|$|He {{was denied}} bail under the Queensland Bail Act s. 16(3) (b) which states {{as he was}} not a {{resident}} of Queensland he needed to show cause for receiving bail. He was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this <b>so</b> his bail was denied.|$|R
50|$|Terry Hayes was {{originally}} meant {{to write the}} script but he was exhausted from Dead Calm and Tony Morphett was given the job. However Morphett was too caught up in work on Sweet Talker (1989) and was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, <b>so</b> Hayes stepped back in.|$|R
2500|$|Paternalism – {{the belief}} that a state (or other organization) ought to make {{decisions}} on behalf of individuals who are presumed <b>to</b> be <b>unable</b> or unwilling <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> ...|$|R
5|$|Even {{before the}} Quebec Agreement was signed, Akers had already cabled London with {{instructions}} that Chadwick, Peierls, Oliphant and Francis Simon should leave immediately for North America. They arrived on 19 August, {{the day it}} was signed, expecting {{to be able to talk}} to American scientists, but were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> Two weeks would pass before American officials learnt of the contents of the Quebec Agreement. Over the next two years, the Combined Policy Committee met only eight times.|$|E
5|$|For Cagney's next film, he {{traveled}} to Ireland for Shake Hands with the Devil, directed by Michael Anderson. Cagney had hoped {{to spend some time}} tracing his Irish ancestry, but time constraints and poor weather meant that he was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> The overriding message of violence inevitably leading to more violence attracted Cagney to the role of an Irish Republican Army commander, and resulted in what some critics would regard as the finest performance of his final years.|$|E
5|$|Allemand {{requested}} that Cotes come aboard Carmagnole, but Cotes responded {{that he was}} <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> as his ship's boats had all been destroyed. Allemand sent a boat from his own ship to Thames and brought Cotes to Carmagnole as a prisoner of war; Cotes used the delay to destroy his ship's documents. Allemand questioned Cotes intently {{about the nature of}} his recent combat and, on identifying Uranie as one of his own squadron, commented that Tartu should have defeated Thames in half the time the action had taken.|$|E
50|$|Stalking {{has also}} been {{described}} as a form of close relationship between the parties, albeit a disjunctive one where the two participants have opposing goals rather than cooperative goals. One participant, often the woman, likely wishes to end the relationship entirely, but may find herself <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> easily <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> The other participant, often but not always a man, wishes to escalate the relationship. It has {{been described as a}} close relationship because the duration, frequency, and intensity of contact may rival that of a more traditional conjunctive dating relationship.|$|R
5000|$|Laurence Olivier was {{originally}} offered {{the role of}} the agent but was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it <b>so</b> Burgess Meredith was cast instead. Meredith got the role after walking into 21 one night when Joe E. Levine was there - Levine cast him on the spot. Meredith modelled his performance on the agent Swifty Lazar, even shaving his head to look like Lazar. [...] "I tried to get his cool, understated manner, his sharp clothes and, most of all, his way of speaking softly so that you've got to lean over to hear what he's saying," [...] said Meredith.|$|R
50|$|The International Criminal Court (ICC) was {{established}} by the Rome Statute in 1998. It is the first international criminal court that helps end impunity for perpetrators of severe crimes. It {{was established}} to investigate and try leaders of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity in cases where countries are <b>unable</b> or unwilling <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b>|$|R
5|$|Daft Punk were {{scheduled}} {{to appear on the}} episode of The Colbert Report on 6 August 2013 to promote Random Access Memories, but were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> because of contractual obligations regarding the duo's later appearance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. According to Stephen Colbert, Daft Punk were unaware of any exclusivity agreement and were halted by MTV executives the morning prior to the taping. In 2015, Daft Punk appeared alongside several other musicians to announce their co-ownership of the music service Tidal at its relaunch.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} the storm, public schools and many private schools closed, Although no {{mandatory}} evacuations were ordered, multiple shelters were opened in schools and churches and government offices shut down in anticipation of Harvey's onslaught. Several counties issued a state of emergency. Residents prepared individually by, for example, securing boats and lawn furniture. Free sand and sandbags were {{made available to the}} general public and inmates filled bags for those physically <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> themselves. Officials at Lake Manatee began lowering the water level to help avoid flooding. In Hillsborough County the threat of the storm forced the cancellation of local football programs.|$|E
5|$|Mi Tierra was {{produced}} by Estefan's husband, Emilio Estefan, and fellow Miami Sound Machine members Clay Ostwald and Jorge Casas. It features notable Latin musicians, including Nestor Torres, Cachao López, Paquito Hechavarría, Chamin Correa, Paquito D'Rivera, Arturo Sandoval, Luis Enrique and Tito Puente. Additional performers include Sheila E. and the London Symphony Orchestra. The album was recorded at Crescent Moon Studios in Miami, Florida. Celia Cruz was invited to perform, but was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> because of her touring schedule. The album's cover features Estefan in a black-and-white photo at a Havana nightclub before the Cuban Revolution.|$|E
50|$|In Madrid in 1939 {{during the}} final days of the Spanish Civil War, Virtudes and Carmen, two young idealistic Republican militants, are {{encouraging}} their neighbours to keep faith in the cause of the Republic. However, the entry of Franco's victorious troops into the city is eminent. Fearing the bloody repression that was coming, many Republicans are fleeing the country while others are <b>unable</b> or unwilling <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The United States {{is not a}} {{participant}} in the International Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC is a permanent international criminal court, founded in 2002 by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (Rome Statute) to [...] "bring to justice the perpetrators of the worst crimes known to humankind - war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide", especially when national courts are <b>unable</b> or unwilling <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b>|$|R
50|$|Greece's large {{budget deficit}} {{was funded by}} running a large foreign {{financial}} surplus. As the inflow of money stopped during the crisis, reducing the foreign financial surplus, Greece was forced to reduce its budget deficit substantially. Countries facing such a sudden reversal in capital flows typically devalue their currencies to resume the inflow of capital; however, Greece was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this, and <b>so</b> has instead suffered significant income (GDP) reduction, another form of devaluation.|$|R
5|$|On 21 January, Bader {{dramatically}} altered {{his previous}} orders regarding {{the treatment of}} those encountered {{in the area of}} operations, directing that those who did not resist and surrendered or merely had weapons in their houses, were to be treated as prisoners of war. It is likely that this change was intended to assist Chetniks in the area of operations to avoid destruction. By the end of January, Bader's chief of staff was attempting to negotiate a cooperation agreement with Dangić, and in turn Dangić ordered the 4,500–10,000 Chetniks under his command to avoid the Germans or surrender their weapons immediately if they were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
5|$|Plans to link it westwards to the Oakham Canal, northwards to the South Forty-Foot Drain and southwards to the River Nene in 1809 came to nothing, and {{it closed}} in 1863, {{soon after the}} arrival of the Midland Railway in the area. Although Stamford Corporation {{attempted}} to sell it after closure, its ownership was disputed, and they were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> Its course and some of its structures can still be traced in the landscape. These include warehouses at the terminus in Stamford, and a weir which regulated water levels on the River Gwash, which it crossed on the level.|$|E
5|$|Racing veteran Jarno Trulli (Trulli GP) {{started in}} the first group, as {{qualifying}} began at 12:00, and posted a strong time of 1:21.547 early in the session, being the first to lap the course in under 1:22. Also in the group was Nelson Piquet, Jr.– second in the championship– who ultimately managed only 13th place on the grid. As qualifying progressed, championship leader Lucas di Grassi and Monaco winner Sébastien Buemi came close to beating Trulli's time, but proved <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> handing Trulli a surprising pole position, his first in Formula E.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the death}} of Trifunović-Birčanin in February 1943, Đujić, along with Dobroslav Jevđević, Baćović, and Ivanišević vowed to the Italians to carry on Trifunović-Birčanin's {{policies}} of closely collaborating with them against the Yugoslav Partisans. Đujić's detachments in Dalmatia and western Bosnia were used by the Italians almost {{up to the point}} of their surrender. Following Italian capitulation in September 1943, the Germans were less supportive of Đujić than the Italians had been, and restricted his activities to guarding railway tracks from Partisan sabotage. On 19 or 20 November 1943, Mihailović ordered Đujić to collaborate with the Germans, adding that he himself was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> openly <b>do</b> <b>so</b> [...] "because of public opinion." ...|$|R
40|$|Only {{a limited}} number of {{countries}} will participate in the single currency area at its formation on January 1 st, 1999. A new link between the currencies participating in the Euro zone and those <b>unable</b> or unwilling <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> must therefore be created. A new EMS, with the Euro as its anchor currency, must be installed to ease the path into EMU for those countries that wish to join at a later date...|$|R
5000|$|The song is {{told from}} the {{perspective}} of a once-successful performer, who laments about his current lack of success and appeal to audiences because he sings [...] "sad" [...] songs. He refers to his past successes, including his ability to entertain large crowds and repertoire of mainly uptempo, [...] "happy" [...] songs. However, his personal life is anything but happy, and it affects his performing style; he soon begins performing only heartbreak songs, songs he quickly finds his fans don't want to hear. His fans soon begin alienating him, and soon nobody is coming to his shows. Worse, when he tries to rekindle his success by performing his previous [...] "happy" [...] songs, he finds he is <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> credibly <b>do</b> <b>so</b> because of his personal heartbreak.|$|R
5|$|Ross {{established}} the general geography of this region, and named {{many of its}} features; the Ross Sea, the Great Ice Barrier (later renamed the Ross Ice Shelf), Ross Island, Cape Adare, Victoria Land, McMurdo Sound, Cape Crozier and the twin volcanoes Mount Erebus and Mount Terror. He returned to the Barrier several times, hoping to penetrate it, but was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> achieving his Farthest South in a small Barrier inlet at 78°10′, in February 1842. Ross suspected that land lay {{to the east of}} the Barrier, but was unable to confirm this.|$|E
5|$|The Emperor {{is known}} to hold the nominal {{ceremonial}} authority. For example, the Emperor {{is the only person}} that has the authority to appoint the Prime Minister, even though the Diet has the power to designate the person fitted for the position. One such example can be prominently seen in the 2009 Dissolution of the House of Representatives. The House was expected to be dissolved on the advice of the Prime Minister, but was temporarily <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> for the next general election, as both the Emperor and Empress were visiting Canada.|$|E
5|$|The Question {{explains}} that he has evidence that indicates Doctor Psycho was in Kahndaq when Doctor Light was killed. Superman is physically ill and struggles to control his powers as he and the Question {{break out of the}} base to track down Doctor Psycho, with several other heroes in tow. When they confront Doctor Psycho, they determine that although he was present, he was not responsible for what happened in Kahndaq. Meanwhile, Pandora attempts to convince Vandal Savage to open the box, but he is also <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
40|$|Whenever {{possible}} mothers {{should be}} encouraged to breastfeed their babies. If, however, the mother is <b>unable</b> or unwilling <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> the baby is bottle-fed. The goal of infant nutrition is a well nourished but not over nourished infant. In accomplishing this end, the infant may be either breastfed or artificially fed with cow’s milk, evaporated milk, or one of the many prepared formulas that are currently available. This article is also concerned with weaning and the introduction of solid foods...|$|R
2500|$|Hoveyda's {{became a}} {{household}} name in Iran through the constant character assassination he received by the late Towfigh magazine, Iran's most popular political satire magazine. [...] Hoveyda was largely unknown among the population of Iran before Towfigh publisized him. [...] He was caricatured in Towfigh's weekly magazine carrying a cane (caused by a traffic accident {{in which he was}} involved), wearing one carnation in his suit jacket pocket, and smoking a pipe. [...] Towfigh magazine referred to him as [...] "The Caned One" [...] and even devoted an entire book dedicated to exposing his flaws as a premier entitled [...] "Assa-Nameh". The magazine (and Iranian media in general) frequently criticized and lampooned Hoveyda, primarily because they intended to criticize the Shah himself, but were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> directly <b>do</b> <b>so</b> due <b>to</b> censorship.|$|R
50|$|Irving takes Billy to {{meet with}} a {{counselor}} while they contact Billy's dad. Chuck {{turns out to be a}} deadbeat who refuses to take Billy in as he is <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> afford <b>doing</b> <b>so.</b> When his girlfriend comes in to remind him that he can get child support for Billy, he instructs Irving to take Billy down to Raleigh, North Carolina to drop him off with him by Sunday. Irving starts selling Ellie's belongings, and tries to sell her bed to a potential customer. Later, Irving calls a couple of unwitting guys to come help remove the bed, though he really asks them to help him and Billy carry Ellie's body to the trunk of his car, since he felt that she needs to be taken south to be buried properly.|$|R
5|$|The first {{challenge}} to Edwin came {{soon after his}} marriage-alliance with Kent, concluded at Canterbury {{in the summer of}} 625. By offering his protection to lesser kings, such as the king of Wight, Edwin thwarted the ambitions of Cwichelm of Wessex. Cwichelm's response was to send an assassin, as noted already. Edwin did not immediately respond to this insult, suggesting either that he felt <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> or that Bede's portrayal of him as a rather indecisive ruler is accurate. Following the failed assassination, as noted, Edwin committed himself to Christianity provided only that he was victorious against Cwichelm.|$|E
5|$|William De Morgan {{was unwilling}} to {{compromise}} on quality or embrace the trend towards mass production, and by this time his work was significantly more expensive than similar works by other designers. Consequently, his ceramics business was becoming increasingly unviable financially. In 1906 his first novel, Joseph Vance, was published and became a great success, prompting DeMorgan to close the ceramics business in 1907 to concentrate on writing. Mary Watts attempted to replicate DeMorgan's tile designs at Watts's pottery in Compton but was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> and investigated other tile manufacturers.|$|E
5|$|A 1935 {{article in}} the Montreal Gazette, meanwhile, stated that the {{original}} September Morn had yet {{to go to the}} United States, and that Chabas had sold it directly to Mantashev. According to Chabas, this was after an American approached him to purchase the painting, but was unwilling to pay the asking price. In her memoirs, Vogue editor Edna Woolman Chase recounted how Ortiz had arranged for numerous reproductions to be made and sent to New York, and that– although he had been interested in acquiring the original– he had been <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> Although {{it is possible that the}} original did not cross the Atlantic by 1913, it is clear that reproductions did.|$|E
50|$|Due to Joe's injuries, the {{travelers}} decide {{to stay in}} the nearly deserted village. Mike seduces the naive Pat. In a cocaine-fueled rage, he encourages Pat to kill a native girl. She is <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, <b>so</b> Mike kills the girl himself. In his dying moments, Joe reveals that he and Mike were responsible for the cannibals' aggression. They came to the region to exploit the natives for emeralds and cocaine, taking advantage of their trust in white men. One day, while high on cocaine, Mike brutally tortured and killed their native guide {{in full view of the}} tribe. A badly charred body, previously believed to be that of a different guide, is actually this native. Mike kidnapped a native girl to lead them out of the jungle, but the outsiders were followed and attacked.|$|R
50|$|Sylar {{returns to}} the {{carnival}} to face Samuel, but Sylar finds that while he wants to kill, he is <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> make himself <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> His identity in crisis, he makes a deal with Samuel. After absorbing Lydia's power, he tells Samuel {{to give him a}} tattoo, and that he would do whatever it said. When he sees the tattoo, he decides that he does not belong at the carnival. The next scene shows him floating outside of Claire Bennet's dorm room window, and his tattoo is a picture of her.|$|R
500|$|The {{first two}} fire engines <b>to</b> arrive were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> much <b>to</b> stop the fire, as the drivers misjudged their distance, and also making foam {{required}} the main transfer gearboxes {{of the fire}} engines to be operated, which meant that the vehicles were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> move while <b>doing</b> <b>so.</b> Problems with couplings on the fire hoses exacerbated the situation – [...] the fire hydrants had been regularly painted, and a build up of paint on the coupling threads prevented the hoses from being attached to the hydrants. The driver of a back-up foam tender drove in closer to the burning aircraft and discharged his foam effectively, but the fire had already gained hold {{by the time this}} happened.|$|R
