5|$|Lindwall and Miller were {{groundbreaking}} fast bowlers, {{with high}} pace {{and the ability}} to deliver menacing short-pitched bowling at the <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> of the batsmen. Prior to World War II, pace bowlers were generally much slower and rarely bowled at the body. England were yet to develop similar bowlers, and as a result, Australia were able to pepper the <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> of the opposition without fear of retaliation. At one stage, the Australian short-pitched barrage prompted the English selectors to drop leading batsman Hutton, something that provoked great controversy. Lindwall and Johnston dominated the home batsmen and took 27 wickets apiece, at averages of 19.62 and 23.33 respectively, while the injury-prone Miller took 13 at 23.15. For England, the batsman emerging with most credit was Compton, who scored 562 runs at 62.44. Washbrook (356 runs at 50.85) was the only other player to average beyond 45.|$|E
5|$|The <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> had a crew {{compartment}} {{common to all}} versions. This had bench seats, one for the driver and his assistant, and another for the crew. The rear portion of the <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> was adapted for the vehicle's intended role. The artillery model had two extra bench seats for the gun's crew and space for its ammunition. The cargo version had just two storage compartments mounted {{in the front of}} the cargo compartment, one on each side, that opened to the outside. The windshield could fold forward and was also removable. A convertible canvas top was mounted at the upper part of the rear body. It fastened to the windshield when erected.|$|E
5|$|A special but unusual {{consideration}} is cardiogenic shock, where {{the blood pressure}} is decreased not due to dehydration but due to inability of the heart to pump blood through the blood vessels. This situation requires ICU admission, monitoring of the central venous pressure (which requires the insertion of a central venous catheter in a large <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> vein), and the administration of medication that increases the heart pumping action and blood pressure.|$|E
50|$|<b>Upper</b> <b>body's</b> side {{sections}} {{have the}} founder's heraldic decoration and two kings of arms placed at {{height of the}} central shield.|$|R
5000|$|Chi Geuk (...) is the lower-body {{equivalent}} of the <b>upper</b> <b>body's</b> Chi Sau training, aimed on developing awareness in the lower body and obtaining relaxation of the legs.|$|R
5000|$|Fishermen in Japan and the East Indies {{had long}} {{constructed}} [...] "hybrids" [...] by stitching the <b>upper</b> <b>bodies</b> of apes onto {{the bodies of}} fish. They were sometimes used for religious purposes.|$|R
5|$|Artificial {{climbing}} {{walls are}} used to simulate boulder problems in an indoor environment, usually at climbing gyms. These walls are constructed with wooden panels, polymer cement panels, concrete shells, or precast molds of actual rock walls. Holds, usually made of plastic, are then bolted onto the wall to create problems. The walls often feature steep overhanging surfaces, forcing the climber to employ highly technical movements while supporting much of their weight with their <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> strength.|$|E
5|$|Bradman's {{relentless}} use of {{his pace}} attack and fieldsmen also raised eyebrows. At the time, Lindwall and Miller were groundbreaking fast bowlers, with high pace {{and the ability to}} deliver menacing short-pitched bowling at the <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> of the English batsmen. Prior to the Second World War, pace bowlers were generally much slower and did not often bowl at the body. England had yet to develop bowlers such as Lindwall and Miller, and as a result, Australia were able to pepper the <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> of the opposition without fear of retaliation. At times, the public found Lindwall and Miller's short-pitched bowling to be excessive and booed the Australians. On the fielding front, Barnes was deployed as close to the bat as possible at either forward short-leg or point, with one foot on the pitch. This had an intimidatory effect on the batsmen and led many to question whether it was {{in the spirit of the}} game.|$|E
5|$|Distinguished Maya warriors entered battle wearing armour. The <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> {{was covered}} by a short jacket that was filled with rock salt, and the forearms and legs were {{protected}} with tight bindings of cloth or leather. The salt-packed cotton armour was tough enough that even arrows could not penetrate it. Armour could be decorated and was often adorned with feathers. Commoners did not wear armour in battle, usually only wearing a loincloth and warpaint. Warriors carried shields made from two right-angled wooden bars with deerskin stretched across them.|$|E
5000|$|The album's {{original}} cover depicted the band members' <b>upper</b> <b>bodies</b> without clothing. This caused critics to accuse {{the band of}} trying to sell themselves as [...] "poster boys for the master race".|$|R
50|$|Adults have olive gray <b>upper</b> <b>bodies,</b> darker {{coloration}} on {{the wings}} and tail, conspicuous white eye rings, white wing bars, small bills, and short tails. The breast of this species is distinctive, washed with a strong orange-buff color.|$|R
50|$|A {{striking}} {{difference between}} Argentine tango and ballroom tango {{is in the}} shape and feel of the embrace. Ballroom technique dictates that partners arch their <b>upper</b> <b>bodies</b> away from each other, while maintaining contact at the hip, in an offset frame.|$|R
5|$|England's bodyline tactics, which {{involved}} bowling at speeds of around 150km/h at the heads and torsoes of the Australian batsmen—including Woodfull—and employing a close leg-side cordon to catch balls fended {{away from the}} <b>upper</b> <b>body,</b> caused great controversy and ill-feeling among Australian players and crowds. England devised the tactics {{in an attempt to}} curb Donald Bradman, Australia's star batsman, whose average hovered around 100, around twice that of all other world-class batsman. However, they also hoped to restrict the other batsmen, Woodfull among them, through such means.|$|E
5|$|Hershey lost 2–1 in {{overtime}} against Binghamton on October 21. The game {{would have gone}} to a shootout, but under the first usage of the AHL's new video replay system at Giant Center, a Senators goal that had been overturned with 6.5 seconds left {{in overtime}} was restored. The Bears were held to a single goal in a second straight game in a 3–1 loss to Connecticut Whale on October 26, but the next day saw their first home win and first shutout victory of the season. They defeated the Albany Devils 3–0 and Holtby, who had been sidelined since the previous week by an <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> injury, made 35 saves. Forward T.J. Syner was recalled from the ECHL's Reading Royals and made his Hershey debut in that game. The Bears finished the month with a 3–2 victory against the Penguins on October 28, marking their first winning streak of the season. Orlov would miss the next four games due to an <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> injury, not returning until November 11.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Paul retains {{elements}} of a powerful and alert patriarch. The painting is set at a curious angle, so that although Paul is positioned low in the pictorial space, the viewer still looks upwards towards him as if in respect. He is dressed in full pomp, wearing wide fur-lined sleeves (a typical Venetian device to convey status), and his cape is laid across his <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> to suggest physical presence.|$|E
5000|$|Mariliths have {{humanoid}} female <b>upper</b> <b>bodies</b> {{with six}} arms. Depending {{on the particular}} edition and illustrator, their head and torso may look almost human or be covered in reptilian scales. Their lower bodies are those of giant snakes, typically green or brown.|$|R
50|$|Coloration is variable. While dark {{spotting}} {{appears to}} {{be found on the}} bottom of all adult green-eyed tree frogs, colors range from bright green to brassy on their <b>upper</b> <b>bodies.</b> The green-eyed tree frog gets its name from the green coloration of the iris.|$|R
50|$|Hunters would {{therefore}} slowly approach their quarry by walking alongside their horses, keeping their <b>upper</b> <b>bodies</b> {{out of sight}} until the flock was within firing range. Animals trained for this purpose were called stalking horses. Sometimes mobile hides are used for a similar purpose.|$|R
5|$|Ski orienteering {{is a form}} of {{cross-country}} skiing competition that requires navigation in a landscape, making optimal route choices at racing speeds. Standard orienteering maps are used, but with special green overprinting of trails and tracks to indicate their navigability in snow; other symbols indicate whether any roads are snow-covered or clear. Standard skate-skiing equipment is used, along with a map holder attached to the chest. It is one of the four orienteering disciplines recognized by the International Orienteering Federation. <b>Upper</b> <b>body</b> strength is especially important because of frequent double poling along narrow snow trails.|$|E
5|$|Strength-stones {{are used}} in modern times for {{strength}} training, particularly in the martial arts where such practices are known as hojo undō. Special stones are manufactured for this purpose, usually with a wooden handle to aid their manipulation; such stones are also known as chi ishi. It is a common practice in karate, used in solo training to improve stances and <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> strength.|$|E
5|$|The Colonel {{was finally}} {{discovered}} in the Dōtonbori River on March 10, 2009. Divers who recovered the statue at first thought {{it was only a}} large barrel, and shortly after a human corpse, but Hanshin fans on the scene were quick to identify it as the <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> of the long-lost Colonel. The right hand and lower body were found next day, but the statue is still missing its glasses and left hand. It is said that the only way the curse can be lifted is by returning his long-lost glasses and left hand.|$|E
500|$|Depictions of {{entities}} {{with the}} tails of fish, but <b>upper</b> <b>bodies</b> {{of human beings}} appear in Mesopotamian artwork from the Old Babylonian Period onwards. These figures are usually mermen, but mermaids do occasionally appear. The name for the mermaid figure may have been kuliltu, meaning [...] "fish-woman".|$|R
60|$|Huddled {{together}} in the ditch was a pile of dead bodies, and among them peeped {{out a piece of}} a female dress. Anxious to relieve their friend's agonizing suspense, the young men leaped down into the ditch, and began removing the <b>upper</b> <b>bodies</b> from the ghastly pile.|$|R
50|$|In a {{semicircle}} {{on the sides}} of the back of the stage are the figures of 18 young women popularly known as the muses (although there are only nine muses in Greek mythology). The monotone <b>upper</b> <b>bodies</b> of the women protrude from the wall and their lower bodies are depicted by colorful mosaics that form part of the wall. Each of the women is playing a different musical instrument, and each is wearing a different skirt, blouse, and headdress of elaborate design. In the early days of the Palau, many critics found these figures unsettling or even eerie, but today they are widely regarded as perhaps the best sculptural work in the concert hall. The <b>upper</b> <b>bodies</b> were sculpted by Eusebi Arnau, and the mosaic work of their lower bodies was created by Lluís Bru.|$|R
5|$|The <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> had a baggage {{compartment}} separating the driver's compartment from the crew compartment. Bench {{seats on the}} sides of the vehicle, with under-seat storage, could accommodate six men. The windshield could fold forward and was also removable. A convertible canvas top was mounted at the upper part of the rear body. It fastened to the windshield when erected. Four side pieces could be mounted to protect the crew from the weather.|$|E
5|$|The <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> had a crew {{compartment}} with three bench seats, {{one for the}} driver and his assistant, and two others for the crew. The rear cargo area contained storage compartments, {{one on each side}} and two in the rear. The windshield could fold forward and was also removable. A convertible canvas top was mounted above the rear storage compartments. It fastened to the windshield when erected.|$|E
5|$|A mermaid is {{a legendary}} aquatic {{creature}} {{with the head}} and <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> of a female human and {{the tail of a}} fish. Mermaids appear in the folklore of many cultures worldwide, including the Near East, Europe, Africa and Asia. The first stories appeared in ancient Assyria, in which the goddess Atargatis transformed herself into a mermaid out of shame for accidentally killing her human lover. Mermaids are sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, storms, shipwrecks and drownings. In other folk traditions (or sometimes within the same tradition), they can be benevolent or beneficent, bestowing boons or falling in love with humans.|$|E
50|$|These {{are large}} storks, {{typically}} 100 cm tall, with a 180 cm wingspan {{and a long}} thick bill. Members of this genus are more variable in plumage than other storks, but several species have black <b>upper</b> <b>bodies</b> and wings, and white belly and undertail. Juveniles are a duller, browner version of the adult.|$|R
50|$|The {{constant}} {{looting and}} vandalism {{in the main}} basement of Complex (A), mainly the large holes at the bottom, on bodies 2 and 3, made necessary in 1989 to make some partial restoration interventions (architectural volumetric restitution) to prevent {{the collapse of the}} southwest corner of the basement, the <b>upper</b> <b>bodies</b> stability was compromised.|$|R
50|$|In addition, the marionettes {{used for}} Space Patrol were more realistic-looking and less cartoon-like than those being used on Fireball XL5; {{in terms of}} {{relative}} realism, the puppets of Space Patrol fall between that of Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons. There were two types of robots, and {{the ones with the}} thick <b>upper</b> <b>bodies</b> were mainly used.|$|R
5|$|An <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> injury forced Tanguay {{out of the}} Flames' line-up for 15 {{games in}} 2011–12. The team never {{identified}} the injury, which was speculated to be a concussion. He still finished third in team scoring, with 49 points in 64 games. Tanguay again finished third in team scoring in the lock-out-shortened 2012–13 NHL season, scoring 27 points in 40 games. On February 2, 2013, in a 3–2 shoot-out defeat to the Chicago Blackhawks, Tanguay registered his 500th career assist on a Dennis Wideman goal. His season was again impacted by injury, as he missed the Flames' final games of the campaign after suffering a sprained medial collateral ligament {{in a game against}} the Phoenix Coyotes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 11, Lindwall and his {{elder brother}} Jack were spectators at the Sydney Cricket Ground {{on the second day}} of the First Test of the 1932–33 Ashes series. The series saw the usage of the notorious Bodyline tactics by England's pace battery led by Harold Larwood under the {{captaincy}} of Douglas Jardine. Larwood, a small man like Lindwall, was less than six feet and intimidated opposition batsmen with express pace bowling, aiming short pitched bouncers at their <b>upper</b> <b>body.</b> Larwood also had a smooth, rhythmic run-up and a classical side-on action, something for which Lindwall became famous. The match was also remembered for Stan McCabe's much-celebrated 187 not out, aggressively resisting the Bodyline tactics as Australia fell to a heavy ten wicket defeat.|$|E
5|$|During {{the threat}} display, any sudden {{movement}} by the intruder may provoke the mamba {{into a series}} of rapid strikes leading to severe envenomation. Also, the size of the black mamba, plus its ability to raise its head well off the ground, enable it to launch as much as 40% of its body length upwards, so mamba bites in humans quite often are on the <b>upper</b> <b>body.</b> This behaviour also permits the snake to land a strike at unexpectedly long range. The black mamba's reputed readiness to attack is often much exaggerated and usually is provoked by perceived threats, such as blocking its intended retreat, accidentally or otherwise.|$|E
5000|$|Rodi or Rodiya {{are one of}} {{the widely}} {{reported}} untouchable social group or caste amongst the Sinhalese people of Sri Lanka. Their status was very similar to all the Untouchable castes of India with segregated communities, ritualized begging, eating off the refuse of upper castes and refusal for the women and men to cover their <b>upper</b> <b>bodies</b> [...]|$|R
2500|$|The male {{cast members}} exposed their <b>upper</b> <b>bodies</b> {{in keeping with}} Jasper Liu's promise to go topless if the drama surpasses the 2.00 rating average. The event was held at Sanlih {{headquarters}} rooftop garden. A water gun fight was held between the male cast and the two main female cast members before all the male cast took off their shirts.|$|R
50|$|Almaco jacks are {{generally}} dusky-colored with faint amber or olive stripes down their sides. Their <b>upper</b> <b>bodies</b> and lower fins are usually dark brown or dark blue-green. The belly is much lighter and appears brassy or lavender. The nuchal bar {{and most of}} the fins is dark on adults. Exceptions are the pelvic fins which are white on the ventral sides.|$|R
