50|$|The story {{centers on}} a {{conversation}} between Vincent Caulfield and his mother. His mother, an actress named Mary Moriarity, has hidden his draft survey. He finds it in the <b>utensil</b> <b>drawer,</b> and becomes angry at her for hiding it. As the conversation goes on, it is apparent his mother is just looking after his best interest. Her other son, Kenneth, {{was killed in the}} war and she wants to prevent this from happening again. Another sibling, a teenage boy named Holden, is mentioned. Interestingly, Vincent references his baseball mitt that is covered in poetry, similar to that of Allie in The Catcher in the Rye. At the close of the story, Vincent understands his mother's concern, but feels sorry for her solicitous behavior, and expresses depression over the fact she worries so much, particularly over kids who are about to fall off a cliff.|$|E
