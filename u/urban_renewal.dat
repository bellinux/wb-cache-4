5|$|<b>Urban</b> <b>renewal</b> {{programs}} are funded {{in part by}} federal grants. The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, which created the NRHP, requires that federal agencies give consideration to the opinions of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation in assessing the impact their actions will have on listed properties and consider alternatives to any action that would destroy or significantly affect them. The listings of downtown Troy's districts and buildings therefore had the practical effect of preventing their demolition for <b>urban</b> <b>renewal.</b>|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} Chicago Fire, the block {{was home to}} one of Chicago's largest theaters. During the late 19th century, tall office {{buildings}} proliferated on the block. By 1970, the block was densely developed with 11 buildings, housing theaters, offices, a YMCA, and retailers like Stop & Shop, a grocer. On June 14, 1973, Mayor Richard J. Daley announced a broad <b>urban</b> <b>renewal</b> initiative centered on the North Loop theater district. Over the ensuing 16 years, numerous private developers, notably the Rubloff Company and JMB Realty, planned large mixed-use developments on the site, with a mall along State Street and hotels and office towers above. Property assembly was facilitated by Mayor Harold Washington's creation of the North Loop tax increment financing district in 1983, which gave the <b>urban</b> <b>renewal</b> effort a steady revenue stream and eminent domain authority.|$|E

The park blocks underwent serious renovations in 1987, adding plazas, large flower beds, lighting and irrigation, and newly paved sidewalks. Several apartment complexes specifically aimed at the middle class were built, including the University Park Apartments (125 units, $10.5 million, quickly sold and converted to condos), South Park Square Apartments (184 units, $16 million, completed May 1988), and Tom Mesher's Gallery Park Apartments (31 units, $3 million). In 1987, the New Theater Building of the Portland Center for the Performing Arts was completed immediately next door to the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall. The South Park Blocks Association, a commercial and institutional association, was started at that time, to attract residents and consumers to the area and to address security concerns.|$|E

After various delays, those projects were either scaled back or abandoned entirely. In the interim many businesses either closed or moved out of downtown.|$|E
40|$|This paper takes a {{particular}} angle {{that begins with}} the drastic decline of internet cafés in China and their receding yet still evolving presence. This project aims at delineating the history of internet cafés as urban spaces {{in relation to the}} different roles they played in various stages of Chinese modernity. The particularities of local development, as directed by trajectories of Chinese modernization, has led to a contempt for the &# 039;low quality&# 039; of internet cafés, on the one hand, and a nostalgic sentimentalization of its ruination, on the other. Internet cafés are situated in the present moment of transition as a reflection of larger transformations of <b>urban</b> <b>renewals</b> and ideals of modernity. Drawn from both ethnographic research and existing literature on internet cafés, this paper theorizes the space that Chinese internet cafés have produced in the past 25 years...|$|R

5|$|After the war, {{the city}} {{underwent}} {{a process of}} <b>urban</b> <b>renewal</b> and expansion from the 1890s up to the 1920s. As downtown Lima had become overcrowded, the La Victoria residential area was established in 1896 as a working-class neighborhood. During this period the urban layout was modified by the construction of big avenues which crisscrossed the city and connected it with neighboring towns such as Miraflores. In the 1920s and 1930s, several buildings of the historic centre were rebuilt including the Government Palace and the Municipal Palace.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{progressive}} reforms were introduced during Colombo's time as prime minister.

A law of 30 December 1971 introduced new regulations covering protection of female workers and maternity insurance. The duration of maternity leave was extended two months prior to, and two months after confinement for all employees, and all female workers were entitled to an earnings-related indemnity, equal to 80% of earnings (including agricultural workers and tenant farmers). Also introduced was an entitlement to voluntary extra period of leave for six months during the first year of the child’s life, with job security and an indemnity equal to 30% of earnings, together with an entitlement to paid absences due to the child’s sickness during the first three years if the child’s life. In addition, a special natality allowance was introduced for self-employed women in the agricultural, artisan, and commercial sectors.|$|R

Backroom deals and personal relationships have often seemed to define the “public interest. ” This is the story of one attempt to give the public a voice in city planning and development. @TX: For over thirty years, the Philadelphia waterfront at Penn’s Landing has been stuck at the intersection of public interest and private development. A landfill built in 1976 as public space on the Delaware River, Penn’s Landing was conceived as a major destination that would bring visitors to the region. 1 The intervening years have seen many attempts to develop the site. Still, Penn’s Landing remains a mere vestige of <b>urban</b> <b>renewal’s</b> best intentions. Disconnected from the city by ten lanes of highway, the site has continually defied development.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the planning paradigm shift {{related to the}} contested “urban renaissance” mega-project in Downtown Seoul (Korea). Similar to other global cities, {{over the last few}} decades, different mega-projects have been successfully implemented in Seoul. These projects have been considered engines for <b>urban</b> <b>renewals</b> and transformation. This paper builds on the analysis of the failure and re-framing planning strategy for the Green Corridor (GC) mega-project, part of the “Urban Renaissance Master Plan for Downtown Seoul”. The GC case reveals various critical insights for urban sustainability: (i) the current mega-projects’ sustainability fallacy, related to top-down, technocratic densification, and greening practices; and (ii) the untapped potential of Asian traditional and irregular small scale urban patterns, and their related socio-cultural value in addressing the renaissance of the long term urban sustainability. In particular, the discussed research findings point out that urban renaissance enabling sustainability principles requires integrated, small scale, incremental, and adaptive (stepwise) urban planning and design processes that go well beyond general strategies following the so-called “green growth” paradigm...|$|R
5|$|At Oregon's request, the U.S. Congress {{stripped}} the slough of its navigable status in 1978. This ended channel dredging on the slough, which {{could then be}} used for recreation.

In 1986, a business association began promoting commercial development along the upper slough, and the city later used <b>urban</b> <b>renewal</b> funds to support industrial projects near the airport.

40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of Interstate 235 (I- 235) {{is the largest}} and the most expensive project {{in the history of}} the Iowa Department of Transportation. In order to accomplish this <b>urban</b> freeway <b>renewal</b> project, the Iowa Department of Transportation personnel need to know corridor-level information, such as durations, predecessors, and successors of construction projects, as they manage the design and construction process. They also need to know project-level information when communicating with the contractors, utility companies, and governmental agencies that are using detailed construction schedules. An appropriately customized corridor schedule, when updated consistently and distributed regularly, provides the necessary information.

This paper discusses the corridor schedule development, how it has been customized, updated, and distributed, as well as the research results and recommendations.
