Materials and methodsNinety freshly extracted intact maxillary first premolars were divided into nine groups of 10. One group was an <b>unprepared</b> <b>control.</b> Eight groups of teeth were prepared to create different widths and depths of mesial occlusal distal cavities. Subsequently, teeth were restored with either condensable composite resin or ceramic inlay. Specimens were then subjected to axial loading with a 4. 82 -mm diameter steel ball in a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 0. 5  mm/minute. Loads were applied against tooth structure, and the steel ball did not contact restorative material. Data were analyzed with multiple analysis of variance and Tukey post hoc testing. ResultsMean fracture load of teeth restored with Surefil and a 3 -mm cavity width was greater than in groups with a 2 -mm cavity width (P =  0. 0315). Teeth restored with ProCAD were observed to have significantly higher mean cusp fracture load compared to teeth restored with composite resin (P =  0. 0003).

Methodology  Two hundred mandibular premolar teeth were divided into four groups with similar average canal diameters (n = 50). One group was left untreated and served as the control. The other three groups were prepared with ProTaper rotary instruments up to size F 4. After preparation, one group was left unfilled while two groups were filled with gutta-percha and AH 26 using either lateral compaction or the continuous wave technique. Roots were then sectioned at 3, 6 and 9 mm from the apex and inspected under a microscope. The appearance of dentinal defects was noted {{as well as the}} minimum and mean remaining dentine thickness.

40|$|M. Sc. (Computer Science) A {{challenge}} faced when simulating {{the complex}} behaviour of cloth, especially at interactive frame rates, is maintaining {{an acceptable level}} of realism while keeping computation time to a minimum. A common method used to increase the performance is to decrease the number of nodes <b>controlling</b> the <b>cloth's</b> movement. This results in {{a significant decrease in}} the time taken to calculate each frame of the animation, but at the cost of sacrificing detail that can only be obtained using a dense discretisation of the cloth. A simple, efficient and popular method to simulate cloth is the mass-spring system, which utilises a regular grid of vertices representing discrete points along the cloth's surface. The structure of geometry images is similar, which makes them an ideal choice for representing arbitrary surface meshes in a cloth simulator whilst retaining the effciency of a mass-spring system. This dissertation presents a novel method of applying geometry images to cloth simulation in order to obtain cloth motion for surface meshes while retaining the simplicity of a massspring model. By adapting an implicit/explicit integration scheme, and utilising the regular structure of geometry images, an improvement in performance is achieved. Additionally, the cloth is able to drape over other objects, also represented as geometry images. The proposed method is efficient enough to allow fairly dense cloth meshes to be simulated in real-time...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the development of}} a robotic cell to perform assembly and handling operations on cloth. - A flexible automation approach was adopted, in which the robot was required to <b>control</b> the <b>cloth</b> panel during both handling and sewing operations, without the aid of hard automation attachments which might limit the flexibility of the system. The cell consisted of an adaptively controlled robot, a hierarchy of controllers, a conventional sewing machine, a two-fingered fabric steering end-effector, and several sensor systems. A technique was developed for producing a seam parallel to an edge of arbitrary contour, in which two cameras, a cloth tension sensor and the sewing machine's shaft encoder provided the sensory input. Two sensory servo control systems were required, one control system generated the robot's trajectory to maintain a small constant cloth tension, and the other directed the robot to manipulate the cloth panel to maintain a constant seam width. The design of the <b>cloth</b> tension <b>control</b> was based on the measured frequency response of the open loop system. The seam width control was designed using simulation studies, which accounted for the control transfer function, and nonlinearities such as camera pixel resolution, time delays and robot motion limitations. Several robotic handling techniques were developed, so that a cloth panel placed arbitrarily on the sewing table could be set up for an edge seaming operation, and the cloth could be rotated about the needle. The system's flexibility was demonstrated in the assembly of an irregularly shaped cloth panel, in which three adjacent sides were sewn up. ...|$|R

Results differ from previously published data by showing much higher indices of pressure activity with amplitudes up to 490 mmHg in IBS, and 450 mmHg in controls. Study segment activity index and mean pressure wave amplitudes were significantly (p less than 0. 015 and p less than 0. 01) higher in IBS than controls, but per cent duration of activity was similar for the whole period of study.

Objectives The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the incidence of dentinal micro-cracks following root canal preparations with ProTaper, Mtwo and Reciproc files. Materials and Methods In an experimental in vitro trial, 80 maxillary and mandibular first molars were selected and their crowns and distal roots were cut. The roots were then examined to remove any previous cracks and defects. An impression polyether material was used to simulate teeth periodontal ligament (PDL). The teeth were divided to four experimental groups (n = 20) and prepared using Reciproc, Mtwo and ProTaper or remained <b>unprepared</b> as a <b>control</b> group. The specimens were then sectioned horizontally on 3, 5 and 9 mm from the apex and number of micro-cracks was determined by stereomicroscope.

Possible management tools include mechanical site preparation (MSP), vegetation control (VC), and fertilization. Experimental plantations of hybrid poplars (one clone, Populus balsamea×Populus maximowiczii) were established at eight formerly forested sites on acidic soil in the southern boreal forest of Quebec, Canada. The objective was to test the response of hybrid poplars to the interaction of several silvicultural tools, which has been rarely done. FourMSPtreatments (in decreasing order of intensity: mounding, harrowing, heavy disk trenching, light disk trenching) and a <b>control</b> (<b>unprepared)</b> were all combined with four different frequencies of plant competition control by brushing (from never up to once a year). Fertilization with N or N+ P was also tested in three selected MSP treatments. After five years, hybrid poplar tree growth among MSP treatments increased in the following order: unprepared < light disk trenching < heavy disk trenching < harrowing < mounding. MSP was also essential in favouring early tree survival, as illustrated by mortality rates of over 20 % in unprepared plots and below 5 % in all other MSP treatments. The effect of competition control on hybrid poplar growth was greatest in the less intensive MSP treatments, where competing vegetation was the most abundant. On the contrary, fertilization effect was significant only in the most intensive MSP (mounding). Moreover, neither fertilization nor VC could compensate for inadequate soil preparation. Of all the silvicultural treatments tested, mounding provided the best tree growth despite a nitrogen and carbon impoverished surface soil...|$|R
40|$|Microbial electrosynthesis is a {{promising}} {{strategy for the}} microbial conversion of carbon dioxide to transportation fuels and other organic commodities, but optimization {{of this process is}} required for commercialization. Cathodes which enhance electrode–microbe electron transfer might improve rates of product formation. To evaluate this possibility, biofilms of Sporomusa ovata, which are effective in acetate electrosynthesis, were grown on a range of cathode materials and acetate production was monitored over time. Modifications of carbon cloth that resulted in a positive-charge enhanced microbial electrosynthesis. Functionalization with chitosan or cyanuric chloride increased acetate production rates 6 – 7 fold and modification with 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane gave rates 3 -fold higher than untreated controls. A 3 -fold increase in electrosynthesis over untreated carbon cloth cathodes was also achieved with polyaniline cathodes. However, not all strategies to provide positively charged surfaces were successful, as treatment of carbon cloth with melamine or ammonia gas did not stimulate acetate electrosynthesis. Treating carbon cloth with metal, in particular gold, palladium, or nickel nanoparticles, also promoted electrosynthesis, yielding electrosynthesis rates that were 6 -, 4. 7 - or 4. 5 -fold faster than the untreated control, respectively. Cathodes comprised of cotton or polyester fabric treated with carbon nanotubes yielded cathodes that supported acetate electrosynthesis rates that were [similar] 3 -fold higher than carbon <b>cloth</b> <b>controls.</b> Recovery of electrons consumed in acetate was [similar] 80 % for all materials.

40|$|Introduction The use {{of mobile}} devices within {{healthcare}} settings by staff, patients and visitors is widespread and growing. DoH guidance states that {{patients should be}} allowed the widest possible use of mobile phones. For staff mobile devices have become an essential aspect of their day-to-day professional and personal lives. There is, however, clear evidence that phones/tablets can be contaminated with pathogens, which may survive for prolonged periods before being transferred onto hands or other surfaces. This quantitative study evaluates {{the ability of a}} range of technologies to decontaminate iPads. Methods The front, back and sides of iPads were contaminated with a standard suspension of Staphylococcus aureus. Half of these surfaces were sampled to provide pre-values, whilst the other half was decontaminated with either alcohol wipes, detergent wipes, quaternary ammonium impregnated wipes, or exposure to Ultraviolet light for either 30 or 60 seconds. As a <b>control,</b> a microfibre <b>cloth</b> impregnated with sterile water was also tested. Results Alcohol based wipes were most effective, generating on average a 2 log reduction {{on the back of the}} iPad and a 3 log reduction on the front. The cleaning of the front surface of the iPad was consistently easier to clean that the back. However, all of the wipes were less effective than UV exposure, where a 60 second exposure generated a 4 log reduction on the front and a 3. 5 log reduction on the back. Discussion The results indicate that commercial wipes are unable to effectively decontaminate the high touch surfaces of an iPad. However, the application of a UV decontamination technology was a much more effective method for the removal of bacteria from these surfaces. This suggests that UV based decontamination technology would provide a quick, efficient and economical method for the disinfection of mobile devices such as iPads in healthcare settings...|$|R
40|$|Principals are {{instrumental}} in establishing effective schools and positive learning communities. There {{is only one}} principal in every school and thus, the position clearly requires a knowledgeable, highly skilled, and well-prepared individual. Principal training programs provide generally effective instruction that seemingly prepares emerging leaders for the expectations and logistical demands of the principalship. Yet {{the state of the}} profession is unstable. The research on principals shows that fewer administrators are applying for the position, newly hired principals are younger and less experienced, and longevity is a problem. The position is synonymous with long hours, little appreciation, and high stressful situations. Although principal preparation programs do address logistical problem solving, there is no curriculum for incoming principals that addresses the phenomenon of the unexpected event. Surprise events are stressful, salient, disruptive, and can make or break a career. A principal who is able to control an unexpected event, whether the event is caused by them or not, and foster an appropriate outcome likely feels strongly self-efficacious. On the other hand, principals who are faced with unexpected events and handle their own role in a manner that leads to a negative outcome, likely develop low self-esteem, low feelings of efficacy, {{and are more likely to}} leave the position or be ineffective leaders. This research project queried high and middle school principals from a moderate sized urban school district about whether they have experienced an unexpected event and if so, the details of that event were recorded. Specifically, qualitative descriptions were collected to develop an understanding of the variety of events that could and do occur during a principal's career. Using both quantitative and qualitative data collection, the research documented the principal's role, feelings, and self-reflections about the event. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the nature of unexpected events. The project also sought to discover, in depth, the personal experiences of the principal and the views of the principals about the event and outcome, and most importantly, the feelings of the principals about their role in the event and their role in the outcome. The investigation revealed several notable findings that linked event types and outcomes with principals' feelings.

After root canal therapy in 60 teeth, an acrylic laboratory bur was used to thin the cervical area and simulate the thin dentinal walls of immature teeth. The preparation was performed through the palatal access and extended 5 mm apical to CEJ. The remaining 12 teeth remained unprepared to serve as positive control group. Cases were randomly divided into six groups of 12 teeth each and restored as follows. In the 12 cervically <b>unprepared</b> teeth (positive <b>controls)</b> the composite resin with dentin bonding agent (DBA) was placed in access cavity and cured for 120 seconds. This technique was also applied to other groups when the access was restored with composite. In the second group, the access cavity was restored with composite only to the level of CEJ. In the third group the cervically prepared teeth were reinforced with cement resin (Enforce) and a prefabricated post was placed in 5 mm apical to the CEJ. In the fourth group, the cervically prepared teeth were reinforced with composite resin and DBA by a clear plastic post. In the fifth group the cervically prepared teeth were reinforced with composite resin and dba and a cast post. In the sixth group the cervically prepared teeth were restored with composite resin and dba with a prefabricated post. All of the specimens were mounted by rubberized technique and tested in the Instron universal testing machine. The fracture loads in samples were analyzed with ANOVA and Duncan tests with p< 0. 05 as the limit of significance. Results: Significant differences in fracture resistance were observed {{between the first and second}} groups compared with others. The highest fracture resistance values were recorded for first group while the lowest were registered for the second group. Fracture resistance of the third, fourth and fifth groups had no significant statistical differences with others and fracture resistance of sixth group was the highest with significant difference (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: From this study, it may be concluded that the use of a dba and a composite resin in thin-walled roots reinforces the immature teeth and facilitates the use of post...|$|R
5000|$|Third {{generation}} {{models were}} sold as the Plymouth Voyager, Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Town & Country. The Caravan and Voyager {{were available in}} either 3 or 4 door configurations on either a standard model or an extended wheelbase model known as the Grand Voyager and Grand Caravan, respectively. The Town & Country was only available in a long wheelbase configuration, with either 3 or 4 doors. Caravan trim levels were largely carried over from the previous generation, offered in Base, SE, and {{top of the line}} ES models, while a Sport package was available on short wheelbase SE models. Caravan ES models came with more options than before, featuring a standard Infinity sound system, a power driver's seat, dual-zone climate <b>control,</b> deluxe <b>cloth</b> seating (leather was optional) and alloy wheels, among other features. As part of Chrysler's new corporate strategy to better focus the Plymouth brand on entry-level vehicles, Voyagers and were only available in base trim and better-equipped SE models, although a high end LE trim which was largely a clone of the Caravan ES was available in Canada. A Rallye option package continued to be available on SE model, being the de facto top of the line Voyager. It was renamed [...] "Expresso" [...] for 1998. The Town & Country was now available in two different trims, the LX and LXi. On the Voyager and Caravan, the trims were easily distinguished by their body-side moldings. Base models used a narrow accent color strip and SE models used a wide accent color strip, with Voyager SEs with the Rallye package receiving [...] "Rallye" [...] badges on the front doors. Caravan ES and Voyager LEs used the base model's narrow accent color molding combined with a full accent color effect on the lower portion of the doors. The vinyl woodgrain-appearance side paneling was no longer available, as the new side sheetmetal was no longer flat. Early Plymouth Voyagers had a Pentastar front logo and rear badges using the same font as the Caravan, which was changed to Plymouth's new [...] "sailboat" [...] logo and script font on the badges by calendar year 1996. Voyagers and Caravans were only differentiated by their grilles, and some wheel options, while The Town & Country received plastic lower side cladding with chrome strips, unique wheels and a chrome waterfall grille with the Chrysler brand's new ribbon logo. Unique features for the Town & Country included as pre-programmed driver's seat and mirror, standard leather interior, 8-way power adjustable front seats, Infinity sound system with cassette/CD player. As with previous generations, the NS minivan was exported as the Chrysler Voyager, which was a Dodge Caravan modified to meet European safety and lighting standards, while for the 2000 model year it received the Plymouth Voyager's front fascia.In 1997, the Town & Country received standard dual sliding doors and a short wheelbase SX model (not available in Canada), and in 1998 it received a new front fascia, headlamps and wheels. Also in 1998, the Caravan SE dropped, replaced with a new [...] "Sport" [...] model that came with a completely color keyed body, rear spoiler and new wheels, and the Plymouth Voyager Rallye was renamed Expresso, while all models got grocery bag hooks installed on the rear seats. In 1999, the Caravan received standard dual sliding doors, as well as new front fascias, the ES model received revised trim, the [...] "AutoStick" [...] transmission and 17 inch wheels. With the discontinuation of the Plymouth brand, Voyagers produced late in the 2000 model year became Chrysler Voyagers, though they didn't receive any of the trim or options of the European export model.|$|R
