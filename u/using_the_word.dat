5|$|Starting in 1801, astronomers {{discovered}} Ceres {{and other}} bodies between Mars and Jupiter which were for decades {{considered to be}} planets. Between then and around 1851, {{when the number of}} planets had reached 23, astronomers started <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> asteroid for the smaller bodies and then stopped naming or classifying them as planets.|$|E
5|$|Corrector totius orientis (governor of {{the entire}} East): it is {{generally}} accepted by modern scholars that he bore this title. The corrector had an overall command of the Roman armies and authority over the Roman provincial governors in the designated region. There are no known attestations of the title during Odaenathus' lifetime. Evidences for the king bearing the title are two inscriptions in Palmyrene dialect; one posthumous dedication describing him as MTQNNʿ of the East (derived from the Aramaic root TQN, meaning to set in order), and the other describing his heir Vaballathus with the same title albeit <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> PNRTTʿ instead of MTQNNʿ.|$|E
5|$|Past {{experiences}} {{or general}} knowledge {{is often called}} upon in conversation, {{so it is a}} useful context for children to learn words. Recalling past experiences allows the child to call upon their own visual, tactical, oral, and/or auditory references. For example, if a child once went to a zoo and saw an elephant, but did not know the word elephant, an adult could later help the child recall this event, describing the size and color of the animal, how big its ears were, its trunk, and the sound it made, then <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> elephant to refer to the animal. Calling upon prior knowledge is used not only in conversation, but often in book reading as well to help explain what is happening in a story by relating it back to the child's own experiences.|$|E

5|$|Marge is irritated when Homer's snoring (so loud, it can {{be heard}} {{throughout}} most of the city) keeps her up at night. She sees Dr. Hibbert about the problem, and asks about a surgery, but he says it is expensive and tells them to get out when Homer asks him to do it for free. Developing a sleep problem, she sleeps for a night with Patty and Selma, and hears on the news that her old boyfriend, Artie Ziff, is one of America's five richest people. She drunkenly dictates an e-mail to Artie to congratulate him on his appearance, but Patty and Selma doctor it to use sexual terms in an attempt to split up Marge and Homer, much to Marge's horror (for <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> sex on the Internet). Artie, who over the years seems to have developed a rather frightening obsession with Marge (his house is decorated with a large number of 'Marge' sculptures/paintings), flies in his helicopter to the Simpson house to see Marge.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of Malaysia in 2007 outlawed {{usage of the}} term Allah in any other but Muslim contexts, but the Malayan High Court in 2009 revoked the law, ruling that it was unconstitutional. While Allah had been used for the Christian God in Malay {{for more than four}} centuries, the contemporary controversy was triggered by usage of Allah by the Roman Catholic newspaper The Herald. The government appealed the court ruling, and the High Court suspended implementation of its verdict until the appeal was heard. In October 2013, the court ruled in favor of the government's ban. In early 2014, the Malaysian government confiscated more than 300 bibles for <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> to refer to the Christian God in Peninsular Malaysia. However, the use of Allah is not prohibited in the two Malaysian state of Sabah and Sarawak. The main reason it is not prohibited in these two states is that usage has been long-established and local Alkitab (Bibles) have been widely distributed freely in East Malaysia without restrictions for years. Both states also do not have similar Islamic state laws as those in West Malaysia.|$|E

25|$|Use of fag and faggot as {{the term}} for an effeminate man has become {{understood}} as an Americanism in British English, primarily due to entertainment media use in films and television series imported from the United States.

25|$|Some {{commentators}} {{suggested that}} the film's producers reduced or hid aspects of its content pertaining to characters' sexualities in advertising and in public events, such as press conferences and award ceremonies. Journalists, including New York Daily News writer Wayman Wong, Dave Cullen and Daniel Mendelsohn, complained that the film's director, lead actors, and publicity team avoided <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> gay to describe the story, and noted that the film's trailer did not show a kiss between the two male leads but did show a heterosexual love scene.|$|E

25|$|Word for Windows is {{available}} stand-alone or {{as part of}} the Microsoft Office suite. Word contains rudimentary desktop publishing capabilities and is the most widely used word processing program on the market.

Word 6 for Windows NT was the first 32-bit version of the product, released with Microsoft Office for Windows NT around the same time as Windows 95. It was a straightforward port of Word 6.0. Starting with Word 95, releases of Word were named after the year of its release, instead of its version number.|$|E

25|$|In I and Thou, Buber {{introduced}} his thesis on human existence. Inspired by Feuerbach's The Essence of Christianity and Kierkegaard's Single One, Buber worked upon {{the premise of}} existence as encounter. He explained this philosophy <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> pairs of Ich-Du and Ich-Es to categorize the modes of consciousness, interaction, and being through which an individual engages with other individuals, inanimate objects, and all reality in general. Theologically, he associated the first with the Jewish Jesus and the second with the apostle Paul (formerly Saul of Tarsus, a Jew). Philosophically, these word pairs express complex ideas about modes of being—particularly how a person exists and actualizes that existence. As Buber argues in I and Thou, a person is at all times engaged with the world {{in one of these}} modes.|$|E
25|$|The first {{trademark}} {{application for}} UGG in the United States was filed by Brian Smith’s company in 1984. In the 1990s, Smith and then Deckers secured additional registrations in the U.S. and other countries. In 1999, Deckers began asserting its new trademark and sent out {{cease and desist}} letters to Australian manufacturers that were selling sheepskin boots outside of Australia via the internet. By the early 2000s, demand for UGG boots was soaring with Australian and U.S.-based manufacturers selling sheepskin boots over the Internet. There was confusion among consumers between generic ugg boots made in Australia and Deckers' UGG brand boots. Deckers' law firm Middletons of Melbourne began a serious effort to halt the Australian companies' sales by sending cease and desist letters {{to a number of}} Australian and U.S. based manufacturers, preventing them from selling sheepskin boots using the UGG trademark on eBay or from <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> in their registered business names or domain names. Deckers initiated numerous domain name actions under the UDRP.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{principal}} reasons for concern about Ashton's {{translation of the}} title. Firstly, 'Judaism' in English carries the meaning of 'the profession or practice of the Jewish religion; the religious system or the polity of the Jews', a topic on which Wagner does not touch. 'Judentum' however in 19th-century Germany carried a much broader meaning—roughly analogous to the nonce English word 'Jewdom' (cf. Christendom) and including {{the concept of the}} social practices of the Jews. In particular it carried the pejorative sense of 'haggling' or 'marketeering'—it was used in this sense for example by Karl Marx. Undoubtedly Wagner wished to refer to this sense, in effect <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> as a pun, as the commercialism implied forms the topic of the essay as a whole. It is therefore important to bear in mind the full range of implications of the title-word 'Judentum' in considering the essay as a whole. 'Jewishness', whilst not ideal, is perhaps a closer English approximation to 'Judentum' than 'Judaism'.|$|E
