Mr. Irving had placed all his research material in two trunks that were shipped from New Delhi to Hartford. Upon his return to Yale in 1969, he discovered that Pan American World Airways had lost his research. The airline permitted Mr. Irving to visit John F. Kennedy Airport to search through 16 acres (not 60, as stated in a news article) of <b>unclaimed</b> <b>luggage.</b> He was able to locate one trunk, but the contents had become damaged and useless because {{of exposure to the}} weather. Mr. Irving filed a successful $15,000 (not $35,000, as stated in a press article) lawsuit in order to recoup expenses accrued on his return to India to redo his entire research and photography. Discovered too late to be of use, the second trunk surfaced at a Boston airport warehouse after more than four years.|$|E
