25|$|Several {{months before}} the Democratic and Republican conventions, Perot filled the vacuum of {{election}} news, as his supporters began petition drives to {{get him on the}} ballot in all 50 states. This sense of momentum was reinforced when Perot employed two savvy campaign managers in Democrat Hamilton Jordan and Republican Ed Rollins. In July, while Perot was pondering whether to run for office, his supporters established a campaign organization <b>United</b> <b>We</b> Stand America. Perot was late in making formal policy proposals, but most of what he did call for were intended to reduce the deficit, such as a gasoline tax increase and cutbacks to Social Security.|$|E
500|$|Jackson's {{appearance}} {{during the}} [...] "What More Can I Give" [...] performance was later edited out of American Broadcasting Company's airing of the show. The company {{were forced to}} take the action after representatives of Jackson informed them that CBS had demanded that the singer not perform on a network show before a Jackson special being broadcast on their channel the following month. CBS executives, however, denied their insistence on Jackson's removal from the footage. They stated that if the singer {{had appeared in the}} broadcast footage, they most probably would have been forced to delay Jackson's show, so that it would not appear too soon after the airing of <b>United</b> <b>We</b> Stand: What More Can I Give.|$|E
500|$|By mid-July, the Washington Post {{reported}} that Perot's campaign managers were becoming increasingly disillusioned by his unwillingness {{to follow their}} advice {{to be more specific}} on issues, and his need to be in full control of operations with such tactics as forcing volunteers to sign loyalty oaths. Perot's poll numbers began to slip to 25%, and his advisers warned that if he continued to ignore them, he would fall into single digits. Co-manager Hamilton Jordan threatened to quit, and on July 15, Ed Rollins resigned after Perot fired advertisement specialist Hal Riney, who worked with Rollins on the Reagan campaign. Rollins later claimed that a member of the campaign accused him of being a Bush plant with ties to the CIA. Amidst the chaos, Perot's support fell to 20%. The next day, Perot announced on Larry King Live that he would not seek the presidency. He explained {{that he did not want}} the House of Representatives to decide the election if the result caused the electoral college to be split. He asked his supporters to look for other candidates to nominate for the race, and formed <b>United</b> <b>We</b> Stand to [...] "influence the debate." [...] At this point, Perot had spent $12 million of his own money on the race. Bill Hillsman, who produced a few unaired advertisements for the campaign, wrote that Perot's withdrawal was a tactic to find temporary relief from the press.|$|E
