5|$|After Burke's first {{campaign}} for alderman, {{he has been}} unopposed in most of his re-election campaigns. In 2007, Burke faced his first opponent since 1971, a school teacher who had never run for office. A Burke supporter unsuccessfully challenged {{the validity of the}} opponent's ballot application, but the case was tied <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>court</b> for most of the campaign, and Burke went on to win with nearly 90 percent of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Dot {{moves in}} with fellow senior citizen Lilly Mattock (Barbara Keogh) and is arrested for the illegal use of cannabis, which she confuses for herbal tea. When Lilly leaves after she is mugged, Dot moves in with Pauline. Her oldest friend Ethel also comes {{to stay with}} the Fowlers for a time, having become terminally ill. Ethel begs Dot to help her end her life. Torn between her Christian beliefs against {{euthanasia}} and her best friend's wishes, she helps Ethel to die, but later feels she should be jailed for murder. When the police do not believe her story, Dot demands retribution in another form and she ends <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>court</b> for shoplifting. She initially avoids a prison sentence but is sent down for 14 days for contempt of court following an outburst in the courtroom.|$|E
5|$|Evans and {{his agents}} set about aggressively {{collecting}} royalties from those using his designs. Furthermore, Evans significantly raised the license fees for {{his use of}} his patented technology, raising claims of extortion from those being asked to pay, and a great many cases ended <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>court.</b> The 1808 act had indemnified those who had adopted Evans's technologies from 1805 to 1808, but did not specify whether this indemnity was perpetual (as defendants argued) {{or whether it was}} only for the three years in question (as Evans argued). Evans by this stage of his life had also established a poor reputation for himself amongst the milling community, and his abrasive and often petty pursuit of patent rights stiffened resistance. Several major legal cases questioned whether laws to extend private patents in this manner were even constitutional, but Evans ultimately prevailed in each case.|$|E

5|$|Gonne's {{marriage}} to MacBride was a disaster. This pleased Yeats, as Gonne began {{to visit him}} in London. After {{the birth of her}} son, Seán MacBride, in 1904, Gonne and MacBride agreed to end the marriage, although they were unable to agree on the child's welfare. Despite the use of intermediaries, a divorce case ensued in Paris in 1905. Gonne made a series of allegations against her husband with Yeats as her main 'second', though he did not attend court or travel to France. A divorce was not granted, for the only accusation that held <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>court</b> was that MacBride had been drunk once during the marriage. A separation was granted, with Gonne having custody of the baby and MacBride having visiting rights.|$|E

25|$|The USFL had {{initially}} followed the NFL and banned underclassmen. However, league officials concluded the rule would never stand <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>court,</b> and discarded it. To circumvent the league's $1.8-million salary cap, Walker signed a personal services contract with Duncan (later transferred to Donald Trump). Similar arrangements were later made with other college stars. Although this move was challenged in court, Walker and the USFL prevailed.|$|E
25|$|The sharing {{agreement}} between the cricket and footy clubs was not all rosy, and by the late 1890s the two entities ended <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>court</b> over a dispute {{about the use of}} the cricket pavilion by a visiting football team. The court ruled in favour of the cricket club citing that since it was Crown land, it was illegal to fence off any part of it for the benefit of either party.|$|E
25|$|Foreign Minister Stephen Smith was {{unavailable}} {{for an interview}} but the Department of Foreign Affairs issued an extensive statement welcoming the group home, but pointed out that before travelling, Australians needed to inform themselves about {{the laws of the}} countries they planned to visit.

The statement then stated that the Australian Government registered its strong interest in the case being handled expeditiously with the Indonesian Government.|$|E

When showing <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>court,</b> Genco Russo presented petitions from prominent politicians, priests, bankers, doctors, lawyers and businessman who declared to testify on his behalf. His lawyer threatened to publish telegrams from 37 Christian Democratic deputies – one a cabinet minister – thanking Genco Russo for helping them to get elected. Minister and prominent DC politician Bernardo Mattarella denied that he had been sent one. Genco Russo was sentenced to five years confinement by the Court of Caltanissetta, and sent to Lovere, near Bergamo.|$|E
25|$|In 1883 {{the most}} {{prominent}} trustee, Sheridan, regarding the ground as {{the responsibility of the}} trustees, began to act independently of the NSWCA, resulting in the NSWCA losing control of the ground. Over the next century there was constant conflict between the Trust and the NSWCA over whether other sports such as rugby, tennis and cycling, the organisers of which were all keen to use the venue, had access to it. One conflict in 1904, over the Trust's plan to hold a cycling event which clashed with a cricket match, ended <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>court.</b> The NSWCA's influence was eventually reduced even further over the years due to changes in the way the State Government appointed trustees.|$|E
25|$|On {{one visit}} to Benalla in 1876, Dan {{was arrested for}} {{stealing}} a saddle. The police let him go when they could not get enough evidence. Dan and his cousins got into trouble with the police in October 1877. They {{had gone to a}} shop to pick up food and other supplies, but the shop was shut. When the owner refused to open the shop, Dan Kelly broke down the door. They were charged with violent assault, damage to property (the door), breaking into houses and stealing things worth £113. The boys went into hiding, and the police spent three weeks looking for them. Constable Alexander Fitzpatrick told Ned Kelly to get them to give themselves <b>up.</b> <b>In</b> <b>court,</b> the police were not able to prove most of the charges, but Dan went to prison for one month for damaging property worth £10.|$|E

25|$|Pataki's term {{had been}} marked with annual debates with the State Legislature over the powers {{allocated}} to the Executive and Legislative Branches on {{the adoption of the}} state budget. Pataki argued that the state constitution and court rulings gave him the power to submit a budget that allocated revenue and set policy. Pataki said the Legislature could then only change the numbers but could not change any policy decisions made in the budget document. Pataki and the Legislature ended <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>court</b> and the courts ruled in Pataki's favor, giving him more budgetary power. In 2005, the Legislature placed a constitutional amendment on the ballot to allocate more budget power to them. Pataki led a successful public information campaign to defeat this provision and to retain his budget authority. In 2006, Pataki vetoed {{a large part of the}} budget adopted by the Legislature because of these rulings.|$|E
25|$|The trial against Bevan Spencer von Einem for {{the murder}} of Richard Kelvin opened at the Supreme Court Building of South Australia on 15 October 1984 before Mr. Justice White. A jury of 12 people (seven women and five men) were {{selected}} and were agreed upon by the prosecution and defence. Einem pleaded not guilty, and his defence was led by barrister Barry Jennings, who was assisted by Helena Jasinski, who had been Einem's solicitor {{from the start of the}} police investigation of him in the murder during the previous year. The prosecution was led by Brian Martin QC (later the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory), with assistance from Paul Rofe QC (who went on to be Director of the Department of Public Prosecutions). For the prosecution, it was a matter of proving Einem's guilt (along with that of unknown persons) by presenting the strong scientific evidence that had been gathered during the investigation, and disproving Einem's story of being in contact with Richard Kelvin on the night of 5 June 1983. For the defence, it was a case of trying to make Einem's story hold <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>court,</b> and raising doubts about his ability to keep Richard Kelvin captive for five weeks and committing the murder.|$|E

Some sailors from Constitution joined Chesapeake and they filled the crew along with sailors of several nations.|$|E
500|$|Birkett {{arrived in}} court two hours late. In his defence, {{he tried to}} claim that the {{relationships}} between women in The Well of Loneliness were purely platonic in nature. Biron replied, [...] "I have read the book." [...] Hall had urged Birkett before the trial not to [...] "sell the inverts in our defence". She took advantage of a lunch recess to tell him that if he continued to maintain her book had no lesbian content she would stand <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>court</b> and tell the magistrate the truth before anyone could stop her. Birkett was forced to retract. He argued instead that the book was tasteful and possessed a high degree of literary merit. James Melville, appearing for Leopold Hill, took a similar line: the book was [...] "written in a reverend spirit", not to inspire libidinous thoughts but to examine a social question. The theme itself should not be forbidden, and the book's treatment of its theme was unexceptionable.|$|E

Gregson who plays him opined that in Kylie's mind she thought [...] "that fat bald guy wants a bit". He also said that Steve was [...] "extremely shocked" [...] but was not interested. Steve decides not to say anything to Becky because he doesn't trust Kylie and knows that she will take Max away from Becky.
