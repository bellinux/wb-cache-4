5|$|As {{early as}} the late 1950s, plans for a Tulsa freeway system {{included}} a route along 96th Street South. The 96th Street corridor was accessible to more motorists than other corridors further south (farther away from the <b>urban</b> <b>core),</b> while still having low right-of-way costs, comparable to more southerly corridors. This made it the ideal route for a south Tulsa freeway. In 1986, ODOT had {{plans to build a}} toll-free facility called the Creek Freeway in the corridor as part of SH-117.|$|E

40|$|Residential {{development}} is a dynamic process, as changes in housing stock vary substantially over space and time. These spatiotemporal dynamics are expected to differ in various hierarchical levels of <b>urban</b> areas. <b>Urban</b> <b>cores,</b> peri-urban areas and predominantly rural areas are likely to experience different housing development processes as the economic and demographic drivers of change are different in these areas. To obtain {{a deeper understanding of}} recent changes in urban development, we analyse the residential stock development in the Netherlands, measured as the number of housing units available. At the national level housing stock is continuously growing at a fairly stable rate of 1. 1 %. Disaggregating the national data into different hierarchical levels we find that in absolute numbers <b>urban</b> <b>cores</b> are growing more than peri-urban areas. However, in relative terms, peri-urban areas are growing faster than <b>urban</b> <b>cores.</b> At the regional level we find substantial differences between different geographical zones. The Randstad—the western and most urbanized region of the country—is growing more than the other regions. This is the only region, however, where residential stock in peri-urban zones grew faster than their associated <b>urban</b> <b>cores.</b> Testing the different regions and hierarchical levels for their correspondence with the generally accepted Gibrat’s law of proportionate growth, we find that the <b>urban</b> <b>cores</b> in the Randstad are growing less than could be expected from their initial size. Their peri-urban areas, on the other hand, are growing faster than their initial size would suggest. These findings hint a degree of saturation of the current <b>urban</b> <b>cores</b> in this region and a spill-over of residential development into their peri-urban areas. The study is complemented by an explanatory analysis linking socio-economic indicators and physical planning criteria (such as the amount of land available for the development and the presence of restrictive policies) to the observed residential stock development...|$|R

5|$|At {{the bottom}} of the hill, I-196 enters the <b>urban</b> <b>core</b> of Grand Rapids. The freeway runs eastward through {{residential}} neighborhoods on the city's west side as it approaches the interchange with US131. This complex structure is adjacent to the Grand River north of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum. The carriageways for I-196 run through the interchange on different levels, with the eastbound traffic carried down near river level and the westbound lanes above the criss-crossing carriageways of US131's freeway. I-196 crosses the river {{on the opposite side of}} the interchange and both directions return to the same level. The freeway picks up an additional lane at this point as the median is replaced by a concrete barrier.|$|E
5|$|Greater Manchester, United Kingdom, was {{considering}} a scheme with two cordons, one covering the main <b>urban</b> <b>core</b> of the Greater Manchester Urban Area and another covering the Manchester city centre. The measure {{was supported by}} the government, but three local authorities rejected it (Bury, Trafford and Stockport); the support of two-thirds of Manchester's 10 local councils was needed for it to be implemented. A comprehensive transport investment package for Manchester, which included the congestion pricing element, was released for further public consultation and was to be subject of a referendum in December 2008. On 12 December 2008 the scheme was overwhelmingly rejected by 10 out of 10 councils by a public referendum.|$|E

Metrorail connects to the Metromover in Downtown, which provides metro service to the entirety of Downtown and Brickell. Additionally, it connects to South Florida's commuter rail system at Tri-Rail Station, as well as Metrobus routes at all stations. Together with Metromover, the system has seen steady ridership growth per annum, {{with an average of}} 105,500 daily passengers in 2013.|$|E
5|$|San Diego's roadway system {{provides}} an extensive network of cycle routes. Its dry and mild climate makes cycling a convenient year-round option; however, the city's hilly terrain and long average trip distances make cycling less practicable. Older and denser neighborhoods around the downtown {{tend to be}} utility cycling oriented. This is {{partly because of the}} grid street patterns now absent in newer developments farther from the <b>urban</b> <b>core,</b> where suburban style arterial roads are much more common. As a result, a majority of cycling is recreational. In 2006, San Diego was rated the best city (with a population over 1 million) for cycling in the U.S.|$|E

In addition to Halifax Regional Municipality's <b>urban</b> <b>core,</b> the town of Truro and all of rural Colchester County {{as well as the}} western part of Pictou County experienced {{property damage}} and power outages from falling trees; numerous barns and other agricultural buildings were damaged east of the storm's path, including a replica of the Hector in Pictou Harbour. The severity of property damage in the metropolitan areas of Halifax and Dartmouth of Halifax Regional Municipality initially led some forecasters to believe that Juan was likely a Category3 hurricane; however, the sustained wind reports did not justify that suggestion. Many of the deciduous trees in central Nova Scotia still had leaves, which magnified the effects of wind damage. Overall, the number of damaged trees was estimated to be in the millions.|$|E
5|$|Norfolk's {{city leaders}} began a long push to revive its <b>urban</b> <b>core.</b> While Granby Street {{underwent}} decline, Norfolk city leaders {{focused on the}} waterfront and its collection of decaying piers and warehouses. Many obsolete shipping and warehousing facilities were demolished. In their place, planners created a new boulevard, Waterside Drive, along which many of the high-rise buildings in Norfolk's skyline have been erected. In 1983, the city and The Rouse Company developed the Waterside festival marketplace to attract people back to the waterfront and catalyze further downtown redevelopment. Other facilities opened in the ensuing years, including the Harbor Park baseball stadium, home of the Norfolk Tides Triple-A minor league baseball team. In 1995, the park was named the finest facility in minor league baseball by Baseball America. Norfolk's efforts to revitalize its downtown have attracted acclaim from economic development and urban planning circles throughout the country. Downtown's rising fortunes helped to expand the city's revenues and allowed the city to direct attention to other neighborhoods.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1990s archaeological {{research}} at Gedi and other Swahili coastal settlements has intensified. From the 1980s archaeological research increasingly {{began to focus}} more on the relationships between the coastal communities and their internal development, challenging the original notion that the development of the Swahili Coast was driven by foreign influence through Indian Ocean trade or by Arab colonists. Another important development in the study of Swahili coastal sites is the increased attention given to remains of structures that were not built of stone. Surveys of the open terrain at Gedi found dense concentrations of mud-thatched dwellings. In 2001, Stephane Pradines from the Institute Francias d'Archeologie Orientale and archaeologists from the National Museum of Kenya conducted a topographical survey of Gedi, which mapped the distribution of neighborhoods in order to investigate the site's urban development. Concurrently, Lynn Koplin conducted surveys of the mud-thatch neighborhoods, focusing on the area between the inner and outer walls. From 2002 to 2003, {{research at}} Gedi continued to focus on urban development prior to the fifteenth century, with focus on a group of coral houses built by social elites in the site's <b>urban</b> <b>core.</b>|$|E

40|$|Following the Great Recession (2007 – 2009), {{growth in}} multiunit housing starts has been {{exceptionally}} strong and sustained. In this study, we examine empirical evidence for three possible explanations, namely, {{the passage of}} Baby Boomers into senior years, the depressed economic conditions, and rising preference of recent birth cohorts for residing in <b>urban</b> <b>cores.</b> Applying Age-Period-Cohort analysis to census data on multiunit housing occupancy from 1970 to 2010, we find {{evidence to support the}} explanations that a sharp increase in demand from Millennials drawn to <b>urban</b> <b>cores</b> and retiring Baby Boomers are contributing to the growth in multiunit housing starts. The results provide weak evidence of a negative relationship between depressed economic conditions and demand for multiunit housing starts. Over the long term, demand for multiunit housing can be expected to moderate {{as a result of the}} projected aging of the population...|$|R
5|$|The {{economy of}} Aarhus is {{predominantly}} knowledge and service based, {{strongly influenced by}} the University of Aarhus and the large healthcare industry. The service sector dominates the economy and is growing as the city is transitioning away from manufacturing. Trade and transportation remain important sectors benefiting from the large port and central position on the rail network. Manufacturing has been in slow but steady decline since the 1960s while agriculture long has been a marginal employer within the municipality. The municipality is home to 175,000 jobs with some 100,000 {{in the private sector}} and the rest split between state, region and municipality. The region is a major agricultural producer, with many large farms in the outlying districts. People commute to Aarhus {{from as far away as}} Randers, Silkeborg and Skanderborg and almost a third of those employed within Aarhus municipality commute from neighbouring communities. Aarhus is a centre for retail in the Nordic and Baltic countries with expansive shopping centres, the busiest commercial street in the country and a dense <b>urban</b> <b>core</b> with many speciality shops.|$|E
