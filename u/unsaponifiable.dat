Using a model KDL 6 MD glass still with a 0. 06 m 2 evaporator, five passes were conducted using different evaporator temperatures and with the condenser temperature held at 60 °C and vacuum at 0. 22 mmHg. With the feed rate of 0. 2 kg/hr, at a temperature of 60 °C, samples of the CODD were separated into the distillate and residue portion. Using a gas chromatography silylation method, quantification of the components was determined. The pass 4 distillate was composed of 90. 8 % of FFA and 4. 3 % of <b>unsaponifiables</b> and the residue had 63 % <b>unsaponifiables.</b> Using this residue for stage- 2, <b>unsaponifiables</b> were 84. 5 % of the distillate while the residue had 97. 14 % diglycerides.

50|$|Sesame oil is a {{polyunsaturated}} (PUFA) semi-drying oil. Commercial {{sesame oil}} varies in colour from light to deep reddish yellow {{depending on the}} colour of the seed processed and the method of milling. Provided the oil is milled from well-cleaned seed, it can be refined and bleached easily to yield a light-coloured limpid oil. Sesame oil is rich in oleic and linoleic acids, which together account for 85% of the total fatty acids. Sesame oil has a relatively high percentage of <b>unsaponifiable</b> matter (1.5-2.3%) in India and in some other European countries. It is obligatory to add sesame oil (5-10%) to margarine and generally to hydrogenated vegetable fats which are commonly used as adulterants for butter or ghee.|$|E
50|$|Rice bran is a {{byproduct}} of the rice milling process (the conversion of brown rice to white rice), and it contains various antioxidants that impart beneficial effects on human health. A major rice bran fraction contains 12%-13% oil and highly <b>unsaponifiable</b> components (4.3%). This fraction contains tocotrienols (a form of vitamin E), gamma-oryzanol and beta-sitosterol; all these constituents {{may contribute to the}} lowering of the plasma levels of the various parameters of the lipid profile. Rice bran also contains a high level of dietary fibres (beta-glucan, pectin and gum). In addition, it also contains ferulic acid, which is also a component of the structure of nonlignified cell walls. However, some research suggests there are levels of inorganic arsenic (a toxin and carcinogen) present in rice bran. One study found the levels to be 20% higher than in drinking water. Other types of bran (derived from wheat, oat or barley) contain less arsenic than rice bran, and are just as nutrient-rich.|$|E
50|$|In general, {{the tall}} oil {{produced}} in coastal {{areas of the}} southeastern United States contains over 40% resin acids and sometimes as much as 50% or more. The fatty acids fraction is usually lower than the resin acids, and unsaponifiables amount to 6-8%. Farther north in Virginia, where Pitch Pine (Pinus rigida)and Shortleaf Pine (Pinus echinata) are more dominant, the resin acid content decreases to as low as 30-35% with a corresponding increase in the fatty acids present. In Canada, where mills process Lodgepole Pine (Pinus contorta) in interior British Columbia and Alberta, Jack Pine (Pinus banksiana), Alberta to Quebec and Eastern White Pine (Pinus strobus) and Red Pine (Pinus resinosa), Ontario to New Brunswick, resin acid levels of 25% are common with <b>unsaponifiable</b> contents of 12-25%. Similar variations {{may be found in}} other parts of the United States and in other countries.

40|$|Grain {{amaranth}} {{has been}} suggested {{as an alternative to}} marine animals as a natural source of squalene. Oil contents, squalene contents, and fatty acid profiles were determined in 11 genotypes of four grain amaranth species. Although the oil contents of grain amaranth were low (from 5. 1 % in Amaranthus tricolor to 7. 7 % in Amaranthus cruentus) as compared to other oil-containing grains, high concentrations of squalene were found in total lipids, ranging from 3. 6 % in Amaranthus hypochondriacus to 6. 1 % in A. tricolor. The major fatty acids in Amaranthus oil consisted of palmitic acid (19. 1 - 23. 4 %), oleic acid (18. 7 - 38. 9 %), and linoleic acid (36. 7 - 55. 9 %). A high degree of unsaturation was observed in Amaranthus oils, with S/U ratios of 0. 26 - 0. 32. A method to isolate and purify the squalene from Amaranthus oil was developed. After the saponification of K 112, the squalene content increased from 4. 2 % in the crude oil to 43. 3 % in the <b>unsaponifiables</b> by the removal of the saponifiables. The <b>unsaponifiables</b> were fractionated by silica gel column chromatography to get highly purified squalene. The squalene purity in certain fractions was as high as 98 %.

At concentrations of 3. 3 and 6. 6 microg/ml, A/S residues, tested separately, were potent inhibitors of the production of IL- 8 and PGE 2. Nevertheless, only avocado residue inhibited IL- 6 production at these concentrations.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} avocado (A) /soybean (S) <b>unsaponifiables</b> on the metabolism of human osteoarthritic (OA) chondrocytes cultured in alginate beads over 12 days. METHODS: Enzymatically isolated OA chondrocytes were cultured in alginate beads in a well defined culture medium for 12 days, in the presence or not of 10 - 10 M interleukin 1 beta (IL- 1 beta). DNA content was measured using a fluorometric method. Production of aggrecan (AGG), stromelysin- 1 (MMP- 3), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases- 1 (TIMP- 1), macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 beta (MIP- 1 beta), IL- 6, and IL- 8 were assayed by specific enzyme amplified sensitivity immunoassays. Prostaglandin (PG) E 2 was measured by a specific radioimmunoassay and nitrite by a spectrophotometric method based on the Griess reaction. A commercial avocado and soybean mixture of <b>unsaponifiables</b> (A 1 S 2) and each component separately were tested {{in a range of}} 0. 625 to 40. 0 micro g/ml. RESULTS: After 12 days' incubation, A 1 S 2 increased AGG synthesis and accumulation in alginate beads in a dose and time dependent manner. A 1 S 2 promoted the recovery of aggrecan synthesis after 3 days of IL- 1 beta treatment. A 1 S 2 was a potent inhibitor of basal and IL- 1 beta stimulated MMP- 3 production. The procedure also weakly reversed the inhibitory effect of IL- 1 beta on TIMP- 1 production. A 1 S 2 inhibited basal production of MIP- 1 beta, IL- 6, IL- 8, NO*, and PGE 2 by OA chondrocytes and partially counteracted the stimulating effect of IL- 1 on PGE 2. Compared to avocado or soybean added separately, the mixture had a superior effect on NO* and IL- 8 production. CONCLUSION: A 1 S 2 stimulated aggrecan production and restored aggrecan production after IL- 1 beta treatment. In parallel, A 1 S 2 decreased MMP- 3 production and stimulated TIMP- 1 production. These results suggest A 1 S 2 could have structure-modifying effects in OA by inhibiting cartilage degradation and promoting cartilage repair. Peer reviewe...|$|R
