[...] The first paper studied the discounted two-person zero-sum stochastic game with finitely many states and actions and demonstrates {{the existence of}} a value and stationary optimal strategies.

The existence of an <b>undiscounted</b> value in a very strong sense, both a uniform value and a limiting average value, was proved in 1981 by Jean-François Mertens and Abraham Neyman. The study of the non-zero-sum with a general state and action spaces attracted much attention, and Mertens and Parthasarathy proved a general existence result under the condition that the transitions, {{as a function of the}} state and actions, are norm continuous in the actions.|$|E

5000|$|The {{reason for}} uranium {{exploration}} and uranium mining in northern Arizona, {{during a period}} of low yellowcake price, was the high grade and compact nature of the uranium mineralization contained in some of the collapse breccia pipes in the region. In 1982, total production cost for breccia pipe uranium was about $10/lb U308 concentrate that then sold for approximately $40/lb. [...] Later inflation-corrected cost data published by EFN in the Canyon Mine Environmental Impact Statement confirms the 1982 total cost quotation. In 2007 US dollar terms, the total cost to produce a pound of U308 from the average pipe was about $24. Average ore reserves for an individual mineralized pipe at that time were determined to be about 3.5 million pounds U308, with an average grade of about 0.6 percent U308, then giving the average economically mineralized pipe an approximate before-tax, <b>undiscounted</b> in-ground value of about $105 million (more than $225 million in 2007 US dollars).http://pubs.usgs.gov/bul/b2004/html/bull2004model_for_solutioncollapse_brecc.htm The breccia pipe mineral deposits range from 1000 to 1800 feet deep and have a vertical extent of up to 600 feet. The pipes typically have a 200 to 400 ft diameter. A 1000 to 1600 ft shaft is usually required to access the deposits. In some cases where a mineralized pipe occurs near a deep canyon, a decline can be used instead of a shaft to access the ore during mining.|$|E

40|$|<b>Undiscounted</b> utilitarianism as a {{criterion}} of intergeneration justice has been questioned for different reasons: It has been argued (1) that any complete ordering of allocations with {{an infinite number of}} generations guaranteeing an optimal allocation must involve discounting, and (2) that <b>undiscounted</b> utilitarianism subjects the present generation to heavy demands and leads to outcomes that do not appeal to our ethical intuitions. In a previous work (Asheim, Buchholz & Tungodden, forthcoming in J. Env. Econ. Man.) we have shown that equal treatment of different generations is not incompatible with the existence of maximal allocations, given that one considers technologies that are productive (in a given sense). In this paper we consider the second argument. We show within three classes of technologies (linear, Ramsey and Dasgupta-Heal-Solow tech-nologies) that <b>undiscounted</b> utilitarianism is so malleable that any efficient and non-decreasing allocation can be the unique optimum given the utilitarian criterion, provided that the utility function is appropriately chosen. Hence, <b>undiscounted</b> utilitarianism allows for optimal allocations and need not lead to unequal distributions imposing a too heavy burden on the present generation.

In the <b>undiscounted</b> case, however, it is of the form that the present value prices are bounded above along the path.
