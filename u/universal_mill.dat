In 1899 he resigned the management of these works and founded at Rath the firm of Sack, Limited, {{to the development of}} which, {{to the end of his}} life, the whole of his activities were devoted. Here he found great scope for his remarkable talent as an engineer, and ample opportunity to realise his inventive genius in the construction of machinery of all kinds, and more especially rolling-mills. Among other inventions he was successful in perfecting the construction of the Sack Mill, a universal rolling-mill on lines proposed by him as far back as the 1880s, for parallel girders with wide flanges. A description of his <b>universal</b> <b>mill</b> and of its operation is contained in a paper read by him before the Iron and Steel Institute in 1889.

40|$|AbstractUse of T-bars in {{shipbuilding}} {{has increased}} recently. Although T-bars having a web height {{of at least}} twice the flange width are generally required for ships, the dimensions of existing hot-rolled T-bars are not suitable. As a result, T-bars for ships are typically fabricated by welding two plates. To solve this problem, a new rolling method for T-bars using a <b>universal</b> <b>mill</b> and edger mill was investigated. Finite element analyses of universal and edger rolling were executed to investigate the characteristics of side camber. Next, multi-pass rolling experiments simulating the rolling passes at a universal roughing mill and an edger mill were performed, and straight pure lead T-bars having satisfactory cross sections were obtained. However, the web heights {{at the top and}} tail ends were larger than those of the other part. Additional vertical rolls were applied to edger rolling to enable a slight reduction of the web height, and the web height deflection was eliminated by this new arrangement. The results of this research clearly demonstrated the potential of the new rolling process for producing T-bars of ships...|$|E
30|$|A 6 -month {{old bovine}} fetus was {{collected}} from the local slaughter house. Metacarpal bones were dissected aseptically from the fetal calf (Holstein) and all soft tissues were removed. Radiographs were taken to determine the growth plate’s margins and limitations. With an oscillating osteotome, proximal and distal growth plates were cut and retrieved under aseptic conditions. The retrieved growth plate was then sliced. The demineralization process was performed as described by Reddi and Huggins [34]. The harvested growth plates were cleaned of soft tissue and marrow, washed in sterile distilled water with continuous stirring, then washed three times in 95  % ethanol for 15  min, rinsed in ether for 15  min, and finally air-dried overnight. The cleaned and dried growth plates were milled (<b>Universal</b> <b>Mill</b> A- 20; Tekmer Co, Cincinnati, OH, USA) to obtain 400 – 700 -μm granules and then demineralized in 0.6 -N HCl three times for 1  h (50  ml HCl per g of bone). The growth plate powder was rinsed with several changes of sterile distilled water to adjust the pH, three times in 95  % ethanol and once in ether. The growth plate powder was air-dried and stored in sterile plastic containers at 4  °C until being used for implantation. This entire process was performed under sterile conditions (except for the milling) and a sample was cultured to demonstrate that specimens contained no bacterial or fungal contamination.|$|E
