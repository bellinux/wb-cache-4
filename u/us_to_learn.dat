Like Superman eating a super hotdog while fighting King Kong while...ok {{you get the}} picture. If you were looking around for a high concept pitch-style descriptor, with its synth brass and Philly soul strings {{you might call it}} 'Stevie Wonder meets N.E.R.D in space'. But then that would be too simplistic a definition for the multifaceted, resolutely accomplished 'Sweet Thing'." [...] Pitchforks Larry Fitzmaurice labeled it a [...] "Best New Track" [...] and noted that [...] "this was a week where Frank Ocean bravely invited <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> more about his personal story; 'Sweet Life' is another reminder of how well he can structure a narrative in the musical realm." [...] The Telegraphs Neil McCormick noted that Ocean took the R genre and pushed it out into strange new places, with tracks like the [...] "blissful, jazzy jigsaw of 'Sweet Life', which seems to assemble itself from disconnected elements as it goes along." [...] AllMusic's Andy Kellman mused that the track served as one of the album's lighter moments, and wrote that [...] "the bright 'Sweet Life' and the relatively exuberant 'Monks,' both of which would be standouts on any N.E.R.D. album, offer more than bright coating, dealing in surrealism and sharp observations that are equally penetrating." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first part}} of the series {{explains}} the origins of Islamism and neoconservatism. It shows Egyptian civil servant Sayyid Qutb, depicted as the founder of modern Islamist thinking, visiting the <b>U.S.</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> about its education system, then becoming disgusted at what he judged as the corruption of morals and virtues in western society through individualism. When he returns to Egypt, he is disturbed by westernisation under Gamal Abdel Nasser and becomes convinced that in order to save his own society, it must be completely restructured along the lines of Islamic law while still using western technology. He then becomes convinced that his vision can only be accomplished through use of an elite [...] "vanguard" [...] to lead a revolution against the established order. Qutb becomes a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood and, after being tortured in one of Nasser's jails, comes to believe that western-influenced leaders can be justifiably killed to remove their corruption. Qutb is executed in 1966, but he influences Ayman al-Zawahiri, the future mentor of Osama bin Laden, to start his own secret Islamist group. Inspired by the 1979 Iranian revolution, Zawahiri and his allies assassinate Egyptian president Anwar Al-Sadat in 1981 in the hopes of starting their own revolution. However, the revolution does not materialise, and Zawahiri comes to believe that a majority of Muslims have been corrupted, not only by their western-inspired leaders, but Muslims themselves have been affected by jahilliyah and thus may be legitimate targets of violence if they refuse to join his cause. They continued to believe that a vanguard was necessary to rise up and overthrow the corrupt regime {{and replace it with a}} 'pure' Islamist state.|$|E

2500|$|The {{agreement}} also specified {{a number}} of contractual terms that, in retrospect, appear especially odd. In spite of TCA's experience with contracting for the Ministry of Transport, and Bain's personal arguments that cost-plus contracts {{be used as a}} ward against budget overruns, TCA's contract with Avro demanded fixed prices for the entire development, as well as a fixed price for the aircraft of C$350,000. Additionally, Avro was not allowed to sell the aircraft to any other airline for three years. After that period, if a buyer paid less than C$350,000 for the aircraft, Avro would have to pay the difference to TCA. Furthermore, during the testing period of one year after the first aircraft was introduced, Avro would have to pay all costs, even if paying passengers were carried. Jack Dyment, chief of TCA's entire engineering department, suggested that Avro pay for the testing so that it would [...] "permit <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how to successfully operate a jet aircraft without having to pay for such experience the hard way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Free jazz {{quickly found}} a {{foothold}} in Europe, in part because musicians such as Ayler, Taylor, Steve Lacy and Eric Dolphy spent extended periods there, and European musicians Michael Mantler, John Tchicai et al. traveled to the <b>U.S.</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> it firsthand. [...] A distinctive European contemporary jazz (often incorporating elements of free jazz {{but not limited to}} it) also flourished because of the emergence of European musicians such as Peter Brötzmann, John Surman, Zbigniew Namysłowski, Albert Mangelsdorff, Kenny Wheeler, and Mike Westbrook, who were anxious to develop new approaches reflecting their national and regional musical cultures and contexts. [...] Since the 1960s, various creative centers of jazz have developed in Europe, such as the creative jazz scene in Amsterdam. [...] Following the work of veteran drummer Han Bennink and pianist Misha Mengelberg, musicians started to explore free music by collectively improvising until a certain form (melody, rhythm, or even famous song) is found by the band. [...] Jazz critic Kevin Whitehead documented the free jazz scene in Amsterdam and some of its main exponents such as the ICP (Instant Composers Pool) orchestra in his book New Dutch Swing. [...] Since the 1990s Keith Jarrett has been prominent in defending free jazz from criticism by traditionalists.|$|E
2500|$|German {{critics were}} positive. Julia Evers of Oberösterreichische Nachrichten called the film [...] "an oppressive and {{impressive}} moral painting, in which neither the audience nor {{the people in}} the village find an escape valve from the web of authority, hierarchy and violence. [...] Everything in The White Ribbon is true. And that is why it is so difficult to bear." [...] Markus Keuschnigg of Die Presse praised the [...] "sober cinematography" [...] along with the pacing of the narrative. Challenging accusations of Haneke's cinematic approach being cold and cynical, Keuschnigg instead hailed the director as uncompromising and sincerely humanistic. Die Welts Peter Zander compared the film to Haneke's previous works Benny's Video and Funny Games, concluding that while the violence in the previous films had seemed distant and constructed, The White Ribbon demonstrates how it is a part of human society. Zander also applauded the [...] "perfectly cast children", whom he held as [...] "the real stars of this film". In Der Spiegel, Christian Buß opined that the work is [...] "a horror drama, free from horror images", and praised its deviations from conventions of contemporary German cinema, writing that [...] "Haneke forces <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how to see again".|$|E

2500|$|Between {{leaving the}} Moments and joining The Small Faces, Steve Marriott joined The Checkpoints. Chris Clements: [...] "He {{actually}} approached us (The Checkpoints) {{and said he}} needed to fulfill some gigs that were pending. This was in 1965, he was {{with us for a}} couple of months. We rehearsed at The Kentish Drovers in the Old Kent Road in South London. He got <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> James Brown numbers, which at the time we weren't very up in. One particular memory sticks in my mind. When we rehearsed with him, he almost spoke the words of the song, rather than sang the words. He was listening to us, making sure we got the backing right, so he didn't put himself out vocally. But when we did the first gig with him, out came this fantastic soul voice, we all looked at each other, and our mouths fell open! When doing the gigs, we would pick him up outside the Brewery in Romford road Essex. He always had a small case with his harmonicas in. His harmonica playing was excellent. Our transport at that time was a converted ambulance, and Steve would always sit up front with the owner driver, (a man in his early 50s) rather than sit in the back talking to us. He {{seemed to me to be}} a bit of a loner. Even when I had a conversation with him, he always seemed to be looking past me, as though in a hurry to be somewhere else. He was quite a heavy smoker as I recall. We did various venues in Essex, around the Basildon area. He had no guitar, he would use our lead guitarist's red Fender Strat. Steve would put many guitar breaks in the James Brown songs. So we would all huddle around our drummer Gary Hyde who would watch Steve. When Gary stopped, we stopped, when Gary started, we started, so by using those tactics the gigs went well. We had photos taken at the various venues at that time, I wish someone would dig them out from wherever, I would love to see them." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} {{a version of}} the zero-shot learning problem where seen class source and target domain data are provided. The goal during test-time is to accurately predict the class label of an unseen target domain instance based on revealed source domain side information (attributes) for unseen classes. Our method is based on viewing each source or target data as a mixture of seen class proportions and we postulate that the mixture patterns have to be similar if the two instances belong to the same unseen class. This perspective leads <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> source/target embedding functions that map an arbitrary source/target domain data into a same semantic space where similarity can be readily measured. We develop a max-margin framework <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> these similarity functions and jointly optimize parameters by means of cross validation. Our test results are compelling, leading to significant improvement in terms of accuracy on most benchmark datasets for zero-shot recognition. Comment: accepted for ICCV 201...|$|R
