40|$|AbstractObjective: Computed tomographic {{angiography}} (CTA) {{is currently}} {{the most commonly used}} technique for postoperative surveillance to detect endoleaks after endovascular stent graft repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms. We have evaluated the efficacy of duplex <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan</b> with the addition of an <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan</b> contrast agent in documenting endoleaks and compared these results with CTA. Methods: Conventional duplex <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan</b> with color Doppler imaging (CDI) was first done as part of routine postoperative surveillance. After the CDI study, a 1 -mL bolus of <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan</b> contrast was given via an antecubital vein, followed by a 5 -mL flush with normal saline solution. The duplex <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan</b> evaluation of the stent graft was repeated once the contrast agent was circulating throughout the blood pool, with tissue harmonic imaging to optimize visualization of the contrast agent. Status of the stent graft, {{the presence or absence of}} any endoleak, and whether these endoleaks were graft related (group I) or arterial branch related (group II) were recorded. Findings were compared with CTA studies done within a 2 -week period of the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan</b> examination. Results: Twenty patients were evaluated, 18 with modular stent grafts and two with unibody bifurcated stent grafts. Patients had a mean age of 74. 5 ± 7. 6 years; 19 were male, with only one female. All stent grafts remained widely patent with normal aortoiliac flow hemodynamics. Duplex <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan</b> with contrast identified all eight of the endoleaks seen with CTA and was able to determine whether they were group I or group II leaks. In two patients, <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan</b> with contrast detected small endoleaks at the proximal graft attachment site, with extravasation of contrast into the aneurysm sac during systole. These endoleaks were not seen with CTA but were confirmed with conventional angiography at the time of endovascular closure. Standard duplex <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan</b> with CDI failed to identify four of the 10 endoleaks in patients with technically difficult conditions. Conclusion: Duplex <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan,</b> when used with an intravenously administered <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan</b> contrast agent in the noninvasive follow-up of patients with aortic stent grafts, appears to provide good sensitivity to the presence and type of endoleaks, even in patients with technically difficult conditions not amenable to conventional duplex <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan</b> with CDI.

30|$|Introduction: In women {{presenting}} with postmenopausal bleeding, it is {{of common}} practice to use <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan</b> measurement of endometrial thickness {{as one of the}} criteria to assess whether diagnostic hysteroscopy is necessary. It is also not uncommon to offer <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan</b> assessment as part of the one stop outpatient hysteroscopy clinic in hospitals in the UK. This audit aims to assess if there is any correlation between findings from <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan</b> and hysteroscopy.|$|R
30|$|<b>Ultrasound</b> <b>scans</b> at 32 and 35  weeks {{revealed}} re-accumulation of the cyst {{to measure}} 15  cm. No further aspiration was performed, as {{the patient was}} asymptomatic. At 40  weeks the patient went into spontaneous labour and had a normal vaginal delivery. <b>Ultrasound</b> <b>scan</b> 6  weeks following the delivery showed persistence of the cyst. This was treated with re-aspiration and microbiology showed no growth on culture. One year later, the patient had her third pregnancy and antenatal and post-natal <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scans</b> confirmed complete disappearance of the cyst.|$|R
25|$|<b>Ultrasound</b> <b>scanning</b> {{constitutes}} a major leap forward in {{providing for the}} care of mother and baby, and with scanners becoming portable, these advantages have spread to rural populations. However, ultrasound scans often reveal the sex of the baby, allowing pregnant women to decide to abort female foetuses and try again later for a male child. This practice is usually considered the main reason for the change in the ratio of male to female children being born.|$|E
25|$|The {{safety of}} {{frequent}} <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scanning</b> has not be confirmed. Despite this, {{increasing numbers of}} women are choosing to have additional scans for no medical purpose, such as gender scans, 3D and 4D scans. A normal gestation would reveal a gestational sac, yolk sac, and fetal pole. The gestational age can be assessed by evaluating the mean gestational sac diameter (MGD) before week 6, and the crown-rump length after week 6. Multiple gestation is evaluated {{by the number of}} placentae and amniotic sacs present.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{unless the}} {{placenta}} {{can be easily}} tied off or removed, it may be preferable to leave it in place and allow for a natural regression. This process may take several months and can be monitored by clinical examination, checking human chorionic gonadotropin levels and by <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scanning</b> (in particular using doppler ultrasonography. Use of methotrexate to accelerate placental regression is controversial as {{the large amount of}} necrotic tissue is a potential site for infection, mifepristone has also be used to promote placental regression. Placental vessels have also been blocked by angiographic embolization. Complications of leaving the placenta can include residual bleeding, infection, bowel obstruction, pre-eclampsia (which may all necessitate further surgery) and failure to breast feed due to placental hormones.|$|E

25|$|TSC {{occurs in}} all races and ethnic groups, {{and in both}} genders. The live-birth {{prevalence}} {{is estimated to be}} between 10 and 16 cases per 100,000. A 1998 study estimated total population prevalence between about 7 and 12 cases per 100,000, with more than half of these cases undetected. These estimates are significantly higher than those produced by older studies, when TSC was regarded as an extremely rare disease. This is due to the invention of CT and <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scanning</b> having enabled the diagnosis of many nonsymptomatic cases. Prior to this, the diagnosis of TSC was largely restricted to severely affected individuals with Vogt's triad of learning disability, seizures, and facial angiofibroma. The total population prevalence estimates have steadily increased from 1:150,000 in 1956, to 1:100,000 in 1968, to 1:70,000 in 1971, to 1:34,200 in 1984, to the present figure of 1:12,500 in 1998. Whilst still regarded as a rare disease, TSC is common when compared to many other genetic diseases.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that people have been {{performing}} brachial plexus blocks for over a hundred years, there is as yet no clear evidence to support the assertion that one method of nerve localization is better than another. There are however numerous case reports documenting cases in which use of a portable <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scanning</b> device has detected abnormal anatomy that would otherwise not have been evident using a [...] "blind" [...] approach.

2500|$|Brachial plexus {{block is}} {{typically}} performed by an anesthesiologist. To achieve an optimal block, {{the tip of}} the needle should be close to the nerves of the plexus during the injection of local anesthetic solution. Commonly employed techniques for obtaining such a needle position include transarterial, elicitation of a paresthesia, and use of a peripheral nerve stimulator or a portable <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scanning</b> device. If the needle is close to or contacts a nerve, the subject may experience a paresthesia (a sudden tingling sensation, often described as feeling like [...] "pins and needles" [...] or like an electric shock) in the arm, hand, or fingers. Injection close to the point of elicitation of such a paresthesia may result in a good block. A peripheral nerve stimulator connected to an appropriate needle allows emission of electric current from the needle tip. When the needle tip is close to or contacts a motor nerve, characteristic contraction of the innervated muscle may be elicited. Modern portable ultrasound devices allow the user to visualize internal anatomy, including the nerves to be blocked, neighboring anatomic structures and the needle as it approaches the nerves. Observation of local anesthetic surrounding the nerves during ultrasound-guided injection is predictive of a successful block.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{assess the}} {{abilities}} of doctors to interpret neonatal cranial <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scans.</b>  DESIGN AND SETTING—High resolution scanned images of six important neonatal cranial ultrasound abnormalities were posted as a questionnaire to the 59 neonatal units in the North and South Thames regions.  RESULTS—Forty two questionnaires were returned (71 %). Currently 56 % of those interpreting cranial <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scans</b> are neonatal registrars, 27 % are consultant paediatricians or neonatologists, and 17 % are radiologists. The response rate from registrars was excellent (97 %), but it was poor from consultant paediatric (38 %) and radiological (40 %) staff. The mean accurate identification of cerebral abnormalities was only 59 % (range 45 - 71 %). Only 44 % of the neonatal registrars, compared with nearly all the consultant staff, have had any formal training in cranial ultrasonography.  CONCLUSIONS—The data highlight the current accuracy of neonatal cranial <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan</b> reporting in the Greater London region and {{have important implications for}} clinical services and research studies. Doctors who are responsible for interpreting neonatal cranial <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scans</b> should have formal training and supervision, and more formal reporting would improve and maintain standards.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the accuracy of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) for categorizing the severity of carotid disease relative to duplex <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan</b> and cerebral contrast arteriography (CA) to determine if MRA imaging could replace the need for cerebral angiography in cases of indeterminate or inadequate duplex scan imaging. Methods: Seventy-four carotid bifurcations in 40 patients undergoing 45 carotid endarterectomies from 1996 to 1998 were imaged with duplex ultrasound scan; MRA (two-dimensional neck and three-dimensional intracranial, time-of-flight technique); and biplanar, digital subtraction cerebral arteriography. Studies were blindly reviewed by one reader who used established threshold velocity criteria for the duplex scan and the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial method for MRA and CA to determine the percentage of diameter reduction of the internal carotid artery (ICA). Disease severity was grouped into four categories (50 % ICA stenosis were 100 %, 96 %, 98 %, and 100 % for MRA and 100 %, 72 %, 88 %, and 100 % for duplex <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan,</b> respectively; similarly, for detection of > 75 % ICA stenosis values were 100 %, 77 %, 76 %, and 100 % for MRA and 90 %, 74 %, 72 %, and 91 % for duplex <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan,</b> respectively. Both MRA and duplex <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan</b> accurately differentiated all cases of > 95 % stenosis (n = 7) from occlusion (n = 4). Short length ICA flow gaps were present on MRA in all cases of 75 % to 99 % stenosis and one half of cases of CA-defined 50 % to 74 % stenosis. In patients with 50 % to 74 % stenosis, the mean angiographic stenosis was significantly greater when a flow gap was present on MRA (64 % ± 6 %) versus no flow gap (57 % ± 7 %) (P =. 04). There was overall agreement among duplex <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan,</b> MRA, and CA in 73 % of carotids imaged. Of the 24 % discordant results between MRA and duplex <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan,</b> MRA correctly predicted disease severity in all cases, and inaccurate duplex <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan</b> results were due to overestimation in 83 % of cases. The operative plan was altered by CA findings in only one patient (2 %) after duplex <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan</b> and MRA. Conclusions: MRA can accurately categorize the severity of carotid occlusive disease. Duplex <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan</b> facilitates patient selection for carotid endarterectomy in most cases, but adjunct use of MRA improves diagnostic accuracy for > 75 % stenoses and may obviate the need for cerebral arteriography when duplex scan results are inconclusive or demonstrate borderline disease severity.

The objective of this study was to determine the perception and acceptability of menstrual dating (EDD derived from LMP) with regard to timing of labor induction for postdatism by pregnant women who have a late pregnancy (≥ 23 weeks’ gestation) <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan.</b> Methods: This cross-sectional study included 443 consecutive pregnant women receiving antenatal care at two tertiary health institutions in Enugu, Nigeria, from January 1, 2013 to March 31, 2013.

Most <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scans</b> (90. 8 %, 357 / 389) were carried out in late pregnancy, and 41. 9 % (167 / 389) were self-referred. The majority of the respondents (51. 7 %, 229 / 443) did not accept induction of labor for postdatism at a certain menstrual dating-derived gestational age of 40 weeks plus 10 days if the late pregnancy <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan</b> dating was less. Predictors of this poor attitude to timing of induction of labor for postdatism included low educational level, low social class, and poor knowledge of the limitations of <b>ultrasound</b> <b>scan</b> dating in late pregnancy (P< 0. 05).
