5|$|In actuality, Boyce {{stopped in}} London {{en route to}} a safari in British East Africa. It is true that an unknown Scout helped him and refused a tip. But this Scout only helped him cross a street; he did not take him to the Scout {{headquarters}} and Boyce never met Baden-Powell. Upon Boyce's request, the unknown Scout did give him the address of the Scout headquarters, where Boyce went and picked <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> of Scouting For Boys and other printed material on Scouting. He read this while on safari and was so impressed that instead of making his return to America an around-the-world trip via San Francisco, he returned to the Scout headquarters in London. He volunteered to organize Scouting in America and was told that he could use their manual. While Boyce's original account does not mention fog, a 1928 account says there was fog. Climatologists report no fog on that day in London.|$|E
5|$|Pattle worked {{toward this}} goal for some time until, in late 1935, by chance, he picked <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> of the Johannesburg Star newspaper. The paper {{contained}} an advertisement by the Royal Air Force (RAF) which was offering five-year short service commissions for cadets throughout the British Empire. The RAF expansion schemes required a great influx of capable personnel into the organisation as rearmament {{and the need for}} fighting men heightened. Pattle decided that a career in the RAF offered better prospects than as an instructor in South Africa and applied. Early in 1936, he was invited to Britain as an applicant. He flew to London at his own expense to attend the selection processes and was offered a commission by the selection board. He immediately returned to South Africa to arrange his migration to Britain and left aboard SS Llandovery Castle on 30 April 1936.|$|E
25|$|The 1981 festival {{village was}} {{designed}} around a central rotunda with a maypole, where spontaneously, poets, buskers and ravers alike featured. Nambassa vigorously promoted handcrafts, {{not only because}} of their therapeutic qualities, but because they had {{the potential to be a}} source of revenue to lifestyle proponents looking towards self-sufficiency and economic independence. From the festival village one could attend any number of craft workshops, pick <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> of the daily Nambassa Waves newspaper, go buy fresh bread cooked in the wood-fired oven bakery constructed in a converted hay shed, go do some shopping, check out Radio Nambassaland, pick up some information from the mother centre, or just simply chill out and absorb the atmosphere.|$|E

25|$|As Ken Hill {{rummaged through}} a used bookstore, he picked <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> of Gaston Leroux's The Phantom of the Opera novel and {{eventually}} produced it {{as a stage}} musical. The show started off as a production at Morecambe Pier as the first staged musical version, but was also first staged when Hill was working as Director of Productions for the Newcastle Playhouse. This first production was produced at The Duke’s Playhouse in Lancaster on 26 July 1976, where {{it proved to be}} a hit. It was directed by John Blackmore, designed by Clare Lyth, with musical direction by Gary Yershon. It differed from the later version of Ken Hill’s musical, in having a modern musical score by Ian Armit (who also worked with Hill on his production of The Curse of the Werewolf) in addition to excerpts from the opera Faust by Charles Gounod.|$|E
500|$|On another {{occasion}} Fleming said: [...] "I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, 'James Bond' {{was much better}} than something more interesting, like 'Peregrine Carruthers'. Exotic things would happen to and around him, but {{he would be a}} neutral figure—an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department." [...] After Fleming met the ornithologist and his wife, he described them as [...] "a charming couple who are amused by the whole joke". The ornithologist was obliquely referred to in the film Die Another Day with Pierce Brosnan's Bond picking <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> of Birds of the West Indies and posing as an ornithologist.|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} Michael Piller was displeased {{with the}} depiction of the Kazon in Biller's first draft of the episode; where {{they were supposed to}} be analogous to street gangs in Los Angeles, they were instead [...] "coming across as warmed-over Klingons." [...] In addition to Jari Taylor's already extensive notes on the draft, Piller suggested Biller get in touch with actual gang members or a police officer who could better clue the writer into street gang culture for the episode. [...] Instead, Biller picked <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> of Monsta, a book by convicted murderer and former gang member [...] "Monsta" [...] Cody. [...] The book's insight into gang life and culture was a guiding light for Biller's second draft, which he worked up with Piller, endeavoring to set the Kazon apart [...] "from Romulans, Cardassians, and Klingons." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{keeping with}} Dante's desires to satirize the {{original}} film, the sequel has some meta-references and self-referential humor. These include a cameo appearance by film critic Leonard Maltin. He holds <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> {{of the original}} Gremlins home video and denounces it, {{just as he had}} in reality; however, his rant is cut short when gremlins pounce on him. Partly for this scene, one academic called Dante [...] "one of contemporary cinema's great pranksters." ...|$|E

5000|$|One {{question}} {{surrounding this}} theory {{was what the}} actual source of distraction was when {{in the presence of}} another person. In 1978, Sanders, Baron, and Moore argued that distraction could occur if [...] "subjects wanted to get social comparison information from the other person. In an experiment, they set <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>copying</b> task in three different conditions: alone, with someone else doing the same task, and with someone else doing a different task, and hypothesized that only in the case where the other person present was doing the same task would social comparison, and therefore distraction, be occurring. The researchers hypothesized people are distracting because of the pressure to engage in social comparison, and this pressure enhances social facilitation effects.|$|R

2500|$|The French Prime Minister Guy Mollet, {{outraged by}} Nasser's move, {{determined}} that Nasser {{would not get}} his way. French public opinion very much supported Mollet, and apart from the Communists, all of the criticism of his government came from the right, who very publicly doubted that a socialist like Mollet {{had the guts to}} go to war with Nasser. During an interview with publisher Henry Luce, Mollet held <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> of Nasser's book The Philosophy of the Revolution and said: [...] "This is Nasser's Mein Kampf.

Upon his return, Amirante asked Gacy {{what he had to}} discuss with them. Gacy picked <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> of the Daily Herald from Amirante's desk; he pointed to a front-page article covering the disappearance of Robert Piest and informed his lawyers: [...] "This boy is dead.

2500|$|Chamberlain's {{ideas were}} {{influential}} {{in particular to}} Alfred Rosenberg, who became the Nazi Party's in-house philosopher. In 1909, some months before his 17th birthday, he went with an aunt to visit his guardian, where several other relatives were gathered. Bored, {{he went to a}} book shelf, picked <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> of Chamberlain's The Foundations and wrote of the moment: [...] "I felt electrified; I wrote down the title and went straight to the bookshop." [...] In 1930 Rosenberg published The Myth of the Twentieth Century, a homage to and continuation of Chamberlain's work. Rosenberg had accompanied Hitler when he called upon Wagner's widow, Cosima, in October 1923 where he met her son-in-law. Hitler told the ailing Chamberlain he was working on his own book which, he intended, should do for the Third Reich what Chamberlain's book had done for the Second.|$|E
2500|$|The NDP {{campaign}} {{was designed to}} be highly visual and memorable. Each event was built around a specific visual thematic. For instance, {{in the first week of}} the campaign, Hampton attacked the Liberal energy platform saying it was [...] "full of holes" [...] and holding <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> of the platform with oversized holes punched in it. He also illustrated it [...] "had more holes than Swiss cheese" [...] by also displaying a large block of cheese. At another event, Hampton and his campaign team argued that the Liberal positions were like [...] "trying to nail Jello to the wall" [...] by literally attempting to nail Jello to a wall. Hampton also made an appearance in front of the Toronto home of millionaire Peter Munk to denounce Eves' tax breaks, claiming that they would save Munk $18,000 a year.|$|E
2500|$|Bogarde {{featured}} as {{a medical}} student in Doctor in the House (1954), a film that {{made him one of}} the most popular British stars of the 1950s. The film co-starred Kenneth More and Donald Sinden, with James Robertson Justice as their crabby mentor. The production was initiated by Betty Box, who picked <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> of the book at Crewe during a long rail journey, and saw its possibility as a film. But Box and Ralph Thomas had [...] difficulties convincing Rank executives that people would go to a film about doctors, and that Bogarde, who up to then had played character roles, had sex appeal and could play light comedy. They were allocated a modest budget, and were only allowed to use available Rank contract artists. The film was the first of the Doctor film series based on the books by Richard Gordon.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the last}} part of the tour, Rod had been {{contacted}} by American singer, songwriter and record producer Dan Hartman's office asking that Dan have a meeting with Wendy and Rod. Hartman, who produced acts [...]38 Special, James Brown, and others, had been working on a session in LA when he picked <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> of Beyond the Valley of 1984 and could not stop playing it. He felt it was [...] "ground breaking". [...] He said, [...] "I knew I wanted to meet these people and do something with them." [...] Dan came down to the Tribeca loft, met Wendy and Rod, and a month later he and Rod were working on the production of the Metal Priestess mini-LP. The band needed more product but another album was premature, partly because Capitol Records was now making overtures for the next one. Bruce at Stiff was ready to release it and that summer Metal Priestess was recorded at Dan's private studio off his schoolhouse turned home and studio in Connecticut and released early that fall. Metal Priestess saw the band move closer to heavy metal, and also included new members Chris [...] "Junior" [...] Romanelli (replacing Jean Beauvoir) and Joey Reese.|$|E
2500|$|However, some reviews viewed that {{similarity}} as positive, {{and perceived}} it more as progression and evolution than repetition. Stylus Magazine repeated similar sentiments {{as those of}} the previous reviews, but did not feel that re-using a successful formula was a burden, Cosmo Lee saying [...] "it's not Isis' fault that they sound unoriginal these days. All {{you have to do is}} pick <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> of Decibel, open it to any page, and you’ll find someone counting the group as an influence [...] The songs are still long, the rhythms are still organic, and in general Isis still sounds like Isis". Despite having said this, the review is still very positive. PopMatters repeated the views of Lee, stating Isis are [...] "a band knowing how to execute the formula to near-perfection", and Thom Jurek of Allmusic expanded upon that point further, stating [...] "this set is not a brave leap [...] but a further look up the holy mountain to a new plateau, a hike to sacred ground". Drowned in Sound reviewer Mike Diver, however, viewed the album differently; that Isis have [...] "pushed themselves on this album, striving to achieve something honestly different to what was released before it". An IGN review described it as [...] "unique and free from boundaries", and it has been labeled as [...] "Isis' masterpiece", as well as their [...] "most compelling work to date". Writing for Alternative Press, Aaron Burgess states that [...] "save for the brief distorted squalls of [...] "Garden of Light" [...] and the pummeling metallic grooves of [...] "Not In Rivers, But In Drops," [...] there's barely anything keeping Isis tethered to the rigid [...] "post-metal" [...] genre they helped inspire".|$|E
