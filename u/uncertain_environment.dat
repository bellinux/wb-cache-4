We present a technique to formally define system attributes that can change or be changed to deal with dynamic and <b>uncertain</b> <b>environments</b> (denominated weakened specifications) as a partially ordered lattice, and to automatically explore the system under different specifications, using probabilistic model checking, to find the likelihood of satisfying a requirement. The resulting probabilities form boundaries of "optimal specifications", analogous to Pareto frontiers in multi-objective optimization, informing the designer about the system's capabilities, such as resilience or robustness, when changing its attributes to deal with dynamic and <b>uncertain</b> <b>environments.</b> We illustrate the proposed technique through a domestic robotic assistant example...|$|R

The weights of vertexes may be considered as cost, time, or opponent’s payoff, which are uncertain in most cases. This paper discusses MWDSP under hybrid <b>uncertain</b> <b>environments</b> where the weights of vertexes are random fuzzy variables. First, random fuzzy theory is introduced to describe these hybrid uncertain variables. Then we propose three decision models based on three different decision criteria to solve MWDSP under hybrid <b>uncertain</b> <b>environments.</b> To solve the proposed models, we present a hybrid intelligent algorithm where random fuzzy simulation and genetic algorithm are embedded. Numerical experiments are performed in the last to show the robustness and effectiveness of the presented hybrid intelligent algorithm...|$|R

50|$|Construction projects, {{like all}} complex activities, involve many {{partners}} with different objectives, who {{are subjected to}} many risks in an <b>uncertain</b> <b>environment.</b> In practice, different project stakeholders have different understanding and perception of project risks. Each one identifies and analyzes the project risks regarding his objectives, risk attitude and special perspective to project risks without relying on a common and shared methodology. This is why in most of construction projects, discussing the project risks and making risk based decisions are of common difficulties which may also cause to disputes between project parties. Also, the project risk management is a scalable activity and should be commensurate with the size, level of available information {{and complexity of the}} project under consideration. Furthermore, this process is iterative, since in each phase of the project, new information is available and some predicted risks events occur while others will not, new unpredicted risk events may occur or may be identified, and the characteristics of those already identified may change. Thus, an iterative risk management should be carried out at all stages of the project life cycle. As consequence, the project risk management process has to be tailored for each particular case and project.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Based on the {{heuristics}} that maintaining presumptions can {{be beneficial}} in <b>uncertain</b> <b>environments,</b> we propose {{a set of}} basic axioms for learning systems to incorporate the concept of prejudice. The simplest, memoryless model of a deterministic learning rule obeying the axioms is constructed, and shown to be equivalent to the logistic map. The system’s performance is analysed in {{an environment in which}} it is subject to external randomness, weighing learning defectiveness against stability gained. The corresponding random dynamical system with inhomogeneous, additive noise is studied, and shown to exhibit the phenomena of noise induced stability and stochastic bifurcations. The overall results allow for the interpretation that prejudice in <b>uncertain</b> <b>environments</b> entails a considerable portion of stubbornness as a secondary phenomenon. 1...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, an {{integrated}} production-inventory model is presented for a supplier, manufacturer, and retailer supply chain under conditionally permissible delay in payments in <b>uncertain</b> <b>environments.</b> The supplier produces the item {{at a certain}} rate, which is a decision variable, and purchases the item to the manufacturer. The manufacturer has also purchased and produced the item in a finite rate. The manufacturer sells the product to the retailer and also gives the delay in payment to the retailer. The retailer purchases the item from the manufacture {{to sell it to}} the customers. Ideal costs of supplier, manufacturer, and retailer have been taken into account. An integrated model has been developed and solved analytically in crisp and <b>uncertain</b> <b>environments,</b> and finally, corresponding individual profits are calculated numerically and graphically.|$|R
