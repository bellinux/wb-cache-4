2500|$|Stargazers {{are about}} 50 species of fishes, {{belonging}} to the family <b>Uranoscopidae,</b> and found worldwide in shallow waters. Stargazers are venomous; they have two large poison spines situated behind the opercle and above the pectoral fins. They can also deliver electric shocks. They are ambush predators with eyes {{on top of their}} heads (thus the name). Stargazers also have a large upward-facing mouth in a large head. They bury themselves in sand with only their eyes showing, and leap upwards to ambush fish and invertebrates overhead. Some species have a worm-shaped lure growing out of the floor of the mouth, which they wiggle to attract prey's attention. Lengths range from 18 cm up to 90cm, for the giant stargazer Kathetostoma giganteum. Stargazers are a delicacy in some cultures. The venom is destroyed when it is cooked, and stargazers are sold in some fish markets with their electric organ removed. They have been called [...] "the meanest things in creation" [...] and the [...] "worst pet on earth".|$|E

50|$|Atlantic {{stargazer}} (Uranoscopus scaber) is a marine, subtropical fish {{of family}} <b>Uranoscopidae.</b> Its body is suited for {{living on the}} sea floor, {{and is one of}} few fish capable of bioelectrogenesis, or the ability to generate an electric charge.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} is a table of electric fish species listed by family. Most families inhabit fresh water. Two groups of marine fish, the electric rays (Torpediniformes: Narcinidae and Torpedinidae) and the stargazers (Perciformes: <b>Uranoscopidae),</b> are capable of generating strong electric pulses.|$|E
50|$|The {{stargazers}} are a family, <b>Uranoscopidae,</b> of perciform {{fish that}} have eyes {{on top of}} their heads (hence the name). The family includes about 51 species (one extinct) in eight genera, all marine and found worldwide in shallow and deep saltwaters.|$|E
50|$|Dollfus' {{stargazer}} (Uranoscopus dollfusi) is a fish of {{the family}} <b>Uranoscopidae,</b> widespread in the Western Indian Ocean: Gulf of Suez, Gulf of Oman, and Persian Gulf. It is a marine demersal fish, and occurs at depths down to about 46 m. It was named in honour of Dr R. P. Dollfus who led an expedition to Egypt in 1928-1929 and who brought back some specimens of this fish which he mistakenly identified as Uranoscopus affinis. These were new to science and became the type specimens of the new species U. dollfusi, with the Gulf of Suez being the type locality.|$|E

40|$|The {{anatomy of}} the family <b>Uranoscopidae</b> {{including}} osteological and mycological features is examined and described in details based on eight genera and 32 uranoscopid species. As results of anatomy and phylogenetic analysis, the monophyly of the family is reconfirmed to be strongly supported by 59 synapomorphies (plus 11 according to ACCTRAN). The phylogenetic relationships of uranoscopids were inferred from the morphological characters in 113 transformation series. Pleuroscopus and Xenocephalus, having a sister relationship, are branched off initially from remaining members, and monophyletic Kathetostoma is branched off. Kathetostoma has a sister relationship with a monophyletic group comprising Uranoscopus, Genyagnus, Ichthyscopus and Astroscopus. Selenoscopus is inferred as nesting deeply phylogenetically within Uranoscopus. In addition, a sister relationship of the <b>Uranoscopidae</b> and Trachinidae is examined to be supported by 22 synapomorphies (plus two according to ACCTRAN). The newly defined family <b>Uranoscopidae</b> comprises seven genera: Pleuroscopus, Xenocephalus, Kathetostoma, Uranoscopus, Genyagnus, Ichthyscopus and Astroscopus. The monotypic genus Selenoscopus is synonymized with Uranoscopus. The benthic life style of <b>Uranoscopidae</b> is described and discussed...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we study the {{presence}} and the composition of 24 species of bony fish, representing 18 families and 7 orders of teleosts. The species studied belonging to orders Clupeiformes and Lophiiformes display typical protamines, whereas the species belonging to orders Notacanthi-formes, Gadiformes, and Ophiidiformes contain histones instead of protamines in their sperm nuclei. In these species, one or more specific proteins {{are added to the}} pattern of canonical histones and, in the cases that have been analysed compositionally (Merluccius capensis, Cataetyx laticeps), the specific proteins seem to be related to histones. Among the order Scorpaeniformes, the species Helicolenus dactylopterus (family Scorpaenidae) presents protamines, whereas Trigla lucerna (family Triglidae) contains histones. Similarly, among the order Perciformes, the species from six families (Percichthyidae, Labridae, Trachinidae, <b>Uranoscopidae,</b> Gempylidae, and Scombridae) have protamines in sperm nuclei and species from two families (Sparidae and Trichiuridae) retain histones and increase the proportion of H 1 histone approximately twofold. Two species of Mullus (family Mullidae, order Perciformes) display special proteins with an electrophoretic behaviour corresponding to histone H 4 but an amino acid composition more basic. The results indicate that bony fishes have adopted three main alternatives to condense their nuclear sperm chromatin: namely, protamines, histones, and histone-like proteins. Moreover, these alternatives do not correspond strictly with phylogeny, favouring the hypothesis that the change “protamine → histone” (or alternatively “histone → protamine”) has occurred independently several times during the evolution of bony fishes.
