More specifically, it focuses on the efficient generation and solution of large Markov chains which are derived from models of <b>unrestricted</b> <b>timed</b> transition systems. Timed transition systems may be described using several high-level formalisms, including Generalised Stochastic Petri nets, queueing networks and Queueing Petri nets. A system modelled {{with one of these}} formalisms may be mapped onto a Markov chain through a process known as state space generation. The Markov chain thus generated can then be solved for its steady-state distribution by numerically determining the solution to a large set of sparse linear equations known as the steady-state equations. Existing techniques of state space generation are surveyed and a new space-saving probabilistic dynamic state management technique is proposed and analysed in terms of its reliability and space complexity. State space reduction techniques involving on-the-fly elimination of vanishing states are also considered. Linear equation solvers suitable for solving large sparse sets of linear equations are surveyed, including direct methods, classical iterative methods, Krylov Subspace techniques and decomposition-based techniques. Emphasis is placed on Krylov subspace techniques and the Aggregation-Isolation technique, which is a recent decomposition-based algorithm applicable to solving general Markov chains. Since Markov chains derived from real life models may have very large state spaces, it is desirable to automate the performance analysis sequence. Consequently, the new state management technique and several linear equation solvers have been implemented in the Markov chain analyser DNAmaca. DNAmaca accepts a high-level model description of a timed transition system, generates the state space, derives and solves the steady-state equations and produces performance statistics. DNAmaca is described in detail and examples of timed transition systems which have been analysed with DNAmaca are presented...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundTime is a {{measurable}} and critical resource {{that affects the}} quality of services provided in clinical practice. There is limited insight into the effects of time restrictions on clinicians’ cognitive processes with the electronic health record (EHR) in providing ambulatory care. ObjectiveTo understand the impact of time constraints on clinicians’ synthesis of text-based EHR clinical notes. MethodsWe used an established clinician cognitive framework based on a think-aloud protocol. We studied interns’ thought processes as they accomplished a set of four preformed ambulatory care clinical scenarios with and without time restrictions in a controlled setting. ResultsInterns most often synthesized details relevant to patients’ problems and treatment, {{regardless of whether or}} not the time available for task performance was restricted. In contrast to previous findings, subsequent information commonly synthesized by clinicians related most commonly to the chronology of clinical events for the <b>unrestricted</b> <b>time</b> observations and to investigative procedures for the time-restricted sessions. There was no significant difference in the mean number of omission errors and incorrect deductions when interns synthesized the EHR clinical notes with and without time restrictions (3. 5 ± 0. 5 vs. 2. 3 ± 0. 5, p= 0. 14). ConclusionOur results suggest that the incidence of errors during clinicians’ synthesis of EHR clinical notes is not increased with modest time restrictions, possibly due to effective adjustments of information processing strategies learned from the usual time-constrained nature of patient visits. Further research is required to investigate the effects of similar or more extreme time variations on cognitive processes employed with different levels of expertise, specialty, and with different care settings...|$|E

We allow the number of these additional confounding variables to be larger than the sample size, and suppose that, in addition to <b>unrestricted</b> <b>time</b> and individual specific effects, these confounding variables are generated by {{a small number of}} common factors and high-dimensional weakly-dependent disturbances. We allow that both the factors and the disturbances are related to the outcome variable and other variables of interest. To make informative inference feasible, we impose that the contribution of the part of the confounding variables not captured by time specific effects, individual specific effects, or the common factors can be captured by {{a relatively small number of}} terms whose identities are unknown. Within this framework, we provide a convenient computational algorithm based on factor extraction followed by lasso regression for inference about parameters of interest and show that the resulting procedure has good asymptotic properties. We also provide a simple k-step bootstrap procedure that may be used to construct inferential statements about parameters of interest and prove its asymptotic validity. The proposed bootstrap may be of substantive independent interest outside of the present context as the proposed bootstrap may readily be adapted to other contexts involving inference after lasso variable selection and the proof of its validity requires some new technical arguments. We also provide simulation evidence about performance of our procedure and illustrate its use in two empirical applications...|$|E

Chapter 1 examines a reevaluation of the excess volatility 				puzzle in asset prices by assessing {{the impact of}} a shift in the 				agent 2 ̆ 7 s focus from minimizing average loss to minimizing maximum 				loss. Chapters 2 and 3 extend and clarify the newly developing 				arena of economic models in which the agent 2 ̆ 7 s capacity for 				information processing is systematically limited, as in the 				recent rational inattention literature. Chapter 1, which represents joint work with Charles Whiteman, 				studies the consequences changing the present value formula for 				stock prices. In place of the squared-error-loss minimizing 				expected present value of future dividends, we use a predictor 				optimal for the min-max preference relationship appropriate in 				cases of ambiguity. With "robust 2 ̆ 2 predictions, the well-known 				variance bound is reversed in that prices are predicted to be 				far more volatile than what is observed. We also investigate an 				intermediate "partially robust 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 case in which the degree of 				ambiguity is limited, and discover that such an intermediate 				model cannot be rejected in favor of an <b>unrestricted</b> <b>time</b> series 				model. Chapter 2 demonstrates the properties and solutions for the more 				general two-period rational inattention model. We show that the 				problem is convex, can be solved in seconds, and highlights 				several important features of 				information-processing-capacity-constrained models. 				Additionally, we show the importance of deriving, rather than 				assuming, the form of the final solution in rational inattention 				models. Chapter 3 extends the work of Chapter 2 to a finite-horizon 				dynamic setting by creating a structure in which distributional 				state and control variables interact under 				information-processing constraints. Limited information 				processing capacity is used optimally, and agents have the 				opportunity to trade processing capacity for higher expected 				future income. The framework is applied to the canonical 				life-cycle model of consumption and saving, and an analysis of 				the impact of preference parameters on optimal attention 				allocation is conducted.

40|$|Life {{transitions}} such as {{birth and}} death constitute a significant area within anthropological studies of ritual. It is important to investigate how individuals, groups, and communities organize around these events. Birth and death {{can be considered as}} rites of passage that mark key life transitions (van Gennep 1909 / 1960). Thus {{birth and death}} related rituals need to be investigated within the social and cultural context of American hospital settings to better understand the social organization of life, death, and personhood. In the American hospital setting, a reproductive loss at any gestational age receives the medical diagnostic label of an intrauterine fetal death (IUFD). An IUFD is consequently both a physical and social process that is medically managed in a labor and delivery unit. There is a need to more meaningfully understand how life, death, and personhood issues are handled during this difficult event for women, their families, and the health care staff. The pregnancy loss (IUFD) process, staff caring practices, and meaning making can be anthropologically viewed as a ritualistic process. An IUFD is a unique rite of passage that is a juxtaposition of a birth and a death. Ten women and their families, and 20 health care staff participated in this yearlong ethnographic study. Qualitative ethnographic methods included engaging in participant observation and conducting in-depth and follow-up interviews. Two exemplar case studies are discussed in detail. Data was coded and analyzed. Findings suggest that women and their families experience an IUFD as a birth rather than a procedure and recognize their non-viable fetus as a person.

40|$|Immigration {{is on top}} of the European {{political}} agenda. Illegal immigration at the European boarders is {{a central}} issue. The European approach to deal with this problem so far was to close the boarders and to enhance controls. These measures did not lead to a decline of the quantity of illegal immigrants, but to a shift of routes. In recent years, European politicians recognized that determent does not change the immigration situation in Southern Europe. Hence, new approaches towards legal immigration such as temporary and selective immigration are discussed. These concepts are the basis for the following analysis. This thesis identifies {{a way to deal with}} illegal Immigration by applying temporary and selective immigration. On the basis of existing immigration theories we develop an economic model to demonstrate the functionality of temporary migration. The incentives of the migrants are essential for the parameters of the model. The incentive to leave right on time to the home country is supported by a monetary incentive. In the model legal migration is possible on a fixed-term visa, while it is not possible to migrate without this visa. In the initial situation there is only illegal immigration. The model explains the constraints for a working concept of temporary immigration. We find that the capital market conditions for immigrants are crucial. The results show that the implementation of temporary immigration is feasible if the return of the migrants is supported financially. There is a simultaneous discourse on the European level about controlling illegal migration and the implementation of temporary immigration as well as about desirable migration of qualified migrants. This work analyses both aspects in one model. To do so we combine the model of temporary migration with a selection approach. This approach generates a selection of qualified and unqualified migrants after a probation period. The selection instruments are a tax on working income and a monetary bond for leaving the country. The migrants differ in their working productivity. The analysis of both political targets of the EU, reducing illegal migration through temporary migration and increasing the immigration of qualified migrants, leads to an efficient solution for both objectives. Asymmetric information about the working productivity can be reduced through monitoring during probation period and monetary incentives. Permanent immigration of qualified migrants is feasible via the right choice of incentive instruments. The firms can employ the desired quantity of migrants for an <b>unrestricted</b> <b>time</b> and the other migrants have the incentive to go home due to the monetary bond for leaving. The work´s aim is to determine a concept to solve the situation of illegal migration; the introduced approaches can be designed to reduce risks and costs for migrants and the destination countries. Legal migration can be an instrument to combat refugee disasters. In combination with a selective approach it is possible to reduce the shortage of skilled workers in certain sectors. The conclusion for the EU is to examine these two migration issues together to find a combined solution and concept...|$|E

This success relies on time diversity, which in its turn relies on <b>unrestricted</b> buffering <b>time</b> at the receiver. In realtime streaming the playback buffering time is very limited (shorter than one second) and even strong FEC codes cannot protect single path communication against failures lasting longer than the buffering time at the receiver. Path diversity is a strategy that is orthogonal to time diversity and can make FEC applicable also in case of limited buffering time of real-time streaming.

We thus define a tolerance level r meaning that we only tolerate that the completion time of {{a parallel}} program after a crash is at most a factor r + 1 larger than if we use optimal allocation on m - 1 computers. This is an r-dependent restriction of the set of allocations of a program. Then, what is the worst-case ratio of the optimal r-dependent completion time in the case of no crash and the <b>unrestricted</b> optimal completion <b>time</b> of the same parallel program? We denote the maximal ratio of completion times f(r, m) - i. e., the ratio for worst-case programs. In the paper we establish upper and lower bounds of the worst-case cost function f(r, m) and characterize worst-case programs. Open Access Journa...|$|R
40|$|Alternating timed automata are a {{powerful}} extension of classical Alur-Dill timed automata that are closed under all Boolean operations. They {{have played a}} key role, among others, in providing verification algorithms for prominent specification formalisms such as Metric Temporal Logic. Unfortunately, when interpreted over an infinite dense time domain (such as the reals), alternating timed automata have an undecidable language emptiness problem. In this thesis we consider restrictions on this model that restore the decidability of the language emptiness problem. We consider the restricted class of safety alternating timed automata, which can encode a corresponding Safety fragment of Metric Temporal Logic. This thesis connects these two formalisms with insertion channel machines, a model of faulty communication, and demonstrates that the three formalisms are interreducible. We thus prove a non-elementary lower bound for the language emptiness problem for 1 -clock safety alternating timed automata and further obtain a new proof of decidability for this problem. Complementing the restriction to safety properties, we consider interpreting the automata over bounded dense time domains. We prove that the time-bounded language emptiness problem is decidable but non-elementary for <b>unrestricted</b> alternating <b>timed</b> automata. The language emptiness problem for alternating timed automata is a special case of a much more general and abstract logical problem: Church's synthesis problem. Given a logical specification S(I,O), Church's problem is {{to determine whether there}} exists an operator F that implements the specification in the sense that S(I,F(I)) holds for all inputs I. It is a classical result that the synthesis problem is decidable in the case that the specification and implementation are given in monadic second-order logic over the naturals. We prove that this decidability extends to MSO over the reals with order and furthermore to MSO over every fixed bounded interval of the reals with order and the + 1 relation.
