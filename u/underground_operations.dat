The C Stock trains used on the Circle line, Hammersmith & City line and sections of the District line and the D Stock used on {{the remainder of the}} District line were also ageing, and no plans were in place for their replacement. Following lengthy and expensive negotiations, an order was placed in 2003 with Bombardier Transportation for a fleet of new trains to take over all operations on the Metropolitan, Hammersmith & City and District lines.|$|E

25|$|Germany did not {{undergo the}} {{extensive}} tramway closure programmes that {{were carried out}} in other European countries and many cities retain their original tram networks. In some places, tram networks have been added or expanded through the introduction of hybrid tram-train or stadtbahn systems which may combine standard railway, on-street and <b>underground</b> <b>operations.</b> Notable examples include the systems in Cologne and Karlsruhe. In Frankfurt-am-Main, many tram lines were transferred to U-Bahn operation.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the copper}} was {{for sale to}} India as it was taking {{over a third of}} world copper supply in the mid-19th century. Due to the lack of {{smelting}} in South Australia, copper ore was initially shipped to Cornwall. The company purchased a Cornish beam engine which was the first in Australia when erected in 1848. Due to the uneconomic state of the mine, in 1868 a decision made to open cut the mine. Mining ceased underground, having reached a depth of 183metres(600ft) and open-cut operations starting in 1870 although, over the remaining life of the mine, small <b>underground</b> <b>operations</b> extracted more ore than the expensive open cut.|$|E
25|$|A {{few yards}} away from the Ordnance Survey's {{triangulation}} point on the Graig stands Lisvane's only Cold War nuclear bunker. During World War II the Royal Observer Corps (ROC) observation post stood on the Graig with its clear views over the village {{and the city of}} Cardiff. The volunteer ROC observers spotted many German Luftwaffe raids approaching across the channel and activated the air raid warnings in the Cardiff area. In early 1966 a protected nuclear fallout shelter (or bunker) was completed on the site for the ROC (OS Grid Ref: ST 1898 8508), who by the 1960s had switched from above ground aircraft spotting to <b>underground</b> <b>operations</b> with instruments to detect nuclear explosions and warn the public of approaching radioactive fallout in the event of nuclear war.|$|E
500|$|On the First Army front German sappers also {{conducted}} <b>underground</b> <b>operations,</b> seeking out Allied tunnels to assault and counter-mine, in which 41 New Zealand tunnellers {{were killed and}} 151 wounded. The British tunnellers had gained an advantage over the German miners by the Autumn of 1916, which virtually ended the German underground threat. The British turned to digging 12 subways about [...] down, to the front line, the longest tunnel being [...] long of the [...] dug. In one sector, four Tunnelling companies of 500 men each, worked around-the-clock in 18-hour shifts for two months to dig [...] of subways for foot traffic, tramways with rails for hand-drawn trolleys and a light railway system. Most tunnels were lit by electricity, accommodated telephone cables and some had trams and water supplies. Caverns were dug into the sides for brigade and battalion HQs, first aid posts and store-rooms. The subways {{were found to be}} a most efficient way to relieve troops in the line, form up for the attack and then to evacuate wounded. Some of the tunnels were continued into Russian saps with exits in mine craters in no man's land and new mines were laid. Galleries were dug to be opened after the attack for communication or cable trenches, the work being done by the 172nd, 176th, 182nd and 185th Tunnelling companies (Lieutenant-Colonel G. C. Williams, Controller of Mines First Army).|$|E

2500|$|In {{the front}} sector {{allocated}} to XV Corps between Fricourt and Mametz, the Mametz West {{group of four}} [...] mines was planted along the German trench lines running east from the heights of Bois Français, located south of Hidden Wood and [...] south-east of Fricourt. The unit in charge was the 174th Tunnelling Company. Underground fighting at Bois Français had already {{taken place in the}} winter of 1914 and spring of 1915. [...] Before the summer of 1916, no-man's land south of Bois Français had already witnessed the blowing of at least eight mines, and [...] the area of Kiel and Danube trenches, located some [...] to the east of Bois Français, had also seen extensive <b>underground</b> <b>operations.</b> In October 1915, John Norton-Griffiths had even advocated the use of poison gas to deal with the German resistance in the [...] Bois Français sector, but the proposal was not followed up. As at Fricourt, no frontal assault was planned in this area for 1 July as the British infantry would have had to advance across large crater fields. Instead, the Royal Engineers placed the Mametz West mine group there – three charges at Kiel Trench and one at Danube Trench. The first purpose of these mines was to protect the left of the 7th Division's attack south of Mametz, while the second was to protect the 20th Battalion, Manchester Regiment during their attack on the German lines.|$|E
2500|$|The tunnellers {{named the}} {{individual}} quarries after their home towns (Auckland, Wellington, Nelson, Blenheim, Christchurch, Russell and Dunedin for the New Zealanders, and Glasgow, Edinburgh, Crewe and London for the Britons). Assault tunnels were also dug, stopping a few metres {{short of the}} German line, ready to be blown open by explosives {{on the first day}} of the battle. On 4 January 1917, the unit started putting in electricity in the Ronville quarries. Two weeks later, most of the work on the connection tunnels in the Ronville underground system was complete. On 24 January, the New Zealand Tunnelling Company began installing direction signs in the underground system. The next day, they started early works to organise a tramway line into the Ronville and Saint-Sauveur systems. By that time, the tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers had constructed 20kilometres of tunnels, graded as subways (foot traffic only), tramways (with rails for hand-drawn trolleys, for taking ammunition to the line and bringing casualties back from it) and railways (a light railway system). The tunnel system could accommodate 24,000 men and was equipped with running water, electric light, kitchens, latrines, a small power station and a medical centre with a fully equipped operating theatre. In addition to this, conventional mines were laid under the front lines, ready to be blown immediately before the assault. In the meantime, German sappers were actively conducting their own <b>underground</b> <b>operations,</b> seeking out Allied tunnels to assault and counter-mine. On 14–16 March 1917, the German withdrawal on the Hindenburg Line (Siegfried Stellung) made it impossible to attack from the Ronville system. Despite this setback, electricity was installed and tested in the whole system beneath Arras by 3 April 1917, ready for the start of the Battle of Arras on 9 April. On the first day of the battle, the New Zealand Tunnelling Company opened three tunnels located at the end of Saint-Sauveur system, allowing infantrymen to appear suddenly in the German trenches. Owing to the German withdrawal from their front line south-east of Arras, the unit also fired the only mine that was used on the Arras front on 9 April. It was located to the north-east at Blagny, and was a [...] charge, blown by the New Zealand Tunnelling Company at zero, 5.30 a.m. It destroyed two German dugouts, [...] of trench and a concrete pillbox. However, it also stunned and apparently buried some members of the 13th Royal Scots and impeded their assault temporarily.|$|E
