The rfb (O-antigen biosynthesis) gene cluster directs the synthesis of D-galactan I and consists of six genes termed rfbA-FKPO 1. In this paper we show that rfbDKPO 1 encodes a UDP-galactopyranose mutase (NAD(P) H-requiring) (EC 5. 4. 99. 9), which forms <b>uridine</b> 5 '-(trihydrogen <b>diphosphate)</b> P'-alpha-D-galactofuranosyl ester (UDP-Galf), the biosynthetic precursor of galactofuranosyl residues. The deduced amino acid sequence of rfbDKPO 1 shows 85 % and 37. 5 % identity to the rfbDKPO 8 gene of K. pneumoniae serotype O 8 and the glf gene of Escherichia coli, respectively. The molecular mass of the purified RfbDKPO 1 enzyme is 45 kDa as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, while gel filtration revealed a molecular mass of 92 kDa, suggesting a dimeric structure for the native protein.

40|$|Abstract 1. 1. After {{illumination}} {{of leaves}} {{in the presence of}} 14 CO 2 for various times and subsequent freeze drying, chloroplasts were isolated using a nonaqueous procedure. The time-course of the distribution of a number of compounds between chloroplasts and the remainder of the cell was calculated from the 14 C-incorporation into the fractions obtained. 2. 2. Labelled ribulose diphosphate, sedoheptulose diphosphate and sedoheptulose monophosphate occurred, at least during the first minutes of photosynthesis, solely in the chloroplasts. At the beginning of photosynthesis phosphoglyceric acid, fructose diphosphate, fructose monophosphate and glucose monophosphate appeared first in the chloroplasts, but were found later also in the non-chloroplastic part of the cell. The major part of glucose <b>diphosphate,</b> <b>uridine</b> diphosphoglucose, sucrose, malic acid and citric acid was always located in the non-chloroplastic part of the cell. 3. 3. From the results it is concluded that the photosynthetic carbon cycle operates exclusively in the chloroplasts. Sugar phosphates, which are not needed in the cyclic regeneration of the CO 2 -acceptor, are directly translocated into the cytoplasm. The synthesis of uridine diphosphoglucose takes place mainly in the cytoplasm. Glucose diphosphate and possibly also sucrose seem to be formed in the cytoplasm of the leaf cell...|$|R
40|$|The microviscosity and {{fluidity}} of erythrocyte ghost membranes from lead {{workers and}} control subjects {{was measured by}} fluorescence polarisation using the fluorophore, 1, 6 -diphenyl- 1, 3, 5 -hexatriene (DPH). Increased lead {{was associated with a}} significant decrease in the average microviscosity of resealed and unsealed erythrocyte membranes. Since DPH fluorescence reflects the organisation of lipids in the central core of the membrane, two aspects of phospholipid metabolism were investigated. Phospholipids were extracted from red blood cell ghost membranes and identified by high performance liquid chromatography. The ratio of phosphatidyl choline to phosphatidyl ethanolamine, an established correlate of membrane fluidity, was significantly increased in lead workers. This is attributed to the known increases in red blood cell cholesterol in lead workers and the structural incompatibility of phosphatidyl ethanolamine and cholesterol, which result in a compensatory increase of phosphatidyl choline. Erythrocyte ghost membranes from control subjects were resealed with the intermediates in phospholipid synthesis that increase with a lead inhibited decrease in red blood cell pyrimidine 5 '-nucleotidase. Membrane fluidity was not modified by incubation with cytidine triphosphate, <b>uridine</b> triphosphate, cytidine <b>diphosphate</b> choline, or cytidine diphosphate ethanolamine.
