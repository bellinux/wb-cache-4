5|$|Haywood was an {{advocate}} of industrial unionism, a labor philosophy that favors organizing all workers in an industry under one union, regardless of the specific trade or skill level; this was {{in contrast to the}} craft <b>unions</b> <b>that</b> were prevalent at the time, such as the AFL. His belief that workers of all ethnicities should be united also clashed with many unions. His preference for direct action over political tactics alienated him from the Socialist Party leadership and contributed to his recall from the party's executive committee in 1913.|$|E

5|$|The strike {{heightened}} public fear {{of labor}} unrest {{and the possible}} radicalism that lay behind it. It contributed to the public anxiety of the period known as the Red Scare of 1919–1920. The failure of this and other strikes {{in the years following}} World War I contributed to declining union membership in subsequent years. The American Federation of Labor responded to political pressure experienced during the strike and revoked the charters it had granted to police <b>unions.</b> <b>That</b> ended police unionism in the U.S. for two decades, as police would not try to organize until World War II.|$|E

5|$|During the 1990s {{and early}} 2000s, several city councils and {{autonomous}} communities had opened registers for civil <b>unions</b> <b>that</b> allowed benefits for unmarried couples of any sex, although {{the effect was}} mainly symbolic. Registries were created in 16 out of 17 of Spain's autonomous communities; Catalonia (1998), Aragon (1999), Navarre (2000), Castile-La Mancha (2000), Valencia (2001), Balearic Islands (2001), Madrid (2001), Asturias (2002), Andalusia (2002), Castile and León (2002), Extremadura (2003), Basque Country (2003), Canary Islands (2003), Cantabria (2005), Galicia (2008) and La Rioja (2010), and in both autonomous cities; Ceuta (1998) and Melilla (2008) Spanish law already allowed single people to adopt children; thus, a same-sex couple could undertake a de facto adoption, but the partner who was not the legal parent had no rights if the relationship ended or the legal parent died. Same-sex marriages were not legal in the autonomous communities, because the Spanish Constitution gives the State sole power to legislate marriage.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, {{both parties}} made similar {{proposals}} to reduce authoritarianism {{and the political}} influence of the military, and to maintain the Argentine claim in the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute.

The last rally was at the Plaza de la República, and was attended by 400,000 people.|$|E
5|$|The {{revolution}} in 1944 left {{many of the}} biggest opponents of organized labor unaffected, such as the landed elite and the United Fruit Company. The revolution, and election of Arévalo, nonetheless marked a significant shift in the fortunes of labor unions. The protests of 1944 strengthened the labor movement {{to the point where}} Ponce Vaides stopped enforcing the repressive vagrancy law, which was abolished in the 1945 constitution. On 1 May 1945, Arévalo made a speech celebrating organized labor, to a tremendously positive reception. The freedom of press guaranteed in the new constitution also drew much attention to the brutal working conditions in Guatemala City. From the beginning, the new <b>unions</b> <b>that</b> were formed fell into two camps, those that were communist and those that were not. The repressive policies of the Ubico government had driven both factions underground, but they re-emerged after the revolution.|$|E
