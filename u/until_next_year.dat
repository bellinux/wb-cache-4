25|$|In Manitou Springs, Colorado, Epiphany {{is marked}} by the Great Fruitcake Toss. Fruitcakes are thrown, {{participants}} dress as kings, fools, etc., and competitions are held for the farthest throw, the most creative projectile device, etc. As with customs in other countries, the fruitcake toss {{is a sort of}} festive symbolic leave-taking of the Christmas holidays <b>until</b> <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> but with humorous twist, since fruitcake (although the traditional Christmas bread of America, England and other English speaking nations) is considered in the United States with a certain degree of derision, and is the source of many jokes.|$|E
25|$|Bulgaria, {{which also}} {{suffered}} heavy losses and great material damage during Nicephorus' campaign, {{also had to}} reorganize its army and resources and {{was not able to}} advance <b>until</b> <b>next</b> <b>year.</b> The Bulgarian attacks were concentrated mainly in Thrace but also along the valley of Strymōn (Struma) river. Many towns were seized and their population was sent far to the north in Bulgaria across the Danube. The attack created such panic among the Byzantine population that several towns were emptied even without being attacked by the Bulgarians. The attempts of Michael I to resist were fruitless – he organized an army but soon after he set off from Constantinople he had to go back due to a conspiracy.|$|E

500|$|Metroid Dread first {{appeared}} in an official internal software list made by Nintendo in 2005 which listed [...] "key DS games set to be announced in the future." [...] This led to the expectation that it would appear at the Electronic Entertainment Expo convention in both 2005 and 2006. It {{was to be a}} 2D side-scrolling video game and a sequel to the 2002 video game Metroid Fusion. IGN editor Craig Harris noted that Nintendo revealed it too early and that people should wait <b>until</b> <b>next</b> <b>year.</b> Rumors suggested that Metroid Dread was cancelled or placed in development hell.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by mostly American staff from the Sega Technical Institute, while the Japanese side of the studio were producing Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Sonic & Knuckles (then conceptualized as a single game). Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was credited with boosting sales of the Sega Genesis in the 1992 holiday season. Sega of America's management realized that the next Sonic the Hedgehog title would not be ready <b>until</b> <b>next</b> <b>year</b> and thus decided to commission another game that could be completed quickly {{in time for a}} release during the 1993 holiday season. Sega's research team suggested that the [...] "Casino Night Zone" [...] of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was among the most popular levels in the game. This provided Peter Morawiec, the game's designer, with a general direction of the upcoming game. With an idea established, the developers envisioned a way of extracting the enjoyable aspects of this single level and expanding on them broadly enough to form a concept around which an entire game could be based. Morawiec drew inspiration from Pinball Dreams, a game released for the Amiga in 1992, to combine pinball mechanics with the gameplay of Sonic the Hedgehog. Collaborating with three colleagues, Morawiec designed basic animations depicting Sonic as a pinball. The animations were demonstrated to Sega's senior management, who approved the project.|$|E
500|$|The UK's Daily Telegraph {{also gave}} the film a {{positive}} review, remarking, [...] "For {{the most part}} the action romps along, spurred by some impressive special effects," [...] adding, [...] "It's just slightly disappointing that, with the momentum having been established so effectively, we now have to wait <b>until</b> <b>next</b> <b>year</b> to enjoy the rest of the ride." [...] Roger Ebert awarded the first part three out of four stars, praising the cast and calling it [...] "a handsome and sometimes harrowing film [...] [...] [...] completely unintelligible for anyone coming to the series for the first time". Scott Bowles of USA Today called it, [...] "Menacing and meditative, Hallows is arguably the best instalment of the planned eight-film franchise, though audiences who haven't kept up with previous chapters will be hopelessly lost", while Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly likewise praised the film as [...] "the most cinematically rewarding chapter yet." [...] In a review for the Orlando Sentinel, Roger Moore proclaimed Part I as [...] "Alternately funny and touching, it's the best film in the series, an Empire Strikes Back for these wizards and their wizarding world. And those effects? They're so special you don't notice them." [...] Ramin Setoodeh of Newsweek gave a negative review, writing, [...] "They've taken one of the most enchanting series in contemporary fiction and sucked out all the magic [...] [...] [...] while Rowling's stories are endlessly inventive, Potter onscreen just gives you a headache." [...] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post found the film to be [...] "Beautifully shot but a soulless cash machine... delivers no dramatic payoff, no resolution and not much fun." ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 2016, {{during the}} week leading up to Record Store Day, for which the band was its {{ambassador}} for 2016, Ulrich told Billboard that the band's expanded role within the music industry had {{played a part in}} {{the amount of time that}} it had taken to write and record the album. [...] "The way we do things now is very different than the way we did things back in the days of Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning. Nowadays we like to do so many different things." [...] Ulrich was also optimistic that production of the album had almost reached its completion. [...] "Unless something radical happens it would be difficult for me to believe that it won't come out in 2016". In May 2016, Ulrich said in an interview with Metal Forces that the album would be released in the summer of 2016, and that details for the new album would be finalized in the next month. [...] "If the record doesn't come out this year then it won't be because it’s not done... it will be because there's some sort of cosmic reason that it would be smarter to hold onto it <b>until</b> <b>next</b> <b>year.</b> But the record will be done this summer". Recording of the album was completed in June 2016 once the recording for the song [...] "Hardwired" [...] was finished.|$|E

60|$|For {{the rest}} of the afternoon, and indeed far into the night, our {{conversation}} consisted almost entirely of conjectures regarding the probable condition of things at the house.

Dave put Dusky Burns in charge of the Mammon Creek claim, and himself lingered on in Dawson. Little use. She wanted her freedom a while longer; she must have it, and she would not marry <b>until</b> <b>next</b> <b>year.</b> And so, on the first ice, Dave Walsh went alone down the Yukon behind his dogs, with the understanding that the marriage would take place when he arrived on the first steamboat of the next year.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am no' swayed. Ye ken {{this was}} ever my own view. I feel, in my heart, that what Mr. Wilding says is right. It is but what I said myself, and Captain Matthews with me, before we {{embarked}} upon this expedition. We {{were in danger}} of ruining all by a needless precipitancy. Nay, man, never stare so," [...] he said to Grey, [...] "I am in it now and I am no' the man to draw back, nor do I go so far as Mr. Wilding in counselling such a course. We've set our hands to the plough; let us go forward in God's name. Yet I would remind you that what Mr. Wilding says is true.

Of course, your men don't look smart, at present, and would not make a good show on a parade ground; but I hear {{that there are a}} large {{quantity}} of uniforms coming out, shortly; and I hope, long before the campaign opens, they will all be served out. The British regiments are almost as badly off as the native ones. However, I suppose matters will right themselves before the spring; but they are almost as badly off, now, as they were when they marched into Corunna. The absurdity of the whole thing is that all the newly-raised Portuguese levies, who will certainly not be called upon to cross the frontier <b>until</b> <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> have got uniforms; while the men who have to do the work are almost in rags." ...|$|E

6000|$|... (M82) For {{the moment}} ministers breathed freely, but {{the bill was}} soon in the trough of the sea.

The day after this conversation, the Queen wrote again to the archbishop, asking him seriously to reflect, in case the concessions of the government should not go quite so far as he might himself wish, whether the postponement of the settlement for another year would not be likely to result rather in worse than in better terms for the church. She trusted that he would himself consider, and endeavour to induce others to consider, any concessions offered by the House of Commons in the most conciliatory spirit, rather than to try and get rid of the bill. “The amendments,” said Mr. Gladstone, “seem to mean war to the knife.” ...|$|E
