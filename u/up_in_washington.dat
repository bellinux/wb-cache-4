25|$|By 1 October 1861, {{the first}} balloon, the Union, {{was ready for}} action. Though it lacked a {{portable}} gas generator, it was called into immediate service. It was gassed <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> and towed overnight to Lewinsville via Chain Bridge. The fully covered and trellised bridge required that the towing handlers crawl over the bridge beams and stringers to cross the upper Potomac River into Fairfax County. The balloon and crew arrived by daylight, exhausted from the nine-hour overnight ordeal, when a gale-force wind took the balloon away. It was later recovered, but not before Lowe, who was humiliated by the incident, went on a tirade about the delays in providing proper equipment.|$|E

500|$|... "Blood-Stained Banders" [...] {{was thus}} the {{proximate}} source {{for what was}} taught to guitarist Jorma Kaukonen by folk singer Roger Perkins and friend Tom Hobson in the early 1960s. [...] Kaukonen had grown <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C. {{and around the world}} as the son of a diplomat, then had migrated to the San Francisco Bay Area where he became a lover of various folk revival styles, especially acoustic blues and downhome blues. [...] The song became part of Kaukonen's repertoire as he played around San Francisco clubs, well before he joined Jefferson Airplane. [...] Kaukonen continued to evolve musically; the enticement of exploring the technology around the electric guitar led him to join the Airplane. [...] An evolving rendition of Kaukonen's imagining of the song is captured on a circulating recording of his May 21, 1968, performance at the Carousel Ballroom in San Francisco during a jam session of area musicians led by Jerry Garcia.|$|E
