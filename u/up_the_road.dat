5|$|In {{the early}} years, he was {{assisted}} {{by the man}} who had become his trusted prime-minister, Johan Göransson Gyllenstierna (1635–1680). Some sources say the king was basically dependent on Gyllenstierna,. His sudden death in 1680 opened <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> to the monarch, and many men tried to get close to the king to take Gyllenstierna's place.|$|E
5|$|About 10 a.m., one of Desha's neighbors {{encountered}} the riderless gray mare, still rigged with saddle and bridle. Catching the horse, he rode it <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> shortly finding Desha's riderless bay (which he recognized), with a saddle but no bridle. He noticed {{blood on the}} neck and withers of Desha's horse. Further along, the neighbor encountered Desha on foot, carrying two saddlebags. Desha {{said that he had}} just accepted the gray mare as payment from a man who owed him money. He did not volunteer how the two horses had escaped his control, but mounted the gray mare and returned home. Later that day, friends at Desha's tannery noticed that he was unusually quiet and repeatedly asked what was wrong. He said that he had been kicked by a horse and severely cut his finger in separate incidents the previous day.|$|E
5|$|As {{the forward}} {{companies}} {{began to move}} back towards the main defensive position, jeeps were sent up to collect the wounded while McKinna led a force of two platoons and two tanks out to the perimeter at the Hatai junction. There {{they were able to}} reclaim the mortars that had earlier been abandoned and destroyed them so that they could not be used against the Australians again, but the jeeps carrying the wounded ran into a Japanese ambush in which five Australians were killed. McKinna then organised a quick counterattack, taking a force <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> along with three tanks and subsequently attacking the ambushing force, killing 11, before forming a harbour around the tanks for the night.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of November 30, the 9th Infantry Regiment led the {{withdrawal}} by attacking the roadblock. Four tanks were first sent {{down the road and}} the Chinese held their fire. Encouraged by this development, Colonel Sloane ordered the 9th Infantry Regiment to press forward, but Chinese machine gun and mortar fire immediately stopped the advance at 9 a.m. The ROK 3rd Infantry Regiment attached to the 2nd Infantry Division was sent to reinforce the US 9th Infantry Regiment, but it was routed by friendly fire. With no contacts between the American commands and the British units, the Middlesex Regiment advanced to {{the south end of the}} valley without attacking the roadblock. Believing that the roadblock was short and the British were attacking <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> Keiser ordered the 2nd Infantry Division to run through the blockade at 10 a.m.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian {{attack on}} San Leonardo by the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada began late on 5 December 1943 with A Company {{establishing}} a bridgehead across the Moro, taking heavy casualties. In {{the early morning}} of 6 December, A Company was withdrawn and two additional Seaforth companies resumed the offensive. As PPCLI secured and held their bridgehead over the Moro River, the Seaforth Highlanders were struggling to enter San Leonardo. By 07:15, a single objective had been taken, with Canadian units pinned down by well-coordinated defensive fire from several companies of the 361st Regiment. Simultaneously, small arms fire prevented C Company from moving <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> from the Moro to San Leonardo, while D Company remained on the southern banks of the Moro throughout the early morning.|$|E
5|$|We were in {{a studio}} in New York, this place called the Magic Shop, and it had this thing called a tack piano there, which sounds like an old honky-tonk piano, where you put little tacks in the hammers, so it sounds like more of a {{harpsichord}} almost. And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample it, we went and bought an old piano from the shop <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> from our studio, and we bought a load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon spent a couple of hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers.|$|E

As it turned out, this advance led to the main battle.|$|R

5|$|During {{the early}} part of October, the British troops with their {{supplies}} and artillery made their way with difficulty <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> to prepare for the siege. When they were all in place the First Bombardment took place, starting on October 17. It had been expected that the bombardment would be effective and that the siege would be short-lived; certainly over before the winter. However, the Russians blew up one of the French magazines and the damage done by British gunfire was soon repaired. The British were running out of ammunition and supplies, winter was approaching and with the onset of bad weather the road became virtually impassable. Supplies were arriving at the crowded port of Balaclava but it was impossible to convey them to the besieging troops who were increasingly suffering from disease, frostbite and malnutrition. Conditions in Balaclava itself were also deteriorating.|$|E
5|$|Much as {{they had}} in {{previous}} stages, race leader Denis Menchov {{and the man in}} second place Danilo Di Luca stayed right with one another all through the climb, as Di Luca tried repeatedly to shed Menchov with attacks, but was unable to. Pellizotti, who had also been holding their wheels, took the opportunity with the two of them taking energy out of each other, to come clear and move into third position on the road. Basso, who was <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> dutifully sat up and waited for his better-placed teammate and paced him to a small gap over Menchov and Di Luca before cracking. It was enough to ensure Pellizotti second on the stage, to keep him third in the overall classification. Di Luca managed to outsprint Menchov to the line and claim 8 bonus seconds to narrow his deficit to 18 seconds, but with only a flat stage and an individual time trial remaining the superior time trialist Menchov had the advantage.|$|E
5|$|Now {{the vanguard}} of the US Eighth Army, the British and Australians crossed the Taedong River using a sand-bag bridge at Pyongyang at noon on 21 October, moving north on the main highway to Sukchon with the task of {{reaching}} the Chongchon River. Meanwhile, elements of US 3/187 RCT occupied Yongju. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Nielson, 1 ASHR subsequently pushed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> until fired upon by North Korean forces in the hills to the south of the town, with snipers engaging the column as it turned west out of the river valley around 16:00. Encountering only light resistance from a small North Korean force of approximately 75 men which was then scattered by tank fire, the Argylls successfully cleared the foothills by last light on 21 October. Approaching Yongju, Coad decided to halt for the night. The Argylls subsequently sent a patrol into the town, establishing initial contact with US 3/187 RCT, marrying up with K Company which was established in a number of houses on the northern edge of Yongju and on Hill 163 immediately above their position. A strong North Korean force was believed to be nearby, however, with at least 300 men thought to remain in the town.|$|E

5|$|The 27th British Commonwealth Brigade, {{which was}} leading the US Eighth Army general advance, was {{subsequently}} ordered forward to assist the American paratroopers. The British and Australians crossed the Taedong River at Pyongyang at noon on 21 October, and moved north on the main highway to Sukchon {{with the task of}} reaching the Chongchon River. The 1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highland Regiment (1 ASHR), subsequently pushed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> until fired upon by North Korean forces in the hills to the south of Yongju. By nightfall the hills were cleared by the Argylls, while the 3rd Battalion, US 187 RCT occupied Yongju. Cut-off, about midnight the North Korean 239th Regiment attempted to break out, resulting in heavy fighting between the Americans and North Koreans. The North Korean attacks drove the American paratroopers from Yongju, forcing them back onto the battalion's main defensive position to the north. 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR) was ordered to take the lead the following morning. By dawn the Americans again requested assistance. At first light on 22 October, two companies of Argylls advanced into Yongyu, before the Australians passed through them riding on US M4 Sherman tanks. Now leading the brigade, at 09:00 the Australians came under fire from a North Korean rearguard position in an apple orchard on their right flank.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, August 21, a US patrol of two platoons of {{infantry}} and M26 Pershing tanks went <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> toward the North Korean positions. White flags {{had appeared in}} front of the American line, and civilians in the area said many North Koreans wanted to surrender. The US patrol's mission was to investigate this situation and to form an estimate of North Koreans losses. The patrol advanced about , engaging small North Korean groups and receiving some artillery fire. On its way it destroyed five disabled North Korean tanks with thermite grenades. The patrol also found a 37mm anti-tank gun, two SU-76 self-propelled guns, and a 120mm mortar among the destroyed North Korean equipment, as well as recognizing a large number of North Korean dead. At the point of farthest advance, the patrol found and destroyed an abandoned T-34 tank in a village schoolhouse courtyard.|$|E
