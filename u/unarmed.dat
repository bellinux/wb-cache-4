5|$|The TV drama Scandal {{depicted}} Black Lives Matter in its March 5, 2015, {{episode that}} showed a police officer shooting an <b>unarmed</b> black teenager.|$|E
5|$|Deployment without weapons: On {{a number}} of occasions, {{soldiers}} were asked to deploy without weapons by UNTAG civilian officials. Early in the deployment Lieutenants Burchell and Stanner were asked by UNHCR to conduct an <b>unarmed</b> reconnaissance, but permission was refused. Near the election, Australian military electoral monitors were asked to deploy in civilian clothes without weapons.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with Japanese carrier doctrine at the time, Admiral Nagumo had kept {{half of his}} aircraft in reserve. These comprised two squadrons each of dive bombers and torpedo bombers. The dive bombers were as yet <b>unarmed.</b> The torpedo bombers were armed with torpedoes should any American warships be located.|$|E
5|$|Subsonic-cruise <b>unarmed</b> decoy: SCUD {{resembled the}} B-52 on radar. As an active decoy, it carried ECM and other devices, {{and it had}} a range of several hundred miles. Although SCUD was never {{deployed}} operationally, the concept was developed, becoming known as the air launched cruise missile (ALCM-A).|$|E
5|$|The German Air Force (Luftwaffe) {{initially}} {{ordered the}} reconnaissance RF-4E in 1969, receiving {{a total of}} 88 aircraft from January 1971. In 1982, the initially <b>unarmed</b> RF-4Es were given a secondary ground attack capability; these aircraft were retired in 1994.|$|E
5|$|The High Street {{station was}} the site of an {{attempted}} robbery of subway revenue on June 18, 1954, in which the <b>unarmed</b> perpetrator was fatally shot by one of the two armed transit employees collecting fares and already-used transfer slips from token booths.|$|E
5|$|The Police Tactical Unit (Hong Kong) of the Hong Kong Police Force used 87 {{rounds of}} CS {{projectiles}} (both riot gun launched and hand thrown) in Hong Kong on September 28, 2014 against hundreds of <b>unarmed</b> demonstrators demanding democratic elections during 2014 Hong Kong protests, {{also known as}} the Umbrella Movement.|$|E
5|$|The lowest ranking Century in the Centuriate Assembly was {{the fifth}} Century (called the proletarii) of the <b>unarmed</b> adjunct class. This Century was the only Century {{composed}} of soldiers who had no property, and since {{it was always the}} last Century to vote, it never had any real influence on elections. In 107 BC, in response to high unemployment and a severe manpower shortage in the army, the general and Consul Gaius Marius reformed the organization of the army, and allowed individuals with no property to enlist. As a consequence of these reforms, this fifth <b>unarmed</b> Century came to encompass almost the entire Roman army. This mass disenfranchisement of most of the soldiers in the army {{played an important role in}} the chaos that led to the fall of the Roman Republic in 27 BC.|$|E
5|$|Today, capoeira has staged {{somewhat}} of a comeback and is even studied in dance academies {{as part of a}} general movement to rejuvenate folk traditions. Capoeira may be played <b>unarmed</b> or with blades held in the hands or feet.|$|E
5|$|Another World is a {{platform}} game, featuring a control scheme where the player uses either the keyboard, joystick or gamepad {{to make the}} protagonist run, jump, attack and perform other, situation-specific actions, such as rocking a cage back and forth. In the initial part of the game, the player's character Lester is <b>unarmed.</b> He is able to kick at small creatures, but is otherwise defenseless.|$|E
5|$|Burnham and Armstrong leapt {{over the}} dead Mlimo {{and ran down}} a trail toward their horses. The warriors in the village nearby picked up their arms and searched for the attackers; to {{distract}} them, Burnham set fire to some of their huts. The two men escaped and rode back to Bulawayo. Shortly after, Cecil Rhodes walked <b>unarmed</b> into the Matabele stronghold and made peace with the rebels, ending the Second Matabele War.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, SS-Obersturmbannführer Joachim Peiper left {{a path of}} destruction, which {{included}} Waffen-SS soldiers under his command murdering American POWs and <b>unarmed</b> Belgian civilians in the Malmedy massacre. Captured SS soldiers {{who were part of}} Kampfgruppe Peiper were tried during the Malmedy massacre trial following the war for this massacre and several others in the area. Many of the perpetrators were sentenced to hang, but the sentences were commuted. Peiper was imprisoned for eleven years {{for his role in the}} killings.|$|E
5|$|Exercises were {{conducted}} using live ammunition and explosives to make training as realistic as possible. Physical fitness was a prerequisite, with cross country runs and boxing matches to improve fitness. Speed and endurance marches {{were conducted}} {{up and down}} the nearby mountain ranges and over assault courses that included a zip-line over Loch Arkaig, all while carrying arms and full equipment. Training continued by day and night with river crossings, mountain climbing, weapons training, <b>unarmed</b> combat, map reading, and small boat operations on the syllabus.|$|E
5|$|Fleming portrayed Bond as a tall, athletic, {{handsome}} {{secret agent}} {{in his thirties}} or forties; he has several vices including drinking, smoking, gambling, automobiles and womanizing. He is an exceptional marksman, and skilled in <b>unarmed</b> combat, skiing, swimming and golf. While Bond kills without hesitation or regret, he usually kills only when carrying out orders, while acting in self-defence and occasionally as revenge.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 a {{woman was}} found by a Police Community Support Officer (PCSO) acting suspiciously. When {{approached}} she produced a gun and pointed it at a passing young child. <b>Unarmed</b> PCSO George McNaught of the Metropolitan Police wrestled the gun out of the woman's hands before overpowering and detaining her. The woman was arrested and PCSO McNaught was awarded the commendation of the High Sheriff of Greater London for his brave actions. He is the first PCSO to receive the award.|$|E
5|$|In December, 2,000–3,000 people {{gathered}} at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, to protest the killings of <b>unarmed</b> black men by police. At least twenty members of a protest that had been using the slogan were arrested. In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, BLM protested the police shooting of Dontre Hamilton, who died in April. Black Lives Matter protested the shooting of John Crawford III. The shooting of Renisha McBride was protested by Black Lives Matter.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} of the Old West, tales tended to grow with {{repeated}} telling, and a single fight might grow into a career-making reputation. For instance, the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral made legends of Wyatt Earp and the Outlaw Cowboy gang, but they were relatively minor figures before that conflict. Some gunslingers, such as Bat Masterson, actively engaged in self-promotion. Johnny Ringo built a reputation as a gunslinger while never taking part in a gunfight or killing <b>unarmed</b> civilians.|$|E
5|$|Low, {{using his}} newly {{captured}} ship, lay in {{wait on the}} popular shipping route between Boston and New York. Within a few days, he and his crew seized a sloop out of Rhode Island and plundered it. His crew cut the rigging away to prevent the sloop returning too quickly to port to raise the alarm. He then captured a number of <b>unarmed</b> merchantmen near Port Rosemary.|$|E
5|$|Maeda {{not only}} taught {{the art of}} judo to Carlos Gracie, but also taught a {{particular}} philosophy {{about the nature of}} combat based on his travels competing and training alongside catch-wrestlers, boxers, savate fighters, and various other martial artists. The book details Maeda's theory that physical combat could be broken down into distinct phases, such as the striking phase, the grappling phase, the ground phase, and so on. Thus, it was a smart fighter's task to keep the fight located in the phase of combat that best suited his own strengths. The book further states that this theory was a fundamental influence on the Gracie approach to combat. The approach included armed versus armed, armed versus <b>unarmed,</b> <b>unarmed,</b> standing (tachiwaza, 立ち技), kneeling (suwariwaza, 座技), and ground work (newaza, 寝技), close quarters (hakuheijugi, 白兵主義), and other forms of combat. It was employed by other proponents of judo ('Kano jiu-jutsu') who, like Maeda, engaged in challenge match fighting overseas as judo spread internationally (e.g., Yukio Tani in the United Kingdom from 1905, Mikonosuke Kawaishi in France, and others).|$|E
5|$|On 11 October 1862, the Italian Navy {{placed an}} order with the British {{shipyard}} Mare of Millwall, London, for an armoured steam ram, to a design by the Italian naval officer Simone Antonio Saint-Bon, but financial problems {{resulted in the}} order being transferred to the shipyard Harrison, also of Millwall. Saint-Bon had originally intended the ship to be <b>unarmed,</b> relying only on its ram to sink enemy ships, but an engineer at Harrison revised the plan to include two large-caliber guns.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 30 August one of the {{transport}} aircraft's flight officers, a Barksdale-assigned B-52 instructor radar navigator, closely inspected the six missiles on the right wing only, which were all properly loaded with training warheads. The B-52 command pilot did not do a final verification check, before signing the manifest listing the cargo as a dozen <b>unarmed</b> AGM-129 missiles to depart Minot.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of June 27, a flight of five F-82 Twin Mustangs of the 68th Fighter Squadron and 339th Fighter Squadron, 8th Fighter Wing {{commanded}} by US Major James W. Little were escorting four C-54 Skymaster aircraft out of Kimpo. Little, a flying ace with experience in World War II, was {{the commander of the}} 339th Squadron. The four transports were <b>unarmed</b> and filled with civilians from the Seoul area, en route to Japan.|$|E
5|$|One major {{demonstration}} {{took place}} in the Shi'a island of Sitra, where several thousand men, women, and children took to the streets. According to witnesses interviewed by Physicians for Human Rights, hundreds of fully armed riot police arrived on the scene and immediately began firing tear gas and sound grenades into the crowds. They then fired rubber bullets into the <b>unarmed</b> crowd, aiming at people in the front line who had sat down in the street in protest.|$|E
5|$|Organised armed fighters {{on horseback}} are {{occasionally}} seen. The best-known current examples are the Janjaweed, militia groups {{seen in the}} Darfur region of Sudan, who became notorious for their attacks upon <b>unarmed</b> civilian populations in the Darfur conflict. Many nations still maintain small numbers of mounted military units for certain types of patrol and reconnaissance duties in extremely rugged terrain, including the conflict in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Philip {{had already}} begun war {{preparations}} at his home base near Mount Hope where he started raiding English farms and pillaging their property. In response, Governor Josiah Winslow called out the militia, and they organized and began to move on Philip's position. King Philip's men attacked <b>unarmed</b> {{women and children in}} order to receive a ransom. One such attack resulted in the capture of Mary Rowlandson. The memoirs of her capture provided historians with much information on Native American culture during this time period.|$|E
5|$|Security {{concerns}} {{related to}} crime and terrorism were not {{high on the}} agenda of the system's planners at its inception. After the Madrid train bombings in 2004 and the foiled plot to bomb the Yishun MRT Station in 2001, the operators deployed private, <b>unarmed</b> guards to patrol station platforms and conduct checks on the belongings of commuters, especially those carrying bulky items.|$|E
5|$|The basic close combat from {{previous}} installments has been heavily refined and expanded into the CQC system. When <b>unarmed</b> or using a one-handed weapon, Snake can grab opponents {{and put them}} in a chokehold, at which point a variety of actions can be performed, such as choking the enemy unconscious, slitting the enemy's throat, or interrogating them at knifepoint to obtain information. The context, pressure applied to the button, and movement of the analog stick determine the action performed.|$|E
5|$|The {{men of the}} 5th and 6th {{stayed at}} the depot {{throughout}} the night and into the next morning. If any individual needed to leave, they did so in civilian clothes and <b>unarmed,</b> for fear of the crowd should they be discovered {{to be a member}} of the militia. Camden Street remained under constant guard by 16 sentinels. They served in two-hour shifts, with four-hours' rest in between.|$|E
5|$|There was {{one report}} {{that her father}} gave Olga a small revolver, which she {{concealed}} in a boot while in captivity at Tsarskoe Selo and at Tobolsk. Colonel Eugene Kobylynsky, their sympathetic jailer, pleaded with the grand duchess to surrender her revolver before she, her sisters, and brother were transferred to Yekaterinburg. Olga reluctantly gave up her gun and was left <b>unarmed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to march}} with the able-bodied prisoners {{who were being}} {{directed}} to Fort Malden, Hart paid a friendly Indian {{to take him to}} the fort. Along the way they encountered other Indians, who shot and scalped Hart. Hart and an estimated 30–100 <b>unarmed</b> prisoners were killed by Indians on January 23, the day after the battle, in what became known as the River Raisin Massacre.|$|E
5|$|Al-Qaeda {{confirmed}} the death on May 6 with posts made on militant websites, vowing to avenge the killing. Other Pakistani militant groups, including the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, vowed retaliation against the U.S. and against Pakistan for not preventing the operation. The raid {{was supported by}} over 90% of the American public, was welcomed by the United Nations, NATO, the European Union {{and a large number}} of governments, but was condemned by others, including two-thirds of the Pakistani public. Legal and ethical aspects of the killing, such as his not being taken alive despite being <b>unarmed,</b> were questioned by others, including Amnesty International. Also controversial was the decision not to release any photographic or DNA evidence of bin Laden's death to the public.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no stand-your-ground law, the fact that {{necessary}} defense (unlike utmost necessity) {{is not subject to}} subsidiarity means that there is also no duty to retreat. The mere fact that a defender uses a weapon against <b>unarmed</b> attacker {{does not mean that the}} defense is disproportionate (and thus not legitimate) to the manner of the attack and the proportionality of defense does not depend on the relative effectiveness of the defender's weapon compared to the intensity of the attack, but on the manner in which the weapon is used (aiming at leg, i.e. intended non-deadly defense, may be proportionate where aiming at chest may be manifestly disproportionate, notwithstanding if the slug hits a leg artery and the attacker bleeds to death).|$|E
