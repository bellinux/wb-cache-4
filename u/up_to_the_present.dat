5|$|As the 1960s {{came to a}} close, folk rock {{changed and}} evolved away from the jangly {{template}} pioneered by The Byrds, but, Unterberger argues, the band's influence could still {{be heard in the}} music of Fairport Convention. Since the 1960s, The Byrds' jangly, folk rock sound has continued to influence popular music <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> day, with authors Chris Smith, Johnny Rogan, Mark Deming, and Stephen Thomas Erlewine all noting the band's influence on such acts as Big Star, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, R.E.M., The Long Ryders, The Smiths, The Bangles, The Stone Roses, Teenage Fanclub, and The La's.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in Shetland since the Mesolithic period. The {{earliest}} written references to the islands date back to Roman times. The early historic period was dominated by Scandinavian influences, especially from Norway, and the islands did not become part of Scotland until the 15th century. When Scotland {{became part of the}} Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, trade with northern Europe decreased. Fishing has continued to be an important aspect of the economy <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> day. The discovery of North Sea oil in the 1970s significantly boosted Shetland's economy, employment and public sector revenues.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of {{how long}} Surtsey will survive {{are based on the}} rate of erosion seen <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> day. Assuming that the current rate does not change, the island will be mostly at or below sea level by 2100. However, the rate of erosion is likely to slow as the tougher core of the island is exposed: an {{assessment}} assuming that the rate of erosion will slow exponentially suggests that the island will survive for many centuries. An idea of what it will look like in the future is given by the other small islands in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago, which formed {{in the same way as}} Surtsey several thousand years ago, and have eroded away substantially since they were formed.|$|E

5|$|From 1669, Klis Fortress {{was in the}} {{possession}} of the Venetians, and it remained so until the fall of the Venetian state. The Venetians restored and enlarged the fortress during their rule. After another, the seventh war with the Turks from 1714 to 1718, the Venetians were able to advance <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> Bosnian/Croatian border, taking in the whole Sinjsko field and Imotski. Thereafter the Turkish menace was laid to rest and Venice had no serious challenge to its authority in Dalmatia, until Napoleon extinguished the republic itself in 1797. The border between Christian and Muslim Europe had been moved further east, and the fortress lost its main strategic importance. Subsequently, Klis was taken by the Austrians. The last military occupation of Klis Fortress was by Axis powers during World War II.|$|E
5|$|In {{some parts}} of Iron Age Scotland, quite unlike almost all of {{recorded}} history right <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> day, there {{does not seem to}} have been an hierarchical elite. Studies have shown that these stone roundhouses, with massively thick walls must have contained virtually the entire population of islands such as Barra and North Uist. Iron Age settlement patterns in Scotland are not homogenous, but in these places there is no sign of a privileged class living in large castles or forts, or of an elite priestly caste or of peasants with no access to the kind of accommodation enjoyed by the middle classes.|$|E
5|$|After the Dissolution, {{two of the}} abbey's manors in Wiltshire {{were sold}} by the Crown to John Thynne and {{thereafter}} descended in his family, who much later became Marquesses of Bath. The Thynnes have preserved many of the abbey's Wiltshire records at Longleat <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> day. The ruins of the abbey itself was stripped of lead and dressed stones hauled away {{to be used in}} other buildings. The site was granted by Edward VI to Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset who established a colony of Protestant Dutch weavers on the site. When Seymour was attainted in 1551, the abbey site reverted to the crown, but the weavers remained until they were removed in the reign of Queen Mary. In 1559 Elizabeth I of England granted the site to Peter Carew, and it remained in private ownership until the beginning of the 20th century. Further stones were removed in the 17th century, so that {{by the beginning of the}} 18th century the abbey was described as a ruin. The only building to survive intact is the Abbot's Kitchen, which served as a Quaker meeting house. Early in the 19th century, gunpowder was used to dislodge further stones and the site became a quarry. The Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882 stopped further damage to the site and led to the first historical and archaeological surveys.|$|E

5|$|Stelae were {{considered}} to be invested with holiness and, perhaps, even to contain a divine soul-like essence that almost made them living beings. Some were apparently given individual names in hieroglyphic texts and {{were considered}} to be participants in rituals conducted at their location. Such rituals in the Classic Period appear to have included a k'altun binding ritual, in which the stela was wrapped in bands of tied cloth. This ritual was closely tied to the k'atun-ending calendrical ceremony. A k'altun ritual is depicted carved onto a peccary skull deposited as a funerary offering at Copán, the scene shows two nobles flanking a stela-altar pair where the stela seems to have been bound with cloth. The act of wrapping or binding a sacred object was of considerable religious importance across Mesoamerica, and is well attested among the Maya right <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> day. The precise meaning of the act is not clear, but may be to protect the bound object or to contain its sacred essence. The binding of stelae may be linked to the modern K'iche' Maya practice of wrapping small divinatory stones in a bundle.|$|E
