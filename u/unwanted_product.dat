40|$|Abstract only availableOver {{the past}} few years Dr. Quinn and his lab have made {{significant}} progress {{in the development of a}} melanoma treatment drug. Based upon peptide analogs of the alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone, Α-MSH, Dr. Quinn has developed a metal cyclized drug that shows very promising results in therapy as well as early detection/imaging of melanoma tumors. The cyclization of the peptide around a metal core was shown to greatly increase the affinity of the peptide for its target. There are slight problems with the cyclization process that needed to be resolved or limited in order to make the synthesis of the drug as efficient as possible. The primary problem with the cyclization of the peptide is the fact that two main products are produced. One of these products is caused by the histidine residue swinging down and binding with the metal core. Histidine is one of the four amino acids directly involved with receptor recognition and thus this product's tumor uptake is at least 50 % lower. Three variables were explored in hopes of reducing this second <b>unwanted</b> <b>product.</b> A new and simpler process developed by Fridkin et. al. ¹ was first considered. HPLC was used to purify the two major products and their identities were confirmed using mass spectrometry. The new procedure proved to be slightly more effective as the old procedure. With the old procedure roughly 32. 3 % of the two major products were of the undesired compound, however, using this new procedure this was reduced to 23. 4 %. A variation of the new procedure was then tried. Instead of dissolving the linear peptide in water, as the procedure called to do, the peptide was dissolved using DMF. This modification showed a significant change in the percentage of the two products. Of the two major products only 12. 8 % of the total was of the <b>unwanted</b> <b>product</b> thus producing 87. 2 % of the desired cyclized peptide. Finally an addition of an extra amino acid residue near the beginning of the sequence was tried in hopes of moving the histidine residue far enough away from the metal core in order to limit their interaction. Current tests are still being performed to determine whether or not this will be successful. (1) Fridkin, G., Bonsera, T. A., Litman, P., and Gilon, C. Nucl. Med Biol 32, 39 - 50, 2005.

40|$|Due to the {{combination}} of rapid influx of new technology, high pressure on time-to-market and increasing globalization, the number of products that have highly uncertain and dynamic specifications or customer requirements might significantly increase. In {{order to deal with}} these inherently volatile products or services, we need to adopt a more pro-active approach in order not to produce an <b>unwanted</b> <b>product</b> or service. Thus, based on the idea of the quality loss function and the zero-one goal programming, an intuitively simple mathematical model is developed to prioritize the quality characteristics (QCs) in the dynamic quality function deployment (QFD). It incorporates a pro-active approach towards providing products and services that meet the future voice of the customer (FVOC). The aim is to determine and prioritize only the ‘important’ QCs with a greater confidence in meeting the FVOC. It is particularly useful when the number of the potentially dominant QCs is very large so that, by using the prioritization, the size of the QFD can be effectively reduced. Some constraints, such as minimum customer satisfaction level and limitation on budget are also taken into consideration. A sensitivity analysis is suggested to give an insight to the QFD users in the change of parameters of the proposed model...|$|E

40|$|The {{tremendous}} {{increase in}} wireless communication {{over the last}} few decades has led to a congestion of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum, which is utilized for transmission and reception of information. As suitable RF spectrum is scarce, attempts are being made to use the RF spectrum in a more intelligent efficient way. A Cognitive Radio addresses this problem by Dynamic Spectrum Access, i. e. measure which spectrum is temporarily locally free and then use it. The Cognitive Radio transmitter needs to be flexible to be able to transmit where ever there is free spectrum available. Conventional transmitters not only produce the desired upconverted information signal but also many unwanted harmonics of the local oscillator (LO) and distortion products related to the baseband signal. These <b>unwanted</b> <b>products</b> have been usually suppressed using dedicated RF filters which are narrowband and are not flexible. For Cognitive Radio transmitters flexibility is a key requirement, and hence other techniques are wanted to suppress <b>unwanted</b> <b>products,</b> without using the inflexible filters. Moreover, agile operation of the cognitive radio transmitter in a broad band is wanted. Previous research has shown that polyphase multipath circuits can in principle cancel a large number of harmonics and distortion products. However, a solution for wideband polyphase baseband signal generation including digital-to-analog conversion and filtering was lacking. Moreover, the upconversion was done using a large number of paths which takes quite some chip area and is not very power efficient. In this work a less complex and more power efficient implementation of this technique is proposed. The proposal is actually based on a combination of three techniques, namely: 1) 8 -path polyphase upconversion, 2) tuning of the LO duty cycle ratio to close to 7 / 16 and 3) a tunable first order RF filter. The combination of these three techniques allows to suppress all <b>unwanted</b> <b>products</b> to more than 40 dB below the desired signal. It is possible to improve this further if a tunable RLC network with high quality factor is used at the RF output. The multiphase baseband signals required for an 8 -path upconversion can be generated using a simplified vector modulator type of architecture. In order to allow for a Spurious Free Dynamic Range of 50 dB, the use of a Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) with a resolution of at least 7 bits is proposed. It is shown {{that it is possible to}} cancel the first dominant DAC image by using a polyphase DAC architecture, which relaxes analog reconstruction filtering requirements. To verify the functionality of the proposed techniques, a flexible 8 -path transmitter chip was fabricated in a 160 nanometer CMOS technology. The transmitter works over 3 octaves in frequency from 100 MHz to 800 MHz. Measurements show that the frequency ii agile transmitter achieves a broadband clean output spectrum where all <b>unwanted</b> <b>products</b> are at least 40 dB below the wanted transmit signal. This is the first polyphase multi-path transmitter combining the baseband multi-phase generation and RF circuit on one chip. Compared to other harmonic rejection transmitter designs with similar frequency range, it is more power efficient and has better LO leakage and image rejection. Note that this chip suppresses ALL LO harmonics and distortion products for ALL frequencies, without any external filters...|$|R

As the LDPE industry becomes more competitive, manufacturers {{have to come out}} with solutions to debottleneck the reactor output while abiding to the stringent product specification.

40|$|AbstractFoam is a {{dispersion}} of gas in a liquid {{in which the}} distances between the gas bubbles are very small. Foams are frequently generated {{in the manufacture of}} many products as result from the aeration and agitation of liquids, from the vaporization of the liquid and also from biological or chemical reactions. Foams are generally an <b>unwanted</b> <b>product</b> in industrial processes because they cause difficulties in process control and in equipment operation. The most efficient conventional method for defoaming is the use of chemical agents but they contaminate the product. High-intensity ultrasonic waves offer a clean procedure to break foam bubbles. The potential use of ultrasound for foam breaking that was known since many years has been recently reinforced by the application of a new type of ultrasonic defoamer based on the stepped-plate high-power transducers to generate air-borne ultrasound. This defoamer has been successfully applied in several industrial problems such as the control of excess foam produced during the filling operation of bottles and cans on high-speed canning lines and in fermenting vessels and other reactors of great dimensions. The treatment of such industrial problems requires the proper characterization and quantification of the main parameters involved in the mechanisms of the defoaming effect.

40|$|Design and {{sustainability}} {{is about more}} than protecting the environment, although that's part of what is in fact a three-way equation- the so-called 'triple bottom line '- which takes in people and profit as well as environmental considerations. Truly sustainable design doesn't exploit the workforce or lead to other unwelcome social consequences, and it has the minimum environmental impact, but it doesn't sacrifice the profitability of the business either. All three considerations must interact. For instance, a product may be made from 'green ' materials which are sourced locally and so don't require a business to burn up resources to get them to the manufacturing plant. But if the business uses poorly paid workers and the product fails, the result will be an exploited workforce with poor employment prospects, and a large consignment of <b>unwanted</b> <b>product</b> heading for the nearest landfill. Sustainability requires commitment and an appreciation of the wider issues on behalf of both the designer and their client. Products that on the surface promote sustainability may not address deeper problems. For example, a product that recycles plastic cups doesn't tackle the wider issue of plastic cups being wastefully produced in the first place. Design is just one aspect of sustainability, but designers are powerful in that their specifications inform other stages such as procurement, manufacture and delivery. However the designer can't be the only one aware of sustainability-businesses and organisations need to work as a whole. Key words: design, sustainability, environment 1...|$|E

40|$|Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of {{pyrolysis}} oil is an upgrading step that allows further coprocessing {{of the oil}} product in (laboratory-scale) standard refinery units to produce advanced biofuels. During HDO, desired hydrotreating reactions are in competition with polymerization reactions {{that can lead to}} <b>unwanted</b> <b>product</b> properties. To suppress this polymerization, a low-temperature HDO step, referred to as stabilization, is typically used. Small batch autoclaves have been used to study at near isothermal conditions the competition between hydrotreating and polymerization reactions. Although fast polymerization reactions take place above 200 °C, hydrogen consumption was already observed for temperatures as low as 80 °C. Hydrogen consumption increased with temperature and reaction time; however, when the end temperature exceeded 250 °C, hydrogen consumption achieved a plateau. This was thought to be caused by the occurrence of fast polymerization reactions and the refractivity of the products to further hydrotreating reactions. The effect of the gas–liquid mass transfer was evaluated by using different stirring speeds. The results of these experiments (carried out at 300 °C) showed that in the first 5 min of HDO, gas–liquid mass transfer appears to be limiting the overall rate of hydrotreating reactions, leading to undesired polymerization reactions and product deterioration. Afterward, intraparticle mass transfer/kinetics seems to be governing the hydrogen consumption rate. Estimations on the degree of utilization (effectiveness factor) for industrially sized catalysts show that this is expected to be much lower than 1, at least, in the early stage of HDO (first 30 min). Catalyst particle size should, thus, be carefully considered when designing industrial processes not only to minimize reactor volume but also to improve the ratio of hydrotreating to polymerization reactions. ...|$|E
40|$|The hazard {{due to the}} {{unwanted}} formation of dangerous substances {{in the loss of}} control of a chemical industrial process is well known since the Seveso accident. The assessment of the inherent hazards related to the loss of control of a chemical process should include as well the identification of the hazards associated to the emission of possible products of unwanted reactions. This issue is among those that still need to be addressed in the design of inherently safe chemical processes. In the present study, a new approach was developed to screen the hazard profile of {{the unwanted}} products that may be formed as a consequence of process deviation from normal operating conditions. Three different categories of hazards were taken into account: acute and long-term hazard for humans, damage to ecosystems, environmental media contamination. The method allows the definition of a hazard footprint of the <b>unwanted</b> <b>product</b> mixture, and of four indices, each characterizing the potential impacts of release scenarios with respect to a specific category of hazards: acute toxicity, chronic toxicity, carcinogenicity and ecotoxicity. The four impact indices allow the identification of the more hazardous accidental scenarios that may derive from the loss of containment of the unwanted products during an accidental event. As confirmed by several case-studies, the application of the approach developed, coupled with an array of experimental protocols for the identification of the products formed under accidental conditions, results a useful tool for the screening of the potential hazards related to the formation and release of unwanted products in "out of control" conditions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The polynomial function representing nonlinear resistance contains only odd-power terms and a second polynomial function encapsulating capacitance and its asymmetry comprises of both even and odd-power terms. The coefficients of the model are extracted by fitting to measured amplitudes of the third-order mixing products and the local oscillator breakthrough over a range of the local oscillator drive powers, commonly encountered in practise. The model so extracted is validated by comparing its predictions with measured amplitudes of wanted and <b>unwanted</b> frequency <b>products,</b> as functions of local oscillator power at various local oscillator frequencies. The form of the polynomial model indicates the dominance of nonlinear resistance in the generation of the <b>unwanted</b> third-order mixing <b>products.</b> It also points to asymmetry of the capacitance-voltage characteristic as a possible reason behind unwanted local oscillator breakthrough in anti-parallel diode pair mixers. 8 page(s...|$|R

ACI {{may be caused}} by inadequate filtering (such as incomplete filtering of <b>unwanted</b> modulation <b>products</b> in FM systems), improper tuning or poor frequency control (in the reference channel, the interfering channel or both).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} mathematical {{modeling and}} simulation results for the cyclohexane oxidation {{in a series of}} stirred tank reactors. Cyclohexane oxidation is a complex reaction where the main two products, i. e. cyclohexanol and cyclohexanon are the intermediate products and further reaction will lead to the formation of some <b>unwanted</b> <b>products.</b> The selectivity of the desired products is usually poor if the conversion is high. Hence the effect of several operating variables including the number of reactors in series arrangement should be considered in the process design. In this work the model for cyclohexane oxidation in a series of stirred tank reactors was developed and therefore the steady state performances of the process are possible to be evaluated. The results are particularly useful for the decision making in the number of reactors to be used...|$|R
