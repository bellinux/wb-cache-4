25|$|By February, the US {{had stepped}} up {{diplomatic}} efforts to persuade emerging economies such as Brazil and India that China's intervention was {{the root cause}} of the currency war. However the <b>US</b> <b>once</b> <b>again</b> refrained from labelling China a currency manipulator. A Treasury report said that allowing for their high inflation, China was on track for an annual appreciation of 10% since they relaxed their currency peg back in June 2010. However treasury officials also suggested that this rate of appreciation is still insufficient either for the interests of the US, the wider global economy or even China itself.|$|E
500|$|Having {{returned}} {{to live in}} London, Vaughan Williams, with Ursula's encouragement, became much more active socially and in pro bono publico activities. He was a leading figure in the Society for the Promotion of New Music, and in 1954 he set up and endowed the Vaughan Williams Trust to support young composers and promote new or neglected music. He and his wife travelled extensively in Europe, and in 1954 he visited the <b>US</b> <b>once</b> <b>again,</b> having been invited to lecture at Cornell and other universities and to conduct. He received an enthusiastic welcome from large audiences, and was overwhelmed at {{the warmth of his}} reception. Kennedy describes it as [...] "like a musical state occasion".|$|E
500|$|When the {{election}} was held, there was a 12 percent swing towards the Liberal Party in South Australia, or 7 percent on two party preferred. There was a large swing against Labor owing to the dissatisfaction with the Whitlam administration, but it generally {{went directly to the}} Liberal Party. Against this background, and with relatively little media attention paid to the LM and its cause, Despite gaining prominence for his stance on supply, Hall struggled to be re-elected, gaining only 6.5 per cent of the Senate vote and relying on preferences, ironically from Labor. In South Australia, Labor gained 41 per cent of the vote, and the Liberals 51 per cent. In the lower house, the LM managed only 6.2% across the 12 seats, again recording its best result in Boothby, with 10.4%. Hall's hope for Australia-wide support for the LM was dashed owing to the previous events, with the party gaining negligible results for their candidates in other states. The lower house candidates in the Australian Capital Territory registered around 3%, but the senate candidates in Western Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland received less than 1%. Hall's opinion was that [...] "the Liberal Movement was for its part in the contest happy to have survived." [...] Nevertheless, Hall was still adamant the LM's future was as a standalone entity: [...] "The LM is going to continue as an Australia-wide party ... We shall {{have to go through the}} sickening process of having the Liberal party make overtures to <b>us</b> <b>once</b> <b>again</b> ... I would like to tell them right now that they will be wasting their breath." [...] Despite Hall's defiance, the poor showing meant his senate term was only to last for three rather than six years, and he no longer had the balance of power and the resulting media exposure. This was a problem, as the party was largely centred around his personality.|$|E

She added that if Nancy is [...] "as organised at being a mum as she is at being a journalist, then they will cope brilliantly!

Crick's colleague Laura Morgan commented on Nancy going into premature labour saying [...] "Our hearts were breaking for the couple as they faced the reality of their situation [...] we’re keeping our fingers crossed there will be a happy ending to their nightmare".

[...] The Swedish paper Göteborgs-Posten commented that [...] "without access to weapons, the killings at Virginia Tech might have been prevented" [...] because [...] "the fundamental reason is often the perpetrator's psychological problems in combination with access to weapons."

I Did It Again received an average score of seventy-two, based on twelve reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Giving the album {{four out of}} five stars, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted that the album [...] "has the same combination of sweetly sentimental ballads and endearingly gaudy dance-pop that made 'One More Time'," [...] but remarked that, [...] "Fortunately, she and her production team not only have a stronger overall set of songs this time, but they also occasionally get carried away with the same bewildering magpie aesthetic, [...] giv the album character apart from the well-crafted dance-pop and ballads that serve as its heart. In the end, it's what makes this an entertaining, satisfying listen." [...] Billboard magazine wrote that [...] "'Oops!...' indicates that she's developing a soulful edge and emotional depth that can't be conjured with a glass-shattering note," [...] praising the album for consistently cast Spears as a young woman coming to terms with her inner power—and that's a darn good message to offer an impressionable audience." [...] Entertainment Weeklys David Browne gave the album a B-rating, writing that the album [...] "reminds <b>us</b> <b>once</b> <b>again</b> that the best new pop can be a blast of cool air in a stifling room." ...|$|E
