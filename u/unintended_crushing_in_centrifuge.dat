40|$|Image {{analysis}} with video photography of targets was used <b>in</b> <b>centrifuge</b> tests to measure soil displacements. By tracing targets in soil using video cameras, the coordinates of targets were obtained. The displacements {{can be achieved}} by analyzing a pair of images. The setup of the measurement system and the method for correcting errors are presented. By calibration tests, both the accuracy and precision of the method are about 1 mm. The result of a consolidation test <b>in</b> <b>centrifuge</b> is comparable to the measurement of local transducers, demonstrating the usefulness of this method <b>in</b> <b>centrifuge</b> tests...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{centrifuge}} modeling where unsaturated {{soils are}} involved is more limited than {{its use in}} problems involving dry sand or saturated clays. This limitation is certainly due to the well-known experimental complexities related with unsaturated soils that increase <b>in</b> <b>centrifuge</b> modeling; on the other hand, few data is available about the scaling laws for unsaturated soils. In this paper, physical modeling of unsaturated soil problems <b>in</b> <b>centrifuge</b> is evaluated considering some phenomena involved {{in the behavior of}} those materials such as water migration, expansion and collapse. An overview of the scaling laws that has to be used is presented, with a selection of geotechnical problems studied on small-scale models <b>in</b> <b>centrifuge...</b>|$|R

Baby hamster kidney cells were infected with BTV {{with or without}} centrifugation. Viral antigen was detected by immunofluorescence at 24 h <b>in</b> both <b>centrifuged</b> and noncentrifuged cultures. However, after 24 h of infection, the production of PFU <b>in</b> <b>centrifuged</b> cell cultures was 10 - to 20 -fold greater than that seen <b>in</b> cultures not <b>centrifuged.</b> <b>In</b> addition, centrifugation enhanced the direct detection of PFU from blood samples collected from a sheep experimentally infected with BTV...|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of non-destructive techniques and dynamic methodologies {{to characterize the}} soil models at small strains <b>in</b> <b>centrifuge</b> <b>in</b> a layered medium are the principal objectives of this research. A equipment called mini Falling Weight Analyzer was developed to this purpose. The shear wave velocity was determined through a model soil using spectral analysis surface waves SASW. The tests were performed on a structure conformed by two layers, each layer was composed by intermediate and unsaturated soils. Shear waves velocity results attained from Bender element measurements shown that non-destructive techniques applied <b>in</b> <b>centrifuge</b> are a useful methodology to characterize a model at small strains...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{interactions}} <b>in</b> <b>centrifuge</b> modelling {{are often}} induced with external or not controlled sources. This paper presents {{a method to}} study Soil-Structure Interaction <b>in</b> <b>centrifuge,</b> {{with the use of}} a dynamic actuator developed for centrifuge testing. The dynamic actuator is employed into the model giving the possibility to test the dynamic response of a wind turbine structure, without any additional supporting accessory. The centrifuge soil model was instrumented in order to measure the wave propagation induced by the exited structure. Results regarding the actuator performance and the wave propagation inside the centrifuge model are presented...|$|R
40|$|Rainfall {{simulation}} <b>in</b> <b>centrifuge</b> {{models is}} important for modelling soil-atmosphere interactions. However, the presence of Coriolis force, drag forces, evaporation and wind within the centrifuge may affect the distribution of rainfall over the model. As a result, development of appropriate centrifuge rain simulators requires a demanding process of experimental trial and error. This paper highlights the key factors involved in controlling rainfall <b>in</b> <b>centrifuge</b> simulations, develops a mathematical model to simulate rainfall within a centrifuge and shows how to calibrate it experimentally. Finally, the paper summarises some important factors {{that should be considered}} in the development of rainfall simulators for centrifuges...|$|R

40|$|Palatal shelves from 13 - and 14 -day mouse embryos were excised and cultured in {{contiguous}} pairs. Experimental cultures {{were exposed}} to 2. 6 G in a culture centrifuge; controls {{were in the same}} incubator. After 24 hours, palates were prepared for light or electron microscopy. Scoring of paraffin sections according to the stage of fusion seen in the medial epithelial edges (MEE) showed that palates exposed to excess G were in more advanced stages of fusion than were controls. Ultrastructurally, control MEE had tightly apposed cell membranes and numerous desmosomes; <b>in</b> <b>centrifuged</b> MEE, desmosomes had been removed and there was much intercellular space. Nuclear membranes were intact in control MEE, but showed marked deterioration <b>in</b> MEE of <b>centrifuged</b> palates. Few lysosomes and no necrosis were seen <b>in</b> control MEE; <b>centrifuged</b> MEE had numerous lysosomes as well as necrotic cells. Basal lamina were intact in controls, but interrupted <b>in</b> <b>centrifuged</b> palates. The results confirm the hypothesis that gravitational increases speed up the differentiative process...|$|R
40|$|The soil {{specimen}} <b>in</b> a <b>centrifuge</b> {{model is}} subject to spatial variability depending on the method of sample preparation and the stress field induced by the centrifugal acceleration, {{even though it is}} intended to be uniformly prepared. In contrast to extensive measurements for studying the variability of in situ soil properties, soil variability <b>in</b> <b>centrifuge</b> models, especially that which is based on data at very close sampling distances, is less understood. In this paper, the variability of soil density <b>in</b> two <b>centrifuge</b> models is presented. Random field theory is adopted to characterize the spatial soil variability <b>in</b> the two <b>centrifuge</b> models. The importance of taking spatial variability parameters as a model similarity requirement <b>in</b> <b>centrifuge</b> model design is illustrated and discussed. It is demonstrated that, although centrifuge models of different sizes can be designed to simulate the same prototype, the prototypes these models actually represent are not identical in terms of soil spatial variability. To achieve similarity in spatial variability between a centrifuge model and its prototype, one may need to control either the point coefficient of variation or the scale of fluctuation of the model soil so that the coefficients of variation of the spatially averaged soil property in the model and the prototype are the same...|$|R

These techniques allow the system to distribute raindrops uniformly and minimize the size effect of raindrops and the inclination of raindrops due to Coriolis effects.

40|$|Reinforcing {{compressible}} soils by rigid inclusions is {{a method}} to reduce and homogenize settlements under many types of structures. A granular mattress, located between the structure and the group of piles, transfers part of the loads on the surface {{to the head of}} the piles anchored in rigid substrate. An experimental device, a mobile tray, has been especially designed in order to allow a better understanding of this reinforcement technique. This mobile tray simulates the settlement of the soft ground (not present here) located between the piles. With this device, a parametric study of the loadtransfer mechanism in the mattress is conducted <b>in</b> <b>centrifuge</b> at 20 g. Loads at the top of the piles and settlements at different places above the granular mattress are measured during the the mobile tray going down. A possible way to improve this reinforcement technique is to insert a geosynthetic layer between the head of the piles and the granular mattress. <b>In</b> <b>centrifuge,</b> due to scaling laws, the choice of the geosynthetic has to be taken very carefully. Tests with and without geosynthetic are performed for different thicknesses of granular mattress. Then the improvement of the load-transfer mechanism by the addition of a geosynthetic is studied <b>in</b> <b>centrifuge...</b>|$|R
