40|$|The thesis aims {{to address}} issues {{concerning}} technical piano playing by university students.

The exercise methods discussed in the text lay much better foundations for technical piano playing, highlight the importance of consciousness as the key factor in the process, and make the piano player examine the musical text with much more rigour. The core of the thesis is not only the detailed discussion of Russian etudes that are only rarely played in the Czech Republic but also a reflection on the piano exercise itself that brings the player towards efficient and meaningful work with the instrument...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- The {{proposed}} {{diagnostic method}} {{is based on}} signal processing procedures applied to information coming from the structure under investigation and generated by both natural and designed stimuli which may also be different in nature. The discrimination of signals acquired by each sensor and coming contemporarily from different sources allows to identify various anomalies in the {{different parts of the}} structure. An effective mathematical procedure is proposed with an aim to distinguish the contribution of each source from the entire information collected. After a preliminary calibration performed using designed stimulation, the diagnostic system is applied to apparatuses under normal operating conditions through the following steps: data acquisition by means of sensors and transducers; processing and discrimination of the acquired data <b>using</b> <b>specific</b> <b>analysis</b> software; comparisons of the processed information so as to isolate common characteristics and consequently identify significant diagnostic parameters; data post-processing to recognize a number of belonging classes so as to define the state of the different parts of the structure. The method was applied with slight changes to diagnose a number of different electromechanical structures such as power transformers, circuit breakers, railway components, joints and terminations of MV and HV cables.

40|$|Cultural {{studies have}} been characterised, from its origins, by its {{interdisciplinary}} character (Bennett, 1998 : 27; Barker, 2004 : 42). However, attempts in this field of discipline of <b>using</b> <b>specific</b> <b>analysis</b> tools to the language have been virtually inexistent (Grossberg, 1997 : 5; Barker and Galasinski, 2001 : 27; Barker, 2002 : 44). Indeed, often, cultural studies have operated essentially abstract notions of language, which has not resulted in detailed textual analysis of linguistic science themselves. However, given {{the central role of}} language in cultural practices of representation, one could envisage the extent to which cultural analysis could benefit from linguistic analysis perspectives approaching the study of language in particular contexts of use. Such is the case of pragmatics, as "study of contextual meaning" (Yule, 1996 : 3). To shed light on the pragmatic instrumentality towards cultural studies in general and the analysis of popular culture in particular, in this article we approach an area of pragmatics as the theory of conventional implicatures. In particular, we outline here a study of conventional implicatures in the new generation of British men's magazines and try to illustrate how the masculine ideology underlying the use of language of these journals are divided into specific conventional implicatures...|$|E
40|$|In {{a typical}} modern {{distributed}} system, {{a number of}} components are running simultaneously. Each of the components exhibits relatively simple behaviour which can be (and usually is) specified extensively in the documentation of the system. However, the behaviour of {{the system as a}} whole, consisting of all these components running in parallel, tends to become very complex as more components are added to the system. Consequently, trying to understand or describe all situations that may possibly occur in the system, apart from the desired behaviour, becomes a formidable task. The purpose of the research documented in this thesis is to analyze a part of an Embedded Software Reference Architecture (ESRA) and a prototype of an Automatic Document Feeder (ADF). These systems can be used in Océ’s printing machines. <b>Using</b> <b>specific</b> <b>analysis</b> methods and techniques, we try to find erratic situations in each of these systems by considering all possible states that the system can reach starting from its initial state. Basically, an abstract model is constructed that specifies the behaviour of the real system. Next, this model is checked for violations of some of the requirements or desired properties. To these ends, toolsets and languages have been used in which behaviour can be specified and checked for violation of certain properties. These properties are expressed by formulas in a modal logic. As it turns out, both ESRA and the ADF violate some of the properties that were checked on them...|$|E

We assessed the feasibility of pulse transit time (PTT) in detecting subcortical arousals in eight infants (median age 7 days) suffering from the Pierre Robin sequence and obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep studies including recordings of PTT performed before and after successful orthodontic treatment for their OSA were analyzed. PTT arousals (i. e., fall in PTT by a parts per thousand yen 15 ms lasting for a parts per thousand yen 3 s) were visually scored <b>using</b> <b>specific</b> <b>analysis</b> software. Apnea-related PTT arousals and spontaneous PTT arousals were distinguished and predicting factors for the occurrence of uninterpretable PTT signal and PTT arousals were analyzed. Six-hundred and seven apneas were analyzed. Uninterpretable PTT signal appeared in 394 (65 %) apneas and were due to a disturbed pulse waveform in 63 %. Predictors for the occurrence of uninterpretable PTT signal were type of apnea (odds ratio, 95 % confidence interval for obstructive apnea = 0. 5, 0. 4 - 0. 9) and duration of apnea (odds ratio, 95 % confidence interval per second duration = 1. 4, 1. 3 - 1. 5). Of 213 apneas with interpretable PTT signal, 43 (7 % of all apneas) were followed by a PTT arousal. Predictor for their occurrence was treatment status (odds ratio, 95 % confidence interval for pre-treatment status = 3. 4, 1. 3 - 8. 8). Spontaneous PTT arousals during control periods appeared more frequently pre-treatment compared to post-treatment (41 % vs. 16 %; p-value = 0. 001). There were only weak correlations between changes in PTT, heart rate, and arterial oxygen saturation (correlation coefficient < 0. 3). The feasibility of PTT in scoring apnea-related subcortical arousals in infants may be questionable. However, scoring spontaneous PTT arousals may be an approach for assessing sleep disruption in infants with obstructive sleep apnea...|$|E

40|$|The three tandem-arrayed protocadherin (Pcdh) gene clusters, namely Pcdh-α, Pcdh-β, and Pcdh-γ, play {{important}} roles {{in the development of}} the vertebrate central nervous system. To gain insight into the molecular action of PCDHs, we performed a systematic proteomics analysis of PCDH-γ-associated protein complexes. We identified a list of 154 non-redundant proteins in the PCDH-γ complexes. This list includes nearly 30 members of clustered Pcdh-α, -β, and -γ families as core components of the complexes and additionally over 120 putative PCDH-associated proteins. We validated a selected subset of PCDH-γ-associated proteins <b>using</b> <b>specific</b> antibodies. <b>Analysis</b> of the identities of PCDH-associated proteins showed that the majority of them overlap with the proteomic profile of postsynaptic density preparations. Further analysis of membrane protein complexes revealed that several validated PCDH-γ-associated proteins exhibit reduced levels in Pcdh-γ-deficient brain tissues. Therefore, PCDH-γs are required for the integrity of the complexes. However, the size of the overall complexes and the abundance of many other proteins remained unchanged, raising a possibility that PCDH-αs and PCDH-βs might compensate for PCDH-γ function in complex formation. As a test of this idea, RNA interference knockdown of both PCDH-αs and PCDH-γs showed that PCDHs have redundant functions in regulating neuronal survival in the chicken spinal cord.
