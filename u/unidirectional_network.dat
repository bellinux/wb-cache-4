40|$|Abstract Most of routing {{protocols}} {{designed for the}} Internet today are for networks with bidirectional links. These protocols cannot be easily extended to <b>networks</b> with <b>unidirectional</b> links without increasing cost. In [1], Chen et al. presented a distance-vector-based routing protocol for <b>unidirectional</b> <b>networks</b> where a routing table is derived for each node in the network. In this paper, we extend the protocol in [1] by keeping one path for each outgoing link of a node to maintain multiple paths in the corresponding routing table. The path for a specific outgoing link is the shortest path from the node to the destination through that outgoing link. Thus, the protocol provides alternative paths that are vital in the dynamic network environment.

40|$|We {{address the}} {{question}} of distributively computing over a strongly connected <b>unidirectional</b> data communication <b>network.</b> In <b>unidirectional</b> <b>networks</b> the existence of a communication link from one node to another does not imply the existence of a link in the opposite direction. The strong connectivity means that from every node there is a directed path to any other node. We assume an arbitrary topology network in which the strong connectivity is the only restriction. Four models are considered: Synchronous and asynchronous, and for each we consider node space availability which grows as either O(1) bits or O(log n) bits per incident link, where n is the total number of nodes in the network. First we provide algorithms for two basic problems in distributed computing in data communication networks, traversal, and election.
