50|$|The first {{investigations}} of HIFU for non-invasive ablation {{were reported by}} Lynn et al. in the early 1940s. Extensive important early work was performed in the 1950s and 1960s by William Fry and Francis Fry at the University of Illinois and Carl Townsend, Howard White and George Gardner at the Interscience Research Institute of Champaign, Ill., culminating in clinical treatments of neurological disorders. In particular High Intensity ultrasound and ultrasound visualization was accomplished stereotaxically with a Cincinnati precision milling machine to perform accurate ablation of brain tumors. Until recently, clinical trials of HIFU for ablation were few (although significant work in hyperthermia was performed with <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>heating),</b> perhaps due {{to the complexity of}} the treatments and the difficulty of targeting the beam noninvasively.

The influence of various green colour protection reagents and treatment conditions on the colour of bamboo culms was examined using a colour difference meter.

40|$|Photoacoustic (PA) imaging of {{arbitrarily}} shaped or oriented objects may miss {{important features}} because PA waves propagate normal to structure boundaries and may miss the acoustic detectors when the detection view has a limited angular range. To overcome this long-standing problem, we present an ultrasonic thermal encoding {{approach that is}} universally applicable. We exploit the temperature dependence of the Grueneisen parameter and encode a voxel using heat generated by a focused ultrasonic transducer. The PA amplitude from the encoded voxel is increased while those from the neighboring voxels are unchanged. Consequently, the amplitude-increased PA waves propagate in all directions due to the round {{cross section of the}} encoded region and thus can be received at any viewing angle on the cross-sectional plane. We built a mathematical model for the thermally encoded PA tomography, performed a numerical simulation, and experimentally validated the ultrasonic thermal encoding efficiency. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate full-view in vivo vascular imaging and compare it to the original linear-array PA tomography system, showing dramatically enhanced imaging of arbitrarily oriented blood vessels.

40|$|In this study, {{investigations}} into phonophoresis {{were conducted by}} employing 3 distinct in vitro models. The aim of the first model was to evaluate the effect of ultrasound on the migration rate of different classes of molecules through agar gel. The derived data suggested that small, relatively hydrophobic molecules {{are more susceptible to}} ultrasound-enhanced diffusion through the water-filled channels of the agar gel. The application of heat alone increased drug migration by a similar magnitude as the ultrasound, indicating that <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>heating</b> directly increases the thermodynamic potential for diffusion. In the second experimental system, whole rat skin was pre-sonicated and then examined for changes in its barrier properties. At high intensities (1 to 2 W cm- 2), ultrasonic waves irreversibly compromised the barrier properties of the skin, following the general patterns described in the literature reports. At low intensities (< 1 W cm- 2), ultrasound discharged sebum from the sebaceous glands so as to fill much of the hair follicle shafts. This entirely novel phenomenon is probably produced by the mechanical effects of the beam. The deposition of sebaceous lipids within the hair follicle shafts can mean that this absorption pathway is blocked for hydrophilic molecules that penetrate via this route. Consequently, this phenomenon can be utilised as a probe to measure the relative follicular contribution to total penetration for these molecules. In the final phonophoresis model, modified Franz cells were employed in order to assess the ultrasound effect on the concurrent transdermal permeation of various molecules through whole rat skin.

The common procedure used involves initial water washing to remove fines then Aqua Regia treatment followed by density separation using lithium silicon tungstate then magnetic separation and finally selective etching of powder samples by <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>heating</b> and agitation in a dilute aqueous (~ 2 % w/w) hydrofluoric acid solution (HF). This technique has proven adequate for quartz rich rock types (ie granite, quartzite). The etching method alone typically involves 4 - 5 cycles of HF 2 % etchings and the result is ~ 10 - 30 % mass loss. However for fine grained and or low quartz (non-felsic) bearing samples such as flint, silcrete, andesite, diorite) density and magnetic separation are inefficient. Furthermore, HF etching will readily dissolve fine quartz grains and thus severely affects yields. We have developed an alternative method using hot phosphoric acid (~ 250 °C), which preferentially dissolves silicates and many other minerals but not quartz. Differentiation of quartz from other minerals (e. g., feldspars, plagioclase) is excellent, density and magnetic separation is not required and usually fewer cycles are required than with conventional HF etching. Hence the hot phosphoric acid method is particularly effective on rocks containing fine grain quartz, e. g., greywacke, silcrete and chert, to enhance quartz recovery. As a bonus this method will bulk extract zircons if required. The technique is far more cost effective by using cheap commercial grade reagents and reduced risk compared to handling highly hazardous HF solutions.

In {{the state of the}} art processes, these profiles are pre-bonded with conduction- and convection-based heating methods, which are time consuming and inefficient. At the Center for Lightweight Production Technology (ZLP) of the German Aerospace Centre in Stade a new method for pre-bonding was patented and the foundation for industrialization was laid by extensive research. By using inductive heating, the process time for the pre-bonding of stringers is reduced from 30 - 45 seconds to 3 - 5 seconds per adhesive point. In cooperation with Premium Aerotec GmbH the applicability to Airbus A 350 fuselage panel manufacturing was investigated. A comparison to <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>heating</b> and {{the state of the art}} pre-bonding method as well as the development and testing of automation concepts were performed. While the technique reached the next phase on the way to series production several findings emerged, which may require further process adaptions. To control the temperature on the bottom side repeatable and independent from stringer type or side attempts to regulate the process were made. Based on optical temperature measurements on the stringer’s top surface, the induction generator power was adjusted using different algorithms. Then several experiments were performed to establish a relation between top and bottom side temperatures in fast processes. Thermographic analysis showed that hotspots occurred during the heating process of A 350 stringers, which worsened the temperature homogeneity and shrunk the process window. The problem was considered to be related to the junctions between different plies and could be solved by using an alternative induction coil design. Additionally, this new coil design is supposed to increase overall temperature homogeneity and decrease material dependencies significantly. It makes the process much more controllable. This paper summarizes the methods used to confront inductive heating with ultrasonic and the state of the art technology. Furthermore the automation concepts and thoughts on quality assurance are presented.

40|$|Purpose: Treatment of {{malignant}} tumors {{by either}} hyperthermia induced drug delivery or thermal ablation requires complete {{coverage of the}} treatment area and precise control of the thermal dose. Both {{can be achieved by}} volumetric <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>heating</b> in combination with simultaneous MR-based temperature mapping.

Mouse and rat studies are preferred over largeranimals for ethical reasons as well as the larger variety of available tumor models. Our work aims to develop temperature induced drug delivery and ablation protocols in rats and to subsequently evaluatetreatment outcome using small animal imaging methods. To this end, we adapted a clinical MR-HIFU system for the treatment of rats by utilizing a dedicated small animal setup. Methods: All animals were positioned in a HIFU dedicated small animal 4 -channel MR volume coil that was used as add-on to a clinical 3 T Philips Sonalleve MR-HIFU system. Hyperthermia was performed for 15 min using binary temperaturecontrol on lateral gastrocnemius muscle (n = 5) and on subcutaneousinoculated tumors on the hind limb of rats (9 L rat glioma; n = 5). For thermal ablation, tumors were partly heated to T = 65 °C with continuous wave ultrasound (1. 44 MHz) under MR temperature monitoring(n = 5). The treatment effect was assessed with T 2 -weighted imagingand dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE-) MRI using Gd-DTPA as contrast agent. Excised muscle and tumors were further evaluated with histology. Results: The target temperatures were readily achieved in hyperthermia and ablation treatments while changes in body temperature remained below 1 °C. For hyperthermia treatments, no indication of tissue damage was found on MR images. Analysis of the Gd-DTPA uptake kinetics post ablation indicated a difference in non-perfused volume inthe tumor of 371 ± 123 mm 3 (&# 916; tissue volume with ktrans &# 8805; 0. 04 min- 1). NADH-diaphorase staining of ablated tumors showed a sharp demarcation between viable and non-viable cells.

This approach provides all theadvantages of clinical MR-HIFU, such as volumetric heating, temperature feedback control and a clinical software interface, while also having many of the advantages of a dedicated small animal system.
