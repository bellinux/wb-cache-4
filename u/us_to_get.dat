She was {{the first woman to}} {{graduate}} from medical school, a pioneer in promoting the education of women in medicine in the United States, and a social and moral reformer in both the United States and in the United Kingdom. Her sister Emily was the third woman in the <b>US</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a medical degree.|$|E

500|$|There are {{obstacles}} to reestablishing lacrosse as an Olympic sport. One hurdle was resolved in 2008, when the international governing bodies for men's and women's lacrosse merged to form Federation of International Lacrosse. [...] Another obstacle is insufficient international participation. In {{order to be}} considered as an Olympic sport the game must be played on four continents, and {{with at least a}} total of 75 countries participating. [...] According to one US Lacrosse representative in 2004, [...] "it’ll take 15-20 years for <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> there." [...] For the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia and 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, efforts were made to include lacrosse as an exhibition sport, but these failed.|$|E

500|$|On August 31, 1967, in a taped {{interview}} with locally influential (and nationally syndicated) {{talk show host}} Lou Gordon of WKBD-TV in Detroit, Romney stated: [...] "When I came back from Viet Nam , I'd just had the greatest brainwashing that anybody can get." [...] He then shifted to opposing the war: [...] "I no longer {{believe that it was}} necessary for <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> involved in South Vietnam to stop Communist aggression in Southeast Asia." [...] Decrying the [...] "tragic" [...] conflict, he urged [...] "a sound peace in South Vietnam at an early time." [...] Thus Romney disavowed the war and reversed himself from his earlier stated belief that the war was [...] "morally right and necessary".|$|E
500|$|Aaliyah {{admitted}} in court documents {{that she had}} lied about her age. In May 1997, she filed suit in Cook County seeking to have all records of the marriage expunged because she was not old enough under state law to get married without her parents' consent. It was reported that she cut off all professional and personal ties with R. Kelly after the marriage was annulled and ceased having contact with him. In 2014, Jomo Hankerson stated that Aaliyah [...] "got villainized" [...] over her relationship with R. Kelly and the scandal over the marriage {{made it difficult to}} find producers for her second album. [...] "We were coming off of a multi-platinum debut album and except for a couple of relationships with Jermaine Dupri and Puffy, it was hard for <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> producers on the album." [...] Hankerson also expressed confusion over why [...] "they were upset" [...] with Aaliyah given her age at the time.|$|E
500|$|... "Northern Lites" [...] {{was written}} by singer Gruff Rhys about [...] "the weather", and was {{particularly}} inspired by coverage of the [...] "terrifying, worldwide, seven-year phenomenon" [...] of the west Pacific El Niño climate pattern on [...] "weather channels" [...] in 1998. The song's title refers to the Aurora Borealis, a natural light display which can be observed particularly in the polar regions, and usually at night. The band were convinced that they had seen the lights before the track was written but, as no-one else was present, they could not get confirmation that what they had witnessed {{was not simply a}} [...] "Furry fantasy". Rhys has claimed that he would have called the song [...] "Aurora Borealis" [...] but [...] "Latin song titles are out of the question". Although Rhys has said that the song is [...] "about asking Jesus if he decides to seek his revenge on <b>us,</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it over with as soon as possible and blow us away to the Northern Lights" [...] he has also stated that, although some critics have interpreted the track as being about [...] "questioning one's faith", it is really [...] "just a song about the weather".|$|E

[...] During the camp, she participated in a series of scrimmages against the United States. [...] That month, she also represented Australia at the Six Nations Cup that was held in Sydney. She {{was a member}} of the Stingers squad that competed in the 2010 FINA World Cup. She was again the captain during this tournament, and on the second day of the competition, helped lead her team to a 7–5 victory of the United States. She competed Australia's 10–8 defeat of Russia. Her coach was quoted in The Age about her performance in the match, saying [...] "Bronwen Knox was excellent at centre back and the pressure allowed <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> steals and counter-attacks." [...] In the team's 10–8 final victory over the United States, she scored two goals. In April 2011, she attended a training camp at the Australian Institute of Sport where the coach was [...] "selecting a team for the major championships over winter." [...] In 2011, she was one of five Queensland women to compete for the Australian Stingers in the FINA World League competition held in Auckland, New Zealand. [...] In a May 2011 match against China, she scored three goals in a 9–7 game that saw Australia score six goals in the second period.|$|E
500|$|Shaw {{maintained}} a provocative and frequently self-contradictory attitude to Shakespeare (whose name {{he insisted on}} spelling [...] "Shakespear"). Many found him difficult to take seriously on the subject; Duff Cooper observed that by attacking Shakespeare, [...] "it is Shaw who appears a ridiculous pigmy shaking his fist at a mountain." [...] Shaw was, nevertheless, a knowledgeable Shakespearian, and {{in an article in}} which he wrote, [...] "With the single exception of Homer, there is no eminent writer, not even Sir Walter Scott, whom I can despise so entirely as I despise Shakespear when I measure my mind against his," [...] he also said, [...] "But I am bound to add that I pity the man who cannot enjoy Shakespear. He has outlasted thousands of abler thinkers, and will outlast a thousand more". Shaw had two regular targets for his more extreme comments about Shakespeare: undiscriminating [...] "Bardolaters", and actors and directors who presented insensitively cut texts in over-elaborate productions. He was continually drawn back to Shakespeare, and wrote three plays with Shakespearean themes: The Dark Lady of the Sonnets, Cymbeline Refinished and Shakes versus Shav. In a 2001 analysis of Shaw's Shakespearian criticisms, Robert Pierce concludes that Shaw, who was no academic, saw Shakespeare's plays—like all theatre—from an author's practical point of view: [...] "Shaw helps <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away from the Romantics' picture of Shakespeare as a titanic genius, one whose art cannot be analyzed or connected with the mundane considerations of theatrical conditions and profit and loss, or with a specific staging and cast of actors." ...|$|E
2500|$|In general, {{recovery}} {{may be seen}} as more of {{a philosophy}} or attitude than a specific model, requiring fundamentally that [...] "we regain personal power and a valued place in our communities. Sometimes we need services to support <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> there".|$|E
