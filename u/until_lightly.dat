60|$|From the parapet, in the afternoon, he {{had gained}} an {{accurate}} {{idea of the}} position of the cavalry, and toward this he at once made his way. He took off his boots and walked <b>lightly</b> <b>until</b> he approached the enemy's bivouac. Then he went cautiously. The ground was covered with sleeping figures, all wrapped like mummies in their clothes; and although the night was dusk, it was easy in the starlight to see the white figures. Even had one been awake, Dick had little fear, as, except near a fire, his figure would have been indistinguishable. There was no difficulty, when he neared the spot, in finding the horses, as the sound of their pawing the ground, eating, and the occasional short neigh of two quarreling, was clearly distinguishable.|$|R
50|$|All Mossberg models {{including}} the 835, 535, 500, 505 and 590 (except for Special-Purpose and Law Enforcement models) are shipped {{with a wooden}} dowel with two rubber O-rings, also called a duck plug, located in the tube magazine. This is to comply with U.S. migratory bird laws. This dowel reduces and regulates the number of shells that can be loaded in the magazine to 2. This can be removed by taking off the barrel, pointing the shotgun downward, and shaking {{it back and forth}} <b>lightly</b> <b>until</b> the dowel shows out {{of the end of the}} magazine tube. It must then be pulled out, the O-rings prevent it from just falling out. Except for the Maverick 88, all Mossberg models have a pre-drilled receiver for installation of an upper Picatinny rail for mounting various optics such as red dot sights. Some models can be bought with the rail and accessories already installed.|$|R
60|$|The steel trap {{used for}} {{catching}} foxes is of {{exactly the same}} form as the ordinary rat-trap, with this difference, that it has two springs instead of one, is considerably larger, and has no teeth, as these latter would only tend to spoil the skin. Owing {{to the strength of}} the springs, a pretty strong effort is required to set the trap, and clumsy fellows frequently catch the tails of their coats or the ends of their belts, and not unfrequently the ends of their fingers, in their awkward attempts. Having set it without any of the above untoward accidents occurring, Harry placed it gently on a hole which he had previously scraped--placing it in such a manner that the jaws and plate, or trigger, were a hairbreadth below the level of the snow. After this he spread over it a very thin sheet of paper, observing as he did so that hay or grass was preferable; but as there was none at hand, paper would do. Over this he sprinkled snow very <b>lightly,</b> <b>until</b> every vestige of the trap was concealed from view, and the whole was made quite level with the surrounding plain, so that even the accountant himself, after he had once removed his eyes from it, could not tell where it lay. Some chips of a frozen ptarmigan were then scattered around the spot, and a piece of wood left to mark its whereabouts. The bait is always scattered round and not on the trap, as the fox, in running from one piece to another, is almost certain to set his foot on it, and so get caught by the leg; whereas, were the bait placed upon the trap, the fox would be apt to get caught, while in the act of eating, by the snout, which, being wedge-like in form, is easily dragged out of its gripe.|$|R
40|$|AbstractPatients {{may find}} {{bronchoscopy}} without sedation unpleasant. There {{is some evidence}} that patient satisfaction correlates with amnesia for the procedure. For several years we have used doses of midazolam sufficient to put patients lightly asleep hoping to produce complete amnesia. We looked at practical aspects of this technique over a 2 -year period. We studied 337 consecutive patients. They were 219 men and 118 women of mean age 63 ± 12 · 4 (sd). Sixty-seven patients were aged 75 years or over and the eldest was 86. Sixty-three patients were already hospital inpatients but the remainder were seen as day cases. Midazolam was given by slow i. v. injection over several minutes until the patient was judged to be lightly asleep. Patients were given supplemental oxygen (3 l min− 1) and monitored by ECG and pulse oximetry. A note was made of the time at which they awakened, defined as when nursing staff felt the patients were awake enough to have a cup of tea and toast. Patients were asked if they had any memory of the procedure both on awakening and when seen a few days later to discuss the results. The procedures were carried out in a well-staffed Day Case Unit with a recovery area. The mean dose of midazolam used was 10 · 8 mg (mean ± sd= 0 · 16 ± 0 · 095 mg kg− 1). The midazolam was given over a median of 4 min (range 1 – 15 min). Patients took 59 ± 45 min (mean ± sd) to wake up. Twenty-eight patients were given flumazanil to reverse the sedation (11 for concern over bleeding following biopsies, three for desaturation during and three after procedure, four as they were frail, two as they were restless, two as they were hypotensive after procedure and three for miscellaneous reasons). Only nine patients could remember any part of the procedure. Incremental doses of midazolam given slowly <b>until</b> patients are <b>lightly</b> asleep almost invariably produce complete amnesia for bronchoscopy. This is a safe technique but patients need careful monitoring and may require reversal of sedation with flumazanil...|$|R
40|$|Tasmanian {{woodlands}} {{range from}} the coast to the climatic treeline, {{from some of the}} poorest soils in the world to some of the richest, from waterlogged ground to sharply drained dry ridges. They are unusual in temperate Australia in that they support a full complement of native marsupial herbivores, which can occur in high densities. This chapter covers the subset of these woodlands with understoreys potentially dominated by native grasses and herbs, henceforth called grassy woodlands. These grassy woodlands have been dramatically reduced and degraded in Tasmania (Kirkpatrick et al. 1988), but still cover large areas of private land, largely utilised for wool production (Kirkpatrick et al. 2007) (see map below). They also occur on some smaller areas of public land, largely utilised for recreation and nature conservation. The remaining areas of grassy woodland on both types of tenure are under severe threat as the State Government embarks upon a misguided program to turn the dry Midlands of Tasmania into an irrigated food bowl. One key to the conservation of those grassy woodlands that are fortunate enough to survive lies in a middle path, avoiding both the thinning and thickening of trees. The other key lies in preventing a native grass and herb-dominated understorey from losing significant species or transforming into heath, scrub or vegetation dominated by exotic plants. The prevention of the last of these transitions relates to land-use decisions, and therefore to the economic, social and political context. The other transitions involve ecological interactions between climate, soils, fire regimes and grazing regimes. While climate change cannot be altered in the short term, fire and grazing regimes, two of the most effective vegetation management tools, are fortunately more malleable. The task given for this chapter was to report the conservation implications of ecological and social studies of Tasmanian grassy woodland in which I have been involved. Particular reference is made to the role of vegetation remnants in conservation and the impacts of recent climate change. 1. To help prevent trees from dying out, exclude or kill Common Brushtail Possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) (Tasmania only). 2. To help prevent trees from dying out, destock or stock <b>lightly</b> <b>until</b> a new generation establishes. 3. Burning can help prevent trees from dying out in the short term. 4. Both burning and grazing are necessary to prevent native tree and shrub thickening. 5. Vertebrate grazers can be used to control some species of woody weeds. 6. Mowing or slashing can be used to prevent tree and shrub thickening. 7. To maintain significant species, keep on doing what has been done until you prove that it is better to do otherwise. 8. Old, small, isolated remnants with high perimeter: area ratios can be very important for nature conservation. Corridors may not be particularly important. 9. Latitude and high relative relief make most of the Tasmanian grassy woodland biota resilient to climate change. 10. Regulation combined with stewardship payments seems to {{be the only way to}} stop more clearance and fertilisation of grassy woodlands. 11. People with local ecological expertise and experience can usually provide good management advice, whereas tool kits and models cannot cope with contingencies. ...|$|R
