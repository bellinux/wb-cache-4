In 1852, he attempted to dam the Kilmory River, half a mile north of Loch Sgathaig, the plan being to send the overflow into the Kinloch River via a short canal; unfortunately Salisbury's Dam collapsed shortly after being built.|$|E

Grant presented his plan to Henry Halleck, his new commander under the newly created Department of Missouri. Halleck was considering the same strategy, but rebuffed Grant, believing he needed twice the number of troops. However, after Halleck telegraphed and consulted McClellan about the plan, he finally agreed on condition that the attack be conducted in close cooperation with navy Flag Officer, Andrew H. Foote. After Foote's gunboats had silenced most of the guns at the fort, Grant's troops moved in and easily captured Fort Henry on February 6, 1862.|$|E

5|$|Reflecting the {{tendency}} in the Third Reich to have several rival agencies {{operating in the}} same field, {{a number of new}} organizations emerged in the diplomatic field that competed with the Auswärtiges Amt. The most important of the rivals of the Auswärtiges Amt was the Dienststelle Ribbentrop, which was the rival foreign office headed by Joachim von Ribbentrop that operated its own foreign policy in direct competition with the Auswärtiges Amt. Neurath favored a pro-Chinese policy whereas Ribbentrop favored a pro-Japanese policy. In the summer of 1935, Ribbentrop and his friend, the Japanese military attache to Germany General Hiroshi Ōshima, came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> square the circle between Germany having to choose between Japan or China, and bring China into the Japanese sphere of influence by devising a plan for anti-Communist alliance that would unite Germany, China and Japan together. This was the origin of what become the Anti-Comintern Pact, but the Ribbentrop-Ōshima plan was vetoed in November 1935 jointly by the Foreign Minister Konstantin von Neurath and by the War Minister Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg , who told Hitler that the Chinese would never join this proposed alliance, and that on economic grounds China had much more to offer Germany than did Japan.|$|E
5|$|The American and the Queen is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on Maud, the fictional queen of Rumania, who is overthrown by her cousin, Rupert. Maud is thrown into prison after refusing the romantic advances of Rupert. She escapes {{with the aid of}} her lady-in-waiting and a priest. A wealthy American named Jack Walton, foils an assassination attempt on Maud and he falls in love with her. Maud is recaptured and set to be executed when the priest comes <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> save her, by marrying Jack and Maud. The ceremony takes place through her cell window, and soon the United States military arrives to save the now wife of an American. Rupert is killed in the ensuing conflict. No known cast or production credits for the film is known. The film was released on November 11, 1910 and was met with neutral to negative reviews by critics. The patriotic element of the film was cited as likely being comical for European audiences and the film was also used as an example of an inappropriate example of American flag-waving. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

The Australian-led unit included eight U.S. Special Forces and 173 South Vietnamese and Nùng CIDG soldiers, and they were joined by 33 U.S. Marines on 4 May. Since their arrival, White and his men had set up camp on top of the hill feature in Ngok Tavak.
