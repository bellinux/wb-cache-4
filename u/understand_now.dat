2500|$|In 1997, the European Parliament, {{of which}} Le Pen {{was then a}} member, removed his {{parliamentary}} immunity so that Le Pen could be tried by a German court for comments he made at a December 1996 press conference before the German Republikaner party. Echoing his 1987 remarks in France, Le Pen stated: [...] "If you take a 1,000-page book on World War II, the concentration camps take up only two pages and the gas chambers 10 to 15 lines. This is what one calls a detail." [...] In June 1999, a Munich court found this statement to be [...] "minimizing the Holocaust, which caused the deaths of six million Jews," [...] and convicted and fined Le Pen for his remarks. Le Pen retorted ironically: [...] "I <b>understand</b> <b>now</b> that it's the Second World War which is a detail {{of the history of}} the gas chambers." ...|$|E

60|$|I <b>understood</b> <b>now</b> {{the poor}} woman's whispered allusion to Judas.|$|R
60|$|Sarah <b>understood</b> <b>now,</b> {{and at once}} {{entered into}} it with all her heart.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Direck, too, <b>understood</b> <b>now</b> that he could, {{and they}} went off holding hands rather after the fashion of two skaters.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>understand.</b> <b>Now,</b> Mr. Trelawney Hope, I {{should be}} much obliged {{if you would}} tell me exactly the {{circumstances}} under which this document disappeared." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{seemed to}} <b>understand</b> <b>now,</b> and she protested: [...] "But I don't mean dreams. I mean {{things that really}} happened, or that really will happen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bless you, dearest of Dianas, I <b>understand</b> <b>now.</b> What is an {{imagination}} for if not {{to enable}} you to peep at life through other people's eyes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "God help me!" [...] he said. For the thorns {{were similar}} to those the Dyaks poison and use in their blowing-tubes. He <b>understood</b> <b>now</b> what Chang-hi's {{assurance}} of the safety of his treasure meant. He <b>understood</b> that grin <b>now.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "And he's a {{very good}} man," [...] said Cynthia, who <b>understood</b> <b>now</b> that he had spoken a little lightly of Jethro, and resented it.|$|R
6000|$|She <b>understood</b> <b>now</b> {{the final}} {{warnings}} uttered by her friends. [...] "You will find everything changed," [...] they had said, [...] "because you are changed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you <b>understand</b> <b>now,</b> O Prince," [...] she said, [...] "why {{a million}} warriors guard {{the domains of}} the Holy Therns by day and by night?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose so. But I wish to {{make you}} <b>understand,</b> <b>now</b> that I am going to England, and may {{possibly}} never return to these shores again--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{you are too}} refined for me. But can you not <b>understand,</b> <b>now,</b> {{the causes}} of my sympathy even with Windrush and his 'spirit of truth'?" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{began to}} cry. Philip <b>understood</b> <b>now</b> {{why she had}} not been in to luncheon and why she wore a black dress. She could not speak.|$|R
60|$|Skip {{literally}} groveled on {{the ground}} in his fear. He <b>understood</b> <b>now</b> that his share in that business had not been known until he himself betrayed the fact.|$|R
60|$|And {{with the}} silence came thought, and {{a blaze of}} {{understanding}} that flashed upon her and made all things clear. She <b>understood</b> <b>now</b> why she had closed her ears.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{could not}} understand. I do not <b>understand</b> <b>now.</b> Just before {{that they were}} going to kill me as a Boer spy. Who told you everything?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, she is; and I <b>understand</b> <b>now,</b> Harry, {{that her}} alarm was an accident. I {{beg your pardon}} for {{thinking}} {{for a moment that}} it was otherwise--" ...|$|E
60|$|Deane rose to {{his feet}} with a little stifled cry. He seemed to <b>understand</b> <b>now</b> how men who were left alone with their {{thoughts}} might find madness.|$|E
6000|$|She <b>understood</b> <b>now</b> why he {{had said}} downstairs, when she had glanced at a big {{photographic}} enlargement of a portrait of Doctor Barnardo, [...] "your favourite hero in real life." ...|$|R
6000|$|Sir Hugo {{watched him}} silently {{for a few}} moments, {{thinking}} he <b>understood</b> <b>now</b> why the lad had seemed angry {{at the notion of}} becoming a singer. Then he said tenderly-- ...|$|R
60|$|Agravaine was {{conscious}} of a dull, heavy weight pressing on his heart. He had known his love was hopeless, but even hopelessness is the better for being indefinite. He <b>understood</b> <b>now.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I <b>understand</b> <b>now,</b> Baas. A man may be rich {{in things}} he loves and yet does not want, {{which makes him}} poor in other ways." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, they're not," [...] {{declared}} Old Mr. Toad. [...] "How any one can mistake {{my babies}} for their cousins I cannot <b>understand.</b> <b>Now</b> mine are beautiful, while--" ...|$|E
60|$|Upon this Mr. Woodcourt wished Mr. Vholes {{good day}} {{and went in}} search of Richard, the change in whose {{appearance}} he began to <b>understand</b> <b>now</b> but too well.|$|E
60|$|John <b>understood</b> <b>now</b> {{that this}} was only her way of being glad, so he just patted her {{shoulder}} and got her a chair, {{and waited for her}} to dry her eyes.|$|R
6000|$|His heart gave {{a sudden}} bound. He <b>understood</b> <b>now.</b> The demon butler {{had had his}} wicked way. Good heavens! She had thought he was taunting her! He must explain at once. He-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Bamtz let out {{a sickly}} snigger. The Frenchman alone got up to make a bow to Davidson’s {{careless}} nod. His stumps were stuck immovably in his pockets. Davidson <b>understood</b> <b>now</b> the reason.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you, Mr Mifflin.' There was a {{break in}} her laugh. 'I don't {{think there is any}} necessity. I think I <b>understand</b> <b>now.</b> It was very clever of you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>understand</b> <b>now,</b> Roland, {{and quite}} {{agree with you}} as to your course. I am very glad that you have told me, for before, I could not make you out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There'll {{have to be}} a change," [...] he said. [...] "Dick's {{accounts}} {{have given}} me something to think about. I believe I'm beginning to <b>understand</b> <b>now</b> how his money went." ...|$|E
60|$|That is, fear of {{the fire}} had made her sign a paper whose {{contents}} she had not understood then, but <b>understood</b> <b>now</b> by revelation of her Voices and by testimony of her persecutors.|$|R
60|$|The others <b>understood</b> <b>now.</b> After a Muckley {{there was}} always a great dearth of pence, and a moneyed man could become owner of Muckley {{purchases}} at a sixth part of the Muckley price.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the name}} [...] "Rubinroth" [...] Barney started. It was his mother's name. Suddenly the truth flashed upon him. He <b>understood</b> <b>now</b> the reticence of both {{his father and}} mother {{relative}} to her early life.|$|R
