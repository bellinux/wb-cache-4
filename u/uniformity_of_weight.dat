METHODS: Four batches of Restyl ® (branded) and Tranax ® (branded- generic) containing Alprazolam, 0. 25 mg, manufactured by Cipla, were selected for carrying out the proposed study. The test samples were tested for assay, hardness, <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> and disintegration time, as per official methods. RESULTS: The average assay values obtained after analysis of these four different batches of RESTYL TABLETS using HPLC method was 0. 2535 mg per tablet against the claim of 0. 25 mg while it was 0. 233 mg for TRANAX TABLETS.

Methods: The quality and physicochemical equivalence of seven different brands of chloroquine phosphate tablets were assessed. The assessment included the evaluation of <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight,</b> friability, crushing strength, disintegration and dissolution tests as well as chemical assay of the tablets. Results: All the seven brands of the tablets passed the British Pharmacopoeia (BP) standards for <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight,</b> disintegration and crushing strength.

When log-transformed body weights were used to account for a scale effect, the use of HH instead of AA produced a small and non-significant increase (1. 3 to 13. 9 %) in predictive ability. The sire-dam DHGLM had lower predictive ability for uniformity compared to the animal DHGLM.

40|$|Background: Animal {{breeding}} {{programs have}} been very successful in improving the mean levels of traits through selection. However, in recent decades, reducing the variability of trait levels between individuals has become a highly desirable objective. Reaching this objective through genetic selection requires that there is genetic variation in the variability of trait levels, a phenomenon known as genetic heterogeneity of environmental (residual) variance. The aim of our {{study was to investigate}} the potential for genetic improvement <b>of</b> <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> harvest <b>weight</b> and body size traits (length, depth, and width) in the genetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT) strain. In order to quantify the genetic variation in <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> traits and estimate the genetic correlations between level and variance of the traits, double hierarchical generalized linear models were applied to individual trait values. Results: Our results showed substantial genetic variation in <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> all analyzed traits, with genetic coefficients of variation for residual variance ranging from 39 to 58 %. Genetic correlation between trait level and variance was strongly positive for harvest weight (0. 60 ± 0. 09), moderate and positive for body depth (0. 37 ± 0. 13), but not significantly different from 0 for body length and width. Conclusions: Our results on the genetic variation in <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> harvest <b>weight</b> and body size traits show good prospects for the genetic improvement <b>of</b> <b>uniformity</b> in the GIFT strain. A high and positive genetic correlation was estimated between level and variance <b>of</b> harvest <b>weight,</b> which suggests that selection for heavier fish will also result in more variation in harvest <b>weight.</b> Simultaneous improvement <b>of</b> harvest <b>weight</b> and its uniformity will thus require index selection. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{aviation}} {{industry in the}} African region, in order {{to compete with the}} global market, is exploring and actively pursing expansion either through strategic alliances or by adopting the hub and spoke (H&S) network development. Hubbing has the major benefits of consolidating passengers, thus increasing frequency of travel while increasing accessibility and improving the economies of scale to operate the service. The African region is vast and is characterised by sparse passenger demand; therefore, the decisions made in locating airports as hubs pose a challenge. This paper aims to explore the use of the multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) tools as a method of choosing hub airports. The reason why the MCDA tools are most appropriate is because choosing a hub airport is a complex decision which has to take into account various issues like: network costs, infrastructure costs, security, economic viability, safety, passenger travel time expenditure, etc. The various tools, processes and methodologies used in decision making theory are explored and applied in order to choose hub airports with the lowest transport costs in an efficient H&S network. The major findings in this study show that because Africa has a sparse network, with a few role players, the choice in hub location options relies greatly on the cost of routing passengers through the hub airport. MCDA is shown to be a useful tool whose only limitation is maintaining the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> <b>weighting</b> the criteria for the whole region...|$|R
