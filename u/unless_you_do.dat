500|$|Six {{years after}} {{cancellation}} of Police Squad!, the film [...] returned Nielsen to {{his role as}} Frank Drebin. It involved a ruthless drug king trying hypnosis to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II. Nielsen did many of his own stunts: [...] "You {{have an idea of}} how you're going to do something, and it's your vision... <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it, it really doesn't stand a chance." [...] This movie grossed over $78million and was well received by critics. Ebert's 3½–star review (out of four) noted, [...] "You laugh, and then you laugh at yourself for laughing." ...|$|E
500|$|At 08:00 on {{the morning}} of 27 August, after a {{messenger}} sent by Khalid requested parley from Cave, the consul replied that he would only have salvation if he agreed to the terms of the ultimatum. At 08:30 a further messenger from Khalid declared that [...] "We have no intention of hauling down our flag and we do not believe you would open fire on us"; Cave replied that [...] "We do not want to open fire, but <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> as you are told we shall certainly do so." [...] At 08:55, having received no further word from the palace, aboard St George Rawson hoisted the signal [...] "prepare for action".|$|E
2500|$|Criticism {{was placed}} on the new disc loader, stating: [...] "The cover can be moved by hand if you wish, there's also an eject button to do the work for you, but there is no {{software}} eject from the triangle button menus in the Xross Media Bar (XMB) interface. In addition, you have to close the cover by hand, which can be a bit fiddly if it's upright, and the PS3 won't start reading a disc <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> [...]" [...] They also said there is no real drop in retail price.|$|E

25|$|After {{the combat}} phase {{there is another}} main phase. The second main phase is {{identical}} to the first, except you can not put down land <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not in your first main phase.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{were all}} down below. I had to rest a little. When I {{came up the}} {{watchman}} was asleep. He swears he wasn't, but I know better. Nobody heard any noise, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> But perhaps <b>you</b> were asleep?" [...] he asked, deferentially.|$|R
2500|$|Branson {{started his}} record {{business}} {{from the church}} where he ran Student magazine. He interviewed several prominent personalities of the late 1960s for the magazine including Mick Jagger and R. D. Laing. Branson advertised popular records in Student, {{and it was an}} overnight success. Trading under the name [...] "Virgin", he sold records for considerably less than the [...] "High Street" [...] outlets, especially the chain W. H. Smith. Branson once said, [...] "There is no point in starting your own business <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it {{out of a sense of}} frustration." [...] The name [...] "Virgin" [...] was suggested by one of Branson's early employees because they were all new at business. At the time, many products were sold under restrictive marketing agreements that limited discounting, despite efforts in the 1950s and 1960s to limit so-called resale price maintenance.|$|E

"You {{may tell}} him," [...] Archie said quietly, [...] "that {{you are no}} willing messenger; for that I told <b>you</b> that <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> my errand your house should, before morning, be a heap of smoking ashes. I have a {{following}} hard by, and will keep my word." ...|$|R

I can't believe it! Of all the things I loathe most, a practical joker is the worst. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> mean to tell me <b>you</b> <b>did</b> all this as a practical joke?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That I {{have thought}} of," [...] the officer said, [...] "and have brought with me some dye which will darken your skin. It {{would be worse}} than useless for you to dress as a Burman, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> so; for it would seem even more singular, {{to the people in}} the streets, that a white man should be seen walking about dressed as an officer, than that a white {{prisoner}} should be taken through the streets under a guard.|$|R

"And, now I {{think of}} it," [...] {{continued}} Jack, [...] "it {{seems to me}} that the surest way of arranging your tank so as to get it to keep pure and in good condition will be to imitate the ocean in it; in fact, make it a miniature Pacific.
