5|$|Charles Brooke {{encouraged}} the immigration of the Chinese coolies, {{beginning in the}} 1860s, to expand the state's gambier and pepper industry.

5|$|Dick Harp was in {{the midst}} of his first season as head coach of the Kansas Jayhawks as the team entered the National Championship game.

At the beginning of the season, the Jayhawks starting line up consisted of Seniors Gene Elstun, Maurice King, John Parker, Lew Johnson, and Sophomore Chamberlain. Ron Loneski replaced Johnson's spot in the starting line <b>up</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> season. Harp began the season with a man to man defense, but later switched to a zone in order to give them an advantage in rebounding the basketball.|$|E
