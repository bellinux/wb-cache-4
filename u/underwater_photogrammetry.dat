40|$|<b>Underwater</b> <b>photogrammetry</b> using {{consumer}} grade {{photographic equipment}} can be feasible for different applications, e. g. archaeology, biology, industrial inspections, etc. The {{use of a}} camera underwater can {{be very different from}} its terrestrial use due to the optical phenomena involved. The presence of the water and camera pressure housing {{in front of the camera}} act as additional optical elements. Spherical dome ports are difficult to manufacture and consequently expensive but at the same time they are the most useful for <b>underwater</b> <b>photogrammetry</b> as they keep the main geometric characteristics of the lens unchanged. Nevertheless, the manufacturing and alignment of dome port pressure housing components can be the source of unexpected changes of radial and decentering distortion, source of systematic errors that can influence the final 3 D measurements. The paper provides a brief introduction of underwater optical phenomena involved in underwater photography, then presents the main differences between flat and dome ports to finally discuss the effect of manufacturing on 3 D measurements in two case studies...|$|E

40|$|The {{critically}} endangered grey {{nurse shark}} (Carcharias taurus) off eastern Australia {{is the focus}} of a non-consumptive, economically important marine wildlife tourism (MWT) industry centred on scuba diving with the sharks. This industry has been identified as a potential threat to the continued survival and recovery of the species. Legislative guidelines and a national code of conduct for scuba diver behaviour were developed to mitigate adverse impacts of MWT on the sharks. This research assessed the putative impacts of scuba diving MWT on grey nurse shark behaviour and the efficacy of management strategies across differing life-history stages and aggregation sites. <b>Underwater</b> stereo-video <b>photogrammetry</b> was used to develop a partial ethogram of the swimming and non-swimming behaviours of grey nurse sharks at locations within aggregation sites during daylight hours without MWT. Predominantly low-energy behaviours were exhibited and no threatening agonistic behaviours were observed. Underwater visual census also documented primarily low-activity swimming behaviours in sharks during interactions with MWT scuba divers of varying demographics and revealed absolute diver compliance with management guidelines. Passive acoustic telemetry showed sharks may have exhibited more active swimming when patrolling between two locations within a site but adopted low-energy swimming behaviours {{for the majority of the}} time during daylight hours regardless of scuba diving MWT. Sharks at differing life-history stages probably conserved energy at aggregation sites in association with their migratory movements and reproductive cycles. Differences in the swimming and patrolling behaviours of sharks were attributed to natural variation in environmental conditions (i. e. topography and currents) at the sites as they were not consistent with scuba diving MWT activity. This research strongly suggested that management strategies are effective at protecting the east Australian population of grey nurse sharks from MWT disturbance. Consequently, the grey nurse shark scuba diving MWT industry in its current form is ecologically and economically sustainable...|$|R
30|$|For {{applications}} {{other than}} PIV, such as <b>underwater</b> photography and <b>photogrammetry,</b> several models and calibration techniques {{have been proposed}} to explicitly correct for the distortion due to a change of refractive media. Kwon proposed a modification of the direct linear transform (DLT) model using Snell’s law to explicitly correct for this [7, 8]. Simulations using this model showed a significantly smaller error than the DLT model. However, his calibration method required the prior knowledge of the location and orientation of the planar interface. Treibitz et al. show that a camera viewing a scene through multiple refractive geometry {{is not a single}} viewpoint system [9]. They proposed a camera calibration method for estimating the focal length of the camera and the distance from the camera center to the interface based on minimizing the length in the world space of a known straight object. Agrawal et al. further extended this area, showing the system is essentially an axial camera [10]. They proposed a calibration method based on 2 D- 3 D point correspondences where the 3 D calibration points have an unknown pose. The calibration scheme allows them to estimate the orientation of the camera with respect to the interfaces, the thicknesses of the interfaces, and the indices of refraction.|$|R

40|$|Photogrammetry {{has often}} been the most {{preferable}} method for the geometric documentation of monuments, especially in cases of highly complex objects, of high accuracy and quality requirements and, of course, budget, time or accessibility limitations. Such limitations, requirements and complexities are undoubtedly features of the highly challenging task of surveying an underwater archaeological site. This paper {{is focused on the}} case of a Hellenistic shipwreck found in Greece at the Southern Euboean gulf, 40 - 47 meters below the sea surface. <b>Underwater</b> <b>photogrammetry</b> was chosen as the ideal solution for the detailed and accurate mapping of a shipwreck located in an environment with limited accessibility. There are time limitations when diving at these depths so it is essential that the data collection time is kept as short as possible. This makes custom surveying techniques rather impossible to apply. However, with the growing use of consumer cameras and photogrammetric software, this application is becoming easier, thus benefiting a wide variety of underwater sites. Utilizing cameras for <b>underwater</b> <b>photogrammetry</b> though, poses some crucial modeling problems, due to the refraction effect and further additional parameters which have to be co-estimated [1]. The applied method involved an underwater calibration of the camera as well as conventional field survey measurements in order to establish a reference frame. The application of a three-dimensional trilateration using common tape measures was chosen for this reason. Among the software that was used for surveying and photogrammetry processing, were Site Recorder SE, Eos Systems Photomodeler, ZI’s SSK and Rhinoceros. The underwater archaeological research at the Southern Euboean gulf is a continuing project carried out by the Hellenic Institute for Marine Archaeology (H. I. M. A.) in collaboration with the Greek Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities, {{under the direction of the}} archaeologist G. Koutsouflakis. The geometric documentation of the shipwreck was the result of the collaboration between H. I. M. A. and the National Technical University of Athens...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of <b>underwater</b> <b>photogrammetry</b> allows to realize 3 D models of submerged object and structures throughout {{the use of}} rapid and efficient procedures either in terms of data acquisition and data processing. These procedures are based on solutions that are applied using natural control points, signalized markers and tie points; the most common algorithms are based on Structure from Motion (SfM) approach. The limit of these applications is sometimes due to the final accuracy, especially when the goal is a centimeter level of accuracy. This accuracy should be necessary when dealing with a survey devoted to deformation control purposes. An example is the <b>underwater</b> <b>photogrammetry</b> for the determination of coral growth; it is effectively a movement or a deformation detection issue where the geometric change is almost at centimeter or few centimeters accuracy level. When dealing with deformation control applications, a geodetic network is essential to realize a stable and unambiguous reference frame through the accurate and permanent installation of Ground Control Points (GCPs). Such a network, indeed, permits a robust reference frame for the georeferencing of images blocks in the different époques of data acquisition. Therefore, the comparison among subsequent photogrammetric restitutions is based on homogeneous 3 D models that have been oriented in the same absolute reference system. The photogrammetric survey {{is based on a}} methodological approach especially adapted to underwater biometry (like coral growth determination) and to underwater archaeology. The approach is suitable both for modeling objects of relatively reduced dimensions and for structures with a length of ten meters or more, such as coral barriers, wrecks and long walls. The paper describes underwater photogrammetric surveys on sites at different extensions, the geodetic GCPs reference network installation and measurements (distance and elevation difference observations) as well as preliminary results of the network adjustment. A brief description of image acquisition at a different scales and the resulting 3 D model of first campaign are also shown...|$|E
40|$|Underwater survey, {{compared}} to land archaeology, needs some specific techniques, because {{the application of}} some active 3 D sensor, such as laser scanner, is obviously impossible. The necessity to produce three-dimensional survey, offering the same accuracy of classical terrestrial laserscanning or photogrammetric methods, combined with the request of low costs and rapid solutions, led the researchers to test and apply oftentimes image-based techniques. In {{the last two years}} the Ca' Foscari University and University IUAV of Venice are conducting a research on the application of integrated techniques to support underwater metric documentation, comparing them to the manual traditional one. The gained experience (and confirmed by other recently published papers) shows that the actual multiimage digital photogrammetry is a good solution for the underwater archaeology. This approach is useful both from a metric and from a recording point of view, because it achieves high quality results, such as accurate 3 D models or 2 D representations, offering a complete documentation of <b>underwater</b> sites. But <b>photogrammetry</b> has to be supported by a topographical survey (to acquire ground control points - GCP) to georeference all the finds in the same reference system. This paper presents the integrated survey of two roman shipwrecks, approaching differently in the GCP’s acquisition just for the different morphological characteristic of the sites. The wrecks’ cargos are huge marble blocks, presenting differences in quantities, layout and depths. Those characteristics determine the choice of the topographic survey. The results of the survey are two 3 D polygonal textured models of the sites, which can be easily used for different analyses and reconstructive hypothesis, opening new possibilities of documentation with both specialists and the wider public. Furthermore, 3 D models are the geometric base for 2 D orthophoto and cross section extraction. The paper will illustrate all the phases regarding the survey’s design, acquisition and realization and the data processing to obtain 2 D and 3 D final representation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Coral reefs play a {{key role}} in coastal {{protection}} and habitat provision. They are also well known for their recreational value. Attempts to protect these ecosystems have not successfully stopped large-scale degradation. Significant efforts have been made by government and research organizations to ensure that coral reefs are monitored systematically to gain a deeper understanding of the causes, the effects and the extent of threats affecting coral reefs. However, further research is needed to fully understand the importance that sampling design has on coral reef characterization and assessment. This study examines the effect that sampling design has on the estimation of seascape metrics when coupling semi-autonomous <b>underwater</b> vehicles, structure-from-motion <b>photogrammetry</b> techniques and high resolution (0. 4 cm) underwater imagery. For this purpose, we use FRAGSTATS v 4 to estimate key seascape metrics that enable quantification of the area, density, edge, shape, contagion, interspersion and diversity of sessile organisms for a range of sampling scales (0. 5 m × 0. 5 m, 2 m × 2 m, 5 m × 5 m, 7 m × 7 m), quadrat densities (from 1 – 100 quadrats) and sampling strategies (nested vs. random) within a 1655 m 2 case study area in Ponta do Ouro Partial Marine Reserve (Mozambique). Results show that the benthic community is rather disaggregated within a rocky matrix; the embedded patches frequently have a small size and a regular shape; and the population is highly represented by soft corals. The genus Acropora is the more frequent and shows bigger colonies in the group of hard corals. Each of the seascape metrics has specific requirements of the sampling scale and quadrat density for robust estimation. Overall, the majority of the metrics were accurately identified by sampling scales equal to or coarser than 5 m × 5 m and quadrat densities equal to or larger than 30. The study indicates that special attention needs to be dedicated to the design of coral reef monitoring programmes, with decisions being based on the seascape metrics and statistics being determined. The results presented here are representative of the eastern South Africa coral reefs and are expected to be transferable to coral reefs with similar characteristics. The work presented here is limited to one study site and further research is required to confirm the findings...|$|R
40|$|<b>Underwater</b> <b>photogrammetry</b> and in {{particular}} systematic visual surveys of the deep sea are by far less developed than similar techniques on land or in space. The main challenges are the rough conditions with extremely high pressure, the accessibility of target areas (container and ship deployment of robust sensors, then diving for hours to the ocean floor), and the limitations of localization technologies (no GPS). The absence of natural light complicates energy budget considerations for deep diving flash-equipped drones. Refraction effects influence geometric image formation considerations with respect to field of view and focus, while attenuation and scattering degrade the radiometric image quality and limit the effective visibility. As an improvement on the stated issues, we present an AUV-based optical system intended for autonomous visual mapping of {{large areas of the}} seafloor (square kilometers) in up to 6000 m water depth. We compare it to existing systems and discuss tradeoffs such as resolution vs. mapped area and show results from a recent deployment with 90, 000 mapped square meters of deep ocean floor...|$|E
40|$|<b>Underwater</b> <b>photogrammetry,</b> {{like its}} {{counterpart}} in 'air', has gained an increasing diffusion {{thanks to the}} availability of easy-to-use, fast and often quite inexpensive software applications. Moreover, underwater equipment that allows the use of digital cameras normally designed to work in air also in water are largely available. However, for assuring accurate and reliable 3 D modelling results a profound knowledge of the employed devices {{as well as physical}} and geometric principle is even more crucial than in air. This study aims to take a step forward in understanding the effect of underwater ports in front of the photographic lens. In particular, the effect of dome or flat ports on image quality in 3 D modelling applications is investigated. Experiments conducted in a semi submerged indust rial structure show that the tested flat port performs worse than the dome, providing higher image residuals and lower precision and accuracy in object space. A significant different quality per colour channel is also observed and its influence on achievable processing results is discussed...|$|E

The project is financed together by the French Region PACA and the COMEX firm, specialized in underwater exploration. In this paper we present {{the first step}} experimentation on and underwater archaeological site in Corsica managed by the DRASSM and excavated under the scientific responsibility of Franca Cibecchini. After a brief archaeological presentation of the site we'll start by a description of the photogrammetric survey phase, made during the excavation, in the same time that a traditional manual survey make thanks to the shallowness site aspect. The first step is an orthophoto production. Buoys and scale bar are present on the site in order to permit orientation an model scale. If the orthophoto produced can't replace completely the manual survey made in situe, (this kind of survey is, in the same time, an archaeological interpretation made by the expert in the best situation of observation) the archaeologist can have a lot of benefit using this kind of representation. The orthophoto is a photogrammetric product, easy to obtain once the photogrammetric orientation is done and considering a more or less plane seabed, enough accurate for a first site representation. Moreover, due to the small scale photograph the orthophoto generation carry out a lot of very interesting huge quantities of qualitative detail. Then we will present the way to use this site representation as an interface to the database, managing all the site archaeological data, from the artefact representation and localization to the bibliography and iconography linked. The two dimension of this stratigraphy approach allowed us the use of traditional and free GIS software as GeoTools and SVG GIS package. For each step of the excavation, referring to a different deepness of the same site, we can produce a 2 D representation used as a database interface. The next step presented here, yet under development, is the data management in term of coherence, abstract theoretical model and data fusion. The artefact are carried out of the seabed and then analysed in laboratory month after the excavation process. So we have for each object, several information coming from different medium, for example <b>underwater</b> <b>photogrammetry</b> and direct observation in laboratory, we have to develop a strategy to merge these different data often obtained from different accuracy measure system.

40|$|Archaeological {{data are}} usually {{inherently}} incomplete, heterogeneous, discontinuous and require frequent updates and possible adjustments. It {{is important to}} constantly create detailed documentation, which will precisely represent the actual situation. However, even the most precise figure is only an estimated representation of the documented object. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} collect fully metric documentation and its professional archaeological interpretation. Acquiring correct and valuable underwaterdigital images for the archaeology purposes is not easy due to specific shooting conditions. It should be noted a number of limitations are unique to this type of imaging environment — the apparent extension of the focal length, the “disappearance” of colours, as well as a significant reduction in the transparency of the water environment. Therefore, the authors have made attempts to describe changes, in a much broader sense, in the quality of photogrammetric images that had been taken in various shooting conditions. Underwater and aerial images of two test fields were tested. First, the ground sampling distance of the INTOVA IC 500 digital camera and the geometric accuracy of the acquired images were examined. Then, the impact of changes to the imaging conditions on the radio-metric resolution and colour projection were designated. In the last stage, the acquired images were used in practice — to assess the progress of the erosion process of an archaeological object, and also to comply its documentation in the form of vector drawing with the accuracy of mxy = ± 0. 5 mm.

Two factors that can inﬂuence the measurement accuracy and precision of a stereo-video system are the cali-bration strategy and the physical orientation of the system. We compare the accuracy and precision of lengthmeasurements made by systems calibrated using two regularly used calibration approaches. We also comparelength measurements recorded from cameras with base separations of 150 mm, 400 mm, and 800 mm. Athree-dimensional (3 D), network calibration method using a purpose built calibration cube was used to deter-mine key calibration and camera orientation parameters (e. g., base separation, focal length, and lens distor-tions) with much improved precision in comparison to a two-dimensional method using either an A 3 or A 4 planar calibration pattern. As a result, measurements made with a 3 D cube displayed improved accuracy andprecision compared to either the A 3 or A 4 planar calibration pattern {{across a range of}} typical operational dis-tances. The distance between the cameras on the base bar (base separation) affects the accuracy and precisionof measurements with the 800 mm system producing length estimates of improved accuracy and precisionthan the systems with narrower baselines.

For this thesis proposes a stereo camera system unit was designed in order to extract three-dimensional data from digital images. This stereo system unit consists of two cameras, two camera housings and a stereo bar mounted on a pan/tilt unit.

The accuracy assessment covered three test sets operating three GoPro sports cameras of the same model (Hero 3 black).

However, their inshore occurrence also exposes them to anthropogenic impacts such as dolphin-watch tourism, which pose conservation challenges. In the Egyptian Red Sea, spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) frequently visit a small offshore reef, Samadai reef, to rest during the day. The site is a popular swim-with-dolphins destination, regulated by a management plan since 2004. To investigate the population ecology of spinner dolphins at Samadai reef and assess the effectiveness of the current management measures, a 4 -year study was undertaken between 2011 and 2014. Capture-recapture techniques applied to photo-identification data indicated a stable population of ~ 200 non-calf spinner dolphins, composed of long-term year-round residents of both sexes and transient individuals, with a high adult survival rate (0. 99; SE= 0. 02). The probability of temporary emigration was low (0. 15; SE= 0. 004), with females seemingly more philopatric than males. Photographic cross-matching with spinner dolphins seen in other resting areas indicates low-level interchange with neighbour reef-associated communities. Female spinner dolphins appear to reach sexual maturity at 8 - 10 years, typically having a 2 -year calving interval. The presence of tooth rake marks on females suggests coercive male sexual behaviour. There is one well-pronounced annual calving peak between June and August, which coincides with warmer water temperatures. Calf survival to 1 -year of age was generally high (0. 79; 95 %CI 0. 73 - 0. 87), but was significantly lower for calves born to younger females than older females (0. 61, 95 %CI 0. 43 - 0. 87 and 0. 80, 95 %CI 0. 71 - 0. 90, respectively). The crude birth rate (0. 10; SD= 0. 016), the annual recruitment rate (0. 08; SD= 0. 007) and the fecundity rate (0. 20; SD= 0. 018) indicate a healthy population. The Red Sea spinner dolphins showed pigmentation features apparently unique to the region. Adults were found to be sexually dimorphic. <b>Underwater</b> <b>photogrammetry</b> showed that female and male individual growth began to diverge at the length of ~ 151 cm, and that physical maturity was attained at the length of ~ 165 cm for females and ~ 180 cm for males, at approximately 7 and 10 years of age, respectively. The findings of this study confirmed the importance of Samadai reef as resting habitat for resident and transient spinner dolphins and indicated that the animals are not subject to obvious natural or anthropogenic stressors. The currently implemented management measures appear to be adequate and effective, although some modifications to the management practice are suggested. However, as long-term effects of human activities may take some time to emerge, further long-term monitoring and research is strongly recommended to ensure that expansion of tourism will not menace the viability of spinner dolphins at Samadai reef and more broadly in the Egyptian Red Sea. Resolution of apparent taxonomic uncertainties of the Red Sea spinner dolphins is recommended, as it is important in addressing conservation issues and informing management decisions at an appropriate geographic scale. published_or_final_versionBiological SciencesDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
