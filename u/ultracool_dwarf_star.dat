40|$|We discuss {{methods for}} {{classifying}} T dwarfs based on spectral morphological features and indices. T dwarfs are brown dwarfs which exhibit methane absorption bands at 1. 6 and 2. 2 μm. Spectra at red optical (6300 [...] 10100 Å) and near-infrared (1 [...] 2. 5 μm) wavelengths are presented, and differences between objects are noted and discussed. Spectral indices useful for classification schemes are presented. We conclude that near-infrared spectral classification is generally preferable for these cool objects, with data sufficient to resolve the 1. 17 and 1. 25 μm K I doublets lines being most valuable. Spectral features sensitive to gravity are discussed, with {{the strength of the}} K-band peak used as an example. Such features may be used to derive a two-dimensional scheme based on temperature and mass, in analogy to the MK temperature and luminosity classes.

40|$|As astronomers {{increasingly}} {{exploit the}} information available in the time domain, spectroscopic variability in particular opens broad new channels of investigation. Here we describe the selection algorithms for all targets intended for repeat spectroscopy in the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS), part of the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey within the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-IV. Also discussed are the scientific rationale and technical constraints leading to these target selections. The TDSS includes a large "Repeat Quasar Spectroscopy" (RQS) program delivering ~ 13, 000 repeat spectra of confirmed SDSS quasars, and several smaller "Few-Epoch Spectroscopy" (FES) programs targeting specific classes of quasars as well as stars. The RQS program aims to provide a large and diverse quasar data set for studying variations in quasar spectra on timescales of years, a comparison sample for the FES quasar programs, and opportunity for discovering rare, serendipitous events. The FES programs cover {{a wide variety of}} phenomena in both quasars and stars. Quasar FES programs target broad absorption line quasars, high signal-to-noise ratio normal broad line quasars, quasars with double-peaked or very asymmetric broad emission line profiles, binary supermassive black hole candidates, and the most photometrically variable quasars. Strongly variable stars are also targeted for repeat spectroscopy, encompassing many types of eclipsing binary systems, and classical pulsators like RR Lyrae. Other stellar FES programs allow spectroscopic variability studies of active <b>ultracool</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>stars,</b> <b>dwarf</b> carbon <b>stars,</b> and white dwarf/M dwarf spectroscopic binaries.

40|$|The Deep Lens Survey, a 20 deg 2 optical survey, {{was used}} to search for two types of rare, very red objects: faint high-redshift (z > 5. 4) quasars, which trace {{structure}} formation in the early Universe {{and can be used}} to study reionization; and <b>ultracool</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>stars</b> and brown <b>dwarfs,</b> the most numerous constituents of our own Galaxy, which are seldom detected beyond the solar neighborhood due to their low luminosities. To distinguish between these two populations, we added near-infrared imaging to a portion of the Deep Lens Survey area, covering 1. 12 deg 2 with survey J-band (1. 2 μm) imaging, and successfully targeting 181 out of a planned 280 very red targets over an additional 2. 4 deg 2. These observations were reduced and cataloged, producing colors or color limits for 1626 very red objects in the field. The colors were corrected using a combination of outside photometric standards and internal checks, and a model for the colors of the target populations was created from existing measurements in the literature. The relative classification probabilities were estimated for each object by using a color model, and those probabilities were used to generate Monte Carlo realizations of the populations, either for comparison to a simulated Galaxy (for <b>ultracool</b> <b>dwarfs)</b> or for the calculation of a luminosity function (for high-redshift QSOs). For QSOs, the results were consistent with the most recent work on faint QSOs: we measured a bright-end power-law slope of for the luminosity function. Citing the similarity to earlier results for brighter QSOs, we rule out QSOs as the dominant source of ionizing photons at the time of reionization (although they may have contributed at the 10 - 20 % level). For <b>ultracool</b> <b>dwarfs,</b> the model that best reproduced our measured magnitudes was a sech 2 vertical disk profile with for the earliest spectral type range (M 9 -L 2), with hints of a lower scale height for later spectral types. We integrate a range of best-fit models to predict the number of <b>ultracool</b> <b>dwarfs</b> to be found in future surveys, and estimate the errors introduced into current surveys by over-simplified models of the Galaxy. Spectroscopic observations were obtained for a few of our very red objects; these are displayed and analyzed. Although none of the targeted objects was definitively identified as a QSO, they showed interesting and unusual spectral features nonetheless. The methods demonstrated here for probabilistic classification of galactic and extragalactic objects will be essential to exploit the full potential of future wide deep surveys, such as LSST. These surveys will reach such faint objects that spectroscopy will be difficult or impossible for many years to come, yet we have shown that the imaging alone, augmented when necessary with follow-up photometry in specific bands, can provide the classifications needed to explore these unknown populations.

Our deep XMM-Newton observation has led to the first X-ray detection of DENIS-P J 1048 - 3956 (log Lx = 25. 1) as well as the first measurement of its V band brightness (V = 17. 35 mag). Flux-flux relations between X-ray and chromospheric activity indicators are {{here for the first time}} extended into the regime of the <b>ultracool</b> <b>dwarfs.</b> The approximate agreement of DENIS-P J 1048 - 3956 and other <b>ultracool</b> <b>dwarfs</b> with flux-flux relations for early-M dwarfs suggests that the same heating mechanisms work in the atmospheres of <b>ultracool</b> <b>dwarfs,</b> albeit weaker as judged from their lower fluxes. The observed Balmer decrements of DENIS-P J 1048 - 3956 are compatible with optically thick plasma in LTE at low, nearly photospheric temperature or optically thin LTE plasma at 20000 K. Describing the decrements with CaseB recombination requires different emitting regions for Halpha and the higher Balmer lines. The high observed Halpha/Hbeta flux ratio is also poorly fitted by the optically thin models. We derive a similarly high value for the Halpha/Hbeta ratio of vB 10 and LHS 2065 and conclude that this may be a characteristic of <b>ultracool</b> <b>dwarfs.</b> We add DENIS-P J 1048 - 3956 to the list of <b>ultracool</b> <b>dwarfs</b> detected in both the radio and the X-ray band.

40|$|Magnetic {{fields are}} {{prevalent}} {{in a wide}} variety of low mass stellar systems and play an important role in their evolution. Yet the process through which these fields are generated is not well understood. To understand how such systems can generate strong field structures characterization of these fields is required. Radio emission traces the fields directly and the properties of this emission can be modeled leading to constraints on the field geometry and magnetic parameters. The new Karl Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) provides highly sensitive radio observations. My thesis involves combining VLA observations with the development of magnetospheric emission models in order to characterize the magnetic fields in two fully convective cool star systems: (1) Young Stellar Objects (YSOs); (2) <b>Ultracool</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>stars.</b> I conducted multi epoch observations of DG Tau, a YSO with a highly active, collimated outflow. The radio emission observed from this source was found to be optically thick thermal emission with no indication of the magnetic activity observed in X-rays. I determined that the outflow is highly collimated very close to the central source, in agreement with jet launching models. Additionally, I constrained the mass loss of the ionized component of the jet and found that close to the central source the majority of mass is lost through this component. Using lower angular resolution observations, I detected shock formations in the extended jet of DG Tau and modeled their evolution with time. Taking full advantage of the upgraded bandwidth on the VLA, I made wideband observations of two UCDs, TVLM 513 - 46 and 2 M 0746 + 20. Combining these observations with previously published and archival VLA observations I was able to fully characterize the spectral and temporal properties of the radio emission. I found that the emission is dominated by a mildly polarized, non-thermal quiescent component with periodic strongly polarized flare emission. The spectral energy distribution and polarization of the quiescent emission is well modeled using gyrosynchrotron emission with a mean field B 100 G, mildly relativistic power-law electrons with a density ne 105 - 6 cm- 3, and source size of R 2 R*. We were able to model the pulsed emission by coherent electron cyclotron radiation from a small number of isolated loops of high magnetic field (2 - 3 kG) with scale heights 1. 2 - 2. 7 stellar radii. The loops are well-separated in magnetic longitude, and are not part of a single dipolar magnetosphere.

To explore whether <b>ultracool</b> <b>dwarfs</b> previously undetected at 8. 5 GHz may be detectable at a lower frequency. We select a sample of fast rotating <b>ultracool</b> <b>dwarfs</b> with no detectable radio activity at 8. 5 GHz, observing each of them at 4. 9 GHz. From the 8 dwarfs in our sample, we detect emission from 2 MASS J 07464256 + 2000321, with a mean flux level of 286 ± 24 μ Jy.

At 3. 91 ^+ 0. 42 _- 0. 46 kpc, it is the third consecutive case among the Spitzer "Galactic distribution" planets toward the Galactic bulge that lies in the Galactic disk {{as opposed to the}} bulge itself, hinting at a skewed distribution of planets. Together with previous microlensing discoveries, the seven Earth-size planets orbiting the <b>ultracool</b> <b>dwarf</b> TRAPPIST- 1, and the detection of disks around young brown dwarfs, OGLE- 2016 -BLG- 1195 Lb suggests that such planets might be common around <b>ultracool</b> <b>dwarfs.</b> It therefore sheds light on the formation of both <b>ultracool</b> <b>dwarfs</b> and planetary systems at the limit of low-mass protoplanetary disks.

40|$|The Canada-France Brown Dwarf Survey {{is a wide}} eld {{survey for}} cool brown dwarfs {{conducted}} with the MegaCam camera on the CFHT telescope. Our objectives are to nd <b>ultracool</b> brown <b>dwarfs</b> and to constrain the eld brown dwarf mass function from a large and homogeneous sample of L and T dwarfs. We identify candidates in CFHT/Megacam i' and z' images and follow them up with pointed NIR imaging on several telescopes. Our survey has to date found 50 T dwarfs candidates and 170 L or late M dwarf candidates drawn from a larger sample of 1300 candidates with typical <b>ultracool</b> <b>dwarfs</b> i'-z' colours, found in 900 square degrees. We currently have completed the NIR follow-up on {{a large part of}} the survey for all candidates from the latest T dwarfs known to the late L color range.

40|$|Three Earth-sized exoplanets were {{recently}} discovered {{close to the}} habitable zone of the nearby <b>ultracool</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>star</b> TRAPPIST- 1 (ref. 3). The nature of these planets {{has yet to be}} determined, as their masses remain unmeasured and no observational constraint is available for the planetary population surrounding ultracool dwarfs, of which the TRAPPIST- 1 planets are the first transiting example. Theoretical predictions span the entire atmospheric range, from depleted to extended hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. Here we report observations of the combined transmission spectrum of the two inner planets during their simultaneous transits on 4 May 2016. The lack of features in the combined spectrum rules out cloud-free hydrogen-dominated atmospheres for each planet at[*]≥ 10 σ levels; TRAPPIST- 1 b and c are therefore unlikely to have an extended gas envelope as they occupy a region of parameter space in which high-altitude cloud/haze formation is not expected to be significant for hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. Many denser atmospheres remain consistent with the featureless transmission spectrum—from a cloud-free water-vapour atmosphere to a Venus-like one. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Star-like {{objects with}} {{effective}} temperatures {{of less than}} 2, 700 [*]kelvin {{are referred to as}} ‘ultracool dwarfs’. This heterogeneous group includes stars of extremely low mass as well as brown dwarfs (substellar objects not massive enough to sustain hydrogen fusion), and represents about 15 per cent of the population of astronomical objects near the Sun. Core-accretion theory predicts that, given the small masses of these ultracool dwarfs, and the small sizes of their protoplanetary disks, there should be a large but hitherto undetected population of terrestrial planets orbiting them—ranging from metal-rich Mercury-sized planets to more hospitable volatile-rich Earth-sized planets. Here we report observations of three short-period Earth-sized planets transiting an <b>ultracool</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>star</b> only 12 parsecs away. The inner two planets receive four times and two times the irradiation of Earth, respectively, placing them close to the inner edge of the habitable zone of the star. Our data suggest that 11 orbits remain possible for the third planet, the most likely resulting in irradiation significantly less than that received by Earth. The infrared brightness of the host star, combined with its Jupiter-like size, offers the possibility of thoroughly characterizing the components of this nearby planetary system. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{discovery}} of the planetary system hosted by the <b>ultracool</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>star</b> TRAPPIST- 1 could open new perspectives into the investigation of planetary climates of Earth-sized exoplanets, their atmospheres and their possible habitability. In this paper, we use a simple climate-vegetation energy-balance model to study the climate of the seven TRAPPIST- 1 planets and the climate dependence on the global albedo, on the fraction of vegetation that could cover their surfaces and on the different greenhouse conditions. The model allows us to investigate whether liquid water could be maintained on the planetary surfaces (i. e., by defining a "surface water zone") in different planetary conditions, {{with or without the}} presence of greenhouse effect. It is shown that planet TRAPPIST- 1 d seems to be the most stable from an Earth-like perspective, since it resides in the surface water zone {{for a wide range of}} reasonable values of the model parameters. Moreover, according to the model outer planets (f, g and h) cannot host liquid water on their surfaces, even for Earth-like conditions, entering a snowball state. Although very simple, the model allows to extract the main features of the TRAPPIST- 1 planetary climates. Comment: 5 figures, accepted on The Astrophysical Journa...|$|E

Spectroscopic observations of 43 of the 57 <b>ultracool</b> <b>dwarfs</b> were previously reported in Martin et al. (2010).

We used late-M (�M 8. 0), L, and T dwarfs with accurate trigonometric parallaxes to calibrate the MJ versus I − J colour-luminosity relation. The resulting photometric distances have standard errors of ∼ 15 %, which we used to select candidates dphot � 30 pc. We measured proper motions from multi-epoch images found in public archives (ALADIN, DSS, 2 MASS, DENIS), with at least three distinct epochs and time baselines of 10 to 21 years.

40|$|<b>Ultracool</b> <b>dwarfs</b> are {{objects in}} the red and brown dwarf regimes with {{electrically}} neutral atmospheres caused by their cool temperatures.

This sample is composed of mostly null detections, along with a number of confirmed detections, and has both large uncertainties and intrinsic scatter.
