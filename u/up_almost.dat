5|$|The castle, and {{an outer}} {{enclosure}} of which little trace remains, originally took <b>up</b> <b>almost</b> {{the entire area}} of Castle Island. The present wooded, and considerably larger, island was formed in the early 19th century when the canalising of the outflow of the River Leven, which enters the Firth of Forth at the town of Leven, led to a substantial lowering of the water level.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{crest of}} Saurolophus is made <b>up</b> <b>almost</b> {{completely}} by the nasal bones, and in S. angustirostris it is solid. In adult specimens the crests are a rounded triangular shape in cross section. The crest protrudes past {{the edge of}} the skull backwards. Thin processes from the frontals and prefrontals extend along the underside of the crest, probably to strengthen it. At the end of the crest is a swelling of the nasal, which is often termed differently.|$|E
5|$|Violent crime from 2005 to 2006 {{was mostly}} {{unchanged}} nationwide, but {{increased more than}} 10% in Cleveland. The murder rate dropped 30% in Cleveland, but was still far above the national average. Property crime from 2005 to 2006 was virtually unchanged {{across the country and}} in Cleveland, with larceny-theft down by 7% but burglaries <b>up</b> <b>almost</b> 14%.|$|E

5|$|Herchmer {{recruited}} and {{commanded a}} group of 144 mounted police volunteers, who made <b>up</b> <b>almost</b> half of the new 2nd Battalion of the Canadian Mounted Rifles; {{many of the other}} volunteers in the battalion were also ex-policemen. Soon after the battalion's arrival in South Africa, however, Herchmer's superior, Major General Edward Hutton, concluded that Herchmer was unsuited for military command and retired him from duty. Herchmer complained to the Prime Minister, who then dismissed him from the police altogether, replacing him with Aylesworth Perry, a career policeman and a supporter of the Liberal government.|$|E
5|$|The 2004 Emerald Bowl was a post-season college {{football}} bowl {{game between the}} New Mexico Lobos and the Navy Midshipmen on December 30, 2004 at SBC Park in San Francisco, California, United States. The game, which Navy won with a final score of 34–19, was highlighted by a 26-play drive from the Midshipmen that took <b>up</b> <b>almost</b> 15 minutes of game time and set {{the record for the}} longest drive in a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) {{college football}} game. The contest was the third time the Emerald Bowl was played and the final game of the 2004 NCAA football season for both teams.|$|E
5|$|The 2013 {{tax rate}} {{was set at}} $2.486 per $100 of {{assessed}} value (an overall increase of 3.7% from 2012), which is composed of school taxes of $1.365 (<b>up</b> <b>almost</b> 3.3%), municipal taxes of $0.871 (an increase of 5.8%), a library tax of $.031 (down 3.1%) and county taxes of $0.206 (down 0.5%), plus a municipal open space tax of $0.010 and a county open space tax of $0.003 (both unchanged). The owner of a median-valued home in Teaneck, assessed at $465,300, paid 2011 property taxes of $11,190, which would include $6,244 in school taxes, $3,992 in municipal taxes and $949 to the county (including open space levies).|$|E

5|$|The EMS {{command post}} was set <b>up</b> <b>almost</b> {{immediately}} following the attack and oversaw triage, treatment, transportation, and decontamination. A simple plan/objective was established: treatment and transportation of the injured was to be done as quickly as possible, supplies and personnel to handle {{a large number of}} patients was needed immediately, the dead needed to be moved to a temporary morgue until they could be transferred to the coroner's office, and measures for a long-term medical operation needed to be established. The triage center was set up near the Murrah Building and all the wounded were directed there. Two hundred and ten patients were transported from the primary triage center to nearby hospitals within the first couple hours following the bombing.|$|E
5|$|The Peace Candle {{was first}} erected in 1951, {{and has been}} put <b>up</b> <b>almost</b> every year since then. Due to damage or disrepair, the Peace Candle has been {{replaced}} with new candle structures twice since the original construction. The first candle lasted until 1968, the second candle from 1969 to 1989, and the current candle was built in 1990 {{and is expected to}} last until around 2014. The structure is dedicated to the Easton area {{men and women who have}} served or are serving in the United States armed forces.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} stable isotopes, which make <b>up</b> <b>almost</b> all lead that exists naturally, there are trace {{quantities}} {{of a few}} radioactive isotopes. One of them is lead-210; although it has a half-life of only 22.3 years, small quantities occur in nature because lead-210 is produced by a long decay series that starts with uranium-238 (which has been present for billions of years on Earth). Lead-211, -212, and -214 {{are present in the}} decay chains of uranium-235, thorium-232, and uranium-238, respectively, so traces of all three of these lead isotopes are found naturally. Minute traces of lead-209 arise from the very rare cluster decay of radium-223, one of the daughter products of natural uranium-235. Lead-210 is particularly useful for helping to identify the ages of samples by measuring its ratio to lead-206 (both isotopes are present in a single decay chain).|$|E

5|$|The holotype of S. angustirostris is a {{skull and}} postcrania, so the cranium {{of the species}} is well-described. Bell et al. re-evaluated the entire species in a 2011 {{publication}} with Acta Palaeontologica Polonica. Their description found the skull to be generalized among hadrosaurines, and are much larger than any skulls of S. osborni. The most unusual feature for a hadrosaurine is the long, protruding, solid crest that extends upwards diagonally {{from the back of}} the skull roof. Unlike lambeosaurines, the crests are made up completely of the nasal bone. The premaxilla bones make <b>up</b> <b>almost</b> 50% of the entire skull length, and both sides are filled with small holes. Only in adult individuals has the front of the premaxillary contact been fused. Longer than the premaxilla, the nasal bones are the longest in the skull. They make up the entire length of the crest, and are never preserved as fused.|$|E
5|$|With {{seven seconds}} left in {{regulation}} and the score tied at 28, Yeldon made a long run as time expired. The play was reviewed from the replay booth, and one second was put back on the clock after the referees determined Yeldon had stepped out of bounds just before time expired. Alabama then opted to attempt a game-winning 57-yard field goal, but chose freshman kicker Adam Griffith over Foster due to Foster's woes that day. Alabama failed its fourth field goal of the day with Griffith's attempt falling short, but Auburn's Chris Davis fielded it nine yards deep in his own end zone, and with no Crimson Tide skill players in his path (the field goal unit was made <b>up</b> <b>almost</b> entirely of offensive linemen), sprinted for a 109-yard touchdown return and a 34–28 Auburn win. The loss brought Alabama's all-time record against the Tigers to 42–35–1.|$|E
5|$|Jill {{is later}} kidnapped by Colin, who is {{revealed}} {{to have been}} released from jail. He blackmails her into remarrying him as he alludes that he has information on the music box that Katherine once told him. However, his information ends up being a dead end. After Colin's lies are exposed, Jill locks him in the attic and refuses to let him out until he owns up to his lies, which he eventually does and they patch things <b>up.</b> <b>Almost</b> a year after Katherine's death, Jill finds her most expensive jewelry to have been hidden in a chandelier at the Chancellor Estate. Enclosed with a note, Katherine left them there for Jill to find before her death as they are worth a significant amount. However, {{the meaning of the}} music box continues to remain unknown to everyone. Afterward, all of Katherine's loved ones receive letters from her that were to be delivered on the one-year anniversary of her death. She also asks them to throw a party and celebrate, which they do. Once the party in the park is finished, Jill leaves the music box there, only for it to be stolen by an unidentified person. Jill and Colin return soon after to find the box missing, but Colin convinces her to finally let go of it.|$|E

5|$|The opening {{years of}} the 1980s saw a number of changes in {{personnel}} and direction of established hard rock acts, including the deaths of Bon Scott, the lead singer of AC/DC, and John Bonham, drummer with Led Zeppelin. Whereas Zeppelin broke <b>up</b> <b>almost</b> immediately afterwards, AC/DC pressed on, recording the album Back in Black (1980) with their new lead singer, Brian Johnson. It became the fifth-highest-selling album of all time in the US and the second-highest-selling album in the world. Black Sabbath had split with original singer Ozzy Osbourne in 1979 and replaced him with Ronnie James Dio, formerly of Rainbow, giving the band a new sound and a period of creativity and popularity beginning with Heaven and Hell (1980). Osbourne embarked on a solo career with Blizzard of Ozz (1980), featuring American guitarist Randy Rhoads. Some bands, such as Queen, moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards pop rock, while others, including Rush with Moving Pictures (1981), began {{to return to a}} hard rock sound. The creation of thrash metal, which mixed heavy metal with elements of hardcore punk from about 1982, particularly by Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth and Slayer, helped to create extreme metal and further remove the style from hard rock, although a number of these bands or their members would continue to record some songs closer to a hard rock sound. Kiss moved away from their hard rock roots toward pop metal: firstly removing their makeup in 1983 for their Lick It Up album, and then adopting the visual and sound of glam metal for their 1984 release, Animalize, both of which marked a return to commercial success. Pat Benatar {{was one of the first}} women to achieve commercial success in hard rock, with three successive Top 5 albums between 1980 and 1982.|$|E
