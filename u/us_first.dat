5|$|General Courtney Hodges' <b>U.S.</b> <b>First</b> Army liberated {{the region}} south of Brussels and Maastricht in early September 1944. While two corps of the First Army were {{concentrated}} elsewhere, VIII Corps occupied {{a long stretch}} of the front from the area south of Liège, across the Ardennes and into Luxembourg. The length of the deployment meant that the Corps' front line was only lightly defended, leaving it vulnerable.|$|E

5|$|After {{securing}} {{territory in}} the Cotentin Peninsula south as far as Saint-Lô, the <b>U.S.</b> <b>First</b> Army launched Operation Cobra on 25 July and advanced further south to Avranches by 1 August. The British launched Operation Bluecoat on 30 July to secure Vire and the high ground of Mont Pinçon. Lieutenant General George S. Patton's U.S. Third Army, activated on 1 August, quickly took most of Brittany and territory {{as far south as}} the Loire, while the First Army maintained pressure eastward toward Le Mans to protect their flank. By 3 August, Patton and the Third Army were able to leave a small force in Brittany and drive eastward towards the main concentration of German forces south of Caen. Over Kluge's objections, on 4 August Hitler ordered a counter-offensive (Operation Lüttich) from Vire towards Avranches.|$|E
5|$|Caen was an Operation Overlord {{goal for}} I Corps of the Anglo-Canadian Second Army, which landed forces on two Norman beaches on 6 June 1944, {{to capture the}} city and the Carpiquet area. German {{resistance}} prevented the town from being captured on D-Day, a result considered possible by Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey the Second Army commander. For the next three weeks, positional warfare took place around Caen as both sides attacked and counter-attacked for minor tactical advantage on the Anglo-Canadian front and as part of a strategic intent to force the Germans to keep their most powerful armoured units away from the <b>US</b> <b>First</b> Army, as it captured Cherbourg and then pushed southwards through the bocage towards St. Lô.|$|E
5|$|On April 1 Army Group B {{found itself}} {{completely}} surrounded in the Ruhr by the <b>U.S.</b> <b>First</b> and Ninth Armies. Hitler's {{response was to}} declare the Ruhr a fortress, from which he commanded that {{there was to be}} no surrender or attempt to break out, in an order similar to that which he had issued at Stalingrad. He further ordered that its physical economic infrastructure – the heart of Germany's industrial power – be destroyed by Army Group B to prevent it falling into Allied hands. Model ignored these instructions.|$|E

5|$|Only 100 of the 2,400 tons of {{supplies}} {{scheduled to be}} landed on D-Day were landed. An accurate figure for casualties incurred by V Corps at Omaha on 6 June is not known; sources vary between 2,000 and 4,700 killed, wounded, and missing, with the heaviest losses incurred by the infantry, tanks and engineers in the first landings. Only five tanks of the 741st Tank Battalion were ready for action the next day. The German 352nd division suffered 1,200 killed, wounded and missing; about 20% of its strength. Its deployment at the beach caused such problems that Lieutenant General Omar Bradley, commander of the <b>U.S.</b> <b>First</b> Army, at one stage considered evacuating Omaha, while Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery considered the possibility of diverting V Corps forces through Gold.|$|E
5|$|The 256,300 man strong <b>U.S.</b> <b>First</b> Army, {{commanded}} by General Courtney Hodges, {{was ordered to}} break through the Siegfried Line around the area of Aachen, in order to reach the Rur river. Although the First Army began to encircle the area around Aachen in early September, the Battle of Aachen did not end until 21 October. The city cost the Americans roughly 3,000 casualties, but had opened the path to the Rur (river) river. Despite the casualties taken the ground gained was comparatively worthless, and the fighting for Aachen had not necessarily brought German defeat any closer.|$|E
5|$|The Germans, too, had {{suffered}} heavy casualties; the 116th Panzer Division, for example, {{had lost its}} offensive capabilities after countless attempts to break the <b>U.S.</b> <b>First</b> Army's encirclement of Aachen. This gave American and British commanders {{a false sense of}} security, believing that the Wehrmacht did not have the strength to launch a counteroffensive. Given their view {{on the state of the}} German armed forces and their need to push to the Rur, the First Army decided to drive German forces out of the Hürtgen Forest—located on the Belgian–German border—in an attempt to take a series of dams which could be used by the Germans to flood the valley below.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} {{surrender}} of Nazi Germany on May 8, 1945, plans were underway for the largest operation of the Pacific War, Operation Downfall, the invasion of Japan. The operation had two parts: Operation Olympic and Operation Coronet. Set to begin in October 1945, Olympic involved a series of landings by the U.S. Sixth Army intended to capture the southern third of the southernmost main Japanese island, Kyūshū. Operation Olympic was to be followed in March 1946 by Operation Coronet, the capture of the Kantō Plain, near Tokyo on the main Japanese island of Honshū by the <b>U.S.</b> <b>First,</b> Eighth and Tenth Armies, {{as well as a}} Commonwealth Corps made up of Australian, British and Canadian divisions. The target date was chosen to allow for Olympic to complete its objectives, for troops to be redeployed from Europe, and the Japanese winter to pass.|$|E
5|$|Generalfeldmarschall Gerd von Rundstedt, supreme {{commander}} of the German forces in the west (OB West), directed on 1 July that Caen should be gradually abandoned and {{the bulk of the}} German armoured divisions be shifted to the west end of the beachhead against the <b>US</b> <b>First</b> Army but the city and its surroundings were considered by Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW, Armed Forces High Command) to be fundamental to the defence of Normandy. OKW wanted an arc of defensible terrain from the English Channel to the western banks of the Orne to be held and Adolf Hitler sacked Rundstedt and replaced him with Generalfeldmarschall Günther von Kluge. Learning of this through Ultra, the Allied ground forces commander, General Bernard Montgomery, planned an offensive to capture Caen and to prevent a large redeployment of German forces from the Anglo-Canadian sector to the American front.|$|E
5|$|On 16 December 1944 the Wehrmacht {{launched}} an offensive in the Ardennes region of Belgium, breaking through Allied lines and rapidly advancing towards Antwerp. On {{the afternoon of}} 17 December, General Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander, decided to commit his theater reserve to the Ardennes {{in an attempt to}} halt the German advance; this consisted of the 17th, 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions under the control of XVIII Airborne Corps. The three divisions were to be attached to Courtney Hodges's <b>U.S.</b> <b>First</b> Army and were ordered to concentrate around the town of St Vith. However, while the other two airborne divisions were able to immediately {{make their way to the}} Ardennes as they were already stationed in France, bad weather prevented the 17th from flying in from where the division was stationed in Britain for several days. On 23 December the weather cleared and the division was finally flown to France by emergency night flights. It moved to an assembly area near Rheims. On Christmas Day, the division was attached to George Patton's U.S. Third Army and ordered to assume a thirty-mile long defensive position that ran along the Meuse River near Charleville.|$|E

5|$|The Norman town of Caen was a D-Day {{objective}} for the 3rd Infantry Division, which {{landed on}} Sword Beach on 6 June 1944. The capture of Caen {{was the most}} ambitious objective of I Corps (Lieutenant-General John Crocker). The Overlord plan called for the Second Army (Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey) to secure the city and then form a front line from Caumont-l'Éventé to the south-east of Caen, acquiring airfields and protecting the left flank of the <b>US</b> <b>First</b> Army while it moved on Cherbourg. Possession of Caen and its surroundings would give the Second Army a suitable staging area for a push south to capture Falaise, {{which could be used}} as the pivot for a swing left of the Allied front to advance on Argentan and then towards the Touques River. The terrain between Caen and Vimont was especially promising, being open, dry and conducive to swift offensive operations. The Allies greatly outnumbered the Germans in tanks and mobile units and a battle of manoeuvre would be to their advantage.|$|E
5|$|The <b>U.S.</b> <b>first</b> fired unitary (C-model) Tomahawks at the Khost camps, {{aiming to}} attract militants into the open, then {{launched}} {{a barrage of}} D-model missiles equipped with submunitions to maximize casualties. Sources differ on the precise number of casualties inflicted by the missile strikes. Bin Laden bodyguard Abu Jandal and militant trainee Abdul Rahman Khadr later estimated that only six men {{had been killed in}} the strikes. The Taliban claimed 22 Afghans killed and over 50 seriously injured, while Berger put al-Qaeda casualties at between 20 and 30 men. Bin Laden jokingly told militants that only a few camels and chickens had died, although his spokesman cited losses of six Arabs killed and five wounded, seven Pakistanis killed and over 15 wounded, and 15 Afghans killed. A declassified September 9, 1998, State Department cable stated that around 20 Pakistanis and 15 Arabs died, {{out of a total of}} over 50 killed in the attack. Harkat-ul-Mujahideen's leader, Fazlur Rehman Khalil, initially claimed a death toll of over 50 militants, but later said that he had lost fewer than ten fighters.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{departed for}} the Western Front in June 1918 {{to join the}} American Expeditionary Force (AEF). The division's advance detachment reached Brest, France on 8 June. In late September, the29th received orders to join the <b>U.S.</b> <b>First</b> Army's Meuse-Argonne Offensive {{as part of the}} French XVII Corps. During its 21 days in combat, the 29th Division advanced seven kilometers, captured 2,148 prisoners, and knocked out over 250 machine guns or artillery pieces. Thirty percent of the division became casualties—170 officers and 5,691 enlisted men were killed or wounded. Shortly thereafter the Armistice with Germany was signed on November 11, 1918, ending hostilities between the Central Powers and the Allied Powers. The division returned to the United States in May 1919. It demobilized on 30 May at Camp Dix, New Jersey, though it remained an active National Guard unit.|$|E

5|$|Whale {{was born}} into a large family in Dudley, in the Black Country area of the English West Midlands. He {{discovered}} his artistic talent early on and studied art. With the outbreak of World War I he enlisted in the British Army and became an officer. He was captured by the Germans and during his time as a prisoner of war he realized he was interested in drama. Following his release {{at the end of the}} war he became an actor, set designer and director. His success directing the 1928 play Journey's End led to his move to the <b>US,</b> <b>first</b> to direct the play on Broadway and then to Hollywood, California, to direct films. He lived in Hollywood for the rest of his life, most of that time with his longtime companion, producer David Lewis. Apart from Journey's End (1930), which was released by Tiffany Films, and Hell's Angels (1930), released by United Artists, he directed a dozen films for Universal Pictures between 1931 and 1937, developing a style characterized by the influence of German Expressionism and a highly mobile camera.|$|E
