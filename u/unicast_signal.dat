40|$|Nowadays, {{broadband}} applications, such as {{interactive video}} and multimedia services, have further increased the demand of bandwidth, and thus make high speed multi-wavelength optical access network highly desirable. Wavelength division multiplexing {{passive optical network}} (WDM-PON) is a promising candidate to realize the next generation optical access networks due to its dedicated bandwidth for each subscriber and more flexible bandwidth management. As the network traffic is becoming more data-centric, more networking capabilities are required to provide the data service in a more flexible and reliable way. In this thesis, we have proposed and investigated several interesting optical multicast overlay schemes and network protection architectures for WDM-PONs. Optical multicast overlay technique can support the additional multicast transmission on the existing point-to-point data services, while network protection architectures can assure network availability with short traffic restoration time. We will briefly discuss our work in the following sub-topics. Optical multicast overlay in WDM-PON: Traditional WDM-PONs support only two-way point-to-point data transmission between the optical line terminal (OLT) and the individual subscribers, via the respective designated set of wavelengths. To enhance the network flexibility, it is more desirable to support various different modes of data or video delivery such as broadcast and multicast, in addition to point-to-point transmissions. In this thesis, we systematically investigate the problems and propose our several feasible schemes to overlay multicast transmission onto the existing point-to-point traffic in a WDM-PON. In the first approach, {{the control of the}} multicast transmission is achieved by a simple polarization-assisted scheme at the OLT. By the cross-use of wavelengths, a separate path is provided for the multicast differential phase shift keying (DPSK) data from downstream point-to-point amplitude shift keying (ASK) data without additional light sources, which guarantees the transmission performances in both directions, since the upstream ASK signal is imposed on the multicast DPSK signal. We have also demonstrated its variant, in which an optical switch replaces the polarization-assisted control for multicast transmission. The second approach is based on the optical carrier suppression (OCS) technique at the OLT so as to generate the optical subcarriers or sidebands for multicast ASK data modulation. The downstream unicast data is modulated in DPSK format, which will be re-modulated with the upstream ASK data at the respective optical network unit (ONU). As the downstream <b>unicast</b> <b>signal</b> and the upstream signal are calTied on different fiber feeders, while the upstream signal and the multicast signal are carried on different subcarriers, though on the same fiber feeder, the possible Rayleigh backscattering effect is much alleviated. In the third scheme, by using subcarrier modulation technique, we have first successfully overlaid two independent multicast data streams simultaneously onto a WDM-PON, which is believed to further enhance the network capability for multiple destination traffic and improve the cost effectiveness for the future network. Finally, we will provide a comprehensive comparison on all the proposed schemes in this topic. Survivable network architectures for WDM-PONs: A survivable WDM-PON architecture which can provide self-protection is attractive to avoid enormous loss in data and business due to fiber cuts. To facilitate the network management, the protection switching is realized at the OLT. In this thesis, a simple centrally controlled survivable WDM-PON architecture employing OCS technique is proposed. Protection switching at the OLT employs electrical switches to control the clock signal for the protection sub-carrier generation, via optical carrier suppression. Both distribution and feeder fibers are protected simultaneously. By employing inverse-RZ (IRZ) format for the downstream transmission and non-retum-to-zero (NRZ) for the upstream re-modulated signal, the optical network units are kept colorless and simple. On the other hand, wavelength division multiplexing/time division multiplexing (WDM/TDM) hybrid network, which combines TDM technology and WDM technology, can further increase the network reach, transmission capacity, and reduces the cost per subscriber. Although the bandwidth per subscriber in a WDM/TDM PON is less than that in a WDM-PON, it is still considered as a smooth migration from TDM-PON to WDM-PON. In this thesis, we have proposed a novel WDM/TDM PON architecture which can provide self-protection using a ring topology to connect the subscribers. Finally, we will provide a comprehensive comparison on all the proposed schemes in this topic. Qiu, Yang. Adviser: Chun-Kit Chan.

40|$|Abstract—We {{propose to}} make use of optical sub-carriers to realize optical {{multicast}} overlay on a WDM passive optical network. By employing optical carrier suppression technique at each downstream optical transmitter at the OLT, two co-herent optical sub-carriers are generated to carry the 10 -Gb/s downstream <b>unicast</b> DPSK <b>signal</b> and the 10 -Gb/s downstream multicast ASK signal, separately without any additional light sources. At the ONU, the 10 -Gb/s upstream data is superimposed on the received downstream <b>unicast</b> DPSK <b>signal,</b> to form the upstream ASK signal. System characterization is performed to optimize the performance. In addition, we further demonstrate simultaneous optical overlay of two streams of multicast data in the network.

40|$|Abstract — Multicast {{delivery}} in heterogeneous wireless net-works requires careful coordination, {{in order to}} take full advantage of the resources such an interworking network environment can offer. Such coordination may demand in-terworking signalling from coordinating network entities to receivers of a multicast service. Scalable delivery of inter-working signalling to receivers of multicast user services is of great importance, since the numbers of receivers may be very large. This paper therefore investigates the use of a multicast signalling channel (MSC) to carry such interworking signalling in a scalable manner. Analytical evaluations are performed, comparing required signalling load on the MSC to <b>unicast</b> <b>signalling.</b> In order to further increase the efficiency of the MSC a novel approach is proposed that allows efficient addressing of a subset of receivers within a multicast group. Furthermore guidelines for the selection of a suitable signalling network carrying the MSC are provided...|$|R
40|$|The current 3 G-Cellular {{radio access}} network cannot support many {{concurrent}} high data rate unicast or multicast flows due to limited radio resources. We have proposed a heterogeneous wireless network architecture intended for point-to-multipoint services, to improve the availability of such services to mobile users. The architecture consists of a 3 G-Cellular network, supported {{by a number of}} local ad hoc networks that are established on demand. In this framework the 3 G multipoint-channel range is reduced while the <b>unicast</b> and <b>signalling</b> connections are maintained. Local ad hoc networks are used to forward the multicast data onto users located outside the shortened 3 G multicast-channel range. In this paper we present a performance analysis of multicast streaming on the heterogeneous network architecture. The simulation results are complemented with a sensitivity analysis identifying the impact that parameters like node mobility and traffic patterns will have. The results verify that the architecture and the routing protocol are able to provide multicast services with acceptable quality to the multicast subscribers, while conserving 3 G-Cellular radio resources...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} network {{resources}} (e. g. forwarding capacity, buffer space) by increasingly used real-time multimedia applications is growing. Moreover, their stringent performance requirements (e. g. delay and jitter bounds) pose challenges on network resource management (RM). RM determines how available resources are modeled and distributed {{to achieve a}} performance goal such as assuring forwarding quality to real-time multimedia applications. Improvements to existing RM mechanisms can avoid performance limitations of networks by facilitating more efficient use of scarce resources. For example, in a vehicular to infrastructure (V 2 I) communication scenario that uses IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) lacking RM support for multicast, the 3 G downlink quickly becomes a bottleneck although some information is addressed to multiple receivers. The main goal of this thesis is to develop RM algorithms and protocols that improve forwarding capacity utilization and remove performance bottlenecks. An additional goal {{is to improve the}} scalability of existing RM mechanisms. Three architectural paradigms are covered to demonstrate the advantages of efficient and systematic network RM: open access networks (OAN), next generation networks (NGN), and heterogeneous access networks (HAN). For OAN, a cross-layer signaling technique called parameter injection was developed. It reduces the signaling overhead and update time for real-time multimedia sessions over Wi-Fi while autonomously selecting the format and CODEC that best match the current resource settings. Within NGN, a resource management protocol is proposed for extending <b>unicast</b> <b>signaling</b> in IMS with multicast capabilities. The contribution uses adaptive and dynamic group size selection to improve resource utilization on the 3 G downlink for the signaling and data planes. For HAN, an algorithm is proposed that predicts the best access network for achieving the highest QoE of a real-time multimedia session with the available QoS resources based on regression and statistical learning. In all three paradigms, the provided core contributions serve the common goal of achieving a performance edge in terms of efficiency and systematic operation with a limited amount of network resources.

40|$|Wireless mesh {{networks}} promise cheap Internet access, easy deployment, {{and extended}} range. In their current form, however, these networks suffer from both limited throughput and low reliability; hence they cannot {{meet the demands}} of applications such as file sharing, high definition video, and gaming. Motivated by these problems, we explore an alternative design that addresses these challenges. This dissertation presents a network coded architecture that significantly improves throughput and reliability. It makes a simple yet fundamental switch in network design: instead of routers just storing and forwarding received packets, they mix (or code) packets' content before forwarding. We show through practical systems how routers can exploit this new functionality to harness the intrinsic characteristics of the wireless medium to improve performance. We develop three systems; each reveals a different benefit of our network coded design. COPE observes that wireless broadcast naturally creates an overlap in packets received across routers, and develops a new network coding algorithm to exploit this overlap to deliver the same data in fewer transmissions, thereby improving throughput. ANC pushes network coding to the signal level, showing how to exploit strategic interference to correctly deliver data from concurrent senders, further increasing throughput. Finally, MIXIT presents a symbol-level network code that exploits wireless spatial diversity, forwarding correct symbols even if they are contained in corrupted packets to provide high throughput reliable transfers. The contributions of this dissertation are multifold. First, it builds a strong connection between the theory of network coding and wireless system design. Specifically, the systems presented in this dissertation were the first to show that network coding can be cleanly integrated into the wireless network stack to deliver practical and measurable gains. The work also presents novel algorithms that enrich the theory of network coding, extending it to operate over multiple <b>unicast</b> flows, analog <b>signals,</b> and soft-information. (cont.) Second, we present prototype implementations and testbed evaluations of our systems. Our results show that network coding delivers large performance gains ranging from a few percent to several-fold depending on the traffic mix and the topology. Finally, this work makes a clear departure from conventional network design. Research in wireless networks has largely proceeded in isolation, with the electrical engineers focusing on the physical and lower layers, while the computer scientists worked up from the network layer, with the packet being the only interface. This dissertation pokes a hole in this contract, disposing of artificial abstractions such as indivisible packets and point-to-point links in favor of a more natural abstraction that allows the network and the lower layers to collaborate on the common objectives of improving throughput and reliability using network coding as the building block. At the same time, the design maintains desirable properties such as being distributed, low-complexity, implementable, and integrable {{with the rest of the}} network stack. by Sachin Rajsekhar Katti.
