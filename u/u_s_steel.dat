5|$|The Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company's {{status was}} bolstered {{when it became}} one of the first 12 {{companies}} to be listed on the inaugural Dow Jones Industrial Average, compiled in May 1896. However, it was not long before TCI was eclipsed by its principal competitor, the United States Steel Corporation, a huge conglomerate formed in 1901 out of the enormous Carnegie and Federal steel empires. By the time of the Panic of 1907, <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Steel</b> felt confident enough to launch a takeover bid of its Southern rival. On the morning of Saturday November 2, banker and tycoon J. P. Morgan, one of the founders of <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Steel,</b> convened a meeting in his library and there suggested that <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Steel</b> purchase the stock of an insolvent Wall Street brokerage firm, Moore and Schley, which had secured huge loans against 6 million TCI shares. This was not an entirely selfish gesture, as Morgan recognised that the failure of Moore and Schley would send investor confidence in the markets into a nose-dive. E. H. Gary, president of <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Steel,</b> agreed in principle to this transaction, yet argued that without careful political maneuvering the deal would be seen by Congress as an effort to create a monopoly and thereby encounter troublesome federal anti-trust litigation. Morgan himself had been burnt by crusading Washington trust-busters in 1902 when his Northern Securities Company had been forcibly broken up by the government in a landmark test case.|$|E

Stagnation and decline began in 1962 when a majority of the mines in the Birmingham region were closed as domestic ores and coal were superseded by cheaper foreign products, especially from Venezuela. The 1970s and 80s brought about a downsizing and eventual consolidation of the Fairfield and Ensley works, mirroring the general decline of heavy industry in the USA throughout those decades.|$|E

5|$|TCI was {{not fully}} {{incorporated}} into <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Steel,</b> {{and continued to}} operate as an extremely profitable subsidiary of its parent company well into the 20th century. Immediately following the merger, a venture was launched to create a new, larger TCI plant {{to the west of}} Ensley and {{at the center of a}} new company town, and so in 1910 work on the planned community of Corey, Alabama, began. Named after an executive who later committed suicide, Corey was soon renamed Fairfield, and the steel works there opened in 1917. With the discovery of new coking coal and ore deposits in the region, and with the aid of U. S. Steel's enormous capital, the Fairfield works were quickly expanded with the construction of new steel mills and rail links. Several rolling mills were completed in 1917, which produced ship materials for the nearby shipbuilding plants in Chickasaw, Alabama, in support of America's sudden entry into World War I. In 1920 a direct rail line between Fairfield and Birmingport, the new port of Birmingham on the Warrior River was opened. This was followed by the completion of the 'High Ore Line Railroad', which connected the Red Mountain and the Fairfield works; trains literally rolled down the hill from mine to mill. In 1923 a merchant steel mill was completed, followed by the opening of a sheet products mill in 1926.|$|E

Convinced by Gary that <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Steel</b> only wished to purchase Moore and Schley's stock in order to inject liquidity into the firm and thereby shore up investor confidence in the wider economy, Roosevelt granted the transaction antitrust immunity in November 1907, a decision {{for which he was}} later derided by critics as a hypocrite. Indeed, in 1911 the federal government sought to undo what it perceived to be Roosevelt's mistake and (without success) sued <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Steel.</b> In the meantime, Moore and Schley was saved from collapse, the panic soon subsided and <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Steel</b> was rewarded with a valuable prize [...] a controlling stake in TCI. <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Steel</b> immediately replaced the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company on the Dow Jones Index, where it remained until 1991.|$|E

40|$|Production of {{iron and}} steel is an {{energy-intensive}} manufacturing process.

The energy efficiency of steel production has a direct impact on overall energy consumption and related carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. The goal {{of this study is to}} develop a methodology for making an accurate comparison of the energy intensity (energy use per unit of steel produced) of steel production. The methodology is applied to the steel industry in China and the <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> The methodology addresses issues related to boundary definitions, conversion factors, and indicators in order to develop a common framework for comparing steel industry energy use. This study uses a bottom-up, physical-based method to compare the energy intensity of China and <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> crude <b>steel</b> production in 2006. This year was chosen in order to maximize the availability of comparable steel-sector data. However, data published in China and the <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> are not always consistent in terms of analytical scope, conversion factors, and information on adoption of energy-saving technologies. This study is primarily based on published annual data from the China Iron & Steel Association and National Bureau of Statistics in China and the Energy Information Agency in the <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> This report found that the energy intensity of steel production is lower in the United States than China primarily due to structural differences in the steel industry in these two countries. In order to understand the differences in energy intensity of steel production in both countries, this report identified key determinants of sector energy use in both countries. Five determinants analyzed in this report include: share of electric arc furnaces in total steel production, sector penetration of energy-efficiency technologies, scale of production equipment, fuel shares in the iron and steel industry, and final steel product mix in both countries. The share of lower energy intensity electric arc furnace production in each country was a key determinant of total steel sector energy efficiency. Overall steel sector structure, in terms of average plant vintage and production capacity, is also an important variable though data were not available to quantify this in a scenario. The methodology developed in this report, along with the accompanying quantitative and qualitative analyses, provides a foundation for comparative international assessment of steel sector energy intensity...|$|R

40|$|Several {{theories}} of firm performance {{can explain the}} well known observation that survival is positively related to age. However, a more mundane explanation-selection bias driven by variations in firm quality-may also underlie the phenomenon. This paper employs a 90 year plant-level panel data set on the <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> iron and <b>steel</b> shipbuilding industry of the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries to discriminate between the explanations. The shipbuilding industry exhibits the usual joint dependence of survival on age and size, but this dependence is eliminated after controlling for heterogeneity by using preentry experience as a proxy for firm quality. The evidence points to a dominant role for selection bias in creating the age dependence of survival. At the same time, preentry experience is found to have a large and extremely persistent effect on survival, and this finding is inconsistent with standard explanations for the role of preentry experience on firm performance. © 2005 President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which the rising relative energy prices of the past decade have influenced managerial decisions in <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> iron and <b>steel</b> manufacturing. Efforts at energy conservation, as well as opportunities for short-run substitutions among energy sources, were constrained mainly by existing process technology. The actual pattern of substitution can be explained to a large extent by changes in techniques. Decisions concerning such investments were guided by many factors, among which considerations of energy savings played only a minor role. This observation can be explained by the fact that, although the industry in the aggregate is a prodigious consumer of energy, energy costs at any one production stage are but a small fraction of total variable costs. Integrated greenfield plants embodying state-of-the-art technology would achieve much higher levels of energy efficiency than are currently realized, but such new plants are unlikely to be built in the United States, under the current conditions of global excess capacity. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{commonly}} held {{view is that}} innovation, deriving directly from expenditure on research and development, brings increased productivity, lower costs, increased profitability and growth, and that these relationships form a economically virtuous circle. However, this view is not supported either by the research results reported here or by other empirical findings. A richer and deeper framework of analysis than this "mythology" provides is required for management decision making in innovation and {{in this and the}} subsequent paper the author outlines the necessary features of such a framework. A model of a "network of productivity relationships" with six components is described which traces the effects of innovation, at any point in the network, on input productivities. The model points up the futility of single input measures of innovatory effects. This network is then combined with cost factors to show the effect on categories of unit costs and on total unit cost. Finally, profitability is related to the physical and cost factors to provide managerial control ratios which offer the relevent criteria by which innovation many be appraised. The history of innovation in the <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> Basic <b>Steel</b> Industry is examined {{in the light of the}} model described above and hypotheses are proposed to identify possible productivity and cost effects of innovation with a view ot improving general predictive capability of the results of any given type of innovation. ...|$|R
