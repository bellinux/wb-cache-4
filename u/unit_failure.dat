5|$|After the Belgian Grand Prix on 2 September, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} mid-season testing at various European race circuits between 4–7 September {{to prepare for}} the Italian Grand Prix at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza. Ferrari, Williams, BAR, Jordan and Minardi tested at the Mugello Circuit. Rubens Barrichello for Ferrari set the fastest times on the first and second days. The second day of testing was disrupted on six occasions after BAR test driver Takuma Sato went off the circuit, suffered an electronic control <b>unit</b> <b>failure</b> and had a malfunctioning anti-stall system. BAR driver Olivier Panis and Minardi driver Alex Yoong both had problems with their clutch and gearboxes. On the final day Michael Schumacher set the fastest lap of 1 minute and 24.226 seconds, four-tenths ahead of Panis. Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer spent three days at his team's private test track the Fiorano Circuit where he did practice starts as well as testing of launch control and traction control.|$|E
5|$|While racing for {{position}} on lap 23, Sainz forced Jolyon Palmer {{off the track}} in turn two and was later handed a ten-second time penalty for the incident. Four laps later, Pascal Wehrlein tried to overtake Felipe Nasr for 16th, but was unsuccessful and in turn lost a position to Kvyat. His teammate Ricciardo overtook Kevin Magnussen for eighth on lap 29, but lost the position again and was in turn passed by Romain Grosjean. As Nico Rosberg started to lap backmarkers on lap 31, the gap to second-placed Hamilton started to come down, with his advantage dropping from more than eleven seconds to {{a little more than}} seven seconds by lap 36. Meanwhile, Verstappen was forced to retire due to power <b>unit</b> <b>failure</b> on lap 34, while running in sixth place. As Hamilton was told by his pit crew that he suffered from a water pressure problem, his gap to Rosberg started to increase again, staying at 13 seconds by lap 41. Wehrlein made a pit stop for new tyres on the same lap, but problems with his stop forced him stationary for almost a minute, resulting in him moving into last place on the road.|$|E
2500|$|Mercedes {{won their}} first World Constructors' Championship {{after taking a}} 1–2 finish in Russia. Lewis Hamilton won his second World Drivers' Championship after a season-long battle with {{teammate}} Nico Rosberg. Rosberg won the Australian and Monaco Grands Prix, and Hamilton the races in Malaysia, Bahrain, China and Spain after retiring in Australia. The Mercedes team's run of victories ended in Canada where Rosberg and Hamilton were simultaneously hit with a power <b>unit</b> <b>failure</b> that put additional strain on their brakes. Hamilton was {{forced out of the}} race and while Rosberg was able to continue, his performance deteriorated and he ultimately finished second. Mercedes returned {{to the top of the}} podium in Austria, with Rosberg leading Hamilton across the finish line for his third victory of the season. Hamilton reclaimed ground in the championship standings in Britain winning after Rosberg was forced out with gearbox issues. Rosberg claimed the win in Germany, while Hamilton recovered to third after an accident in qualifying saw him start from twentieth place. Hamilton finished third in Hungary after starting from pit lane, ahead of Rosberg. Rosberg had to settle for second place in Belgium after contact with Hamilton early in the race, which ultimately prompted Mercedes to retire Hamilton's car. Hamilton went on to claim his sixth win of the season in Italy, ahead of Rosberg. Hamilton reclaimed the championship lead with a win in Singapore, while Rosberg was retired with a broken wiring loom. Hamilton claimed the win in rain- and accident-shortened Japan, ahead of Rosberg. Hamilton won the inaugural race in Russia, once again ahead of Rosberg. The result was enough for Mercedes to secure their first World Constructors' Championship. Hamilton took his fifth consecutive win – for the first time in his career – in the United States, again ahead of Rosberg. Rosberg took his fifth win of the season in Brazil, with Hamilton finishing in second. Hamilton carried a seventeen-point advantage into the title-deciding [...] and went on to win the race while Rosberg struggled with electrical problems and finished outside the points. With eleven pole positions to his name, Rosberg won the inaugural FIA Pole Trophy.|$|E

30|$|Note that a {{producer}} that sells its {{production in the}} pool during the two hours of the study horizon {{does not have any}} contracting obligation to sell electricity. In contrast, as previously discussed, selling electricity through a forward contract necessarily involves the purchase of the agreed energy in the pool during those time steps in which the generating unit is forced out. For this reason, in this example, we consider a power producer that sells its production through a forward contract spanning the second hour, whose price is fixed to the average pool price during this period (18.75 €/MWh), and that evaluates the possibility of acquiring a call option to reduce the financial losses associated with unexpected <b>unit</b> <b>failures.</b> In doing so, if scenarios characterized by <b>unit</b> <b>failures</b> and high pool prices are likely, the producer generally exercises the option to buy electricity at a lower price. In this example, the option strike price is set to be 15 €/MWh (a price higher than the unit production cost and lower than the forward contract price) and its option price is set to be 0.1 €/MWh for illustration purposes.|$|R
30|$|As a {{consequence}} of competition in electricity markets, {{a wide variety of}} financial derivatives have emerged to allow market agents to hedge against risks. Electricity options and forward contracts constitute adequate instruments to manage the financial risks pertaining to price volatility or unexpected <b>unit</b> <b>failures</b> faced by power producers. A multi-stage stochastic model is described in this tutorial paper to determine the optimal forward and option contracting decisions for a risk-averse power producer. The key features of electricity options to reduce both price and availability risks are illustrated by using two examples.|$|R
50|$|A {{proof test}} {{is a form}} of stress test to {{demonstrate}} the fitness of a load-bearing structure, or rescue strop. An individual proof test may apply only to the unit tested, or to its design in general for mass-produced items. Such a structure is often subjected to loads above that expected in actual use, demonstrating safety and design margin. Proof testing is nominally a nondestructive test, particularly if both design margins and test levels are well-chosen. However, <b>unit</b> <b>failures</b> are by definition considered to have been destroyed for their originally-intended use and load levels.|$|R
50|$|At the , Ricciardo had {{qualified}} {{second on}} his first race for the team while Vettel qualified a rather distant 13th being at least 1.8 seconds off pole-sitter Lewis Hamilton. In the race itself Ricciardo finished second while Vettel retired after just three laps due to a power <b>unit</b> <b>failure.</b> However, after the race Ricciardo was disqualified for being {{in violation of the}} FIA's new rule of capping fuel use at 100 kg per hour in each race. He thus lost his podium finish. Red Bull appealed this decision on 14 April, but lost their case.|$|E
50|$|Unit Compliance Inspection (UCI) is a United States Air Force {{inspection}} {{conducted to}} assess areas mandated by law, {{as well as}} mission areas identified by senior Air Force and Major Command (MAJCOM) leadership as critical or important {{to the health and}} performance of a <b>unit.</b> <b>Failure</b> to comply with established directives in these areas could result in significant legal liabilities, penalties, or significant mission impact. During CIs, MAJCOM inspector generals evaluate each common core compliance area (CCCA), which is driven by law, executive order, or applicable directive. Examples of Air Force-level CCCAs based on law are intelligence oversight, transition assistance programs, voting assistance programs, sexual harassment education and prevention, and homosexual conduct policy.|$|E

30|$|Power {{producers}} face uncertainties {{related to}} price variability and production availability when trading in electricity markets. Thus, power producers must make their decisions {{not only to}} maximize the expected profit but also to reduce the profit variability caused by the uncertainty involved. While hedging against price risk through forward contracts increases the availability risk due to unexpected <b>unit</b> <b>failures,</b> electricity options allow producers to delay decisions on selling or buying a given amount of electricity at a fixed price {{until the beginning of}} the delivery period of the option. This postponement gives the holder of the option additional information to make better decisions.|$|R
5000|$|The {{team made}} an {{impressive}} {{start at the}} [...] with Vergne qualifying 6th, Toro Rosso's best qualifying result since the 2013 British Grand Prix and Kvyat qualifying 8th. The drivers finished the race 8th and 9th respectfully to score Toro Rosso's first points of the season, and his result, Kvyat had broken Sebastian Vettel's record as the youngest points scorer in Formula One history. At the , Vergne qualified 9th while Kvyat qualified 11th. The race was going well for them until on lap 18, Vergne suffered a power <b>unit</b> <b>failure</b> in his car, {{which has been a}} common occurrence in Renault powered cars at that point in the season. Meanwhile, Kvyat finished 10th and scored 1 point but was ultimately a lap down from the race winner.|$|E
50|$|In {{the opening}} round in Australia, he {{finished}} seventh, a lap down. However, he would not score again until Canada. In Hungary, mid-race, he suffered a big crash at turn one when his front wing detached and he drove over it, sending him slightly airborne and into the barriers. He then failed to finish five of the next seven races. In Belgium, he had a power <b>unit</b> <b>failure</b> {{on the way to}} the grid, while in Singapore, he was tagged by Felipe Massa at turn three and spun into the barriers, and received a three place grid penalty after being deemed responsible. In Russia he spun at turn two at the start and collected Marcus Ericsson and in the United States he slid into Daniel Ricciardo and broke his front right suspension.|$|E
50|$|Under-gate Jack {{operators}} usually {{control the}} gate by directly moving the pivot point of each gate leaf. This makes the unit ideal cosmetically and {{also allows for}} up to 180 degrees of leaf swing as required. However controlling the pivot point of the gate, is like opening a door by twisting the hinge, and as so is very difficult due to the loads needed at that point. This is highlighted with snap, as the gate has to change direct, {{as soon as it}} can. For this reason they are recommend as only suitable for ‘Domestic’ systems in a low risk of abuse environment. Another major consideration with the use of under-gate units is that of water immersion/ingress and warranty voidance. If the water table is high or the drainage of the unit’s foundation box inadequate throughout the systems life, then water ingress and <b>unit</b> <b>failure</b> is increased.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA machine {{consists}} of two stochastically failing <b>units.</b> <b>Failure</b> of either of the <b>units</b> causes a <b>failure</b> of the machine and the failed unit has to be replaced immediately. Associated with the units are running costs which increase with {{the age of the}} unit because of increasing maintenance costs, decreasing output, etc. A preventive replacement policy is proposed under which, at failure points, we also replace the second unit if its age exceeds a predetermined control limit. It is proved that, for two identical units with exponential life-time distributions and linear running costs, this policy is optimal and the optimal control limit is calculated. In an additional model we take into consideration the length of time it takes to replace one unit or both units. The method of solution is a variation of dynamic semi-Markov programming. Analytical results are obtained and the influence of the various parameters on them is investigated. Finally, we study the saving due to our policy in comparison with a policy in which only failed units are replaced...|$|R

5000|$|The last {{military}} Shuttle {{mission was}} flown by Atlantis. The mission execution order (91-7) was implemented on 11 October 1991, but the scheduled launch was delayed {{for five days}} in mid-November due to {{a problem with the}} payload's IUS. A handful of optics, communications and weather instrumentation problems also cropped up during the countdown on 24 November, and the Range Safety Display System required a reload approximately half an hour before launch. Despite those problems, Atlantis' lift-off from Pad 39A went smoothly at 2344:00Z on 24 November 1991. The primary objective of the mission was to deploy a Defense Support Program (DSP) satellite approximately 6 hours and 18 minutes into the flight. The crew deployed the DSP spacecraft as scheduled at 0603Z on 25 November, but the mission was terminated three days early due to an Inertial Measurement <b>Unit</b> <b>failure</b> aboard the Shuttle. Though a landing at KSC was scheduled, Atlantis was ultimately diverted to Edwards Air Force Base for her landing.

50|$|For {{historical}} {{reasons the}} <b>failure</b> rate <b>units</b> of Ta-e-caps and Al-e-caps are different. For Al-e-caps the reliability prediction is generally {{expressed in a}} failure rate λ, with the <b>unit</b> <b>Failures</b> In Time (FIT) at standard operating conditions 40 °C and 0.5 UR {{during the period of}} constant random failures. This is the number of failures that can be expected in one billion (109) component-hours of operation (e.g., 1000 components for 1 million hours, or 1 million components for 1000 hours which is 1 ppm/1000 hours) at the standard operating conditions. This failure rate model implicitly assumes that failures are random. Individual components fail at random times but at a predictable rate. The reciprocal value of FIT is Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF).|$|R
40|$|Dicer is {{a central}} enzymatic player in RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) pathways that acts to regulate gene expression in nearly all eukaryotes. Although the cytoplasmic function of Dicer is well-documented in mammals, its nuclear function remains obscure. Here we show that Dicer is present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, but that its nuclear levels are tightly regulated. In its nuclear manifestation, Dicer interacts with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) at actively-transcribed gene loci. Loss of Dicer causes the appearance of endogenous dsRNA, leading to induction of the interferon response pathway and consequent cell death. Our results suggest that Pol II-associated Dicer restricts endogenous dsRNA formation from overlapping non-coding RNA transcription <b>units.</b> <b>Failure</b> to do so has catastrophic effects on cell function...|$|R
