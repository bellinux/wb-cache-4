5|$|Sony Pictures was dubious over Stone's {{choice of}} Crowe {{because he was}} not a famous actor in the mid-1990s. To cast Gene Hackman in the role of Herod, TriStar Pictures changed the {{shooting}} location from Durango, Mexico to Tucson, Arizona. Sam Rockwell auditioned for The Kid, a role which ended <b>up</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Leonardo DiCaprio. Sony was also dubious over DiCaprio's casting. As a result, Stone decided to pay for the actor's salary herself.|$|E

5|$|Writer Darin Morgan had {{pieces of}} the script for a long time, drawing {{inspiration}} from research he had done on hypnosis and a book on government coverups and UFOs that theorized that UFOs are a phenomenon that manipulate space and time, but are not piloted by aliens. Morgan had {{the idea for the}} teaser in mind before becoming a staff member on the show. The narrative style was influenced by a casting session Morgan witnessed where an actor auditioning sounded like Truman Capote. From this he {{came up with the idea}} to have a writer covering the case. Capote died in 1984, and second choice Rip Taylor was unavailable, so the role of Jose Chung ended <b>up</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Charles Nelson Reilly. Jesse Ventura was cast as one of the men in black, while the other, which Morgan had originally wanted Johnny Cash for, went to Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek. The role of Lord Kinbote went to stuntman Tony Morelli.|$|E

He makes his escape, but the old lady chases him out onto the streets. Gary quickly finds one of the gangster snails he saw before, which the old lady now mistakes for Miss Tuftsy, and takes him home instead. Back home, SpongeBob gives up on his search for Gary, and tries to forget about him by taking a walk, but his memories keep coming to mind and upsetting him.

25|$|The {{final game}} of the 2007/2008 regular season saw Sydney's largest crowd of the season, it drew a large crowd of 33,458 people. Sydney needed to win by at least 2 goals, and they got off to a flying start, with Steve Corica scoring in the 3rd minute. For the rest of the half Melbourne looked shellshocked, and never really {{recovered}} from to shock early goal. But they hit back 25seconds after the break, with Sydney's minds still back in the dressing room, Melbourne midfielder Nick Ward flew down the right wing and took a shot, which ended up rebounding into Sydney defender Mark Milligan, ending up as an own goal.

25|$|In Game 4, Sacramento again {{got out to}} a fast {{start with}} a 40-point first quarter and built a 24-point first half lead. However, the Lakers cut the lead to 14 at halftime with a Samaki Walker 3-pointer at the buzzer that should not have counted (replay was not used at the time), and to 7 after three quarters. They whittled it down to 2 on the final {{possession}} {{with a chance to}} tie or win it, but Bryant missed a running layup and Shaq missed a put-back attempt. Divac knocked the ball away from the hoop in an attempt to run out the clock, but instead it wound <b>up</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> a wide open Robert Horry at the arc, who hit a 3 over Webber at the buzzer to give the Lakers an improbable victory, which tied the series going back to Sacramento.

25|$|Throughout the 1960s, filming {{continued}} on Quixote on-and-off {{until the end}} of the decade, as Welles evolved the concept, tone and ending several times. Although he had a complete version of the film shot and edited at least once, he would continue toying with the editing well into the 1980s, he never completed a version film he was fully satisfied with, and would junk existing footage and shoot new footage. (In one case, he had a complete cut ready in which Quixote and Sancho Panza end <b>up</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the moon, but he felt the ending was rendered obsolete by the 1969 moon landings, and burned 10 reels of this version.) As the process went on, Welles gradually voiced all of the characters himself and provided narration. In 1992, the director Jesús Franco constructed a film out of the portions of Quixote left behind by Welles. Some of the film stock had decayed badly. While the Welles footage was greeted with interest, the post-production by Franco was met with harsh criticism.|$|E

25|$|According to his accounts, Cooper {{realized}} that these men, who {{on a regular}} basis have seen experimental aircraft flying and landing around them as part of their job of filming those aircraft, were clearly worked up and unnerved. They explained how the saucer hovered over them, landed 50 yards away from them using three extended landing gears and then took off as they approached for a closer look. They took photographs and film. There was a special Pentagon number to call to report such incidents: called and soon was reported up the chain of command until he was instructed by a general to have the film developed, but to make no prints of it, and send it right away in a locked courier pouch. As he had not been instructed to not look at the negatives before sending them, he did. He said the quality of the photography was excellent as would be expected from the experienced photographers who took them. What he saw was exactly what they had described to him. He did not see the film before everything was sent away. He expected {{that there would be a}} follow up investigation since an aircraft of unknown origin had landed in a highly classified military installation, but nothing was ever said of the incident again. He was never able to track down what happened to those photos.
