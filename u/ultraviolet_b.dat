25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, {{research}} in Hunter Valley vineyards {{discovered that a}} wide range of pathogens caused various occurrences of bunch rot in the vineyards. These other pathogens included Colletotrichum acutatum (ripe rot), Greeneria uvicola (bitter rot) and other fungi from the genera of Aspergillus, Penicillium and Alternaria. Susceptibility of certain wine grape varieties were found to increase as the grapes reached higher Brix sugar levels. Further research in the 2000s, showed that some of the open canopy techniques used to prevent Botrytis grey rot may actually promote the development of some of these other types of rot. Ripe rot, in particular, seemed to thrive at the higher <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> (280–320nm) light exposure that open canopies allow. To compound the potential problem for Hunter Valley wine growers is that, as of 2010, there wasn't any fungicides registered for use for this disease.|$|E
500|$|Solar urticaria, {{due to its}} {{particular}} features, {{is considered to be}} a type of physical urticaria or light sensitivity. Physical urticaria arises from physical [...] factors in the environment, [...] which in the [...] case of solar urticaria is [...] UV radiation or light. SU may be classified based on the wavelength of the radiative energy that causes the allergic reaction; known as Harber's classification, six types have been identified in this system. Type I solar urticaria is caused by UVB (<b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B)</b> radiation, with wavelengths ranging from 290–320nm. Type II is induced by UVA (ultraviolet A) radiation with wavelengths that can range from 320–400nm. The wavelength range of type III and IV spans from 400 to 500nm, while type V can be caused by UVB radiation to visible light (280–600nm). Type VI has only been known to occur at 400nm.|$|E

40|$|Two major {{components}} of epidermal cells, keratinocytes[*]and Langerhans cells, are injured by <b>ultraviolet</b> light <b>B</b> radiation, resulting in sunburn cell (apoptotic cell) formation, impaired function, and a reduced number of Langerhans cells. Quantitative analysis of Langerhans cell damage is usually performed using epidermal sheets, whereas that of keratinocytes has been performed by counting {{the number of}} sunburn[*]cells in vertical tissue sections. In this study we assessed the influences of <b>ultraviolet</b> light <b>B</b> radiation on epidermal cells by apoptotic cell formation, using murine epidermal sheets stained by terminal deoxynucleotidyl[*]transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling technique. Ten to 75 [*]mJ per cm 2 of <b>ultraviolet</b> light <b>B</b> radiation induced apoptotic cells in abdominal skin of C 3 H mice. The cells were induced in 6 [*]h after 50 [*]mJ per cm 2 of <b>ultraviolet</b> light <b>B</b> irradiation with the peak in number in 24 [*]h, 18. 8 [*]±[*] 5. 0 per mm 2 and 97. 7 [*]±[*] 7. 4 per mm 2, respectively. One week later, the apoptotic cells were not visualized. As C 3 H/He, BALB/C, and C 57 BL/ 6 mice showed almost the same frequency of apoptosis in epidermal sheets from 50 [*]mJ per cm 2 ultraviolet light B-irradiated skin, the induction of the cells by <b>ultraviolet</b> light <b>B</b> radiation did not depend on the genetic trait of the mouse. Xeroderma pigmentosum type A gene-deficient mice, however, showed a greater induction of apoptotic cells (216. 9 [*]±[*] 25. 2 per mm 2) by <b>ultraviolet</b> light <b>B</b> radiation than xeroderma pigmentosum type A wild-type mice (89. 5 [*]±[*] 13. 6 per mm 2) and conventional mice. Pretreatment with a SPF 60 sunscreen agent was quite effective in reducing the induction of apoptotic cells. Using confocal laser scanning microscopy and double staining, 1. 5 [*]±[*] 2. 7 % of apoptotic cells were Ia-positive cells in 24 [*]h after 50 [*]mJ per cm 2 of ultraviolet light B[*]radiation. Apoptotic Ia-positive cells were not observed 48 [*]h after the radiation. On the other hand,[*]no apoptotic dendritic epidermal T cells were observed in up to 75 [*]mJ per cm 2 of <b>ultraviolet</b> light <b>B</b> radiated skin. Thus, nearly all apoptotic cells were keratinocytes,[*]and Langerhans cells and dendritic epidermal T cells appeared resistant to ultraviolet light B-induced apoptosis. Compared with the assessment in vertical tissue sections, the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling technique with epidermal sheets appeared to be a more physiologically[*]relevant method for quantitative evaluation of apoptotic epidermal cells induced by <b>ultraviolet</b> light <b>B</b> radiation...|$|R

2500|$|Coon's (1939) {{theory that}} the Nordic race was a depigmentated {{variation}} of the greater Mediterranean racial stock was also supported by his mentor Earnest Albert Hooton who {{in the same year}} published Twilight of Man, which notes: [...] "The Nordic race is certainly a depigmented offshoot from the basic long-headed Mediterranean stock. It deserves separate racial classification only because its blond hair (ash or golden), its pure blue or grey eyes". A 1990s study by Ulrich Mueller found that depigmentation of Nordic peoples around the Baltic Sea likely occurred due to vitamin D deficiency amongst peoples living there 10,000-30,000 years ago who had a lack of access to vitamin D foods such as dairy products at the time.

50|$|Photoreceptors, {{similar to}} those found in the retina of the eye, detect {{potentially}} damaging ultraviolet radiation (ultraviolet A specifically), inducing increased production of melanin by melanocytes. Thus tanning potentially offers the skin rapid protection from DNA damage and sunburn caused by ultraviolet radiation (DNA damage caused by <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B).</b> However, whether this offers protection is debatable, because the amount of melanin released by this process is modest in comparison to the amounts released in response to DNA damage caused by <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> radiation.|$|E

40|$|In {{normal human}} melanocytes various mitogens {{activate}} the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK 1 / 2 and the downstream transcription factor CREB (Ca 2 +/cAMP response element binding protein). Endothelin- 1, basic fibroblast growth factor, and α-melanotropin interact synergistically to stimulate human melanocyte proliferation. The former two mitogens phosphorylated ERK 1 / 2, its substrate p 90 rsk, and CREB. α-Melanotropin, forskolin, or dibutyryl cAMP failed to phosphorylate {{any of those}} targets, however. The concomitant presence of endothelin- 1, basic fibroblast growth factor, and α-melanotropin significantly potentiated CREB phosphorylation. The mitogen-induced phosphorylation of p 90 rsk and CREB was dependent on ERK 1 / 2 activation, and was mediated by intracellular calcium mobilization and by protein kinase C and tyrosine kinase activation, but not by activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. Exposure of melanocytes to <b>ultraviolet</b> radiation <b>B</b> resulted in the phosphorylation of the stress-induced mitogen- activated protein kinases p 38 and JNK/SAPK, but not ERK 1 / 2. <b>Ultraviolet</b> radiation <b>B</b> induced the phosphorylation of CREB via a pathway that was partially dependent on p 38, but {{had no effect on}} p 90 rsk or ERK 1 / 2.

40|$|Backgrounds - <b>Ultraviolet</b> {{radiation}} <b>B</b> (UVRB) is {{the most}} important environmental factor capable of altering the immune function of human skin. Objective: To evaluate the association of the phenotypes of susceptibility or resistance to <b>ultraviolet</b> radiation <b>B</b> (UVRB) and the polar forms of leprosy. Material and methods: We evaluated 38 patients with lepromatous leprosy (LL) and 87 patients with tuberculoid (TT) leprosy, according to the classification by Ridley and Jopling (1966). All the patients were submitted to a test to determine the phenotypes of susceptibility or resistance to UVRB through the application of a 2 % dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) disc to a previously irradiated area with twice the minimal erythema dose (MED). After 21 days, a similar disc soaked in 0. 05 % DNCB was applied to the scapular area (unexposed to UVRB) to check for sensitiveness, with reading of the results after 48 hours. The patients that showed a positive reaction to DNCB were considered resistant (UVB-R) {{and those who did not}} show any reaction were considered susceptible (UVB-S). Results: The frequency of UVB-S individuals was 63. 2 % (24 patients) in the LL group and 34. 4 % (30 patients) in the TT group (OR= 3. 26; IC= 1. 36 - 7. 87; x 2 = 7. 73; p= 0. 005).

50|$|Of {{the various}} {{components}} of sunlight, <b>ultraviolet</b> radiation <b>B</b> (UVB) (290-320 nm) {{is considered to}} be the most harmful. This type of radiation acts primarily on the epidermis, and in particular the keratinocytes. Keratinocytes are known to form a barrier to provide a layer of protection within the skin against environmental hazards. Within the epidermis, in addition to the keratinocytes, there are melanocytes (melanin producing cells). These cells produce pigment that provides the keratinocytes with protection against UVB radiation. Once the keratinocytes have been damaged irreparably as a result of UVB radiation, they are marked for destruction by apoptosis to eliminate them as they are potentially mutagenic cells. Failure of the body to remove DNA damaged cells increases the risk of skin cancer.|$|R
