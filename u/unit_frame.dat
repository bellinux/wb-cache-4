This provides a benefit that can significantly reduce building construction time. The structural design is usually carried out {{under the assumption that}} their load-carrying mechanism {{is similar to that of}} traditional steel moment-resisting systems. However, both systems are different in terms of beam-column connection details which may strongly influence the lateral structural behavior. Specially, the presence of access holes in a beam-column joint of a <b>unit</b> modular <b>frame</b> could cause undesirable failure during strong earthquakes. Therefore, this study carried out finite element analyses (FEMs) of <b>unit</b> modular <b>frames</b> to investigate the cyclic behavior of beam-column joints with the access holes.

Additional master degrees of freedom are required in substructure dynamic analysis to achieve reliable solutions.
