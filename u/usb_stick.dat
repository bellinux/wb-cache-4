25|$|The {{band was}} praised for a unique use of USB flash drive technology. The band offered its 2004 Barenaked For the Holidays album on a {{customized}} flash drive in MP3 format, with extras including bonus tracks, and photos and videos {{from the studio}} sessions for the album.

500|$|In 2002, Dave Matthews Band {{released}} Busted Stuff {{in response}} to the Internet-fuelled success of The Lillywhite Sessions which they had not intended to release. Queen released 100 bootlegs for sale as downloads on the band's official website, with profits going to the Mercury Phoenix Trust. Although the recording of concerts by King Crimson and its guitarist Robert Fripp is prohibited, Fripp's musiccompany Discipline Global Mobile (DGM) sells concert recordings as downloads, especially [...] "archival recordings" [...] produced from the recordings from the concerts' mixing consoles. With an even greater investment of sound engineering, DGM has released [...] "official bootlegs", which are produced from one or more fan bootlegs. [...] DGM's reverse engineering of the distribution-networks for bootlegs helped it to make a successful transition to an age of digital distribution, [...] "unique" [...] (in 2009) among music labels. In the 21st century, artists responded to the demand for recordings of live shows by experimenting with the sale of authorized bootlegs made directly from the soundboard, with a superior quality to an audience recording. Metallica, Phish and Pearl Jam have been regularly distributing instant live bootlegs of their concerts. In 2014, Springsteen announced he would allow fans to purchase a <b>USB</b> <b>stick</b> at concerts, which could be used to download a bootleg of the show.|$|E

He then spent a significant amount of time analysing the content and only published material which he believed was in the public interest. He was careful to avoid releasing sensitive material about Slater and others mentioned in the hacked emails which did not involve a significant public interest.|$|E
