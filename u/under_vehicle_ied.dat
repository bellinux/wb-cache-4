New technologies such as mobile robots and computer vision are led to have more secure environment. This paper proposed that a mobile robot like Aria robot can be used to search and inspect the bombs under parking a lot vehicle. This robot is using fuzzy logic and subsumption algorithms to control the robot that movies underneath the vehicle. An OpenCV library and laser Hokuyo are added to Aria robot to complete the experiment for <b>under</b> <b>vehicle</b> inspection. This experiment was conducted at the indoor environment to demonstrate the efficiency of our methods to search objects and control the robot movements <b>under</b> <b>vehicle.</b> We got excellent results not only by controlling the robot movement but also inspecting object by the robot camera at same time. This success allowed us to know the requirement to construct a new cost effective robot with more functionality.

In this chapter, {{we address}} {{the topic of}} {{building}} multi-perspective mosaics of infrared and color video data acquired by moving cameras under the constraints of small and large motion parallaxes.

For the <b>under</b> <b>vehicle</b> sequences, the goal is to create a large, high-resolution mosaic that may used to quickly inspect the entire scene shot by a camera making a single pass underneath the vehicle.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a disturbance acceleration adaptive estimate and correction approach for an attitude reference system (ARS) {{so as to}} improve the attitude estimate precision <b>under</b> <b>vehicle</b> movement conditions. The proposed approach depends on a Kalman filter, where the attitude error, the gyroscope zero offset error and the disturbance acceleration error are estimated. By switching the filter decay coefficient of the disturbance acceleration model in different acceleration modes, the disturbance acceleration is adaptively estimated and corrected, and then the attitude estimate precision is improved. The filter was tested in three different disturbance acceleration modes (non-acceleration, vibration-acceleration and sustained-acceleration mode, respectively) by digital simulation. Moreover, the proposed approach was tested in a kinematic vehicle experiment as well. Using the designed simulations and kinematic vehicle experiments, {{it has been shown}} that the disturbance acceleration of each mode can be accurately estimated and corrected. Moreover, compared with the complementary filter, the experimental results have explicitly demonstrated the proposed approach further improves the attitude estimate precision <b>under</b> <b>vehicle</b> movement conditions...|$|R
40|$|The pile-anchor {{supporting}} structure {{is widely used}} in foundation pit engineering; then knowledge of active earth pressure on piles {{is very important for}} engineers. In this paper, based on the pseudodynamic method and considering the vehicle’s vibration characteristic, a method to calculate the earth pressure on piles <b>under</b> <b>vehicle</b> load is presented. At the same time, the constraint of anchor is simplified relation of lateral deformation of piles in present method. Effects {{of a wide range of}} parameters like rupture angle, vibration acceleration coefficient, wall friction angle, and soil friction angle on active earth pressure have been studied. Results are presented in terms of coefficients in the figures and comparison of the test data and the earth pressure calculated by M-O method and present study. The result shows that the measured earth pressure is accordant with the theoretical analysis, so the method in this paper is an effective basis for the calculation of earth pressure on piles <b>under</b> <b>vehicle</b> loads...|$|R

40|$|Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) {{maintains}} {{autonomy for}} mobile robots {{and it has}} been studied extensively during the last two decades. It is the process of building the map of an unknown environment and determining the location of the robot using this map concurrently. Different kinds of sensors such as Global Positioning System (GPS), Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), laser range finder and sonar are used for data acquisition in SLAM. In recent years, passive visual sensors are utilized in visual SLAM (vSLAM) problem because of their increasing ubiquity. This thesis is concerned with the metric and appearance-based vSLAM problems for mobile robots. From {{the point of view of}} metric-based vSLAM, a performance improvement technique is developed. Template matching based video stabilization and Harris corner detector are integrated. Extracting Harris corner features from stabilized video consistently increases the accuracy of the localization. Data coming from a video camera and odometry are fused in an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to determine the pose of the robot and build the map of the environment. Simulation results validate the performance improvement obtained by the proposed technique. Moreover, a visual perception system is proposed for appearance-based vSLAM and used for <b>under</b> <b>vehicle</b> classification. The proposed system consists of three main parts: monitoring, detection and classification. In the first part a new catadioptric camera system, where a perspective camera points downwards to a convex mirror mounted to the body of a mobile robot, is designed. Thanks to the catadioptric mirror the scenes against the camera optical axis direction can be viewed. In the second part speeded up robust features (SURF) are used to detect the hidden objects that are <b>under</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Fast appearance based mapping algorithm (FAB-MAP) is then exploited for the classification of the means of transportations in the third part. Experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed system. The proposed solution is implemented using a non-holonomic mobile robot. In the implementations the bottom of the tables in the laboratory are considered as the <b>under</b> <b>vehicles.</b> A database that includes di erent <b>under</b> <b>vehicle</b> images is used.
