Indiana completed its portion of the freeway in 1998, while Michigan has opened its last segment in 2003. Further plans, if completed, would extend the freeway from the current end to the north. The <b>ultimate</b> <b>end</b> will either be at the interchange between Interstate 196 (I-196) and I-94 as originally planned, or another interchange immediately to the southwest. Environmental and other issues have forced a re-evaluation of the original 1981 plans for the northern end of the freeway.|$|E

25|$|Many archaeologists {{believe that}} the {{eruption}} triggered a crisis, making the Minoans vulnerable to conquest by the Mycenaeans. According to Sinclair Hood, the Minoans were most likely conquered by an invading force. Although the civilization's collapse was aided by the Thera eruption, its <b>ultimate</b> <b>end</b> came from conquest. Archaeological {{evidence suggests that the}} island was destroyed by fire, with the palace at Knossos receiving less damage than other sites on Crete. Since natural disasters are not selective, the uneven destruction was probably caused by invaders who would have seen the usefulness of preserving a palace like Knossos for their own use. Several authors have noted evidence that Minoan civilization had exceeded its environmental carrying capacity, with archaeological recovery at Knossos indicating deforestation in the region near the civilization's later stages.|$|E
25|$|The ideological {{basis for}} fascism {{came from a}} number of sources. Mussolini {{utilized}} works of Plato, Georges Sorel, Nietzsche, and the economic ideas of Vilfredo Pareto, to develop fascism. Mussolini admired Plato's The Republic, which he often read for inspiration. The Republic expounded a number of ideas that fascism promoted, such as rule by an elite promoting the state as the <b>ultimate</b> <b>end,</b> opposition to democracy, protecting the class system and promoting class collaboration, rejection of egalitarianism, promoting the militarization of a nation by creating a class of warriors, demanding that citizens perform civic duties {{in the interest of the}} state, and utilizing state intervention in education to promote the development of warriors and future rulers of the state. The Republic differed from fascism in that it did not promote aggressive war, but only defensive war. Also unlike fascism, it promoted very communist-like views on property. Plato was an idealist, focused on achieving justice and morality, while Mussolini and fascism were realist, focused on achieving political goals.|$|E

This is no mere breakup. It's the demolition of a marital covenant. So no matter how bad things were in her relationship, no matter how much better she feels now, no matter how cathartic the pulsing beats (courtesy of hitmeisters Max Martin and Dr. Luke) might feel, the <b>ultimate</b> <b>end</b> here is a very sad one indeed."

The sentiment, as ever, is punch you in face crystal clear and probably meant something to one of the (probably) 17 writers who wrote the song.

While noting the minimal characterization of Diabolik himself (describing him as [...] "the final distillation {{of the idea that}} we love criminals because we secretly admire the transgressions they represent"), he felt that Marisa Mell's portrayal of Eva presented her as loving Diabolik [...] "on a romantic plane of surprising believability.

[...] Erickson also admired Terry-Thomas' campy portrayal of the Minister of Interior, describing his news conference as [...] "easily outdo TV's Batman."

40|$|ABSTRACT Modern {{politics}} dogmatically separates {{politics from}} religion, {{the state from}} promises of salvation. This article makes a case for the fundamentally political nature of transcendence. It argues that the changing relationships between authority and salvation depend on culturally crafted engagements of the spiritual and the temporal. In a fi rst part, I examine four key confi gurations of the political {{in the history of}} the West, which can be grasped as extraordinary form of “absolute ” politics. From the adoption of Christianity by Constantine, the Gregorian reform, Luther’s Reformation, and the French Revolution, secular forms of territorial power are grounded in an engagement between the spiritual and the temporal. In a second part, I show how <b>ultimate</b> <b>ends</b> infl uenced the emergence of secular forms of power.
