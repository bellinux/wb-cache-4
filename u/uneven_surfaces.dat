5|$|Xerocomellus zelleri, {{commonly}} known as Zeller's Bolete, is an edible species of mushroom in the family Boletaceae. First described scientifically by American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill in 1912, the species has been juggled by various authors to several genera, including Boletus, Boletellus, and Xerocomus. Found solely in western North America from British Columbia south to Mexico, the fruit bodies are distinguished by their dark reddish brown to nearly black caps with <b>uneven</b> <b>surfaces,</b> the yellow pores {{on the underside of}} the caps, and the red-streaked yellow stems. The fungus grows in summer and autumn on the ground, often in Douglas fir forests or on their margins. The development of the fruit bodies is gymnocarpic, meaning that the hymenium appears and develops to maturity in an exposed state, not enclosed by any protective membrane.|$|E

25|$|In humans, {{the distal}} pads are wider {{than in other}} {{primates}} because the soft tissues of the finger tip are attached to a horseshoe-shaped edge on the underlying bone, and, in the grasping hand, the distal pads can therefore conform to <b>uneven</b> <b>surfaces</b> while pressure is distributed more evenly in the finger tips. The distal pad of the human thumb is divided into a proximal and a distal compartment, the former more deformable than the latter, which allows the thumb pad to mold around an object.|$|E

40|$|Objectives. To {{examine the}} effect of using a common peroneal {{stimulator}} on an even and an <b>uneven</b> <b>surface,</b> and to compare measures with perceived response to stimulation. Method. Participants had a drop-foot caused by a stroke (N = 13) or multiple sclerosis (N = 7) and had used a common peroneal stimulator for > 3 months prior to the study. Walking speed and physiological cost index (PCI) were recorded under four conditions: with and without stimulation over an even and an <b>uneven</b> <b>surface.</b> Participants also completed a questionnaire. Results. A statistically significant increase in walking speed and decrease in PCI was identified when the stimulator was used. There was a trend to greater improvement on the uneven compared to the even surface. A correlation between perceived benefit of stimulation and a measured decrease in PCI was detected. Conclusion. Stimulation may be particularly beneficial for the more difficult task of walking on an <b>uneven</b> <b>surface.</b> Perceived benefit was related to a reduction in effort of walking, not in increased speed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This study {{reports the}} {{preparation}} of soft magnetic ribbons of Fe-based amorphous alloys using the single-roller melt-spinning technique. Ribbon width varied from 142 mm to 213 mm and, with a thickness of approximately 22 μm � 2 μm. The microstructure and magnetic properties of the ribbons were characterized by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), and electrical resistivity measurements (ERM). The amorphous material properties dependence of the cooling rate and nozzle pressure have <b>uneven</b> <b>surface</b> in ribbon thicknesses are investigated. Magnetic measurement results indicate that some region of the ribbon exhibits good magnetic properties, higher saturation induction and lower coercivity. However, due to the <b>uneven</b> <b>surface</b> of 213 mm wide ribbon, the magnetic responses are not uniformly distributed. To understand the transformer magnetic performances, this study analyzes the measurements of a three-phase 2 MVA amorphous-cored transformer. Experimental results confirm that the transformer with a ribbon width of 142 mm has better magnetic properties in terms of lower core loss, exciting power, and audible noise.

25|$|Chrysopelea ornata is diurnal and arboreal. The snake's gliding ability, {{while not}} as {{impressive}} {{as that of the}} paradise flying snake (C. paradisi), still makes it capable of moving from tree to tree with relative ease. These snakes are excellent climbers, being able move across even the smallest of branches and even straight up trees with few branches by using the edges of rough bark. They are frequently seen moving up a coconut palm, or up vertical rock faces in graceful curves, gripping the somewhat <b>uneven</b> <b>surfaces</b> with their scales. They tend to be nervous, fast-moving snakes, and will attempt to flee if disturbed, but will not generally hesitate to bite if handled. They are mildly venomous, but the venom is not considered to be dangerous to humans. It is intended to assist in subduing fast moving, arboreal prey.|$|E
25|$|Domesticated {{horses are}} also subject to {{inconsistent}} movement between stabling and work; they must carry or pull additional weight, and in modern times, {{they are often}} kept and worked on very soft footing, such as irrigated land, arena footing, or stall bedding. In some cases, management is also inadequate. The hooves of horses that are kept in stalls or small turnouts, even when cleaned adequately, are exposed to more moisture than would be encountered in the wild, {{as well as to}} ammonia from urine. The hoof capsule is mostly made from keratin, a protein, and is weakened by this exposure, becoming even more fragile and soft. Shoes do not prevent or reduce damage from moisture and ammonia exposure. Rather, they protect already weakened hooves. Further, without the natural conditioning factors present in the wild, the feet of horses grow overly large and long unless trimmed regularly. Hence, protection from rocks, pebbles, and hard, <b>uneven</b> <b>surfaces</b> is lacking. A balanced diet with proper nutrition also is a factor. Without these precautions, cracks in overgrown and overly brittle hoof walls are a danger, as is bruising of the soft tissues within the foot because of inadequately thick and hard sole material.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- A {{solution}} {{is presented to}} the robust control problem of wheeled mobile robots moving on an <b>uneven</b> <b>surface</b> that is not exactly known. Quadratic surface with unknown but bounded coefficients is utilized to locally approximate the <b>uneven</b> <b>surface.</b> The design procedure {{is based on the}} transverse function method, integrator backstepping, and Lyapunov redesign technique. After exploring the left-invariance property of the kinematic subsystem of the wheeled mobile robots with respect to the standard group operation of the Lie group SE(2), we use transverse function to derive smooth “virtual ” control laws which render the error subsystem exponentially stable. Then, the integrator backstepping technique is applied to the nominal dynamic system due to the smoothness of the “virtual ” control laws. Finally, a Lyapunov redesign component is constructed to handle the gravity disturbance caused by the surface. Driven by the proposed control laws, the wheeled mobile robot has the ability to adapt to varying <b>uneven</b> <b>surface</b> condition. Some simulations are provided to validate the effectiveness of the algorithm. Index Terms- Wheeled mobile robots. Lie group. Transverse function. Backstepping. Robust stabilization. I...|$|R

500|$|On 14 March 1895, {{after two}} false starts {{and with the}} ship's {{position}} at 84°4′N, Nansen and Johansen began their journey.

However, <b>uneven</b> <b>surfaces</b> made skiing more difficult, and their speeds slowed. They also realised that they were marching against a southerly drift, and that distances travelled did not necessarily equate to northerly progression. On 3 April Nansen began to wonder whether the pole was, indeed, attainable. Unless their speed improved, their food would not last them to the pole and then on to Franz Josef Land. He confided in his diary: [...] "I have become more and more convinced we ought to turn before time." [...] On 7 April, after making camp and observing that the way ahead was [...] "a veritable chaos of iceblocks stretching as far as the horizon", Nansen decided to turn south. He recorded the latitude of the final northerly camp as 86°13.6′N, almost three degrees beyond the previous Farthest North mark.|$|E
500|$|Ember Ridge, a {{mountain}} ridge between Tricouni Peak and Mount Fee, consists {{of at least}} eight lava domes composed of andesite.
