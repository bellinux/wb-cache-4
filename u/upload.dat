The aim of this thesis was to improve the amount {{of published}} material about designing graphical user interfaces for integrated video <b>uploading</b> services.

The prototype used some of the found guidelines from the literature study as well as some of the design choices found in the analysis of the dedicated video <b>uploading</b> services. The prototype was evaluated with test persons to determine if used design guidelines had a positive impact. The phases was completed successfully and the result of the evaluation indicate that almost all of the used guidelines had a positive effect when used in designing integrated video <b>uploading</b> services...|$|R
