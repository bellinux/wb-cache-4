40|$|This work {{concentrated}} on the machined surface properties produced by the multi-axis ball-end milling process {{in order to enhance}} the high-performance application of multiaxis ball-end milling technology. The cutting speed of the engaged cutting edges and machining characteristics under various inclination angles were analyzed. The effects of inclination angles on the machined surface hardness, residual stresses, surface textures, topographies, and roughness were investigated under <b>up-milling</b> and down-milling conditions. Under <b>up-milling</b> condition, the machined surface hardness with regard to various tilt angles are larger than the ones under corresponding lead angles, and the variations of surface hardness with increasing lead angles are not apparent. In down-milling condition, double-peaks shape appears in the changing curve of surface hardness with increasing tilt and lead angles. The residual stresses present the overall trend of firstly increasing, then decreasing, and finally increasing with the increasing tilt angle from - 45 to 45 degrees. The surface residual stresses in both feed and cross-feed directions firstly decrease, and then increase with the increasing lead angle. Under both <b>up-milling</b> and down-milling, the compressive residual stresses significantly appear at the tool inclination angles near 0 degrees due to extrusion action of the cutting edges close to tool tip and the low effective cutting speed. For down-milling condition, the surface textures are approximately parallel with the feed direction when using tilt angles with large values, and are approximately perpendicular to feed direction under varying lead angles. The apparent machining marks under negative tilt angles with relatively larger absolute values and obvious regular surface patterns corresponding to positive tilt angles could be observed. More surface pits and burrs and circular arc textures probably appear under small tilt angles and lead angles near 0 degrees...|$|E
40|$|The {{temperature}} on {{the rake}} face of a binder-less cBN tool tip in end-milling was measured using a fiber-optic two-color pyrometer. The radiation of the interface between the tool tip and the chip is transmitted through the binder-less cBN and accepted by the optical fiber located behind the tool tip. The radiation accepted is transmitted to a two-color detector, which consists of a InAs and InSb detector, through a rotary fiber coupler. The coupler {{makes it possible to}} transmit the radiation outside the milling machine. The fundamental transmission characteristics of the coupler was investigated theoretically and experimentally. This method was found to be very practical to measure the tool tip temperature in end-milling. The results obtained are as follows. The rake face temperature in the <b>up-milling</b> of 0. 55 % carbon steel ranged from 480 degrees centigrade to 560 degrees centigrade for the cutting speeds of 2. 2 m/s to 4. 4 m/s.

For this aim paulownia logs were provided and were converted to proper sizes (2. 5 x 10 x 15 cm) and then air dried. The Variable of this study were cutting speed (8. 37 and 15. 07 m/s), feeding rate (6 and 12 m/min), cutting depth (1 and 5 mm), cutting method (down and <b>up-milling)</b> and cutting pattern (tangential and radial). Roughness of cut specimens edge were evaluated by profilometer method according to ISO 13565 standard. For evaluation of surface quality, average roughness (Ra), maximum roughness (R max), valley roughness (Rv) and peak roughness (Rp) were used. Degrees of effectiveness of the parameters were evaluated by fractional factorial design as completely random design at confidence level of 95 %.

30|$|For {{peripheral}} planing, the ANOVA {{showed that}} glueline shear strength and percent wood failure {{were affected by}} the interaction between feed speed and accelerated aging treatment. Table  4 shows that planing wood with wavelengths up to 1.9  mm produced surfaces with the best glueline shear strength for the unaged samples. Equally, planing with wavelengths up to 3.1  mm generated wood surfaces with similar glueline shear strength for the aged samples. However, glueline shear strength was significantly reduced when planing at 6.5 of wavelength for both conditions (unaged and aged samples). It is therefore demonstrated that glueline shear strength decreased with increasing feed speed for the unaged and aged specimens. Moreover, percent wood failure increased slightly as feed speed increased, especially for aged specimens (Table  4). During <b>up-milling,</b> as wavelength increases, direction of the resulting cutting forces will change from a pushing action to a pulling action [38]. This should increase surface roughness (as shown previously) and also produce more cellular damage, especially micro-ruptures formed between and within cells. These micro-ruptures would develop deeper during the aging treatment, which could increase the percent wood failure.|$|E

The material characteristics such as strain rate sensitivity, strain hardening and thermal softening are considered. In the primary shear zone, thermomechanical coupling and inertia effects are accounted for. Due {{to the fact that the}} reference frame associated to the primary shear zone moves with the tool rotation, an analysis of the inertial effects has been performed. As the heat conductivity of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V is low, the thermomechanical process of chip formation is supposed to be adiabatic; thus, the problem equations are reduced to a system of two non-linear equations which are solved numerically by combining the Newton-Raphson method and Gaussian quadrature. The present analytical approach leads to a three-dimensional cutting force model for end milling operations. Calculated and experimental results extracted from the literature are compared for several operations: full immersion, <b>up-milling</b> and down-milling and for different cutting conditions. Although the present model was established for stationary conditions and for continuous chips, it gives acceptable predictions for machining titanium alloy for which the chips are usually segmented.

During the milling process, the wear of the nose width was smallest for the tool with a sharpness angle of 45 °, followed by tools with sharpness angles of 55 ° and 65 °. The wear of edge recession was highest for the tool with a sharpness angle of 45 °, followed by tools with sharpness angles of 55 ° and 65 °. The nose width increased with increasing sharpness angle, the edge recession decreased with increasing sharpness angle, and the machined surface roughness increased with increasing sharpness angle after a feeding length of 40 m. The nose width had a positive effect on the machined surface roughness, and the machined surface roughness increased with increasing nose width. The edge recession had little effect on the machined surface roughness. The clearance face roughness of the worn tool increased with increasing sharpness angle. The analysis of the SEM micrographs and EDS of the clearance face of the worn tool showed that the wear mechanisms of the cemented tungsten carbide tool were oxidation and abrasion in the range tested during cutting.

While there is some loss in surface porosity, in comparison to cutting uninfiltrated CPP, the porosity loss was deemed acceptable for the clinical purpose of the implant, and in many cases, would be trimmed off during a consecutive finish machining operation. The 2 fluted 4 mm diameter flat end mill at a cutting speed of 30 m/min and ¾ immersion <b>up-milling,</b> 0. 1 mm chip load and 3 mm depth of cut were determined to be highly suitable for achieving both high productivity as well as excellent surface integrity.

The constructed machining model was highly successful in predicting the cutting forces, and therefore can be used in process planning and optimization in the production of tissue engineered implant constructs out of CPP. The Finite Element analyses predicted that the implant would not chip or break during the roughing operation, as validated experimentally.
