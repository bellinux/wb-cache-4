40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{to study}} the risk of cancer, {{particularly}} of lung cancer and bladder cancer, among workers in the printing industry according to different occupations.  METHODS—This is a population based retrospective cohort study. The cohort comprised 1332  men and 426  women employed in the printing industry in Iceland according to a published <b>union</b> <b>registry.</b> A computerised file of the cohort was record linked to the Cancer Registry by making use of personal identification numbers. Expected numbers of cases of cancer were calculated {{on the basis of}} number of person-years and specific incidences of cancer sites for men and women provided by the Cancer Registry.  RESULTS—Among the men (36   217. 5 person-years at risk) there were 125  observed cancers versus 123. 66  expected, standardised incidence ratio (SIR) 1. 01,  95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) was 0. 84  to 1. 20.  The SIR (95 % CI) for liver cancer was 1. 97  (0. 55  to 5. 20) and the SIR for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was 2. 26  (0. 96  to 4. 41). No excess risk for cancer was found among women (8631. 0  person-years at risk). The SIR (95 % CI) for liver cancer was 4. 21  (0. 47  to 15. 20) and for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma it was 4. 99  (1. 61  to 11. 63) among the typesetters. A survey on smoking habits among active and retired union members showed that they smoked less than a random sample of the general population.  CONCLUSION—The cancer site most often reported to show excess risk among printing industry workers has been the lung and the urinary bladder; however, this was not found in the present study. This may be explained by difference in smoking habits among union members compared with the general population. There is a high occurrence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, particularly among typesetters, which warrants further studies.    Keywords: printing industry; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; smoking habit...|$|E

5000|$|As of 2015, {{more than}} 250 {{municipalities}} and cities throughout Italy have introduced civil <b>union</b> <b>registries</b> (registro delle unioni civili) which formally recognise same-sex couples. These registers mostly have a symbolic value {{and are not}} legally binding, even though {{in some cases they}} offer very limited local benefits. Major cities which offer civil <b>union</b> <b>registries</b> include Rome, Bologna, Padua, Florence, Pisa, Bolzano, Palermo, Naples, Milan and Genoa.|$|R

The popular perception of the British Civil Service is played up, with registering as a [...] "Temp" [...] being strangely similar to applying for Jobseeker's Allowance or other benefits. The two books were Temps (1991) and EuroTemps (1992).|$|R
50|$|On 25 February 2016, {{the bill}} was {{approved}} by the Italian Senate in a 173-71 vote. The law provides same-sex couples with most of the rights of marriage except parenting (stepchild or joint adoption) and reproductive rights (IVF for lesbian couples). The bill passed to the Chamber of Deputies where a vote was expected no earlier than mid-May. On 8 March, the Justice Committee of the Chamber of Deputies started discussing the bill. During the nocturnal session of 19-20 April, the Committee sent the bill to the floor for the general debate. On 27 April, House parties' speakers decided to start the debate on 9 May and to end it on 12 May. On 11 May, the Chamber of Deputies approved the bill by 372 to 51 votes in favour, with 99 abstentions. It was subsequently signed by President Sergio Mattarella on 20 May. The law was published in the official gazette on 21 May and took effect on 5 June 2016. On 21 July, the Italian Council of State approved a government decree setting civil <b>union</b> <b>registries</b> across the country, allowing the first civil unions to be registered in Italy in the upcoming days. On 24 July, the first same-sex couple entered into a civil union, in Castel San Pietro Terme, near Bologna.|$|R

40|$|Objectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to review the {{available}} evidence on TNF inhibitor monotherapy vs combination therapy with MTX in PsA. Methods. A literature search was conducted up to and including October 2013 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing TNF inhibitor monotherapy vs combination therapy with MTX in patients with PsA. Key information was extracted from the abstracts and/or full text of the articles retrieved. Results. Eleven published articles and three conference abstracts were retrieved, reporting on six RCTs of four TNF inhibitors. Most RCTs found no differences in efficacy for peripheral arthritis between patients treated with or without MTX. However, the studies were not powered to answer this question. Some data suggest that concomitant MTX may reduce the progression of structural damage. No significant differences in other outcomes have been reported. Data on TNF inhibitor monotherapy vs MTX combination therapy were reported from six registries. Three registries reported that the use of concomitant MTX did not affect the efficacy of TNF inhibitor therapy. Data from three European <b>Union</b> <b>registries</b> suggest that TNF inhibitor (especially mAbs) drug survival is superior in patients taking concomitant MTX, while one Canadian registry reported no difference. Conclusion. Available evidence on the efficacy and safety of TNF inhibitor monotherapy vs add-on MTX therapy shows little or no improvement with combination therapy, although the use of concomitant MTX appears to prolong TNF inhibitor drug survival of mAb TNF inhibitors. Registries and observational studies have the potential to fill some of the knowledge gaps in this area...|$|R
5000|$|The Credit Unions Act 1979 for {{the first}} time {{regulated}} credit unions in the UK. The Act required that all credit unions in Scotland, Wales and England register with the Registrar of Friendly Societies, who was responsible for ensuring that credit unions had a [...] "satisfactory" [...] common bond and adhered to common set of rules. The registrar was tasked with monitoring the activities of credit unions, who had to submit quarterly and annual returns to the registrar. The Act allowed the registrar to suspend a credit union's operations, strike credit <b>unions</b> off the <b>registry</b> and prosecute illegal financial activity by a credit union. In the years immediately following the passing of the Act, the number of credit unions increased significantly. In 1982, 73 credit unions were registered. From the late 1980s to early 1990s the registration of credit unions surged, increasing fourfold between 1987 and 1994. Between 1994 and 2000 a large number of small credit unions closed or merged with other credit unions. In 2000, 660 credit unions were regarded officially registered. A further 220 credit unions had failed to submitted their annual return to the Registrar.|$|R
40|$|The {{aims of the}} Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBR) are {{research}} as well as health management. By the establishment of MBR in 1967 we got {{a unique opportunity to}} study birth outcomes related to occupational exposure during a long time period and within groups. It is a virtue that MBR has registered information on all births, however, a disadvantage is that information on early spontaneous abortions and waiting time to pregnancy are missing. MBR data were linked to occupational data from other sources in published epidemiological studies related to occupation. Such sources are occupational cohorts, lists from labour <b>unions</b> and public <b>registries</b> as agricultural and horticultural censuses and population censuses. The former studies are reviewed, focusing on the definition of occupation and occupational exposure. We discuss challenges in future occupational epidemiological studies and point out some future challenges and ways to improve quality and validity. We have further emphasised on potentials in occupational epidemiology using MBR, as well as on sources where occupation and occupational exposures can be found, geneworking environment interaction studies and studies where we allow for grandmothers’ working environment as well. In spite of problems attached, in Norway we have the possibilities to carry out such studies due to expansion of Norwegian systems of surveillance, and since the knowledge in biotechnology internationally is growing. This, in addition to extensive co-operation between the Nordic countries may be a useful approach in future studies...|$|R
40|$|Medisinsk fødselsregister (MFR) har både helseforskning og helseforvaltning som formål. Ved etableringen av MFR i 1967 fikk vi i Norge en unik mulighet til å studere fødselsutfall knyttet til yrket, over lang tid og i spesielt eksponerte grupper. Det er en styrke at MFR inneholder informasjon om alle fødte, men en ulempe at blant annet opplysninger om spontanaborter og ventetid til graviditet mangler. Tidligere yrkesepidemiologiske studier har vært gjennomført ved å koble MFR-data til yrkesdata fra andre kilder som yrkeskohorter, fagforeningslister, og offentlige {{registre}} som Landbrukstellinger og Folke- og boligtellinger. Vi har gitt en oversikt over studier med fokus på definisjon av yrke- og yrkeseksponering. Vi avslutter med å se på utfordringer ved fremtidige yrkesepidemiologiske studier, muligheter for å øke kvalitet og validitet, samt å peke på fremtidsmuligheter som ligger i yrkesepidemiologi ved bruk av MFR. Vi fokuserer spesielt på kilder der yrkes- og yrkeseksponerings-data kan finnes, men også på studier der opplysninger om genetikk kobles mot arbeidsmiljø, samt studier med opplysninger fra bestemødrenes arbeidsmiljø. Til tross for problemer knyttet til slike studier, har vi i Norge gode muligheter til å gjennomføre dem siden norske overvåkningssystemer er i stadig utvikling og bioteknologisk kunnskap internasjonalt er økende. Dette i tillegg til et utstrakt samarbeid mellom de nordiske land, kan være veien å gå. The {{aims of the}} Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBR) are {{research as}} well as health management.
