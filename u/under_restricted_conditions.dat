25|$|Marriage customs vary in Muslim {{dominated}} countries. Islamic {{law allows}} polygamy where a Muslim man can {{be married to}} four wives at the same time, <b>under</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>conditions,</b> {{but it is not}} widespread. As the Sharia demands that polygamous men treat all wives equally, classical Islamic scholars opined that it is preferable to avoid polygamy altogether, so one does not even come near the chance of committing the forbidden deed of dealing unjustly between the wives. Most modern Muslims view the practice of polygamy as allowed, but unusual and not recommended. In some countries, polygamy is restricted by new family codes, for example the Moudawwana in Morocco. Some countries allow Muslim men to enter into additional temporary marriages, beyond the four allowed marriages, such as the practice of sigheh marriages in Iran, and Nikah Mut'ah elsewhere in some Middle East countries.|$|E

50|$|It was {{announced}} in May 2009 that TAAG had passed IATA inspections. In , TAAG received permission to operate flights to Europe <b>under</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>conditions,</b> as it was allowed to fly only into Portugal and using only its three Boeing 777s. This partial lift of the ban made TAAG the only Angolan airline that was permitted to operate into the EU. After nearly two years of being banned from EU airspace, TAAG deployed its own aircraft on the European corridor immediately. TAAG then returned the Boeing 747-400 to South African Airways. In November 2009, the European Commission extended the permission to TAAG's four Boeing 737-700s. Also in November 2009, TAAG restarted services to Havana; many Cuban doctors and teachers reside in Angola and the flight exists to help transport them. In late March 2010, restrictions over TAAG operations were relaxed again following the announcement the airline could fly its Boeing 777-200ERs and 737-700s to all European airports.|$|E
