40|$|In a {{stalking}} scenario, {{the prior}} relationship between and {{the gender of}} stalker and victim were systematically manipulated in order to judge culpability and consequences for the persons involved. Written vignettes were presented to 168 participants who responded via seven Likert scales. Stalker-victim <b>relationship</b> <b>had</b> <b>three</b> levels: ex-partner, acquaintance and stranger. In accordance with the 'Just World' hypothesis (Lerner, 1980), the victim was judged as having greater responsibility for the stalking when their harasser was an ex-partner or a prior acquaintance rather than a stranger, and police intervention was felt to be most necessary when the stalker was a stranger. Sex of stalker and victim was manipulated, and the following comparisons proved significant: when the perpetrator was male, bodily injury to the victim was seen as more likely and police intervention as more necessary than when the perpetrator was female; and male victims were viewed as more responsible for the scenario and as possessing greater powers to alleviate it. The Just World hypothesis and gender stereotypes provide a plausible account for these findings. Future research should determine whether criminal convictions show similar biases towards convicting male and stranger stalkers more often than female and ex-partner stalkers. 1426...|$|R

Second, I construct alternative measures of time-varying inflation uncertainty for these countries, using actual inflation data and survey expectations. I discuss some possible determinants of inflation uncertainty. Finally, I use panel data methods to investigate the relationship between term premium estimates and inflation uncertainty measures, and find a strong positive relationship. The economic determinants of term premia remain mysterious; but this evidence points to uncertainty about intermediate- to long-run inflation rates being {{a substantial part of}} the explanation for why yield curves slope up.

40|$|Many {{bacterial}} species <b>have</b> established symbiotic <b>relationships</b> {{with higher}} eukaryotic organisms such as plants, animals or even humans. Wolbachia, an alpha-proteobacterium {{belonging to the}} Rickettsiales order, is an obligate intracellular and maternally inherited bacterium found in arthropods (especially insects) and nematodes. In insect hosts, Wolbachia is characterized as a reproductive parasite which can cause cytoplasmic incompatibility, parthenogenesis, feminization and male killing. Recent studies indicate that hundred thousands of insect species, the most speciose animal phylum, harbor these bacteria, making it the most abundant intracellular bacterium on the planet. Studies of Wolbachia symbiotic <b>relationships</b> <b>have</b> <b>three</b> main goals: (a) to study the ecological success of this bacterium as exemplified by the wide spectrum of hosts, (b) to study the contribution of Wolbachia to speciation processes (and, consequently, to biodiversity increase), and (c) to study the molecular mechanism underlying the reproductive alterations induced by Wolbachia, {{in order to develop}} environmentally friendly methods of pest control. This thesis focuses on the comparative study of Wolbachia genomes. In the second chapter, genes contained in the Wolbachia genome were studied. Most of the times, ORF prediction algorithms are trained using sequences that are not very appropriate for the prediction of phylogenetically distant species. In the framework of this thesis, it was found that use of sequences originating from closely related symbiotic bacteria, identifies genes that were not detected in the official annotation of the genome. In downstream experiments that followed, most of these genes were found to be expressed. Such genes may be specific to the symbiotic lifestyle and very possible take part in the host-symbiont interaction. However, since, they {{are not part of the}} official annotation, their biological significance remains unexplored. Chapter three describes a comparative study, using the Long PCR and CGH techniques, of genomes of closely related Wolbachia strains that nevertheless differ in the reproductive effects they have on their respective hosts. It was seen that, in contrast to all other bacteria, the divergence between the strains is fairly large, despite the close relatedness of the strains. This divergence was due to prophages and ankyrin genes, as well as the multitude of transposable elements found in the genome sequence of virtually each Wolbachia strain. The divergent genomic areas were identified and future analysis may show that some of them harbor genes participating in the expression of reproductive alterations caused by Wolbachia. ...|$|R
