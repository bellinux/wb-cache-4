25|$|Mussolini {{launched}} several public construction {{programs and}} government initiatives throughout Italy to combat economic setbacks or unemployment levels. His earliest (and {{one of the}} best known) was the Battle for Wheat, by which 5,000 new farms were established and five new agricultural towns (among them Littoria and Sabaudia) on land reclaimed by draining the Pontine Marshes. In Sardinia, a model agricultural town was founded and named Mussolinia, but has long since been renamed Arborea. This town was the first of what Mussolini hoped would have been thousands of new agricultural settlements across the country. The Battle for Wheat diverted valuable resources to wheat production away from other more economically viable crops. Landowners grew wheat on <b>unsuitable</b> <b>soil</b> using all the advances of modern science, and although the wheat harvest increased, prices rose, consumption fell and high tariffs were imposed. The tariffs promoted widespread inefficiencies and the government subsidies given to farmers pushed the country further into debt.|$|E

In the twenty-second century, however, {{the growth of the}} city storey above storey, and the coalescence of buildings, had led to a different arrangement. The prosperous people lived in a vast series of sumptuous hotels in the upper storeys and halls of the city fabric; the industrial population dwelt beneath in the tremendous ground-floor and basement, so to speak, of the place.|$|E

50|$|Population {{pressure}} also operates {{through other}} mechanisms. Improper agricultural practices, for instance, occur only under constraints {{such as the}} saturation of good lands under population pressure which leads settlers to cultivate too shallow or too steep soils, plough fallow land before it has recovered its fertility, or attempt to obtain multiple crops by irrigating <b>unsuitable</b> <b>soils.</b>|$|R
40|$|Different earth materials, such as {{soil and}} rock, {{are used in}} the {{construction}} of geotechnical systems including foundations, retaining walls, embankments and road pavements and air-field pavements. Often site soils are unacceptable for the intended function and must be replaced with better quality materials or improved. One method of improvement is to mix high quality site materials with lesser quality site materials to provide an acceptable soil material. In Iowa, materials for earthwork construction are classified, based on their suitability, as: select, suitable, and <b>unsuitable</b> <b>soils.</b> In this study, three <b>unsuitable</b> <b>soils</b> were mixed with one select soil at various proportions (unsuitable : select = 25 %: 75 %, 50 %: 50 % and 75 %: 25 %) to investigate how the engineering properties can be improved at different select-unsuitable ratios and evaluate the potential of using the blends at various embankment layers. Experimental results indicate that resulting blends are for the most part acceptable and classify as suitable materials for embankments. With the large amount of money involved in carrying out the remedial measures for poor soils, management and optimization of the available materials by mixing the materials among themselves in various proportions can be a viable solution...|$|R

5000|$|Permeable paving {{surfaces}} {{keep the}} pollutants {{in place in}} the soil or other material underlying the roadway, and allow water seepage to groundwater recharge while preventing the stream erosion problems. They capture the heavy metals that fall on them, preventing them from washing downstream and accumulating inadvertently in the environment. In the void spaces, naturally occurring micro-organisms digest car oils, leaving little but carbon dioxide and water. Rainwater infiltration is usually less than that of an impervious pavement with a separate stormwater management facility somewhere downstream[...]in areas where infiltration is not possible due to <b>unsuitable</b> <b>soil</b> conditions permeable pavements are used in the attenuation mode where water is retained in the pavement and slowly released to surface water systems between storm events.|$|E
50|$|For {{some time}} the waratah {{has had a}} {{reputation}} as difficult plant. It has a complex culture and for many years there have been cases of people trying to establish the plant only to have the attempt fail. Failures can usually be attributed to the effects of <b>unsuitable</b> <b>soil</b> conditions, aspect or climate. The waratah is also a slow plant to mature with a flowering period that is short, unpredictable and unreliable. Early issues with cultivation meant that approximately 90% of all waratahs sold at Sydney’s Flemington markets in the early 90s were bush picked. Some {{progress has been made in}} the 20 years since then with several cultivars being commercially grown mostly in areas to the North and South of Sydney and in the Dandenong Ranges in Victoria. Issues with cultivation are still present however.|$|E

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{forensic}} investigations of problems across Iowa, a research study was developed aimed at providing solutions to identified problems through better management and optimization of the available pavement geotechnical materials and through ground improvement, soil reinforcement, and other soil treatment techniques. The overall goal was worked out through simple laboratory experiments, such as particle size analysis, plasticity tests, compaction tests, permeability tests, and strength tests. A review of the problems suggested three areas of study: pavement cracking due to improper management of pavement geotechnical materials, permeability of mixed-subgrade soils, and settlement of soil above the pipe due to improper compaction of the backfill. This resulted in the following three areas of study: (1) The optimization and management of earthwork materials through general soil mixing of various select and <b>unsuitable</b> <b>soils</b> and a specific example of optimization of materials in earthwork construction by soil mixing; (2) An investigation of the saturated permeability of compacted glacial till in relation to validation and prediction with the Enhanced Integrated Climatic Model (EICM); and (3) A field investigation and numerical modeling of culvert settlement. For each area of study, a literature review was conducted, research data were collected and analyzed, and important findings and conclusions were drawn. It was found that optimum mixtures of select and <b>unsuitable</b> <b>soils</b> can be defined that allow the use of unsuitable materials in embankment and subgrade locations. An improved model of saturated hydraulic conductivity was proposed for use with glacial soils from Iowa.

50|$|The {{original}} tomb was {{in constant}} {{need of repair}} and deteriorated significantly due to construction on <b>unsuitable</b> <b>soil.</b> In 1900, a complete reconstruction of Lincoln's tomb was undertaken, and the Lincolns' remains were exhumed, before Lincoln was finally placed back in the white marble sarcophagus that Mullen and Hughes had opened so easily in 1876. In April 25, 1901, {{upon completion of the}} reconstruction, Robert Todd Lincoln visited the tomb. He was unhappy with the disposition of his father's remains and decided that it was necessary to build a permanent crypt for his father. Lincoln's coffin would be placed in a steel cage 10 ft deep and encased in concrete in the floor of the tomb. On September 26, 1901, Lincoln's body was exhumed so that it could be re-interred in the newly built crypt. However, those present (a total of 23 people) feared that his body might have been stolen in the intervening years, so they decided to open the coffin and check.|$|E
50|$|The {{site of the}} Barra Olympic Park was {{formerly}} occupied by the Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet, also known as Jacarepaguá. It was a former Formula One circuit that hosted the Brazilian Grand Prix {{on a number of}} occasions throughout the 1980s, before the Grand Prix went back to its original home at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace, Interlagos, in 1990. Jacarepaguá was partly demolished to make way for the City of Sports Complex, a cluster of three venues constructed for the 2007 Pan American Games, held in Rio de Janeiro. The venues consisted the Maria Lenk Aquatic Center, which held diving, swimming and synchronized swimming events, the Rio Olympic Arena, which held basketball and artistic gymnastics events, and the Barra Velodrome, which held track cycling and speed roller skating events. Construction of the City of Sports was not without setbacks - the original plan for the complex called for a large-scale entertainment complex, valued at R$ 500 million and contracted to private firms for construction. These plans, however, fell through, and a smaller-scale plan for the complex was adopted instead. Opposition efforts by preservationists of the Jacarepaguá, the <b>unsuitable</b> <b>soil</b> at the construction site and numerous strike actions by workers delayed the venue's construction, which initially planned to begin in 2005, but was delayed until mid-2006. Despite these challenges, the venues were completed in time for the games in July 2007, and cost a relatively cheaper R$ 205 million to construct, with venues smaller than originally planned.|$|E
40|$|Changes in {{land use}} in the Netherlands are {{anticipated}} on a large scale. Soil quality, however, hardly {{plays a role in}} spatial planning, which was reason enough to analyse the relationship between land use and soil quality on a national scale using ecological data. Despite major changes in land use, the strong linkage between land use and soil type was seen to continue. Soil management practices, historical land use and the geographical situation influence the relationship between land use and soil properties; the influence of land use on several soil properties is also discernable. Thus soil biodiversity can be said to be influenced by farming intensity. Land use is not always situated in areas where benefits in terms of yield are high. Less than 20 % of the arable farming and pasture is situated on <b>unsuitable</b> <b>soil,</b> whereas over 40 % of the forests grow on <b>unsuitable</b> <b>soil.</b> Region-specific environmental policy offers many possibilities for differentiation according to land use. It is also possible to match occurring soil quality to both existing and desired land use...|$|E
40|$|Although not an {{alternative}} to all <b>unsuitable</b> <b>soils,</b> the low-pressure pipe (LPP) system {{has proven to be}} useful for some specific conditions, where conventional systems frequently fail. Less than one-third of the land area in the U. S. has soil conditions suitable for conventional soil absorption systems. Numerous innovative alternatives to the conventional septic tank soil absorption system have evolved in response to the demand for an environmentally acceptable and economical means of disposing domestic wastewater onsite and contending with the restrictive soil conditions common in many states. Originating in North Carolina and Wisconsin, a LPP system is a shallow, pressure-dosed soil absorption system with a network of small diameter perforated pipes placed 25. 4 to 45. 7 cm (10 to 18 inches) deep in narrow trenches, 30. 5 to 45. 7 cm (12 to 18 inches) wide.

40|$|The {{septic tank}} sewage {{disposal}} system {{was developed to}} provide waste disposal for rural residents. For this purpose the properly installed system performed quite well. It allowed the most remote rural residents to enjoy the conveniences of indoor plumbing. However, over the last twenty-five years population shifts in the United States occasioned improper use of septic tank systems. Population has become concentrated into urban areas (TJCOG, 1980). Many housing lots of residential sections now urban were originally located beyond reach of organized water and sewer facilities. The residents were forced to use available individual resources within boundaries of small lots or tracts of land.

40|$|Background Freshwater {{comprises}} about a mere 2. 5 % {{of total}} global water, of which approximately two-thirds is locked into glaciers at the polar ice caps and on mountains. In conjunction with this, {{in many instances}} irrigation with freshwater causes an increase in soil salinity due to overirrigation of agricultural land, inefficient water use and poor drainage of <b>unsuitable</b> <b>soils.</b> The problem of salinity was recognized {{a long time ago}} and, due to the importance of irrigated agriculture, numerous efforts have been devoted towards improving crop species for better utilization of saline soils and water. Irrigating plants with saline water is a challenge for practitioners and researchers throughout the world. †Scope Recruiting wild halophytes with economic potential was suggested several decades ago as a way to reduce the damage caused by salinization of soil and water. A range of cultivation systems for the utilization of halophytes have been developed, for the production of biofuel, purification of saline effluent in constructed wetlands, landscap-ing, cultivation of gourmet vegetables, and more. This review critically analyses past and present halophyte-based production systems in the context of genetics, physiology, agrotechnical issues and product value. There are still dif-ficulties that need to be overcome, such as direct germination in saline conditions or genotype selection. However, more and more research is being directed not only towards determining salt tolerance of halophytes, but also t...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAbstract: - The large {{construction}} projects cause inevitable {{negative impact on}} the natural landscape of the exposed areas. Among these is the creation of disturbed surfaces with <b>unsuitable</b> <b>soil</b> material and gradients that imply the destruction of existing vegetation. On these surfaces the revegetation becomes both necessary and difficult. In the Egnatia Motorway and its vertical axes case where the highway passes through rich areas of endemic flora and unique natural beauty, the restoration and aesthetic improvement of disturbed slopes is significant. It requires the use of native plant species of the local flora, which will be integrated into the natural landscape and adapted better with a minimum of maintenance requirements on local soil conditions and irrigation network for the optimal plant growth. The case of K 4 interchange in Thessaloniki is the practical application of measures that EGNATIA ODOS S. A. has designated for rehabilitation and aesthetic improvement of the urban landscape.

40|$|AbstractThe {{engineering}} structures are mostly constructed directly {{in contact with}} the ground and the response between the soil and the structure is termed as soil-engineering structure interaction. Peat is considered as <b>unsuitable</b> <b>soil</b> for supporting foundations in its natural state due to the high moisture content (> 100 %), high compressibility (0. 9 - 1. 5) and low shear strength (5 - 20 kPa) values. Peat also contains high organic matter (> 75 %), large deformation, high compressibility and high magnitude and rates of creep. Settlement is a common phenomenon in peat soil. The objectives of this study are to investigate and to analyse the deformation behaviour of the peat soil based on physical modelling and to critically compare it with sand. A model size of 200 cm x 50 cm x 90 cm was used with instrumentation (Displacement Transducers) to investigate and observed the deformation. The two different materials that were used are peat (remoulded hemic) and sand. Based on the results, deformation in sand corresponds to general bearing capacity failure and deformation in peat shows punching shear failure...|$|E

An experimental study is carried out to obtain the load-settlement response of a model circular footing resting on (a) unreinforced aggregate layer overlying a sandy soil layer, and (b) geogrid-reinforced aggregate layer overlying a sandy soil layer. A large-scale test chamber of size equal to 1 m x 1 m x 1 m is used to perform the experiments. Actuator of 10 T capacity is used to apply the loads in a displacement-rate controlled mode. A plate vibrator is used to prepare uniform sand and aggregate layers inside the test chamber. Relative density equal to 70 % is maintained for both the layers during the entire test program.
