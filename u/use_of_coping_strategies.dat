40|$|Background: Functional {{constipation}} {{has important}} psychological elements. Aim: To investigate {{the prevalence of}} functional constipation in an Asian population, and the interplay among functional constipation, anxiety/depression, perception and coping strategies. Methods: An interview of 3282 patients was made by telephone survey. Constipation was diagnosed by Rome II criteria. Coping ability and anxiety/depression were assessed by validated questionnaires. Results: Fourteen percent of the interviewees had constipation. Anxiety and depression scores were higher in constipated than in healthy subjects (P < 0. 0001 and < 0. 0001), and in female than male patients (P = 0. 02 and < 0. 0001). Patients who were aware of their symptoms perceived greater impact on their lives (P < 0. 001). Frequent <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> <b>strategies</b> associated with lower anxiety scores (P < 0. 0001). Female were more frequently aware of the symptoms (P = 0. 004), less frequently used coping strategies (P = 0. 008). Regression analysis showed that female and high anxiety level were the independent factors for predicting the perception of constipation, whereas anxiety was the only independent factor for predicting the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> <b>strategies.</b> Conclusion: Constipation associated with anxiety and depression is prevalent in the general Asian population. Female sex and anxiety are important aetiological factors in constipation, affecting perception and the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> <b>strategies.</b> link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

These interviews were analysed using Directed Content Analysis and results showed that children most often reported using active and adaptive coping strategies, followed by avoidant strategies.

Methods: A matched case-control design was adopted to compare differences among a target group of 30 patients with FD, a pain control group of 30 patients with rheumatism, and a control group of 30 healthy persons. A new interview questionnaire, the Coping Flexibility Interview Schedule, {{was used to assess}} subjects â experience of stressful life events, <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> <b>strategies,</b> and perceived severity of major FD symptoms. Results: Subjects with FD perceived their experienced stressors as more uncontrollable and as having a greater impact (p,. 05). They also used more direct-action strategies but fewer divert attention, acceptance, social support, and relaxation strategies when handling stressful life events (p,. 05). A significant group-by-controllability interaction effect was found (p,. 001), indicating that FD subjects tended to use coping strategies nondiscriminatively, whereas both rheumatic and healthy subjects tended to use coping strategies more discriminatively across stressful life events of different extents of controllability.
