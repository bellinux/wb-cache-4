5|$|Lords of Shadow is a third-person action-adventure game {{in which}} the player {{controls}} the main character, Gabriel Belmont. The combat involves a retractable chain whip called the Combat Cross. The player can perform up to forty unlockable combos with it. The commands consist of direct attacks for dealing damage to single enemies, and weak area attacks when surrounded by them. It is also capable of interactions with secondary weapons, such as knives, holy water and other items which can be upgraded. In addition, the Combat Cross's melee skills can be combined with the Light and Shadow magic system, which are spells aimed at defense and aggression, respectively. The whip is <b>upgradeable</b> and {{can also be used}} to guard against an opponent's attack.|$|E

25|$|Unlike the Mac Mini G4, the Intel-based Mac Mini uses a dual-channel {{architecture}} for memory. The original Intel-based Mac Mini uses 667MHz DDR2 SDRAM, while models {{starting with}} the early 2009 revision use 1066MHz DDR3 SDRAM. From the 2011 revision onwards, the Mac Mini supports up to 16GB of memory. While all versions of the Mac Mini {{up to and including}} the 2012 revision supports user <b>upgradeable</b> memory after purchase, the current model does not, because the memory is soldered to the logic board. Since the integrated graphics processor does not have its own dedicated memory, the system shares some of the main system memory with it.|$|E
25|$|The nuclear {{research}} reactor center will include radioisotope production and training facilities, future {{expansion of the}} center will include a fuel fabrication plant, as well as radioactive waste and cold neutron facilities. The reactor, which will be <b>upgradeable</b> to 10MW, will facilitate the training of nuclear operators and technicians as well as advanced {{nuclear research}} in neutron sciences and the commercial production of radioisotopes, it will also allow for practical experience for Jordanians in nuclear energy, reactor physics, radiochemistry and radiation protection. The research reactor is considered by Jordan Atomic Energy Commission (JAEC) officials {{to be an important}} precursor to Jordan's first nuclear power plant, a 750-1,000MW Generation III reactor to be built in an area in Mafraq 40 kilometers northeast of Amman and 15 kilometers away from the Hashemite University.|$|E
25|$|Many 2010-era digital delays {{present an}} {{extensive}} array of options, including a {{control over the}} time before playback of the delayed signal. Most also allow the user to select the overall level of the processed signal {{in relation to the}} unmodified one, or the level at which the delayed signal is fed back into the buffer, to be repeated again. Some systems in the 2010s allow more exotic controls, such as the ability to add an audio filter, or to play back the buffer's contents in reverse. As digital memory became cheaper in the 1980s, units like Lexicon PCM42, Roland SDE-3000, TC Electronic 2290 offered above 3 seconds delay time, enough to create background loops, rhythms and phrases. The 2290 was <b>upgradeable</b> to 32 seconds and Electro-Harmonix offered a 16-second delay and looping machine.|$|E
500|$|Like the Wii, the DSi has <b>upgradeable</b> firmware, and {{features}} a menu interface that displays applications as selectable icons. The seven primary icons represent [...] "Card Software", [...] "Nintendo DSi Camera", [...] "Nintendo DSi Sound", [...] "Nintendo DSi Shop", [...] "DS Download Play", [...] "PictoChat", and [...] "system settings"; additional applications may be downloaded from the DSi Shop. Icons {{are set in}} a grid navigable with the stylus or D-pad, and may be re-arranged via drag-and-drop. The power button can either soft reset the console, returning it to the main menu, or shut it down. Game cards may be hot swapped when the console is set to the main menu, allowing players to switch game cards without shutting down.|$|E
500|$|Other updates to the MacBook Pro include dual and quad-core Intel [...] "Skylake" [...] Core i5 and i7 processors, {{improved}} graphics, {{and displays}} {{that offer a}} 25% wider color gamut, 67% more brightness, and 67% more contrast. All versions are able to output to a 5K display, with the 15-inch models capable of two. The 15-inch models include a discrete Radeon Pro 450, 455 or 460 graphics card {{in addition to the}} integrated Intel graphics. Additionally, Apple introduced a cheaper lower-end 13-inch model which lacks the Touch Bar in favor of function keys, and has only two USB-C ports. The flash storage in the Touch Bar models is soldered to the logic board and is not <b>upgradeable,</b> while in the 13-inch model without Touch Bar, it is removable.|$|E
500|$|On April 13, 2010, Intel Core i5 and Core i7 CPUs were {{introduced}} in the 15- and 17-inch models, while the 13-inch retained the Core 2 Duo with a speed increase. The power brick was redesigned and a high-resolution display (of 1,680×1,050) was announced as an option for the 15-inch models. The 13-inch gained an integrated Nvidia GeForce 320M graphics processing unit (GPU) with 256MB of shared memory, while the 15- and 17-inch models were upgraded to the GeForce GT 330M, with either 256 or 512MB of dedicated memory. The 15- and 17-inch models also have an integrated Intel GPU that {{is built into the}} Core i5 and i7 processors. The 15-inch model also gained [...] Save for a third USB 2.0 slot, all the ports on the 17-inch MacBook Pro are the same in type and number as on the 15-inch version. All models come with 4GB of system memory that is <b>upgradeable</b> to 8GB. Battery life was also extended further in this update, to an estimated ten hours for the 13-inch and 8–9 hours on the 15- and 17-inch MacBook Pros. This was achieved through both greater power efficiency and adding more battery capacity. One reviewer reported about six hours of battery life through a continuous video battery stress test in the 15-inch and another, who called the battery life [...] "unbeatable", reported nearer to eight in the 13-inch through their [...] "highly demanding battery drain test".|$|E
2500|$|The first ZEN with Android 2.1 on board. (<b>Upgradeable</b> [...] to 2.2) [...] Has a microSD card slot, Bluetooth, wifi, and is {{available}} in 8GB with GPS, or 8GB or 16GB without GPS. The player comes bundled with the popular EP-630 in-ear earphones from Creative. A GPS version is also available in the 8GB capacity.|$|E
2500|$|Combat is {{undertaken}} from a first-person perspective; the player is {{armed with a}} variety of <b>upgradeable</b> firearms, as well as a crossbow, and boomerang-like weapons called [...] "wingsticks" [...] which can be used for stealthy attacks. There are several types of ammunition available for each weapon, to allow the player to further customize their play style. As an example, the crossbow's primary ammunition is metal bolts, but it also can shoot electrified bolts, explosive bolts, and more. There are two standard varieties of enemies: enemies with firearms which will take cover and exchange fire with the player, and melee enemies that will charge the player and attack with melee weapons.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2005, Google {{acquired}} Android Inc. for {{at least}} $50 million. Its key employees, including Rubin, Miner and White, joined Google {{as part of the}} acquisition. Not much was known about the secretive Android at the time, with the company having provided few details other than that it was making software for mobile phones. At Google, the team led by Rubin developed a mobile device platform powered by the Linux kernel. Google marketed the platform to handset makers and carriers on the promise of providing a flexible, <b>upgradeable</b> system. Google had [...] "lined up a series of hardware components and software partners and signaled to carriers that it was open to various degrees of cooperation".|$|E
2500|$|The Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland, was {{designed}} specifically {{to be able to}} either confirm or exclude the existence of the Higgs boson. Built in a 27km tunnel under the ground near Geneva originally inhabited by LEP, it {{was designed}} to collide two beams of protons, initially at energies of [...] per beam (7TeV total), or almost 3.6 times that of the Tevatron, and <b>upgradeable</b> to [...] (14TeV total) in future. Theory suggested if the Higgs boson existed, collisions at these energy levels should be able to reveal it. As one of the most complicated scientific instruments ever built, its operational readiness was delayed for 14 months by a magnet quench event nine days after its inaugural tests, caused by a faulty electrical connection that damaged over 50 superconducting magnets and contaminated the vacuum system.|$|E
2500|$|On June 10, 2013, Apple {{released}} another update in {{the same}} form factor as the 2012 model during the company's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC). The 11" [...] and 13" [...] models have a minimum standard 4 GB RAM, with a maximum configuration of 8 GB. Both models are powered by the Haswell ULT 1.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processors, with Turbo Boost up to 2.6GHz, while a 1.7GHz Dual-Core i7, with Turbo Boost up to 3.3GHz, option is also available. Each model's storage standard is 128 GB SSD, <b>upgradeable</b> to 256 GB and 512 GB SSD. Due to Haswell CPUs, battery life has considerably improved from the previous generation, and the mid-2013 models are capable of 9 hours on the 11" [...] model and 12 hours on the 13" [...] model; a team of reviewers exceeded expected battery life ratings during their test.|$|E
2500|$|A new aspect in {{the game}} is the Jackdaw, the ship that the player captains. The Jackdaw is <b>upgradeable</b> {{throughout}} the game, and is easily accessible to the player when needed. In addition, a new underwater component has been added. The player has access to a spyglass, allowing the examination of distant ships, along with their cargo and strength. It can also help determine if an island still has animals to hunt, treasures to find, high points to reach for synchronization or additional side-quests to complete, such as assassinations and naval contracts. An updated form of the recruit system introduced in [...] has returned, allowing Edward to recruit crew members. While Kenway's crew will remain loyal to him, they can be promoted to captain acquired ships, and are needed to assist in boarding enemy vessels, they cannot assist in combat or perform long-range assassinations, as in previous games. Ubisoft removed {{this aspect of the}} brotherhood system, believing it allowed players to bypass tense and challenging scenarios too easily.|$|E
2500|$|Reviewers {{had mixed}} views on Unbound Sagas gameplay. [...] The {{reviewer}} from Spazio Games, an Italian gaming site, compared {{the game to}} Double Dragon and Final Fight. [...] The reviewer felt that the game felt rushed, and this affected gameplay. [...] Carolyn Petit of GameSpot was more critical of the game, calling it [...] "dull" [...] and [...] "mindless. [...] IGN's Greg Miller noted the inclusion of combos and <b>upgradeable</b> character statistics, but felt that they [...] "never really amplify the fun in alternating between punch and kick." [...] Destructoid's Jim Sterling noted [...] "While there are more complex combos to unlock {{during the course of}} the game, the meat and potatoes of Unbound Saga is the endless hammering buttons to punch, kick and throw enemies around each level." [...] Co-reviewer Nick Chester called it [...] "classic beat-’em-up game". [...] Although giving the simple gameplay high marks, Chester felt that the PSP version of the game should have received cooperative play. Mike Jackson of GamesRadar appreciated the addition of cooperative gameplay on the Xbox 360 version, but wished players could join or leave on the fly.|$|E
2500|$|Toyota Australia {{released}} {{the second generation}} Camry in April 1987. Local manufacture of the V20 had begun earlier in February at its recently acquired Australian Motor Industries facility at Port Melbourne, Victoria {{as a replacement for}} the Corona T140 and the Camry before it. Four-cylinder engine production and panel-stamping was undertaken at Toyota's Altona, Victoria plant, all part of a model localization and factory upgrades investment totalling [...] In fact, it was the first Camry made outside Japan, and is notable for being the most localized Toyota Australia product thus far with a lead time of less than six months, the shortest yet between start of Japanese and Australian manufacture. Higher levels of specification were fitted with the locally built 2.0-liter 3S-FE motor, but the imported 1.8-liter 1S-i unit distinguished base SE and CS cars. Both sedans and wagons were offered and either engine offered standard five-speed manual transmission, <b>upgradeable</b> to the four-speed automatic. Features standard at the base level SE comprised: AM/FM radio, centre console storage compartment, remote fuel filler release, intermittent windscreen wipers, digital clock. CS cars added a tilt steering column to which the CS-X adds a key lock warning system. The CS driver's seat has front height adjustment; the CS-X's front and rear height adjustment. The CS gets a two speaker AM/FM radio cassette player; the CS-X a four-speaker system and automatic electric antenna, plus central locking, variable intermittent wipers and center rear arm rest. The sedan-only Ultima grade gains power windows, cruise control, automatic transmission as standard, velour trim, and a nine-stage graphic equalizer for the audio system. A fleet-focused Executive pack based on the SE arrived in May 1988, adding automatic transmission, power steering, and air conditioning. In June 1988, the 2.5-liter V6 was introduced, being an imported fully optioned model from Japan sold in limited numbers and distinguished from local four-cylinder cars by its unique bumpers and trim. Coinciding with the August 1989 facelift, the 2.0-liter 3S-FC engine with carburetor superseded the imported 1.8. The updates brought minor adjustments inside and out, including improved suspension, steering, and headlights. In May 1991, Toyota made the fuel-injected 3S-FE version standard upon the carburetored engine's deletion, and the CS trim level became CSi. Coinciding with this change, power steering became standard fitment and Toyota Australia refreshed badging, including the attachment of the new corporate logo consisting of three overlapping ellipses to form the letter [...] "T". With the May 1991 update, the Ultima models gained a CD player, the first Australian-built car to offer this. Towards the end of the series, special editions were released, starting with the Spirit of February 1991. Then in September 1992, value-added CSi Limited and Olympic Spirit cars came onto the scene. Australian production ended in late November 1992, in time for production of the XV10 to commence on 2 December. The Used Car Safety Ratings, published in 2008 by the Monash University Accident Research Centre, found that V20 Camry models provide an [...] "average" [...] (3/5 stars) level of occupant safety protection {{in the event of an}} accident.|$|E
