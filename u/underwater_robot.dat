25|$|In summer 1985, Ballard was {{aboard the}} French {{research}} ship Le Suroît, which {{was using the}} side scan sonar SAR {{to search for the}} Titanics wreck. When the French ship was recalled, he transferred onto a ship from Woods Hole, the R/V Knorr. Unbeknownst to some, this trip was financed by the U.S. Navy for secret reconnaissance of the wreckage of two Navy nuclear powered attack submarines, the USS Scorpion and the USS Thresher, which sank in the 1960s, and not for the Titanic. Back in 1982, he approached the Navy about his new deep sea <b>underwater</b> <b>robot</b> craft, the Argo, and his search for the Titanic. The Navy was not interested in financing it. However, they were interested in finding out what happened to their missing submarines and ultimately concluded that Argo was their best chance to do so. The Navy agreed it would finance his Titanic search only if he first searched for and investigated the two sunken submarines, and found out the state of their nuclear reactors after being submerged for such a long time, and whether their radioactivity was impacting the environment. He was placed on temporary active duty in the Navy, in charge of finding and investigating the wrecks. After the two missions were completed, time and funding permitting, he was free to use resources to hunt for the Titanic.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, small {{autonomous}} <b>underwater</b> <b>robots</b> {{are strongly}} preferred for remote exploration of unknown and unstructured environments.

40|$|Increasing {{efficiency}} {{by improving}} locomotion methods {{is a key}} issue for <b>underwater</b> <b>robots.</b> In this paper, we investigate the power consumption of different underwater robotic systems and compare the energy efficiency of the different robots depending on the desired motion. In particular, we compare the energy efficiency of <b>underwater</b> snake <b>robots,</b> which can provide both inspection and intervention capabilities and thus are interesting candidates {{for the next generation}} inspection and intervention AUVs, with those of the widely used robots for subsea operations which are the remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). In order to compare the energy efficiency of <b>underwater</b> snake <b>robots</b> with the energy efficiency of the ROVs, a simulation study is performed comparing the total energy consumption and the cost of transportation of <b>underwater</b> snake <b>robots</b> and ROVs. The simulation results show that with respect to the cost of transportation metric and the total energy consumption the <b>underwater</b> snake <b>robots</b> are more energy efficient for all the compared motion modes compared to the ROVs.

40|$|Abstract:- Fuzzy {{decision}} making on trajectory direction changes of pollution monitoring robots is {{addressed in this}} paper. Measured pollution densities and the possible existence of obstacles are used as the two fundamental data. While pursuing water pollution monitoring tasks, <b>underwater</b> <b>robots</b> may experience serious difficulties due to various kinds of obstacles in the water. Therefore, {{one of the major}} concerns for <b>underwater</b> <b>robots</b> is to detect and recognize obstacles in advance for natural and smooth movements without collision. Trajectory direction changes of a robot should be made so that the robot can move in the direction that the measured pollution data is increased most, especially when there are no obstacles. When there are obstacles along the robot’s path in the polluted area, proper trade-off should be made between the steepest ascending direction of pollutant densities and the possibilities of collision with obstacles or traps in them. Our experimental results show that <b>underwater</b> <b>robots,</b> which change the direction following the proposed fuzzy decision results, make their movement to the area of higher pollution density without collision...|$|R

In {{order to}} better control the motion state, a simulation model of <b>underwater</b> snake-like <b>robot</b> is established to investigate {{the relationship between the}} motion performance and the mechanical structure characteristics together with serpentine gait parameters. Based on the density ratio defined as the ratio of snake-like robot density to water density, the locomotion speed, output power and energy consumption of <b>underwater</b> snake-like <b>robot</b> is discussed. Further, with the optimum density ratio, the influence of serpentine gait parameters on the locomotion speed is analyzed.
