Patients who do not have a uterus or have a dysfunctional uterus now have the chance of dreaming with pregnancy and motherhood. Combining principles of solid organ transplantation and techniques of human reproduction, uterus transplantation is the first ephemeral transplant performed in order to promote reproductive potential of women and may be removed after successful pregnancy.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the effects of the combination of letrozole and melatonin on surgically induced endometriosis. Material and Methods: This prospective, randomized, controlled, experimental study was carried out at Yeditepe University Experimental Research Center (YUDETAM). Female non-pregnant, 17 nulligravid Wistar - Hannover albino rats with surgically induced endometriosis were used in this study. Endometriosis was induced by using homologous <b>uterine</b> horn <b>transplantation</b> in the rats. Four operations were performed on each rat. The induction of endometriosis was performed in the first operation. After two weeks of estradiol treatment the second operation was performed and endometriotic lesions were evaluated. Estrogen was then discontinued and in the study groups medications were started. During two weeks the rats were given medications and the third operation was performed for the assessment {{of the effects of the}} medications on the endometriotic foci. Then all the medications were stopped and estrogen was started again. Two weeks later all the rats were euthanized and recurrence of endometriosis was evaluated. Results: The sum of the lesion volumes in the control group was 93. 6 ± 31. 7 mm 3 at the end of the second week. After the cessation of estradiol it decreased to 85. 0 ± 23. 8 mm 3 (P= 0. 31) and increased to 119. 7 ± 29. 4 mm 3 at the sixth week (P= 0. 02). A significant reduction in histopathologic scores were seen after cessation of the estradiol (p= 0. 04). At the end of the sixth week, histopathological scores reached the pretreatment values. In the letrozole and melatonin group the sum of the lesion volumes decreased significantly after the treatment (82. 8 ± 21. 0 mm 3 and 15. 7 ± 8. 0 mm 3 respectively). At the end of the sixth week, the mean volume was calculated as 43. 9 ± 31. 8 mm 3 (p= 0. 002). Histopathologic scores were 2. 3 ± 0. 1, 2. 0 ± 0. 2 and 2. 2 ± 0. 3 at the end of the second, fourth and sixth weeks, respectively, in the letrozole and melatonin group.

Here a murine model of Asherman’s syndrome was created by traumatizing the uterus. We evaluate stem cell recruitment and pregnancy after BMDSCs transplantation in a model of Asherman’s syndrome. In the Asheman’s syndrome model, after BMDSC transplant, the Y chromosome bearing CD 45 -cells represented less than 0. 1 % of total endometrial cells. Twice the number of Y+CD 45 - cells was identified in the damaged uterus compared to the uninjured controls.

Transgenic female mice expressing the Fat- 1 gene under {{transcriptional}} control of the goat β-casein promoter produce milk phospholipids having elevated levels of n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). However, females from this line were also observed to have impaired reproductive performance characterized by a smaller litter size (2. 7  ±  0. 6 vs. 7. 2  ±  0. 7; P <  0. 05) than wildtype controls. While there is a close association between PUFA metabolism, prostaglandin biosynthesis, and fertility; reproductive problems in these mice were unanticipated given that the Fat- 1 transgene is primarily expressed in the lactating mammary gland. Using multiple approaches it was found that Fat- 1 mice have normal ovulation and fertilization rates; however fewer embryos were present in the uterus prior to implantation. Small litter size was also found to be partly attributable to a high incidence of post-implantation fetal resorptions. Embryo transfer experiments revealed that embryos developing from oocytes derived from transgenic ovaries had an increased rate of post-implantation resorption, regardless of the <b>uterine</b> genotype. Ovary <b>transplantation</b> between Fat- 1 and C 57 BL/ 6 wildtype females revealed that non-ovarian factors also contributed to the smaller litter size phenotype. Finally, surgical removal of the mammary glands from juvenile Fat- 1 mice increased the subsequent number of implantation sites per female, but did not lessen the high rate of post-implantation resorptions.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: The {{aim of this}} {{systematic}} review was to evaluate and compare {{the pros and cons}} of using living donors or brain-dead donors in uterus transplantation programs, 2 years after the first worldwide live birth after uterus transplantation. METHODS: The Medline database and the Central Cochrane Library were used to locate <b>uterine</b> <b>transplantation</b> studies carried out in human or nonhuman primates. All types of articles (case reports, original studies, meta-analyses, reviews) in English or French were considered for inclusion. RESULTS: Overall, 92 articles were screened and 44 were retained for review. Proof of concept for human <b>uterine</b> <b>transplantation</b> was demonstrated in 2014 with a living donor. Compared with a brain-dead donor strategy, a living donor strategy offers greater possibilities for planning surgery and also decreases cold ischemia time, potentially translating into a higher success rate. However, this approach poses ethical problems, given that the donor is exposed to surgery risks but does not derive any direct benefit. A brain-dead donor strategy is more acceptable from an ethical viewpoint, but its feasibility is currently unproven, potentially owing to a lack of compatible donors, and is associated with a longer cold ischemia time and a potentially higher rejection rate. CONCLUSIONS: The {{systematic review}} demonstrates that <b>uterine</b> <b>transplantation</b> is a major surgical innovation for the treatment of absolute uterine factor infertility.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{develop an}} orthotopic, allogeneic, <b>uterine</b> <b>transplantation</b> {{technique}} and an effective immunosuppressive protocol in the sheep model. METHODS: In this pilot study, 10 sexually mature ewes {{were subjected to}} laparotomy and total abdominal hysterectomy with oophorectomy to procure uterus allografts. The cold ischemic time was 60 min. End-to-end vascular anastomosis was performed using continuous, non-interlocking sutures. Complete tissue reperfusion was achieved in all animals within 30 s after the vascular re-anastomosis, without any evidence of arterial or venous thrombosis. The immunosuppressive protocol consisted of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and methylprednisolone tablets. Graft viability was assessed by transrectal ultrasonography and second-look laparotomy at 2 and 4 weeks, respectively. RESULTS: Viable uterine tissue and vascular patency were observed on transrectal ultrasonography and second-look laparotomy. Histological analysis of the graft tissue (performed in one ewe) revealed normal tissue architecture with a very subtle inflammatory reaction but no edema or stasis. CONCLUSION: We have developed a modified procedure that allowed us to successfully perform orthotopic, allogeneic, <b>uterine</b> <b>transplantation</b> in sheep, whose uterine and vascular anatomy (apart from the bicornuate uterus) {{is similar to the}} human anatomy, making the ovine model excellent for human uterine transplant research...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{transplantation}} {{to enhance}} {{quality of life}} is a growing clinical field that also includes transplantation of reproductive organs. Transplantation of the uterus has been suggested as future method to treat uterus factor infertility. To investigate the feasibility of <b>uterine</b> <b>transplantation</b> and to develop safe methods, research must be performed in appropriate animal and in vitro models. This thesis investigates the effects of ischemia and reperfusion on functional, morphological and biochemical parameters in the uterus in several experimental models and also describes these models. The tolerance of the uterus to cold ischemia was evaluated in a previously developed mouse model for uterus transplantation. Cold ischemia for 24 h did not impair the ability of the mouse uterus to implant embryos and produce normal offspring if University of Wisconsin preservation buffer (UW) was used during ischemia. Also, in vitro studies on human myometrium showed that myometrial contractions, protein synthesis and energy production were well preserved after cold ischemia in UW or the preservation solution Perfadex for 6 h. A pig model for auto-transplantation of the uterus was developed and found to be of less value since the number of successful transplantations was low (21 %) due to surgical difficulties related to the anatomy of the pig. In the development of a sheep model other surgical strategies could be used and the success rate was considerably higher (71 %). Evaluation of biochemical and morphological parameters during reperfusion after of short time cold ischemia showed recovered metabolism and only a slight inflammatory response that was further reduced by the use of the preservation solution Perfadex during cold ischemia. A rat model was also developed to complement to the mouse as a small animal model for <b>uterine</b> <b>transplantation</b> research. Morphological signs of post-ischemic inflammation in rat uteri transplanted after 24 h of cold ischemia were reduced by pre-treatment of the donor and the recipient with progesterone or prednisolone. In summary, {{it was found that the}} mouse, the rat and the sheep can serve as appropriate model animals for studies of various aspects of uterus transplantation. It was also found that in these non-rejecting models the uterus is fairly resistant to injuries induced by surgery and cold ischemia and can tolerate cold ischemic storage for at least 24. However, in a possible future human application, organ injuries induced by ischemia should be reduced. Potential strategies to achieve this could include the use of short ischemic times, appropriate preservation solutions and anti-inflammatory pre-treatment of donor and recipient. These studies have moved the research front in <b>uterine</b> <b>transplantation</b> forward and it is predicted that <b>uterine</b> <b>transplantation</b> can reach the clinical setting within 5 years...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Uterine</b> <b>transplantation</b> {{could serve}} as a tool in studies of the {{physiology}} of implantation/ pregnancy, and is also a possible future treatment for patients with absolute uterine infertility. Here, the ®rst live-born offspring in any <b>uterine</b> <b>transplantation</b> model is reported. METHODS: A syngeneic mouse model with a uterus transplanted, by end-to-side aorta/vena cava vascular anastomoses, alongside the native uterus was used. The cervix was attached to a cutaneous stoma. Pregnancy rate and offspring (birth weight, growth and fertility) was evaluated after blastocyst transfer to the native and the grafted uterus of transplanted mice and to controls. RESULTS: Pregnancy rates were comparable in the grafted uterus (8 / 12 animals became pregnant) and the native uterus (9 / 12 pregnant) of transplanted animals and controls (8 / 13 pregnant). In a separate set of animals, the native uterus was removed at transplantation to exclude in¯uences from the native uterus on the pregnancy potential of the graft; two of four animals became pregnant after blastocyst transfer. The weights/lengths of fetuses (gestational day 18) and gestational lengths were similar in all groups. Offspring were delivered and the growth trajectories (up to 8 weeks) of offspring delivered from grafted or native uteri of transplanted mice were similar as compared with controls, and all were fertile. The second-generation offspring from transplanted animals were all fertile with normal birth weights. CONCLUSIONS: These observations document the capacity of a transplanted uterus to harbour pregnancies to term, and reveal that offspring from a transplanted uterus develop to normal fertile adults.

40|$|Uterus {{transplantation}} is {{a possible}} future treatment for uterine factor infertility, which can be either congenital (uterus agenesis/hypoplasia) or acquired (hysterectomy or intrauterine adhesions). The present study represents experiments where an animal model for <b>uterine</b> <b>transplantation</b> was developed and characterized. Initially, a method for heterotopic <b>uterine</b> <b>transplantation</b> in the mouse was developed. The experiments involved syngeneic transplantation of the uterine horn placed alongside the native uterus. Vascular connections were accomplished by end-to-side anastomoses of aorta/aorta and vena cava/vena cava. There was a typical learning curve of the procedure, with the success rate increasing with experience. Histological evaluation showed that the transplanted uterus was well preserved and the blood flow {{was similar to that}} of the native uterus. In one animal, embryos were transferred into the transplanted uterus and pregnancy occurred. This is the first time pregnancy has been shown in a transplanted mouse uterus. The model was modified to include a cervical cutaneous stoma of the transplanted uterus and the implantation rate was thereby increased. In a detailed study of pregnancy in the transplanted uteri it was shown that implantation and pregnancy rates were similar to the native uteri of the transplanted animals and to control animals. Furthermore, offspring from transplanted uteri developed normally and were fertile. This study shows that transplanted uteri can harbour pregnancies until term and that offspring develop fully normally in a syngeneic setting. A crucial aspect in organ transplantation is the preservation of the graft ex vivo. To test the tolerance of the uterus to cold ischemia, mouse uteri were removed and kept at 4 oC in preservation solution for 24 or 48 h. It was shown that the uterus was well preserved after 24 h and could be transplanted to a donor with preserved functionality, which was proven by the ability to implant embryos and to carry a normal pregnancy. The behaviour of the transplanted murine uterus in an allogeneic setting was tested. Uteri of BALB/c mice were transplanted into C 57 BL/ 6 recipients. It was shown that the blood flow in the grafted uteri was reduced already after 2 days with a continuous decrease after that. The transplanted uteri showed slight inflammatory changes at 2 days and after 5 days rejection was obvious. At 10 days severe rejection was seen and after 15 days the transplants were necrotic. The study shows that the time frame for the rejection and the mechanisms for rejection of the uterus are similar to that of other parenchymal organs. In summary, this study has shown that a mouse animal model can be used for experimental studies on <b>uterine</b> <b>transplantation.</b> It shows for the first time pregnancies and normal offspring in a uterus transplantation model. Moreover, the studies show that the uterus is a fairly tolerable organ, which can be preserved for at least 24 h under cold ischemic conditions, and that rejection is similar to that of other transplanted organs...|$|E

In the early phase, it is also recommendable that patients are referred worldwide to the Gothenburg team, which is at present the only team with the required background, wider experience and skills, as well as a comprehensive program.

METHODS: Uteri of BALB/c mice were transplanted to a heterotopic position in C 57 BL/ 6 recipients, whose native uteri were left in situ. The blood flow of the uteri, their gross appearance and general histology and the density of T-lymphocytes were examined on postoperative days 2 – 28. RESULTS: Macroscopic signs of rejection were apparent from day 5. At the light microscopy level, minimal inflammatory changes were seen from day 5 and massive inflammation was seen from day 10 to day 15. At day 28, necrosis and fibrosis were seen. The density of T-lymphocytes (CD 3 +) was increased in the grafted uterus from day 2 in the myometrium and from day 5 in the endometrium. Blood flow in the grafted uteri was reduced from day 15.

Other experiments have demonstrated that the prim-ary effect of theuterus on the ovary is local in nature since unilateral hysterectomy in ewes with cl in both ovaries results in the normal regression of the luteal tissue on the ovary next to the remaining uterine horn, while the cl on the ovary with no uterine connection are maintained for at least 35 days (Moor & Rowson, 1966; Caldwell, Rowson, Moor & Hay, 1969). Various ovarian and <b>uterine</b> <b>transplantation</b> experiments {{support the view that}} the uterus has a local 'luteolytic effect ' while providing evidence that a systemic pathway may also exist by which the uterus may control luteal regression. Autotransplants of endometrial tissue to the flank of fourteen hysterectomized ewes resulted in cycle lengths of about 40 days duration in seven of the ewes (Caldwell et al., 1969), and the vascular autotransplantation of the left ovary to a skin loop in the neck ofunilaterally ovariectomized sheep resulted in prolonged cycles due to the presence of persistent cl (Goding, McCracken & Baird, 1967; Goding...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{reports the}} first four cases of a uterine {{transplant}} procedure conducted in sheep in Latin America. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the success of <b>uterine</b> <b>transplantation</b> in sheep. METHOD: The study was conducted at Laboratory of Medical Investigation 37 (LIM 37) at the University of São Paulo School of Medicine. Four healthy mature ewes weighing 40 - 60 kg were used as both the donor and recipient for a transplant within the same animal (auto-transplant). Institutional guidelines for the care of experimental animals were followed. RESULTS: The first two cases of auto-transplant were performed to standardize the technique. After complete uterine mobilization and isolation of the blood supply, the unilateral vascular pedicle was sectioned and anastomosed on the external iliac vessels. After standardization, the protocol was implemented. Procurement surgery was performed without complications or bleeding. After isolation of uterine arteries and veins as well as full mobilization of the uterus, ligation of the distal portion of the internal iliac vessels was performed with subsequent division and end-to-side anastomosis of the external iliac vessels. After vaginal anastomosis, the final case presented with arterial thrombosis in the left uterine artery. The left uterine artery anastomosis was re-opened and flushed with saline solution to remove the clot from the artery lumen. Anastomosis was repeated with restoration of blood flow for a few minutes before another uterine artery thrombosis appeared on the same side. All four animals were alive after the surgical procedure and were euthanized after the experimental period. CONCLUSION: We describe the success of four uterine auto-transplants in sheep models...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Uterine {{blood flow}} is an {{important}} factor in uterine viability, but the number of blood vessels required to maintain viability is uncertain. In this study, indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging was used to examine uterine hemodynamics and vessels associated with uterine blood flow in cynomolgus macaque. METHODS: The uterus of a female cynomolgus macaque was cut from the vaginal canal to mimic a situation during trachelectomy or <b>uterine</b> <b>transplantation</b> surgery in which uterine perfusion is maintained only with uterine and ovarian vessels. Intraoperative uterine hemodynamics was observed using ICG fluorescence imaging under conditions in which various nutrient vessels were selected by clamping of blood vessels. A time-intensity curve was plotted using imaging analysis software to measure the T(max) of uterine perfusion for selected blood vessel patterns. Open surgery was performed with the uterus receiving nutritional support only from uterine vessels on one side. The size of the uterus after surgery was monitored using transabdominal ultrasonography. RESULTS: The resulting time-intensity curves displayed the average intensity in the regions of the uterine corpus and uterine cervix, and in the entire uterus. Analyses of the uterine hemodynamics in the cynomolgus macaque showed that uterine vessels were significantly related to uterine perfusion (P= 0. 008), whereas ovarian vessels did not have a significant relationship (P= 0. 588). When uterine vessels were clamped, ovarian vessels prolonged the time needed to reach perfusion maximum. Postoperative transabdominal ultrasonography showed that the size of the uterus was not changed 2 months after surgery, with recovery of periodic menstruation. The cynomolgus macaque has got pregnant with favorable fetus well-being. CONCLUSION: Uterine vessels may be responsible for uterine blood flow, and even one uterine vessel may be sufficient to maintain uterine viability in cynomolgus macaque. Our results show that ICG fluorescence imaging is useful for evaluation of uterine blood flow since this method allows real-time observation of uterine hemodynamics...|$|E
40|$|Since 2000, eleven human <b>uterine</b> <b>transplantation</b> {{procedures}} (UTx) {{have been}} performed across Europe and Asia. Five of these have, to date, resulted in pregnancy and four live births have now been recorded. The most significant obstacles to the availability of UTx are presently scientific and technical, relating to the safety and efficacy of the procedure itself. However, if and when such obstacles are overcome, the most likely barriers to its availability will be social and financial in nature, relating in particular to the ability and willingness of patients, insurers, or the state to pay. Thus, publicly funded healthcare systems such as the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) will eventually {{have to decide whether}} UTx should be funded. With this in mind, we seek to provide an {{answer to the question of}} whether there exist any compelling reasons for the state not to fund UTx. The paper proceeds as follows. It assumes, at least for the sake of argument, that UTx will become sufficiently safe and cost-effective to be a candidate for funding and then asks, given that, what objections to funding there might be. Three main arguments are considered and ultimately rejected as providing insufficient reason to withhold funding for UTx. The first two are broad in their scope and offer an opportunity to reflect on wider issues about funding for infertility treatment in general. The third is narrower in scope and could, in certain forms, apply to UTx but not other assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs). The first argument suggests that UTx should not be publicly funded because doing so would be inconsistent with governments’ obligations to prevent climate change and environmental pollution. The second claims that UTx does not treat a disorder and is not medically necessary. Finally, the third asserts that funding for UTx should be denied because of the availability of alternatives such as adoption and surrogacy...|$|E
40|$|Women with {{absolute}} uterine factor infertility (AUFI) are considered as being ‘unconditionally infertile’. <b>Uterine</b> <b>transplantation</b> (UTx) {{may be a}} possible treatment option {{in the future for}} such women. This thesis describes a number of key areas of research that are important in order to move closer to a successful and crucially, safe transplant in the human setting. Nine allogeneic transplants were carried out in a rabbit model to investigate anatomical and surgical aspects necessary for a successful UTx. An attempt to characterise and quantify the immunological mechanisms involved in allogeneic UTx (rejection patterns) was made. Out of the nine recipients, one was a long-term survivor. Embryo transfer was performed in this one doe with the aim of establishing pregnancy. Performing UTx in a large-animal model is necessary as the pelvis resembles a woman’s reproductive system more closely. In addition, the anastomotic technique is similar. Five sheep autotransplants were performed to further define surgical techniques. The anastomotic model was internal to external iliac vessel. Out of the five transplants, three sheep demonstrated adequate perfusion in the immediate post-operative period. Furthermore, the suitability of two different imaging modalities, pulse oximetry and multispectral imaging, for assessing uterine perfusion and extent of ischaemia were been studied in both the rabbit and sheep models. Biophotonics was also applied in the form of Endoscopic Laser Speckle Contrast Analysis to characterize blood flow in the two models. Both Multispectral Imaging and Endoscopic Laser Speckle Contrast Analysis have never been assessed before in a gynecological context. In order to transfer the concept of UTx to the human, we carried out a retrospective study of abdominal radical trachelectomy (ART) as a potential replacement for radical hysterectomy in patients with early stage cervical cancer desiring a fertility-sparing procedure. ART forms the foundation of the original work into aspects of UTx. This original body of research revolved around the potential blood supply to a uterus. Furthermore, an attempt has been made to analyse the motivations, aims and feelings of patients diagnosed with AUFI towards UTx. Forty patients were interviewed. The final study involved the evaluation of the perceptions of health care professionals towards UTx, with 528 participants surveyed. Open Acces...|$|E
