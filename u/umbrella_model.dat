40|$|Supported {{vanadium}} oxide catalysts {{are widely used}} in industry. However, the molecular structure of the active species, responsible for the actual catalysis, is for a large part still unknown. This thesis describes four years study on the elucidation of this molecular structure. It mainly focuses on the <b>umbrella</b> <b>model</b> (Figure 8. 1). This model was introduced by Dr. Gijzeman {{as an alternative to}} models already present in the literature. In this model the vanadium atom is linked to the surface via only one Si-Os-V bond and further consists of a V=O and a perturbed O 2 molecule linked to the central vanadium atom. Spectroscopic characteristics (Raman, IR) for the <b>umbrella</b> <b>model</b> have been calculated for two types of support, alumina and silica, and compare very well with experimental data found in the literature. From this comparison it could be concluded that the <b>umbrella</b> <b>model</b> is able to assign vibrations to the observed peaks at 900, 980 and 1040 cm? 1 and can also explain the width of the peaks. A comparison between several model structures, the umbrella models and three alternative models from literature, has been made against experimental Raman and IR spectra. It could be concluded that the method of synthesis has an influence on the type of active species on the support. Regarding the conversion of methanol to formaldehyde, one of the processes for which this catalyst is used, a plausible reaction mechanism has been presented based on the <b>umbrella</b> <b>model.</b> Basically it involves three steps. In the first step a methanol molecule is converted into formaldehyde and water, with the removal of one oxygen atom from the -VO 3 species. In the second step this process is repeated, which leaves a -VO species that can readily reactivated by the attachment of a whole oxygen molecule. For this last step to be possible spin orbit coupling, a relativistic property, is needed. A first study into the relativistic properties of the vibrations of molecules has been done. keywords: supported {{vanadium oxide}} catalyst model, theoretical chemistry, Raman, I...|$|E

40|$|Cholesterol plays a {{vital role}} in {{determining}} the physiochemical properties of cell membranes. However, the detailed nature of cholesterol–lipid interactions is a subject of ongoing debate. Existing conceptual models, including the Condensed Complex Model, the Superlattice Model, and the <b>Umbrella</b> <b>Model,</b> identify different molecular mechanisms as the key to cholesterol–lipid interactions. In this work, the compositional dependence of the chemical potential of cholesterol in cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine mixtures was systematically measured at high resolution at 37 °C by using an improved cholesterol oxidase (COD) activity assay. The chemical potential of cholesterol was found to be much higher in di 18 : 1 -PC bilayers than in di 16 : 0 -PC bilayers, indicating a more favorable interaction between cholesterol and saturated chains. More significantly, in 16 : 0, 18 : 1 -PC and di 18 : 1 -PC bilayers, the COD initial-reaction rate displays a series of distinct jumps near the cholesterol mole fractions (χC) of 0. 15, 0. 25, 0. 40, 0. 50, and 0. 57 and a peak at the cholesterol maximum solubility limit of 0. 67. These jumps have been identified as the thermodynamic signatures of stable cholesterol regular distributions. In contrast, no such jumps were evident in di 16 : 0 -PC bilayers below χC of 0. 57. The observed chemical potential profile is in excellent agreement with previous Monte Carlo simulations based on the <b>Umbrella</b> <b>Model</b> but not with the predictions from the other models. The data further indicate that the cholesterol regular distribution domains (superlattices) are not the hypothesized condensed complexes.

40|$|Trade policy {{depends on}} the extent to which the {{government}} wants to redistribute income as well as on a country's overall factor endowments and their distribution. While the government's desire to redistribute income itself is dependent on asset distribution, it is to a large extent also driven by the partisan nature of the government, i. e., whether it is pro-labor or pro-capital. Using cross-country data on factor endowments, inequality and government orientation, we find that, conditional on inequality, left-wing (pro-labor) governments will adopt more protectionist trade policies in capital-rich countries, but adopt more pro-trade policies in labor-rich economies than right-wing (pro-capital) ones. Also higher inequality is associated with higher protection in capital-abundant countries while it is associated with lower protection in labor-abundant countries. These results are consistent with the simultaneous presence of both general- as well as special-interest politics as determinants of protection within a two-factor, two-sector Heckscher-Ohlin framework. Overall, various statistical tests support an <b>umbrella</b> <b>model</b> (that combines both the general-interest as well as special-interest models) over each of the individual models. ...|$|E

We investigated the formations of superlattices at cholesterol mole fraction of 0. 154, 0. 25, 0. 40, and 0. 5 using Monte Carlo simulation. We found that in general, conventional pairwise-additive interactions cannot produce superlattices. Instead, a multibody (nonpairwise) interaction is required.

The <b>Umbrella</b> and Penknife <b>models</b> predict that only α-helix 5 of domain I along with adjacent helices α- 4 or α- 6 insert into the brush border membranes because of their hydrophobic nature. By employing fluorescent-labeled cysteine mutations, we observe that all three domains of the toxin insert into the insect membrane. Using proteinase K protection assays, steady state fluorescence quenching measurements, and blue shift analysis of acrylodan-labeled cysteine mutants, we show that regions beyond those proposed by the two models insert into the membrane. Based on our studies, the only extended region that does not partition into the membrane is that of α-helix 1. Bioassays and voltage clamping studies show that all mutations examined, except certain domain II mutations in loop 2 (e. g. F 371 C and G 374 C), which disrupt membrane partitioning, retain their ability to form ion channels and toxicity in Manduca sexta larvae.
