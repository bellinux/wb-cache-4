"If the {{political}} history {{of these four}} years is ever truthfully written," [...] Mr. Foley continued, [...] "the world will be amazed at the calm indifference of the people threatened day by day with national disaster. We who have been behind the scenes have kept a stiff upper lip before the world, but I tell you frankly, Mr. Maraton, that no Cabinet who ever undertook the government of this country has gone through what we have gone through. Three times we {{have been on the}} brink of war--twice on our own account and once on account of those whom we are bound to consider our allies. The other national disaster we have had to face, you know of. Still, here we are safe up to to-night.

This branch has always had the honour of electing Thursdays for the Central European Council. We have elected many and splendid Thursdays. We all lament the sad decease of the heroic worker who {{occupied}} the post <b>until</b> <b>last</b> <b>week.</b> As you know, his services to the cause were considerable. He organised the great dynamite coup of Brighton which, under happier circumstances, ought to have killed everybody on the pier. As you also know, his death was as self-denying as his life, for he died through his faith in a hygienic mixture of chalk and water {{as a substitute for}} milk, which beverage he regarded as barbaric, and as involving cruelty to the cow. Cruelty, or anything approaching to cruelty, revolted him always. But it is not to acclaim his virtues that we are met, but for a harder task. It is difficult properly to praise his qualities, but it is more difficult to replace them. Upon you, comrades, it devolves this evening to choose out of the company present the man who shall be Thursday. If any comrade suggests a name I will put it to the vote. If no comrade suggests a name, I can only tell myself that that dear dynamiter, who is gone from us, has carried into the unknowable abysses the last secret of his virtue and his innocence." ...|$|E

5000|$|Bodacious, {{who earned}} a {{reputation}} as the world's most dangerous bull by giving cowboys a phenomenal qualified ride or hellacious wreck, is no more. He was 12 years old. And 12 years old in bull years is approximately the equivalent of 60 in human years. [...] "He was the baddest bull that I ever saw," [...] said four-time world champion Tuff Hedeman. Hedeman made the greatest and worst rides of his career on Bodacious. Bodacious had an volatile style of bucking which made him a rodeo celebrity. He could rear higher than most bulls. Bodacious tricked cowboys into leaning forward to stay in rhythm with his bucking. He did this so that he could throw his head back and strike the rider in his face with it. Bodacious repeated this move with many of the cowboys who tried to get a qualified ride on him. [...] "Athletically speaking, Bodacious was the 300-pound offensive lineman who could also star at cornerback," [...] Hedeman said. Since his retirement in 199, Bodacious sired hundreds of offspring. <b>Until</b> <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> he looked healthy. [...] "He looked good" [...] until the end, Carolyn Andrews said.
