40|$|Derived from semi-{{classical}} {{quantum field}} theory in curved spacetime, Unruh effect {{was known as a}} quantum effect. We find that there does exist a classical correspondence of this effect in electrodynamics. The thermal nature of the vacuum in correlation function for the <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerated</b> detector is coming from the non-linear relationship between the proper time and the propagating length of the electromagnetic wave. Both the Coulomb field of the detector itself and the radiation supporting the detector's <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerating</b> <b>motion</b> contribute to the non-vanishing vacuum energy. From this observation we conclude that Unruh temperature experienced by a <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerated</b> classical electron has no additional effects to Born's solution for laboratory observers far away from the classical electron.

40|$|This is a {{critical}} review of inert properties of classical relativistic point objects. The objects are classified as Galilean and non-Galilean. Three types of non-Galilean objects are considered: spinning, rigid, and dressed particles. In the absence of external forces, such particles are capable of executing not only uniform motions along straight lines but also Zitterbewegungs, self-accelerations, self-decelerations, and <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerated</b> <b>motions.</b> A free non-Galilean object possesses the four-velocity and the four-momentum which are in general not collinear, therefore, its inert properties are specified by two, rather than one, invariant quantities. It is shown that a spinning particle {{need not be a}} non-Galilean object. The necessity of a rigid mechanics {{for the construction of a}} consistent classical electrodynamics in spacetimes of dimension D + 1 is justified for D + 1 > 4. The problem of how much the form of fundamental laws of physics orders four dimensions of our world is revised together with its solution suggested by Ehrenfest.

40|$|The {{rotating}} reference system, two-point correlation functions, {{and energy}} density {{are used as}} the basis for investigating thermal effects observed by a detector rotating through random classical zero-point radiation. The RS consists of Frenet -Serret orthogonal tetrads where the rotating detector is at rest and has a constant acceleration vector. The CFs and the energy density at the rotating reference system should be periodic with rotation period because CF and energy density measurements is one of the tools the detector can use to justify the periodicity of its motion. The CFs have been calculated for both electromagnetic and massless scalar fields in two cases, with and without taking this periodicity into consideration. It turned out that only periodic CFs have some thermal features and particularly the Planck's factor with the temperature T= h w /k. Regarding to the energy density of both electromagnetic and massless scalar field it is shown that the detector rotating in the zero-point radiation observes not only this original zero-point radiation but, above that, also the radiation which would have been observed by an inertial detector in the thermal bath with the Plank's spectrum at the temperature T. This effect is masked by factor 2 / 3 (4 gamma^ 2 - 1) for the electromagnetic field and 2 / 9 (4 gamma ^ 2 - 1) for the massless scalar field, where the Lorentz factor gamma=(1 - v^ 2 / c^ 2) ^(1 / 2). Appearance of these masking factors is connected with the fact that rotation is defined by two parameters, angular velocity w and the radius of rotation, in contrast with a <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerated</b> linear <b>motion</b> which is defined by only one parameter, acceleration a. Our calculations involve classical point of view only and {{to the best of our}} knowledge these results have not been reported in quantum theory yet. Comment: MikTex, 23 page...|$|R

50|$|This {{raised the}} {{question}} of why the motive force of impetus does not therefore move the spheres with infinite speed. One impetus dynamics answer seemed to be that it was a secondary kind of motive force that produced uniform motion rather than infinite speed, rather than producing <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerated</b> <b>motion</b> like the primary force did by producing constantly increasing amounts of impetus. However, in his Treatise on the heavens and the world in which the heavens are moved by inanimate inherent mechanical forces, Buridan's pupil Oresme offered an alternative Thomist inertial response to this problem in that he did posit a resistance to motion inherent in the heavens (i.e. in the spheres), but which is only a resistance to acceleration beyond their natural speed, rather than to motion itself, and was thus a tendency to preserve their natural speed.|$|E

This is in contrast to Unruh and Wald’s result [7] that the absorption of a Rindler particle by a <b>uniformly</b> <b>accelerated</b> Unruh-DeWitt detector [8]-[9] corresponds to the emission of a Minkowski particle.
