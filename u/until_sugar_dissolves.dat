50|$|Stir {{together}} {{sugar and}} 3½ cups {{water in a}} large bowl or pot <b>until</b> <b>sugar</b> is <b>dissolved.</b> Add lemon juice, rum, cognac, and brandy and chill, covered, at least 3 hours. Put half-gallon ice block in a punch bowl and pour punch over it.|$|R
50|$|Asbach Uralt {{brandy and}} sugar cubes {{are added to}} a cup. In Rüdesheim, a cup that is {{specially}} designed for this beverage is used. The brandy is flambéed and stirred for a minute <b>until</b> the <b>sugar</b> <b>dissolves.</b> Strong coffee is added, followed by a topping of thickly whipped cream sweetened with vanilla sugar. Chocolate flakes are scattered onto the cream as a garnish.|$|R
50|$|Squeeze {{juice from}} lime wedges into the glass. Place {{one of the}} lime wedges into the glass and add sugars. Muddle sugar with the lime wedges. Be careful not to overdo the muddling of the lime rind as it may {{introduce}} {{too much of the}} essential oils from the lime and make the drink too bitter. Pour in vodka and stir well <b>until</b> the <b>sugar</b> is <b>dissolved.</b> Add crushed ice and stir to melt some of the ice. Garnish with lime slice or wedge and serve.|$|R
50|$|A basic sugar-and-water syrup used by bartenders as a {{sweetener}} to make cocktails. Simple syrup {{is made by}} stirring {{granulated sugar}} into hot water in a saucepan <b>until</b> the <b>sugar</b> is <b>dissolved</b> and then cooling the solution. Generally, the ratio of sugar to water can range anywhere from 1:1 to 2:1 by weight, and similarly by volume due to air in the granulated sugar. For pure sucrose the saturation limit is about 5:4 by volume. Syrup {{can be used as}} a sweetener. However, since the syrup jells readily when pectin is added, its primary culinary use is as a base for fruit sauces, toppings, and preserves.|$|R

50|$|Condensed {{milk can}} be made from {{evaporated}} milk by mixing one measure of evaporated milk with one and a quarter measures of sugar in a saucepan, then heating and stirring the mixture <b>until</b> the <b>sugar</b> is completely <b>dissolved,</b> then cooling. It can also be made by simmering regular milk and <b>sugar,</b> <b>until</b> it is reduced by 60%.|$|R
5|$|Liquid sugars {{are strong}} syrups {{consisting}} of 67% granulated <b>sugar</b> <b>dissolved</b> in water. They {{are used in}} the food processing {{of a wide range of}} products including beverages, hard candy, ice cream, and jams.|$|R
5000|$|A common Tico drink called [...] "agua dulce" [...] {{is made of}} tapa de dulce, or raw cane <b>sugar,</b> <b>dissolved</b> in hot water. This drink is {{particularly}} common in the cooler highlands and surrounding mountains of the country.|$|R
50|$|Here {{designs in}} a syrupy {{solution}} of sugar or Camp Coffee are painted onto the metal surface prior to it being coated in a liquid etching ground or 'stop out' varnish. When later the plate {{is placed in}} hot water the <b>sugar</b> <b>dissolves</b> and lifts off leaving the image. The plate can then be etched.|$|R
25|$|Historically {{the various}} stages were {{performed}} manually {{but the whole}} process is now automated for most wines. In connection with the filling of the missing volume, {{it is common to}} add a certain amount of <b>sugar</b> <b>dissolved</b> in wine to give the sparkling wine a smoother taste. Sugar addition is called dosage and the added liquid liqueur d'expedition.|$|R
5000|$|Complexation and {{solvation}} is {{also caused}} by specific interactions of functional groups. In the common {{rule of thumb}} [...] "like dissolves like", it is the shared or mutually well-interacting functional groups which give rise to solubility. For example, <b>sugar</b> <b>dissolves</b> in water because both share the hydroxyl functional group (-OH) and hydroxyls interact strongly with each other.|$|R
50|$|The {{blanketing}} of {{the sludge}} enables a dual solid and hydraulic (liquid) retention {{time in the}} digesters. Solids requiring {{a high degree of}} digestion can remain in the reactors for periods up to 90 days. <b>Sugars</b> <b>dissolved</b> in the liquid waste stream can be converted into gas quickly in the liquid phase which can exit the system in less than a day.|$|R

50|$|Typical {{ingredients}} of the melomakarono are flour or semolina, sugar, orange zest and/or fresh juice, cognac (or similar beverage), cinnamon and olive oil. During rolling {{they are often}} filled with ground walnuts. Immediately after baking, they are immersed {{for a few seconds}} in cold syrup made of honey and <b>sugar</b> <b>dissolved</b> in water. Finally, they are decorated with ground, as well as bigger pieces of walnut. Dark chocolate-covered melomakarona are also a more recent variation of the traditional recipe.|$|R

50|$|Many edible beans, {{including}} {{broad beans}} and soybeans, contain oligosaccharides (particularly raffinose and stachyose), {{a type of}} sugar molecule also found in cabbage. An anti-oligosaccharide enzyme is necessary to properly digest these sugar molecules. As a normal human digestive tract does not contain any anti-oligosaccharide enzymes, consumed oligosaccharides are typically digested by bacteria in the large intestine. This digestion process produces flatulence-causing gases as a byproduct. Since <b>sugar</b> <b>dissolves</b> in water, another method of reducing flatulence associated with eating beans is to drain the water in which the beans have been cooked.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Behaviorism {{dominated}} {{the field of}} SLA {{until the end of}} the 1960 s and found its most visible application in contrastive analysis and the audiolingual method (Johnson, 2004, p. 10). In this tradition, the focus was on the learner’s external environment. By now it is consensus that a mature psychology will contain a level of intermediate theory which bridges the divide between physiology and behavior, but there is disagreement over the best way to do that (Reisman, 2003). Now behaviorism is like a cube of <b>sugar</b> <b>dissolved</b> in tea; it has no major, distinct existence but it is everywhere (Harzem, 2004) ...|$|R

50|$|There is {{a common}} belief that {{superheating}} can occur only in pure substances. This is untrue, as superheating has been observed in coffee and other impure liquids. Impurities do prevent superheating if they introduce nucleation sites (rough areas where gas is trapped); for example, sand tends to suppress superheating in water. Dissolved gas can also provide nucleation sites {{when it comes out}} of solution and forms bubbles. However, an impurity such as salt or <b>sugar,</b> <b>dissolved</b> in water to form a homogeneous solution, does not prevent superheating. Other liquids are known to superheat including 2% milk and almond milk.|$|R

60|$|When {{he could}} look down again it was like looking down upon the crater of a small volcano. In the open garden before the Imperial castle a shuddering star of evil splendour spurted and poured up smoke and flame towards them like an accusation. They were too high to {{distinguish}} people clearly, or mark the bomb's effect upon the building until suddenly the facade tottered and crumbled before the flare as <b>sugar</b> <b>dissolves</b> in water. The man stared for a moment, showed all his long teeth, and then staggered into the cramped standing position his straps permitted, hoisted out and bit another bomb, and sent it down after its fellow.|$|R
50|$|Until the 1840s, punsch {{was served}} as a warm punch, created just before consumption: a sugarloaf was placed upright in a large bowl, hot water was poured over it to make the <b>sugar</b> <b>dissolve,</b> and arrack, unflavoured spirits and German Rhine wine was added. Still warm, the drink was then served in cups. However, in 1845 wine {{importing}} company J. Cederlunds Söner started selling premixed punsch in bottles, quickly followed by several other manufacturers, and the habit of drinking punsch cold as a liqueur began to take hold. However, on Thursdays, punsch is still traditionally served warm with Swedish pea & pork soup and pancakes.|$|R
5000|$|Based {{on these}} estimates, up to 75% {{of the oil}} from BP's Gulf oil {{disaster}} still remained in the Gulf environment, according to Christopher Haney, chief scientist for Defenders of Wildlife, who called the government report's conclusions misleading. Haney reiterated [...] "terms such as 'dispersed,' 'dissolved' and 'residual' do not mean gone. That's comparable to saying the <b>sugar</b> <b>dissolved</b> in my coffee is no longer there because I can't see it. By Director Lubchenco's own acknowledgment, the oil which is out of sight is not benign. [...] "Whether buried under beaches or settling on the ocean floor, residues from the spill will remain toxic for decades." ...|$|R
2500|$|Although {{saccharin}} was commercialized {{not long}} after its discovery, <b>until</b> <b>sugar</b> shortages during World War I, its use had not become widespread. Its popularity further increased during the 1960s and 1970s among dieters, since saccharin is a calorie-free sweetener. In the United States, saccharin is often found in restaurants in pink packets; the most popular brand is [...] "Sweet'n Low".|$|R
50|$|This mix can {{be stored}} {{for a long time}} at room {{temperature}} {{as long as it is}} sealed in an airtight container to prevent the moisture from soaking the sugar further. Whenever Anarsas are to be prepared, mash half inch piece of banana and mix into the previously prepared dough-balls. The banana ensures the <b>sugar</b> <b>dissolves</b> so be careful not to mix too much of banana. The resultant dough should be very soft yet retain shape. Small flat discs with about 2 inches in diameter are created by flattening a small ball of the dough over a layer of poppy seeds - just on one side. These disks are fried with poppy coated side first into hot ghee.|$|R
50|$|In cooking, a syrup or sirup (from شراب; sharāb, beverage, wine, via sirupus) is a {{condiment}} {{that is a}} thick, {{viscous liquid}} consisting primarily of a solution of sugar in water, containing {{a large amount of}} <b>dissolved</b> <b>sugars</b> but showing little tendency to deposit crystals. Its consistency {{is similar to that of}} molasses. The viscosity arises from the multiple hydrogen bonds between the <b>dissolved</b> <b>sugar,</b> which has many hydroxyl (OH) groups, and the water.|$|R
5|$|Traditional {{ice cream}} is frozen egg custard with {{flavours}} added. Blumenthal whisks egg yolks with <b>sugar</b> <b>until</b> the <b>sugar</b> {{interacts with the}} proteins in the yolk, creating a network of proteins. The entire substance turns white, at which point flavouring can be added and cooked in. While stirring the mixture, Blumenthal cools it {{as fast as possible}} using liquid nitrogen.|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} making panforte is fairly simple. <b>Sugar</b> is <b>dissolved</b> in honey and various nuts, fruits and spices are mixed {{together}} with flour. The entire mixture is baked in a shallow pan. The finished disc is dusted with icing sugar. Commercially produced panforte often have a band of rice-paper around the edge.|$|R
5000|$|The high {{green syrup}} {{is fed to a}} raw sugar vacuum pan {{from which a}} second batch of sugar is {{produced}}. This sugar ("raw") is of lower quality with more colour and impurities, and is the main source of the <b>sugar</b> <b>dissolved</b> again into the mother liquor. The syrup from the raw (Low green syrup) is boiled {{for a long time in}} AP Pans and sent to slowly flow around a series of about eight crystallisers. From this, a very low-quality sugar crystal is produced (known in some systems as [...] "AP sugar") that is also redissolved. The syrup separated is molasses, which still contains sugar, but contains too much impurity to undergo further processing economically. The molasses is stored on site and is added to dried beet pulp to make animal feed. Some is also sold in bulk tankers.|$|R
50|$|Poured fondant {{is formed}} by supersaturating water with sucrose. More {{than twice as}} much <b>sugar</b> will <b>dissolve</b> in water at the boiling point as will at room temperature. After the sucrose is dissolved, if the {{solution}} is left to cool undisturbed, the <b>sugar</b> will remain <b>dissolved</b> in a supersaturated solution until nucleation occurs. While the solution is supersaturated, if a seed crystal (undissolved sucrose) falls into the mix, or if the solution is agitated, the dissolved sucrose crystallizes to form large, crunchy crystals (which is how rock candy is made). However, if the solution is allowed to cool undisturbed, and then stirred vigorously, it forms many tiny crystals, resulting in a smooth textured fondant.|$|R
50|$|Allen {{believed}} that previous diabetic treatments had been ineffective because {{they attempted to}} substitute fats for carbohydrates. This eventually led to acidosis, followed by coma and death. Only a starvation diet that limited the total caloric consumption would be effective. Allen found that a liquids-only diet could eliminate glycosuria and acidosis. The diabetic could then begin to eat gradually increasing diets, <b>until</b> <b>sugar</b> again began {{to show up in}} the urine. This test would allow him to determine how many calories a patient could safely consume.|$|R
50|$|Treacle is {{made from}} the syrup that remains after sugar is refined. Raw sugars are first treated in a process called affination. When dissolved, the {{resulting}} liquor contains the minimum of dissolved non-sugars to be removed by treatment with activated carbon or bone char. The dark-coloured washings are treated separately, without carbon or bone char. They are boiled to grain (i.e. <b>until</b> <b>sugar</b> crystals precipitate out) in a vacuum pan, forming a low-grade massecuite (boiled mass) which is centrifuged, yielding a brown sugar and a liquid by-product—treacle.|$|R
40|$|Einstein's thesis ``A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions'' was {{the second}} of his five celebrated papers in 1905. Although it is [...] thanks to its {{widespread}} practical applications [...] the most quoted of his papers, it is less known than the other four. The main aim of the talk is to show what exactly Einstein did in his dissertation. As an important application of the theoretical results for the viscosity and diffusion of solutions, he got (after eliminating a calculational error) an excellent value for the Avogadro number from data for <b>sugar</b> <b>dissolved</b> in water.
