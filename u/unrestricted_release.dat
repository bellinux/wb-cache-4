50|$|Entombment (also {{referred}} to as safe enclosure) of a nuclear reactor is a method of nuclear decommissioning in which radioactive contaminants are encased in a structurally long-lived material, such as concrete, that will last {{for a period of}} time to ensure the remaining radioactivity is no longer of significant concern. Entombment is part of one of three various ways to decommission a nuclear power plant including: dismantling, safe enclosure and entombment. Nuclear entombment is the least used of the three options. The use of nuclear entombment is more practical for larger nuclear power plants that are in need of both long and short term burials. Entombment is used as a case by case basis because of its major commitment with years of surveillance and complexity until the radioactivity is no longer a major concern, permitting decommissioning and ultimate <b>unrestricted</b> <b>release</b> of the property.|$|E

The CAU includes one Corrective Action Site (CAS). The Area 25 Underground Storage Tanks, (CAS 25 - 02 - 01), referred to as the Engine-Maintenance Assembly and Disassembly (E-MAD) Waste Holdup Tanks and Vault, were used to receive liquid waste from all of the radioactive drains at the E-MAD Facility. Based on the results of the Corrective Action Investigation conducted in June 1999 discussed in the Corrective Action Investigation Plan for Corrective Action Unit 135 : Area 25 Underground Storage Tanks, Nevada Test Site, Nevada (DOE/NV, 1999 a), one sample from the radiological survey of the concrete vault interior exceeded radionuclide preliminary action levels.

40|$|To {{inform the}} Commission {{of the results}} of the staff’s {{assessment}} of potential doses to the public from residual radioactive material remaining at the Heritage Minerals Inc. (HMI) site, and to obtain Commission approval to terminate the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) license and release the site for unrestricted use. This paper does not address any new resource implications. SUMMARY: The radiological criteria for license termination specified in 10 CFR Part 20, Subpart E, do not apply for certain licensees with NRC-approved Decommissioning Plans (DPs) that are in accordance with the Site Decommissioning Management Plan (SDMP) Action Plan criteria. This paper discusses the decommissioning and related staff actions for such a site. The HMI site meets the cleanup criteria in its approved DP, but the resultant dose is greater than the radiological <b>unrestricted</b> <b>release</b> criterion of 25 millirem/year (mrem/yr). The Commission directed the staff to obtain Commission approval prior to releasing grandfathered sites when, after completing decommissioning, the dose from residual radioactivity exceeds the <b>unrestricted</b> <b>release</b> provision.

40|$|Therefore, {{the only}} {{alternative}} the staff considered is the no-action alternative, under which the staff would leave {{things as they are}} by simply denying the amendment request. This no-action alternative is not feasible because it conflicts with 10 CFR 30. 36 (d) requiring that decommissioning of byproduct material facilities be completed and approved by the NRC after licensed activities cease. The NRC’s analysis of the Licensee’s final status survey data confirmed that the Facility meets the requirements of 10 CFR 20. 1402 for <b>unrestricted</b> <b>release.</b> Additionally, denying the amendment request would result in no change in current environmental impacts. The environmental impacts of the proposed action and the no-action alternative are therefore similar, and the no-action alternative is accordingly not further considered. Conclusion The NRC staff has concluded that the proposed action is consistent with the NRC’s <b>unrestricted</b> <b>release</b> criteria specified in 10 CFR 20. 1402.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{question}} of whether a software vendor should allow users of unlicensed (pirated) copies of a software product to apply security patches. We present a joint model of network software security and software piracy and contrast two policies that a software vendor can enforce: (i) restriction of security patches only to legitimate users or (ii) provision of access to security patches to all users whether their copies are licensed or not. We find that when the software security risk is high and the piracy enforcement level is low, or when tendency for piracy in the consumer population is high, it is optimal for the vendor to restrict unlicensed users from applying security patches. When piracy tendency in the consumer population is low, applying software security patch restrictions is optimal for the vendor only when the piracy enforcement level is high. If patching costs are sufficiently low, however, an <b>unrestricted</b> patch <b>release</b> policy maximizes vendor profits. We also show that the vendor can use security patch restrictions as a substitute to investment in software security, and this effect can significantly reduce welfare. Finally, we demonstrate that although unrestricted patching can maximize welfare when the piracy enforcement level is low, contrary to what one might expect, when the piracy enforcement level is high, restricting security patches only to licensed users can be socially optimal...|$|R

The purpose of this Corrective Action Decision Document is to identify and provide a rationale for {{the selection of a}} recommended corrective action alternative for each corrective action site (CAS) within CAU 168. The corrective action investigation (CAI) was conducted in accordance with the ''Corrective Action Investigation Plan for Corrective Action Unit 168 : Area 25 and 26, Contaminated Materials and Waste Dumps, Nevada Test Site, Nevada'', as developed under the ''Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order'' (1996). Corrective Action Unit 168 is located in Areas 25 and 26 of the Nevada Test Site, Nevada and is comprised of the following 12 CASs: CAS 25 - 16 - 01, Construction Waste Pile; CAS 25 - 16 - 03, MX Construction Landfill; CAS 25 - 19 - 02, Waste Disposal Site; CAS 25 - 23 - 02, Radioactive Storage RR Cars; CAS 25 - 23 - 13, ETL - Lab Radioactive Contamination; CAS 25 - 23 - 18, Radioactive Material Storage; CAS 25 - 34 - 01, NRDS Contaminated Bunker; CAS 25 - 34 - 02, NRDS Contaminated Bunker; CAS 25 - 99 - 16, USW G 3; CAS 26 - 08 - 01, Waste Dump/Burn Pit; CAS 26 - 17 - 01, Pluto Waste Holding Area; and CAS 26 - 19 - 02, Contaminated Waste Dump No. 2. Analytes detected during the CAI were evaluated against preliminary action levels (PALs) to determine contaminants of concern (COCs) for CASs within CAU 168. Radiological measurements of railroad cars and test equipment were compared to <b>unrestricted</b> (free) <b>release</b> criteria. Assessment of the data generated from the CAI activities revealed the following: (1) Corrective Action Site 25 - 16 - 01 contains hydrocarbon-contaminated soil at concentrations exceeding the PAL. The contamination is at discrete locations associated with asphalt debris. (2) No COCs were identified at CAS 25 - 16 - 03. Buried construction waste is present in at least two disposal cells contained within the landfill boundaries. (3) No COCs were identified at CAS 25 - 19 - 02. (4) Radiological surveys at CAS 25 - 23 - 02 identified 13 railroad cars that exceeded the NV/YMP Radiological Control Manual limits for free release. Six railroad cars were below these limits and therefore met the free-release criteria. (5) An In-Situ Object Counting System survey taken at CAS 25 - 23 - 02 identified two railroad cars possibly containing fuel fragments; both exceeded the NV/YMP Radiological Control Manual free release criteria. (6) Corrective Action Site 25 - 23 - 18 contains total petroleum hydrocarbons-diesel-range organics, Aroclor- 1260, uranium- 234, uranium- 235, strontium- 90, and cesium- 137 that exceed PALs. (7) Radiological surveys at CAS 25 - 34 - 01 indicate that there were no total contamination readings that exceeded the NV/YMP Radiological Control Manual limits for free release. (8) Radiological surveys at CAS 25 - 34 - 02 indicate that there were no total contamination readings that exceeded the NV/YMP Radiological Control Manual limits for free release. (9) Radiological surveys at CAS 25 - 23 - 13 identified six pieces of equipment that exceed the NV/YMP Radiological Control Manual limits for free release.

Located in Area 25 at the Nevada Test Site in Nevada, CAU 254 is comprised of Corrective Action Site (CAS) 25 - 23 - 06, Decontamination Facility. A corrective action investigation for this CAS as conducted in January 2000 as {{set forth in the}} related Corrective Action Investigation Plan. Samples were collected from various media throughout the CAS and sent to an off-site laboratory for analysis. The laboratory results indicated the following: radiation dose rates inside the Decontamination Facility, Building 3126, and in the storage yard exceeded the average general dose rate; scanning and static total surface contamination surveys indicated that portions of the locker and shower room floor, decontamination bay floor, loft floor, east and west decon pads, north and south decontamination bay interior walls, exterior west and south walls, and loft walls were above preliminary action levels (PALs). The investigation-derived contaminants of concern (COCs) included: polychlorinated biphenyls, radionuclides (strontium- 90, niobium- 94, cesium- 137, uranium- 234 and - 235), total volatile and semivolatile organic compounds, total petroleum hydrocarbons, and total Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (Metals). During the investigation, two corrective action objectives (CAOs) were identified to prevent or mitigate human exposure to COCs. Based on these CAOs, a review of existing data, future use, and current operations at the Nevada Test Site, three CAAs were developed for consideration: Alternative 1 - No Further Action; Alternative 2 - <b>Unrestricted</b> <b>Release</b> Decontamination and Verification Survey; and Alternative 3 - <b>Unrestricted</b> <b>Release</b> Decontamination and Verification Survey and Dismantling of Building 3126. These alternatives were evaluated based on four general corrective action standards and five remedy selection decision factors, and the preferred CAA chosen on technical merit was Alternative 2.

CAU 135 consists of three Corrective Action Sites (CAS). Two of these CAS's were identified in the Corrective Action Investigation Data Quality Objective meeting as being improperly identified as underground storage tanks. CAS 25 - 02 - 03 identified as the Deluge Valve Pit was actually an underground electrical vault and CAS 25 - 02 - 10 identified as an Underground Storage Tank was actually a former above ground storage tank filled with demineralized water. Both of these CAS's are recommended for a no further action closure. CAS 25 - 02 - 01 the Underground Storage Tanks commonly referred to as the Engine Maintenance Assembly and Disassembly Waste Holdup Tanks and Vault was closed by decontaminating the vault structure and conducting a radiological verification survey to document compliance with the Nevada Test Site unrestricted use release criteria. The Area 25 Underground Storage Tanks, (CAS 25 - 02 - 01), referred to as the Engine Maintenance, Assembly, and Disassembly (E-MAD) Waste Holdup Tanks and Vault, were used to receive liquid waste from all of the radioactive and cell service area drains at the E-MAD Facility. Based on the results of the Corrective Action Investigation conducted in June 1999, discussed in ''The Corrective Action Investigation Plan for Corrective Action Unit 135 : Area 25 Underground Storage Tanks, Nevada Test Site, Nevada'' (DOE/NV, 199 a), one sample from the radiological survey of the concrete vault interior exceeded radionuclide preliminary action levels. The analytes from the sediment samples exceeded the preliminary action levels for polychlorinated biphenyls, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act metals, total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel-range organics, and radionuclides. The CAU 135 closure activities consisted of scabbling radiological ''hot spots'' from the concrete vault, and the drilling removal of the cement-lined vault sump. Field activities began on November 28, 2000, and ended on December 4, 2000. After verification samples were collected, the vault was repaired with cement. The concrete vault sump, soil excavated beneath the sump, and compactable hot line trash were disposed at the Area 23 Sanitary Landfill.

The Program {{establishes the}} criteria {{that will be}} used by all ORNL divisions, offices, and programs for <b>unrestricted</b> <b>release</b> of hazardous waste to off-site commercial facilities. The certification process meets the requirements given in the Performance Objective for Certification of Non-Radioactive Hazardous Waste. The Program Plan has two main elements: (A) Establishing Radioactive Materials Management Areas (RMMAs). At ORNL, RMMAs are (1) Contamination Areas, High Contamination Areas, and Airborne Radioactivity Areas, (2) Radiological Buffer Areas established for contamination control, and (3) areas posted to prevent loss of control of activated items. (B) Certifying that hazardous waste originating in an RMMA is suitable for commercial treatment, storage, or disposal by process knowledge, surface contamination surveys, sampling and analysis, or a combination of these techniques. If process knowledge is insufficient, the hazardous waste must undergo sampling and analysis in addition to surface contamination surveys. This Program will reduce the impact to current ORNL operations by using current radiological area boundaries and existing plans and procedures to the greatest extent possible.

40|$|This {{letter is}} to request an {{amendment}} to the Danforth Center Category 3 M license, NRC License Number 24 - 32339 - 0 I, authorizing <b>unrestricted</b> <b>release</b> of the Radioactive Waste Storage Module of Hazardous Materials Storage Building so that said building may be demolished. The building containing the Radioactive Waste Storage Module is located on the Danforth Center Campus at 975 North Warson Road, St. Louis, MO 63132 (Site Plan attached). We respectfuIlv request expeditious review of this amendment request as the building demolition is required to create space for a new Greenhouse to be imminently constructed on this tract and land adjacent. The Radioactive Waste Storage Module of Hazardous Materials Storage Building has been in use since 200 1. The module was never used as a “radioactive materials use area”; no sources were ever opened in the module; the module was used exclusively to store pre-packaged, sealed waste containers for DIS or for shipment for ultimate disposal. Licensed activities have ceased and the module has undergone decommissioning conducted under the Danforth Center Materials License by Chase Environmental Group, Inc. and in accordance with a Decommissioning Work Plan (DWP) developed using the guidance provided in NUREG 1757...|$|E
40|$|The National Center of Excellence for Metals Recycle (NMR) is the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) complex-wide {{source for}} aggressively {{pursuing}} recycle and reuse of scrap and surplus metals. Established in September 1997, {{this program is}} designed to educate, promote, and facilitate recycling and reuse of metal. The vision of the program is to cultivate a DOE culture that considers the recycle and reuse of metal as the first and primary disposition option and burial as a last option, while reducing environmental and health risks and life cycle costs. NMR takes the approach that <b>unrestricted</b> <b>release</b> of metal is the first priority because it is the most cost-effective and environmentally-sound disposition pathway. Where this is not appropriate, restricted release, beneficial reuse, and stockpile of ingots are considered. The {{program is designed to}} assist project managers in identifying and expediting recycling activities and will provide tools to facilitate the recycling/reuse process. NMR understands what motivates DOE project managers: meeting schedules, staying within budget, and satisfying regulatory requirements. NMR is developing tools to assist project managers in evaluating methods to reduce costs and schedules by recycling and reusing equipment and materials. Thes...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} the {{feasibility}} of recycling and/or reuse of non-releasable components and materials arising from nuclear operations within the European Community has been undertaken. This review has comprised of {{an estimate of the}} amounts of low-level waste concrete, steel, copper and aluminium which may arise from routine operations and decommissioning of nuclear facilities around the EC and the timescales on which this material would arise. Detailed studies of twelve possible scenarios for utilisation of this material have been carried out and from the results of these analyses a strategic evaluation of the feasibility of controlled release recycling within the nuclear sector has been made. The study concludes that the recycling of radioactive steels (carbon and stainless) is an already well researched area which requires no further development as regards the melting and refining of steel arising from nuclear facilities. Work within the nuclear sector has been driven by efforts to allow <b>unrestricted</b> <b>release</b> of this material into the conventional market-place and in general any restricted release into the nuclear sector is carried out according to legislation in the country concerned preventing its sale as scrap. Further development of controlled release recycling of steels into products from plate will be likely driven by market forces sinc...|$|E
40|$|At {{the request}} of the USDOE, a team from ORNL {{conducted}} an independent radiological verification survey at the former Bridgeport Brass Company Facility, Seymour, Connecticut, from September 1992 to March 1993. Purpose of the survey was to determine whether residual levels of radioactivity inside the Ruffert Building and selected adjacent areas were rmediated to levels below DOE guidelines for FUSRAP sites. The property was contaminated with radioactive residues of {sup 238 }U from uranium processing experiments conducted by Reactive Metals, Inc., from 1962 to 1964 for the Atomic Energy Commission. A previous radiological survey did not characterize the entire floor space because equipment which could not be moved at the time made it inaccessible for radiological surveys. During the remediation process, additional areas of elevated radioactivity were discovered under stationary equipment, which required additional remediation and further verification. Results of the independent radiological verification survey confirm that, {{with the exception of the}} drain system inside the building, residual uranium contamination has been remediated to levels below DOE guidelines for <b>unrestricted</b> <b>release</b> of property at FUSRAP sites inside and outside the Ruffert Building. However, certain sections of the drain system retain uranium contamination above DOE surface guideline levels. These sections of pipe are addressed in separate, referenced documentation...|$|E

The guidelines {{are intended to}} protect workers from injury by the unexpected and <b>unrestricted</b> <b>release</b> of energy due to pressure, gravity, springs, electrical release, and thermal energy resulting from high or low temperatures. Accident reports are analyzed and categorized by fire, explosion, impact, fall, caught between, or others. The major identified hazard causes include maintenance activities initiated without deactivation of the equipment or system; inadequate energy blockage or isolation; failure to dissipate residual energy; and accidental activation of energy. A systems analysis approach is used to provide a logical system for performing maintenance and servicing activities safely. The logic tree provides a step by step diagram {{for controlling}} hazardous energy that {{should be used in}} the formulation of specific maintenance and servicing procedures. The authors indicate that existing Federal and State safety regulations of energy control during maintenance, with the exception of Michigan and California, are inconsistent.

40|$|Dear Mr. Mendonca: Pursuant to {{telephone}} conversations between your office and Georgia Tech these past two weeks, Georgia Tech has pursued the 10 CTR 50. 59 process as the proper change method {{to adopt the}} NRC Policy Issue (ref 1) for the <b>unrestricted</b> <b>release</b> limits for tritium and iron- 55. The change addresses the final release standards of these hard-to-detect radioisotopes. The Georgia Tech Technical Safety Review Committee used the- 10 CFR 50. 59 process to establish a 200, 000 dpm/ 100 cm 2 total surface contamination limit and a 40, 000 dpm/ 100 cm 2 removable for tritium and iron- 55. The 10 CFR 50. 59 evaluation did not highlight any unreviewed safety questions. It is our understanding that the NRC Confirmatory Survey of the facility {{at the completion of}} decontaminating and decommissioning project will utilize our 10 CJR 50. 59 evaluation {{as the basis for the}} execution of their confirmatory survey.

40|$|Safety {{and cost}} {{information}} is {{developed for the}} conceptual decommissioning of a commercial uranium hexafluoride conversion (UF{sub 6 }) plant. Two basic decommissioning alternatives are studied to obtain comparisons between cost and safety impacts: DECON, and passive SAFSTOR. A third alternative, DECON of the plant and equipment with stabilization and long-term care of lagoon wastes. is also examined. DECON includes the immediate removal (following plant shutdown) of all radioactivity in excess of <b>unrestricted</b> <b>release</b> levels, with subsequent release of the site for public use. Passive SAFSTOR requires decontamination, preparation, maintenance, and surveillance {{for a period of}} time after shutdown, followed by deferred decontamination and <b>unrestricted</b> <b>release.</b> DECON with stabilization and long-term care of lagoon wastes (process wastes generated at the reference plant and stored onsite during plant operation} is also considered as a decommissioning method, although its acceptability has not yet been determined by the NRC. The decommissioning methods assumed for use in each decommissioning alternative are based on state-of-the-art technology. The elapsed time following plant shutdown required to perform the decommissioning work in each alternative is estimated to be: for DECON, 8 months; for passive SAFSTOR, 3 months to prepare the plant for safe storage and 8 months to accomplish deferred decontamination. Planning and preparation for decommissioning prior to plant shutdown is estimated to require about 6 months for either DECON or passive SAFSTOR. Planning and preparation prior to starting deferred decontamination is estimated to require an additional 6 months. OECON with lagoon waste stabilization is estimated to take 6 months for planning and about 8 months to perform the decommissioning work. Decommissioning cost, in 1981 dollars, is estimated to be $ 5. 91 million for OECON. For passive SAFSTOR, preparing the facility for safe storage is estimated to cost $ 0. 88 million, the annual maintenance and surveillance cost is estimated to be about $ 0. 095 million, and deferred decontamination is estimated to cost about $ 6. 50 million. Therefore, passive SAFSTOR for 10 years is estimated to cost $ 8. 33 million in nondiscounted 1981 dollars. DECON with lagoon waste stabilization is estimated to cost about $ 4. 59 million, with an annual cost of $ 0. 011 million for long-term care. All of these estimates include a 25 % contingency. Waste management costs for DECON, including the net cost of disposal of the solvent extraction lagoon wastes by shipping those wastes to a uranium mill for recovery of residual uranium, comprise about 38 % of the total decommissioning cost. Disposal of lagoon waste at a commercial low-level waste burial ground is estimated to add $ 10. 01 million to decommissioning costs. Safety analyses indicate that radiological and nonradiological safety impacts from decommissioning activities should be small. The 50 -year committed dose equivalent to members of the public from airborne releases during normal decommissioning activities is estimated to &#x 27;Je about 4. 0 man-rem. Radiation doses to the public from accidents are found to be very low for all phases of decommissioning. Occupational radiation doses from normal decommissioning operations (excluding transport operations) are estimated to be about 79 man-rem for DECON and about 80 man-rem for passive SAFSTOR with 10 years of safe storage. Doses from DECON with lagoon waste stabilization are about the same as for DECON except there is less dose resulting from transportation of radioactive waste. The number of fatalities and serious lost-time injuries not related to radiation is found to be very small for all decommissioning alternatives. Comparison of the cost estimates shows that DECON with lagoon waste stabilization is the least expensive method. However, this alternative does not allow <b>unrestricted</b> <b>release</b> of the site. The cumulative cost of maintenance and surveillance and the higher cost of deferred decontamination makes passive SAFSTOR more expensive than DECON. Several methods to assure that the licensee has adequate funds for decommissioning are considered. The methods investigated (all based on expected decommissioning costs) range from a single payment when plant operations begin, to payments into a sinking fund during the normal plant operating period, to a single payment when normal plant operations cease and decommissioning begins...|$|E
