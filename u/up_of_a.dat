5|$|Describing {{the system}} in November 1988, Cray stated that the 12 times {{performance}} increase would be made <b>up</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> three times increase due to GaAs circuits, and four times due {{to the use of}} more processors. One of the problems with the Cray-2 had been poor multiprocessing performance due to limited bandwidth between the processors, and to address this the Cray-3 would adopt the much faster architecture used in the Cray Y-MP. This would provide a design performance of 8000 MIPS, or 16 GFLOPS.|$|E
