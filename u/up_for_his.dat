5|$|After {{catching}} {{very few}} passes {{in high school}} and college, Berry was drafted in the 20th round of the 1954 NFL Draft by the Colts and was considered a long shot to even make the team's roster. Diminutive and unassuming, his subsequent rise to the Pro Football Hall of Fame has been touted as one of American football's Cinderella stories. He made <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> lack of athleticism through rigorous practice and attention to detail, and was known for his near-perfect route running and sure handedness. Berry was a favorite target of quarterback Johnny Unitas, and the two were regarded as the dominant passing and receiving duo of their era.|$|E

Buffalo recovered for the fifth time, {{but was unable to}} score, punting to ball back to UConn with 4:37 left in the half. Brown made <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> earlier mistake by breaking off a 75-yard run before being caught from behind. On the next play Tyler Lorenzen ran the ball into the end zone from 13yards out. Neither team scored {{for the remainder of the}} first half, making the score 20–17 Buffalo going into halftime.|$|E

5|$|Considerably {{shorter than}} the average footballer at 5ft 7in, Gibbs made <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> {{physical}} disadvantage with positional play, determination, accurate tackling, and staying on his feet. Although a defender, his lack of goals (7 in 491 appearances) and reluctance to get forward were often remarked upon. Gibbs refuted the suggestion that he didn't attack enough, while former managers Roeder and Taylor both considered Gibbs to be an excellent crosser of the ball when he did venture forward. He scored his first professional goal during his 59th game. By comparison, Gibbs' long-term successor at right-back, Lloyd Doyley, scored his first professional goal on his 269th appearance.|$|E

He finished the season ranked fourth in the country. In 1973, in just his second season as an expert, Roberts won the national championship, amassing a record 2,014 points in the 25-race series.|$|E

In a March game at Georgetown, McNamara missed a free-throw with 10 seconds left that allowed the Hoyas to force {{overtime}}. Until that point, McNamara had been a perfect 41-for-41 in conference play. However, McNamara made <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> miss, hitting two 3-pointers and adding another jumper in an 11-3 run to start overtime as Syracuse beat Mike Sweetney and the Georgetown Hoyas, 93-84. Ten of McNamara's 22 came in the extra frame.|$|E
5|$|The Falcons {{had trouble}} moving {{the ball at}} first, but were helped by a 15-yard {{personal}} foul penalty against Virginia Tech that gave them a first down. Weiss completed a pass that gave the Falcons another first down and drove Air Force inside Tech territory. On the first play within Hokie territory, Weiss fumbled the ball, but fell {{on it for a}} loss, and Air Force retained possession. Weiss made <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> fumble two plays later when he scrambled for a first down that kept the drive going. Despite that effort, Tech was able to force a stop and Air Force punted with 3:10 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

Orton was able to recover, and performed a rope hung DDT on Edge.

Edge followed him, trying to perform the spear, but Orton was able to avoid it, and Edge hit the barricade. Neither man was able to return to the ring before the count of ten, and as a result, the match ended in a double countout.|$|E

5|$|But Thorpe had not {{abandoned}} football either. He first played {{professional football}} in 1913 {{as a member}} of the Indiana-based Pine Village Pros, a team that had a several-season winning streak against local teams during the 1910s. He then signed with the Canton Bulldogs in 1915. They paid him $250 ($ today) a game, a tremendous wage at the time. Before signing him Canton was averaging 1,200fans a game, but 8,000 showed <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> debut against the Massillon Tigers. The team won titles in 1916, 1917, and 1919. He reportedly ended the 1919 championship game by kicking a wind-assisted 95-yard punt from his team's own 5-yard line, effectively putting the game out of reach. In 1920, the Bulldogs were one of 14teams to form the American Professional Football Association (APFA), which would become the National Football League (NFL) two years later. Thorpe was nominally the APFA's first president, but spent most of the year playing for Canton and a year later was replaced as president by Joseph Carr. He continued to play for Canton, coaching the team as well. Between 1921 and 1923, he helped organize and played for the Oorang Indians (LaRue, Ohio), an all-Native American team. Although the team's record was 3–6 in 1922, and 1–10 in 1923, he played well and was selected for the Green Bay Press-Gazette's first All-NFL team in 1923, which would later be formally recognized by the NFL as the league's official All-NFL team in 1931).|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Johnson {{was called}} <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> native Jamaica by Brazilian coach René Simões. He made his debut against Trinidad and Tobago on 28 March, coming on as a half-time {{substitute}} for Paul Hall in a 2–0 loss in Port of Spain, and then scored in a 3–0 victory over Paraguay in Kingston three days later, after coming on for Ricardo Fuller at half-time. He made another substitute appearance in May 1999, coming on for Theodore Whitmore in the 56th minute of Jamaica's 2–1 friendly defeat to Sweden in Stockholm. Another appearance followed in September 1999, with Johnson again replacing Whitmore {{shortly after the}} hour mark of Jamaica's 2–2 draw with the United States; Johnson scored Jamaica's second goal in the 79th minute. Despite appearing four times for Jamaica in friendly games, he was still eligible to play for another national team as FIFA's regulations at the time did not bind players to a nation until they had played a competitive game.|$|E
5|$|McCall played {{football}} for Upper Wortley Primary School and Thornhill Middle School, even scoring a winning {{goal for the}} latter in a cup final when he came on as a substitute with his arm in a sling. While McCall also played table tennis as a schoolboy, football was a focus, and he captained the Leeds under-11 boys team and played for other Leeds representative sides. McCall's parents split and he made <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> size {{when he moved to}} one of Leeds' toughest estates and played for pub sides by the age of 14. He moved schools to Harrington High and also played for local young sides Pudsey Juniors, Holbeck and later Farsley Celtic. McCall thought he had missed his chance of playing professionally after a string of other players were signed by professional clubs, until Farsley played Bradford City's junior side in a friendly and he impressed coach Bryan Edwards enough to be asked for a trial.|$|E

In the {{semifinal}} of the tournament, Brewer scored Canada's first goal of the game in 4–3 overtime victory against the Czech Republic. Team Canada would go on to win the tournament on home ice in Toronto, defeating Finland 3–2 in the final. Just under one year following his World Cup appearance, Brewer {{was named to}} the orientation camp for the Canadian team at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy held from August 15–20, 2005, in Vancouver and Kelowna, British Columbia. Following the camp, on October 18, 2005, Brewer {{was named to the}} preliminary 81-man Canadian roster for the tournament. However, when the final roster was announced on December 21, 2005, Brewer was not among the 26 players listed. As a result, it would be nearly three years before Brewer would next suit <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> country, when on April 3, 2007, Brewer was among the first five players named to play for Canada at the 2007 IIHF World Championship in Moscow and Mytishchi, Russia. For the tournament, Brewer was named as the team's only permanent alternate captain and helped the team to its third gold medal at the tournament in the past five years.|$|E

Prez has begun a new career as a mathematics teacher at the same school. The cold-blooded Marlo has come to dominate the streets of the west side, using murder and intimidation to make <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> weak-quality drugs and lack of business acumen. His enforcers Chris Partlow and Snoop conceal their numerous victims in abandoned and boarded-up row houses where the bodies will not be readily discovered. The disappearances of so many known criminals come to mystify both the major crimes unit investigating Marlo and the homicide unit assigned to solve the presumed murders. Marlo coerces Bodie into working under him.|$|E
5|$|The retiarius was {{routinely}} {{pitted against}} a heavily armed secutor. The net-fighter made <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> lack of protective gear by using his speed and agility to avoid his opponent's attacks {{and waiting for}} the opportunity to strike. He first tried to throw his net over his rival. If this succeeded, he attacked with his trident while his adversary was entangled. Another tactic was to ensnare his enemy's weapon in the net and pull it out of his grasp, leaving the opponent defenseless. Should the net miss or the secutor grab hold of it, the retiarius likely discarded the weapon, although he might try to collect it back for a second cast. Usually, the retiarius had to rely on his trident and dagger to finish the fight. The trident, as tall as a human being, permitted the gladiator to jab quickly and keep his distance. It was a strong weapon, capable of inflicting piercing wounds on an unprotected skull or limb. The dagger was the retiariuss final backup should the trident be lost. It was reserved for when close combat or a straight wrestling match had to settle the bout. In some battles, a single retiarius faced two secutores simultaneously. For these situations, the lightly armoured gladiator was placed on a raised platform and given a supply of stones with which to repel his pursuers.|$|E
