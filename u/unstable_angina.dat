5|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} {{is also known}} as ischemic heart disease, is caused by {{atherosclerosis}} – a build-up of plaque along the inner walls of the arteries which narrows them, reducing the blood flow to the heart. A stable plaque may cause chest pain (angina) or breathlessness during exercise or at rest, or no symptoms at all. A ruptured plaque can block a blood vessel and lead to ischaemia of the heart muscle, causing <b>unstable</b> <b>angina</b> or a heart attack. In the worst case this may cause cardiac arrest, a sudden and utter loss of output from the heart. Obesity, high blood pressure, uncontrolled diabetes, smoking and high cholesterol can all increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To analyse the {{prodrome}} {{of acute}} myocardial infarction {{in relation to the}} plaque morphology underlying the infarct.  DESIGN—A retrospective investigation of the relation between rupture and erosion of coronary atheromatous plaques and the clinical characteristics of {{acute myocardial infarction}}. The coronary arteries of 100  patients who died from acute myocardial infarction were cut transversely at 3  mm intervals. Segments with a stenosis were examined microscopically at 5  µm intervals. The clinical features of the infarction were obtained from the medical records.  RESULTS—A deep intimal rupture was encountered in 81  plaques, whereas 19  had superficial erosions only. There were no differences in the location of infarction, the incidence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or hyperlipidaemia, diameter stenosis of the infarcted related artery, Killip class, Forrester's haemodynamic subset, or peak creatine kinase between plaque rupture and plaque erosion groups. The presence of plaque rupture was associated with significantly greater incidences of leucocytosis, current smoking, and sudden or unstable onset of acute coronary syndrome. In patients with <b>unstable</b> preinfarction <b>angina,</b> new onset rest angina rather than worsening angina tended to develop more often in the plaque rupture group than in the plaque erosion group (p =  0. 08).  CONCLUSIONS—Plaque rupture causes the sudden onset of acute myocardial infarction or <b>unstable</b> preinfarction <b>angina,</b> which may be aggravated by smoking and inflammation.    Keywords: acute coronary syndrome; plaque rupture; white blood cell; preinfarction angin...|$|R

25|$|Worsening angina attacks, sudden-onset angina at rest, and angina lasting {{more than}} 15 minutes are {{symptoms}} of <b>unstable</b> <b>angina</b> (usually grouped with similar conditions as the acute coronary syndrome).

25|$|In {{the setting}} of acute chest pain, the {{electrocardiogram}} is the investigation that most reliably distinguishes between various causes. The ECG should be done as early as practicable, including in the ambulance if possible. If this indicates acute heart damage (elevation in the ST segment, new left bundle branch block), treatment for {{a heart attack in}} the form of angioplasty or thrombolysis is indicated immediately (see below). In the absence of such changes, {{it is not possible to}} immediately distinguish between <b>unstable</b> <b>angina</b> and NSTEMI.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{coronary}} syndrome (ACS) is a syndrome (set {{of signs}} and symptoms) due to decreased blood {{flow in the}} coronary arteries such {{that part of the}} heart muscle is unable to function properly or dies. The most common symptom is chest pain, often radiating to the left shoulder or angle of the jaw, crushing, central and associated with nausea and sweating. Acute coronary syndrome is usually caused by one of three problems: ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI, 30%), non ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI, 25%), or <b>unstable</b> <b>angina</b> (38%).|$|E
40|$|Angina from {{coronary}} artery spasm is not rare. Because new and effective medical therapy is now available, {{it is imperative that}} the physician recognize this syndrome when it occurs.

40|$|Several autopsy studies {{indicate}} that disrupted atherosclerotic plaques particularly those rich in lipid with associated thrombus. are the cause of acute MI. Other plaques without disruption are fibrocellular without lipid. Although <b>unstable</b> rest <b>angina</b> (UA) shares a common pathogenesis to acute MI, there are little pathological data on plaque composition in UA. Directional Coronary Atherectomy (DCA) provides the opportunity to study plaque composition in UA. MethodsWe prospectively analyzed the DCA tissue specimens of 60 pts with de novo culprit lesions for fibrocellular and lipid constituents by hematoxylin & eosin and oil red O stains. A fibrous plaque (FP) was defined as one which had predominantly fibrous and sclerotic tissue with no or minimallipid (0 or 1 +on scale of 3). A lipid plaque (LP) was defined as one with moderate or high lipid (2 or 3 +) content. The presence of inflammatory cells and thrombus were also noted. Histopathology was analyzed independent of clinical presentation.

Inflammatory cells were noted in 12 LP and 2 FP (p= 0. 02) — in 38 % of both rest angina and post MI specimens. ConclusionsLipid rich plaque are very common in rest angina and post MI, moderately common in crescendo or new onset and rare in stable angina. LP are usually associated with thrombus and inflammation particularly in rest angina and post MI pts.

25|$|If an MI is {{presented}} with ECG {{evidence of an}} ST elevation known as STEMI, or if a bundle branch block is similarly presented, then reperfusion therapy is necessary. In {{the absence of an}} ST elevation, a non-ST elevation MI, known as an NSTEMI, or an <b>unstable</b> <b>angina</b> may be presumed (both of these are indistinguishable on initial evaluation of symptoms). ST elevations indicate a completely blocked artery needing immediate reperfusion. In NSTEMI the blood flow is present but limited by stenosis. In NSTEMI the same thrombolytics are used as for STEMI, but they are also often stabilised with antiplatelets and anticoagulants. If the condition stays stable a cardiac stress test may be offered, and if needed subsequent revascularization will be carried out to restore a normal blood flow. If the blood flow becomes unstable an urgent angioplasty may be required. In these unstable cases the use of thrombolytics is contraindicated.|$|E

DESIGN [...] Retrospective review of coronary angioplasties and complications {{in a hospital}} without on site cardiac surgical cover. SETTING [...] All angioplasties were performed in the catheterisation laboratory of the Belfast City Hospital. Revascularisation surgery for complicated coronary angioplasty was performed in the cardiac surgical unit of the Royal Victoria Hospital, 2. 4 km away from the catheterisation laboratory. PATIENTS [...] 540 Coronary angioplasties were performed on 512 patients between late 1982 and November 1988. Indications included stable <b>angina,</b> <b>unstable</b> rest <b>angina,</b> and suitable coronary disease at coronary arteriography after myocardial infarction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] In hospital mortality after complicated coronary angioplasty and delay to surgical revascularisation after acute coronary occlusion at angioplasty. RESULTS [...] Coronary angioplasty was successful in 444 cases (82 %). Acute coronary occlusion occurred in 35 cases (6. 5 %). Twelve patients required urgent revascularisation surgery and were transferred safely to the surgical unit; none of these patients died. A mean delay of 268 minutes (range 180 - 390 minutes) occurred before revascularisation compared with 273 minutes (range 108 - 420 minutes) in the Royal Victoria Hospital, where on site surgical cover was available. The principal cause of delay was the wait for a cardiac operating theatre to become available and not the transfer time between hospitals. Five deaths occurred after coronary angioplasty, a mortality of 0. 9 %. Three deaths were related to acute coronary occlusion. The absence of immediate surgical help did not influence the outcome in any patient. CONCLUSION [...] With careful selection of patients coronary angioplasty may be safely performed in a hospital without on site cardiac surgical facilities, provided that these are available at a nearby centre...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} myocardial viability (inotropic reserve) after myocardial infarction (MI) {{and its relationship}} with the presence of <b>unstable</b> pre-infarction <b>angina</b> (PIA). BACKGROUNDSeveral studies have suggested that PIA can limit infarct size, but it is not known whether PIA can elicit myocardial viability after an acute MI, with left ventricular function improvement. METHODSBefore discharge from the hospital, 91 patients with a reperfused MI (either fibrinolysis or primary coronary angioplasty) had low-dose dobutamine echocardiography performed to assess the myocardial inotropic reserve of the infarct-related area. RESULTSTwenty-nine patients (31. 9 %) had PIA in the 24 -h period before the onset of MI. Nine patients were treated with primary coronary angioplasty: five (8. 1 %) in the group with PIA and four (13. 8 %) in the group without PIA. There were no other significant differences in the baseline characteristics of the patients. There were more viable segments in patients with PIA (44. 9 % vs. 30. 7 %, p = 0. 007), and the number of patients with significant viability was higher in the PIA group (73. 9 % vs. 46. 3 %, p = 0. 026). This occurred despite a similar number of segments with segmental wall abnormalities at baseline in both groups (46. 1 % vs. 46. 9 %, p = NS). CONCLUSIONSThe presence of previous unstable PIA induces greater myocardial viability of the infarct-related area upon reperfusion and, as such, could have considerable therapeutic and clinical implications...|$|R
