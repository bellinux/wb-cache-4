30|$|ANSYS is {{a finite}} element {{modelling}} and analysis tool {{to solve the}} underlying governing equations and the associated problem-specific boundary conditions (ANSYS 8 0 <b>User</b> <b>s</b> <b>Guide).</b> It is always preferred to investigate the depillaring problem in a three-dimensional simulated model because depillaring is, basically a three-dimensional problem. But many items, the broken and jig-jag nature of the depillaring face becomes too complex to correctly simulated even in a three dimensional model. It is clearly due to {{the vastness of the}} problem, as the bigger model consumes more time and computer resources, which is likely to increase by a factor of 10 or more in going from two to three dimensions. With this consideration, simple two dimensional case of the geo-mining conditions of the sites were simulated to understand development of mining induced stress ahead of a depillaring face and the variation of safety factor of the pillar (facing goaf line) (Singh 2004).|$|E

The task of tuning trajectory-determination models for interplanetary navigation is complex, requiring an intensive search of multiple dynamical and nondynamical models that yield trajectory solutions with minimal errors. By automating the search, ADAPT eases the task of human analysts and enables them to consider wider ranges of potential solutions. ADAPT uses genetic algorithms to search a range of relevant parameters in a user-selected design space to arrive at values for those parameters that best fit the measured spacecraft-tracking data. The <b>user</b> <b>s</b> <b>guide</b> for ADAPT reviews the theoretical basis {{of the program and}} presents two example applications. One example is that of selecting a solar-radiation model for the Mars Pathfinder (MPF) mission using MPF tracking data and an extended Kalman filter from prior spacecraft-navigation software.

Developed by African and European institutes, together with development agencies, farmers, researchers and field workers, the package explains ways of gathering, managing and analysing information through participatory learning and action research (PLAR). 'The objective is not to achieve the scientifically best solution to maintain soil fertility, but to find one that is practical, applicable and adapted to the individual farmer s specific situation. ' Part 1 helps the user to analyse farming situations and enables farmers to learn new techniques and to link scientific and farmers knowledge. In Part 2, case studies from Benin, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali and Tanzania show how PLAR and nutrient flow analysis help to understand specific situations and plan new ways of farming. Tools are set out on laminated cards in Part 3 to help the user work with farmers. Part 4, a software package on CD-ROM, helps with the management of data collected during this process. The CD-ROM also contains electronic versions of the detailed field tools and <b>user</b> <b>s</b> <b>guide</b> found in Part 5, the manual, together with interview and recording forms.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{work performed}} by MTC Technologies (MTCT) for NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) under Contract NAS 3 - 00178, Task Order No. 15. MTCT previously developed a first-generation empirical model that correlates the core/combustion noise of four GE engines, the CF 6, CF 34, CFM 56, and GE 90 for General Electric (GE) under Contract No. 200 - 1 X- 14 W 53048, {{in support of}} GRC Contract NAS 3 - 01135. MTCT has demonstrated in earlier noise modeling efforts that the improvement of predictive modeling is greatly enhanced by an iterative approach, so in support of NASA's Quiet Aircraft Technology Project, GRC sponsored this effort to improve the model. Since the noise data available for correlation are total engine noise spectra, it is total engine noise that must be predicted. Since {{the scope of this}} effort was not sufficient to explore fan and turbine noise, the most meaningful comparisons must be restricted to frequencies below the blade passage frequency. Below the blade passage frequency and at relatively high power settings jet noise {{is expected to be the}} dominant source, and comparisons are shown that demonstrate the accuracy of the jet noise model recently developed by MTCT for NASA under Contract NAS 3 - 00178, Task Order No. 10. At lower power settings the core noise became most apparent, and these data corrected for the contribution of jet noise were then used to establish the characteristics of core noise. There is clearly more than one spectral range where core noise is evident, so the spectral approach developed by von Glahn and Krejsa in 1982 wherein four spectral regions overlap, was used in the GE effort. Further analysis indicates that the two higher frequency components, which are often somewhat masked by turbomachinery noise, can be treated as one component, and it is on that basis that the current model is formulated. The frequency scaling relationships are improved and are now based on combustor and core nozzle geometries. In conjunction with the Task Order No. 10 jet noise model, this core noise model is shown to provide statistical accuracy comparable to the jet noise model for frequencies below blade passage. This model is incorporated in the NASA FOOTPR code and a <b>user</b> <b>s</b> <b>guide</b> is provided...|$|E
40|$|The RWDMES is a {{tool for}} {{modeling}} the disturbances imparted on spacecraft by spinning reaction wheels. Reaction wheels are usually the largest disturbance source on a precision pointing spacecraft, and can be the dominating source of pointing error. Accurate knowledge of the disturbance environment is critical to accurate prediction of the pointing performance. In the past, it {{has been difficult to}} extract an accurate wheel disturbance model since the forcing mechanisms are difficult to model physically, and the forcing amplitudes are filtered by the dynamics of the reaction wheel. RWDMES captures the wheel-induced disturbances using a hybrid physical/empirical model that is extracted directly from measured forcing data. The empirical models capture the tonal forces that occur at harmonics of the spin rate, and the broadband forces that arise from random effects. The empirical forcing functions are filtered by a physical model of the wheel structure that includes spin-rate-dependent moments (gyroscopic terms). The resulting hybrid model creates a highly accurate prediction of wheel-induced forces. It accounts for variation in disturbance frequency, as well as the shifts in structural amplification by the whirl modes, as the spin rate changes. This software provides a point-and-click environment for producing accurate models with minimal user effort. Where conventional approaches may take weeks to produce a model of variable quality, RWDMES can create a demonstrably high accuracy model in two hours. The software consists of a graphical user interface (GUI) that enables the user to specify all analysis parameters, to evaluate analysis results and to iteratively refine the model. Underlying algorithms automatically extract disturbance harmonics, initialize and tune harmonic models, and initialize and tune broadband noise models. The component steps are described in the RWDMES <b>user</b> <b>s</b> <b>guide</b> and include: converting time domain data to waterfall PSDs (power spectral densities); converting PSDs to order analysis data; extracting harmonics; initializing and simultaneously tuning a harmonic model and a wheel structural model; initializing and tuning a broadband model; and verifying the harmonic/broadband/structural model against the measurement data. Functional operation is through a MATLAB GUI that loads test data, performs the various analyses, plots evaluation data for assessment and refinement of analysis parameters, and exports the data to documentation or downstream analysis code. The harmonic models are defined as specified functions of frequency, typically speed-squared. The reaction wheel structural model is realized as mass, damping, and stiffness matrices (typically from a finite element analysis package) {{with the addition of a}} gyroscopic forcing matrix. The broadband noise model is realized as a set of speed-dependent filters. The tuning of the combined model is performed using nonlinear least squares techniques. RWDMES is implemented as a MATLAB toolbox comprising the Fit Manager for performing the model extraction, Data Manager for managing input data and output models, the Gyro Manager for modifying wheel structural models, and the Harmonic Editor for evaluating and tuning harmonic models. This software was validated using data from Goodrich E wheels, and from GSFC Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) wheels. The validation testing proved that RWDMES has the capability to extract accurate disturbance models from flight reaction wheels with minimal user effort...|$|E

40|$|Prediction Algorithms for the Attitude Estimator The {{attitude}} estimator is {{an extended}} Kalman filter, a recursive algorithm to treat noisy inputs to a dynamical system. The filter is optimal {{to compute the}} system s states. One of the steps involves a model representation of the system. In {{the case of the}} attitude dynamics of a satellite that has sun sensors and a magnetometer, this requires prior knowledge of the position of the sun with respect to the satellite and the magnetic flux density vector of the earth s magnetic field at the satellite location. These problems have all been solved already, good software is available online and no new discovery was made here. The innovation is the integration of these software parts, the harmonization of their interfaces and the legitimate simplifications done to prevent too high complexity on restricted hardware. The digital attachment contains ready to use software and test procedures for the further development of the attitude determination and control system. The thesis describes the theory and serves as <b>user</b> <b>s</b> <b>guide</b> for the five parts 1. Time Conversions: The algorithms depend on time. Different time systems (e. g. universal time, terrestrial time) and time representations (e. g. time and date, day of the year) are advantageous dependent on the application. The user deals only with the time and date representation of universal time. 2. Frame Transformations: As with the time, some reference frames are better suited than other for particular tasks. The user only sees vectors expressed in the Earth-Centered Inertial Frame, but internally a lot of transformations occur. 3. Sun Vector Predictor: A low accuracy Astronomical Almanac sun vector algorithm is used. The satellite is so close to the earth that there is no difference in the vector from the earth s centre to the sun compared to the vector from the satellite to the sun. 4. Orbit Position and Velocity Prediction: This is also called orbit propagation. The Simplified General Perturbations 4 propagator is used. It needs the Two-Line Element Set for NUTS for the orbit description and returns the satellite position needed for the next predictor. The velocity can be useful for the attitude controller. 5. Geomagnetic Field Prediction: There are currently two equally precise models implemented, The World Magnetic Model 2015 and The 12 th Generation International Geomagnetic Reference Field. Of course only one is necessary for the satellite. Hardware tests suggest to use the World Magnetic Model because it runs faster. Robust Spacecraft Attitude Stabilization using Magnetorquers Attitude control of a spacecraft with magnetic coils as only actuators does not suffice to attain and maintain any desired attitude. However if the aim is to stabilize the spacecraft such that one axis points to the earth, there are formal proofs that magnetorquers provide enough control action for the stabilization under certain assumptions. This chapter extends two such proofs. The need of knowledge of the spacecraft inertia is relaxed and no special property on the earth s magnetic field is required. The first controller is a nonlinear D controller. A strict Lyapunov function is found with help of Matrosov s theorem. If the unknown inertia is viewed as the (small) perturbation of an estimate, the controller still stabilizes the attitude globally, uniformly and asymptotically. The second controller is designed with the sliding mode control method. If the torque that the unknown inertia raises, is viewed as part of a (small) disturbance, the controller still stabilizes the attitude globally, uniformly and asymptotically...|$|E

40|$|The conical-domain {{model is}} a {{computational}} model, now undergoing development, for estimating ionospheric delays of Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Relative to the standard ionospheric delay model described below, the conical-domain model offers improved accuracy. In the absence of selective availability, the ionosphere is the largest source of error for single-frequency users of GPS. Because ionospheric signal delays contribute to errors in GPS position and time measurements, satellite-based augmentation systems (SBASs) {{have been designed to}} estimate these delays and broadcast corrections. Several national and international SBASs are currently in various stages of development to enhance the integrity and accuracy of GPS measurements for airline navigation. In the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) of the United States, slant ionospheric delay errors and confidence bounds are derived from estimates of vertical ionospheric delay modeled on a grid at regularly spaced intervals of latitude and longitude. The estimate of vertical delay at each ionospheric grid point (IGP) is calculated from a planar fit of neighboring slant delay measurements, projected to vertical using a standard, thin-shell model of the ionosphere. Interpolation on the WAAS grid enables estimation of the vertical delay at the ionospheric pierce point (IPP) corresponding to any arbitrary measurement of a user. (The IPP of a given <b>user</b> <b>s</b> measurement is the point where the GPS signal ray path intersects a reference ionospheric height.) The product of the interpolated value and the <b>user</b> <b>s</b> thin-shell obliquity factor provides an estimate of the <b>user</b> <b>s</b> ionospheric slant delay. Two types of error that restrict the accuracy of the thin-shell model are absent in the conical domain model: (1) error due to the implicit assumption that the electron density is independent of the azimuthal angle at the IPP and (2) error arising from the slant-to-vertical conversion. At low latitudes or at mid-latitudes under disturbed conditions, the accuracy of SBAS systems based upon the thin-shell model suffers due to the presence of complex ionospheric structure, high delay values, and large electron density gradients. Interpolation on the vertical delay grid serves as an additional source of delay error. The conical-domain model permits direct computation of the <b>user</b> <b>s</b> slant delay estimate without the intervening use of a vertical delay grid. The key is to restrict each fit of GPS measurements to a spatial domain encompassing signals from only one satellite. The conical domain model is so named because each fit involves a group of GPS receivers that all receive signals from the same GPS satellite (see figure); the receiver and satellite positions define a cone, the satellite position being the vertex. A user within a given cone evaluates the delay to the satellite directly, using (1) the IPP coordinates of the line of sight to the satellite and (2) broadcast fit parameters associated with the cone. The conical-domain model partly resembles the thin-shell model in that both models reduce an inherently four-dimensional problem to two dimensions. However, unlike the thin-shell model, the conical domain model does not involve any potentially erroneous simplifying assumptions about the structure of the ionosphere. In the conical domain model, the initially four-dimensional problem becomes truly two-dimensional in the sense that once a satellite location has been specified, any signal path emanating from a satellite can be identified by only two coordinates; for example, the IPP coordinates. As a consequence, a <b>user</b> <b>s</b> slant-delay estimate converges to the correct value in the limit that the receivers converge to the <b>user</b> <b>s</b> location (or, equivalently, in the limit that the measurement IPPs converge to the <b>user</b> <b>s</b> IPP) ...|$|R
