40|$|Coxsackievirus B (CVB) {{infection}} {{is a common}} cause of acute viral myocarditis. The clinical presentation of myocarditis caused by this enterovirus is highly variable, ranging from mildly symptoms to complete hemodynamic collapse. These variations in initial symptoms and in the immediate and long term outcomes of this disease have impeded development of effective treatment strategies. Nine cynomolgus monkeys were inoculated with myocarditic strains of CVB. Virological studies performed up to 28 days post-inoculation demonstrated the development of neutralizing antibody in all animals, {{and the presence of}} CVB in plasma. High dose intravenous inoculation (n = 2) resulted in severe disseminated disease, while low dose intravenous (n = 6) or oral infection (1 animal) resulted in clinically <b>unapparent</b> <b>infection.</b> Transient, minor, echocardiographic abnormalities were noted in several animals, but no animals displayed signs of significant acute cardiac failure. Although viremia rapidly resolved, signs of myocardial inflammation and injury were observed in all animals at the time of necropsy, and CVB was detected in postmortem myocardial specimens up to 28 days PI. This non-human primate system replicates many features of illness in acute coxsackievirus myocarditis and demonstrates that myocardia...|$|E

40|$|Canine {{babesiosis}} is a common, highly virulent {{disease in}} Southern Africa with even pups and juveniles being severely affected. This contrasts with bovine babesiosis, for example, where host, parasite and vector co-evolved and young animals develop immunity after infection without showing clinical signs. Babesia rossi, the main causative organism of canine babesiosis in sub-Saharan Africa, was first described from a side-striped jackal (Canis adustus) in Kenya. Although data are meagre, {{there is evidence}} that indigenous African canids, such as jackals and wild dogs (Lycaon pictus), can harbour the parasite without showing untoward effects. Dogs are not indigenous to Africa. The vast majority of dogs presented at veterinary facilities in South Africa represent recently introduced European, Asian or American breeds. The contention is that B. rossi is a new challenge to which these dogs have not adapted. With intensive treatment of clinical cases, natural selection is effectively negated and the status quo will probably be maintained indefinitely. It is postulated that Babesia vogeli, which frequently results in <b>unapparent</b> <b>infections</b> or mild manifestations in dogs, represents or is closely related to the ancestral form of the canine parasite, possibly originating from wolves (Canis lupus) ...|$|R

We have evaluated the tropism of TATV in vivo in small animals. We found that TATV does not infect Graphiurus kelleni, a species of African dormouse, but does induce seroconversion in the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) and in mice; however, in wild-type mice and gerbils, the virus produces an <b>unapparent</b> <b>infection.</b> Following intranasal and footpad inoculations with 1 × 106 plaque forming units (PFU) of TATV, immunocompromised stat 1 −/− mice showed signs of disease but did not die; however, SCID mice were susceptible to intranasal and footpad infections with 100 % mortality observed by Day 35 and Day 54, respectively. We show that death {{is unlikely to be}} a result of the virus mutating to have increased virulence and that SCID mice are capable of transmitting TATV to C 57 BL/ 6 and C 57 BL/ 6 stat 1 −/− animals; however, transmission did not occur from TATV inoculated wild-type or stat 1 −/− mice.

40|$|Microsporidia are a {{group of}} obligate {{intracellular}} parasitic fungi that have risen {{over the past two}} decades from obscure organisms to well recognized human pathogens. Out of 14 species reported to infect humans and causing more severe symptoms in immunocompromised individuals, microsporidia of the species Encephalitozoon and Enterocytozoon bieneusi are the most frequent causes of life-threatening chronic diarrhea and systemic disease in HIV patients and acute, self-limited diarrhea in immunocompetent persons. Although the diagnosis and clinical management of microsporidiosis cases have improved significantly recently, the epidemiology of human microsporidiosis is still unclear. To identify the occurrence of latent microsporidia infections in apparently healthy people, the authors tested sera, urine and stool originating from fifteen persons within a three month period. They found specific antibodies against microsporidia in sera originating from fourteen individuals, and using molecular tools, they detected microsporidial infection intermittently in all tested people. The presence of detectable amounts of microsporidial spores demonstrated that exposure to microsporidia is more common than previously believed and microsporidiosis is not linked to any clinical manifestations in healthy people. This finding should make the clinician more aware of the risk of this <b>unapparent</b> <b>infection,</b> its potential reactivation after immunosupression and consequences leading to life-threatening disease...|$|E
40|$|Classical {{swine fever}} virus (CSFV) causes {{a broad range of}} disease in pigs, from acute {{symptoms}} including high fever and hemorrhages, to chronic disease or <b>unapparent</b> <b>infection,</b> depending on the virus strain. CSFV belongs to the genus Pestivirus of the family Flaviviridae. It carries a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome. An internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) in the 5 ' untranslated region (UTR) drives the translation of a single open reading frame encoding a 3898 amino acid long polypeptide chain. The open reading frame is followed by a 3 ' UTR comprising four highly structured stem-loops. In the present study, a synthetic RNA composed of the 5 ' and 3 ' UTRs of the CSFV genome devoid of any viral coding sequence and separated by a luciferase gene cassette (designated 5 'UTR-Luc- 3 'UTR) triggered apoptotic cell death as early as 4 h post-transfection. The apoptosis was measured by DNA laddering analysis, TUNEL assay, annexin-V binding determined by flow cytometry, and by analysis of caspase activation. Contrasting with this, only trace DNA laddering was observed in cells transfected with the individual 5 ' or 3 ' UTR RNA; even when the 5 ' UTR and 3 ' UTR were co-transfected as separate RNA molecules, DNA laddering did not reach the level induced by the chimeric 5 'UTR-Luc- 3 'UTR RNA. Interestingly, RNA composed of the 5 'UTR and of stem-loop I of the 3 'UTR triggered much stronger apoptosis than the 5 ' or 3 'UTR alone. These results indicate that the 5 ' and 3 ' UTRs act together in cis induce apoptosis. We furthered obtained evidence that the UTR-mediated apoptosis required double-stranded RNA and involved translation shutoff possibly through activation of PKR...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} novel human {{respiratory}} disease agents {{have been described}} in South East Asia and Australia. The causative pathogens were classified as pteropine orthoreoviruses with strong phylogenetic relationship to orthoreoviruses of flying foxes inhabiting these regions. Subsequently, a zoonotic bat-to-human transmission has been assumed. We report the isolation of three novel mammalian orthoreoviruses (MRVs) from European bats, comprising bat-borne orthoreovirus outside of South East Asia and Australia and moreover detected in insectivorous bats (Microchiroptera). MRVs are well known to infect {{a broad range of}} mammals including man. Although they are associated with rather mild and clinically <b>unapparent</b> <b>infections</b> in their hosts, there is growing evidence of their ability to also induce more severe illness in dogs and man. In this study, eight out of 120 vespertilionid bats proved to be infected with one out of three novel MRV isolates, with a distinct organ tropism for the intestine. One isolate was analyzed by 454 genome sequencing. The obtained strain T 3 /Bat/ Germany/ 342 / 08 had closest phylogenetic relationship to MRV strain T 3 D/ 04, isolated from a dog.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) <b>infections</b> (<b>unapparent</b> acute <b>infections</b> and persistent infections) on the overall health and performance of feedlot cattle. Calves from 25 pens (7132 calves) were enrolled in the study. Overall and infectious disease mortality rates were significantly higher (P < 0. 05) in pens categorized at arrival as positive for type I BVDV and lower in pens that were positive for type II BVDV than in negative pens. Mortality attributed to BVDV infection or enteritis was significantly more common (P < 0. 05) in the pens containing persistently infected (PI) calves than in pens not containing PI calves (non-PI pens). There were no statistically detectable (P ≥ 0. 05) differences in morbidity, overall mortality, average daily gain, or the dry matter intake to gain ratio between PI and non-PI pens. Although type-I BVDV infections in feedlots appear to contribute to higher mortality rates, the presence of PI calves alone does not appear to have a strong impact on pen-level animal health and feedlot performance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Over 100 genotypes {{of human}} papillomaviruses (HPVs) have been {{identified}} as being responsible for <b>unapparent</b> <b>infections</b> or for lesions ranging from benign skin or genital warts to cancer. The pathogenesis of HPV results from complex relationships between viral and host factors, driven in particular by the interplay between the host proteome and the early viral proteins. The E 2 protein regulates the transcription, the replication as well as the mitotic segregation of the viral genome through the recruitment of host cell factors to the HPV regulatory region. It is thereby a pivotal factor for the productive viral life cycle and for viral persistence, a major risk factor for cancer development. In addition, the E 2 proteins have been shown to engage numerous interactions through which they play important roles in modulating the host cell. Such E 2 activities are probably contributing to create cell conditions appropriate for the successive stages of the viral life cycle, and some of these activities have been demonstrated only for the oncogenic high-risk HPV. The recent mapping of E 2 -host protein-protein interactions with 12 genotypes representative of HPV diversity has shed some light on the large complexity of the host cell hijacking and on its diversity according to viral genotypes. This article reviews the functions of E 2 as they emerge from the E 2 /host proteome interplay, taking into account the large-scale comparative interactomic study...|$|R
40|$|This deposit is {{composed}} {{by the main}} article plus the supplementary materials of the publication. Nitric oxide (NO) is a proposed component of malaria pathogenesis, and the inducible nitric oxide synthase gene (NOS 2) has been associated to malaria susceptibility. We analyzed the role of NOS 2 polymorphisms on NO bioavailability and on susceptibility to infection, Plasmodium carrier status and clinical malaria. Two distinct West African sample collections were studied: a population-based collection of 1, 168 apparently healthy individuals from the Príncipe Island and a hospital-based cohort of 269 Angolan children. We found that two NOS 2 promoter single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) alleles associated to low NO plasma levels in noninfected individuals were also associated to reduced risk of pre-erythrocytic infection as measured anti-CSP antibody levels (6. 25 E- 04 < P < 7. 57 E- 04). In contrast, three SNP alleles within the NOS 2 cistronic region conferring increased NO plasma levels in asymptomatic carriers were strongly associated to risk of parasite carriage (8. 00 E- 05 < P < 7. 90 E- 04). Notwithstanding, three SNP alleles in this region protected from cerebral malaria (7. 90 E- 4 < P < 4. 33 E- 02). Cohesively, the results revealed a dual regimen in the genetic control of NO bioavailability afforded by NOS 2 depending on the infection status. NOS 2 promoter variants operate in noninfected individuals to decrease both NO bioavailability and susceptibility to pre-erythrocytic infection. Conversely, NOS 2 cistronic variants (namely, rs 6505469) operate in infected individuals to increase NO bioavailability and confer increased susceptibility to <b>unapparent</b> <b>infection</b> but protect from cerebral malaria. These findings corroborate the hypothesis that NO anti-inflammatory properties impact on different steps of malaria pathogenesis, explicitly by favoring infection susceptibility and deterring severe malaria syndromes.

Destes relatos considerados como casos não duvidosos de toxoplasmose humana, 10 representam uma doença congênita (Torres e Paige, Wolf & Cowen) ocorrendo em crianças recemnascidas ou de poucos meses de vida. Como nas vezes em que foi possivel examinar as mães dessas crianças tratava-se de mulheres com aspecto sadio, concluiu-se que a moléstia, embora sumamente grave e mortal, pode apresentar uma forma inaparente. Em dois casos, provas de soro proteção demonstraram essa infecção materna inaparente, pelo encontro de anticorpos neutralizantes para Toxoplasma (Paige, Cowen & Wolf). Nada obstante não ter sido feito um estudo microscópico detalhado em todos os casos, a doença caracteriza-se por uma meningoence falomielite granulomatosa (Wolf & Cowen), associada frequentemente à miocardite e corioretinite. Os sintomas apresentados pelos pacientes, foram: febre, convulsões, distúrbios respiratórios, hidrocefalia, cianose, vômitos, labidade de temperatura, etc., sendo sinal diagnóstico de máxima importância, o encontro de focos de calcificação {{cerebral}} profunda e corioretinite em recem nascido (Dyke, Wolf, Cowen, Paige & Caffey). Em dois casos de toxoplasmose verificados em pacientes de seis e oito anos respectivamente, foi encontrada uma encefalite clinicamente atípica, sendo que um deles sarou (Sabin). Os três casos restantes foram descritos em adultos; num deles as lesões não eram típicas (havia concomitância de infecção por Bartonella bacilliformis) e nos outros dois, a doença assumiu uma "forma exantemática", simulando as febres maculosas (Pinkerton & Henderson), sendo o achado mais importante microscopicamente, uma pneumonia intersticial. Alem da semelhança clínica, tambem os focos de encefalite encontrados nessa "forma exantemática" da toxoplasmose, são semelhantes aos descritos nas [...] . Since Castellani's initial work in 1914, investigators {{of various}} countries {{have pointed out}} the occurrence of human toxoplasmosis, a fact which, still not long ago, {{was a matter of}} controversy. As resulting from the works of Torres, Levanditi & coworkers, Wolf, Cowen & Paige, Pinkerton & Henderson and Sabin, the problem of parasitism in man by Toxoplasma has to be faced taking into consideration that there have been described doubtful and undoubtful cases. Doubtful are the cases reported by Castellani (Ceylon, 1914); Fedorovitch (The Black Sea, 1916); Chalmers & Kamar (Sudan, 1920); and Bland (London, 1930 - 31). Undoubtful are those reported by Janku (Praga, 1923); Torres (Rio de Janeiro, 1927); Wolf & Cowen (New York, 1937); Richter (Chicago, 1936 : diagnosed by Wolf & Cowen in 1938); Wolf, Cowen & Paige (New York, 1939); Hertig (Massachusetts, 1935 : diagnosed by Pinkerton & Weinman in 1940); Pinkerton & Weinman (Lima, Peru, 1940); Sabin (2 cases, Cincinnati, 1941); Pinkerton & Henderson (2 cases, Saint Louis, 1941); Paige, Cowen & Wolf (3 cases, New York, 1942); and De Lange (Amsterdam, 1929 : diagnosed by Paige, Cowen & Wolf in 1942). Of these reports considered as undoubtful cases of human toxoplasmosis, 10 represent congenital disease (Torres and Paige, Wolf & Cowen), having occurred in either new born or a-few-month-old children. As in the cases, in which it was possible to examine the mothers of those children, these women were of a healthy appearance, the conclusion was drawn that the disease, although extremely severe and fatal, can present an unapparent form. In 2 cases, serum protection tests proved such an <b>unapparent</b> <b>infection</b> of the mothers, in whom neutralizing antibodies against Toxoplasma were met with (Paige, Cowen & Wolf). Although no detailed microscopical study has been made in all cases, the disease is characterized by granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis (Wolf & Cowen), often associated with myocarditis and chorioretinitis. The symptoms presented by the patients were: fever, convulsions, respiratory disturbances, hydrocephalus, cyanosis, vomiting, temperature lability, etc., the diagnostic sign of the greatest importance being the presence of foci of profound cerebral calcification and chorioretinitis in new born (Wolf, Cowen & Paige). In 2 cases of toxoplasmosis verified in one 6 and the other 8 years old, patients, an encephalitis, clinically atypical, was met with, one of them having recovered his health (Sabin). The remaining three cases were described in adults; in one of them the changes were not typical (these was a concomittant infection by Bartonella bacilliformis) and in the two others the disease assumed an "exanthematous form", simulating a macular fever (Pinkerton & Henderson), the most important microscopical evidence being an interstitial pneumonia. Apart from the clinical similarity, also the encephalitis foci met with in this "exanthematous form" of toxoplasmosis resemble those described in "macular fevers"...|$|E

40|$|Avian mycoplasmas {{occur in}} a variety of bird species. The most {{important}} mycoplasmas for chickens and turkeys are Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), M. synoviae (MS), and M. meleagridis. Besides, M. iowe (MI) is an emerging pathogen in turkeys, but of little concern for chickens. Mycoplasmas are bacteria that lack cell wall and belong to the class Mollicutes. Although they have been considered extracellular agents, scientists admit nowadays that some of them are obligatory intracellular microorganisms, whereas all other mycoplasmas are considered facultative intracellular organisms. Their pathogenic mechanism for disease include adherence to host target cells, mediation of apoptosis, innocent bystander damage to host cell due to intimate membrane contact, molecular (antigen) mimicry that may lead to tolerance, and mitotic effect for B and/or T lymphocytes, which could lead to suppressed T-cell function and/or production of cytotoxic T cell, besides mycoplasma by-products, such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radicals. Moreover, mycoplasma ability to stimulate macrophages, monocytes, T-helper cells and NK cells, results in the production of substances, such as tumor necrosing factor (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL- 1, 2, 6) and interferon (a, b, g). The major clinical signs seen in avian mycoplasmosis are coughing, sneezing, snicks, respiratory rales, ocular and nasal discharge, decreased feed intake and egg production, increased mortality, poor hatchability, and, primarily in turkeys, swelling of the infraorbital sinus(es). Nevertheless, chronic and <b>unapparent</b> <b>infections</b> are most common and more threatening. Mycoplasmas are transmitted horizontally, from bird to bird, and vertically, from dam to offspring through the eggs. Losses attributed to mycoplasmosis, mainly MG and MS infections, result from decreased egg production and egg quality, poor hatchability (high rate of embryonic mortality and culling of day-old birds), poor feed efficiency, increase in mortality and carcass condemnations, besides medication costs. Mycoplasmas are diagnosed by serologic tests, culture and PCR and are sensitive to antimicrobials whose action sites are other than the bacterial cell wall, such as tetracyclines, macrolides, quinolones and tiamulin. However, mycoplasma control is more efficiently achieved by acquisition of birds free of MG, MS, MM and/or MI, vaccination of layers, and monitoring of breeder flocks, followed by elimination of the infected flocks that are detected...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Strongyloidiasis is {{commonly}} a clinically <b>unapparent,</b> chronic <b>infection,</b> but immuno suppressed subjects can develop fatal disease. We {{carried out a}} review of literature on hyperinfection syndrome (HS) and disseminated strongyloidiasis (DS), in order to describe the most challenging aspects of severe strongyloidiasis. METHODS: We conducted a structured search using PubMed to collect case reports and short case series on HS/DS published from 1991 to 2011. We restricted search to papers in English, Spanish, Italian and French. Case reports were classified as HS/DS according to given definitions. RESULTS: Records screened were 821, and 311 were excluded through titles and abstract evaluation. Of 510 full-text articles assessed for eligibility, 213 were included in qualitative analysis. As {{some of them were}} short case series, eventually the number of cases analyzed was 244. Steroids represented the main trigger predisposing to HS and DS (67 % cases) : they were mostly administered to treat underlying conditions (e. g. lymphomas, rheumatic diseases). However, sometimes steroids were empirically prescribed to treat signs and symptoms caused by unsuspected/unrecognized strongyloidiasis. Diagnosis was obtained by microscopy examination in 100 % cases, while serology was done in a few cases (6. 5 %). Only in 3 / 29 cases of solid organ/bone marrow transplantation there is mention of pre-transplant serological screening. Therapeutic regimens were different in terms of drugs selection and combination, administration route and duration. Similar fatality rate was observed between patients with DS (68. 5 %) and HS (60 %). CONCLUSIONS: Proper screening (which must include serology) is mandatory in high - risk patients, for instance candidates to immunosuppressive medications, currently or previously living in endemic countries. In some cases, presumptive treatment might be justified. Ivermectin is the gold standard for treatment, although the optimal dosage is not clearly defined in case of HS/DS...|$|R
40|$|Mourilyan virus (MoV) is a newly {{identified}} virus of Penaeus monodon prawns that is genetically {{related to}} the Uukuniemi virus and other phleboviruses of the Bunyaviridae. This paper describes an RT-nested PCR test that can reliably detect between 2 and 6 copies of a synthetic MoV RNA. Total RNA isolated from the lymphoid organ, gills and haemocytes of P. monodon with moderate infections gave comparable amplicon yields in the RT-PCR step of the test. However, in prawns with extremely low-level infections, haemocytes and gill tissue proved slightly more reliable in detecting MoV RNA following nested PCR. The distribution of MoV in tissues of healthy and moribund P. monodon was examined by in situ hybridisation (ISH) using a digoxigenin-labelled DNA probe to a similar to 0. 8 kb M RNA segment cDNA insert in clone pMoV 4. 1. The DNA probe targeted a region in the MoV M RNA segment containing a coding sequence with homology to the C-terminus of the G 2 glycoprotein of phleboviruses. In healthy prawns harbouring an <b>unapparent</b> MoV <b>infection,</b> ISH signal primarily occurred in the lymphoid organ, where it was more prominent in hypertrophied cells of 2 ̆ 7 spheroids 2 ̆ 7 than within cells of normal tubules. ISH signal was also sometimes detected in cells of cuticular epithelium, segmental nerve ganglion and the antermal and tegmental glands. MoV was distributed widely throughout these and other cephalothoracic tissues of mesodermal and ectodermal origin in moribund P. monodon following experimental infection or collected from farm pond edges during disease episodes. Transmission electron microscopy of gill of moribund, captive-reared P. monodon identified spherical (similar to 85 nm diameter) to ovoid MoV particles (similar to 85 x 100 nm) in and around highly necrotic cells in which the nucleus and other organelles had disintegrated.

40|$|International audienceABSTRACT: The {{detection}} of hepatitis C virus (HCV) -specific T cell responses in HCV-uninfected, presumably unexposed, subjects {{could be due}} to an underestimation of the frequency of spontaneously resolving infections, as most acute HCV infections are clinically silent. To address this hypothesis, HCV-specific cellular immune responses were characterized, in individuals negative for an HCV PCR assay and humoral response, with (n= 32) or without (n= 33) risk of exposure to HCV. Uninfected volunteers (n= 20) with a chronically HCV-infected partner were included as positive controls for potential exposure to HCV and HCV infection, respectively. HCV-specific T cell responses in freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells were studied ex vivo by ELISPOT and CFSE-based proliferation assays using panels of HCV Core and NS 3 -derived peptides. A pool of unrelated peptides was used as a negative control, and a peptide mix of human cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Bar virus and Influenza virus as a positive control. Overall, 20 % of presumably HCV-uninfected subject tested had detectable T-cell responses to the virus, a rate much higher than previous estimates of HCV prevalence in developed countries. This result would be consistent with <b>unapparent</b> primary HCV <b>infections</b> that either cleared spontaneously or remained undetected by conventional serological assays...|$|R
40|$|Sexual {{partners}} of patients {{infected with the}} hepatitis C virus (HCV) often have detectable HCV-specific T-cell responses {{in the absence of}} seroconversion, suggesting <b>unapparent,</b> spontaneously resolving <b>infection.</b> To determine whether differences in the evolutionary potential of bottlenecked inoculum may explain the low rate of HCV persistence after sexual exposure, we have investigated changes in the entire HCV nonstructural 3 (NS 3) gene over time in a chronic carrier and compared his viral quasispecies with that of the acute-phase isolate of his sexual partner, who developed acute resolving hepatitis C. The overall rate of accumulation of mutations, estimated by regression analysis of six consecutive consensus NS 3 sequences over 8 years, was 1. 5 × 10 − 3 mutations per site per year, with small intersample fluctuations related to changes in environmental conditions. Comparison of quasispecies parameters in one isolate of the chronic carrier with those of the acute-phase isolate of the infected partner revealed a higher heterogeneity and lower proportion of nonsynonymous mutations in the former. All NS 3 sequences from the acute-phase isolate clustered with a single sequence from the chronic isolate, despite complete HLA mismatch between the patients, suggesting bottlenecking during transmission. The low risk of viral persistence after sexual exposure to HCV {{may be related to the}} selection of a limited number of viral particles carrying a particular combination of mutations which may further limit the potential of a relatively homogeneous quasispecies to rapidly diversify and overcome the immune response of the exposed host...|$|R

The crucial role of genital oncogenic HPV in cervical carcinoma development is now well established. In contrast, the role of cutaneous HPV in skin cancer development remains a matter of debate.

The fact that a few oncogenic genotypes cause cancers in patients suffering from epidermodysplasia verruciformis is {{in sharp contrast to}} the <b>unapparent</b> course of <b>infection</b> in the general population.

A central role in the function of this HPV-specific barrier is played by a complex of the zinc-transporting proteins EVER 1, EVER 2, and ZnT- 1, which maintain cellular zinc homeostasis. Apparently, the deregulation of the cellular zinc balance emerges as an important step in the life cycles not only of cutaneous but also of genital HPVs, although the latter viruses have developed a mechanism by which they can break the barrier and impose a zinc imbalance. Herein, we present a previously unpublished list of the cellular partners of EVER proteins, which points to future directions concerning investigations of the mechanisms of action of the EVER/ZnT- 1 complex. We also present a general overview of the pathogenesis of HPV infections, taking into account the latest discoveries regarding the role of cellular zinc homeostasis in the HPV life cycle. We propose a potential model for the mechanism of function of the anti-HPV barrier...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{evidence}} is presented for drastic changes in phosphomonoesterase activities of tissue cultures, {{brought about by}} infection with poliomyelitis viruses. Acid phosphatase activity went through a maximum before decreasing almost to zero level. Alkaline phosphatase activity diminished progressively to zero, then with disruption of the cells attamed normal levels. Various aspects of the kinetics were investigated and illustrated. The initial increase of acid phosphatase, {{in contrast with the}} alkaline, may mean that the reactions catalyzed by this enzyme continue during the early phase. This period is the time of intense virus production and therefore it was supposed that this enzyme may play some role in virus synthesis. It was assumed that the virus acts as a particle of molecular size and becomes associated with the enzyme complex physicochemically or chemically. This association ends with the disintegration of the host cells. During the cell-virus interaction a toxin may develop which is a strong and general enzyme inhibitor. Various enzyme systems differ in sensitivity toward these virus effects; for instance, acid phosphatase is irreversibly inhibited or may be destroyed. The visible CPE of virus is preceded by a drastic reduction of enzyme activities in whole TC and in its various fractions, which may suggest causal relationship in the mechanism of cell destruction. In arrested or latent infection these processes are operative, but on a smaller scale. The drop in activities cannot be explained by the reduction of tissue mass, which is the consequence, rather than the cause, of enzyme changes. Besides the theoretical significance of these observations the following practical points can be summarized: 1. Changes in phosphatase activities are most strikingly demonstrated in whole tissue cultures inoculated with poliomyelitis virus. 2. There is causal relationship among infection, enzyme changes, and transformation of cell physiology. 3. The biochemical approach provides a quantitative measure of the extent of cell damage, before visible CPE is detectible. 4. <b>Unapparent</b> and active <b>infections</b> with poliomyelitis virus could be differentiated from normal controls by this method. 5. By various manipulations (freezing, long incubation) the difference between normal and infected TC can be enhanced. Suitable technical methods were proposed for various types of investigations...|$|R
