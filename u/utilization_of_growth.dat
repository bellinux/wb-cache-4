The definition of the optimal stand structure was based on the analysis of causal relationships between crown structure and tree and stand increment. It was concluded that the optimal number of trees on the sample plots should be considerably lower compared to the actual number of trees.

40|$|Many catabolic {{pathways}} {{begin with}} an ATP-requiring activation step, after which further metabolism yields a surplus of ATP. Such a 'turbo' principle is useful but also contains an inherent risk. This is illustrated by a detailed kinetic analysis of a paradoxical Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant; the mutant fails to grow on glucose because of overactive initial enzymes of glycolysis, but is defective only in an enzyme (trehalose 6 -phosphates synthase) {{that appears to have}} little relevance to glycolysis. The ubiquity of pathways that possess an initial activation step, suggests that there might be many more genes that, when deleted, cause rather paradoxical regulation phenotypes (i. e. growth defects caused by enhanced <b>utilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> substrate) ...|$|E

The kinetics of disappearance of individual PAHs was consistent with differences in aqueous solubility. During the incubation, a number of acid metabolites indicative of distinctive reactions carried out by high-molecular-weight PAH-degrading mycobacteria accumulated in the medium. Most of these metabolites were dicarboxylic aromatic acids formed {{as a result of}} the <b>utilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> substrates (phenanthrene, pyrene, or fluoranthene) by multibranched pathways including meta- and ortho-ring-cleavage reactions: phthalic acid, naphthalene- 1, 8 -dicarboxylic acid, phenanthrene- 4, 5 -dicarboxylic acid, diphenic acid, Z- 9 -carboxymethylenefluorene- 1 -carboxylic acid, and 6, 6 ′-dihydroxy- 2, 2 ′-biphenyl dicarboxylic acid.

40|$|Invasive {{species have}} become an {{increasingly}} large concern, particularly in already degraded ecosystems, such as sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) -steppe of the Intermountain West. Much of this ecosystem is already infested with large cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) stands and is potentially at risk for future invasions depending on biotic and abiotic conditions. In these ecosystems, the existing vegetation, whether native or non-native, may not effectively utilize the soil moisture resources in the upper portion of the soil, termed the growth pool. If the existing vegetation does not effectively utilize moisture in the growth pool, an open resource is left {{for the establishment of}} other plants, including invasives. Through a combination of soil moisture modeling and observational studies, we identified three potential invasion pathways, particularly by annual plants, into a cheatgrass-dominated system, all consistent with the fluctuating resource hypothesis, and all resulting from an available water resource in the growth pool.

In this study, we assessed in-sewer <b>utilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> substrates (primary metabolic processes) and transformation of illicit drug biomarkers (secondary metabolic processes) by suspended biomass. Sixteen drug biomarkers were targeted, including mephedrone, methadone, cocaine, heroin, codeine, and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and their major human metabolites. Batch experiments were performed under aerobic and anaerobic conditions using raw wastewater. Abiotic biomarker transformation and partitioning to suspended solids and reactor wall were separately investigated under both redox conditions. A process model was identified by combining and extending the Wastewater Aerobic/anaerobic Transformations in Sewers (WATS) model and Activated Sludge Model for Xenobiotics (ASM-X). Kinetic and stoichiometric model parameters were estimated using experimental data via the Bayesian optimization method DREAM(ZS). Results suggest that biomarker transformation significantly differs from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, and abiotic conversion is the dominant mechanism for many of the selected substances. Notably, an explicit description of biomass growth during batch experiments was crucial to avoid significant overestimation (up to 385 %) of aerobic biotransformation rate constants.

40|$|Introduction Evaluating yield in {{intercropping}} {{systems is}} based on selecting compatible plants with appropriate characteristics to establish minimum competition and maximum cooperation, {{and the application of}} suitable agricultural practices (crop density and intercropping ratio). The use of plant species with different morphological characteristics in terms of nutrient uptake and <b>utilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> environment, and the least competitive species in ecological and environmental factors in a fixed nest causes possibility of presence of two plants in the same ecological niche and better use of resources (Banik et al, 2006; Mushagalusa et al., 2008).

Appropriate plant {{height is}} one of the most important traits in poinsettia production and is commonly achieved by application of chemical growth retardants. To produce compact poinsettia plants with desirable height and reduce the <b>utilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> retardants, the Arabidopsis SHORT INTERNODE (AtSHI) gene controlled by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter was introduced into poinsettia by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Three independent transgenic lines were produced and stable integration of transgene was verified by PCR and Southern blot analysis. Reduced plant height (21 – 52 %) and internode lengths (31 – 49 %) were obtained in the transgenic lines compared to control plants. This correlates positively with the AtSHI transcript levels, with the highest levels in the most dwarfed transgenic line (TL 1). The indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) content appeared lower (11 – 31 % reduction) in the transgenic lines compared to the wild type (WT) controls, with the lowest level (31 % reduction) in TL 1. Total internode numbers, bract numbers and bract area were significantly reduced in all transgenic lines in comparison with the WT controls. Only TL 1 showed significantly lower plant diameter, total leaf area and total dry weight, whereas none of the AtSHI expressing lines showed altered timing of flower initiation, cyathia abscission or bract necrosis.

Since the approval of bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (BMP- 2) for therapeutic use in humans, the concept of utilizing growth factors for bone regeneration in translational medicine has become even more attractive. Despite many studies published on individual growth factors in various bone models, comparative analysis is largely lacking. The aim of our study was to compare three different proosteogenic factors under identical in vivo conditions. Thus, we tested the bone regeneration capacity of the three different growth factors BMP- 2, fibroblast growth factor- 2 (FGF- 2), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) in a calvarial defect model. We demonstrated that BMP- 2 and VEGFA had similar bone healing capacities, resulting in complete calvarial healing as early as week 3. FGF- 2 also showed a significantly higher bone regeneration capacity; however, the healing rate was lower than with BMP- 2 and VEGFA. Interestingly, these findings were paralleled by an increased angiogenic response upon healing in BMP- 2 – and VEGFA-treated calvarial defects as compared with FGF- 2. Immunohistochemistry for proliferating and osteoprogenitor cells revealed activity at different points after surgery among the groups. In conclusion, we demonstrated an efficient bone regeneration capacity of both BMP- 2 and VEGFA, which was superior to FGF- 2. Moreover, this study highlights the efficient bone regeneration of VEGFA, which was comparable with BMP- 2.

Separating different aspects of SES facilitates the specification of a structural relationship between SES indicators and morbidity. Longitudinal data and the <b>utilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> curve modelling enable an empirical analysis of the direct relationship between changes over time in SES indicators and changes in morbidity. Our empirical analysis is based on panel data (N =  2976) derived from the annual Swedish Survey of Living Conditions. The panel, which consists of respondents that at the first panel wave were between 31 and 47 years old, is followed for 16 years, starting in 1979. Data are gathered at three points of time. A growth curve model is set up using structural equation modelling. The structural relationship and changes over time are simultaneously estimated. It is shown that in relation to health occupational position is crucial, canalising the effects of class of origin and education. More prestigious jobs are related to initially good health and to a less rapid deterioration in health. At the same time initial health affects occupational mobility, confirming a health selection into less prestigious jobs. It is also shown that change of occupation and income are related to change in health. The analysis confirms a strong relationship between SES and morbidity and shows that initial SES affects later changes in morbidity, i. e., a causal relationship exists between SES and morbidity. But, the analysis also demonstrates the existence of selection effects, meaning that initial morbidity causes less favourable changes in SES. It is finally revealed that changes in occupational prestige and income changes co-vary with changes in morbidity. Hence, the analysis provides basic information necessary to make any assumption about causality and selection in relation to SES and health.

The competitive action was not evident at higher concentrations of 2, 4 -D. The effect of TIBA and MH was to increase, apparently additively, inhibition caused by 2, 4 -D and IAA.

40|$|Die Antibiotika der Moenomycin-Gruppe sind die einzigen bekannten Naturstoffe, die den vorletzten Schritt der bakteriellen Zellwandsynthese - die Transglykosylierung - durch direkte Bindung an die Peptidoglykan-Glykosyltransferase (PGT) hemmen. Aufgrund ungünstiger pharmakokinetischer Eigenschaften sind Moenomycine von geringem Nutzen für die Humantherapie. Ein Gemisch von Moenomycinen wird allerdings unter der Bezeichnung Flavophospholipol als Mastförderer in der Nutzviehhaltung eingesetzt. Die Verwendung von Antibiotika in der Humanmedizin und in der Tiermast trägt zur Bildung und Selektion antibiotikaresistenter Krankheitserreger bei. Daher werden fortwährend neue Antibiotika benötigt und die essentielle Funktion der PGT macht sie zu einem attraktiven Target für neue Wirkstoffe. Um der Bildung neuer Resistenzen entgegenzuwirken, ist außerdem seit 2006 der Einsatz von Antibiotika zur Leistungssteigerung EU-weit verboten. In dieser Arbeit ist die Entwicklung eines SPR-Biosensor-Assays (SPR: surface plasmon resonance) zum Nachweis von Moenomycinen und anderen PGT-Inhibitoren und dessen Anwendung für die Analyse von Futtermitteln und für {{qualitative}} Struktur- Wirkungsbeziehungen beschrieben. Der Assay basiert auf der Wechselwirkung zwischen der monofunktionellen PGT MtgA aus Staphylococcus aureus und einem immobilisierten Moenomycin A-Derivat. Der Assay erwies sich als ausreichend empfindlich, um praxisrelevante Konzentrationen an Flavophospholipol in Futtermitteln nachzuweisen. Die Eignung des Assays zur Futtermittelanalytik wurde anhand von drei verschiedenen Futtermittelmatrices untersucht. In zwei der Matrices war eine sichere Unterscheidung zwischen positiven und negativen Proben möglich. Im dritten Futtermittel führten Matrixeffekte zu falsch positiven Ergebnissen in der undotierten Matrix. Falsch negative Ergebnisse wurden nicht beobachtet. Außerdem wurde der Assay dazu verwendet, den Wirkmechanismus von PGT-Inhibitoren zu untersuchen, die das natürliche Substrat (Lipid 1 bzw. Lipid 11) imitieren. Alle Inhibitoren führten zu einer Hemmung der MtgA-Bindung an das immobilisierte Moenomycin A, was auf eine Bindung an die Donorbindungsstelle der PGT zurückzuführen ist. Bei niedrigen Konzentrationen der Lipid 11 -analogen Inhibitoren wurde allerdings eine erhöhte MtgA- Bindung festgestellt. Es ist anzunehmen, dass die Inhibitoren an die Akzeptorbindungsstelle binden, was zu heteroallosterischer Aktivierung der Donorbindungsstelle führt. Basierend auf dieser Hypothese konnten unterschiedliche Einflüsse der Strukturelemente der Inhibitoren auf die Affinität zur Akzeptorbindungsstelle abgeleitet werden: Die Disaccharidstruktur der Lipid 11 -Analoga ist essentiell für die Bindung. Eine Phosphoglyceratgruppe als Bindeglied zwischen Lipidrest und Zuckerrest führt zu einer höheren Affinität, als eine Phosphodiestergruppe. Die Peptidseitenkette führt zu verringerterAffinität. Der hier beschriebene Assay ist ein empfindliches Werkzeug für den Nachweis von Moenomycinen und die Identifizierung von PGT-Inhibitoren. Die vorgestellten Ergebnisse stellen den ersten Hinweis auf eine positive Kooperativität der Donor- und Akzeptorbindungsstelle von PGT dar. Die Erkenntnisse bezüglich der untersuchten Inhibitoren tragen zum Verständnis der PGT-Hemmung bei und könnten sich auf dem Weg zu neuen Antibiotika als nützlich für die Entwicklung neuer pharmakologischer Leitstrukturen für PGT-Inhibitoren erweisen. Moenomycins are {{a family}} of highly active (mainly against gram-positive bacteria) glycophospholipid antibiotics inhibiting the penultimate step in bacterial cell wall synthesis (i. e. transglycosylation). They are the only known natural substances inhibiting transglycosylation by binding directly to the peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase (GT). Because of poor pharmacokinetic properties, they are of limited clinical use. A mixture of moenomycins is, however, used as growth promoter in livestock breeding under the name flavophospholipol (Flavomycin®, Gainpro®, Pharmastim®, Jivet®). Use of antibiotics as growth promoters adds to the generation and selection of antibiotic resistant pathogen strains. Thus, <b>utilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> promoters was banned in the European Union in 2006. The threat of emerging antimicrobial resistance caused by {{the widespread use of}} antibiotics in human therapy and animal husbandry leads to a constant need of new antibiotics. GTs are essential for bacteria, which makes them an attractive target. This work describes the development of a competitive SPR (surface plasmon resonance) biosensor assay and its application for analysis in feedstuffs as well as qualitative structure-activity relationship studies on GT inhibition. The assay is based on the interaction between a moenomycin A derivative tethered to the sensor chip surface and monofunctional glycosyltransferase MtgA from Staphylococcus aureus. It is capable of detecting 1 µg/mL flavophospholipol and 0. 5 µM moenomycin A, respectively. Moenomycin A needed for synthesis of the immobilized derivative was isolated from flavophospholipol (Flavomycin®) in high yields (> 70 %) and purity (> 99 %) by a procedure first described in this work. It comprises reversed phase semi-preparative HPLC under acidic conditions followed by desalting via solid phase extraction (SPE). The practicality of the assay for screening for flavophospholipol in feedstuffs was tested. Three feed samples were each analyzed unspiked and spiked at the lowest and highest reasonable flavophospholipol concentrations (between 1 and 20 mg/kg), respectively. Ground feedstuffs were extracted with methanol under elevated pressure and temperature by accelerated solvent extraction. Further cleanup was performed via solid phase extraction. The assay was capable of distinguishing clearly between positive and negative samples in two feedstuffs. In the third feedstuff, matrix interference lead to high SPR responses resulting in a false positive blank sample. However, false negative results were not observed. Furthermore, the assay was used to investigate the mechanism of action of GT inhibitors mimicking the peptidoglycan monomer lipid II or the lipid II precursor lipid I. All inhibitors resulted in decreased MtgA binding to the sensor chip surface indicating inhibition via the donor site of the enzyme. At low concentrations, however, some lipid II analogous inhibitors caused increased MtgA binding. These findings suggest that these lipid II analogs bind to the acceptor site as well, inducing a heteroallosteric activation of the donor site for moenomycin A. However, at high inhibitor concentrations, competition via the donor site outweighs the enhancement. Assuming that this hypothesis of cooperativity is true, differential effects of the analyzed inhibitors on enhancement of MtgA binding point towards the significance of different structure elements for binding to the acceptor site: The disaccharide in lipid II analogs is essential. Phosphoglycerate instead of phosphate as linker between disaccharide and lipid moiety increases affinity. A peptide side chain however reduces affinity. The assay described in this work is a sensitive tool for the detection of moenomycins and the identification of GT inhibitors. The results presented constitute the first indication of a positive cooperativity between donor and acceptor sites of GTs. The findings regarding the examined inhibitors contribute to the understanding of GT inhibition and might add to the development of new pharmaceutical leads for GT inhibitors...|$|E
50|$|Cicer milkvetch {{exhibits}} rhizomes (sometimes {{referred to}} as creeping roots), or an extended horizontal stem propagated underground, which continuously grow as the plant ages. Thus, the plant becomes increasingly vigorous with time. In regards to proliferation, cicer milkvetch spread by its <b>utilization</b> <b>of</b> rhizomatous <b>growth,</b> {{in addition to its}} reproduction via seeds. Seeds (produced by pods) have a very thick integument (or seed coat) in which require scarification, or mechanical methodology, to proceed towards germination. The hardy aspect of the seed coat acts as a preventative barrier against “microbial invasion.” In addition, the thickness of the seed coat reduces the capacity for water absorption, which in turn allows for the seed to remain dormant {{for a longer period of}} time. Stipules are readily observed and green in color. Leaves are compound and alternate.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} an attempt {{is made to}} answer two questions: 1) What set of factors {{explains}} the recent slowdown of the U. S. aggregate labor productivity, and 2) whether {{the same set of}} forces account for the slowdown <b>of</b> sectoral productivity <b>growth</b> as well. We specify a model which relates measured labor productivity growth to capital/labor ratio, level and rate <b>of</b> change <b>of</b> <b>utilization,</b> stock <b>of</b> R & D, and the rate of disembodied technical change. The model is estimated using sectoral and aggregate data for the period 1949 - 1978. The results of the estimation suggest that the pattern <b>of</b> aggregate productivity <b>growth</b> {{can be explained by the}} <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> capital/labor ratio the gap between potential and actual output growth paths, the change in degree <b>of</b> <b>utilization,</b> the <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> stock of total R & D, and the time trend. In fact, both at the aggregate and sectoral levels, these factors account fairly well, first for the growth and then for the subsequent slowdown of labor productivity in the postwar period. To be sure, in some specific industries, the performance of the model could be improved. However, the overall conclusion reached is that the slowdown in <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> capital formation, the inability of the economy and various sectors to grow at their normal growth rates, and the slowdown in rate of technological change are some of the main reasons for the observed productivity slowdown of the recent years. ...|$|R

Similarities between growth on bacteriological media and within tissue cells have been demonstrated by examining the responses of Mycobacterium paratuberculosis and wood pigeon mycobacteria to mycobactin, iron, CO 2, and glycerol, and to the low pH which characterizes phagocytic vacuoles. The results indicate that success of intracellular infections depends upon the independent <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> microbes and that the phagocytic vacuoles of sheep and mouse macrophages seem to be freely accessible to bacterial growth factors, minerals, and substrates. Because these factors did not modify the appearance, overall metabolism, or surface properties of macrophages, it was concluded that the intracellular <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> microbes is not determined solely by the components, metabolism, or immunological properties of host cells, but is influenced to an important degree by compounds and conditions provided by extracellular environments...|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{system of}} wheat and barley cultivation in Saudi Arabia {{was based on}} the <b>utilization</b> <b>of</b> vegetative <b>growth</b> at 50 - 60 days as forage for live stock then allow the crop to produce grains. This system was suitable for local cultivars to delay flowering to frost free periods and reduce their ability to lodging. However, the introduction and use of improved short cultivars has reduced the value of this system in recent wheat and barley production practices. This study was designed to evaluate the use of barley as a dual-purpose crop. The objectives were to determine the suitable planting date, vegetative stage for forage utilization and the appropriate cultivars for this purpose. Six different cultivars, including the commercial cultivar, Justo and a local cultivar from the Asir Region, were planted in three dates 1 st Nov., 25 th Nov. and 20 th Dec. and three cutting treatments at the age of 50 and 65 days and no cut treatment as a control. The experiment was laid out as in split-split plot design with four replications for two successive seasons 95 / 96, 96 / 97. Results of the two seasons data have shown that the planting date at 1 st Nov. was significantly higher than the other planting dates in forage, grain yield and straw production. Cutting for forage at age of 65 days was superior (5. 17 tons/h) to cutting at the age of 50 days. (2. 1 tons/ h). <b>Utilization</b> <b>of</b> vegetative <b>growth</b> for forage at the age of 65 days has resulted in a reduced grain yield ranging from 12 and 59 % in the first and the third planting dates respectively. Whereas the reduction in straw yield was greater ranging from 35 to 58 % in the first and the third planting dates respectively. Significant variations among cultivars were observed in dry forage and grain yields. The cultivar Justo was the best in grain yield, while the local cultivar was the best in forage yield. The cultivars, Giza 121 and Giza 123, had very good forage and grain yields while the cultivar, Sahrawi produced a good forage yield with excellent recovery after harvest which indicated that these three cultivars could be used as dual purpose cultivars under the conditions of the Central Region of Saudi Arabia...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{and protein}} {{requirements}} of growing fish {{can be quantified}} as {{the sum of the}} amounts of energy and protein retained as growth plus the amounts simultaneously lost from the body. The requirement for dietary gross energy and protein can be calculated using the respective effi- ciencies <b>of</b> <b>utilization.</b> <b>Growth</b> <b>of</b> gilthead seabream as a function of body weight and tempera- ture was predicted by the equation: y = 0. 024 x BW 0. 514 x exp 0. 060 T (where y = daily weight gain in g/fish, BW = body weight in g and T = temperature in °C). The gain was determined in fish ranging 1 - 470 g. The energy content of the fish depended on fish weight and rose from 4. 7 to 11. 0 kJ/g body mass as the fish grew whereas the protein content was constant at 176 mg/g regardless of fish weight. The efficiencies <b>of</b> <b>utilization</b> <b>of</b> digestible energy (DE) and digestible protein (DP) for maintenance and growth were determined by feeding the fish at increasing feed- ing levels from zero to the maximum voluntary feed intake. The daily requirement of DE for main- tenance was dependent on temperature and determined as (16. 6 kJ x exp 0. 055 T) /BW in kg 0. 82. The maintenance requirement for DP was independent of temperature and equaled 0. 62 g/ BW in kg 0. 70. The relationship between DE intake and energy gain was linear, constant at kDEg = 0. 67 and independent of feed intake and temperature.
