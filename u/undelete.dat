5|$|TuneUp Utilities 2003: The {{first version}} {{to have become}} {{available}} in English and French, {{as well as the}} original German language. It consists of 16 individual tools accessible through the Start Center, as well as the Windows start menu. It includes features to clean the hard disks, clean and defragment the Windows Registry, optimize Windows and Internet connection settings and change {{the look and feel of}} Windows. It also provides features targeted at users with an intermediate or advanced level of computer knowledge that enables them to edit the registry, manage running processes, uninstall programs, shred and <b>undelete</b> files, and display system information. In addition to the previously-supported Windows 95 and Windows 98, TuneUp Utilities 2003 also supports Windows 2000, Me and Windows XP.|$|E
25|$|CHKDSK and <b>UNDELETE</b> in MS-DOS 5.0 have a bug {{which can}} corrupt data: If the file {{allocation}} table of a disk uses 256 sectors, running CHKDSK /F can cause data loss and running <b>UNDELETE</b> can cause unpredictable results. This normally affects disks with a capacity of approximately a multiple of 128 MB. This applies to CHKDSK.EXE and UNDELETE.EXE bearing April 9, 1991 datestamp. This bug was fixed in MS-DOS 5.0a.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the Windows 9x series, the Windows NT-derived 32-bit operating systems developed alongside the 9x series (Windows NT, 2000, XP and newer) do not contain MS-DOS {{as part of the}} operating system, but provide a subset of DOS emulation to run DOS applications and provide DOS-like command prompt windows. 64-bit versions of Windows NT line do not provide DOS emulation and cannot run DOS applications natively. Windows XP contains a copy of the Windows ME boot disk, stripped down to bootstrap only. This is accessible only by formatting a floppy as an [...] "MS-DOS startup disk". Files like the driver for the CD-ROM support were deleted from the Windows ME bootdisk and the startup files (AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS) no longer had content. This modified disk was the base for creating the MS-DOS image for Windows XP. Some of the deleted files can be recovered with an <b>undelete</b> tool. With Windows Vista the files on the startup disk are dated 18 April 2005 but are otherwise unchanged, including the string [...] "MS-DOS Version 8 Copyright 1981–1999 Microsoft Corp" [...] inside COMMAND.COM. Starting with Windows 10, the ability to create a DOS startup disk has been removed.|$|E

40|$|The maize {{mitochondrial}} {{superoxide dismutase}} (SOD; EC 1. 15. 1. 1), a nuclear gene product, {{has been previously}} shown to be imported into maize mitochondria. The cDNA for maize mitochondrial SOD was subcloned into a vector containing the T 7 promoter. Deletions {{were made in the}} transit peptide coding region of the cDNA. The <b>undeleted</b> and deleted proteins were synthetically produced by transcription and translation in vitro. <b>Undeleted</b> preSOD- 3 is translocated into isolated maize mitochondria with an efficiency of approximately 30 %. Mature SOD- 3 subunits are recovered from the matrix but not the membranes of subfractionated mitochondria. These subunits are assembled into the tetrameric holoenzyme. The modified SOD- 3 precursors are imported into mitochondria at lower efficiencies than <b>undeleted</b> preSOD- 3. The relative import efficiency appears to be dependent upon the deletion size. To our knowledge such analysis of a plant mitochondrial precursor protein has not been reported previously...|$|R
40|$|The {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 genome (160 kilobases) {{contains}} three origins of DNA synthesis: two copies of oriS located within the repeated sequences flanking the short unique arm (US), and one copy of oriL located within the long unique arm (UL). Precise localization and characterization of oriL have been severely hampered by the inability to clone sequences which contain it (coordinates 0. 398 to 0. 413) in an <b>undeleted</b> form in bacteria. We report herein the successful cloning of sequences between 0. 398 to 0. 413 in an <b>undeleted</b> form, using a yeast cloning vector. Sequence analysis of a 425 -base pair fragment spanning the deletion-prone region has revealed a perfect 144 -base pair palindrome with striking homology to oriS. In a functional assay, the <b>undeleted</b> clone was amplified when functions from {{herpes simplex virus}} type 1 were supplied in trans, whereas clones with deletions of 55 base pairs or more were not amplified...|$|R
50|$|It adds {{functionality}} to TiVo such {{as being}} able to set recordings over the internet and <b>undelete</b> deleted shows. It also allows the addition of custom modules which add more features to TivoWeb.|$|E
50|$|Menu driven DOS with {{enhanced}} features. Sorts disk directory listings and can set display options. File directory can be compressed. Can display deleted {{files and}} <b>undelete</b> them. Some advanced features required a proprietary TOP-DOS format.|$|E
50|$|Condusiv Technologies sells and {{supports}} {{a number of}} software products. Diskeeper, a tool for reducing file fragmentation; V-locity Virtual Machine, a platform disk optimizer for virtual server; <b>Undelete,</b> which offers protection from and recovery of accidentally deleted files.|$|E

5000|$|Recorded 18 October 1974 at Glen Studio. The lyrics for {{the song}} were later re-written and became [...] "Rock Me". [...] "Baby" [...] was first {{released}} on CD on the box set Thank You for the Music {{as part of the}} ABBA <b>Undeleted</b> section.|$|R
50|$|The Mirror, <b>Undelete,</b> and Unformat {{utilities}} were {{licensed by}} Central Point to Microsoft {{for inclusion in}} MS-DOS version 5.0. Central Point Anti-Virus and VDefend were licensed as Microsoft AntiVirus and VSafe, respectively, in MS-DOS versions 6.0 through 6.22.|$|E
50|$|This single {{contains}} {{the opening and}} ending themes for the Baldr Force EXE Resolution OVA. Face of Fact (Resolution Ver.) is the opening theme performed by Kotoko while <b>Undelete</b> is the ending theme which was performed by Mami Kawada.|$|E
50|$|FreeUndelete takes {{advantage}} of the fact that file deletion is just a minor state change in the system file index. It finds the area(s) where the file contents are located on the disk, then re-creates the index entry to <b>undelete</b> the file.|$|E
5000|$|... "Rikky Rock 'N' Roller" [...] was {{recorded}} on 15 September 1974 at Glen Studio, and was first released on CD {{on the box}} set Thank You for the Music {{as part of the}} ABBA <b>Undeleted</b> section. Later released by Jerry Williams on the album Kick Down in 1976.|$|R
5000|$|A demo {{instrumental}} recorded during The Album sessions. Some parts {{surfaced in}} the recording sessions for Chess and resulted in a melody line in the track [...] "Merano". A brief excerpt of this song was released in the box set Thank You for the Music {{as part of the}} ABBA <b>Undeleted</b> section.|$|R
5000|$|... "Here Comes Ruby Jamie" [...] was {{recorded}} on 16 September 1974 at Glen Studio, {{and is one}} of the rare occasions where Benny Andersson sings the lead vocals. The song was first released on CD on the box set [...] "Thank You for the Music" [...] as part of the ABBA <b>Undeleted</b> section.|$|R
50|$|Multi-level undo {{commands}} {{were introduced}} in the 1980s, allowing the users to take back a series of actions, not just the most recent one. AtariWriter, a word-processing application introduced in 1982, featured undo. NewWord, another word-processing program released by NewStar in 1984, had an unerase command. IBM's VisiWord also had an <b>undelete</b> command.|$|E
50|$|Norton UNERASE was an {{important}} component in Norton Utilities version 1.0 in 1982. Microsoft included a similar <b>UNDELETE</b> program in versions 5.0 to 6.22 of MS-DOS, but applied the Recycle Bin approach instead in later operating systems using FAT. DR DOS 6.0 and higher support <b>UNDELETE</b> as well, but optionally offer additional protection utilizing the FAT snapshot utility DISKMAP and the resident DELWATCH deletion tracking component, which actively maintains deleted files' date and time stamps and keeps the contents of deleted files from being overwritten unless running out of disk space. DELWATCH also supports undeletion of remote files on file servers. Since Novell DOS 7 the kernel will store the first letter of deleted files in the directory entries {{in order to further}} assist undeletion tools in recovering the original name. PTS-DOS offers the same feature, configurable by a SAVENAME CONFIG.SYS directive.|$|E
50|$|A {{program called}} MENU, closely {{resembling}} the PC utility XTree, facilitates complex file management tasks and {{can serve as}} a replacement shell. Other utilities allow to change disk names, search disks for files, <b>undelete</b> them, install keyboard buffer, edit system files (CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT) and so on. A port of ARC (SEA's archiver, very popular before ZIP has appeared) gives archiving facilities.|$|E
50|$|Virgin Mastertronic {{released}} {{ports of}} the arcade version for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, IBM PC, Commodore Amiga, Amstrad CPC and Atari ST in 1989. The computer ports {{were developed by}} Binary Design, the same outfit that handled the computer ports of the first game. In 2013, the Internet Archive put the <b>undeleted</b> assembly sources (DRGNSRC.LZH) of the DOS version available for download.|$|R
5000|$|The {{entry of}} the deleted file must still {{exist in the}} directory, meaning that it must not yet be {{overwritten}} by a new file (or folder) that has been created in the same directory. Whether {{this is the case}} can fairly easily be detected by checking whether the remaining name of the file to be <b>undeleted</b> is still present in the directory.|$|R
5000|$|Recuva was {{described}} by vnunet.com as an [...] "effective tool for <b>undeleting</b> or salvaging files we sent for recycling and deleted, in the past". The program works on both FAT and NTFS file systems. It is able to recover lost directory structure and automatically renames files when trying to recover two files of the same name. As of version 1.5.1 it can also recover files from Ext2 and Ext3 file systems.|$|R
5000|$|Almost {{immediately}} in September 1991, Digital Research responded with DR DOS 6.0, code-named [...] "Buxton". DR DOS 6.0, while already at BDOS level 6.7 internally, would still report itself as [...] "IBM PC DOS 3.31" [...] to normal DOS applications for compatibility purposes.This bundled in SuperStor on-the-fly disk compression, to maximize available hard disk space, and file deletion tracking and <b>undelete</b> functionality by Roger Gross.|$|E
5000|$|CHKDSK and <b>UNDELETE</b> in MS-DOS 5.0 have a bug {{which can}} corrupt data: If the file {{allocation}} table of a disk uses 256 sectors, running [...] can cause data loss and running [...] can cause unpredictable results.

50|$|The program {{filled a}} {{required}} {{niche in the}} market, as DOS shipped with only a command-line file manager, until the generally unsuccessful DOS Shell that was provided with MS-DOS 4.0. Even then, the speed and features of XTreeGold were superior — specifically support for the Zip compression format and ability to <b>undelete</b> files. The program also has the benefit of requiring very little memory, essential {{at a time when}} less than 640 kB of memory was available for programs to run.|$|E
5000|$|The first 16 {{complaints}} target different problems, from <b>undeleted</b> old [...] "pokes" [...] {{all the way}} to {{the question}} if sharing and new functions on Facebook should be opt-in or opt-out. The second wave of 6 more complaints was targeting more issues including one against the [...] "Like" [...] button. The most severe could be a complaint that claims that the privacy policy, and the consent to the privacy policy is void under European laws.|$|R
2500|$|In October 2005, Seigenthaler {{contacted}} the Chair of the Board of Trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation, Jimmy Wales, who hid affected {{versions of the}} article history from public view in the Wikipedia version logs, in effect removing them from all but Wikipedia administrators' view. In 2013, the hoax article was <b>undeleted</b> and archived to [...] Some mirror websites not controlled by Wikipedia continued to display the older and inaccurate article for several weeks until the {{new version of the}} article was propagated to these other websites.|$|R
5000|$|The {{conclusion}} of the Nord Littoral's study was [...] "If the new notoriety of Pierre Saintignon deserves an article, administrators should have let our stub stay as a starting point. Except that the debate on his notoriety must be resolved before we can proceed". In the meantime, the French Wikipedia page has been <b>undeleted</b> and submitted to a regular review. Will this incident have any influence over the election? An Encyclopedia has to wait the publication of sound scholarly research papers before reporting them.|$|R
