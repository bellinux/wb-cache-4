25|$|There is {{disagreement}} in surgical textbooks regarding {{which side}} of the recipient’s pelvis to use in receiving the transplant. Campbell's Urology (2002) recommends placing the donor kidney in the recipient’s contralateral side (i.e. a left sided kidney would be transplanted in the recipient's right side) to ensure the renal pelvis and ureter are anterior in the event that future surgeries are required. In an instance where there is doubt over whether there is enough space in the recipient’s pelvis for the donor's kidney, the textbook recommends using the right side because the right side has a wider choice of arteries and veins for reconstruction. Smith's Urology (2004) states that either side of the recipient's pelvis is acceptable; however the right vessels are 'more horizontal' with respect to each other and therefore easier to use in the anastomoses. It is unclear what is meant by the words 'more horizontal'. Glen's <b>Urological</b> <b>Surgery</b> (2004) recommends putting the kidney in the contralateral side in all circumstances. No reason is explicitly put forth; however, one can assume the rationale {{is similar to that of}} Campbell, i.e. to ensure that the renal pelvis and ureter are most anterior in the event that future surgical correction becomes necessary.|$|E

50|$|The Modified Gibson {{incision}} is a transverse incision {{above the}} pubis, frequently used in gynecological and <b>urological</b> <b>surgeries.</b> This incision {{can be made}} {{on either side of}} the midline, but often on the left.

The modified Gibson incision allows proper access to the small bowel and pelvic organs and limited access to omentum. It is also possible to have tactile assessment of large bowel and subdiaphragmatic surfaces using this incision. This incision is preferred for lymph node dissection, as extra peritoneal approach of pelvic sidewall is possible. The superior epigastric vessels and round ligament are ligated to provide easy exposure. If traction to the peritoneum is high, there is a chance for avulsion of inferior mesenteric vessels.|$|R

Patients received either 2. 5 ml of 0. 5 % hyperbaric buypivacaine 12. 5 mg (Group A), 1. 5 ml of 0. 5 % hyperbaric bupivacaine 7. 5 mg with 10 μg sufentanil (Group B) or 1. 5 ml of 0. 5 % hyperbaric bupivacaine 7. 5 mg with 25 μg butorphanol (Group C). Vital parameters, level, duration and regression of sensory block and motor block and side-effects were recorded and compared. Statistical Analysis Analysis of variance (ANOVA), post hoc test and Chi-square test were used. Results: Intrathecal addition of sufentanil/butorphanol prolonged the duration of sensory block (DOSB) compared with bupivacaine alone (DOSB being 156. 83 ± 23. 83 min, 170. 87 ± 22. 21 min and 171. 17 ± 23. 99 min in groups A, B and C, respectively) without altering the duration of motor blockade. Bromage score 3 was achieved in 100 %, 90 % and 54. 4 % patients in groups A, B and C, respectively. The time to first request for analgesia was 112 ± 46. 3 min, 323 ± 65. 0 min and 299 ± 73. 9 min in groups A, B and C, respectively. Complications were reduced by the addition of butorphanol, which also has a lower tendency than sufentanil to produce pruritus (60 %). Conclusions: The analgesia was significantly prolonged in groups B and C; group C had a less-intense motor block. Complications were reduced by the addition of butorphanol, which also has a lower tendency than sufentanil to produce pruritus. Thus, this combination of butorphanol with low-dose bupivacaine is especially beneficial in the geriatric group of patients who have multiple co-morbid conditions...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Bipolar vessel-sealing devices (VSDs) have {{advantages}} in <b>urological</b> <b>surgeries</b> (less hemorrhage, shorter operating time). However, these instruments can cause thermal injuries, which {{can result in}} neural damage and necrosis. The objectives {{of this study were}} to establish a reproducible in vitro model for standardized assessment of electrosurgical devices and to evaluate whether optimized placement of surgical instruments can reduce the thermal spread. Methods: We evaluated thermal spread of two VSDs in vitro using thin bovine muscle strips. Thermal injury was measured using an infrared camera, temperature probes and histology. The recordings were made with the VSD alone and with a rectangular clamp next to the VSD. Results: Both instruments showed a significant temperature spread of 2. 5 mm lateral to the VSD. The placement of a metal clamp next to the VSD significantly reduced the temperature spread. Histological examinations were able to underline these findings. Conclusions: In this study we describe a straightforward clinically relevant in vitro model for the evaluation of future electrosurgical instruments. We demonstrated that the thermal spread of VSD could be further reduced by optimized placement of an additional surgical instrument. Our results could help surgeons protect sensitive structures like nerves {{in the vicinity of the}} VSD...|$|R
