By comparing pA and AA reactions involving very heavy nuclei, one may be able to distinguish basic hadronic effects that dominate the dynamics in pA collisions, from a quark-gluon formation predicted to occur in heavy ion AA collisions. To gain insight into the underlyin...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the frequency in the co-rotating innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) about a compact stellar remnant can be determined through X-ray observations of low-mass X-ray binaries, and that its value can be used to constrain the equation of state of <b>ultradense</b> <b>matter.</b> Upon constructing numerical models of rapidly rotating strange (quark) stars in general relativity, we find that for stars rotating at the equatorial mass-shedding limit, the ISCO is indeed above the stellar surface, {{for a wide range of}} central energy densities at a height equal to 11 % of the circumferential stellar radius, which scales inversely with the square root of the energy density, of self-bound quark matter at zero presure. In contrast to static stars, the ISCO frequencies of rapidly rotating strange stars can be as low as 0. 9 kHz for a 1. 3 solar mass strange star. Hence, the presence of strange stars in low-mass X-ray binaries cannot be excluded on the basis of the currently observed frequencies of kHz QPOs, such as the cut-off frequency of 1066 Hz in 4 U 1820 - 30.

40|$|The X-ray sky in {{high time}} {{resolution}} holds {{the key to}} a number of observables related to fundamental physics, inaccessible to other types of investigations, such as imaging, spectroscopy and polarimetry. Strong gravity effects, the measurement of the mass of black holes and neutron stars, the equation of state of <b>ultradense</b> <b>matter</b> are among the objectives of such observations. The prospects for future, non-focused X-ray timing experiments after the exciting age of RXTE/PCA are very uncertain, mostly due to the technological limitations that need to be faced to realize experiments with effective areas in the range of several square meters, meeting the scientific requirements. We are developing large-area monolithic Silicon drift detectors offering high time and energy resolution at room temperature, with modest resources and operation complexity (e. g., read-out) per unit area. Based on the properties of the detector and read-out electronics we measured in laboratory, we built a concept for a realistic unprecedented large mission devoted to X-ray timing in the energy range 2 - 30 keV. We show that effective areas in the range of 10 - 15 square meters are within reach, by using a conventional spacecraft platform and launcher...|$|E
40|$|The LOFT mission {{concept is}} one of four {{candidates}} selected by ESA for the M 3 launch opportunity as Medium Size missions of the Cosmic Vision programme. The launch window is currently planned for between 2022 and 2024. LOFT is designed to exploit the diagnostics of rapid X-ray flux and spectral variability that directly probe the motion of matter down to distances very close to black holes and neutron stars, as well as the physical state of <b>ultradense</b> <b>matter.</b> These primary science goals will be addressed by a payload composed of a Large Area Detector (LAD) and a Wide Field Monitor (WFM). The LAD is a collimated (< 1 degree field of view) experiment operating in the energy range 2 - 50 keV, with a 10 m 2 peak effective area and an energy resolution of 260 eV at 6 keV. The WFM will operate in the same energy range as the LAD, enabling simultaneous monitoring of a few-steradian wide field of view, with an angular resolution of < 5 arcmin. The LAD and WFM experiments will allow us to investigate variability from submillisecond QPO’s to yearlong transient outbursts. In this paper we report the current status of the project. ...|$|E
40|$|AXTAR is an X-ray {{observatory}} mission concept, {{currently under}} {{study in the}} U. S., that combines very large collecting area, broadband spectral coverage, high time resolution, highly flexible scheduling, {{and an ability to}} respond promptly to time-critical targets of opportunity. It is optimized for submillisecond timing of bright Galactic X-ray sources in order to study phenomena at the natural time scales of neutron star surfaces and black hole event horizons, thus probing the physics of <b>ultradense</b> <b>matter,</b> strongly curved spacetimes, and intense magnetic fields. AXTAR's main instrument is a collimated, thick Si pixel detector with 2 - 50 keV coverage and 8 square meters collecting area. For timing observations of accreting neutron stars and black holes, AXTAR provides at least an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity over both RXTE and Constellation-X. AXTAR also carries a sensitive sky monitor that acts as a trigger for pointed observations of X-ray transients and also provides continuous monitoring of the X-ray sky with 20 times the sensitivity of the RXTE ASM. AXTAR builds on detector and electronics technology previously developed for other applications and thus combines high technical readiness and well understood cost.
