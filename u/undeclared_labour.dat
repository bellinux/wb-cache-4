50|$|Pilger {{has long}} criticised aspects of Australian {{government}} policy, particularly what he regards as its inherent racism {{resulting in the}} poor treatment of the country's indigenous population. In 1969, Pilger went with Australian activist Charlie Perkins on a tour to Jay Creek in Central Australia. He compared what he witnessed in Jay Creek to South African apartheid. He saw the appalling conditions that the Aboriginal people were living under, with children suffering from malnutrition and grieving mothers and grandmothers having had their lighter skinned children and grandchildren removed {{by the police and}} welfare agencies. Equally, he learned of aboriginal boys being sent to work on white run farms, and aboriginal girls working as servants in middle-class homes as <b>undeclared</b> slave <b>labour.</b>|$|R
40|$|The CLR-network {{examined}} in 2006 {{the phenomenon of}} <b>undeclared</b> <b>labour,</b> with specific regard to the construction sector. The resulting study, Shifting Employment: <b>undeclared</b> <b>labour</b> in construction (Shifting-study hereafter), gave evidence {{that this is an}} area particularly affected by undeclared activities with one of the highest incidence of informal labour. The sector is, in general, strongly sensitive to social dumping and unfair competition; <b>undeclared</b> <b>labour</b> is one of the irregular forms of employment that appear on the construction market 2. In this contribution the authors update some of the findings of the study, based on a small survey that was undertaken in the summer of 2014. The update is based on the national input from four countries...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} {{industry in the}} United Kingdom is characterised by extensive subcontracting, large numbers of self-employed workers and a strong pressure to drive prices ever lower. Empirical data from interviews with key persons in the industry and the literature review suggest {{that the problem of}} workers registered as self-employed for tax and social security reduction or avoidance purposes is greater than the issue of <b>undeclared</b> <b>labour</b> in the UK. <b>Undeclared</b> <b>labour</b> is widespread in the domestic sector, especially in renovation, repair and maintenance, where mostly local workers are to be found. Opinions diverge about its occurrence on larger construction sites, where it is mostly associated with migrant workers. Lack of reliable data about the size and nature of undeclared work is a major obstacle to any attempts to find ways to combat the phenomenon. No good practices have been identified in this respect; the few promising initiatives, which do not specifically address the issue but might have some positive impact, are still in the stage of being devised or implemented. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper, {{written by}} Jan Cremers (UvT) and co-authors, {{builds on the}} {{background}} paper on <b>undeclared</b> <b>labour</b> in construction prepared for the European Platform Tackling Undeclared Work. The paper describes the outcomes of a European seminar on 3 May 2017. The first section looks at the extent and nature of undeclared work in the construction sector. This is followed by {{an overview of the}} various policy approaches to tackling undeclared work in the construction sector, along with the discussions which took place at the seminar about various policy approaches and measures, particularly in relation to effective detection on construction sites, and tackling undeclared work in subcontracting chains...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the background literature, including a section on the prevailing definitions of undeclared work in construction. Following this introduction, it describes (earlier) research into the construction sector, general results and findings (Section 2). Although empirical evidence at aggregate level is still scarce, proxy evidence can be found in some sector-specific studies. Within the definitions and features section (Section 3), the role of moonlighting, i. e. performing <b>undeclared</b> <b>labour</b> alongside a regular job or self-employment, is a distinctive element of the general literature. The section on measures (Section 4) lists the existing categories, followed by examples of national initiatives recently implemented. Finally, Section 5 questions the current approach and concludes that a tailor-made policy, specifically adapted to the sector, is needed...|$|E

Swiss union officer Christopher Kelley examines the development of the construction industry over the years. Jill Wells treats the complete erosion of the labour relation {{in the case of the}} migrant workers in Qatar and Jens Lerche reports from a large project dedicated to construction labour in India and China. The second part of the subject articles is the result of the work of Erasmus student Alessia Gramuglia. During a short stay at the Amsterdam University she researched for an update of the Shifting Employment study on <b>undeclared</b> <b>labour</b> that CLR published in 2006 (as CLR-Studies 5). Also included is a review by Jan Cremers (AIAS) of the ILO-report Fair migration - Setting an ILO agenda...|$|E
40|$|First {{published}} online: 16 September 2011 The {{flexible and}} cheap labour that European “post-industrial” economies {{are in need}} of is often facilitated by <b>undeclared</b> <b>labour.</b> The undocumented migrant, from his/her part, relatively easily finds work that suits his [...] at least initial [...] plans. What lies behind this nexus between irregular migration and informal economy? To what extent can this nexus be attributed to the structural features of the so-called “secondary”, as opposed to “primary”, labour market? And how does migration policy correlate with this economic context and lead to the entrapment of migrants in irregularity? Finally, can this vicious cycle of interests and life-strategies be broken and what does the experience of the migrants indicate in this respect? This paper addresses these questions via an exploration of the grounds upon which irregular migration and the shadow economy complement each other in southern Europe (SE) and central and Eastern Europe (CEE) (two regions at different points in the migration cycle). In doing so, the dynamic character of the nexus between informal economy and irregular migration will come to the fore, and the abstract identity of the “average” undocumented migrant will be deconstructed...|$|E
40|$|In their {{notes to}} {{contributors}} {{to this issue}} of Transfer, the coordinators, Ambrosini, Cella, and Artiles, assert that ‘Today we know that irregular immigration contributes {{to the expansion of}} the underground (black) economy and informal work’. Looking back at our research on ‘undeclared labour’ carried out in 2006, we must contest their assertion. Had the coordinators included emigration, no matter whether regular or irregular, in their perspective, they might have discovered the same coincidence with ‘irregular’ work. Based on our evidence, we cannot detect any causal relationship between migration and the decline in traditional employment relationships, giving rise to various forms of what they refer to as ‘irregular work’. If a causal relationship is at work, we would rather suggest a reverse one, in that <b>undeclared</b> <b>labour</b> (‘informal work’) provides the preconditions for increased labour migration - including ‘irregular immigration’. This assessment is equally based on our research on the free movement of workers four years ago (Cremers and Donders 2004), on industrial relations in the construction industry of six former accession central and eastern European (CEE) States (Clarke et al. 2003) six years ago, and on our project on ‘Undeclared labour in construction’ in the Czech Republic, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom. Given the need for brevity in this note, we shall focus here on the results of the latter project and in particular on those findings which relate to the subject of this issue of Transfer and which pertain to our argument that ‘the underground (black) economy and informal work’ do not stem from ‘irregular immigration’. The title of the book publication stemming from this research, ‘Shifting Employment’ (Cremers and Janssen 2006), indicates our interpretation of the dynamic underlying the rise in ‘undeclared labour’...|$|E
40|$|In Social Network Analysis (SNA), {{a common}} {{approach}} to analyze two-mode network (affiliation matrix) consists on prior converting it into two one-mode adiacency matrices and examining separately each mode. Alternative methods, like factor analysis and related approaches, {{have been proposed}} to simultaneously explore relationships among actors and events. In particular, {{in the case of}} binary data a correspondence analysis can be performed to identify the underlying dimensions of the joint factorial map defined by both actors and events (Faust, 2005). Such an approach assumes actors and events to be interdependent, i. e they are simply associated among them without any direction. However, in many cases the a priori knowledge allows to assume a dependency structure for the data, i. e. the actors depend on the event, or vice versa. In such a case the classical correspondence analysis is misleading. In this contribution, we propose to use Non-Symmetrical Correspondence Analysis (NSCA) to explore the relationship structure in two-mode networks when a dependency structure between two node set can be hypothesized. The NSCA has been introduced to deal with the analytical and graphical analysis of contingency table when rows depend on columns (Lauro, D’Ambra, 1984). In the framework of SNA, the use of NSCA can be a fruitful approach to explore the association pattern in the network dependence structure. Our proposal will be applied within a research in the labour market context in Naples. The analyzed affiliation matrix has professional profiles related to undeclared works of officially unemployed people as nodes, and the professional profiles of their three most important friends as events. The aim is to analyze how the <b>undeclared</b> <b>labour</b> market position of interviewed people yields a sort of social and occupational segregation in the friendship networks...|$|E
