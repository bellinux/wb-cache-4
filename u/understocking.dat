This paper employed classical (Q, R) inventory policy in determination of optimum order quantity, optimum reorder point and optimum safety stock for the raw materials that will ensure smooth operation in the industry under study.

This model was coded in Excel tool pack and was confirmed to give instant update of inventory level at any point in time.

40|$|We {{develop an}} {{equilibrium}} {{model of a}} closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) network with multiproducts, uncertain demands, and returns. This model belongs to the context of oligopolistic firms that compete noncooperatively in a Cournot-Nash framework under a stochastic environment. To satisfy the demands, we use two different channels: manufacturing new products and remanufacturing returned products through recycling used components. Since both the demands and product returns are uncertain, we consider two types of risks: overstocking and <b>understocking</b> of multiproducts in the forward supply chain. Then we set up the Cournot-Nash equilibrium conditions of the CLSC network whereby we maximize every oligopolistic firm's expected profit by deciding the production quantities of each new product {{as well as the}} path flows of each product on the forward supply chain. Furthermore, we formulate the Cournot-Nash equilibrium conditions of the CLSC network as a variational inequality and prove the existence and the monotonicity of the variational inequality.

40|$|We {{show that}} in supply chains where {{retailer}} effort can substantially affect sales, longer leadtimes can result in higher sales for the manufacturer. Hence, under such conditions, manufacturers {{might not want to}} reduce lead times even if it was free to do so. Using a one-period model where retailer effort affects sales and is exerted after stocking quantities are determined, manufacturers and retailers have a price-only contract, leadtime from the manufacturer to retailer could be reduced to zero at no additional cost, and there is no competition (i. e., the retailer and manufacturer have exclusive contracts), we still find conditions under which manufacturers are better off sticking to longer leadtimes. If, in addition to the previous assumptions, demand follows the uniform distribution, the wholesale price is exogenously determined, and overstocking cost is equal to <b>understocking</b> cost, we show that the manufacturer will always prefer longer lead times. Next, we examine alternate contract forms, and their impact on manufacturer retailer incentives.

30|$|Comparing the {{national}} inventory data of Germany and Romania production forests (forests {{for which the}} primary goal is producing wood) we estimate that Romania may in fact lose about 13 million m 3 per year in production forest and about 15 million m 3 of wood growth annually if managed protection forests are included. This is a large number, to be handled with care, because {{it is based on}} a broad comparison of two national inventories. However, we are convinced that the order of magnitude is correct. In the present estimate we used the productivity of Germany as a base line, because these data are available, and both countries represent Central vs Eastern Europe respectively in their forest growth (TBFRA- 2000). The present estimate is based on the current age structure of Picea and Fagus mountain forest stands in Romania with wood production as a primary goal, which have a fair share of old stands (over 19  % are more than 100  years old). As a result of the very long rotations, in Romania the age-structure of forest becomes unbalanced with a high proportion of old stands and an <b>understocking</b> of young stands. A different regulation would result in a different age structure with more young stands, which would then offer a much larger productivity and more adaptability to climate change (Bouriaud and Marzano 2014), because the forest composition can be changed at twice the rate in D compared to RO.|$|E
40|$|Aim {{of study}} : In the Mediterranean, low timber-production forests are {{frequently}} thinned to promote biodiversity and reduce wildfire risk, but few {{studies in the}} region have addressed such goals. The aim of this research was to compare six thinning regimes applied to create a fuelbreak in a young Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) planted forest. Area of study : A semiarid continental high plateau in south-eastern Spain. Material and Methods : Three thinning intensities (Light, Medium and Heavy) were combined with two thinning methods: i) Random (tree selection), and ii) Regular (tree spacing). Tree growth and stand structure measurements were made four years following treatments. Main results : Heavy Random thinning successfully transformed the regular tree plantation pattern into a close-to-random spatial tree distribution. Heavy Regular thinning (followed by the Medium Regular and Heavy Random regimes) significantly reduced growth in stand basal area and biomass. Individual tree growth, in contrast, was greater in Heavy and Medium thinnings than in Light ones, which were similar to the Control. Research highlights : Heavy Random thinning seemed the most appropriate in a youngAleppo pine planted forest to reduce fire risk and artificial tree distribution simultaneously. Light Regular thinning avoids <b>understocking</b> the stand and may be the most suitable treatment for creating a fuelbreak when the undergrowth poses a high fire risk.

The objective {{of this study was}} to induce earlier and more abundant flowering, which have become key research needs for cassava. Six non- or late-flowering genotypes were selected for grafting on a profuse, early flowering <b>understock.</b> Grafted stems did not branch and flower while attached to the <b>understock.</b> Four cuttings from each grafted stem were taken and planted the following season. Paired-row cuttings from non-grafted stems of the same genotypes were planted as checks. Three phenotypic responses to grafting were found. One genotype failed to branch and flower, independently of the origin of the cuttings. Four genotypes branched but did not produce flowers. However, plants from grafted cuttings tended to branch earlier, particularly after the second branching event. Finally, in one genotype, grafting induced not only earlier branching but also earlier and more abundant production of flowers, fruits and seeds than their counterparts of plants from non-grafted stems. This is the first report of grafting effects on the induction of earlier flowering in cassava. Results indicated a delayed effect of grafting which was genotype-dependent based on materials used in this study.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{the impact of}} supply-side {{externalities}} existing among downstream retailers on supply chain performance. Namely, multiple retail firms face stochastic demand, purchase the product from the upstream wholesaler, and make stocking decisions that affect all other retailers in the same echelon. Two sources of inefficiencies exist in such a supply chain: One is double marginalization {{and the other is}} externalities among retailers. Whereas double marginalization always leads to inventory <b>understocking</b> at the retail echelon, we find that the implications of externalities are more complex, because different externalities can improve or deteriorate supply chain performance, relative to the situation without externalities. We show that the effect of externalities depends critically on whether the stocking decisions of retailers exhibit positive (complementarity) or negative (substitutability) externalities, and whether retailers are managed centrally or competitively. Under complementarity, competing retailers tend to understock the product (compared with the centralized inventory management at the retail level), thus aggravating the double-marginalization effect. This is the opposite of what happens under substitutability, where competing retailers tend to overstock the product, thus compensating for the double-marginalization effect. Hence, we conclude that supply chain coordination between retailers and the wholesaler is most important when there is downstream competition that exhibits complementarity. From the wholesaler's point of view, competition among retailers is preferable over centralization of retailers when externalities are negative, and vice versa when externalities are positive. Moreover, with competition on complements, both retailers and the wholesaler have incentives to coordinate the supply chain. supply chain, game theory, competition, Nash equilibrium, complementarity, supermodularity...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic pricing {{offers the}} {{potential}} to increase revenues. At the same time, it creates an incentive for customers to strategize over the timing of their purchases. A firm should ideally account for this behavior when making its pricing and stocking decisions. In particular, we investigate whether it is optimal for a firm to create rationing risk by deliberately <b>understocking</b> products. Then, the resulting threat of shortages creates an incentive for customers to purchase early at higher prices. But when does such a strategy make sense? If it is profitable to create shortages, what is the optimal amount of rationing risk to create? We develop a stylized model to study this problem. In our model, customers have heterogeneous valuations for the firm's product and face declining prices over two periods. Customers are assumed to have identical risk preferences and know the price path and fill rate in each period. Via its capacity choice, the firm is {{able to control the}} fill rate and, hence, the rationing risk faced by customers. Customers behave strategically and weigh the payoff of immediate purchases against the expected payoff of delaying their purchases. We analyze the capacity choice that maximizes the firm's profits. First, we consider a monopoly market and characterize conditions under which rationing is optimal. We examine how the optimal amount of rationing is affected by the magnitude of price changes over time and the degree of risk aversion among customers. We then analyze an oligopoly version of the model and show that competition reduces the firms' ability to profit from rationing. Indeed, there exists a critical number of firms beyond which a rationing equilibrium cannot be supported. dynamic pricing, capacity rationing, customer behavior, revenue management...|$|E

This contributed to significant negative influence on the surrounding forest ecosystems from enterprises of  Cherkassy industrial agglomeration. The grass cover in pine stands of Chigirinsky Bor transforms into xerophytic grasses and ruderal communities under the impact of negative biotic and abiotic factors. They are namely the anthropogenic violation of forest conditions, stands decline, recreational and industrial tree crowns <b>understocking,</b> xerophytic and heliophytic transformations of forest conditions. All the above mentioned caused strong ruderal and adventive transformation of grass cover. We registered the changes in nitrophilous plant spread regards the Cherkasy industrial agglomeration approaching which emits toxic with nitrogen-containing gases. Adventive and other non-forest species displace ferns and mosses, the ratio of ecomorfs is also changes due to increase of the quantity and development activation of annuals, xerophytic, ruderal, and nitrofil plants. The Asteraceae/Brassicaceae 3 : 1 ratio indicates significant anthropogenic violations in the region. We fixed the xerophytic, ruderal, and adventive transformation of grass cover in forest ecosystems. It is also founded the tendency of expanding the fraction of mesophilic plant species due to alterations in water regime (creation of Kremenchug reservoir and draining of floodplain Tyasmyn). When approaching the Cherkasy industrial agglomeration the grass cover degradation is clearly observed on the environmental profile. All this causes the forest ecosystem degradation and gradual loss of forest vegetation typical characteristics.

This uncertainty has to be quantified in order to plan the optimal way of conducting future business. The objective {{of this study is to}} research a case analysis of a capacity planning problem. The analyzed problem is a logistical capacity problem resembling newsvendor problem, where both overstocking and <b>understocking</b> carries an extra cost. A third party logistical company has to forecast the optimal amount of delivery trucks to hire for the next week based only on delivery data from previous deliveries. They have made a customer promise to deliver the packages on the promised date or they will be delivered for free during the next date. If they rent too few vehicles, they cannot make the deliveries on the promised date, but if they hire too many they will pay for half-empty cars for nothing. The aim of this study is to solve the optimal amount of ordered trucks for each week and to investigate if they newsvendor model is actually a suitable model for solving such problem. Methodology of the study is to first review the scientific literature of the newsvendor model and it's applications. To object is to recognize how the model should be used to evaluate the problem at hand and which factors should be used to review the outcome. After the literature review is completed, the outcome of the constructed model is reviewed under the recognized criteria.

40|$|In a {{merchandise}} depth test, {{a retail}} chain introduces new products {{at a small}} sample of selected stores for a short period prior to the primary selling season and uses the observed sales to forecast demand for the entire chain. We describe a method for resolving two key questions in merchandise testing: (1) which stores to use for the test and (2) how to extrapolate from test sales to create a forecast of total season demand for each product for the chain. Our method uses sales history of products sold in a prior season, similar to those to be tested, to devise a testing program that would have been optimal if it had been applied to this historical sample. is defined as minimizing the cost of conducting the test, plus the cost of over- and <b>understocking</b> of the products whose supply is to be guided by the test. To determine the best set of test stores, we apply a -median model to cluster the stores of the chain based on a store similarity measure defined by sales history, and then choose one test store from each cluster. A linear programming model is used to fit a formula that is then used to predict total sales from test sales. We applied our method at a large retailer that specializes in women's apparel and at two major shoe retailers, comparing results in each case to the existing process used by the apparel retailer and to some standard statistical approaches such as forward selection and backward elimination. We also tested a version of our method in which clustering was based on a combination of several store descriptors such as location, type of store, ethnicity of the neighborhood of location, total store sales, and average temperature of the store location. We found that relative to these other methods, our approach could significantly improve forecasts and reduce markdowns that result from excessive inventory, and lost margins resulting from stockouts. At the apparel retailer the improvement was enough to increase profits by more than 100 %. We believe that one reason our method outperforms the forward selection and backward elimination methods is that these methods seek to minimize squared errors, while our method optimizes the true cost of forecast errors. In addition, our approach, which is based purely on sales, outperforms descriptor variables because it is not always clear which are the best store descriptors and how best to combine them. However, the sales-based process is completely objective and directly corresponds to the retailer's objective of minimizing the understock and overstock costs of forecast error. We examined the stores within each of the clusters formed by our method to identify common factors that might explain their similar sales patterns. The main factor was the similarity in climate within a cluster. This was followed by the ethnicity of the neighborhood where the store is located, and the type of store. We also found that, contrary to popular belief, store size and location had little impact on sales patterns. In addition, this technique could also be used to determine the inventory allocation to individual stores within a cluster and to minimize lost demand resulting from inaccurate distribution across size. Finally, our method provides a logical framework for implementing micromerchandising, a practice followed by a significant number of retailers in which a unique assortment of merchandise is offered in each store (or a group of similar stores) tuned to maximize the appeal to customers of that store. Each cluster formed by our algorithm could be treated as a "virtual chain" within the larger chain, which is managed separately and in a consistent manner in terms of product mix, timing of delivery, advertising message, and store layout.

The overall reproduction of oaks was relatively poor (an average of 340 per acre and less than 20 percent milacre plot stocking) and cherrybark, Shumard, and swamp chestnut oak reproduction was probably not sufficient to recover their proportions that existed in the preharvest overstory. Water/willow oaks were more successful than the other oaks and may attain equal or higher levels in the future stand compared to the preharvest overstory. <b>Understocked</b> areas in the patches resulted primarily from development of heavy woody vine and shrub cover, with grapevine the most important problem. The eight-year stocking of oaks originated primarily from advance reproduction less than one foot tall and from post harvest germination of acorns. The contribution of large advance oak reproduction was very small, due to the very low numbers present before harvest...|$|R
3000|$|Although {{the fact}} that fire {{has always been an}} {{important}} ecological factor is recognized to a certain extent by most foresters, many of them disregard or minimize the possibility of utilizing fire as a silvicultural agent in the management of ponderosa pine forests. They refer to the past fire history of the stand as “the process of attrition” and assume that the magnificent, open pine forests found by the first white man on entering this region were but <b>understocked,</b> patchy stands, “worn down by the attrition of repeated light fires.” In the dense stands of reproduction that have come in as a “veritable blanket” under the mature stands since the advent of fire protection, they see proof of this interpretation. Show and Kotok [1924], for example, state that, “This remarkable change is in itself proof that the virgin forest as we find it does not represent the productive capacity of the land, for if an area of ground is fully occupied by a mature crop of timber the young individuals cannot obtain a foothold because the available moisture and light are fully utilized.” [...]...|$|R
