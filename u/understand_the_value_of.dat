In 1881, the wealthy industrialist Hamilton Disston of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania came to the Caloosahatchee Valley. He planned to dredge and drain the Everglades for development, as he did not <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> this unique area. Diston connected Lake Okeechobee with the Caloosahatchee River; this allowed steamboats to run from the Gulf of Mexico to Lake Okeechobee and up the Kissimmee River.|$|E

Living here and now, in Tel-Aviv, I remember our few meetings and frequently walk along Ben Yehuda Street, past his house... Sasha is difficult. He's not only difficult stylistically, but also philosophically. He offers up his immense knowledge without thinking of the reader, without glancing back at him – a knowledge of art, science, philology, naturally.

500|$|In America the Chicago {{industrialist}} Walter Paepcke, of the Container Corporation of America, {{founded the}} Aspen Design Conference after World War II {{as a way}} of bringing business and designers together – to the benefit of both. In 1951 the first conference topic, [...] "Design as a function of management", was chosen to ensure the participation of the business community. After several years, business leaders stopped attending because the increased participation of designers changed the dialogue, focusing not on the need for collaboration between business and design, but rather on the business community's failure to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> design.|$|E

500|$|Character {{designer}} Tetsuya Nomura, while exchanging e-mails with director Yoshinori Kitase {{during the}} period between the development of Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII, suggested that the game should have a [...] "school days" [...] feel. Because Nojima already had a story in mind in which the main characters were the same age, the idea worked. Thus, they created the concept of military academies, called [...] "Gardens", in which students would train to become [...] "SeeD" [...] mercenaries. Nojima also planned for the two playable parties featured in the game—Squall's present day group and Laguna Loire's group of twenty years in the past—to highly contrast with one another. Laguna's group consists of characters in their late twenties and {{have a lot of}} combat experience. They are also close friends who have fought together {{for a long time and}} trust one another. On the other hand, Squall's party is young and inexperienced, and Squall himself does not initially <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> friendship.|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} year, Akhtar {{directed}} Positive, a film produced by Shernaz Italia and Frenzy Kodaiji, starring Boman Irani and Shabana Azmi. It {{was a short}} film running for 12 minutes. Dealing with a family's attitude towards a person suffering from HIV-AIDS, the film was shot in Mumbai and aimed at creating awareness about the problem. It also introduced Arjun Mathur in the film industry. Speaking about {{the purpose of the}} project, Akhtar stated that [...] "Just as a social stigma, many people believe that an HIV patient should be isolated. They also have certain misconceptions about dealing with the disease. And since India has a lot of joint families, it becomes very important for them to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> support to the person who has acquired this disease. This is exactly what Positive talks about." [...] The film had its background score composed by Ram Sampath but had no soundtrack. It {{was a part of the}} [...] "AIDS JaaGo" [...] ("AIDS Awake"), a series of four short films, directed by Mira Nair, Santosh Sivan, Vishal Bhardwaj and himself, in a joint initiative of Mira Nair's Mirabai Films, voluntary organisations Avahan and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.|$|E

2500|$|Goddard worked {{alone with}} just {{his team of}} {{mechanics}} and machinists for many years. [...] This {{was a result of}} the harsh criticism from the media and other scientists, and his understanding of the military applications which foreign powers might use. Goddard became increasingly suspicious of others and often worked alone, except during the two World Wars, which limited the impact of much of his work. Another limiting factor was the lack of support from the American government, military and academia, all failing to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the rocket to study the atmosphere, near space, and military applications. As Germany became ever more war-like, he refused to communicate with German rocket experimenters, though he received more and more of their correspondence.|$|E
2500|$|A {{topic of}} {{interest}} for critic Muguraș Constantinescu was the regulatory status of old men and women within a Moldavian community {{in the context of}} social change, as disclosed by the Childhood Memories text. She describes David Creangă as a [...] "clan leader" [...] and [...] "enlightened man", guided by [...] "the wisdom and balance of the ripe age", who, although illiterate, is able to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> providing his grandson with a formal education. According to Constantinescu: [...] " [...] common sense is also apparent in the field of religious belief, where, as any good Christian in a Romanian village of the mid 19th century, he takes mass and behaves like a practicing Christian, but does not encourage his wife's bigotry." [...] The unnamed old man who cheats Nică out of his hoopoe, Constantinescu writes, is a figure among those who educate young Creangă by resorting to [...] "farce" [...] instead of a stern lesson in morals. Other figures she considers relevant for this analysis are Chiorpec the shoemaker, Bodrângă the performer and the various old women who function as healers.|$|E

2500|$|Following protests {{angry about}} the death of Tara, Whedon and the writing team made a {{decision}} to keep Willow gay. In 2002, he told The Advocate about the possibility of Willow having a relationship with a man, [...] "We do that now, and we will be burned alive. And possibly justifiably. We can't have Willow say, 'Oh, cured now, I can go back to cock!' Willow {{is not going to be}} straddling that particular fence. She will just be gay." [...] Kennedy is markedly different from Tara. She is younger, outspoken, and aggressively pursues Willow, who hesitates to become involved again. When they first kiss in the episode [...] "The Killer in Me", Willow's realization that she let Tara go reacts with a curse put upon her by another witch named Amy Madison (Elizabeth Anne Allen), turning Willow into Warren, Tara's murderer. The spell is broken when Willow acknowledges her guilt and Kennedy kisses her again. Kennedy expresses that she does not <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> magic and assumes it involves tricks, not the all-consuming energy that Willow is capable of. When Willow eventually exhibits what power she has, it briefly frightens Kennedy. Willow worries about becoming sexually intimate with Kennedy, unsure of what may transpire if she loses control of herself.|$|E
2500|$|Such {{publicity}} {{also made}} it into the popular press: in the post-war era Time magazine occasionally featured architects on its front cover - for instance, in addition to LeCorbusier, Eero Saarinen, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. In more recent times Time magazine has also featured Philip Johnson, Peter Eisenman, Rem Koolhaas and Zaha Hadid. Eero Saarinen is a particularly interesting case because he specialized in building Headquarters for prestigious U.S.companies, such as General Motors, CBS, and IBM, and these companies used architecture to promote their corporate images: e.g.,during the 1950s General Motors often photographed their new car models in front of their headquarters in Michigan. Corporations have continued to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> bringing in Starchitects to design their key buildings. For instance, the manufacturing company Vitra is well known for the works of notable architects that make up its premises in Weil am Rhein, Germany; including Zaha Hadid, Tadao Ando, SANAA, Herzog & de Meuron, Álvaro Siza, and Frank Gehry; as is the fashion house Prada for commissioning Rem Koolhaas to design their flagship stores in New York and Los Angeles. However, throughout history the greatest prestige has come with the design of public buildings - opera houses, libraries, townhalls, and especially museums, {{often referred to as the}} [...] "new cathedrals" [...] of our times.|$|E
