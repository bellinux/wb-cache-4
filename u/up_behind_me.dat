500|$|To comics scholar Bart Beaty, Kalo's {{giving up}} cartooning for {{familial}} duties provides the protagonist {{an opportunity to}} evaluate his own life: his failed romances, his obsessive collecting, and {{his relationship with his}} family—in particular his mother, whose home is an emotional safety zone for him. [...] The Seth character declares, [...] "I used to like to get inside cardboard boxes and close them <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b> [...] I enjoyed being in that safe, confined space. [...] My mother's place is a lot like those boxes." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{second half}} {{started off with}} Crayston briefly taking {{on the role of}} a forward, driving in a shot that Smith did well to save. Arsenal's {{forwards}} followed this with a flowing move from James, Hulme and Bastin, with the final move resulting in Bastin heading just wide of the post. Although play in the first half was relatively equal, in the second half Arsenal were the superior side, simply outclassing the Second Division Sheffield United. In the 74th minute a movement was started by James, who passed the ball to Bastin. Bastin dribbled the ball past Hooper before crossing the ball into the centre for Drake, who drove the ball into the roof of the net with his left foot. Moments after the goal United were on the attack, Barton broke down the right wing, crossing the ball in for Dodds who, finding his marker out of position, headed the ball against the bar. Dodds later said in an interview, [...] "I was just about to direct the ball down into the net when a wee fellow called Wilf Copping went <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> and, in striving to get to the ball, punched me in the back. This had the unfortunate effect of knocking my head backwards so the ball thudded against the crossbar instead of nestling itself {{in the back of the}} net. But for that, who knows, things might have turned out different." [...] Arsenal won the game with a single goal, the match having been mostly full of positive play and relatively free of fouls, although Drake was penalised on five occasions for using his elbows too much.|$|E
2500|$|In mid-March 1983, Gregg Geller, vice {{president}} of A at Epic Records, signed Double Trouble to the label at the recommendation of record producer John Hammond. Soon afterward, Epic financed a music video for [...] "Love Struck Baby", which was filmed at the Cherry Tavern in New York City. Vaughan recalled: [...] "We changed {{the name of the}} place in the video. Four years ago I got married in a club where we used to play all the time called the Rome Inn. When they closed it down, the owner gave me the sign, so in the video we put that <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> on the stage." ...|$|E

2500|$|Other unique {{themes are}} things like [...] "Garfield's Believe it or Don't", [...] "Garfield's Law", [...] "Garfield's History of Dogs", and [...] "Garfield's History of Cats", which show science, history, {{and the world}} from Garfield's point of view. Another {{particular}} theme is [...] "National Fat Week", where Garfield spends the week making fun of skinny people. Also, there was a storyline involving Garfield catching Odie eating his food and [...] "kicking Odie into next week". Soon, Garfield realizes that [...] "Lunch isn't the same without Odie. He always slips <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> barks loudly and makes me fall into my food," [...] (Garfield subsequently falls into his food by himself). A {{few days after the}} storyline began, Garfield is lying in his bed with a [...] "nagging feeling I'm forgetting something," [...] with Odie landing on Garfield in the next panel. Jon and Liz began to go out more frequently, Jon has started hiring pet sitters to look after Garfield and Odie, though they do not always work out. Two particular examples are Lillian, an eccentric (and very nearsighted) old lady with odd quirks, and Greta, a muscle bound woman who was hired to look after the pets during New Year's Eve. Most of December is spent preparing for Christmas, with a predictable focus on presents. Other Christmas themed strips include Jon's attempts at decorating the tree and house, or the attempt to buy the tree. Some years, the Christmas strips started as early as the end of November. Another example is [...] "Splut Week", when Garfield tries to avoid pies that are thrown at him. For most of Garfield's history, being hit with a pie has inevitably resulted in the onomatopoeia 'splut', hence the name.|$|E

60|$|Strive as I {{might it}} was impossible, {{during the first}} two or three minutes of the painful journey, to prevent myself from fancying that half a dozen of Thayendanega's painted wolves were {{creeping}} <b>up</b> close <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> enjoying the mental torture caused by my suspense, and then suddenly my mind was cleared of fears, even as the heavens are of clouds after a storm, as I ceased to think of what lay behind, remembering that my efforts must be successful else patriot blood might flow in streams.|$|R
6000|$|... "By and by {{they got}} all the baggage packed, and they pulled the great leather {{covering}} over it, and fastened it {{to the back of}} the bellows-top. Then I could push <b>up</b> the curtain <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> and look in at the place where the baggage was stowed. It looked like a garret. It was not quite full. There was room for several more trunks at the forward end of it.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a little}} bit creepy all alone on the wharf that night. I don't deny it. Twice I thought I 'eard {{something}} coming <b>up</b> on tip-toe <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b> The second time I was so nervous that I began to sing to keep my spirits up, and I went on singing till three of the hands of the Susan Emily, wot was lying alongside, came up from the fo'c'sle and offered to fight me. I was thankful when daylight came.|$|R
60|$|As we now possessed {{only two}} horses, it {{naturally}} fell to my lot, being a light weight compared with Big Otter, to take Eve <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Miss M'Leod came <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> in the dusk. [...] "We {{have not}} yet been introduced," [...] she said, [...] "but I suppose you are staying the night?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Then, for an instant, I fancied {{that out}} of the nearer shadows a half-seen form had stolen <b>up</b> close <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> and was {{watching}} me. Fancy or not, it caused me no fear. I turned about where I stood, and from this gentle eminence scanned the immense autumnal garden with its coursing night-birds and distant motionless woods. No; I was alone; by my Self; conscious only of an unfathomable quiet; and I stooped and took up one of the ripe fruits that had fallen to the ground. [...] "Ah, ah!" [...] called a far-away voice within me. [...] "Ah, ah! What are you at now?"--a voice like none I had ever heard in the world until that moment. Yet I raised the fruit to my lips.|$|R
5000|$|Martin, in {{the same}} interview, agreed {{that there was an}} angry exchange, but denied that he used profanity. He also said he asked {{permission}} from the dormitory desk before going to the restroom.

And eventually, {{when we got to the}} top of the stairs I became very annoyed, and expressed my annoyance to the people who were behind me." ...|$|R
60|$|Oh joy of joys! I {{was close}} to the edge of this inferno of dustheaps. Away <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> the red light of Paris was in the sky, and towering <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> rose the heights of Montmarte--a dim light, with here and there {{brilliant}} points like stars.|$|R
60|$|That same evening, as I leaned {{upon the}} {{taffrail}} watching the distant coast line of my beloved France, whose soil meseemed I {{was not like}} to tread again for years, Yvonne came softly <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E

60|$|Scarcely believing {{our good}} fortune, we all bounded towards these. In a moment I had mounted. Eve seized my hand, put her foot on my toe, and, {{with a light}} spring, seated herself <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b> Big Otter, {{vaulting}} on Salamander's steed, swung Eve's mother <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|I {{sat there}} {{nearly an hour}} before the why and the how of the little joker's actions became quite clear. This is what happens in such a case. Bunny comes down from the ridge for his nightly frolic in the little clearing. While still in the ferns the big white object, {{standing}} motionless {{in the middle of his}} playground, catches his attention; and very much surprised, and very much frightened, but still very curious, he crouches down close to wait and listen. But the strange thing does not move nor see him. To get a better view he leaps up high above the ferns two or three times. Still the big thing remains quite still and harmless. [...] "Now," [...] thinks Bunny, [...] "I'll frighten him, and find out what he is." [...] Leaping high he strikes the ground sharply two or three times with his padded hind foot; then jumps up quickly again to see the effect of his scare. Once he succeeded very well, when he crept <b>up</b> close <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> so close that he didn't have to spring up to see the effect. I fancy him chuckling to himself as he scurried off after my sudden start.|$|R
6000|$|FAITH. Then it came burning hot into my mind, {{whatever}} he said, and however he flattered, {{when he got}} home to his house he would sell me for a slave. So I bid him forbear, for I would not come near the door of his house. Then he reviled me, and told me that he would send such a one after me that should make my way bitter to my soul. So I turned to go away from him; but, just as I turned myself to go thence, I felt him take hold of my flesh, and give me such a deadly twitch back, that I thought he had pulled part of me after himself: this made me cry, [...] "O wretched man!" [...] So I went on my way up the hill. Now, when I had got about half-way <b>up,</b> I looked <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> and saw one coming after me, swift as the wind; so he overtook me just about the place where the settle stands.|$|R
60|$|CISSY CAFFREY: I was {{in company}} with the {{soldiers}} and they left me to do--you know, {{and the young man}} run <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b> But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.|$|E
6000|$|... '"Be {{sure your}} sins {{will find you}} out," [...] says Torrigiano. [...] "Go with him and see." [...] As I {{followed}} Bob out I was aware of Benedetto, like a black spot when the eyes are tired, sliddering <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It's quite simple," [...] {{said the}} bushman. [...] "Mr. Clavering and I didn't quite agree. He had a billet {{in his hand}} when he crept <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> and somehow we fell into the crockery. I didn't mean to damage him, {{but he wanted to}} get away, you see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You behaved as I {{expected}} {{you would}} do," [...] Turenne said, {{when he entered}} his room on hearing the bell sound. [...] "You fought close to me {{as long as there}} was fighting to be done, and I observed that you used your sword well. The moment I drew rein you did the same, and took <b>up</b> your post <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> showing that although this was your first battle you retained your coolness. I will therefore tell you in confidence that Count d'Harcourt has enjoined me to throw provisions, if possible, into the citadel at Turin. It will take me some time to make arrangements, and my only fear is that the garrison, on hearing that we have retired across the Po--of which you may be sure the Spaniards will take care to inform them--may believe that we shall do no more this winter; and as we know that their provisions must be well nigh exhausted, they will abandon the citadel and march thither.|$|R
60|$|Then it {{occurred}} to me, all in an instant of course, that a man would not begin to shout like that for nothing; at any rate when his supper was concerned. So I glanced <b>up</b> above and <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b> To this moment I can remember exactly what I saw. There was the granite water-worn boulder, or rather several boulders, with ferns growing in their cracks of the maiden-hair tribe, most of them, but some had a silver sheen on the under side of their leaves. On one of these leaves, bending it down, sat a large beetle with red wings and a black body engaged in rubbing its antennæ with its front paws. And above, just appearing {{over the top of}} the rock, was the head of an extremely fine leopard. As I write to seem to perceive its square jowl outlined against the arc of the quiet evening sky with the saliva dropping from its lips.|$|R
5000|$|Bugs then {{offers a}} free shot at himself; fakes an {{elaborate}} death; and plays dead, leaving Elmer miserable with remorse; but survives the shot and sneaks <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> the despairing Fudd, kicks {{him in his}} rear, shoves a cigar into his mouth, and tiptoes away, ballet-style. Finally, the frustrated Elmer walks away sobbing about [...] "wabbits, cawwots, guns", etc. Bugs then begins to play his carrot like a fife, playing the tune The Girl I Left <b>Behind</b> <b>Me,</b> and marches with one stiff leg towards his rabbit hole (recalling The Spirit of '76).|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{held out}} her ’and, and while the skipper was shaking it I began to {{walk back to the}} wharf. I ’adn’t gorn far afore I heard ’im coming <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> and next moment ’e was walking {{alongside}} and saying things to try and make me lose my temper.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's {{the first}} part. Then I hear bare feet {{running along the}} alleyway. One of the scalded men comes <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> and says quite distinctly, [...] "My friend! All is lost!" [...] Then he taps me on the {{shoulder}} and I hear him drop down dead.' He panted and wiped his forehead.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Come, Hubert,' Charley said, dashing {{away the}} tears from his eyes, 'do not let us waste a moment. All hope may not be over. The Indians seldom kill women, but carry them away, and she may be alive yet. If she is, we will rescue her, if we go right across America. Come, man, jump <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> on my horse.' ...|$|E
60|$|Once {{or twice}} I {{asked what was}} the matter, but the people {{neglected}} answering me, and I was not very importunate; but after the crowd was wholly past, I took my opportunity to turn about and take <b>up</b> what was <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> and walk away. This, indeed, I did with less disturbance than I had done formerly, for these things I did not steal, but they were stolen to my hand. I got safe to my lodgings with this cargo, which {{was a piece of}} fine black lustring silk, and a piece of velvet; the latter was but part of a piece of about eleven yards; the former was a whole piece of near fifty yards. It seems it was a mercer's shop that they had rifled. I say rifled, because the goods were so considerable that they had lost; for the goods that they recovered were pretty many, and I believe came to about six or seven several pieces of silk. How they came to get so many I could not tell; but as I had only robbed the thief, I made no scruple at taking these goods, and being very glad of them too.|$|R
60|$|After this {{no other}} Fung {{appeared}} upon the wall, so I turned {{my attention to}} the spy-hole in the doors <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> and seeing some horsemen moving about {{at a distance of}} four or five hundred yards on a rocky ridge where the mist did not lie, I opened fire on them and at the second shot was fortunate enough to knock a man out of the saddle. One of those with him, who must have been a brave fellow, instantly jumped down, threw him, dead or living, over the horse, leaped <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> him, and galloped away accompanied by the others, pursued by some probably ineffective bullets that I sent after them.|$|R
5000|$|Clyde didn't want {{to believe}} that the docile W.D. had {{deliberately}} abandoned the gang, but to Buck it was obvious, and a relief, that [...] "the kid" [...] had. Jones made his way back to Dallas and spoke with Mrs. Barrow at least once while he was there. In late May the gang sent Blanche to Dallas to bring money and news to the families; Barrow instructed her to bring Jones with her to their rendezvous. When Blanche passed this request on, both mothers were polite, but demurred; Mrs. Barrow told Blanche faintly that [...] "she did not know if he wanted to go with Clyde or not"; LC and Mrs. Parker at least pretended to try to find him. Barrow arranged at least one more meeting, expressly asking his mother to find and return Jones then, but to no avail. Finally he and Parker drove into Dallas and picked him up themselves, on June 8 or 9. In his statement to Dallas police Jones said, [...] "About two o'clock in the afternoon.... I was walking along the road intending {{to go down to the}} lake and to go to a dance at the Five Point Dancehall that night. Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow drove <b>up</b> from <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> and stopped. They were in a V8 Coupe....They spoke to me and told me to get in the car and I got in. They asked me if I wanted to go with them, and I told them I did not, and Clyde said I was going anyway, and I did." [...] After this, even when the five-person gang had two cars, [...] "Clyde always wanted W.D. to be in the car with him." ...|$|R
