6000|$|So he {{told her}} with much amusing detail after his fashion. She listened quietly with a {{puckered}} <b>up</b> <b>brow</b> and only made one comment. It was,-- ...|$|E
60|$|And so old Granny Fox {{puckered}} <b>up</b> her <b>brows</b> {{and thought}} and thought, {{trying to find}} some good reason why Farmer Brown's boy should have been hunting in the summertime.|$|R
60|$|The {{sudden change}} in her, the towering fury and intense abhorrence {{sparkling}} {{in her eyes}} and lighting <b>up</b> her <b>brow,</b> made him stop as if a fire had stopped him.|$|R
60|$|Happy Jack {{said that}} he hadn't seen any, and Striped Chipmunk remarked that he couldn't waste any more time talking, and scurried away. Happy Jack watched him go, a puzzled little frown {{puckering}} <b>up</b> his <b>brows.</b>|$|R
60|$|He returned, smiling to himself, and {{carrying}} {{in his hand}} a silk handkerchief. The long stupid wrinkles ran <b>up</b> Davis's <b>brow</b> as he saw it. What should it contain? He {{could think of nothing}} more recondite than a revolver.|$|R
60|$|She looked <b>up</b> suddenly. Her <b>brows</b> {{met in a}} frown of bewilderment. Clearly this {{interested}} her. Again was she drawn.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to her prestigious editorial and red carpet work, Hrush has hosted beauty tours around the globe; most recently, she traveled to Dubai for the Make <b>Up</b> Forever <b>BROW</b> SHOW. [...] Additionally, Hrush recently collaborated with Tarte™ Cosmetics; together they launched the limited edition SYLED BY HRUSH eye and cheek palette.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tis {{a perfect}} paradise!" [...] exclaimed Tom Collins, as they reined <b>up</b> on the <b>brow</b> {{of a hill}} to gaze at the {{magnificent}} prospect before them.|$|R
60|$|Very {{early one}} morning Paddy the Beaver heard Sammy Jay making a terrible fuss over in the aspen trees {{on the edge of}} the pond Paddy had made in the Green Forest. Paddy couldn't see because he was inside his house, and it has no window, but he could hear. He {{wrinkled}} <b>up</b> his <b>brows</b> thoughtfully.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Longways looked <b>up</b> {{under his}} <b>brows</b> {{at me with}} a very curious leer. [...] "Did you ever hear," [...] says he, [...] "of The Rose of Paradise?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Clarissa {{felt that}} she was {{blushing}} <b>up</b> to her <b>brow,</b> but she made a great effort to compose herself. [...] "Oh, no," [...] she said, [...] "we all know of it." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{soon as she}} saw Neale {{she forgot}} every one else in that hall. He was gambling. He did not look <b>up.</b> His <b>brow</b> was somber and dark. She approached--stood behind him. Some of the players spoke to her, familiarly, as was her bitter due. Then Neale turned {{apparently}} to bow with his old courtesy. Thrill on thrill coursed over her. Always he had showed her respect, deference.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not like you!" [...] said Mrs. Lovel, {{putting her}} hand <b>up</b> to his <b>brow</b> and pushing away his hair. Was it {{possible}} that any girl should not like such a man as that, and he an earl? ...|$|R
60|$|The doctor, {{unable to}} refuse, seated {{himself in the}} shaving-chair, trembling, half with fear and half with rage, and by this time quite {{unconscious}} of the lather which Nello had laid on with such profuseness. He deposited his medicine-case on his knees, took out his precious spectacles (wondrous Florentine device!) from his wallet, lodged them carefully above his flat nose and high ears, and lifting <b>up</b> his <b>brows,</b> turned towards the applicant.|$|R
50|$|The Observer (Air and Earth): A {{scientist}} type {{person with}} round spectacles pushed <b>up</b> above his <b>brow,</b> mostly bald head with white {{hair at the}} sides; his left hand is held up to his chin, he looks thoughtful.|$|R
50|$|In 1904, Marconi’s Wireless Telegraph Co. Ltd. {{entered into}} a {{contract}} with the Commissioners of Irish Lights to put telegraphic equipment and aerials on the Fastnet Rock. The telegraphic station was moved <b>up</b> to <b>Brow</b> Head where the signal tower equipment had been used for so long to contact passing ships. Messages were sent to the Fastnet Rock Lighthouse by signalling methods and then relayed to the Brow Head station by wireless telegraphy for relaying on to the recipients.|$|R
6000|$|Tu-Kila-Kila pursed <b>up</b> his <b>brow</b> {{and looked}} preternaturally wise, as the savage loves to do. [...] "But the parrot," [...] he cried, [...] "the Soul of all dead parrots! He knew the secret, they say:--I taught it him myself {{in an ancient}} day, many, many years ago--when no man now living was born, save only I--in another incarnation--and he may have told it. For the strangers, they say, speak the {{language}} of birds; and {{in the language of}} birds did I tell the Great Taboo to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|We had {{all three}} pulled <b>up</b> on the <b>brow</b> of the hill; and now I marched {{across the road}} and {{addressed}} my uncle. [...] "I think it right to tell you, sir," [...] says I, [...] "there's nothing that will bring me on board that Covenant." ...|$|R
6000|$|Who will go {{drive with}} Fergus now, [...] And pierce the deep wood's woven shade, [...] And dance upon the level shore? [...] Young man, lift <b>up</b> your russet <b>brow,</b> [...] And lift your tender eyelids, maid, [...] And brood on {{hopes and fears}} no more.|$|R
6000|$|Then was Claire {{certain that}} the {{waitress}} was baiting her, for the amusement of {{the men at the}} long table. She exploded. Probably the waitress did not know there had been an explosion when Claire looked coldly <b>up,</b> raised her <b>brows,</b> looked down, and poked the cold and salty slab of ham, for she was continuing: ...|$|R
5000|$|The Emperor of {{the kingdom}} dolorous / From his mid-breast forth issued from the ice; /And better with a giant I compare / Than do the giants with those arms of his; / Consider now how great must be that whole, / Which unto such a part {{conforms}} itself. / Were he as fair once, as he now is foul, / And lifted <b>up</b> his <b>brow</b> against his Maker, / Well may proceed from him all tribulation. / O, what a marvel it appeared to me, / When I beheld three faces on his head! / The one in front, and that vermilion was; ...|$|R
6000|$|Then his frantic hands fell by {{his sides}} {{and he looked}} <b>up</b> under his <b>brows</b> with an {{expression}} that went well with his hard breathing. Madeleine Durand {{had come to a}} halt at first in childish wonder, and now, with more than masculine self-control, [...] "I fancy I know your face, sir," [...] she said, as if to gain time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Harry {{does not}} grudge the effort," [...] said Flora. [...] "I grudge it for him. It was mainly for my sake he went abroad and overtaxed his {{strength}} in an unhealthy climate {{in order to}} make Wyndhams' prosperous." [...] She stopped and looked <b>up,</b> knitting her <b>brows.</b> [...] "Here is the little man I saw on board the steamer! I wonder what he wants." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} {{boundary of}} the fell is formed by the walkers pass from Longsleddale to Mosedale, which crosses a marshy depression at 1,555 ft. Mosedale beck has its source here, beginning its long journey north east to Swindale. Beyond the depression the ground rises again northward <b>up</b> Selside <b>Brow</b> to Branstree, the highest Lakeland top east of Longsleddale. South of Tarn Crag is another boggy col, separating the fell from its near twin, Grey Crag. This holds the diminutive Greycrag Tarn, actually {{a series of small}} pools on the bed of a larger body of water. The tarn empties into Longsleddale via Galeforth Gill, but issuing eastwards from the same marsh is Little Mosedale Beck.|$|R
5000|$|In no fix'd {{place the}} happy souls reside. In groves we live, and lie on mossy beds, By crystal streams, that murmur thro' the meads: But pass yon easy hill, and thence descend; The path conducts {{you to your}} journey's end.” This said, he led them <b>up</b> the mountain's <b>brow,</b> And shews them all the shining fields below. They wind the hill, and thro' the blissful meadows go. Virgil, Aeneid (6.641) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'That's queer,' said Old Mother Nature {{to herself}} {{and went over to}} examine a bush. Hanging on to a branch for dear life she saw a queer little fellow who was so busy that he didn't see her at all. It was little Mr. Frog. He was {{catching}} bugs as fast as he could. Old Mother Nature wrinkled <b>up</b> her <b>brows.</b> 'Now however did he learn to climb?' thought she. Then she hid where she could watch. By and by she saw little Mr. Frog tumble out of the bush, because, you know, the pitch on his hands had worn off. He hurried over to a pine-tree and rubbed more pitch on and then jumped up into the bush and went to work again.|$|R
60|$|When the child, with eager haste, {{stated the}} object of her visit, and wound up her {{discourse}} with the earnest remark that her father must be stopped, and mustn't be took, her small counsellor looked as perplexed and anxious as herself. Wrinkling <b>up</b> his smooth <b>brow,</b> he expressed the belief {{that it was a}} difficult world to deal with, and he had had some trouble already in finding out how to manage it.|$|R
6000|$|The King of Thessaly and the Queen of Heaven {{exchanged}} a glance {{and entered the}} saloon. Jove looked <b>up</b> with a <b>brow</b> of thunder, but did not condescend to send forth a single flash of anger. Jove looked up and Jove looked down. All Olympus trembled as the Father of Gods and men resumed his soup. The rest of the guests seemed nervous and reserved, except Cupid, who said immediately to Juno, 'Your Majesty has been detained?' ...|$|R
50|$|Sika stags have stout, upright antlers with {{an extra}} {{buttress}} <b>up</b> from the <b>brow</b> tine and a very thick wall. A forward-facing intermediate tine breaks the line to the top, which is usually forked. Occasionally, sika antlers develop some palmation (flat areas). Females carry a pair of distinctive black bumps on the forehead. Antlers can range from 28 to 45 cm to more than 80 cm, depending on the subspecies. Stags also have distinctive manes during the rut.|$|R
60|$|The leaf, in one {{particular}} stage, when {{nearly all the}} prismatic colours are blended on its surface, is often converted by the natives into a superb and striking head-dress. The principal fibre traversing its length being split open a convenient distance, and the elastic sides of the aperture pressed apart, the head is inserted between them, the leaf drooping on one side, with its forward half turned jauntily <b>up</b> on the <b>brows,</b> and the remaining part spreading laterally behind the ears.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was a sunny morning {{toward the}} close of May, when Brant and his warriors {{cautiously}} moved <b>up</b> to the <b>brow</b> of the lofty hill {{on the east side}} of the town (Cherry Valley) to reconnoitre the settlement at their feet. He was astonished and chagrined on seeing a fortification where he supposed all was weak and defenceless, and greater was his disappointment when quite a large and well-armed garrison appeared upon the esplanade in front of Colonel Campbell's house.|$|R
60|$|James {{looked at}} his daughter-in-law. That unseen glance of his was cold and dubious. Appeal and fear were in it, {{and a sense of}} {{personal}} grievance. Why should he be worried like this? It was very likely all nonsense; women were funny things! They exaggerated so, you didn't know what to believe; and then, nobody told him anything, he had to find out everything for himself. Again he looked furtively at Irene, and across from her to Soames. The latter, listening to Aunt Juley, was looking <b>up,</b> under his <b>brows</b> in the direction of Bosinney.|$|R
60|$|They had, in the meantime, been {{mounting}} a rising ground, clothed with stunted wood, {{and came out}} on a wide heath, brown with dead bracken; a hollow, traced by the tops of leafless trees, marked {{the course of the}} stream that traversed it, and the inequalities of ground becoming more rugged in outlines and grayer in colouring as they receded, till they were closed by a dark fir wood, beyond which rose in extreme distance the grand mass of Welsh mountain heads, purpled against the evening sky, except where the crowning peaks bore a veil of snow. Behind, the sky was pure gold, gradually shading into pale green, and then into clear light wintry blue, while the sun sitting behind two of the loftiest, seemed to confound their outlines, and blend them in one flood of soft hazy brightness. Dr. May looked at his son, and saw his face clear <b>up,</b> his <b>brow</b> expand, and his lips unclose with admiration.|$|R
6000|$|What wrecked the Roman power? One says vice, [...] Another indolence, another dice. [...] Emascle says polygamy. [...] "Not so," [...] Says Impycu--"'twas {{luxury and}} show." [...] The parson, lifting <b>up</b> a <b>brow</b> of brass, [...] Swears superstition gave {{the coup de}} grâce, [...] Great Allison, the statesman-chap affirms [...] 'Twas lack of coins (croaks Medico: [...] "'T was worms") [...] And John P. Jones the swift {{suggestion}} collars, [...] Averring the no coins were silver dollars. [...] Thus, through the ages, each presuming quack [...] Turns the poor corpse upon its rotten back, [...] Holds a new [...] "autopsy" [...] and finds that death [...] Resulted partly from the want of breath, [...] But chiefly from some visitation sad [...] That points his argument or serves his fad. [...] They're all in error--never human mind [...] The cause of the disaster has divined. [...] What slew the Roman power? Well, provided [...] You'll keep the secret, I will tell you. I did.|$|R
60|$|The way ran deviously {{through a}} maze of buildings. They came at last to a passage that curved about, and showed {{broadening}} before him an oblong opening, clouds hot with sunset, and the ragged skyline of the ruinous Council House. A tumult of shouts came drifting up to him. In another moment they had come out high <b>up</b> on the <b>brow</b> of the cliff of torn buildings that overhung the wreckage. The vast area opened to Graham's eyes, none the less strange and wonderful for the remote view he had had of it in the oval mirror.|$|R
60|$|In {{time came}} they to {{discourse}} of Cervantes, {{and of the}} new painter, Rubens, that is beginning to be heard of. Fine words and dainty-wrought phrases from the ladies now, {{one or two of}} them being, in other days, pupils of that poor ass, Lille, himself; and I marked how that Jonson and Shaxpur did fidget to discharge some venom of sarcasm, yet dared they not in the presence, the queene's grace being ye very flower of ye Euphuists herself. But behold, these be they yt, having a specialty, and admiring it in themselves, be jealous when a neighbor doth essaye it, nor can abide it in them long. Wherefore 'twas observable yt ye quene waxed uncontent; and in time labor'd grandiose speeche out of ye mouth of Lady Alice, who manifestly did mightily pride herself thereon, did quite exhauste ye quene's endurance, who listened till ye gaudy speeche was done, then lifted <b>up</b> her <b>brows,</b> and with vaste irony, mincing saith 'O shit!' Whereat they alle did laffe, but not ye Lady Alice, yt olde foolish bitche.|$|R
