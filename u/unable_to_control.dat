5|$|In Batwoman: Futures End #1, {{five years}} into the future, Kate Kane {{was turned into a}} vampire and <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> her thirst for blood, she began attacking people. She was {{eventually}} killed, when her sister Beth drove a stake through her heart.|$|E
5|$|Jason Grace: Demigod son of Jupiter, the Roman {{aspect of}} Zeus. In an {{audition}} with Auster, the Roman deity of the South Wind, he reveals his preference for Camp Half-Blood instead of Camp Jupiter, and the god forces him {{to commit to}} his choice. During the battle against the monsters in the Doors of Death, Jason is <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the Diocletian's scepter because of his choice.|$|E

5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation by}} the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) confirmed the aircraft had impacted birds during take-off. Due to loss {{of power in the}} left engine, the flight crew were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> their aircraft before it struck the roof of the apartment building. The investigation further determined the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and officials at DeKalb–Peachtree Airport were aware of the danger of birds at the airport after a landfill site had opened {{in the vicinity of the}} airport ten years before the accident.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the summer, Wolfe's focus changed, possibly due to frustration with Montcalm's tactics. Wolfe's troops, along with American Rangers, attacked and destroyed small French settlements along the St. Lawrence. An estimated 1,400 stone houses and manors were destroyed, and many colonists killed. The effort was likely an attempt to force Montcalm's army out of its fortifications, but was unsuccessful. However, the attacks did reduce the amount of supplies available to the French, especially as the British navy, <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the St. Lawrence entirely, was successfully blockading the ports in France.|$|E
5|$|In the Kalika Purana, Varaha - Vishnu’s boar avatar - had amorous dalliance {{with the}} earth goddess. He and his three boar sons then created mayhem in the world, which necessitated Shiva to {{take the form of}} Sharabha, to kill the Varaha form. Even, Vishnu {{requests}} Shiva to destroy Varaha, <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> his own form. Here, Narasimha appears to aid Varaha. Sharabha kills Narasimha first and then kills Varaha, allowing Vishnu to reabsorb the energies of both his fierce forms. Finally, Vishnu defeats Sharabha.|$|E

25|$|Though {{the invaders}} were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> take <b>control,</b> the {{political}} system remained unstable. Regional rivalries contributed to the gradual disintegration of Bhutan {{at the time the}} first British agents arrived.|$|R
5|$|Ladislaus vanquished a Cuman {{army that}} invaded Hungary in 1282. Hungary also survived a Mongol {{invasion}} in 1285. Ladislaus had, by that time, become so unpopular {{that many of}} his subjects accused him of inciting the Mongols to invade Hungary. After he imprisoned his wife in 1286, he lived with his Cuman mistresses. During the last years of his life, he wandered throughout the country with his Cuman allies, but he was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the most powerful lords and bishops any more. Pope Nicholas IV planned to declare a crusade against him, but three Cuman assassins murdered Ladislaus.|$|E
5|$|The steel casket {{containing}} the gold is traced {{by the police}} allowing them to track down Diabolik's hideout. They close in on Diabolik, who is melting the gold and turning it into ingots. Because the police are shooting at him, Diabolik is <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the heating of the gold, and the whole cavern ends up being covered in molten gold. Again, Diabolik {{is believed to be}} dead, with his heat-proof suit now covered in solidified gold. The police seal off the cavern intending to recover the gold later. Eva is allowed to pay her respects to Diabolik, who winks at her.|$|E
5|$|With 1,300 deputies {{still in}} Cripple Creek, Sheriff Bowers was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the army he had created. On June 5, the deputies moved into Altman, {{perhaps as a}} prelude to {{storming}} Bull Hill. The deputies cut the telegraph and telephone wires leading out of town, and imprisoned a number of reporters. Concerned that the paramilitary force might get out of hand, Waite again dispatched the state militia, this time under the command of General E.J. Brooks.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about Shvarn and his rule, but historians believe he was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> take <b>control</b> of all Lithuania, and ruled only over its {{southern}} portions. He died in 1269 or 1271 in Galicia.|$|R
5|$|A riot {{that lasted}} four days broke out on November 2 when strikebreakers {{attempted}} to restart transit services. At its height, {{eight to ten}} thousand rioters flooded downtown Indianapolis and vandalized the city's main business district. Numerous workers, strikebreakers, policemen, and bystanders were injured. Two strikebreakers and four union members were killed. The city police were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the situation and refused orders to combat the rioters as the violence worsened. After pleas for help from city leaders following continued rioting on Election Day, Governor Samuel Ralston called out the Indiana National Guard and put the city under martial law {{on the evening of}} November 5.|$|E
5|$|As Peter and Lois {{are having}} sex, she yells out George Clooney's name, so Peter realizes {{that she is}} imagining him as Clooney to {{maintain}} her libido. Lois and Peter decide {{to take a second}} honeymoon to enliven their marriage, and leave their anthropomorphic dog Brian {{to take care of their}} children Stewie, Chris, and Meg. Brian is <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the children, but Stewie offers to help (in exchange for Brian changing his diaper) and together they manage the home. The pair chaperone a dance at Chris's school, during which a school staff member catches Chris in the boys' restroom with vodka that belongs to his classmate Jake Tucker. Although Brian and Stewie punish Chris by grounding him, they try to clear his name. Jake's father Tom refuses to believe Brian and Stewie, so they resort to planting cocaine in Jake's locker, and Jake is sentenced to community service.|$|E
5|$|Goldfinger was premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on 17 September 1964, {{with general}} release in the United Kingdom the {{following}} day. Leicester Square {{was packed with}} sightseers and fans and police were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the crowd due {{to the number of}} people. A set of glass doors to the cinema was accidentally broken and the premiere was shown ten minutes late because of the confusion. The United States premiere occurred on 21 December 1964, at the DeMille Theatre in New York. The film opened in 64 cinemas across 41 cities and eventually peaked at 485 screens. Goldfinger was temporarily banned in Israel because of Gert Fröbe's connections with the Nazi Party. The ban, however, was lifted many years later when a Jewish family publicly thanked Fröbe for protecting them from persecution during World War II.|$|E

50|$|A Shaun Johnson in-goal grubber was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> be <b>controlled</b> by South’s fullback Malcolm Webster and Elijah Taylor {{was first}} on the scene to slap a hand on it. Johnson {{converted}} for the Warriors to lead 6-0.|$|R
5|$|Limousin muscling is {{intermediate}} {{to that of}} British cattle breeds such as Angus, Hereford, and Shorthorn and {{the extreme}} double muscling found in the European Belgian Blue and Piedmontese breeds. Studies of double-muscled cattle identified natural mutations of the myostatin gene which produce inactivated proteins that are <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> muscle development. In Belgian Blue and Piedmontese cattle this causes an increase in muscle mass of 20–25%. Subsequent studies identified a less extreme myostatin mutation known as F94L associated with Limousins. The resulting partially active protein results in Limousins having intermediate muscle development, which avoids the extreme muscling and associated disadvantages of double muscled cattle.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool got {{the first}} half of extra time under way, but the start was slow as players {{suffered}} with cramp, Carragher in particular. In the 97th minute, Liverpool won a corner, which West Ham cleared to Liverpool defender John Arne Riise {{on the edge of the}} penalty area, but his shot went over the crossbar. Liverpool won another corner in the 99th minute, which was cleared by West Ham; the ball came back into the penalty area and Morientes headed down for Cissé, but he was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the ball. Before the end of the half, Hyypiä had a chance to score after running past Scaloni and Harewood, but his shot went wide of the West Ham goal.|$|E
5|$|On September 21, Neuer made an {{appearance}} as a relief pitcher {{in a game}} against the Detroit Tigers, taking over for Bill Hogg due to the latter's ineffectiveness. His next appearance as a starter was against the St. Louis Browns. He was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the baseball due to rain; the 5–2 game was called after six innings as a result, giving Neuer his second loss. His final appearance of the season was on October 3 against the Chicago White Sox. In that game, he allowed three hits in an 8–0 victory for his third and final shutout of the season. Neuer spent the offseason working as a hotel clerk, and after signing a contract for the 1908 season, he joined the team for spring training.|$|E
5000|$|The {{flight crew}} was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> regain <b>control</b> due <b>to</b> airspeed, {{inverted}} nose-down position, and insufficient altitude. The flight crew {{did manage to}} reduce the angle of descent from 45° to 40° before hitting the ground at over 300 mi/h km/h.|$|R
50|$|Startups, shutdowns, and {{malfunctions}} (SSM) are {{periods of}} non-continuous operation in refineries, chemical plants or similar industrial facilities. During such temporary periods, these plants might emit larger amounts of pollution, {{and therefore the}} pollution abatement equipment may be <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> effectively <b>control</b> it.|$|R
50|$|However, a VLAN {{on its own}} is <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> {{enforce the}} <b>control</b> of privileged {{information}} - it doesn't understand applications, users and content.|$|R
5|$|Six {{months after}} the alien {{substance}} Terrigen was released into the ecosystem, Joey Gutierrez developed metal-melting abilities. <b>Unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> this power, Gutierrez is confronted in the streets by soldiers {{who are willing to}} use lethal force to detain him. Gutierrez is saved by S.H.I.E.L.D., and Inhuman agent Daisy Johnson attempts to explain to him that he is also an Inhuman, with a dormant gene within him that was activated by the Terrigen. Struggling to help Gutierrez accept what has happened to him, Johnson seeks the help of Lincoln Campbell, the Inhuman who helped her transition but has now renounced the ways of the Inhumans, wishing to live a normal life.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} an {{immediate}} success when published– by Beilby and Bewick themselves– in 1797. Just prior to its publication, Bewick published an anthology in 1795 {{on the study of}} character in the Kings and Queens of England. Given the success of the 1797 publication of his bird illustrations, Bewick started work at once on the second volume, Water Birds, but the disagreement over authorship led to a final split with Beilby. Bewick was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> his feelings and resolve issues quietly, so the partnership ended, turbulently and expensively, leaving Bewick with his own workshop. Bewick had to pay £20, equivalent to about £20,400 in 2011, in lawyer's fees, and more than £21 for Beilby's share of the workshop equipment.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} the day started early in the morning when skirmishes broke out in a bar, which led to an Arsenal fan being stabbed. Later in the day, Galatasaray fans {{occupied}} City Hall Square before heading towards Arsenal fans in bars nearby. The Galatasaray fans were later attacked from behind by members of British hooligan firms seeking revenge for the Istanbul stabbings. Despite deploying 2,000 officers to the area and having prior warning of potential trouble, the police were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the riot until they fired tear gas at the rioters. This led to 19 injuries, including 4 stabbings, and 60 arrests with similar events occurring in England and Turkey {{in the aftermath of the}} riots.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{widespread}} vaccination, pertussis {{has persisted}} in vaccinated populations {{and is one}} of the most common vaccine-preventable diseases. The recent resurgence in pertussis infections is put down to a combination of waning immunity and new mutations in the pathogen that existing vaccines are <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> effectively <b>control.</b>|$|R
50|$|Manager Jeff Torborg, who {{had come}} off two {{consecutive}} winning seasons with the Chicago White Sox, found himself <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> maintain <b>control</b> of the team. He had a particularly testy relationship with outfielder Vince Coleman, which eventually resulted in the former stolen base king's suspension in September.|$|R
5000|$|His niece Jacqueline went to England in 1421 {{and married}} the king's brother, Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester. She was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> retain <b>control</b> over Holland and Hainaut much longer after John's death.
