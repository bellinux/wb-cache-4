25|$|Before {{touching}} the contact lens or the eye, {{it is important}} to wash hands thoroughly with soap and rinse well. Soaps containing moisturizers or allergens should be avoided as these can cause eye irritation. Drying of hands using towels or tissues prior to handling contact lenses can transfer lint (fluff) to the hands and, subsequently, to the lenses, causing irritation <b>upon</b> <b>insertion.</b> Towels, unless freshly laundered on high temperature wash, are frequently contaminated with large quantities of bacteria and, as such, should be avoided when handling lenses. Dust, lint and other debris may collect on the outside of contact lenses. Again, hand contact with this material, prior to handling contact lenses, may transfer it to the lenses themselves. Rinsing the case under a source of clean running water, prior to opening it, can help alleviate this problem. Next the lens should be removed from its case and inspected for defects (e.g. splits, folds, lint). A 'gritty' or rough appearance to the lens surface may indicate that a considerable quantity of proteins, lipids and debris has built up on it and that additional cleaning is required; this is often accompanied and felt by unusually high irritation <b>upon</b> <b>insertion.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Database {{normalization}} is {{a central}} part of database design in which we re-organise the data stored so as to progressively ensure that as few anomalies occur as possible <b>upon</b> <b>insertions,</b> deletions and/or modifications. Successive normalizations of a database to higher normal forms continue to reduce the potential for such anomalies. We show here that database normalization follows as a consequence (or special case, or byproduct) of the Minimum Message Length (MML) principle of machine learning and inductive inference. In other words, someone (previously) oblivious to database normalization but well-versed in MML could examine a database and- using MML considerations alone- normalise it, and even discover the notion of attribute inheritance...|$|R

40|$|Metric access methods {{based on}} {{hyperplane}} partitioning have the advantage, {{compared to the}} ballpartitioning-based ones, that regions do not overlap. The price is less flexibility for controlling the tree shape, especially in the dynamic scenario, that is, <b>upon</b> <b>insertions</b> and deletions of objects. In this paper we introduce a technique called ghost hyperplanes, which enables fully dynamic data structures based on hyperplane partitioning. We apply the technique to Brin’s GNAT static index, obtaining a dynamic variant called EGNAT, which in addition we adapt to secondary memory. We show experimentally that the EGNAT is competitive with the M-tree, the baseline for this scenario. We also apply the ghost hyperplane technique to Voronoi trees, obtaining a competitive dynamic structure for main memory...|$|R

We analyze the expected costs to search, insert and delete a random element. The resulting data structure, randomized median-of-k jumplists, is competitive to other dictionary implementations and supports particularly efficient iteration in sorted order and selection by rank. We further show that omitting jump pointers in small sublists hardly affects search costs, but significantly reduces the memory consumption. If space is tight and rank-select is needed, median-of-k jumplists are a promising option in practice. Comment: (v 2 only corrects typos in figures...|$|R
