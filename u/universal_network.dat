2500|$|Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider (1915–1990) was {{a faculty}} member of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and {{researcher}} at Bolt, Beranek and Newman. He developed {{the idea of a}} <b>universal</b> <b>network</b> at the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) of the United States Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). He headed IPTO from 1962 to 1963, and again from 1974 to 1975. His 1960 paper [...] envisions that mutually-interdependent, [...] "living together", tightly-coupled human brains and computing machines would prove to complement each other's strengths.|$|E
2500|$|The Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) was {{introduced}} {{as part of}} the Wired for Management framework by Intel and is described in the specification published by Intel and SystemSoft. PXE version 2.0 was released in December 1998, and the update 2.1 was made public in September 1999. The PXE environment makes use of several standard client‑server protocols like DHCP and TFTP (now defined by the 1992 published RFC 1350). Within the PXE schema the client [...] side of the provisioning equation is now {{an integral part of the}} PXE standard and it is implemented either as a Network Interface Card (NIC) BIOS extension or today in modern devices as UEFI code. This distinctive firmware layer makes available at the client the functions of a basic <b>Universal</b> <b>Network</b> Driver Interface (UNDI), a minimalistic UDP/IP stack, a Preboot (DHCP) client module and a TFTP client module, together forming the PXE application programming interfaces (APIs) used by the NBP when needing to interact with the services offered by the server counterpart of the PXE environment. TFTP's low throughput, especially when used over high-latency links, has been initially mitigated by the TFTP Blocksize Option RFC 2348 published in May 1998, and later by the TFTP Windowsize Option RFC 7440 published in January 2015.|$|E
