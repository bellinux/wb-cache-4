2500|$|The {{idea of the}} Luxembourg Summit {{was further}} {{elaborated}} at the European Council in Maastricht on 9–10 December 1991, a meeting to draft the Maastricht Treaty. The European Council agreed to create [...] "a European police office (Europol) the initial function {{of which would be}} to organize exchange of information on narcotic drugs". The Council likewise instructed TREVI ministers to take measures in setting up the office. On 7 February 1992, Europol was enshrined with more substance in Article K.1, section 9, as the Maastricht Treaty was signed: Member States shall regard the following areas as matters of common interest: [...] police cooperation for the purposes of preventing and combatting terrorism, <b>unlawful</b> <b>drug</b> <b>trafficking</b> and other serious forms of international crime, including if necessary certain aspects of customs cooperation, in connection with the organization of a Union-wide system for exchanging information within a European Police Office (Europol).Europol was first de facto organised provisionally in 1993 as the Europol Drugs Unit (EDU) in Strasbourg at the same site as the Schengen Information System was hosted. The small initial group started operations there in January 1994 under the leadership of Jürgen Storbeck and with a mandate to assist national police forces in criminal investigations. The competition for the permanent site of Europol during the period was between The Hague, Rome and Strasbourg—the European Council decided on 29 October 1993 that Europol should be established in The Hague. A former Catholic boys school built in 1910 at Raamweg 47 was chosen as the precise location. The house was used in World War II by police and intelligence agencies and after the War manned by the Dutch State Intelligence Service until Europol relocated there later in 1994.|$|E

50|$|<b>Drug</b> <b>Trafficking</b> is {{a global}} issue. The United States has {{attempted}} to regulate drug-related crimes since the first implemented Act, known as the Drug Importation Act which was passed in 1848.

Illicit <b>drug</b> <b>traffic</b> is international in nature. A drug illicitly produced in one country often ends up in another country, changing hands many times in different countries. This international nature of illicit <b>drug</b> <b>traffic</b> warrants effective and concerted international action to fight it. Since the harms of drug abuse and the problems of illicit <b>drug</b> <b>traffic</b> {{came to the attention of}} the international community in the early part of this century, efforts have been exerted to establish and improve an international legal framework to provide principles and guidelines for effective national and international action in the control of drugs and the fight against illicit <b>drug</b> <b>traffic.</b> Several multilateral <b>drug</b> treaties have been concluded to that end.
