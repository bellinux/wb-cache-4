50|$|In {{some cases}} the {{fundamental}} group of a manifold can {{be shown to be}} linear by using representations coming from a geometric structure. For example, all closed surfaces of genus at least 2 are hyperbolic Riemann surfaces. Via the <b>uniformisation</b> theorem this gives rise to a representation of its fundamental group in the isometry group of the hyperbolic plane, which is isomorphic to PSL2(R) and this realises the fundamental group as a Fuchsian group. A generalisation of this construction is given by the notion of a (G,X)-structure on a manifold.|$|E

50|$|In {{probability}} theory, uniformization method, (also {{known as}} Jensen's method or the randomization method) {{is a method}} to compute transient solutions of finite state continuous-time Markov chains, by approximating the process by a discrete time Markov chain. The original chain is scaled by the fastest transition rate γ, so that transitions occur {{at the same rate}} in every state, hence the name <b>uniformisation.</b> The method is simple to program and efficiently calculates an approximation to the transient distribution at a single point in time (near zero). The method was first introduced by Winfried Grassmann in 1977.|$|E

50|$|The Internet {{helped to}} bring about the growing <b>uniformisation</b> of ritual {{practices}} across the Slavic Native Faith movement. The first Rodnover website on Russian Internet (so-called Runet)—was established by a Moscow-based believer in 1996. Many Rodnovers made use of Russian Wikipedia to promote their religion, although many found the process difficult and switched focus to promulgating Slavic Native Faith through LiveJournal and mail.ru, through which they could express their own views more directly. From the mid-2000s, Rodnovers made increasing use of social media to communicate with other members of their community. Russian Rodnovery also attracted the attention of academics, many of whom focused on the political dimensions of the movement, thus neglecting other aspects of the community. Aitamurto later criticised some of this Russian-language material for reflecting scholars' own religious biases against Rodnovery, over-reliance on the published texts of prominent figure, or for sensationalising the subject to shock or impress their audience. This generated some mutual hostility between academics and practitioners, rendering subsequent scholarly fieldwork more difficult.|$|E
5000|$|In 1913 Hermann Weyl {{published}} his classic textbook [...] "Die Idee der Riemannschen Fläche" [...] {{based on his}} Göttingen lectures from 1911 to 1912. It was the first book to present the theory of Riemann surfaces in a modern setting and through its three editions has remained influential. Dedicated to Felix Klein, the first edition incorporated Hilbert's treatment of the Dirichlet problem using Hilbert space techniques; Brouwer's contributions to topology; and Koebe's proof of the uniformization theorem and its subsequent improvements. Much later [...] developed his method of orthogonal projection which gave a streamlined approach to the Dirichlet problem, also based on Hilbert space; that theory, which included Weyl's lemma on elliptic regularity, was related to Hodge's theory of harmonic integrals; and both theories were subsumed into the modern theory of elliptic operators and [...] Sobolev spaces. In the third edition of his book from 1955, translated into English in , Weyl adopted the modern definition of differential manifold, in preference to triangulations, but decided not {{to make use of}} his method of orthogonal projection. [...] followed Weyl's account of the <b>uniformisation</b> theorem, but used the method of orthogonal projection to treat the Dirichlet problem. This approach will be outlined below.
