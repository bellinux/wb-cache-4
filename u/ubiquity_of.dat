5|$|A central {{organizing}} {{concept in}} biology is that life changes and develops through evolution, {{and that all}} life-forms known have a common origin. The theory of evolution postulates that all organisms on the Earth, both living and extinct, have descended from a common ancestor or an ancestral gene pool. This universal common ancestor of all organisms {{is believed to have}} appeared about 3.5 billion years ago. Biologists regard the <b>ubiquity</b> <b>of</b> the genetic code as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent for all bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes (see: origin of life).|$|E

40|$|Today's {{distributed}} database systems {{adhere to}} the principle <b>of</b> <b>ubiquity</b> such that all the information is everywhere available in an equitable fashion. This transparent data distribution leads to at least two severe problems. First, the complexity becomes unmanageable if one tries to impose a centralized control upon the computer model of the "real" world, that is naturally distributed. Second, if at all possible, the centralized control <b>of</b> <b>ubiquity</b> would be prohibitively expensive in terms of performance. We argue that the paradigm <b>of</b> <b>ubiquity</b> should be replaced by object autonomy in a distributed, persistent environment. The objects have built-in control over many important aspects that were previously controlled centrally: the life cycle, the cooperation control, and the distribution control. We describe the functionality of such an autonomous object model in metaphorical terms, concentrating on internal object aspects, inter-object communication and distributed infrastructure. We [...] ...|$|R

Avascular necrosis resulting from the bends was completely absent in fossils of the genus Clidastes, suggesting that it preferred to stay near the surface.

The presence and <b>ubiquity</b> <b>of</b> the avascular necrosis is consistent with the idea that these were deep diving animals.|$|E

40|$|High <b>ubiquities</b> <b>of</b> maize, {{coupled with}} other {{evidence}} of extended occupations at large Early Agricultural period {{sites in the}} floodplain of the Middle Santa Cruz River, Tucson Basin, suggest an early commitment to cultivation, and {{raise questions about the}} settlement-subsistence system. Large, exceptionally well preserved faunal assemblages at these sites indicate that game made a significant dietary contribution during permanent or semi-permanent occupations with subsistence systems centered on cultivated and collected plants. To investigate diachronic changes in the selection and use of faunal resources during the transition to agricultural dependence and sedentism, estimates of available biomass, archaeofaunal assemblages, and their depositional contexts from several floodplain sites are compared. Accompanying the trends of increasing population, sedentism, and agricultural commitment, predicted changes include a decreasing frequency of artiodactyls, increasing intensity of processing of large game, an increase in the ratio of jackrabbits to cottontails, and evidence of increasing activities in communal space. Analyses of disposal contexts with primary, secondary, and de facto faunal refuse at six floodplain sites dating to the Cienega and Agua Caliente phases yielded evidence supporting these predictions. Intersite variability indicates site-specific solutions relating to settlement growth. Changes in the patterns of bone disposal in abandoned structures, short-lived intramural pits, and extramural processing features indicate that, over time, communal activities may have increased in response to faunal resource stress...|$|R
