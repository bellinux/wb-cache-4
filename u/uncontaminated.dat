5|$|This {{incident}} {{along with}} the next continental US tests in 1951 set a precedent. In subsequent atmospheric nuclear tests at the Nevada test site, United States Atomic Energy Commission officials gave the photographic industry maps and forecasts of potential contamination, as well as expected fallout distributions, which enabled them to purchase <b>uncontaminated</b> materials and take other protective measures.|$|E
5|$|A {{supply of}} easily {{accessible}} <b>uncontaminated</b> water and good sanitation practices {{are important for}} reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis. Personal measures (such as hand washing with soap) {{have been found to}} decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%. Alcohol-based gels may also be effective. Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally. Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration. Avoiding contaminated food or drink should also be effective.|$|E
5|$|Testing program staff {{originally}} {{set test}} Charlie for early 1947. They wanted to explode it deep {{under the surface}} {{in the lee of}} the atoll to test the effect of nuclear weapons as depth charges on unmoored ships. The unanticipated delays in decontaminating the target ships after test Baker prevented the required technical support personnel from assisting with Charlie and also meant that there were no <b>uncontaminated</b> target ships available for use in Charlie. The naval weapons program staff decided the test was less pressing given that the entire U.S. arsenal had only a handful of nuclear weapons and cancelled the test. The official reason given for cancelling Charlie was that the program staff felt it was unnecessary due {{to the success of the}} Able and Baker tests. The deep ocean effects testing that Charlie was to have performed were fulfilled nine years later with Operation Wigwam.|$|E
5|$|To {{prove their}} discoveries beyond any doubt, the Curies sought to isolate {{polonium}} and radium in pure form. Pitchblende {{is a complex}} mineral; the chemical separation of its constituents was an arduous task. The discovery of polonium had been relatively easy; chemically it resembles the element bismuth, and polonium was the only bismuth-like substance in the ore. Radium, however, was more elusive; it is closely related chemically to barium, and pitchblende contains both elements. By 1898 the Curies had obtained traces of radium, but appreciable quantities, <b>uncontaminated</b> with barium, were still beyond reach. The Curies undertook the arduous task of separating out radium salt by differential crystallization. From a ton of pitchblende, one-tenth of a gram of radium chloride was separated in 1902. In 1910, she isolated pure radium metal. She never succeeded in isolating polonium, which has a half-life of only 138 days.|$|E
5|$|Several {{recent studies}} attempt {{to examine the}} effects of chronic low-dose {{manganese}} overexposure on child development. The earliest study was conducted in the Chinese province of Shanxi. Drinking water there had been contaminated through improper sewage irrigation and contained 240–350µg Mn/L. Although Mn concentrations at or below 300µg Mn/L were considered safe at the time of the study by the US EPA and 400µg Mn/L by the World Health Organization, the 92 children sampled (between 11 and 13 years of age) from this province displayed lower performance on tests of manual dexterity and rapidity, short-term memory, and visual identification, compared to children from an <b>uncontaminated</b> area. More recently, a study of 10-year-old children in Bangladesh showed a relationship between Mn concentration in well water and diminished IQ scores. A third study conducted in Quebec examined school children between the ages of 6 and 15 living in homes that received water from a well containing 610µg Mn/L; controls lived in homes that received water from a 160µg Mn/L well. Children in the experimental group showed increased hyperactive and oppositional behavior.|$|E
25|$|In anoxic sediments <b>uncontaminated</b> {{by heavy}} metals, the {{associated}} metal (M in equation 2) is usually iron (Fe) or manganese (Mn). Iron (II) is abundant in anoxic sediment, and the Ksp for iron (II) sulfide is 10−22.39 (with a comparable value for manganese (II) sulfide), so effectively all the sulfide in an <b>uncontaminated</b> sediment will be bound to Fe or Mn.|$|E
25|$|Another {{test was}} {{conducted}} by investigators. This time, they conducted the test to know if hydraulic fluids of Flight 420 would ignite when it contacted the hot surface of the brake assembly. Investigators used two kinds of hydraulic fluids; the contaminated and <b>uncontaminated</b> one. The result was that an intense fire broke out after it contacted with the hot surface. The test also revealed that the contaminated hydraulic fluids have lower ignition point than the <b>uncontaminated</b> one.|$|E
25|$|Example {{disciplines}} are: die-lubricant management (Use of <b>uncontaminated</b> and homogeneous mixtures, {{amount and}} placement of lubricant). Tight control of die temperatures and surface finish / friction.|$|E
25|$|A similar Japanese product, Aquabeads, {{which was}} {{developed}} in Japan by Epoch Co. Ltd, and is produced by a different Chinese manufacturer, has not been recalled and is <b>uncontaminated.</b>|$|E
25|$|The metal (M) is {{transformed}} from solid {{form to the}} dissolved form. In <b>uncontaminated</b> sediment, M will mostly {{be a combination of}} Fe and Mn. In contaminated sediments, toxic heavy metals such as Cd, Pb, etc. will also be liberated by the reaction.|$|E
25|$|For instance, the astrobionibbler is a {{sensitive}} tool proposed for Mars {{that would be}} able to detect a single amino acid in a gram of sample. If the sample is already contaminated by Earth life, then the discovery of an amino acid in it would be of considerably less interest than if it were <b>uncontaminated.</b>|$|E
25|$|On some Wankel engines the sump oil remains <b>uncontaminated</b> by the {{combustion}} process, so no oil changes are required. The {{oil in the}} mainshaft is totally sealed from {{the combustion}} process. The oil for Apex seals and crankcase lubrication is separate. In piston engines the crankcase oil is contaminated by combustion blow-by through the piston rings.|$|E
25|$|Glass items {{which have}} been {{contaminated}} with a biohazardous material will be treated with the same concern as needles and blades, even if unbroken. If glass is <b>uncontaminated,</b> it is still often treated as a sharp, because it can break during the disposal process. Contaminated plastic items which are not sharp can be disposed of in a biohazardous waste receptacle instead of a sharps container.|$|E
25|$|Micropropagation {{techniques}} {{can be employed}} to disinfest plants of a virus. In the growing tip of a plant, cell division is so rapid that the younger cells {{may not have had}} time to be infected with the virus. The rapidly growing region of meristem cells producing the shoot tip is cut off and placed in vitro, with a very high probability of being <b>uncontaminated</b> by virus.|$|E
25|$|Geology and {{geologic}} principles can {{be applied}} to various environmental problems such as stream restoration, the restoration of brownfields, and the understanding of the interaction between natural habitat and the geologic environment. Groundwater hydrology, or hydrogeology, is used to locate groundwater, which can often provide a ready supply of <b>uncontaminated</b> water and is especially important in arid regions, and to monitor the spread of contaminants in groundwater wells.|$|E
25|$|It is however, {{critical}} to diver safety that the compressor {{is suitable for}} breathing air delivery, uses a suitable oil, is adequately filtered, and takes in clean and <b>uncontaminated</b> air. Positioning of the intake opening is important, and {{may have to be}} changed if the relative wind direction changes, to ensure that no engine exhaust gas enters the intake. Various national standards for breathing air quality may apply.|$|E
25|$|The {{hot springs}} {{flow from the}} western slope of Hot Springs Mountain, part of the Ouachita Mountain range. In the park, the hot springs have not been {{preserved}} in their unaltered state as natural surface phenomena. They have instead been managed to conserve the production of <b>uncontaminated</b> hot water for public use. The mountains within the park are also managed within this conservation philosophy {{in order to preserve}} the hydrological system that feeds the springs.|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} {{is generally}} avoided {{as far as}} is reasonably practicable by positioning of the air intake in <b>uncontaminated</b> air, filtration of particulates from the intake air, use of suitable compressor design and appropriate lubricants, and ensuring that running temperatures are not excessive. Where the residual risk is excessive, a hopcalite catalyst {{can be used in}} the high pressure filter to convert carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide, which is far less toxic.|$|E
25|$|Another {{measure of}} human faecal {{contamination}} is {{the proportion of}} the two 3β-ol isomers in the 5β form. 5α-cholestanol is formed naturally in the environment by bacteria and generally does not have a faecal origin. Samples with ratios greater than 0.7 may be contaminated with human faecal matter; samples with values less than 0.3 may be considered <b>uncontaminated.</b> Samples with ratios between these two cut-offs can not readily be categorised {{on the basis of this}} ratio alone.|$|E
25|$|Waste {{containing}} unusually low BOD concentrations {{may fail}} to sustain the secondary treatment population required for normal waste concentrations. The reduced population surviving the starvation event {{may be unable to}} completely utilize available BOD when waste loads return to normal. Dilution may be caused by addition of large volumes of relatively <b>uncontaminated</b> water such as stormwater runoff into a combined sewer. Smaller sewage treatment plants may experience dilution from cooling water discharges, major plumbing leaks, firefighting, or draining large swimming pools.|$|E
25|$|The same {{applies to}} other more complex biosignatures. Searching for {{biological}} {{remains of the}} precursors to life, whether ancient or currently existing, would be far easier on an <b>uncontaminated</b> planet. This would similarly apply to searches for DNA sequences on Mars. Life on other planets could have a common origin with Earth life, since in the early Solar System there was much exchange of material between the planets which could have transferred life as well. If so it might be based on DNA too.|$|E
25|$|The city {{prohibited}} {{all access}} to the downtown (including Frontenac, Thibodeau, Durand Streets and the boulevard des Vétérans) until June 2014 to permit a massive decontamination effort. Soil decontamination was expected to take until December 2014 to complete, although the water table appeared to be <b>uncontaminated.</b> Some buildings that were still standing, such as the local post office in Lac-Mégantic, were a total loss due to oil contamination. It may take {{up to five years}} to decontaminate some sites where homes formerly stood, forcing householders to rebuild elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|During {{the time}} of the Roman Empire, the area around Genzano was used by wealthy Roman {{citizens}} for its clean air, <b>uncontaminated</b> water and cooler temperatures during the hot summer months. The lake has its own microclimate and is protected from wind by the crater walls. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Lord Byron and Charles Gounod all lived in Nemi and saw the magical reflection of the Moon seen {{in the center of the}} lake during summer. This phenomenon is the source of the Roman name for the lake, Speculum Dianae (Diana's Mirror).|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} Dejevsky, Lugovoi and Epstein overlooks {{the fact that}} Litvinenko's wife, while {{contaminated}} with polonium, left no polonium trail, unlike Litvinenko, Lugovoi and Kovtun. Lugovoi and Kovtun left more significant traces than Litvinenko. This means that Litvinenko {{could not have been}} the source of the polonium. In addition the bus that Litvinenko travelled into London on 1 November, traced by his use of an Oyster card, was <b>uncontaminated.</b> In contrast, Lugovoi and Kovtun had left traces of polonium at various locations in London over the previous month.|$|E
25|$|Federally {{recognized}} Indigenous Nations {{and states}} protect designated areas by adopting {{water quality criteria}} {{that allow them to}} adopt the criteria that EPA publishes under §304(a) of the CWA, modify the §304(a) criteria to reflect site-specific conditions or adopt criteria based on other scientifically defensible methods. Water quality criteria can be numeric criteria that toxicity causes are known for protection against pollutants. A narrative criterion is water quality criteria which serves as basis for limiting toxicity of waste discharge to aquatic species. A biological criterion is based on aquatic community which describes the number and types of species in a water body. A nutrient criterion solely protects against nutrient over enrichment; and a sediment criterion describes conditions of contaminated and <b>uncontaminated</b> sediments in order to avoid undesirable effects.|$|E
25|$|The copepods can {{be added}} to water-storage {{containers}} where the mosquitoes breed. Copepods, primarily of the genera Mesocyclops and Macrocyclops (such as Macrocyclops albidus), can survive for periods of months in the containers, if the containers are not completely drained by their users. They attack, kill, and eat the younger first- and second-instar larvae of the mosquitoes. This biological control method is complemented by community trash removal and recycling to eliminate other possible mosquito-breeding sites. Because the water in these containers is drawn from <b>uncontaminated</b> sources such as rainfall, the risk of contamination by cholera bacteria is small, and in fact no cases of cholera have been linked to copepods introduced into water-storage containers. Trials using copepods to control container-breeding mosquitoes are underway in several other countries, including Thailand and the southern United States. The method, though, would be very ill-advised in areas where the guinea worm is endemic.|$|E
25|$|As well as {{linking the}} two series {{into a single}} future history, the present book served to address a {{criticism}} leveled against the largely radioactive Earth as depicted in Pebble in the Sky and mentioned in several other books. Though not explicitly stated, there was the clear implication the world being mostly radioactive and humans precariously surviving in the <b>uncontaminated</b> areas in between {{was the result of}} a nuclear war hundreds or thousands of years before the time of the plot. This would have made Pebble in the Sky part of the post-nuclear war subgenre common in the 1950s. It was, however, pointed out by critics that such an extensive use of nuclear weapons as to leave persistent and widespread radiation even after centuries would have completely destroyed all life on Earth at the moment when it took place. Therefore, in the present book Asimov provided a different origin for the future Earth's radioactivity.|$|E
25|$|For {{practical}} purposes, different {{measures of}} location and dispersion are often compared {{on the basis}} of how well the corresponding population values can be estimated from a sample of data. The median, estimated using the sample median, has good properties in this regard. While it is not usually optimal if a given population distribution is assumed, its properties are always reasonably good. For example, a comparison of the efficiency of candidate estimators shows that the sample mean is more statistically efficient than the sample median when data are <b>uncontaminated</b> by data from heavy-tailed distributions or from mixtures of distributions, but less efficient otherwise, and that the efficiency of the sample median is higher than that {{for a wide range of}} distributions. More specifically, the median has a 64% efficiency compared to the minimum-variance mean (for large normal samples), which is to say the variance of the median will be ~50% greater than the variance of the mean—see asymptotic efficiency and references therein.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th Century {{vaccination}} {{was done}} either directly with vaccine produced on the skin of calves or, particularly in England, with vaccine obtained from the calf but then maintained by arm-to-arm transfer; initially in both cases vaccine could be dried on ivory points for short term storage or transport but increasing use was made of glass capillary tubes for this purpose towards {{the end of the}} century. During this period there were no adequate methods for assessing the safety of the vaccine and there were instances of contaminated vaccine transmitting infections such as erysipelas, tetanus, septicaemia and tuberculosis. In the case of arm-to-arm transfer there was also the risk of transmitting syphilis. Although this did occur occasionally, estimated as 750 cases in 100 million vaccinations, some critics of vaccination e.g. Charles Creighton believed that <b>uncontaminated</b> vaccine itself was a cause of syphilis. Smallpox vaccine was the only vaccine available during this period, and so the determined opposition to it initiated a number of vaccine controversies that spread to other vaccines and into the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|The {{open circuit}} scuba set is usually stored and often transported as {{separate}} major components - harness, cylinder(s) and regulator(s), and usually buoyancy compensator, and assembled shortly before use. The scuba set is {{life support equipment}} and correct assembly and function {{is critical to the}} success of the dive, and in some cases to the survival of the user. The equipment is robust and reliable, is easily tested for correct function, and assembly is simple enough for the user after basic instruction and some practice. Some service providers will assemble scuba sets for their clients, particularly if it is rental equipment, but all certification agencies require the diver to be competent to assemble their own set. Scuba assembly generally entails mounting the cylinder(s) on the harness, connecting the regulator(s) to the cylinder valves, ensuring an <b>uncontaminated</b> and pressure-tight seal, and connecting the low pressure hose to the buoyancy compensator inflation valve. These operations usually require no tools, or at most a wrench, used to bolt twin cylinders to a backplate. Validating the function of the regulator and inflation valve is usually considered part of scuba assembly, but may also be considered part of pre-dive checks, and if there is a significant interval between assembly and use, is commonly done twice.|$|E
25|$|Before {{a diving}} {{operation}} {{it is usually}} necessary {{to set up the}} surface supply equipment. There are a number of components which must be connected in the correct order, with checks at various stages to ensure that there are no leaks and everything functions correctly. Most diving contractors will have comprehensive checklists that are used to ensure that the equipment is connected in the appropriate sequence and all checks are done. Some checks are critical to the safety of the diver. The compressor must be set up so that it gets <b>uncontaminated</b> air to the intake. Filters should be checked in case they need to be changed. Air supply hoses will be connected to the air panel and checked for leaks, umbilicals connected to the panels and helmets, and the communications equipment connected and tested. Before the umbilical is connected to the helmet or full face mask, the umbilical should be blown through to ensure there is no dirt inside, and the non return valve on the bailout block must be given a function test. This is important, as it is there to prevent backflow of air up the umbilical if the line is cut, and if it fails the diver may suffer a helmet squeeze, or a neck dam flood.|$|E
500|$|In {{polarography}} {{both the}} dropping mercury electrode [...] and the hanging mercury drop electrode [...] use elemental mercury. This use allows a new <b>uncontaminated</b> electrode {{to be available}} for each measurement or each new experiment.|$|E
500|$|As {{a part of}} the {{scrapping}} process, {{sections of}} [...] pre-atomic steel plate <b>uncontaminated</b> with radionuclides were recovered from Vanguard and used for the shielding of the whole body monitor at the Radiobiological Research Laboratory (now DSTL) at Alverstoke, Gosport in Hampshire, England.|$|E
500|$|Leschi is {{designed}} to operate with a complement of four personnel, but has a command and communications room for use by senior SFD officers {{in the event of}} a catastrophe that renders land facilities unusable. [...] The ship is outfitted with a CBRN defense system for crew protection {{in the event of a}} nuclear or chemical weapons attack against Seattle, or similar disaster. When activated, the system automatically seals pressurized hatches to the bridge and command center; <b>uncontaminated</b> air is provided by a fan and filter system.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{from the}} {{scientific}} community state that no valuable information can be obtained until they can test clean samples of lake water, <b>uncontaminated</b> by drilling fluid. [...] Regardless of the contamination issues, in May 2013 the drilling facility at the Russian Vostok Antarctic station was declared a historic monument as [...] "the result of {{the recognition of the}} achievements of the Russian research of Antarctica by the international scientific community, and of the unique operations on opening the subglacial Lake Vostok performed by Russian scientists on February 5, 2012." ...|$|E
500|$|All ships leak {{and require}} the regular {{operation}} of bilge pumps to stay afloat. If their bilge pumps {{could not be}} operated, the target ships would eventually sink. [...] Only one suffered this fate: Prinz Eugen, which sank in the Kwajalein lagoon on December 22. The rest were kept afloat {{long enough to be}} deliberately sunk or dismantled. [...] After the August 10 decision to stop decontamination work at Bikini, the surviving target fleet was towed to Kwajalein Atoll where the live ammunition and fuel could be offloaded in <b>uncontaminated</b> water. The move was accomplished during the remainder of August and September.|$|E
