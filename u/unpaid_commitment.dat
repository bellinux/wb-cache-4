40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the impact of <b>unpaid</b> <b>commitments</b> by the central government on public healthcare financing and national health expenditure estimates. The health spending data were obtained from the federal public budget system, Siga Brasil, and were analyzed for their registration as <b>unpaid</b> <b>commitments</b> and canceled <b>unpaid</b> <b>commitments</b> from 2002 to 2014. We found that healthcare spending by the federal government was lower than the minimum level required by law for most years. As a result, approximately R$ 11. 3 billion were not allocated to public healthcare by the federal government. As for health expenditure estimates, we found that the cancellation of <b>unpaid</b> <b>commitments,</b> among other issues related to national public accounting, affects the estimation of health spending by the accrual method, which is the recommended regimen in health accounts...|$|R
40|$|Thirty cities at {{the center}} of the nation's most populous {{metropolitan}} areas faced more than $ 192 billion in <b>unpaid</b> <b>commitments</b> for pensions and other retiree benefits, primarily health care, as of fiscal 2009. These cities had a long-term shortfall of $ 88 billion for pensions and $ 104 billion for retiree health care and other non-pension benefits...|$|R
50|$|Winning {{the double}} {{combined}} with some fine European outings during previous season raised the fans' expectations considerably as they now wanted the existing Red Star squad {{to be kept}} intact (especially Nikola Žigić who reportedly at the time became a target of some high-profile English Premiership clubs) {{in order to make}} a serious run at qualifying for the UEFA Champions League. However, the first move came as a complete shock - president Stojković sold goalkeeper Vladimir Stojković to FC Nantes, reportedly for €3 million. Trying to deal with the angry fan reaction, he attempted to explain that the move had been necessary to cover the club debt that grew to alarming levels following years of mismanagement and <b>unpaid</b> <b>commitments</b> of some key sponsor pool members. The wholesale continued with Nenad Kovačević, Milan Dudić, Haminu Dramani, Aleksandar Luković, and Boško Janković also leaving, but their departures caused comparatively less angry fan reaction. However most were still disappointed to see the winning team disassembled and sold off so quickly.|$|R
40|$|Households {{provide their}} members with both {{financial}} support and caring services. In sole parent households, {{the functions of}} earning money and caring for children fall to one individual. Current government policy favours work force participation as {{the solution to the}} higher poverty rates in lone parent families, but this may have a mirror effect on their ability to provide care. There {{is a great deal of}} research into the financial impacts of sole motherhood, but very little into the amount of time that sole parents' devote to care of their children, and what this means for their total (paid and <b>unpaid)</b> work <b>commitments.</b> In this paper I address this research gap. I analyse the Australian Bureau of Statistics Time Use Survey 1997 (over 4000 randomly selected households), to compare sole and couple parents' overall time commitments to paid and unpaid work and to investigate whether time spent with children in lone parent and couple-headed families differs in type or quantity...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{concept of}} {{perceived}} control {{is central to}} many theories of physical and emotional well-being. However, existing measures are lengthy and generally focus on job control. In epidemiological research, brief measures and those which can be applied across entire populations are needed. Among women in particular, a substantial minority have no paid work, while most also have major <b>unpaid</b> family <b>commitments</b> which may affect well-being through their effect on control. Thus, we evaluated the six-item Life Control Scale (Bobak, Soc Sci Med. 47 : 269 – 79, 1998) with a population-based sample of middle-aged women. Method A population-based sample of 11, 223 women aged 50 to 55, participating in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health, completed the Life Control Scale {{as part of an}} omnibus survey of health and psychosocial factors. Results The scale was demonstrated to be unifactorial and internally reliable and to show the expected relationships with several measures of socioeconomic position, physical health, and mental health. Conclusion The Life Control Scale is brief, valid, and broadly applicable in epidemiological research...|$|R
