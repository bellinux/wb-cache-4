Morgan and Ellis (2006) state {{that he lived}} with his family for the remainder of his life, while Cavalcanti (2004) and Bagot (2007) claim that there were problems and that he ended <b>up</b> <b>living</b> apart from his family.

5|$|Country Bill's Restaurant {{opened in}} 1964 after Ron Thomas' family {{purchased}} the business from Bill Blake for $600. Blake had named his lounge Country Bill's in 1960 but {{the business was}} unsuccessful. Thomas {{had been in the}} food service industry in Utah previously and ended <b>up</b> <b>living</b> in Portland after a series of relocations with his family. Though he was not fond of the lounge's name, Thomas was unable to afford new signage and kept the title. Over time the restaurant grew from a hamburger stand into a family dining restaurant, expanding east from one space to four. In 1978, the family purchased the building and property following the death of their landlord.|$|E

5|$|The owner at {{the time}} of the building's {{nomination}} to the National Register of Historic Places, Phil Becker, grew <b>up</b> <b>living</b> on Mazon Street (Illinois Route 17). He had been hanging out at the station since he was nine and began working at the station in 1964. One year after Becker's employment began, Ambler sold the station to Earl Kochler. Kochler sold the station to Royce McBeath, who ran it between 19651970. The station changed hands once again when Becker bought the station from McBeath on March 4, 1970. About a year after Becker took over operation of the station, Texaco suddenly stopped supplying the location with gasoline and Becker contracted with Marathon Oil. The brand change was accompanied by a name change to Becker's Marathon Gas Station, a name the station would be known by for over 26years. Becker operated the station, along with his wife Debbie, from the time of purchase until 1996. After closing the station, the couple leased the building out as an auto repair shop and eventually donated the building to the village of Dwight.|$|E
5|$|With Belldandy and Keiichi now {{portrayed as}} a couple, Fujishima {{introduces}} other factors: specifically the complications caused by family and friends. Forced to leave his dorm, as women {{are not permitted to}} stay on the premises, Keiichi and Belldandy end <b>up</b> <b>living</b> at the Tariki Hongan Temple in the city of Nekomi, Chiba Prefecture near Tokyo. Within both the manga and the anime, the temple was turned over to them by its former guardian, Koshian, a Buddhist monk who was overwhelmed by the purity of Belldandy's spirit and her unparalleled skills in polishing the temple altar, in cooking, and in Zazen meditation. Koshian departs the series by leaving for a pilgrimage to find spiritual perfection, (although he does briefly return later in the series), turning over the temple to Belldandy and Keiichi's care without realizing Belldandy's true nature as a Goddess. Later, Fujishima has Belldandy's two sisters (Urd and Skuld) join Belldandy and Keiichi in the temple. The story then follows the numerous misadventures of the not-so normal household, their growth {{over the course of the}} series and the budding romance between an ordinary young man and an angelic goddess.|$|E
5|$|While {{active as}} a runner, Nurmi {{was known to}} be secretive about his {{training}} methods. Always running alone, he upped his pace and quickly exhausted anyone who was bold enough to join him. Even his club mate Harri Larva had learned little from him. After ending his career, Nurmi became a coach for the Finnish Athletics Federation and trained runners for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. In 1935, Nurmi along with the entire board of directors quit the federation after a heated 40–38 vote to resume athletic relations with Sweden. However, Nurmi returned to coaching three months later and the Finnish distance runners went on to take three gold medals, three silvers and a bronze at the Games. In 1936, Nurmi also opened a men's clothing store (haberdashery) in Helsinki. It became a popular tourist attraction, and Emil Zátopek was among those who visited the store trying to meet Nurmi. The Finn spent his time in the back room, running another new business venture; construction. As a contractor, Nurmi built forty apartment buildings in Helsinki with about a hundred flats in each. Within five years, he was rated a millionaire. His fiercest rival Ritola ended <b>up</b> <b>living</b> in one of Nurmi's flats, at half price. Nurmi also made money on the stock market, eventually becoming one of Finland's richest people.|$|E
