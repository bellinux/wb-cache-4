40|$|HEINEKEN Nederland Supply {{continuously}} {{strives to}} improve its logistical processes {{in order to be}} able to serve its customer better, but at the same time to reduce costs. Within the Zoeterwoude Brewery, the Customer Service & Logistics department is responsible for the supply of the materials to the <b>packaging</b> <b>lines,</b> but also for the loading process of the pallets arriving at the warehouse. Increasing output from the <b>packaging</b> <b>lines</b> have caused regular spill-back of finished goods towards <b>packaging</b> <b>line</b> 2, 4 and 7. This spill-back causes standstill of the filling machine and therefore a drop in the performance of the <b>packaging</b> <b>lines.</b> HEINEKEN Nederland Supply has a large number of open sales orders and is already producing in over-time. This means that every lost production hour leads to sales losses for the company and the potential loss of valuable customers. The objective is to improve the loading process such that the capacities and planning are better aligned with the supply of the <b>packaging</b> <b>lines.</b> This leads to the following research question: How can the loading process at the Zoeterwoude Brewery of Heineken Nederland Supply be improved such that the capacities within the process and the corresponding planning are better aligned with the supply of <b>packaging</b> <b>line</b> 2, 4 and 7 ? This research is framed within the DMAIC methodology (and performed by following on the Theory of Constraints). This research starts by analysing the current loading process and influencing factors. It is found that the amount of pallets that is being processed by CS&L is growing at a fast rate. Especially the loose-loaded pallets are leading to an increase in pallets. The share of these pallets grew in total from 6...|$|R

One of the major machine efficiency losses detected within the production process is caused by product changeovers on the <b>packaging</b> <b>lines.</b> Multiple <b>packaging</b> <b>lines</b> are changed over with respect to product recipes, packaging materials and product types. The research conducted is {{focused on the}} reduction of product changeover inefficiencies regarding product losses and machine capacity losses on the <b>packaging</b> <b>lines.</b> A theoretical analysis of setup time reduction techniques, project organization theories and company specific characteristics led into a customized project design which is used for the reduction of product changeover inefficiencies. The product changeover improvement project developed is structured in 7 project steps in which the setups are analyzed on the product losses and machine capacity losses, the setup procedures are redesigned, machine modifications are made and off course the improvements developed are implemented. The product changeover improvement project is carried out with a project team and resulted into good improvements in the product changeovers on the <b>packaging</b> <b>line</b> producing coffee cups.

40|$|Retrovirus vectors {{can be made}} in {{the absence}} of helper virus by using {{retrovirus}} <b>packaging</b> cell <b>lines.</b> Helper-free virus is critical for a variety of gene transfer studies. The most useful <b>packaging</b> cell <b>lines</b> contain helper virus DNA from which the signal required for packaging of the viral RNA genome into virions has been deleted. However, we showed that the ability to package virus is conferred at very low frequency to cells infected with virus from these <b>packaging</b> cell <b>lines,</b> presumably by low-frequency transmission of the deleted virus genome. In addition, these <b>packaging</b> cell <b>lines</b> can interact with some retroviral vectors to yield replication-competent virus. We constructed <b>packaging</b> cell <b>lines</b> containing helper virus DNA that had several alterations in addition to deletion of the packaging signal. The new packaging cells retained the useful features of previously available lines but did not yield helper virus after introduction of any of the vectors tested, and transfer of the packaging function was not detected...|$|R
