5000|$|Pneumatic {{collection}} trucks have a crane with a {{tube and}} a mouthpiece that fits in a hole, usually hidden under a plate under the street.

50|$|These devices, {{since they}} work on {{atmospheric}} principles, cannot be installed in an enclosure containing air contaminants. Those contaminants could be drawn into the device, thus fouling the pipes. AVBs must be installed a minimum of 6 inches above the highest usage point in the system (i.e. sprinkler, drip emitter, etc.) <b>Underground</b> <b>installation</b> of AVBs is entirely ineffectual in providing backflow protection as groundwater in the underground vault could be drawn into the water system, contaminating it.|$|E

50|$|In 1984, the North Carolina General Assembly {{established}} Duck as a North Carolina Beautification District. As such, an {{ad valorem}} tax could be levied to beautify the district and/or protect its citizens. Initially, a tax was levied {{for the purpose of}} providing for the <b>underground</b> <b>installation</b> of power lines throughout the community. This action prevented the power company from installing 30 ft concrete poles along Duck Road. The result was an uncluttered skyline, increased safety for evacuation from the area (no downed poles or wires), and maintaining household power through major storm periods.|$|E
50|$|The {{station has}} a ticket hall and 2 passenger-operated {{machines}} (or POMs). The larger POM, called a Multi Fare Machine (MFM) accepts UK Sterling notes, up to £20 and gives change of 10p, 50p, £1 and £2 coins. The smaller machine, {{known as an}} Advance Fare Machine (AFM), does not give change and accepts overpayment up to 30p.

These machines are the standard London <b>Underground</b> <b>installation</b> at all LU operated stations.|$|E
5000|$|One {{limitation}} of the detector's design is its small size; due to the limited amount of surplus lead available, half of the neutrons generated escape before hitting a neutron detector. To mitigate this, it {{is surrounded by a}} layer of water to reflect some of the neutrons back in. Budget permitting, there are plans for a larger detector using 1000 t of lead and the remaining leftover 3He detectors (Due to lead's high density; 1000 t is a cube 4.45 m on a side, not an impractical size for <b>underground</b> <b>installation.)</b> ...|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} to the Liège fortifications, where seven of the Brialmont forts {{and all of the}} PFL forts may be visited, only one of the Namur forts is open to the public, Fort de St Heribert: it was buried during many years but since 2013, it is being excavated and restored and visited the fourth Sunday of each month from April to October. All are on private or military property. Malonne is closed as a refuge for bats.In the context of the World War I commemorative program, a project was introduced by the Namur local authorities to allow public access to Fort d'Emines (which will remain privately owned). Although the <b>underground</b> <b>installation</b> is considered unsafe by security services, counterscarp facilities and outdoor spaces will be cleared and signage will be added.|$|E

[...] The piece took over 10 years to complete. The New York Times notes, [...] "Mr. Otterness worked hard to find creative ways to place his sculpture, navigating around the rules of stations design." [...] Examples of figures in the subway installation include a woman toting a nearly lifesize subway token under her arm; a well-dressed fare jumper crawling under a metal gate; a homeless woman being rousted by the police; two figures holding a cross-cut saw, about to cut into an I-beam that holds up a stairway.|$|E
50|$|As the Allied air {{offensive}} against Nazi Germany intensified after 1943, the Nazi leadership decided to construct <b>underground</b> <b>installations</b> {{in order to}} produce weaponry and related war material. Accelerated construction of such facilities required significant outlay of human resources. The SS provided concentration camp prisoners to carry out the most dangerous tasks, such as hollowing out tunnels from mountainsides and caves, constructing subterranean factories, and hauling construction materials. To facilitate these immense projects, it set up hundreds of satellite camps close to proposed industrial sites in 1944 and 1945.|$|R

Had it been completed, it would have linked the formidable <b>underground</b> <b>installations</b> in the northern portion of Iwo Jima with {{the southern part of the}} island, where the northern slope of Mount Suribachi alone harbored several thousand yards of tunnels.

50|$|The SWCC clock's {{were usually}} used in {{synchronized}} time systems. Time systems {{that consisted of}} many clocks linked electrically to a master clock. The majority of the systems were installed in businesses, factories, banks, schools, and universities. Many railroads also relied on SWCC synchronized clock systems. Some clocks were sold as individual timepieces but most clocks {{were a part of}} time systems. SWCC offered many very elegant designs for their clocks and the clocks could be purchased to match any decor. These were essentially catalog items. There were however many special one-of-a-kind clocks and clock systems that were installed by SWCC. These were intended to be very important architectural statements. Two of the most significant installations were the clocks in the Grand Central Terminal and the enormous four-dial clock and lighting system for the Metropolitan Life Insurance building. The two pictured clocks of the Grand Central Terminal and the outside clocks on the Metropolitan Life Insurance building were just part of each property's very complex synchronized time systems. Grand Central Terminal had a master clock that controlled all the clocks at the terminal. Metropolitan Life had two separate master clocks. One controlled the motors for the four outside clocks, rang the bells in the bell tower and controlled the spectacular and very complex outside lighting system. Another SWCC master clock controlled 184 slave clocks throughout the original building. Complex SWCC synchronized systems were also installed in the London Underground. The <b>underground</b> <b>installation</b> started in 1905 and eventually included about 600 SWCC clocks.|$|E
50|$|Players {{assume the}} role of Mr. Diaz, a {{synthetic}} human hybrid created by aliens. In the game's introduction, he turns on his masters when he kills a synthetic human intended to replace the President's bodyguard, Johnny Slater. Diaz finds himself in a massive <b>underground</b> <b>installation</b> created by the aliens under Manhattan. As the game progresses, it is revealed that the player is actually assuming the role of Slater, who was disguised as Diaz by the Gargatuans. The Gargatuans are an alien race around three feet tall who, after being betrayed by a member of their species who awoke from hypersleep and piloted the ship to Earth, are forced to help said traitor with his genetic experiments. The alien creates clones and hybrids (a genetic mix of human and Gargatuan DNA, resulting in extra-powerful creatures) and intends to conquer the earth through a replacement of its leaders, beginning with the United States. A few Gargatuans have escaped the traitor, and conduct an underground resistance in the woodwork. They found Johnny after he had been cloned and disguised him as Diaz, who they incapacitated and kept unconscious. Johnny regains his memories, which were blocked while he was disguised. The player then must travel even further down the bunker in the hopes of stopping the aliens from replacing the president with a clone and by request of the Gargatuans to defeat the traitor. Johnny's personal motive to help him stay focused is that he must make it back in time to meet his girlfriend under the Christmas tree on the White House lawn.|$|E
