40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} focused on {{waterjet}} technology, dimensional and shape accuracy of manufactured parts. In the theoretical section, the principle of technlogy and its use in engineering industry at the present time, are described. Moreover, the theoretical section includes discription of every single parts of the machine of waterjet cutting, that are nowadays used. The biggest part of diploma thesis focuses on 3 D cutting technology and on attachments for elimination of <b>undercutting.</b> Practical <b>section</b> focuses on dimensional and shape accuracy of manufactured parts manufactured by waterjet technology that makes use of 3 D head and different cutting speed. The practical section also includes operating and maintenance cost of the machine. In terms of maintenance, real service life of components is compared there with a lifespan declarated by machine producer...|$|R
40|$|The process {{consisting}} of Selective Laser Sintering and posttreatment is an efficient and successful technique for the fast and direct prodn. of complex-shaped ceramic prototypes. Parts with complicated interior structures, filigree <b>sections,</b> <b>undercuts</b> and free-form surface areas can be produced. Coupling of material-oriented and tech. process modules has enabled the laser-sintering technol. to become viable for industrial application using ceramic powders such as silicon carbide. This paper presents the optimized sintering and infiltration {{steps of the}} manufg. process. Properties of laser-sintered parts made of SiSiC are discussed in comparison with those made using traditional sintering techniques. In conclusion recommendations for the practical use of the technique are given...|$|R
