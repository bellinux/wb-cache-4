25|$|A {{variety of}} lab {{techniques}} {{are used to}} determine the properties of polymers. Techniques such as wide angle X-ray scattering, small angle X-ray scattering, and small angle neutron scattering are {{used to determine the}} crystalline structure of polymers. Gel permeation chromatography is used to determine the number average molecular weight, weight average molecular weight, and polydispersity. FTIR, Raman and NMR can be used to determine composition. Thermal properties such as the glass transition temperature and melting point can be determined by differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis. Pyrolysis followed by analysis of the fragments is one more technique for determining the possible structure of the polymer. Thermogravimetry is a useful technique to evaluate the thermal stability of the polymer. Detailed analysis of TG curves also allow <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> a bit of the phase segregation in polymers. Rheological properties are also commonly used to help determine molecular architecture (molecular weight, molecular weight distribution and branching) as well as to understand how the polymer will process, through measurements of the polymer in the melt phase. Another polymer characterization technique is Automatic Continuous Online Monitoring of Polymerization Reactions (ACOMP) which provides real-time characterization of polymerization reactions. It can be used as an analytical method in R, as a tool for reaction optimization at the bench and pilot plant level and, eventually, for feedback control of full-scale reactors. ACOMP measures in a model-independent fashion the evolution of average molar mass and intrinsic viscosity, monomer conversion kinetics and, in the case of copolymers, also the average composition drift and distribution. It is applicable in the areas of free radical and controlled radical homo- and copolymerization, polyelectrolyte synthesis, heterogeneous phase reactions, including emulsion polymerization, adaptation to batch and continuous reactors, and modifications of polymers.|$|E

500|$|The intro, [...] "The Genesis", is {{composed}} as an aural montage {{that begins with}} the sound of an elevated train and an almost-inaudible voice rhyming beneath it. Over these sounds, a snatch of dialogue, two men arguing. It samples Grand Wizard Theodore's [...] "Subway Theme" [...] from the 1983 film Wild Style, the first major hip hop motion picture. Nas made another ode to Wild Style, while shooting the music video for his single, [...] "It Ain't Hard to Tell", on the same stage as the finale scene for the film. His verse on [...] "Live at the Barbeque" [...] is played in the background of [...] "The Genesis". According to music writer Mickey Hess, in the intro, [...] "Nas tells us everything he wants <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about him. The train is shorthand for New York; the barely discernible rap is, in fact, his [...] "Live at the Barbeque" [...] verse; and the dialogue comes from Wild Style, one of the earliest movies to focus on hip hop culture. Each of these is a point of genesis. New York for Nas as a person, 'Live at the Barbeque' for Nas the rapper, and Wild Style, symbolically at least, for hip hop itself. These are my roots, Nas was saying, and he proceeded to demonstrate exactly what those roots had yielded." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the views of John Calvin and Philipp Melanchthon, throughout his life Luther maintained {{that it was not}} false doctrine to believe that a Christian's soul sleeps after it is separated from the body in death. Accordingly, he disputed traditional interpretations of some Bible passages, such as the parable of the rich man and Lazarus. This also led Luther to reject the idea of torments for the saints: [...] "It is enough for <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that souls do not leave their bodies to be threatened by the torments and punishments of hell, but enter a prepared bedchamber in which they sleep in peace." [...] He also rejected the existence of Purgatory, which involved Christian souls undergoing penitential suffering after death. He affirmed the continuity of one's personal identity beyond death. In his Smalcald Articles, he described the saints as currently residing [...] "in their graves and in heaven." ...|$|E

2500|$|In this novel, {{published}} by Arbor House/William Morrow in 1988, a man dying of AIDS is {{taken in by}} his cousin, a rancher in the Colorado mountains. Award-winning author Nancy Kress writes [...] "Michael Bishop has pulled off a rare and amazing feat. [...] Unicorn Mountain successfully weaves such traditional fantasy elements as unicorns and Indian lore together with the all-too-contemporary..." [...] Orson Scott Card writes [...] "The triumph of this, Bishop's most artistically whole and successful novel to date, is that {{he set out to}} do something that is nearly impossible in fiction: He wrote a novel about constructing a tribe...To do it, he had to bring <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> and understand and care about more created characters than most writers produce in a career." [...] John Clute's assessment emphasizes another theme of the work: [...] "Michael Bishop, whose voice is like a shout {{from the bottom of the}} well of the enormous South, and whose heart is on his sleeve, [...] in Unicorn Mountain to generate a moving tale out of ecological disaster here and in another world, AIDS, the death of cultures, the death of species, and the slow sea-changing of America into themeparks." [...] The novel would go on to win the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award, and was shortlisted for the 1989 Locus Award.|$|E

2500|$|The texts {{attributed}} to the Apostolic Fathers, the earliest post-Biblical texts we have, share several key themes, particularly the call to unity {{in the face of}} internal divisions and perceptions of persecution, the reality of the charisms, especially prophecy, visions and Christian gnosis, which is understood as [...] "a gift of the Holy Spirit that enables <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> Christ" [...] through meditating on the scriptures and on the Cross of Christ. (This understanding of gnosis {{is not the same as}} that developed by the Gnostics, who focused on esoteric knowledge that is available only to a few people but that allows them to free themselves from the evil world.) These authors also discuss the notion of the [...] "two ways", that is, the way of life and the way of death; this idea has biblical roots, being found in both the Sermon on the Mount and the Torah. The two ways are then related to the notion of purity of heart, which is developed by contrasting it against the divided or duplicitous heart and by linking it to the need for asceticism, which keeps the heart whole/pure. Purity of heart was especially important given perceptions of martyrdom, which many writers discussed in theological terms, seeing it not as an evil but as an opportunity to truly die for the sake of God—the ultimate example of ascetic practice. Martyrdom could also be seen as symbolic in its connections with the Eucharist and with baptism.|$|E

The rear artwork of Jennifer Lopez's Rebirth drew comparisons to Jackson's Damita Jo album cover, depicting Lopez topless in a similar pose amidst a white backdrop.

2500|$|Fletch {{received}} generally positive {{reviews and}} has a 75% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 28 critics with the consensus: [...] "Quotably funny -- and fast-paced enough to smooth over the jokes that don't land -- Fletch {{is one of the}} best big-screen vehicles for Chevy Chase's brand of smug silliness". Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, [...] "The problem is, Chase's performance tends to reduce all the scenes to the same level, at least as far as he is concerned. He projects such an inflexible mask of cool detachment, of ironic running commentary, that we're prevented from identifying with him [...] [...] [...] Fletch needed an actor more interested in playing the character than in playing himself." [...] Vincent Canby in his review for The New York Times praised Chase's performance, writing, [...] "He manages simultaneously to act the material with a good deal of nonchalance and to float above it, as if he wanted <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that he knows that the whole enterprise is somewhat less than transcendental." [...] Time magazine's Richard Schickel wrote, [...] "In Fletch, the quick, smartly paced, gags somehow read as signs of vulnerability. Incidentally, they add greatly to the movie's suspense. Every minute you expect the hero's loose lip to be turned into a fat one." [...] In his review for the Chicago Reader, Dave Kehr wrote, [...] "Chase and Ritchie make a strong, natural combination: the union of their two flip, sarcastic personalities produces a fairly definitive example of the comic style of the 80s, grounded in detachment, underreaction, and cool contempt for rhetorically overblown authority figures." ...|$|E
