Diệm had scheduled an emergency cabinet meeting at 11:30 on 11 June to discuss the Buddhist crisis which he believed to be winding down. Following Đức's death, Diệm canceled the meeting and met individually with his ministers. Acting U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam William Trueheart warned Nguyễn Đình Thuận, Diệm's Secretary of State, of the desperate need for an agreement, saying that the situation was [...] "dangerously near breaking point" [...] and expected Diệm would meet the Buddhists' five-point manifesto. United States Secretary of State Dean Rusk warned the Saigon embassy that the White House would publicly announce that {{it would no longer}} [...] "associate itself" [...] with the regime if this did not occur.

"Mongrels friends, {{it is my}} unbearably sad duty to {{announce}} {{that we will not}} be returning for a third series on BBC Three, a decision that has been made {{based on the fact that}} apparently you need more than two people watching a programme to make it successful. Crazy talk. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone at BBC Comedy, BBC Three and BBC Worldwide who have supported us so strongly over the years, and helped <b>us</b> <b>put</b> our silly puppet show on the digital screens of the nation. I'd also like to thank, from the bottom of my heart, all the writers, cast, crew and support team who have made a horribly challenging show such an utter joy to make. This news could not be less of a reflection on your brilliant work. Most of all I'd like to thank those of you that loved watching Mongrels as much as we loved making it. It's wonderfully reassuring to think that we weren't mad after all, and that what we find funny, other people do too. I'd like to believe that there's room on television for a little show like ours; one that's not just another sitcom, one that tries to do things a bit differently and that tries to push a few boundaries here and there. Who knows, maybe we'll find a that room in the future. I hope it has a minibar. Thank you for watching. Both of you." ...|$|E

[...] Clarke replied that {{he was talking about}} bin Laden and his network because it posed [...] "an immediate and serious threat to the United States." [...] According to Clarke, Wolfowitz turned to him and said, [...] "You give bin Laden too much credit. He could not do all these things like the 1993 attack on New York, not without a state sponsor.

While EMP Pad Limited said it did not pay Edmonds to promote the product, the company's owner Maria Robertson, previously worked as an assistant to the TV presenter and acknowledged having known Edmonds for 25 years and having worked with him and his daughter. Cancer Research UK produced an article to reassure the public that [...] "the best studies looking at this topic have failed to show a link between emotional stress and an increased risk of cancer" [...] and that [...] "no reliable evidence has ever been produced that Rife machines – or any similar devices producing low-frequency electromagnetic pulses – have any benefit for cancer patients. Nor have organisations that scrutinise new treatments and devices (like the US Food and Drug Authority or the European Medicines Agency) approved any as a therapy for any type of disease". Dr David Grimes, a cancer researcher at Oxford University, told ‘This Morning’: [...] "It’s not just untrue, it’s patronising and victim blaming, cancer is bad luck... the healthiest people in the world get cancer and it’s not because they are negative". Prof. John Gribben, Chair of Medical Oncology at Queen Mary University of London, said: “This is complete gibberish and undermines all the good work everyone does with evidence-based medicine and targeted approaches". Prof. Edzard Ernst, Emeritus Professor at the University Of Exeter said “The reason why most of <b>us</b> <b>put</b> ‘negative energy’ in inverted commas is simple: it is a pure figment of the imagination of fantasists. That would not be so bad except that, as we see, some VIPs seem to take this nonsense seriously. The result might be that some desperate patients believe them, and choose the nonsense over the best that real medicine has to offer. And that could hasten deaths.” ...|$|E
