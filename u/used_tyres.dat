5|$|All but Daniel Ricciardo {{did their}} first run in Q3 on <b>used</b> <b>tyres</b> {{in order to}} save a set for the race, with Hamilton fastest yet again. When the cars came around for their second and final timed laps, Ricciardo crossed the line first ahead of the Ferrari drivers, with Vettel going faster than {{teammate}} Räikkönen. When the two Mercedes came across the line last, Hamilton took his fourth consecutive pole position, while Nico Rosberg had to settle for third on the grid, not being able to beat Vettel's time. The two Williams cars filled the third row, while Nico Hülkenberg was delighted with eighth on the grid.|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{pyrolysis}} process of <b>used</b> <b>tyre</b> {{as a method of}} producing an alternative energy source is presented in this paper. The study reports the characteristics of <b>used</b> <b>tyre</b> materials and methods of recycling, types and principles of pyrolysis, the pyrolysis products and their composition, effects of process parameters, and kinetic models applied to pyrolysis. From publications, the proximate analysis of tyre rubber shows that it is composed of about 28. 6 [*]wt. % fixed carbon, 62 [*]wt. % volatile material, 8. 5 [*]wt. % ash, and 0. 9 [*]wt. % moisture. Elemental analysis reveals that tyre rubber has an estimated value of 82 [*]wt. % of C, 8 [*]wt. % of H, 0. 4 [*]wt. % of N, 1. 3 [*]wt. % of S, 2. 4 [*]wt. % of O, and 5. 9 [*]wt. % of ash. Thermogravimetry analysis confirms that the pyrolysis of <b>used</b> <b>tyre</b> at atmospheric pressure commences at 250 °C and completes at 550 °C. The three primary products obtained from <b>used</b> <b>tyre</b> pyrolysis are solid residue (around 36 [*]wt. %), liquid fraction or biocrude (around 55 [*]wt. %), and gas fraction (around 9 [*]wt. %). Although there is variation in the value of kinetic parameters obtained by different authors from the kinetic modeling of <b>used</b> <b>tyre,</b> the process is generally accepted as a first order reaction based on Arrhenius theory...|$|R

500|$|Hill {{became the}} fourth driver {{in nine years}} to win the World Drivers' Championship for Williams and not drive for the team the {{following}} season, as occurred with Nelson Piquet ( [...] champion – [...] driver for Lotus), Nigel Mansell ( [...] champion – 1993 driver in the US-based Indy Car World Series instead of F1) and Alain Prost (1993 champion – retired in 1994). As world champion, Hill was in high demand and had offers for a race seat from McLaren, Benetton and Ferrari but not adequately financially valued despite his status. As a consequence, he opted to sign for Arrows, a team which had never won a race in its 20-year history and had scored only a single point the previous year. Hill's title defence in 1997 proved unsuccessful, getting off to a poor start when he only narrowly qualified for the Australian Grand Prix and then retired on the parade lap. The Arrows car, which <b>used</b> <b>tyres</b> from series debutant Bridgestone and previously unproven Yamaha engines, was generally uncompetitive, and Hill did not score his first point for the team until the British Grand Prix at Silverstone in July. His best result for the year then came at the Hungarian Grand Prix. On {{a day when the}} Bridgestone tyres had a competitive edge over their Goodyear rivals, Hill qualified third in a car that had not previously placed higher than 9th on the grid. During the race, he passed his rival and new championship contender, Michael Schumacher, on the track and was leading late in the race, 35 seconds ahead of the eventual 1997 World Champion, Villeneuve, until a hydraulic problem drastically slowed the Arrows. Villeneuve thus passed Hill, who finished second and achieved the team's first podium since the 1995 Australian Grand Prix. This new podium ultimately turned out to be Arrows' last ever podium finish.|$|E

Protesters chanted anti-Western slogans, slogans against Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon, waved placards and burned <b>used</b> <b>tyres</b> outside the United Nations (UN) office in Colombo. According to BBC correspondent in Sri Lanka Elmo Fernando, the demonstrators shouted slogans urging Ban Ki-moon to quit his post and [...] "go home" [...] and described the military intervention in Libya as war crimes. National Freedom Front (NFF) leader and MP Wimal Weerawansa (whose party organized the protest) said, [...] "We are against the biased behaviour of the UN on Libya in favour of the US and Britain. The people of Libya should decide how to resolve their own internal problems". Banners reading, [...] "We condemn killing innocent civilians in Libya" [...] and [...] "Banki Moon go to hell" [...] were seen in the demonstration. Protesters burned and beat US president Barack Obama in effigy. Some protesters described Barack Obama as a [...] "murderer".|$|E

40|$|Estimating vehicle {{sideslip}} {{is challenging}} {{as well as}} important for vehicle safety systems such as Electronic Stability Control. In this work, a Kalman filter is proposed to estimate vehicle sideslip <b>using</b> <b>tyre</b> force measurements. Most of the vehicle sideslip estimators do not <b>use</b> <b>tyre</b> force measurements and are based on tyre force model. Because of the tyre force model nonlinearities and uncertainties, the estimator accuracy depends highly on factors such as tyre-road friction, vertical load, temperature, tyre pressure, etc. Therefore availability of tyre force measurements offers benefits in vehicle sideslip estimation. The proposed estimator also has advantage over accelerometer based estimators as the later can have estimation errors from roll and pitch dynamics. The estimator is studied in a multi-body vehicle simulator for various maneuvers...|$|R
