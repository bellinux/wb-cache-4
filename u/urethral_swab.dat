40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the performances of}} a ligase chain reaction (LCR) -based assay and two enzyme immunoassays (Chlamydiazyme and IDEIA) in the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis in urine specimens. We compared the results of testing urine specimens by these assays with those of <b>urethral</b> <b>swab</b> culture by examining samples from 131 men with nongonococcal urethritis. Discrepant results were analyzed by testing <b>urethral</b> <b>swab</b> specimens for C. trachomatis by a PCR-based assay. After the resolution of discrepant results, the sensitivity of <b>urethral</b> <b>swab</b> culture was 85. 3 %, whereas those of the LCR assay, Chlamydiazyme, and IDEIA with urine specimens were 94. 1, 82. 4, and 94. 1 %, respectively. The LCR assay and IDEIA were more sensitive than was <b>urethral</b> <b>swab</b> culture. In addition, the LCR assay, with a sensitivity {{equal to that of}} IDEIA, was more specific.

40|$|Mycoplasma genitalium is a {{cause of}} nongonococcal urethritis, {{particularly}} in patients not infected with Chlamydia trachomatis. A quantitative 5 ′ nuclease assay (TaqMan PCR) was developed and validated. The assay detected a fragment of the MgPa adhesin gene by use of a TaqMan MGB (minor groove binder) probe and included an internal processing control to detect PCR inhibition. <b>Urethral</b> <b>swab</b> specimens and first-void urine samples from M. genitalium-positive men were examined, and the M. genitalium DNA load was correlated to symptoms and signs. The assay consistently detected < 5 genome copies without cross-reactions with other mycoplasmas.

40|$|<b>Urethral</b> <b>swabs</b> are {{the samples}} {{of choice for}} point-of-care Gram stain testing to {{diagnose}} Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection and nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) in men. As an alternative to <b>urethral</b> <b>swabs,</b> meatal swabs have been recommended for the collection of urethral discharge to diagnose N. gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis infection in certain populations by nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT), as they involve a less invasive collection method. However, as meatal swabs could be sampling a reduced surface area and result in fewer collected epithelial cells compared to <b>urethral</b> <b>swabs,</b> the adequacy of meatal swab specimens to collect sufficient cellular material for Gram stain testing remains unknown. We enrolled 66 men who underwent either <b>urethral</b> or meatal <b>swabbing</b> and compared the cellular content and Gram stain failure rate. We measured the difference in swab cellular content using the Cepheid Xpert CT/NG sample adequacy control crossing threshold (SACCT) and determined the failure rate of Gram stain smears (GSS) due to insufficient cellular material.

Urologists are certainly aware that Peyronie&# 39;s disease may occur after traumatic urethral instrumentation (catheterization, urethrocystoscopy, etc), but onset of Peyronie&# 39;s disease after <b>urethral</b> <b>swab</b> for diagnostic purposes has never {{been reported in the}} literature. This paper presents the case of a patient who developed Peyronie&# 39;s disease after a clumsy <b>urethral</b> <b>swab</b> insertion. It is an unusual, and to date unreported, complication which we would like to call attention to. In the case of our patient, the swab had been inserted to a greater depth than normally required and strong pressure had also been applied. During the procedure, the patient experienced severe urethral and penile pain, which was followed by urethrorrhagia, and later penile curvature. The patient was treated conservatively with good results, partly because the disease was still in its active stage and not yet stable. In the light of what we report, when ordering a <b>urethral</b> <b>swab,</b> physicians should always recommend that it be performed at testing centers that follow accurate, rigorous standards. Patients should also be informed that the test they are to undergo consists of a swab being inserted into the urethra for a short distance, not more than 2 – 3 cm.

The CHL assay is widely used in Europe, but U. S. experience with it is limited. Three clinical test sites (The Arlington Hospital, Arlington, Va., Indiana University, Indianapolis, and the University of California, San Francisco) compared CHL with tissue culture (TC) for the identification of chlamydia in urogenital specimens (2, 453 females and 850 males). True positives (TP) were defined as either TC positive or TC negative and CHL positive by a positive direct fluorescent-antibody assay or PCR test. Overall prevalence was 5. 5 % for females, 10. 3 % for male <b>urethral</b> <b>swabs,</b> and 10. 7 % for combined male TC <b>urethral</b> <b>swabs</b> and CHL with first catch urine (FCU) specimens. Compared to TP, CHL and TC had sensitivities of 89. 6 and 94. 1 % with female cervical swabs and 90. 9 and 86. 4 % with male <b>urethral</b> <b>swabs,</b> respectively.

40|$|Urine ligase chain {{reaction}} (LCR) and PCR tests and <b>urethral</b> <b>swab</b> culture were compared for {{their abilities to}} detect Chlamydia trachomatis infection in 3, 639 asymptomatic men by using one-, two-, and three-test reference standards. Frozen urine at four of five participating centers was also tested by a transcription-mediated amplification assay which {{was used as a}} reference test. LCR increased the yield of positive results by 27 % and PCR increased the yield of positive results by 26 % over the yield of positive results by culture (n = 295). LCR and PCR sensitivities were similar, ranging from 80. 4 to 93. 5 %, depending on the reference standard. Culture sensitivity was substantially less. A multiple-test standard yielded LCR, PCR, and culture specificities of 99. 6 %, with or without discrepant analysis. Test performance varied among centers partly due to different interpretations of the testing protocols. The study confirms that urine LCR and PCR for the detection of C. trachomatis have substantially improved sensitivities over that of <b>urethral</b> <b>swab</b> culture for testing of asymptomatic men, enabling screening of this important target group. These tests, perhaps in combination, are also candidate reference tests for the conduct of test evaluation studies...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} the groups at risk of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), we assessed the sociodemographic profiles of men testing for STD, their sexual habits, {{and the results of}} microbiological analysis. During a three-year period, a total of 700 men older than 18 years of age completed the questionnaire regarding sociodemographic and sexual behavior. <b>Urethral</b> <b>swabs</b> were taken for microbiological analysis. Thirty-three percent of respondents reported not using condoms. Those that do not use condoms were predominantly less educated, unmarried but in steady relationships, employed, with children, and smokers. Alcohol or drug usage before sexual intercourse was disclosed by 21. 4 % of respondents, and 10. 3 % respondents reported sexual intercourses with commercial sex workers. Finally, 24. 0 % respondents reported sexual relations abroad. In 28. 1 % of subjects, one or more pathogens were observed in <b>urethral</b> <b>swabs.</b> The most commonly diagnosed microorganism was Ureaplasma urealyticum, followed by Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma hominis, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. This study identified several factors that may contribute to the general risk of STD transmission, which will serve to better understand the transmission dynamics and implementation of adequate prevention programs.  </p...|$|R

40|$|The fully {{automated}} COBAS AMPLICOR CT/NG {{test for the}} detection of Chlamydia trachomatis was evaluated in a multicenter trial. Test performance was evaluated for 2, 014 endocervical swab and 1, 278 urine specimens obtained from women and for 373 <b>urethral</b> <b>swab</b> and 254 urine specimens obtained from men. Culture served as the reference test. Culture-negative, COBAS AMPLICOR-positive specimens that tested positive in a confirmatory PCR test for an alternative target sequence within the C. trachomatis major outer membrane protein gene were resolved as true positives. The overall prevalence of chlamydia was 4. 3 % in cervical swabs and 11. 0 % in urethral swabs from men. When the results for each specimen type were considered separately the resolved sensitivities were 96. 5 % (83 of 86) for endocervical swab specimens, 95. 1 % (39 of 41) for urine specimens from women, 100. 0 % (41 of 41) for <b>urethral</b> <b>swab</b> specimens from men, and 94. 4 % (17 of 18) for urine specimens from men; the resolved specificities were 99. 4 % (1, 912 of 1, 924) for endocervical swab specimens, 99. 8 % (1, 204 of 1, 207) for urine specimens from women, 98. 5 % (325 of 330) for <b>urethral</b> <b>swab</b> specimens from men, and 100. 0 % (236 of 236) for urine specimens from men. For the subset of patients from whom both swab and urine specimens were collected, the combined results for both specimen types were used to identify all infected patients. Using these combined results as criteria, the resolved sensitivities for the COBAS AMPLICOR test were 82. 6 % (38 of 46) for endocervical swab specimens, 84. 4 % (38 of 45) for urine specimens from women, 84. 2 % (16 of 19) for <b>urethral</b> <b>swab</b> specimens from men, and 89. 5 % (17 of 19) for urine specimens from men. In comparison, the sensitivity of culture was only 56. 5 % (26 of 46) for endocervical specimens and 63. 2 % (12 of 19) for urethral specimens from men. The internal control provided in the COBAS AMPLICOR test revealed that 2. 9 % of specimens were inhibitory when they were initially tested. Nevertheless, valid results were obtained for 99. 1 % of specimens because 68. 7 % of the inhibitory specimens were not inhibitory when a second aliquot of the original sample was tested. Two additional COBAS AMPLICOR-positive specimens were detected by retesting inhibitory specimens. The COBAS AMPLICOR CT/NG test {{for the detection of}} C. trachomatis exhibited equally high sensitivities and specificities with both urogenital swab and urine specimens and, thus, is well-suited for use in screening...|$|E
40|$|The Gen-Probe AMPLIFIED Chlamydia Trachomatis Assay (AMP CT) uses transcription-mediated {{amplification}} and hybridization protection assay {{procedures to}} qualitatively detect Chlamydia trachomatis rRNA in urine, endocervical swab, and urethral specimens. The {{performance of the}} AMP CT was {{compared to that of}} cell culture for endocervical swab and urine specimens from women and urethral and urine specimens from men. Analysis of specimens with discrepant results was performed by a combination of reculture, direct fluorescent-antibody (DFA) staining of specimen sediment, and amplification which targeted a different chlamydial rRNA. A total of 800 urine samples were tested by the AMP CT (607 from women and 193 from men), and 7. 1 % were positive for C. trachomatis, with a sensitivity of 91. 2 % and a specificity of 99. 6 % upon discrepant analysis. A total of 926 swab specimens were tested by culture and AMP CT (717 endocervical swab specimens and 209 <b>urethral</b> <b>swab</b> specimens from men), and 7. 7 % were positive for C. trachomatis, with a sensitivity and specificity of 100 % upon discrepant analysis. The AMP CT is a sensitive and specific nucleic acid hybridization assay for the detection of C. trachomatis in endocervical swab specimens from women, <b>urethral</b> <b>swab</b> specimens from men, and urine specimens from men and women...|$|E

40|$|In {{addition}} to the urogenital tract, Neisseria gonorrhoeae infects extragenital sites such as the pharynx and anorectal canal. Culture and a ligase chain reaction (LCR) -based assay were compared for their performance for the diagnosis of N. gonorrhoeae infection with specimens from various urogenital and extragenital sites of 200 men and 125 women. The sensitivity and specificity of the LCR assay with male <b>urethral</b> <b>swabs</b> were both 100 %, compared to values of 95. 9 and 100 %, respectively, for culture of <b>urethral</b> <b>swabs</b> or 98. 0 and 100 %, respectively, for LCR with first-void urine (FVU). For women, LCR with FVU showed the highest sensitivity (94. 7 %), and culture of urethral samples showed the lowest sensitivity (63. 2 %) (P < 0. 05). In a selected subgroup of 47 men and 22 women at increased risk, the rates of pharyngeal infection were 15 and 18 %, respectively, and those of anorectal infection were 13 and 45 %, respectively. The sensitivity of LCR was {{greater than that of}} culture for both pharyngeal and anorectal specimens. Thus, the overall performance of LCR testing with swabs or FVU was better than that of culture for the diagnosis of genital or extragenital gonorrhea...|$|R
40|$|Variations in {{estimates}} of prevalence of trichomoniasis in men may reflect true {{differences in the}} burden of disease but are also affected by the performance of diagnostic methods {{and the type of}} specimen tested. In this study, men were evaluated at baseline and at follow-up, to evaluate syndromic management of urethritis and the effects of human immunodeficiency virus and trichomoniasis, in Lilongwe, Malawi. First-void urine specimens and <b>urethral</b> <b>swabs</b> were obtained at enrollment, for Trichomonas vaginalis culture; semen specimens were also obtained at follow-up. The sensitivities of testing methods using urine specimens and <b>urethral</b> <b>swabs</b> were equal; 67 % of cases were identified by use of either specimen, and, in 47 % of cases, both specimens tested positive. When semen specimens were included, all 3 specimens tested positive in only 19 % of cases. Semen was the most sensitive single specimen, and, in 25. 6 % of cases, only semen specimens tested positive. Thus, prevalence of T. vaginalis infection in men is underestimated if only 1 specimen is tested. Although Trichomonas vaginalis infection is a recog-nized cause of morbidity in women, trichomoniasis in men is not as well understood. In men, trichomoniasis is associated with urethritis [1 – 5] and prostatitis [5 – 7]. In addition, infection with T. vaginalis may increas...|$|R
