In Bergen cars can only enter the central area using a toll road, so that the effect {{is similar to a}} congestion charge. Though initially intended only to raise revenues to finance road infrastructure, the <b>urban</b> <b>toll</b> ring at Oslo created an unintended congestion pricing effect, as traffic decreased by around 5%. The Trondheim Toll Scheme also has congestion pricing effects, as charges vary by time of day. The Norwegian authorities pursued authorization to implement congestion charges in cities, and legislation was approved by Parliament in 2001. In October 2011 the Norwegian government announced the introduction of rules allowing congestion charging in cities. The measure is intended to [...] cut greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions, and relief traffic congestion. , Norwegian authorities have implemented urban charging schemes that operates both on the motorways and for access into downtown areas in five additional cities or municipalities: Haugesund, Kristiansand, Namsos, Stavanger, and Tonsberg.|$|E

30|$|Our {{objective}} {{in this paper}} is to study how the political intention of individuals, identified on the basis of general attitudes to the principles of regulation and pricing, influences or does not influence their attitudes to <b>urban</b> <b>tolls?</b> Attitude {{is only one of the}} determinants of intention (with subjective norms and control perception and intention acts on behaviour [4]. To answer this previous question, we study the link between general attitudes to regulation and pricing and the vote of a referendum on <b>urban</b> <b>tolls.</b> We use the results of a survey performed in France in May 2011 (N[*]~[*] 1 500) in the framework of the ExpAcc project [61]. 1 First, we use standard OLS estimation to obtain an overview of the relation between referendum and socio-economics variables.

50|$|The {{section of}} the N17 from Johannesburg to Springs is a dual {{carriageway}} and is a national toll route. It was the first <b>urban</b> <b>toll</b> road in Gauteng.

As part of the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Scheme, two slip roads have been made linking the N17 to the N12. It is now possible to travel from the N17 West to the N12 West and from the N12 East to the N17 East, both at the Elands Interchange (previously only possible via the N3). From Tonk Meter Road the N17 is a single carriageway freeway. The section from Springs to Leandra, ending at the interchange with the R50, was constructed by the then Transvaal Provincial Administration (TPA) in 1990 as a single carriageway road. (The R29 ran alongside the N17 from Springs to Leandra).|$|E
30|$|Another {{part of the}} {{literature}} shows voting on <b>urban</b> <b>toll</b> can be determined by self-interest [3, 5, 54, 55].

The amount of money to be paid has a negative influence on the attitude toward the system while <b>urban</b> <b>toll</b> green image has a positive one.|$|E
30|$|In {{the case}} of Stockholm, Eliasson and Mattsson [14] showed that car drivers who lived outside the {{conurbation}} and those {{who lived in the}} center would be affected by the introduction of the toll. Emmerink et al. [15] had already demonstrated that <b>urban</b> <b>tolls</b> increase the cost of residences located outside and at the periphery of conurbation and, for certain categories of income, they limit this choice of location beyond the periphery. The impact of the toll is greater for both with low income and weak capacity to adapt. This capacity is further reduced if they travel for work.|$|R
30|$|Regarding the {{question}} {{specific to the}} referendum, we first showed {{that it would be}} rejected by electors. We can moderate this point by the specific quotas we take for two variables, but the unbalance in favor of rejection is validated. This result is in line with that of Jaensirisak et al. [28] and also with what occurred in Stockholm {{at the end of the}} trail [13]. Our results highlight a significant link between the attitudes to control by legislation or by taxes and transport pricing on the one hand, and the attitude to a referendum on <b>urban</b> <b>tolls</b> on the other.|$|R
30|$|Eliasson and Jonsson [12] {{show the}} impact of the {{environmental}} concerns as a determinant of attitudes towards congestion pricing in Stockholm. The green self-image of the measure motivates a vote in favor of the scheme. Jaensirisak et al. [29] found also that an ability to achieve substantial environmental improvements was more important for acceptability than the scheme’s perceived ability to deliver concerning congestion relief. Earmarking toll revenues to public transport is also an argument for the <b>urban</b> <b>tolls</b> [3, 39]. The number of electors against the measure fell considerably when the toll revenues were assigned to public transport [9].|$|R
