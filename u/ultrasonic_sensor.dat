25|$|A {{method of}} {{external}} (noninvasive) fetal monitoring (EFM) during childbirth is cardiotocography, using a cardiotocograph {{that consists of}} two sensors: The heart (cardio) sensor is an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>sensor,</b> similar to a Doppler fetal monitor, that continuously emits ultrasound and detects motion of the fetal heart by the characteristic of the reflected sound. The pressure-sensitive contraction transducer, called a tocodynamometer (toco) has a flat area that is fixated to the skin by a band around the belly. The pressure required to flatten {{a section of the}} wall correlates with the internal pressure, thereby providing an estimate of contraction.|$|E
