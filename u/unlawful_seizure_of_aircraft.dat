The convention only addresses situations in which an aircraft takes off or lands in a place different from its country of registration.

40|$|The Border Patrol {{says it has}} a “three-tiered, defense-in-depth strategy” {{to secure}} the border between ports of entry {{involving}} “the use of line-watch operations on the border, roving patrol operations near the border, and traffic checkpoints on highways leading away from the border. ” At the border. Near the border. Leading away from the border. As it does here, the eponymous agency generally defends its sphere of activities as involving or being {{in relation to the}} actual border. The problem is that the Border Patrol is actually engaged in roving patrol operations at a greater distance from the border than its own regulations appear to contemplate. More to the point, its modus operandi often appears to be to conduct these operations in a manner that clearly violates not only its own operating regulations but also applicable statutory law and constitutional limitations. The predictable result is a degraded agency, racial profiling, and <b>unlawful</b> <b>seizures</b> <b>of</b> the undocumented, of non-citizens with legal status, and of U. S. citizens. The principle underlying reason for this abuse of power (beyond our imperfect human nature) is uncomplicated—the Border Patrol is insufficiently restrained. There are neither adequate internal nor sufficient external restraints on the exercise of its powers. It has been left to self-regulate and this experiment has been a failure, but a failure that largely goes unnoticed because of the legal and factual context in which the Border Patrol operates...|$|R
5000|$|In real-life use, {{the phrase}} [...] "air piracy" [...] more often {{refers to the}} {{hijacking}} and illegal <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> an <b>aircraft.</b> However, there has been at least one occasion of an act of nautical-type piracy being conducted from the air.

5000|$|... :... The {{gravity of}} the crime of {{hijacking}} is obvious; it is universally condemned and punished severely. Although {{there is no evidence of}} the particular circumstances of this offence, hijacking is an offence that is always very serious. Section 76 of the Criminal Code makes it an offence punishable by life imprisonment. Canada has ratified international treaties, such as the Convention for the Suppression of <b>Unlawful</b> <b>Seizure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aircraft,</b> signed at The Hague on 16 December 1970, 860 U.N.T.S. 105, and the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation, concluded at Montréal on 23 September 1971, 974 U.N.T.S. 178, which recognise that hijacking aircraft jeopardises the safety of persons and property, seriously affects the operation of air services, and undermines the confidence of the peoples of the world in the safety of civil aviation. These international instruments do no require Canada to deny entry to any person convicted of hijacking, but strongly emphasise the serious nature of the crime and encourage signatories to severely punish hijacking, take actions to discourage it, and generally co-operate 227 in the international condemnation of this crime. It is clear that hijacking is considered to be among the most serious of criminal offences. Hijacking may combine, in one act, numerous offences including kidnapping, unlawful confinement, theft, assault, extortion, and potentially murder. It entails the violation of individual human rights such as the right to life, personal security and freedom of movement. It financially damages airlines, associated industries and the economy as a whole. ...|$|E
40|$|Following the September 11 {{terrorist}} attacks in America and the occurrence of other new and emerging threats to civil aviation, {{the international community has}} been faced with the harsh reality in the field of aviation security, hence, several legal attempts were made to address such aviation threats. Consequently, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in its 37 th Diplomatic Conference of 2010 held in Beijing, China, adopted two new international legal instruments namely; Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Relating to International Civil Aviation (Beijing Convention of 2010) and Protocol Supplementary to the Convention for Suppression of <b>Unlawful</b> <b>Seizure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aircraft</b> (Beijing Protocol of 2010). This study reviews the historical background to the development of international air law on aviation security and further assesses and analyzes in detail the provisions of the Beijing legal instruments in comparison with the previous treaties. Finally, the key {{question of whether or not}} the new Beijing Convention and the Protocol are adequate and effective in combating threats to aviation security is addressed through doctrinal research. In this regard, information was collected from various primary and secondary sources of law including books, articles, conventions, protocols, statutes and internets. Further information was gathered from various aviation stakeholders including aviation experts, security staff, lawyers, passengers, ground handlers, crews, regulators, airline and airport operators. From the information collected, the study comes up with conclusion, observations and recommendations which may be useful in addressing new and emerging threats to aviation security. ...|$|E
40|$|Unlawful {{interference}} with civil aviation {{has become a}} major concern for the world aviation community. The misuse of aircraft as {{a weapon of mass destruction}} has created new challenges. Air terrorism has moved from hijacking or <b>unlawful</b> <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> to an in-flight explosion caused by sabotage and finally to September 11, 2001, to the use of a civil airplane as a weapon of destruction. The events of September may be the biggest security challenge ever faced by the aviation industry. The impact of this tragic event on the global economy has been very harsh. The events have tended to obscure the fact that civil aviation continues to be an inherent safe mode of transport. Great efforts are being made at the national and international levels to create a security net which is global in nature and so tight that not one further potential act of unlawful interference can slip through. However, the fact remains that, in weaving the net and designing measures with the objectives of preventing, combating and eradicating acts of terrorism involving civil aviation, it is prudent to be imaginative in assessing the threat, which could come from new directions and in new forms. This thesis explores the implications of the 11 September 2001 events. A global strategy is initiated by ICAO and endorsed by the States, with the aim of protecting lives, restoring public confidence in air travel, and promoting the financial health of air transport. I will therefore examine the measures initiated by ICAO in response to the new challenges in aviation and which form the basis of the aviation security action plan. The perspective is that the events of 11 September have changed the world, and changed irrecoverably. Nothing will be the same for the aviation industry...|$|E

50|$|Writing {{after the}} war, General Holland Smith, {{who in his}} {{biography}} was {{highly critical of the}} Navy, commented: Was Tarawa worth it? My answer is unqualified: No. From the very beginning the decision of the Joint Chiefs to seize Tarawa was a mistake and from their initial mistake grew the terrible drama of errors, errors of omission rather than commission, resulting in these needless casualties. Some commanders involved, including Admiral Chester Nimitz, Admiral Raymond Spruance, Lt General Julian C. Smith and Lt Colonel David Shoup, disagreed with General Smith. Said Nimitz: The capture of Tarawa knocked down the front door to the Japanese defenses in the Central Pacific. Nimitz launched the Marshalls campaign 10 weeks after the <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> Tarawa. <b>Aircraft</b> flown from airfields at Betio and Apamama proved highly valuable, but the greater significance of the action on Tarawa to the success in the Marshalls proved to be the lessons learned from the battle itself.|$|R

The fact remains, however, that even the most stringent security requirements have not been able to guard against all possible attacks. This thesis explores the private law liability issues that may arise from branches of the duty to secure airports and aircraft. The focus is on providing a global view of the principles governing suits against the two most likely defendants [...] the air carrier and the government [...] and on the policy options which could underpin civil liability.
