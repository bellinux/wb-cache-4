25|$|The report {{concluded}} that the crash was a Controlled Flight into Terrain accident, in which aircrew failed to display superior judgment and professional skills in a self-created unsafe environment. In their pursuit to land in inclement weather, they committed serious violations of procedures and breaches of flying discipline, which put the aircraft in an <b>unsafe</b> <b>condition</b> over dangerous terrain at low altitude.|$|E
25|$|After the {{disengagement}} of the autopilot, {{there was}} no control activity of the aircraft wheel for six seconds and the column activity for eight seconds. Captain Noor and First Officer Javid were both in state of confusion and unsure of remedial {{actions to be taken}} {{to get out of the}} <b>unsafe</b> <b>condition.</b> The aircraft pressure altitude and pitch angle were decreased while 160 knots computed airspeed remained maintained.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{enormous}} chemical energy in rocket propellants (greater energy by weight than explosives, but lower than gasoline), consequences of accidents can be severe. Most space missions have some problems. In 1986, following the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, American physicist Richard Feynman, having served on the Rogers Commission estimated that the chance of an <b>unsafe</b> <b>condition</b> for a launch of the Shuttle was very roughly 1%; more recently the historical per person-flight risk in orbital spaceflight has been calculated to be around 2% or 4%.|$|E

500|$|Whether Eddy {{considered}} herself healed at {{the time}} is unclear. Two weeks after the fall she requested treatment from another patient of Quimby's, Julius Dresser. In June that year the Mayor of Lynn told the city Eddy had sent them a letter [...] "in which she states that owing to the <b>unsafe</b> <b>condition</b> of ... she slipped and fell, causing serious personal injuries, from which she has little prospect of recovering, and asking for pecuniary recompense for the injuries received." [...] In February 1867 Eddy and her husband, Daniel Patterson, a dentist, {{filed a lawsuit against}} the city to recover damages.|$|E
2500|$|The {{computed}} airspeed remained decreased. A {{few seconds}} later the wind shear alarm occurred. Surprisingly, neither pilot took any remedial action to recover it as per Boeing procedures with auto-throttle and autopilot engaged. At this point, Captain Noor could be heard yelling [...] "no..no.." [...] in extreme anxiety and desperation. Despite getting specific warning about the wind shear condition, the flight crew still did not take any recovery action {{to recover from the}} <b>unsafe</b> <b>condition.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Originally, MSHA {{reported}} {{on its website}} {{that none of the}} violations were considered [...] "immediate risk of injury" [...] and that all but three violations, related to shoring up the roof, were corrected {{by the time of the}} accident.

2500|$|The plane {{suddenly}} encountered another downdraft. This one {{was more}} severe than before and gradually increased for 15 seconds, causing the plane to descend rapidly. Even though the crew had encountered the same problem before, surprisingly, they did not take any recovery action again {{to get out from}} the <b>unsafe</b> <b>condition,</b> which confirmed their ignorance on recovery procedures. The TAWS warning, [...] "Whoop Whoop Pull up!" [...] was heard on the CVR. The Captain responded by making a nose up. However, pressure altitude remained decreasing as well as the thrust, as auto-throttle remained engaged.|$|E
2500|$|Islamabad tower later {{contacted}} the flight crews. First Officer Javid later acknowledged {{it on the}} reminder of Captain Noor. Flight Officer Javid was extremely pre-occupied by severe weather condition {{and seemed to be}} in state of confusion to recover the aircraft from the <b>unsafe</b> <b>condition,</b> as the plane encountered wind shear before. This was the last communication by the Flight Officer and the Captain. The Terrain Awareness System Alarm sounded. The alarm, [...] "Whoop Whoop Whoop" [...] could be heard in the CVR. The crew were still in state of confusion and did not take any recovery action as they were supposed to according to the Boeing Manual. The pitch later decreased from 5° nose up to 0° with airspeed also decreasing.|$|E
2500|$|On September 15, 2008, {{the family}} of a 19-year-old killed in the crash {{announced}} they had filed a claim with Metrolink, generally a precursor to a lawsuit, [...] "alleging the agency chose not to use the available rail safety features," [...] referring to positive train control which they say would have averted the disaster. Eleven days later, an attorney representing the brakeman of the freight train announced a lawsuit against Metrolink, which also named Veolia Transportation and its subsidiary, Connex Railroad, the Metrolink engineer's employer, as defendants. The claim they filed against Metrolink and Veolia was denied, allowing them to proceed with the lawsuit. The lawyer asserted that the Metrolink engineer [...] "was asleep at the switch and not paying attention {{to what was going on}} around him..." [...] and that Metrolink [...] "allowed a dangerous, defective and <b>unsafe</b> <b>condition</b> to exist." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{development}} of rail trails in southeastern Australia {{can be traced}} to the gold rushes of the second half of the 19th century. Dozens of rail lines sprang up, aided by the overly enthusiastic [...] "Octopus Act", but soon became unprofitable as the gold ran out, leading to a decreased demand for timber in turn. Decades later, these easements found a new use as tourist drawcards, once converted to rail trails. Dozens exist in some form, like the [...] Port Fairy to Warrnambool Rail Trail, but only a few — such as the [...] Murray to the Mountains Rail Trail — have been fully developed. Progress is frequently hampered by trestle bridges in <b>unsafe</b> <b>condition,</b> easements that have been sold off to farmers, and lack of funds. Funding is typically contributed in roughly equal parts from federal, state, and local governments, with voluntary labour and in kind donations contributed by local groups.|$|E

Air-traffic control asked SK933 at 19:19:35 to reduce its speed further to take the Cessna into account, and the pilots reduced their speed to [...] This speed requires the full extension of the flaps, but this step was not carried out. The nose gear was showing an unsafe indication; should the flaps be extended fully without the nose gear down, a horn would blow, {{which could not be}} silenced without retracting the flaps. The captain recycled the gear, but the indicator light still showed an <b>unsafe</b> <b>condition.</b> Meanwhile, the first officer believed that the flaps were fully extended, and started reducing speed to [...] After the flight engineer confirmed that the nose gear was down and locked, the captain fully extended the flaps.|$|E
2500|$|The {{state of}} Virginia has enacted the Virginia Tort Claims Act, which waives the {{sovereign}} immunity {{of the state}} with respect to actions brought under certain limitations. However, {{by the terms of}} the statute itself, this waiver does not extend to political subdivisions. Thus, counties, which are considered to be arms of the state, still carry the state's traditional complete immunity from tort lawsuits. Cities and towns are not considered arms of the state, and are only held to be immune from such lawsuits if the city or town was exercising a public or [...] "governmental" [...] function. Such functions have been held to include police and firefighting activities, and education. However, a city or town may be sued when carrying out a [...] "proprietary" [...] function, such as providing gas, electricity, water, sewage collection and disposal, or storm drainage. With regards to building and maintaining of roads, and laying out roads {{is considered to be a}} governmental function, but cleaning and maintaining roads and public ways that have already been laid out is deemed to be proprietary. An activity that combines governmental and proprietary functions is clothed in the protection of governmental functions. A suit can not be brought based on an <b>unsafe</b> <b>condition</b> of the street unless the municipality is first given reasonable notice and allowed a reasonable amount of time to remedy it. The operation of public recreational facilities is stated by the state statute to fall within the immunity of governmental function.|$|E

60|$|Take it {{the other}} way, and let us suppose that France so broken in spirit as to be content to remain naked and defenceless by sea and by land. Is such a country no prey? Have other nations no views? Is Poland the only country {{of which it is}} worth while to make a partition? We cannot be so childish as to imagine that {{ambition}} is local, and that no others can be infected with it but those who rule within certain parallels of latitude and longitude. In this way I hold war equally certain. But I can conceive that both these principles may operate: ambition on the part of Austria to cut more and more from France; and French impatience under her degraded and <b>unsafe</b> <b>condition.</b> In such a contest will the other powers stand by? Will not Prussia call for indemnity, as well as Austria and England? Is she satisfied with her gains in Poland? By no means. Germany must pay; or we shall infallibly see Prussia leagued with France and Spain, and possibly with other powers, for the reduction of Austria; and such may be the situation of things, that it will not be so easy to decide what part England may take in such a contest.|$|E
