A combined strategy of Measles and Rubella universal vaccination {{on children and}} selective vaccination of susceptible women has been shown effective in the elimination of congenital rubella requiring an incidence of < 1 case of CRS per 100, 000 live births. Verification processes of rubella elimination require that physicians early and appropriately diagnose all cases of congenital rubella, including those <b>unpatent</b> at birth. The paper highlights clinical and laboratory aspects channeling diagnosis of congenital rubella infection or syndrome even {{after the first year}} of life, and the short- and long-term management criteria...|$|R
2500|$|Schneier {{designed}} Blowfish as a general-purpose algorithm, {{intended as}} an alternative to the aging DES and free of the problems and constraints associated with other algorithms. At the time Blowfish was released, many other designs were proprietary, encumbered by patents or were commercial or government secrets. Schneier has stated that, [...] "Blowfish is <b>unpatented,</b> and will remain so in all countries. The algorithm is hereby placed in the public domain, and can be freely used by anyone." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{multiple}} spindle spinning jenny {{was invented}} in 1764. James Hargreaves is credited as the inventor. This machine increased the thread production capacity of a single worker [...] initially eightfold and subsequently much further. [...] Others credit the original invention to Thomas Highs. Industrial unrest forced Hargreaves to leave Blackburn, but more importantly for him, his <b>unpatented</b> idea was exploited by others. He finally patented it in 1770. [...] As a result, there were over 20,000 spinning jennies in use (mainly unlicensed) {{by the time of}} his death.|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{then turned}} to the extent, if any, to which {{exhaustion}} of the patent rights on the microprocessor products exhausted patent rights relating to the combination products on which LGE had patents. In the Univis case the sale that exhausted patent rights was a sale of an <b>unpatented</b> semifinished lens blank, which subsequent processing turned into a patented finished lens. [...] The Intel microprocessor products were finished commercial articles of commerce, but in this case the trial court had found as a fact that the microprocessor products had no noninfringing use, just as in the Univis case the semifinished lens blanks had no use but to be finished into the patented finished lens blanks. [...] Therefore, the Court found Univis dispositive. In the Quanta Court’s language, in Univis “exhaustion was triggered by the sale of the lens blanks because their only reasonable and intended use was to practice the patent and because they ‘embodie essential features of [...] patented invention.’” ...|$|E
2500|$|In reality, the Oregon Central Military Wagon Road {{was a giant}} scam, {{designed}} to acquire public lands at little or no cost to the road company’s investors. [...] Nevertheless, the Oregon Central Military Wagon Road Company claimed a total of [...] of public land. [...] The company was able to patent [...] before lawsuits ended the fraud. [...] Legal disputes kept the ownership of these lands in question for decades, preventing honest settlers from claiming land grants for farms and ranches. [...] In addition, the company paid no taxes while the land claims were disputed. [...] At the same time, {{the value of the}} land and its timber, minerals, and grazing potential continued to increase as the property rights were passed from one investor group to the next. [...] Finally, newspaper reports of the fraud compelled Congress to investigate. [...] This led to a major court case, known as the United States versus the California and Oregon Land Company. [...] That case was decided by the United States Supreme Court on 6 March 1893. [...] As a result, the United States Government was able to reclaim the <b>unpatented</b> lands; however, title to patented lands remained in private hands.|$|E
60|$|The {{immediate}} {{business was}} the systematic {{exploitation of the}} fact that Trafford had worked out the problem of synthesizing indiarubber. He had done so with an entire indifference to the commercial possibilities of the case, because he had been irritated by the enormous publicity given to Behrens' assertion that he had achieved this long-sought end. Of course the production of artificial rubbers and rubber-like substances {{had been one of the}} activities of the synthetic chemist for many years, from the appearance of Tilden's isoprene rubber onward, and there was already a formidable list of collaterals, dimethybutadiene, and so forth, by which the coveted goal could be approached. Behrens had boldly added to this list as his own a number of variations upon a theme of Trafford's, originally designed to settle certain curiosities about elasticity. Behrens' products were not only more massively rubber-like than anything that had gone before them, but also extremely cheap to produce, and his bold announcement of success had produced a check in rubber sales and widespread depression in the quiveringly sensitive market of plantation shares. Solomonson had consulted Trafford about this matter at Vevey, and had heard with infinite astonishment that Trafford had already roughly prepared and was proposing to complete and publish, <b>unpatented</b> and absolutely unprotected, first a smashing demonstration of the unsoundness of Behrens' claim and then a lucid exposition of just what had to be done and what could be done to make an indiarubber absolutely indistinguishable from the natural product. The business man could not believe his ears.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] Dehydrators, Ltd. v. Petrolite Corp., {{the owner}} of a process patent {{supplied}} an <b>unpatented</b> product called Tret-O-Lite Turkey Red Oil at a single price that combined a charge {{for the use of the}} process and a charge for the product supplied. The patentee ran afoul of the Leitch case, even though it had publicly offered to any persons who preferred to procure the <b>unpatented</b> product elsewhere the alternative of an unrestricted license to practice the process, upon payment of a royalty based on the difference between the cost of the <b>unpatented</b> product on the open market and the patentee's sale price for the same <b>unpatented</b> product. The court said: ...|$|E
50|$|It is no bar to {{a finding}} of {{infringement}} that the patented object or process {{is a part of}} or composes a broader <b>unpatented</b> structure or process, provided the patented invention is significant or important to the defendant's activities that involve the <b>unpatented</b> structure.|$|E
50|$|The {{fact that}} an <b>unpatented</b> part of a {{combination}} patent may distinguish the invention does not draw to it the privileges of a patent. That may be done only in the manner provided by law. However worthy it may be, however essential to the patent, an <b>unpatented</b> part of a combination patent is no more entitled to monopolistic protection than any other <b>unpatented</b> device. For, as we pointed out in Mercoid Corp. v. Mid-Continent Investment Co., a patent on a combination is a patent on the assembled or functioning whole, not on the separate parts. The legality of any attempt to bring <b>unpatented</b> goods within {{the protection of the}} patent is measured by the antitrust laws, not by the patent law.|$|E
5000|$|The relief here sought is {{indistinguishable from}} that denied in the Motion Picture Case. There, {{it was held}} that to permit the patent owner to [...] "derive its profit not from the {{invention}} on which the law gives it a monopoly, but from the <b>unpatented</b> supplies with which it is used" [...] is [...] "wholly without {{the scope of the}} patent monopoly." [...] If a monopoly could be so expanded, the owner of a patent for a product might conceivably monopolize the commerce in a large part of <b>unpatented</b> materials used in its manufacture. The owner of a patent for a machine might thereby secure a partial monopoly on the <b>unpatented</b> supplies consumed in its operation. The owner of a patent for a process might secure a partial monopoly on the <b>unpatented</b> material employed in it.|$|E
5000|$|The Court {{acknowledged}} that the 1909 decision in Leeds & Catlin v. Victor Talking Machine Co. (No. 2) was authority for the conclusion that [...] "he who sells an <b>unpatented</b> part of a combination patent {{for use in the}} assembled machine may be guilty of contributory infringement." [...] In that case involving a phonograph record and record player, the Court extended patent protection to the <b>unpatented</b> phonograph record, which was an <b>unpatented</b> part of the patented combination. But that ruling [...] "is in substance inconsistent with the view which we have expressed in this case." [...] Accordingly, the rule in that case [...] "must no longer prevail against the defense that a combination patent is being used to protect an <b>unpatented</b> part from competition." [...] To be sure, Honeywell and Mid-Continent could have prevailed against Mercoid on a charge of contributory infringement and secured an injunction [...] "had they not misused the patent for the purpose of monopolizing <b>unpatented</b> material." [...] But they did, and [...] "where there is a collision between the principle of the Carbice case and the conventional rules governing either direct or contributory infringement, the former prevails." ...|$|E
5000|$|As for Mercoid II the Dawson Court {{said that}} it [...] "did not add much to the breathtaking sweep of its {{companion}} decision," [...] but it nonetheless commented: [...] "However worthy it may be, however essential to the patent, an <b>unpatented</b> part of a combination patent is no more entitled to monopolistic protection than any other <b>unpatented</b> device." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{mining claim}} always starts {{out as an}} <b>unpatented</b> claim. The owner of an <b>unpatented</b> claim must {{continue}} mining or exploration activities on an <b>unpatented</b> claim, or he may pay a fee to the land management agency by September 1 of each year, or it is considered abandoned and becomes null. Activities on <b>unpatented</b> claims must be restricted to those necessary to mining. A patented claim is one for which {{the federal government has}} issued a patent (deed). To obtain a patent, the owner of a mining claim must prove to the federal government that the claim contains locatable minerals that can be extracted at a profit. A patented claim can be used for any purpose desired by the owner, just like any other real estate. However, Congress has ceased funding for the patenting process, so at this time a claim cannot be patented.|$|E
5000|$|The court {{then turned}} to the second question—whether the patents altered the case. The court {{maintained}} that a patentee [...] "cannot use his patent rights to restrain trade in <b>unpatented</b> bath tubs." [...] In such cases as the Button-Fastener case, patent tie-ins were held legitimate. But that is not the question in this case. [...] "It would have been presented in this case had Wayman bargained with the corporate 192 defendants that they should buy all their enameling powder from him." [...] That line of case law does not apply to price fixing based on tools to make an <b>unpatented</b> product: [...] "The ownership of a patent for a tool by which old, well-known, and <b>unpatented</b> articles of general use can be more cheaply made gives no right to combine the makers and dealers in the <b>unpatented</b> articles in an agreement to make the public pay more for it.." ...|$|E
5000|$|It is {{a patent}} {{infringement}} to [...] {{someone else to}} infringe a patent. A patent can be a composition of <b>unpatented</b> components; the patent would cover the inventive step of selecting and assembling those components. Manufacture of the <b>unpatented</b> components {{would not be an}} infringement of the patent unless the manufacturer induces the recipient of those components to infringe the patent.|$|E
50|$|The Dry Ice Corporation has {{no right}} to be free from {{competition}} in the sale of solid carbon dioxide. Control over the supply of such <b>unpatented</b> material {{is beyond the scope of}} the patentee's monopoly, and this limitation, inherent in the patent grant, is not dependent upon the peculiar function or character of the <b>unpatented</b> material or on the way in which it is used.|$|E
50|$|The {{core of the}} Rosemont {{property}} {{consists of}} 132 patented lode claims that encompass an area of 1,968 acres. A patented mining claim is one for which {{the federal government has}} passed its title to the claimant, making it private land. A contiguous package of 850 <b>unpatented</b> lode mining claims with an aggregate area of approximately 12,000 ac surrounds the core of patented claims. An <b>unpatented</b> mine claim is one in which land is essentially leased from the government for the purpose of extracting minerals. Most of the <b>unpatented</b> claims are on federal land administered by the United States Forest Service. In addition, a limited number of claims in the northwest portion of the Property are on federal land administered by the Bureau of Land Management.|$|E
5000|$|He {{turned to}} {{the opinion of the}} court of appeals, which chose to give Rohm & Haas a {{monopoly}} over <b>unpatented</b> propanil because [...] "the rights to license another to sell nonstaple <b>unpatented</b> items would be rendered worthless if the only right conferred by (d)(1) were the right to sell the item as one competitor among many freely competing." [...] That was wrong for two reasons. First, Rohm & Haas could collect royalties from its licensed competitors, who would need licenses to avoid contributory infringement liability. Second, [...] "it also is fundamentally inconsistent with the congressional policy 'to preserve and foster competition' in the sale of <b>unpatented</b> materials, a policy that, as we have recognized, survived enactment of § 271." ...|$|E
5000|$|Eureka {{responded to}} the suit with a [...] "demurrer" [...] in which it said (1) its only {{business}} is selling <b>unpatented</b> staples to people using the machines, for which [...] "they are not accountable" [...] to Button-Fastener, and (2) Button-Fastener's restriction {{on the use of}} the machines [...] "whereby a monopoly in an <b>unpatented</b> article is secured to the complainant, is contrary to public policy, and that a court of equity will not enforce it." ...|$|E
50|$|He {{was one of}} {{the commissioners}} {{appointed}} for adjusting the claims to <b>unpatented</b> lands in the counties of Monongalia, Yohogania, and Ohio.|$|E
5000|$|Lurton {{then turned}} to the public policy arguments—that Button-Fastener was {{expanding}} its lawful monopoly over the patented machines to a second monopoly over <b>unpatented</b> staples: ...|$|E
5000|$|Tie-ins of <b>unpatented</b> {{supplies}} [...] "could {{minimize the}} risks associated with the uncertainty that a patent owner may have regarding the value of his/her patented technology." ...|$|E
50|$|It is {{considered}} an infringement to manufacture, use, or even seek to use an <b>unpatented</b> object without permission if part of that object is patented, and the patented part is significant or important. The patented part must be significant or important because it must be shown that it is used when the encompassing <b>unpatented</b> object is used. In Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser, {{it was found that}} the use of a plant which contained patented genes and cells constitutes infringing use of the patented genes and cells.|$|E
50|$|Additional {{considerations}} must {{be taken}} into account where maintenance of the suit concerns the public interest, as well as the private interests of suitors. Where the patent is used as a means of restraining competition with the patentee's sale of an <b>unpatented</b> product, the successful prosecution of an infringement suit, even against one who is not a competitor in such sale, is a powerful aid to the maintenance of the attempted monopoly of the <b>unpatented</b> article, and is thus a contributing factor in thwarting the public policy underlying the grant of the patent.|$|E
50|$|In the 1920s and 1930, United States Gypsum sued {{a number}} of gypsum board {{manufacturers}} for patent infringement, prevailed in the litigation, and settled with the defendants by granting them licenses with price-fixing clauses. Since 1937 United States Gypsum has maintained rigid control over the price and terms of sale of all gypsum board. The license agreements provided that royalties should be paid on the sales of all board sold, patented or <b>unpatented.</b> This provision tended to discourage any production of <b>unpatented</b> board because it was more costly to manufacture than the patented board.|$|E
5000|$|As of 2009, Smucker's {{is selling}} the <b>unpatented</b> {{sandwiches}} under the [...] "Uncrustables" [...] trademark. The company built {{a plant in}} 2004 in Scottsville, Kentucky, to produce the product.|$|E
50|$|Where {{the patent}} {{is used as}} a means of {{restraining}} competition with the patentee's sale of an <b>unpatented</b> product, the successful prosecution of an infringement suit, even against one who is not a competitor in such sale, is a powerful aid to the maintenance of the attempted monopoly of the <b>unpatented</b> article, and is thus a contributing factor in thwarting the public policy underlying the grant of the patent. Maintenance and enlargement of the attempted monopoly of the <b>unpatented</b> article are dependent to some extent upon persuading the public of the validity of the patent, which the infringement suit is intended to establish. Equity may rightly withhold its assistance from such a use of the patent by declining to entertain a suit for infringement, and should do so at least until it is made to appear that the improper practice has been abandoned and that the consequences of the misuse of the patent have been dissipated.|$|E

50|$|Talbot v. Laroche (unreported) was an 1854 legal action, pivotal to {{the history}} of photography, by which William Fox Talbot sought to assert that Martin Laroche's use of the <b>unpatented,</b> {{collodion}} process infringed his calotype patent.|$|E
5000|$|The Court cited Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co. for the {{proposition}} that a patentee [...] "may not exact as the condition of a license that <b>unpatented</b> materials used {{in connection with the}} invention shall be purchased only from the licensor, and if it does so, relief against one who supplies such <b>unpatented</b> materials will be denied. The limited monopoly to make, use, and vend an article may not be 'expanded by limitations as to materials and supplies necessary to the operation of it.'&#8239;" [...] The Court added, [...] "The relief here sought is indistinguishable from that denied in the Motion Picture Case." ...|$|E
