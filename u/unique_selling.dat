25|$|The {{removal of}} a {{bottleneck}} by means like the tunnel does not necessarily induce economic gains in all adjacent regions. The image of a region being connected to the European high-speed transport and active political response are more important for regional economic development. Some small-medium enterprises located {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the terminal have used the opportunity to re-brand the profile of their business with positive effect, such as The New Inn at Etchinghill which was able to commercially exploit its <b>unique</b> <b>selling</b> point as being 'the closest pub to the Channel Tunnel'. Tunnel-induced regional development is small compared to general economic growth. The South East of England is likely to benefit developmentally and socially from faster and cheaper transport to continental Europe, but the benefits are unlikely to be equally distributed throughout the region. The overall environmental impact is almost certainly negative.|$|E

2500|$|Task Review: Revolution {{decided to}} create a {{multi-purpose}} storage unit/games table made from cardboard called [...] "Flex N Store", with the idea being formed {{from a combination of}} suggestions during their brainstorming. Although Zoe provided an excellent pitch for the product, the retailers heavily criticised it for not having a <b>unique</b> <b>selling</b> point and for being so flimsy that it fell apart after the first few uses. Meanwhile, Instinct {{decided to create}} a sledge on detachable wheels called [...] "Slide Stuff", which they aimed at selling to festival-goers. While their prototype was very small and thus was criticised by the retailers for appearing to be unsuitable for the amount it would carry, Arjun's pitches helped the team to secure orders, granting them victory.|$|E

Additionally, Oliver Kent was brought in as the Head of Continuing Drama Series for BBC Scripted Studios, meaning that Kent would oversee EastEnders along with O'Connor. O'Connor's approach to the show {{was to have a}} firmer focus on realism, which he said was being [...] "true to EastEnders DNA and [...] a way of capturing {{what it would be like}} if Julia Smith and Tony Holland were making the show now." [...] He said that [...] "EastEnders has always had a distinctly different tone from the other soaps but over time we've diluted our <b>unique</b> <b>selling</b> point. I think we need to be ourselves and go back to the origins of the show and what made it successful in the first place. It should be entertaining but it should also be informative—that's part of our unique BBC compact with the audience. It shouldn't just be a distraction from your own life, it should be an exploration of the life shared by the audience and the characters." [...] O'Connor planned to stay with EastEnders until the end of 2017, but announced his departure on 23 June 2017 with immediate effect, saying he wanted to concentrate on a career in film. John Yorke returned as a temporary creative director. Kent said, [...] "John Yorke is a Walford legend and I am thrilled that he will be joining us for a short period to oversee the show and to help us build on Sean's legacy while we recruit a long-term successor." ...|$|E

However, {{the question on}} choosing the appropriate proxy, i. e., R 2 or idiosyncratic volatility, is less investigated. This paper provides alternative evidences that R 2 and idiosyncratic volatility are not interchangeable with the utilization of a <b>unique</b> short <b>selling</b> mechanism in China. Specifically, we mainly find that 1) R 2 is not a satisfied proxy when the information environment for individual firm is improved, while idiosyncratic volatility is a satisfied proxy under the improved information environment; 2) R 2 and idiosyncratic volatility are satisfied proxies for firm-specific return variation when the information environment for individual firm is deteriorated. These results also complement the existing literature on figuring out the appropriate proxy for firm-specific return variation under different information environment...|$|R
