Seafaring Hebrideans had numerous taboos concerning spoken references to islands.

25|$|The Apocalypse of Moses (literally, the Revelation of Moses) is the <b>usual</b> <b>name</b> for the Greek {{version of}} the Life of Adam and Eve. This title was given to it by Tischendorf, its first editor, and taken up by others. In the text, Moses is {{referred}} to only in the first sentence as the prophet to whom the story was revealed.

500|$|... 1922 – '"I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate"' is a jazz {{composition}} {{with words}} and Lyrics by Armand J. Piron. It {{was published in}} 1922 with copyright assigned to the publishing house of Clarence Williams. The song was promoted through numerous instrumental recordings for different labels by the Original Memphis Five under their <b>usual</b> <b>name</b> and as The Cotton Pickers. They also accompanied the African American singer Leona Williams named as Her Dixie Band. Clarence Williams himself recorded the song playing solo piano accompaniment to his wife Eva Taylor. The song was revived in a 1939 recording by Muggsy Spanier and His Ragtime Band with a vocal chorus by George Brunies, which established {{its status as a}} standard.|$|E

500|$|Most of {{the debate}} about the date of the poem has {{employed}} linguistic arguments, mostly concerning rhyme (since more is known about early Welsh phonology than other aspects of the language, like syntax). It is believed that {{around the time of the}} battle, the British language was transitioning into its daughter languages: the primitive form of Welsh in Wales, of Cornish and Breton in southwestern Britain and Brittany, and Cumbric in northern Britain. Kenneth Jackson concludes that the majority of the changes that transformed British into Primitive Welsh belong to the period from the middle of the 5th to the end of the 6th century. This involved syncope and the loss of final syllables. If the poem dates to this time, it would have been written in an early form of Cumbric, the <b>usual</b> <b>name</b> for the Brythonic speech of the Hen Ogledd. Jackson suggested the name [...] "Primitive Cumbric" [...] for the dialect spoken at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Extreme Unction was the <b>usual</b> <b>name</b> for {{the sacrament}} in the West {{from the late}} twelfth century until 1972, and was thus used at the Council of Trent and in the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia. Peter Lombard (died 1160) is the first writer known to have used the term, which did not become the <b>usual</b> <b>name</b> in the West till {{towards the end of}} the twelfth century, and never became current in the East. The word [...] "extreme" [...] (final) {{indicated}} either that it was the last of the sacramental unctions (after the anointings at Baptism, Confirmation and, if received, Holy Orders) or because at that time it was normally administered only when a patient was in extremis.|$|E

2500|$|Asbestos use {{dates back}} at least 4,500 years, when the {{inhabitants}} of the Lake Juojärvi region in East Finland strengthened earthenware pots and cooking utensils with the asbestos mineral anthophyllite (see Asbestos-ceramic). One of the first descriptions of a material that may have been asbestos is in Theophrastus, On Stones, from around 300 BC, although this identification has been questioned. In both modern and ancient Greek, the <b>usual</b> <b>name</b> for the material known in English as [...] "asbestos" [...] is amiantos ("undefiled", [...] "pure"), which was adapted into the French amiante and Portuguese amianto. In modern Greek, the word ἀσβεστος or ασβέστης stands consistently and solely for lime.|$|E
2500|$|About 1300 the {{chaperon}} {{began to}} be worn by putting the hole intended for the face {{over the top of}} the head instead; perhaps in hot weather. [...] This left the cornette tail and the cape or patte, [...] hanging loose from the top of the head. [...] This became fashionable, and [...] chaperons {{began to be}} made to be worn in this style. [...] Some authorities only use the term chaperon for this type, calling the earlier forms hoods – which was certainly their <b>usual</b> <b>name</b> in English. [...] This is a categorisation for modern discussions only; there is no dispute over whether chaperon was the contemporary term.

2500|$|It is {{believed}} that {{around the time of}} the battle described in the poem Y Gododdin, Common Brittonic was transitioning into its daughter languages: Cumbric in North Britain, Old Welsh in Wales, and Southwestern Brittonic, the ancestor of Cornish and Breton.

2500|$|In the 18th century, {{the mark}} was {{generally}} known in English as the [...] "oblique".

Clarifying terms such as [...] "forward slash" [...] have been coined owing to widespread use of Microsoft's DOS and Windows operating systems, which use the backslash extensively.|$|E
2500|$|The barmaster or {{his deputy}} granted title in a mine, the <b>usual</b> <b>name</b> for which was grove or groove, on receipt of proof {{that it was}} viable.

He was given permission to work 2 meers of ground, known as founder meers, with no restriction on width or depth. A third meer was the king's, and other miners were each allowed to open a further meer, taker meers, along the vein. The miner marked each meer with his possessions or stows (a miniature version of the stows or windlass used to wind the ore from the shaft). A meer was , in the Wirksworth Wapentake.|$|E

And the sting of it was, that I quite well knew myself to be a worldly little devil. Worldly as to wanting to be housed and warmed, worldly as to wanting to be fed, worldly as to the greed with which I inwardly compared how much I got of those good things with how much father and mother got, when, rarely, those good things were going.|$|E
60|$|Although, therefore, all {{processes}} of thought {{in which the}} ultimate premises are particulars, whether we conclude from particulars to a general formula, or from particulars to other particulars according to that formula, are equally Induction; we shall yet, conformably to usage, consider the name Induction as more peculiarly belonging {{to the process of}} establishing the general proposition, and the remaining operation, which is substantially that of interpreting the general proposition, we shall call by its <b>usual</b> <b>name,</b> Deduction. And we shall consider every process by which any thing is inferred respecting an unobserved case, as consisting of an Induction followed by a Deduction; because, although the process needs not necessarily be carried on in this form, it is always susceptible of the form, and must be thrown into it when assurance of scientific accuracy is needed and desired.|$|E
