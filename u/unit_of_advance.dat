40|$|Objective: The overall {{objective}} of the research effort is to identify, test and select candidate iron and nickel base alloys and aluminized coatings for applications in air and thermal management <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>advanced</b> SOFC power generation systems. It is also {{the objective of this}} study to develop mechanistic understanding of surface and bulk corrosion and degradation, long term protection and chromium evaporation processes. BACKGROUND: The air and thermal management <b>units</b> <b>of</b> the SOFC systems remain exposed to high temperature and oxidizing environment during the nominal and transient operating conditions. Materials of construction experience surface corrosion and gaseous corrosion products formation resulting in the loss of metal and chromium poisoning of the SOFC cathode. �Chromia forming iron and nickel base alloys have been conventionally used for the fabrication of such sub systems. These alloys remain prone to enhanced metal loss, grain boundary attack and surface oxide evaporation. Presence of water vapor in air has been reported to enhance such evaporation due to the formation of various oxides and hydroxyoxides vapor species 1 - 3. The long term successful operation of SOFC sub system requires minimization of metal loss as well as Cr-evaporation from the surface oxides. RESULTS...|$|R

40|$|In {{developing}} countries burn injuries {{are much more}} common than in the USA and Europe or other affluent developed countries, due to poverty, overcrowding, and illiteracy, and are associated with higher mortality rates. The high incidence makes burns an endemic health hazard in these countries. Over 90 % of burn-related fatalities occur in developing or low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with south-east Asia alone accounting for over half of fire-related deaths. Management of burns and their sequelae even in the well-equipped, modern burn <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>advanced</b> affluent societies remains demanding despite advances in surgical techniques and development of tissue-engineered biomaterials available to these burn centres. Undoubtedly, in a developing country with limited resources and inaccessibility to sophisticated skills and technologies, management of burns constitutes a major challenge. The present {{review of the literature}} analyses the challenges facing burn management in LMICs and explores probable modalities to optimize burn management in these countries. The review will be published in three parts. Part I will present the epidemiology of burn injuries and challenges for management in LMICs. Part II will be about management of burn injuries in LMICs and Part III will discuss strategies for proper prevention and burn care in LMICs...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (D. M. A.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 The {{inspiration}} {{to create this}} method of rhythmic reading came from working with students in class and private instruction settings {{for nearly two decades}} and noticing a common trend: students of varying levels of advancement routinely lack a fundamental sense of steady beat and the ability to accurately interpret and perform rhythmic notation. These problems become more profound in sight-reading portions of classes and lessons. This method is an attempt to provide instructors in either a private instruction or class setting a method by which they can help students develop rhythmic accuracy (separate from pitch), as well as cultivate a better sense of underlying pulse and a more complete understanding of meter. Rhythmic relationships and ratios are studied, as well as pulse/beat, meter (simple and compound with various beat notes), tempo, division, subdivision, dots, ties, and other related topics. Folk tunes and traditional rhymes are used to practice new concepts and help developing musicians master topics using familiar material. This method has twelve <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>advancing</b> complexity, each featuring topics for discussion, rhythmic drills for individual practice, two-handed practice exercises, counting tips, worksheets, and ensembles for group practice. A variety of performance suggestions inspire teachers to create fun and innovative learning experiences in diverse pedagogical settings. The method is well-suited for students as they progress past elementary levels of musicianship; completion <b>of</b> all twelve <b>units</b> will provide a thorough foundation for the more complex rhythms and metric nuances found in intermediate and advanced literature...|$|R
