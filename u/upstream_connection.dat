50|$|Coaxial cables {{are capable}} of {{bi-directional}} carriage of signals {{as well as the}} transmission of large amounts of data. Cable television signals use only a portion of the bandwidth available over coaxial lines. This leaves plenty of space available for other digital services such as cable internet, cable telephony and wireless services, using both unlicensed and licensed spectrum. Broadband internet access is achieved over coaxial cable by using cable modems to convert the network data into a type of digital signal that can be transferred over coaxial cable. One problem with some cable systems is the older amplifiers placed along the cable routes are unidirectional thus in order to allow for uploading of data the customer would need to use an analog telephone modem to provide for the <b>upstream</b> <b>connection.</b> This limited the upstream speed to 31.2k and prevented the always-on convenience broadband internet typically provides.

That is, we investigate how different alignments of synchronous pauses in synthetic Purkinje neuron spike trains affect either time-locking or rate-changes in the downstream nuclei. We find that Purkinje neuron synchrony is mainly represented by changes in the firing rate of cerebellar nuclei neurons. Pause beginning synchronization produced a unique effect on nuclei neuron firing, while the effect of pause ending and pause overlapping synchronization could not be distinguished from each other. Pause beginning synchronization produced better time-locking of nuclear neurons for short length pauses. We also characterize the effect of pause length and spike jitter on the nuclear neuron firing.

40|$|Multihoming has {{traditionally}} been employed by stub networks to enhance the reliability of their network connectivity. With the advent of commercial "intelligent route control" products, stubs now leverage multihoming to improve performance. Although multihoming is widely used for reliability and, increasingly for performance, not much {{is known about the}} tangible benefits that multihoming can offer, or how these benefits can be fully exploited. In this paper, we aim to quantify the extent to which multihomed networks can leverage performance and reliability benefits from connections to multiple providers. We use data collected from servers belonging to the Akamai content distribution network to evaluate performance benefits from two distinct perspectives of multihoming: high-volume content-providers which transmit large volumes of data to many distributed clients, and enterprises which primarily receive data from the network. In both cases, we find that multihoming can improve performance significantly and that not choosing the right set of providers could result in a performance penalty as high as 40 %. We also find evidence of diminishing returns in performance when more than four providers are considered for multihoming. In addition, using a large collection of measurements, we provide an analysis of the reliability benefits of multihoming. Finally, we provide guidelines on how multihomed networks can choose ISPs, and discuss practical strategies of using multiple <b>upstream</b> <b>connections</b> to achieve optimal performance benefits...|$|R
50|$|Manifolded twin {{and triple}} {{cylinder}} sets {{have been used}} {{since the days of}} Cousteau and Gagnan's development of the open circuit regulator, as can be seen from early photographs of the equipment. These were downstream manifolds, which connected the cylinders together by linking the outlets of the cylinder valves, and had one outlet for a regulator. This arrangement allowed larger gas storage capacity using the limited range of cylinders available. Independent valving of the manifolded cylinders also allowed the gas supply to be monitored in the absence of submersible pressure gauges, by opening and closing the valves in a specific order, as the gas was used up. The need to remember the history of valve operation and the lack of facility to connect a redundant regulator made the use of independent twins the usual alternative. This also has limitations, even when the contents can be closely monitored by using submersible pressure gauges. In 1970 a group of divers including Tom Mount, Ike Ikehara and George Benjamin came up with the concept and had the first recorded dual outlet scuba valves prototyped. These allowed <b>upstream</b> <b>connection</b> of the cylinders, with a regulator on the valved outlet of each cylinder.|$|E
30|$|So one {{approach}} of detecting stepping-stone intrusion is {{to estimate the}} number of compromised hosts used as stepping-stones in a connection chain. In other words, this detection method is to estimate {{the length of a}} connection chain. The longer the connection chain is, the more suspicious the connection is. It makes a more reasonable sense to determine an intrusion {{based on the number of}} hosts used as stepping-stones, other than a single host detected to be used as a stepping-stone. As we mentioned before many times, detecting intrusion based on stepping-stone detection may bring false positive errors. Similarly, detecting intrusion using the length of a connection chain may incur false negative detection error. The reason is that we can only estimate the length of the downstream section in a connection chain, other than the length of the whole connection chain. If a sensor happens to be close to the victim host, the length of the downstream connection chain would be trivial. In such a case, the <b>upstream</b> <b>connection</b> would dominate the length of the whole chain, but it cannot be estimated. In this scenario, the intrusion would escape from the detection. But this approach can definitely bring down false positive error because it does not count the <b>upstream</b> <b>connection.</b> If a downstream connection has more than three hosts used as stepping-stones, plus <b>upstream</b> <b>connection,</b> it would definitely be more than three compromised hosts. Obviously, if we want to minimize false negative detection error, it is necessary to know the length of the <b>upstream</b> <b>connection</b> which is currently still an open problem even though some researchers proposed several methods toward solving this problem. In the following, if we mention the length of a connection chain, it always means a downstream connection.|$|E
30|$|Upstream {{detection}} {{becomes more}} difficult and complex because of the loose coupling of send and echo packets. The send packets received from the upstream have little relation with the echo packets returned back to an intruder’s computer. Unlike downstream detection, computing the length of an <b>upstream</b> <b>connection</b> precisely {{would be much more}} difficult. However, upon the observation of user’s keystroke behavior which can be modeled as Poisson distribution, we found that, as an interactive process for an intrusion, the intruder needs to think and pause after his/her input to determine what to do next upon the responses. We can explore the relations among the signals: user’s behavior (signal 1), user’s input (signal 2), and the response (signal 3). Through carefully processing these three signals, it is feasible to identify if an <b>upstream</b> <b>connection</b> is long or short. The third open problem is to apply signal processing technique to stepping-stone intrusion detection. Chaffed packets are hard to be filtered completely and make the existing stepping-stone intrusion detecting approaches not successful. Due to different distributions, chaffed packets can be treated as a signal which is different from regular traffic packets. So a chaffed connection can be considered as a signal which contains regular traffic packets and chaffed packets. The signal is in time domain. If we can use FFT or some other methods to transfer the time domain signal to be a frequency domain signal, it is feasible to use signal processing technique to remove the chaffed packets in frequency domain.|$|E

40|$|Site {{multi-homing}} is {{an important}} capability in modern military networks. Resilience of a site is greatly enhanced when it has multiple <b>upstream</b> <b>connections</b> to the Global Information Grid, including the global Internet. Similarly, the ability to provide traffic engineering for a site can be important in reducing delays and packet loss over lowbandwidth and/or high-delay uplinks. Current approaches to site multi-homing and site traffic engineering (a) require assistance from a trusted network service provider; (b) inject significant additional routing information into the global Internet routing system. This approach reduces flexibility, does not scale and is a widespread concern today. The proposed Identifier-Locator Network Protocol (ILNP) offers backward compatible extensions for IPv 6 to enable a site to (a) use multiple routing prefixes concurrently, without needing to advertise these more-specific site prefixes upstream to the site’s service providers; (b) enables edgesite controlled traffic engineering and localised addressing, without breaking end-to-end connectivity. This feature combination provides both multi-homing and traffic engineering capabilities without any adverse impact on the routing system and does not require anything more than unicast routing capability in the provider network. ILNP enables concurrent multi-path transmission for a flow, without requiring multicast routing, to increase flow resilience to path interruptions. This technique has a secondary security benefit of {{reducing the risk of}} an adversary successfully blocking an ILNP flow via a Denial-of-Service attack on any single path or single link. I...|$|R

30|$|Another open {{problem is}} stepping-stone {{intrusion}} upstream detection. The problem {{is significant because}} without upstream detection, most methods we discussed in this survey bring false negative errors. For example, estimating {{the length of a}} connection chain is a method to detect stepping-stone intrusion effectively and accurately. Unfortunately, the detecting accuracy really depends on where a sensor is located in a connection chain. The more close to the victim a sensor is, the less accuracy of the detection, and the higher false negative errors introduced by detection methods. The main reason is that when we estimate the length of a connection chain, we only count the downstream connection which is from a sensor to the victim. The <b>upstream</b> <b>connection</b> which is from a sensor to the attacker’s host is not counted. Only counting both downstream and upstream of a connection can allow detecting approach to obtain an accurate estimation of the length of a whole connection chain.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — An {{opportunistic}} large array (OLA) {{is a form}} {{of cooperative}} diversity in which a large group of simple, inexpensive relays or forwarding nodes operate without any mutual coordination, but naturally fire together in response to energy received from a single source or another OLA. When used for broadcast, OLAs form concentric rings around the source, and have been shown to use less energy than conventional multi-hop protocols. This paper proposes two schemes, one for general OLA transmission and one specifically for upstream routing in the topology of wireless sensor networks, that each save over 50 % of the energy of flooding. The OLA-T scheme uses a transmission threshold to suppress nodes that would make weak contributions. The OLA Concentric Routing Algorithm (OLACRA) takes advantage of the concentric ring structure of broadcast OLAs to limit flooding on the <b>upstream</b> <b>connection.</b> Combination of these two schemes and variations of OLACRA are evaluated in terms of energy savings and probability of successful upstream routing...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} the first attempt in the {{literature}} on the subject of comparing water balance equations for floodplain lake basins {{depending on the type of}} connection the lake has to its parent river. Where confluent lakes (<b>upstream</b> <b>connections)</b> were concerned, it was only possible to apply a classic water balance equation. When dealing with contrafluent lakes (downstream connections) as well as lakes with a complex recharge type (contrafluent–confluent) modified equations were created. The hydrological type of a lake is decided by high water flow conditions and, consequently, the duration of potamophase (connection with a river) and limnophase (the isolation of the lake), which determine the values of particular components and the proportion of the vertical to horizontal water exchange rate. Confluent lakes are characterised by the highest proportion of horizontal components (the inflow and runoff of river water) to the vertical ones (precipitation and evaporation). The smallest differences occur with respect to a contrafluent lake. In the case of confluent lakes, the relationship between water balance components resulted from the consequent water flow through the basin, consistent with the slope of the river channel and valley. The supplying channels of contrafluent lakes had an obsequent character, which is why the flow rate was lower. Lakes with a complex, contrafluent–confluent recharge type showed intermediate features. After a period of slow contrafluent recharge, the inflow of water through a downstream crevasse from the area of the headwater of the river was activated; this caused a radical change of flow conditions into confluent ones. The conditions of water retention in lake basins were also varied. Apart from hydrological recharge, also the orographic features of the catchment areas of the lakes played an important role here, for example, the distance from the river channel, the altitude at which a given catchment was located within the floodplain and the complexity of the channels of fluvial-water inflow...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{the second}} half of the 19 th century, {{channelization}} of large multi-thread rivers such as the Rhine, the Danube, and the Rhône rivers induced artificial disconnection of most of their secondary channels. Compared to naturally abandoned channels, terrestrialization (i. e., the passage from the aquatic to the terrestrial stage, controlled by sediment deposits and/or lowering of the water level) patterns and rates of such artificially prematurely abandoned channels remain largely unknown. Moreover, factors controlling their evolutionary trajectories are complex owing to a set of pressures occurring throughout the 20 th century within specific space-time windows. Through a case study of the Rhône River, this paper aims to assess and distinguish the effects of a set of potential controlling factors on abandoned channel terrestrialization dynamics and lifespan. We tested the influence of: (i) submersible embankments closing the entrance of abandoned channels, (ii) main channel degradation following its channelization or the water level lowering due to channel bypassing in the middle of the 20 th century involving drastic water abstraction in these reaches, (iii) transverse dykes within the abandoned channels, (iv) the flooding regime of abandoned channels (i. e., frequency and magnitude of <b>upstream</b> <b>connections</b> producing lotic functioning), and (v) longitudinal variation in the suspended sediment concentration along the main channel. To this end, we studied 24 abandoned channels (16 artificially disconnected at their upstream end by submersible embankments and eight naturally disconnected by bar plug establishment) from the mid- 19 th to the beginning of the 20 th century. Their terrestrialization rates were characterized through the reconstruction of their planimetric trajectories using historical maps and aerial photos. The results reveal a much longer lifespan of artificial abandoned channels compared to natural ones because of the truncation of the initial bedload infilling phase due to the artificial and imposed closing of their entrance. Moreover, terrestrialization occurred faster when water level lowering or channel degradation was greater. Surprisingly, terrestrialization rates were the highest in the most frequently connected artificial abandoned channels (i. e., channels with a high frequency of lotic functioning), probably in relation to the roughness induced by the presence of transversal dykes. Finally, it is difficult to rank all the factors tested because of their complex combinations, which can change in space and time...|$|R

Although dissimilatory reduction of ClO 4 - and ClO 3 - could be inferred from the accumulation of chloride ions either in spent media or in soil slurries prepared from exposed freshwater lake sediment, neither of these oxyanions evoked methane oxidation when added to either anaerobic mixed cultures or soil enriched in methanotrophs. In contrast, ClO 2 - amendment elicited such activity. Methane (0. 2 kPa) was completely removed within several days from the headspace of cell suspensions of Dechloromonas agitata CKB incubated with either Methylococcus capsulatus Bath or Methylomicrobium album BG 8 {{in the presence of}} 5 mM ClO 2 -. We also observed complete removal of 0. 2 kPa CH 4 in bottles containing soil enriched in methanotrophs when co-incubated with D. agitata CKB and 10 mM ClO 2 -. However, to be effective these experiments required physical separation of soil from D. agitata CKB to allow for the partitioning of O 2 liberated from chlorite dismutation into the shared headspace. Although a link between ClO 2 - and CH 4 consumption was established in soils and cultures, no <b>upstream</b> <b>connection</b> with either ClO 4 - or ClO 3 - was discerned.

Near the <b>upstream</b> <b>connection</b> sediment is deposited on the seabed in front of the structure. Sediment will pile up against the structure resulting in less erosion near the connection.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{involvement}} of the ERK cascade in human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) -induced steroidogenesis by primary cultures of immature rat Leydig cells. Our findings indicate that protein kinase A and protein kinase C function as <b>upstream</b> kinases in <b>connection</b> with transduction of the signal from the gonadotropin receptor to the ERK cascade. These MAPKs enhance the stimulatory effects of hCG on the de novo synthesis of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and the activity of protein phosphatase 2 A, which are associated with increased androgen production by the Leydig cell. Specific inhibition of ERK 1 / 2 by Uo 126 suppressed all of these cellular responses to hCG. In contrast, steroidogenesis LH SECRETED BY THE pituitary gland plays a central role in regulation of reproductive function in both male and female mammals. In the case of the testis, LH regulate...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new power line {{conditioner}} {{consisting of two}} small rating series active filters and a shunt passive filter. The power line conditioner aims at a general filtering system which will be installed {{at the point of}} common coupling in a power system feeding harmonic-sensitive loads and unidentified harmonic-producing loads. One of the two active filters is connected in series with the supply, while another is in series with the shunt passive filter. The purpose of the power line conditioner is to reduce voltage distortion at the connection point, and is to eliminate harmonic currents escaping into the system <b>upstream</b> of the <b>connection</b> point. A control scheme of the two series active filters which play an important role is described in this paper. Its filtering characteristics are discussed with the focus on voltage and current distortion. A prototype model of 20 kVA is constructed to verify the functionality and performance of the power line conditioner</p...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was an {{examination}} of state-dependent functional connectivity during spontaneous activity between the piriform cortex and its <b>upstream</b> and downstream <b>connections.</b> Rats were anesthetized with urethan and allowed to spontaneously cycle between fast- and slow-wave states similar to fast- and slow-wave sleep states. Local field potential recordings were made from the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, dorsal hippocampus, amygdala, and primary visual cortex. The results demonstrate that during slow-wave sleep-like states, when the piriform cortex shows reduced sensitivity to odor input via the olfactory bulb, there is enhanced coherence with other forebrain structures. Granger causality analyses suggest that the link between piriform cortical and hippocampal activity during slow-wave state is {{in the direction of}} the hippocampus to the piriform cortex rather than the reverse. The results suggest that slow-wave sleep-like states may provide an opportunity for the transfer and/or consolidation of information related to odor memories, specifically at a time when the piriform cortex is less sensitive to sensory input...|$|R
