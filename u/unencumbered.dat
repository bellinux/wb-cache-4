30|$|It {{is clear}} that {{a broad range of}} markerless {{technologies}} have emerged from computer vision research over recent times, which have the potential to be applied across diverse disciplines and settings. The priorities and requirements for a markerless motion capture system will depend on the research area and the unique capture environment, and are thus non-uniform across disciplines. In sports biomechanics and rehabilitation applications, motion analysis systems must be highly accurate in order to detect subtle changes in motion, as well as being adaptable, non-invasive and <b>unencumbering.</b> With these system requirements in mind, the current progression of technologies suggests that the future of practical markerless motion capture will lie with techniques such as those presented by Elhayek et al.

We use two air cannons that launch vortex rings that collide at a target point and break by themselves, distributing their smell {{at the point where}} they were broken to make a small “spot ” of scent.

40|$|An {{objective}} {{method of}} assessing information workload based on physiological measurements was developed. Information workload, or reserve capacity, {{was measured using}} a visual discrimination secondary task and subjective rating of task difficulty. The primary task was two axis (pitch and roll) tracking, and the independent variables {{in this study were}} aircraft pitch dynamics and wind gust disturbances. The study was structured to provide: (1) a sensitive, nonloading measure of reserve capacity, and (2) an <b>unencumbering</b> reliable measurement of the psychophysiological state. From these, a measured workload index (MWI) and physiological workload index (PWI) were extracted.

40|$|Prone {{ventilation}} (PV) is a ventilatory {{strategy that}} frequently improves oxygenation and lung mechanics in critical illness, yet does not consistently improve survival. While the exact physiologic mechanisms {{related to these}} benefits remain unproven, one major theoretical mechanism relates to reducing the abdominal encroachment upon the lungs. Concurrent to this experience is increasing recognition of the ubiquitous role of intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) in critical illness, {{of the relationship between}} IAH and intra-abdominal volume or thus the compliance of the abdominal wall, and of the potential difference in the abdominal influences between the extrapulmonary and pulmonary forms of acute respiratory distress syndrome. The present paper reviews reported data concerning intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) in association with the use of PV to explore the potential influence of IAH. While early authors stressed the importance of gravitationally unloading the abdominal cavity to <b>unencumber</b> the lung bases, this admonition has not been consistently acknowledged when PV has been utilized. Basic data required to understand the role of IAP/IAH in the physiology of PV have generally not been collected and/or reported. No randomized controlled trials or meta-analyses considered IAH in design or outcome. While the act of proning itself has a variable reported effect on IAP, abundant clinical and laboratory data confirm that the thoracoabdominal cavities are intimately linked and that IAH is consistently transmitted across the diaphragm - although the transmission ratio is variable and is possibly related to the compliance of the abdominal wall. Any proning-related intervention that secondarily influences IAP/IAH is likely to greatly influence respiratory mechanics and outcomes. Further study of the role of IAP/IAH in the physiology and outcomes of PV in hypoxemic respiratory failure is thus required. Theories relating inter-relations between prone positioning and the abdominal condition are presented to aid in designing these studies...|$|R
40|$|Most {{attempts}} to realize an olfactory display have involved capturing and synthesizing the odor, processes that still pose many challenging problems. These difficulties are mainly {{due to the}} mechanism of human olfaction, in which a set of so-called “primary odors ” has not been found. Instead, we focus on spatio-temporal control of odor rather than synthesizing odor itself. Many existing interactive olfactory displays simply diffuse the scent into the air, which does not provide the ability of spatiotemporal control of olfaction. Recently, however, several researchers have developed olfactory displays that inject scented air under the nose through tubes. On the analogy of visual displays, these systems correspond to headmounted displays (HMD). These yield a solid way to achieve spatio-temporal control of olfactory space, but they require the user to wear something {{on his or her}} face. Here, we propose an <b>unencumbering</b> olfactory display that does not require the user to attach anything on the face. It works by projecting a clump of scented air from a location near the user’s nose through free space. We also aim to display a scent to the restricted space around a specific user’s nose, rather than scattering scented air by simply diffusing it into the atmosphere. To implement this concept, we used an “air cannon ” that generates toroidal vortices of the scented air. We conducted a preliminary experiment to examine this method’s ability to display scent to a restricted space. The results show that we could successfully display incense to the target user. Next, we constructed prototype systems. We could successfully bring the scented air to a specific user by tracking the nose position of the user and controlling the orientation of the air cannon to the user’s nose. 1...|$|R

40|$|Ninety {{percent of}} North American youth {{participate}} in organized sport during childhood and/or adolescence (Jellineck 2 ̆ 6 Durant, 2004; USDHHS, 2010). Parents are also active participants, exhibiting {{a range of}} involvement behaviors {{over the course of}} a child 2 ̆ 7 s athletic development. As such, organized youth sport provides a common context for family interaction whereby parent behavior can shape the child 2 ̆ 7 s developmental experience. As parents continue to invest a growing percentage of family resources into the athletic development and success of their children, the quantity and quality of parental involvement in youth sport has become an important cultural discussion. Although researchers have a systematic understanding of this parent involvement in organized youth sport, there is disconnection in the transfer of that knowledge to parents. Therefore, there is a critical need to provide parents an educational platform informed by evidence-based principles of parenting in organized youth sport. The purpose of the present study was to assess community readiness and best practices for implementing a league-wide parent education program. Through qualitative interviews with league administrators (n = 11), coaches (n = 13), and parents (n = 12) we sought key stakeholder perceptions of core design components of, and barriers to, parent education programming in organized youth sport.

Early German successes were conducted when Allied aircraft could not make a significant impact on the battlefield. In May 1940, there was near parity in numbers of aircraft between the Luftwaffe and the Allies, but the Luftwaffe had been developed to support Germany's ground forces, had liaison officers with the mobile formations, and operated a higher number of sorties per aircraft. In addition, German air parity or superiority allowed the <b>unencumbered</b> movement of ground forces, their unhindered assembly into concentrated attack formations, aerial reconnaissance, aerial resupply of fast moving formations and close air support at the point of attack. The Allied air forces had no close air support aircraft, training or doctrine. The Allies flew 434 French and 160 British sorties a day but methods of attacking ground targets had yet to be developed; therefore Allied aircraft caused negligible damage. Against these 600 sorties the Luftwaffe on average flew 1,500 sorties a day. On May 13, Fliegerkorps VIII flew 1,000 sorties in support of the crossing of the Meuse. The following day the Allies made repeated attempts to destroy the German pontoon bridges, but German fighter aircraft, ground fire and Luftwaffe flak batteries with the panzer forces destroyed 56 percent of the attacking Allied aircraft while the bridges remained intact.|$|E
