I might even voice the belief that the schizophrenic form of psychic illness is regularly accompanied by illuminating insight into the irrationalism of social and political mores.|$|E
25|$|With the {{adoption}} of such tenets came a succession of Symbolist poems, where {{the focus is on}} minutely-observed objects, usually items of luxury, partly reflecting themes he had explored in the Naturalist stage. Commenting on them, Tudor Vianu argues that no such works had ever been produced in Romanian literature up <b>until</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment.</b> In his Ospățul lui Pentaur ("The Feast of Pentaur"), the poet reflected on civilization itself, as reflected in inanimate opulence. The motif was also developed in descriptive prose fragments later grouped in Cartea de aur, collectively titled nuvele fără oameni ("novellas without people") and compared by Călinescu with the paintings of Theodor Aman.|$|E

The overall lead of the imperial army was taken by Schlik, the commander of the III. corps, ordering at noon a general attack against the Hungarians. <b>Until</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> the Hungarian and the imperial troops had equal numbers (around 14 000 Hungarian troops from the I. and the III. corps against equal numbers of Simunich's besieging army), but the involvement of the III. imperial corps led by Franz Schlik, created a 2-1 Austrian superiority.|$|E

500|$|The {{moment in}} which {{the first half of}} the movie {{transitions}} into the second is punctuated by the rising score and camera pan to an ostensibly meaningless point of reflected light on an ornament. According to Rostock, the meaning behind this movement is clear: it marks the spot when Berti's spree ends and Neal's rampage begins. Argento uses the shift in focus to comment on the shaping of the film itself, <b>until</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> a typical, [...] "clichéd and remote" [...] giallo. Neal, previously passive, begins to control what happens in his own story, which is more personal with [...] "weight and meaning". According to Rostock, this structure allows Argento equal scope to play with the narrative while commenting upon it, all without having to deviate from the advancement of plot. According to Kim Newman, the use of a sculpture as a weapon makes literal one of the themes of the film: [...] "art that kills people". Rostock concurs, saying that as the film is a commentary on art, the only weapon that can end the narrative is art itself.|$|E

500|$|Cisneros {{was awarded}} a {{bachelor}} of arts degree from Loyola University Chicago in 1976, and received a master of fine arts degree from the Iowa Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa in 1978. [...] It was while attending the Workshop that Cisneros discovered how the particular social position she occupied gave her writing a unique potential. She recalls being suddenly struck by the differences {{between her and her}} classmates: [...] "It wasn't as if I didn't know who I was. I knew I was a Mexican woman. But I didn't think it {{had anything to do with}} why I felt so much imbalance in my life, whereas it had everything to do with it! My race, my gender, and my class! And it didn't make sense <b>until</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> sitting in that seminar. That's when I decided I would write about something my classmates couldn't write about." [...] She cast aside her attempt to conform to American literary canons and adopted a writing style that was purposely opposite that of her classmates, realizing that instead of being something to be ashamed of, her own cultural environment was a source of inspiration. From then on, she would write of her [...] "neighbors, the people [...] saw, the poverty that the women had gone through." ...|$|E
500|$|Using his own comitatus, Constantius {{succeeded in}} driving the Alamanni out of Raetia (354), and binding {{the kings of}} {{southern}} Alamannia, Wadomar and Gundomad, with a treaty of alliance. Meanwhile, Silvanus made considerable progress in restoring the situation in Gaul. But the following year (355), Silvanus capitalised on his military success by [...] proclaiming himself emperor at Colonia (Cologne) and leading his men in a rebellion against Constantius. Constantius responded by dispatching to Cologne a flying-squad of protectores domestici (imperial staff-officers), including the future historian Ammianus himself, {{under the command of}} Ursicinus. These swiftly captured and executed Silvanus and prevented a wider mutiny. But the shaken emperor decided that he needed a member of his own imperial dynasty (the House of Constantine, known to the Romans as the Flavii, after Constantine the Great's clan name) to share the burdens of governing the empire. This was a difficult decision for a paranoid ruler who regarded all his relatives with intense suspicion and had already put to death 2 of his uncles and 7 cousins, including Julian's half-brother Constantius Gallus. (Although the House of Constantine was the first Roman imperial dynasty to profess the Christian faith, its internal strife was as ruthless as any of its predecessors). He appointed his cousin Julian as Caesar (deputy emperor) for the [...] "Three Gauls" [...] (the dioceses of Gaul, Spain and Britain) and gave him overall command of forces in Gaul. The appointment was widely seen as unsuitable as Julian, who was just 23 years old, had no military experience and <b>until</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> had spent his time studying philosophy at Athens. But Constantius' own family purges had left him little choice: Julian was his sole surviving adult male close relative.|$|E

If no European ruler would come to rule México, the nation would have the right to elect a ruler amongst its own people. To attract the disparate parties involved in this scheme, the plan offered three guarantees: [...] Mexico would be independent from Madrid, Roman Catholicism would be the official religion, and all inhabitants of the new nation, later México would be considered equals, with no distinction being made between Spaniards, Creoles, Mestizos, etc., thus eliminating the complicated caste system that had been used up <b>until</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> and abolishing the use of slaves in the territory of the new nation as well.|$|E
