The Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke state that Joseph of Arimathea wrapped the body of Jesus {{in a piece of}} <b>linen</b> <b>cloth</b> and placed it in a new tomb.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of the first {{in-depth}} measurements of the <b>linen</b> <b>cloth</b> of the shroud of Arquata, a precious copy of the Shroud of Turin, which dates back to 1653. The measurements aimed at finding the nature of the faint and low-contrast body impressions on the <b>linen</b> <b>cloth,</b> which are not produced by drawings or paintings as in the other copies of the Shroud of Turin. In general, the optical analysis and the imaging of low-contrast stains on ancient textiles is a complex task, due to the irregular surface and the influence of spectrum, position and uniformity of the illuminating source on colour accuracy and rendition. A correct evaluation requires a multidisciplinary approach. We used noninvasive technologies, including imaging topological radar, laser induced fluorescence, absolute diffused reflectance and absorption spectra, which were previously used to study frescoes, paintings, antique papers, but were never exploited on ancient textiles. The combined results of our measurements and data elaboration allowed identifying the origins of the body impressions, of the stains simulating blood and of the other marks embedded on the <b>linen</b> <b>cloth.</b> Our results can be used to plan the proper long-term conservation of the <b>linen</b> <b>cloth</b> and of marks on it...|$|R

50|$|Previously, all Christian Churches used altar cloths. However, today {{some use}} no cloths {{on the altar}} or only the fair linen. Several {{variants}} of the above <b>cloths</b> and <b>linens</b> are also in use. Some Churches use a frontlet and no frontal, especially where the altar is richly decorated and a frontal would hide it. Where only a frontlet is used, {{in many cases the}} frontlet is permanently attached to the <b>linen</b> <b>cloth,</b> and so the <b>linen</b> <b>cloth</b> must be replaced with the frontlet. Many Churches dispense with the cere cloth and the coverlet.|$|R
