5|$|The Bush {{campaign}} advertised {{across the}} <b>U.S.</b> <b>against</b> Democratic candidates, including Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry. Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on the Iraq War, and {{accused him of}} failing {{to stimulate the economy}} and job growth. The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch liberal who would raise taxes and increase the size of government. The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq, and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror.|$|E
5|$|The {{completion}} of Fort Mohave {{began the process}} of military subjugation of the Mohave, and {{the next step was}} the establishment of reservations. In 1863, Charles Debrille Poston, the first Superintendent of Indian Affairs of the Arizona Territory, called a conference between the Chemehuevi and Irataba's faction of the Mohave, in which he convinced them to form an alliance with the <b>US</b> <b>against</b> the Apache. The treaty was never ratified by the US Congress but formed an important step in establishing friendly relations between the Mohave and the US government following the military campaigns and the establishment of Fort Mohave.|$|E
5|$|The first form of {{sanctions}} {{initiated by the}} <b>US</b> <b>against</b> Yugoslavia took place already from 1990 as the Nickels Amendment, which was sponsored by senators Don Nickles and Bob Dole. The amendment was passed due to concerns about Albanians being arrested in Kosovo. The amendment officially came into legal effect from May 6, 1992; although it applied only to $5 million-worth of US foreign aid, it was reported as instrumental in denying SFR Yugoslavia its last application for IMF loans before its breakup and hyperinflation episode.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the 1880s various European {{countries}} had imposed {{a ban on}} importation of United States pork out of an unconfirmed concern of trichinosis; at issue was over one billion pounds of pork products with a value of $80 million (annually). Harrison engaged Whitelaw Reid, minister to France, and William Walter Phelps, minister to Germany, to restore these exports for the country without delay. Harrison also successfully asked the congress to enact the Meat Inspection Act to eliminate the accusations of product compromise. The president also partnered with Agriculture Secretary Rusk to threaten Germany with retaliation – by initiating an embargo in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>against</b> Germany's highly demanded beet sugar. By September 1891 Germany relented, and was soon followed by Denmark, France and Austria-Hungary.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, {{lawsuits}} {{were filed}} in the United States and Ireland, alleging that some priests had sexually abused minors and that their superiors had conspired to conceal and otherwise abet their criminal misconduct.

25|$|Britain soon protested {{with the}} <b>US</b> <b>against</b> {{the use of}} {{submarines}} as merchant ships, arguing {{that they could not}} be stopped and inspected for munitions {{in the same manner as}} other vessels. The US, under diplomatic pressure for supposedly showing favoritism while having declared itself neutral, rejected the argument. Even submarines, as long as they were unarmed, were to be regarded as merchant vessels and accordingly would be permitted to trade.|$|E

25|$|The {{teams of}} Mexico and the United States are widely {{considered}} {{as the two}} major powers of CONCACAF. Matches {{between the two nations}} often attract much media attention, public interest and comment in both countries. Although the first match was played in 1934, their rivalry was not considered major until the 1980s, when the teams began to frequently compete in CONCACAF cups. On August 15, 2012, the United States defeated Mexico at Estadio Azteca in the first victory for the <b>U.S.</b> <b>against</b> Mexico on Mexican soil in 75 years.|$|E
25|$|Following the war, the United States {{government}} {{tried to}} forcibly remove all the Ojibwe to Minnesota, west of the Mississippi River. The Ojibwe resisted, and there were violent confrontations. In the Sandy Lake Tragedy, several hundred Ojibwe died because of the federal government's failure to deliver fall annuity payments. Through the efforts of Chief Buffalo {{and the rise of}} popular opinion in the <b>US</b> <b>against</b> Ojibwe removal, the bands east of the Mississippi were allowed to return to reservations on ceded territory. A few families were removed to Kansas as part of the Potawatomi removal.|$|E

This renewed Cold War fears of Communist expansion in Asia {{at a time when the}} PRC was not recognized by the United States Department of State. Chiang Kai-shek's government was supported by the United States because the ROC was part of the containment of communism which stretched from a devastated South Korea to an increasingly divided Southeast Asia.|$|E
25|$|In April 2006, Harrison {{fought in}} the <b>US</b> <b>against</b> Dominick Guinn and again lost on points. Harrison put the defeat down to loss of {{confidence}} from his defeat to Williams and insisted he would bounce back. In June, he scored a three-round knockout of Andrew Greeley in an off-TV fight in America, and was poised for a fight with Matt Skelton to try to resurrect his career. Skelton had beaten Danny Williams in July, winning the title Williams had earlier taken from Harrison. When Skelton dropped out only one week before the fight due to injury, Danny Williams replaced him.|$|E
