Before PVC can be made into finished products, it always requires conversion into a compound by the incorporation of additives (but not necessarily all of the following) such as heat stabilizers, UV stabilizers, plasticizers, processing aids, impact modifiers, thermal modifiers, fillers, flame retardants, biocides, blowing agents and smoke suppressors, and, optionally, pigments. The choice of additives used for the PVC finished product {{is controlled by the}} cost performance requirements of the end use specification (<b>underground</b> <b>pipe,</b> window frames, intravenous tubing and flooring all have very different ingredients to suit their performance requirements). Previously, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were added to certain PVC products as flame retardants and stabilizers.|$|E
25|$|The Rigole de la plaine carries {{water from}} the Sor tapped from an offtake at Pont Crouzet for {{irrigation}} before emptying into the Canal du Midi. In addition individual samples are collected from the water on the area between Revel and the seuil de Naurouze. In 1980 the Lac de la Ganguise was built near Castelnaudary providing a water reserve of 22 million m3. In 2005 the dam was raised to reach a capacity of 44 million cubic metres. Near the old basin of Naurouze the Naurouze pumping station helps to regulate {{the water in the}} Canal du Midi and the lake. An <b>underground</b> <b>pipe,</b> the gallery of Mandore, provides the Naurouze with additional {{water from the}} Rigole de la plaine to Lake Ganguise. Conversely, during the dry season, Lake Ganguise can supply the Canal du Midi if the water supply of the Rigole de la plaine is not enough.|$|E

2500|$|A full {{investigation}} was launched into the accident by several government agencies, {{as well as}} legal representatives {{for the families of}} the deceased. The investigation determined that the leak was initially discovered by employees of the contractor J.M. Brennan Inc., who helped maintain plumbing, heating, air conditioning and ventilation equipment at the plant. These four employees noticed propane gas pooling as Falk employees started the propane system, which the factory uses as a backup fuel supply when natural gas is shut down during peak demand. These employees alerted other workers to the problem. There had been testing conducted on the system for a full 40minutes prior to the explosion. It is also thought the leak came from an <b>underground</b> <b>pipe</b> that ran from propane tanks to the propane/air mixers, which convert the liquid propane into gaseous form, so that it is in a form usable by the boilers. This is backed up by the discovery of a small pocket of gas trapped below asphalt directly below the Annex building. Pressure testing of the pipe using nitrogen has since confirmed it was leaking. Subsequent excavation showed it had two separate leaks; [...] Metallurgists have examined the damaged sections of pipeline and determined that the pipe corroded. Falk's evacuation procedure will also feature prominently in the investigation.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: To {{overcome}} {{the problems of}} excavation technology for repairing damaged <b>underground</b> <b>pipes,</b> such as sewer pipes, various trenchless (excavation free or no-dig) technologies has been proposed and tried, but they have some drawbacks such as high cost and inconvenience of operation. In this study, the rehabilitation process of <b>underground</b> <b>pipes</b> with glass fiber fabric polymer composites using Resin Transfer Molding (RTM), which overcomes the problems of present trenchless technologies has been developed through the axiomatic design approach. For the reliable and faultless operation, all the problems and situations that may occur during the real construction has been taken into account at every stage of the design process. The developed process requires shorter operation time and lower cost with smaller and simpler operating equipments than conventional trenchless technologies. From the investigation, {{it has been found}} that the developed repair technology with appropriate process parameters determined by design axioms has many advantages over conventional methods.
