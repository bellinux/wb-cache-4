40|$|Two {{eye-tracking}} experiments investigated {{processing of}} <b>unbounded</b> <b>dependency</b> constructions. Experiment 1 employed sentences like That’s the garage/pistol {{with which the}} heartless killer shot the man yesterday afternoon. Readers experienced greater processing difficulty in implausible sen-tences than in plausible sentences immediately after encountering the verb shot. This demonstrated {{that they did not}} wait until the purported gap location after man before forming the <b>unbounded</b> <b>dependency.</b> Experiment 2 considered sentences which locally appear to have an unbounded depen-dency {{that turns out to be}} incorrect.

40|$|This {{book is a}} cross-linguistic {{investigation}} of resumptive pronouns and related phenomena. Pronominal resumption is {{the realization of the}} base of a syntactic dependency as a bound pronoun. Resumption occurs in <b>unbounded</b> <b>dependencies,</b> such as relative clauses and questions, and in the variety of raising known as copy raising. Processing factors may also give rise to resumption, even in environments where it does not normally occur in a given language. A new theory of resumption is proposed that is based on two key assumptions, one theoretical and one empirical/typological. The first assumption is that natural language is resource-sensitive (the Resource Sensitivity Hypothesis); this is captured {{through the use of a}} resource logic for semantic composition. The second assumption is that resumptive pronouns are ordinary pronouns in their morphological and lexical properties, based on typologically robust observations (McCloskey's Generalization). The theory is formalized in terms of Glue Semantics for semantic composition, with a Lexical-Functional Grammar syntax. The theory achieves a novel unification of hitherto heterogeneous resumption phenomena. It unifies two kinds of resumptive pronouns that are found in <b>unbounded</b> <b>dependencies</b> [...] - one kind behaves syntactically like a gap, whereas the other kind does not. It also unifies resumptive pronouns in <b>unbounded</b> <b>dependencies</b> with the obligatory pronouns in copy raising. The theory also provides the basis for a new understanding of processing-based resumption, both in production and in parsing and interpretation...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{deal with}} Negative Concord (NC) in Polish. We show that Polish NC {{is a kind of}} <b>unbounded</b> <b>dependency</b> {{construction}} (UDC), although it differs in many respects from the `standard' UDCs such as, e. g., wh-extraction or topicalization. Our analysis of NC is coached in the theoretical framework of HPSG; more precisely, we adopt a lexicalist approach to UDCs proposed by Sag (1996 a, 1996 b). Moreover, we argue that Polish NC facts would be difficult to model by a purely semantic account. 1 Introduction The aim of this paper is twofold. First, on the basis of facts rarely (if ever) considered in the linguistic literature, we argue for the <b>Unbounded</b> <b>Dependency</b> (UD) status of Negative Concord (NC) in Polish (and, by extension, possibly in other languages exhibiting NC).

40|$|In this thesis, <b>unbounded</b> <b>dependency</b> constructions in Korean will be {{discussed}} within the Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar framework English <b>unbounded</b> <b>dependency</b> constructions, that is, relative clauses, and topic clauses will be compared to Korean counterparts. Korean wh-interrogatives are not investigated as they are not syntactic dependency constructions we have adopted in this thesis. The wh-words and the constituents in question occupy the same places, that is, whwords are in situ. There {{is some kind of}} dependencies between wh-elements and the interrogative suffixes. This is a semantic dependency between wh-elements and its scope. One might assume topic clauses are unbounded dependencies but they are not in three reasons. First, the LOCAL value of the missing constituent is not identical to that of the topic. Second, topic clauses with no gap exist. Third, a gap can appear without topic. Topic clauses will be generated anyway without a SLASH mechanism. For these reasons, it follows that topic and gap are not syntactically connected. Korean topic clause constructions are neither filler-gap construction proposed by Pollard and Sag (1994) nor adjunction suggested by Gunji (1987). The left-dislocation in Catalan analysed by Engdahl and Vallduvi (1996) in Information Packaging could be more satisfactory. But English as for construction is more like Korean topic clause constructions. Unlike, topic clauses and wh-interrogatives, Korean relative clauses are real unbounded dependencies. An important piece of evidence is that missing constituents can be embedded deeply and the relative suffix nun is in the highest verb next the head noun. This is similar to missing constituent and relative pronouns in English relative clauses. Unlike externally-headed relative clauses, internally-headed relative clauses are not real relative clauses in two reasons: internally-headed relative clauses do not stem from those of nun-marked verbs and they are not modifiers as only a single IHRC can combine with kus...|$|E
40|$|Categorial Grammar {{comprises}} {{a family}} of lexicalized theories of grammar characterized by very tight coupling of syntactic derivation and semantic composition, having their origin {{in the work of}} Frege. Some ver-sions of CG have extremely restricted expressive power, corresponding to the smallest known natural family of formal languages that properly in-cludes the context-free. Nevertheless, they are also strongly adequate to the capture {{of a wide range of}} cross-linguistically attested non-context-free constructions. For these reasons, categorial grammars have been quite widely applied, not only to linguistic analysis of challenging phenomena such as coordination and <b>unbounded</b> <b>dependency,</b> but to computational lin-guistics and psycholinguistic modeling. 1.

40|$|Concord {{adverbial}} constructions in Korean show <b>unbounded</b> <b>dependency</b> {{relationships between}} two non-empty entities. There {{are two different}} types of unboundedness involved: one between a concord adverbial and a verbal ending and the other between the adverbial as a modifier and a predicate. In addition, these unboundedness relationships exhibit properties of “downward movement ” phenomena. In this paper, we examine the Indexed Phrase Structure Grammar analysis of the constructions presented in Chae (2003, 2004), and propose to introduce a new feature to solve its conceptual problem. Then, we provide an analysis of conditional-concessive constructions, which is a subtype of concord adverbial constructions. These constructions are special {{in the sense that they}} contain a seemingly incompatible combination of a conditional adverbial and a concessive verbal ending.
