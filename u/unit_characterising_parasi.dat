40|$|The present {{article is}} devoted to the {{investigation}} of the functioning of English generally marked phraseological units in the texts of belle–lettre style literature. The subject of investigation — English phraseological <b>units,</b> <b>characterising</b> men and women, i. e. generally marked phraseologies of the English language. The aim of the research is analysis and classification of English generally marked phraseological units in the original texts of belle–lettre style literature, classifying them into definite groups, characterising age, appearance, marital and social status, traits of character, professional sphere and nationality of men and women. This investigation was done with the help of method of overall selection from English phraseological (idiomatic) dictionaries, a method of classification of gender-marked phraseologies and componential analysis, making out gender component in the structure of gender-marked phraseological units. As the result, there were presented separate semantic groups of generally marked phraseological <b>units,</b> <b>characterising</b> age categories, peculiarities of appearance, professional and personal qualities, the marital and social status of men and women. The theoretical part of the article is proved by short extracts from English belle–lettre literature texts. The results of the research can be used not only in practical learning of English phraseological units but in the process of interpretation of belle–lettre literature texts, in working over idiomatic dictionaries and linguistic analysis of characters of belle–lettre literature as well...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: It is {{generally}} unknown how to formally determine whether different neural networks {{have a similar}} behaviour. This question intimately relates {{to the problem of}} finding a suitable sim-ilarity measure to identify bounds on the input-output response dis-tances of neural networks, which has several interesting theoretical and computational implications. For example, it can allow one to speed up the learning processes by restricting the network parameter space, or to test the robustness of a network with respect to param-eter variation. In this paper we develop a procedure that allows to compare neural structures among them. In particular, we con-sider dynamic networks composed of neural <b>units</b> <b>characterised</b> by non-linear differential equations, described in terms of autonomous continuous dynamic systems. The comparison is established by im-porting and adapting from the formal verification setting the concept of δ−approximate bisimulations techniques for non-linear systems.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of deformation patterns during thrust-related folding is {{of importance for}} both industrial and academic purposes because of the control that it exerts on the migration and accumulation of fluids in reservoirs. The link between structural position and deformation pattern has been described in both theoretical and field works. On the other hand, the well-documented dependence of deformation structures on the mechanical rock properties and on the environmental conditions indicates that, during folding, structural, stratigraphic, and environmental variables interact to control the deformation pattern within folds. In this work we describe the deformation pattern of the Mt. Catria anticline (Northern Apennines, Italy) and we investigate its variability with (1) the across-strike structural position, and (2) the rock type in the same structural position. Point (1) allowed us to identify and use the syn-folding deformation structures to constrain the fold kinematics. The result of point (2) analyses allowed us to divide the exposed Umbro-Marchean multilayer into three major mechanical <b>units</b> <b>characterised</b> by specific deformation mechanisms and patterns...|$|R

The reconstruction of assemblage formation was rather complicated, but the high number of fragments, the occurrence of typical macrofracture patterns and the rejuvenated implements shed light to the human behaviour. Finally a few pieces with sufficient preservation allow us to point some details to the operational chain of the osseous tool production. All these aspects of the assemblage were determined by the topographic location of the cave, lying at a large relative height by the end of a long and deep valley, determining the nature of the human occupation of this locality.

40|$|An {{important}} detachment {{is described}} in the allochthonous Ordenes Complex, in the NW Iberian Massif, and its meaning {{is related to the}} kinematics of contemporaneous convergent structures. The Corredoiras Detachment (CD) separates a hangingwall <b>unit,</b> <b>characterised</b> by a medium-pressure metamorphic gradient, from a footwall high-pressure and hightemperature unit and an underlying ophiolitic unit. An associated ductile shear zone, nearly 2000 m thick, developed in {{the lower part of the}} hangingwall unit, where the Corredoiras Orthogneiss, a Lower Ordovician metagranite, was progressively transformed into augengneisses, mylonitic and ultramylonitic gneisses. The attitude of the stretching and mineral lineation in the mylonites varies due to late refolding at map scale, but the sense of movement can be estimated, being roughly top to the SE. According to crosscutting relationships, the CD developed subsequent to the thrusting of the high-pressure/high-temperature unit onto the ophiolitic unit, and prior to younger extensional detachments, upright folding and strike-slip tectonics. The geometric relationships of the CD with the previous structures in the footwall unit, the subtractive character of the metamorphic gap between its hangingwall and footwall, and the available isotopic data suggest that the CD is an early Variscan, ductile extensional detachment, the movement of which was roughly simultaneous with the onset of thrusting of the allochthonous complexes over their relative autochthon...|$|R

40|$|Background Phase change {{materials}} (PCMs) {{have been}} proposed {{as a means to}} increase the thermal inertia of glazing systems. These materials have optical features that need to be investigated and characterised in order to better understand the potential of these systems and to provide reliable data for numerical simulations. Methods The spectral and angular behaviour of different PCM glazing samples, characterised by different thicknesses of PCMs, were investigated by means of commercial spectrophotometer and by means of a dedicated optical test bed that includes a large integrating sphere with a diameter of 0. 75 m. Such equipment was necessary because of the highly diffusive behaviour of the PCM layer when in the solid state of aggregation. Results The paper provides a data set of luminous and solar properties of glazing units with PCMs in gaps; the data set uses results from an advanced optical facility that overcomes the intrinsic limitations of commercial spectrophotometers in measuring the optical properties of the advanced transparent materials.

40|$|The North Cape massif {{consists}} of a semi-conformable sequence of serpentinite, gabbro, sheeted sill and dike units, and pillow lavas. Although structurally disrupted, they can be interpreted {{in terms of an}} idealised ophiolite sequence and represent the most complete sequence in the Northland Ophiolite. Their age is considered to be Late Cretaceous - Paleocene on the basis of microfossils in associated sediments. Early Miocene K-Ar ages from igneous rocks are thought to reflect the time of emplacement as a thrust sheet of oceanic crust and upper mantle. The gabbros are divided into a lower <b>unit</b> <b>characterised</b> by well-developed cumulate layering and an upper unit which is massive; the sheeted sills and dikes are quartz-diorite and microgabbro interleaved with minor pillow lava. Two phases of alteration are observed, a pervasive low-grade greenschist metamorphism attributed to sea-water interaction after formation as oceanic crust, and an overprinting zeolitic alteration which is possibly post-emplacement. Their tholeiitic nature as well as overlapping geochemical compositions suggest that the gabbros and sheeted dikes and sills represent ditferent components of a single magmatic system related by simple fractionation processes. Several lines of evidence suggest that the magmas that formed the North Cape gabbro and sheeted intrusives have subduction-related chemical characteristics. In the gabbro, calcic plagioclase (An) and depleted Zr and Y abundances, and in the sheeted intrusives depleted high field strength element abundances relative to typical MORB, is indicative of a subduction signature. The presence of subduction- 2 ̆ 7 elated characteristics within the Northland Ophiolite suggests that it may have originated at a back-arc basin rather than a major ocean ridge spreading centre...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{original}} {{formulation of}} the (weak) anthropic principle was prompted by a question about objective time at a macroscopic level, namely {{the age of the}} universe when “anthropic ” observers such as ourselves would be most likely to emerge. Theoretical interpretation of what one observes requires the theory to indicate what is expected, which will commonly depend on where, and particularly when, the observation can be expected to occur. In response to the question of where and when, the original version of the anthropic principle proposed an it a priori probability weighting proportional to the number of “anthropic” observers present. The present discussion takes up the question of the time <b>unit</b> <b>characterising</b> the biological clock controlling our subjective internal time, using a revised alternative to a line of argument due to Press, who postulated that animal size is limited by the brittleness of bone. On the basis of a static support condition depending on the tensile strength of flesh rather than bone, it is reasoned here that our size should be subject to a limit inversely proportional to the surface gravitation field g, which is itself found to be proportional (with a factor given by the 5 / 2 power of the fine structure constant) to the gravitational coupling constant. This provides an animal size limit that will in all cases be of the order of a thousandth of the maximum mountain height, which will itself be of the order of a thousandth of the planetary radius. The upshot, via the (strong) anthropic principle, is that the need for brains, and therefore planets, that are large in terms of baryon number may be what explains the weakness of gravity relative to electromagnetism. 1 1 Introduction: fundamenta...|$|R

Here we present a detailed interpretation of depositional environments from a new 30 -metre long borehole in the central North Sea, {{with the aim of}} improving {{constraints on}} the history of the marine Late Pleistocene British–Fennoscandian Ice Sheet. Seven <b>units</b> <b>characterise</b> a sequence of compacted and distorted glaciomarine diamictons, which are overlain by interbedded glaciomarine diamictons and soft, bedded to homogeneous marine muds. Through correlation of borehole and 2 D/ 3 D seismic observations, we identify three palaeo-regimes. These are: a period of advance and ice-sheet overriding; a phase of deglaciation; and a phase of postglacial glaciomarine-to-marine sedimentation. Deformed subglacial sediments correlate with a buried suite of streamlined subglacial bedforms, and indicate overridding by the SE–NW-flowing Witch Ground ice-stream. AMS 14 C dating confirms ice-stream activity and extensive glaciation of the North Sea during the Last Glacial Maximum, between c. 30 and 16. 2 14 C ka BP. Sediments overlying the ice-compacted deposits have been reworked, but can be used to constrain initial deglaciation to no later than 16. 2 14 C ka BP. A re-advance of British ice during the last deglaciation, dated at 13. 9 14 C ka BP, delivered ice-proximal deposits to the core site and deposited glaciomarine sediments rapidly during the subsequent retreat. A transition to more temperate marine conditions is clear in lithostratigraphic and seismic records, marked by a regionally-pervasive iceberg-ploughmarked erosion surface. The iceberg discharges that formed this horizon are dated to between 13. 9 and 12 14 C ka BP, and may correspond to oscillating ice-sheet margins during final, dynamic ice-sheet decay...|$|R

40|$|Quebrada (stream) Ñuagapua, {{which is}} located in the Bolivian Chaco in the Andean {{foothill}} generates an alluvial fan many kilometres in length. Three major lithostratigraphic <b>units</b> <b>characterise</b> the sedimentary sequence in this region. The lower and upper parts are formed from predominantly sandy sediments that demonstrate rapid growth of the alluvial fan, associated with an intense erosion of barren slopes. The intermediate unit consists of forest soil that seals deep channels containing bones together with a forest association. The remains of a wooden plank, dated 140 yr BP, were found {{at the top of this}} soil, which laterally contains charcoals, ash layers and large charred trunks, sometimes in growth positions. Roots localised in this layer also sustain a number of very large still living trees. These findings are evidence of a recent phase of alluvial fan sedimentation resulting from slope erosion activated by forest clearing. The Chaco has been intensively settled for agricultural and pastoral purposes since the 18 th century. The lower unit contains a hearth, scattered burnt bones, flint flakes and ceramic artefacts. Radiometric dating indicates a middle Holocene human occupation, between ca. 7. 79 and 6. 65 ka cal yr BP. We suggest that the sedimentary unit is associated with intense soil erosion processes triggered by early Neolithic deforestation. A sandy layer of the lower unit, slightly above the archaeological remains, contains transported bones of megafaunal elements that apparently represent the South American latest occurrence of some extinct taxa. The mammal association is highly heterogeneous, containing species living in aquatic, forest, prairie and savannah environments from a very specific layer that represents the almost simultaneous burial of animals killed slightly up-valley. This anomalous association is probably the result of human impact as opening the forest favoured the introduction of open environment fauna that had previously survived on the southernmost part of the continent. Therefore, humans may have played a role in mammalian extinctions in this region, either directly, due to hunting, or due to changing the paleoenvironmental conditions on a wider scale...|$|R

The upshot, via the (strong) anthropic principle, is that the need for brains, and therefore planets, that are large in terms of baryon number may be what explains the weakness of gravity relative to electromagnetism.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{draws on}} videotapes of {{mathematics}} lessons prepared and conducted by pre-service elementary teachers {{towards the end}} of their initial training at one university. The aim was to locate ways in which they drew on their knowledge of mathematics and mathematics pedagogy in their teaching. A grounded approach to data analysis led to the identification of a ‘knowledge quartet’, with four broad dimensions, or ‘units’, through which mathematics-related knowledge of these begin-ning teachers could be observed in practice. We term the four units: foundation, transformation, connection and contingency. This paper describes how each of these <b>units</b> is <b>characterised</b> and analyses one of the videotaped lessons, showing how each dimension of the quartet can be identified in the lesson. We claim that the quartet {{can be used as a}} framework for lesson observation and for mathematics teaching devel-opment.

40|$|Financing {{the public}} health system {{represents}} a central reference point of the decisional algorithm necessary for ensuring an advanced management, {{in the sense that}} the purpose of this tactic is to analyse the current financial management, to formulate some observations and to present some authorised recommendations from the experts in the health domain, who could introduce a redesign of the managerial decisions in sanitary <b>units</b> organization, <b>characterised</b> by an institutional culture which is refractory to the changes imposed by hospital services rationalization. The methodological approach of this paper, far from being exhaustive, is based on the analysis of the medical system, with emphasis on financing the medical care services. The evaluation is done by using some technical research instruments, as well as by processing some data with public character available on the official sites of Romanian public institutions, data that provide reliable information, valid for the analysed reference system...|$|R
40|$|In 1995, three censuses {{were carried}} out to assess the {{importance}} of the coastal seiners fleet of the north coast of the Java Island. According to these three censuses (March, June and November), the number of the coastal seiners varies from 1, 580 to 1, 660. The spatial distribution of the fishing <b>units</b> is <b>characterised</b> by an increasing gradient from the west to the east of the Java Island. During each census, some technical characteristics were recorded. Inside this fleet, two main opposites are described : the first depends on the level of the technical characterisation (type of the fishing aggregating device, differentiated holds); the second is linked to the ability to migrate along the north coast of the Java Island (shape of boat, motorization). So, a first image of the dynamic of this fleet is outlined thanks to the different results. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|The Falterona-Vicchio {{succession}} outcropping in the Alta Val Marecchia area, shows peculiar stratigraphic and tectonic {{characters with}} respect to the Casentino to the northwest. Since the Aquitanian, the sedimentation of the Falterona Formation (a turbidite <b>unit)</b> is <b>characterised,</b> in the study area, by pelitic dominant lithofacies and reduced thickness. Lower Miocene volcanoclastic and cherty levels occur near the villages of Viamaggio and Caprile. New well data show the presence of volcanic rocks of the same age in an adjacent area to the southwest. A stratigraphic gap associated with an abrupt sedimentary facies change is documented in the sequence. Lower-Middle Serravallian pelitic-sandy to pelitic lithofacies closely resemble those of the Verghereto Marls cropping in northwestern sector of the study area. This suggests a connection between the Tuscan Domain and the more external Umbro-Marchean-Romagnan Domain of the Apennine foredeep, along an important transversal tectonic discontinuity corresponding to the Val Marecchia "Line'...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Neumann {{operator}} is {{an operator}} on {{the boundary of}} a smooth manifold which maps the boundary value of a harmonic function to its normal derivative. In this paper, the Neumann operator on the boundary of smooth, bounded, simply connected planar domains is studied. The asymptotics of the eigenvalues are computed. The regularised zeta function for the Neumann operator at z = − 2 is computed. Study of the zeta function is then used {{to show that the}} <b>unit</b> disk is <b>characterised</b> by the spectrum of its Neumann operator...|$|R
50|$|In 1970 the Commando began Arctic {{training}} for the first time, taking {{on the role of}} Britain’s mountain and Arctic warfare experts (joined later by the other Commandos). 45 Cdo RM deployed to Norway for the first of many winters in 1971, which coincided with a move of the unit from Stonehouse, Plymouth to the old Naval Air Station, RNAS Arbroath (now RM Condor) in Arbroath, Scotland, where the unit still remains. This period in the <b>unit’s</b> history is <b>characterised</b> by the alternation of Northern Ireland tours and winters in Norway, protecting NATO’s northern flank.|$|R
