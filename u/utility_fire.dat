50|$|The Wildcat {{featured}} {{an increased}} payload and range over the preceding Super Lynx; it is operationally required {{to carry up}} to 8 Future Anti-Surface Guided Weapons up to 185 kilometers from a host ship and remain on station for up to an hour. The type can perform aerial reconnaissance, anti-submarine warfare (ASW), anti-surface warfare (ASuW), <b>utility,</b> <b>fire</b> control, command and control, and troop transport duties. In these varied mission roles, a range of munitions can be used. In June 2014, the Royal Navy awarded Thales Group a £48 million contract to deliver the Lightweight Multirole Missile (Martlet) for the Wildcat under the Future Anti-Surface Guided Weapons Light (FASGW (L)) programme for targets such as small boats and fast attack craft. A Wildcat can carry four launchers each with five Martlets. In March 2014 a contract was awarded to MBDA for the Sea Venom (FASGW Heavy) missile for use against vessels and land targets, replacing the Sea Skua. Both missiles are being integrated by AgustaWestland in a single £90m programme by 2018, with IOC for both planned by October 2020.|$|E
40|$|Fire in the {{tropical}} savannas of northern Australia is frequent and extensive, management is a continuous and iterative process. The remote sensed mapping of fire and its effects can be returned to managers quickly and cost effectively. The post-fire measure of the affect of fire on vegetation is defined here as fire severity. This study developed a method of calibrating remotely sensed imagery for mapping fire severity. It coupled helicopter-based spectra and comprehensive ground measurements. Data were modelled against a fire severity index, the metrics of which were previously developed in collaboration with land managers. The differenced normalised burn ratio (ΔNBR) {{was determined to be}} the best of a candidate set of models to separate severe from not-severe fire effects. Other models were assessed to discriminate low from moderate fire severity, the most parsimonious model used the shortwave infrared band at 1640 nm. The reflectance models were applied to a time series of images from the MODIS sensor for the fire season of 2009 and assessed against validation data. Image differences were within 5 to 6 days, as a pre-determined window of algorithm applicability. Overall accuracy discriminating severe from not-severe fires was 94 %. Discrimination within the not-severe category was only 60 % due mostly to image availability in MODIS channel 6 and the coarseness of validation data. As an outcome a fire severity mapping product, initially discriminating severe from not-severe fires, will be made available through the North Australian Fire Information mapping system to enhance its <b>utility.</b> <b>Fire</b> severity mapping will improve the ability of land managers to monitor the effects of fires and undertake strategic fire management planning. It will provide conservation land managers with greater parametric detail to more effectively assess fire effects on ecological communities, and it will improve the precision of greenhouse gas emissions calculations...|$|E

30|$|From {{investigations}} into the Tsetse-fly problem in East Africa, it seems that under suitable conditions of vegetation, season, and current aerial conditions, fires in the Tree-and-Grass Savannas act beneficially in that they either reduce or entirely destroy undergrowth and small thickets in which the Tsetse-flies (e.g., Glossina morsitans and G. swynnertoni) deposit their larvae. The larvae rapidly pupate. Should the vegetation cover be destroyed, {{not only are the}} puparial accumulations of many months destroyed, but also the breeding grounds for the future.

It grew from a popular rest stop for travelers during the Gold Rush of the late 1850s to an agricultural and suburban community known as the “Carnation City” in the mid 1900s. As the residential areas of unincorporated Jefferson County grew to provide housing to the Denver workforce during the 1950s, the major transportation corridors extending from Denver developed with commercial services.

It is no longer being maintained and the data it contains may no longer be current and/or accurate. The Hazardous Substances Emergency Events Surveillance (HSEES) system, maintained by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), actively collects information to describe the public health consequences of acute releases of hazardous substances in 15 states. This report summarizes the characteristics of events reported to ATSDR by all participating state health departments in 2004. Information about acute events involving hazardous substances was collected, including the substance(s) released, number of victims, number and types of injuries, and number of evacuations. The data were computerized using an ATSDR-provided Web-based data entry system. A total of 7, 744 events was reported. In 6, 835 (88. 3 %) events, only one substance was released. The most commonly reported categories of substances were other inorganic substances (excluding chemicals in the categories of acids, bases, ammonia, and chlorine), volatile organic compounds, and mixtures involving substances from different categories that were mixed or formed from a reaction before release. During this reporting period, 620 events (8. 0 % of all reported events) resulted in a total of 1, 838 victims, 41 of whom (2. 4 %) died. The most frequently reported injuries were respiratory irritation, headaches, and dizziness/central nervous system symptoms. Evacuations were ordered for 499 (6. 4 %) events. Findings regarding the percentage of events involving victims and the distribution of types of injuries reported have been consistent in recent years. Topics targeted in 2004 included 1) disaster preparedness, 2) methamphetamine lab awareness activities, 3) outreach to specific groups using ammonia, chlorine, cleaning products, acids, and mercury, 4) outreach to targeted populations including children, responders, the transportation industry, and 5) special interest topics including carbon monoxide poisonings from underground <b>utility</b> <b>fires</b> and exposure to tearing agents from theft deterrent devices...|$|R
