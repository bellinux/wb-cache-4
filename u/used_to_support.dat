5|$|Buildings in Chamba were {{traditionally}} constructed using local materials. Buildings {{were made}} out of dry stone masonry, with the walls and floors of the older houses plastered with a concoction of clay and cow-dung. Thick wooden beams were <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> the walls, paying attention to durability and to withstand earthquakes, and wooden cantilever construction was often <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> the verandas. The staircases and doors were made from wood, with the doors often decorated in religious reliefs and flanked by two lamps to light it at night. Before {{the arrival of the}} British, who introduced slate roofs to Chamba, roofs were covered with planks, coated in clay. Few of these houses remain today, although a number still have wood-clay roofs in villages in the suburbs.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} half of the century several castles were maintained, or brought back into {{military}} use. During the Irish War of Independence Dublin Castle remained the centre of the British administration, military and intelligence operations in Ireland until the transfer of power and the castle to the Irish Free State in 1922. During the Second World War the Tower of London was used to hold and execute suspected spies, and was used to briefly detain Rudolf Hess, Adolf Hitler's deputy, in 1941. Edinburgh Castle was used as a prisoner of war facility, while Windsor Castle was stripped of more delicate royal treasures and used to guard the British royal family from the dangers of the Blitz. Some coastal castles were <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> naval operations: Dover Castle's medieval fortifications used as basis for defences across the Dover Strait; Pitreavie Castle in Scotland was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> the Royal Navy; and Carrickfergus Castle in Ireland was used as a coastal defence base. Some castles, such as Cambridge and Pevensey, were brought into local defence plans in case of a German invasion. A handful of these castles retained a military role after the war; Dover was used as a nuclear war command centre into the 1950s, while Pitreavie was used by NATO until the turn of the 21st century.|$|E

5|$|Opposition to the dam project also {{arose in}} {{concern of the}} dam's cost. Several United States congressmen and fiscal conservatives protested the {{proposal}} {{on the grounds that}} the money that would be spent on its construction would be better <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> other projects. They pointed to the lack of existing infrastructure in the region and said it was unlikely that enough electricity generated by the dam could be sold at a high enough price to pay for its construction.|$|E

5|$|The RTV-A-2 Hiroc (high-altitude rocket) was the United States' {{first attempt}} at an {{intercontinental}} ballistic missile (ICBM). The project was initially under the name MX-774, however the project was canceled in 1947, and leftover funds were used to build and launch three missiles, which were renamed to RTV-A-2 Hiroc. The design included several innovations; the gimballed engine provided guidance control, the internal gas pressure was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> the airframe and the nose cap was separable. All of these concepts were later used on the Atlas missile.|$|E

5|$|As early Homo sapiens {{began to}} diversify the {{ecological}} zones that they inhabited during the MSA, {{the archaeological record}} associated with these zones begins to show evidence for regional continuities. These continuities are significant {{for a number of}} reasons. The expansion of Homo sapiens into various ecological zones demonstrates an ability to adapt to a variety of environmental contexts including marine environments, savanna grasslands, relatively arid deserts, and forests. This adaptability is reflected in MSA artifacts found in these zones. These artifacts display stylistic variability depending on zone. During the Acheulian, which spanned from 1.5 million years ago to 300 thousand years ago, lithic technology displayed incredible homogeneity throughout all ecological niches. MSA technologies, with their evidence for regional variability and continuity, represent a remarkable advance. These data have been <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> theories of social and stylistic development throughout the MSA.|$|E
5|$|Australia also formed {{small-scale}} raiding and reconnaissance forces, most {{of which}} were grouped together as the Allied Intelligence Bureau. Z Special Unit conducted raids far behind the front line, including a successful raid on Singapore in September 1943. M Special Unit, coastwatchers and smaller AIB units also operated behind Japanese lines to collect intelligence. AIB parties were often <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> Australian Army units and were assigned to inappropriate tasks such as tactical reconnaissance and liaison. AIB missions in Timor and Dutch New Guinea were also hampered by being placed under the command of unpopular Dutch colonial administrators. The RAAF formed a specially-equipped unit (No.200Flight) in 1945 to support these operations by transporting and supplying AIB parties in areas held by the Japanese.|$|E
