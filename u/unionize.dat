5|$|Leaders of AASEREA {{continued}} {{a campaign}} to <b>unionize</b> public transportation companies in American cities. The Indianapolis Street Railway Company, a smaller transportation company, did <b>unionize</b> in 1899 when its employees {{became part of the}} Amalgamated Association of Street and Electric Railway Employees of America (AASEREA). After a series of successful AASEREA supported strikes, the latest in Cincinnati, Ohio during May 1913, the union leaders turned their attention back to Indianapolis.|$|E

40|$|In a two-country reciprocal-dumping model, {{with one}} country <b>unionized,</b> we analyse how wage setting and firm {{location}} {{are influenced by}} trade liberalization. We show that trade liberalization can induce a <b>unionized</b> firm to move all production abroad. This cannot prevail in a corresponding, non-unionized model. Trade liberalization has a non-monotonic effect on wages. For a given location choice, trade liberalization increases national welfare in the <b>unionized</b> country. When a shift of some or all production to the foreign country occurs, national welfare can be reduced. foreign direct investments; trade liberalization; <b>unionized</b> oligopoly...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} determination of <b>unionized</b> wage {{in the presence of}} both collective bargaining and efficiency wage. The efficiency of each worker is positively related to both the wage and the unemployment rate in the economy. The <b>unionized</b> wage is greater than the efficiency wage. The firm finds it profitable to keep the <b>unionized</b> wage {{as close as possible to}} the efficiency wage. The union leader who is entrusted with the task of determining the <b>unionized</b> wage charges a bribe from the firm to keep the wage close to this level. The corrupt trade union leader and the management of the firm play a two-stage Nash bargaining game from where equilibrium <b>unionized</b> wage and the bribe are determined. The analysis leads to some interesting results which are important for anticorruption policy formulation. ...|$|R
5|$|After {{the events}} of November 1, the Terminal and Traction Company hired 300 {{professional}} strikebreakers from the Pinkerton Agency in Chicago to operate the streetcars.

5|$|Generally {{a friend}} of {{organized}} labor, Chandler supported miners' efforts to <b>unionize,</b> organized the state Department of Industrial Relations, and prohibited mine operators from being appointed as deputy sheriffs. He also endorsed the proposed Child Labor Amendment to the federal constitution and secured passage of a state anti-child-labor law {{that had previously been}} defeated twice in the state legislature by overwhelming margins. However, he opposed closed shops and sitdown strikes, and utilized the Kentucky National Guard to quell labor-related violence in Harlan County.|$|E

40|$|The authors analyze youthâ€“adult unionization {{differences}} {{by using the}} National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY 79) to follow a single cohort of individuals from the ages of 15 / 16 to 40 / 41. They find that the differences between youth and adults are greatest at ages 15 to 17 and largely disappear {{by the age of}} 23. Though currently <b>unionized</b> workers {{are most likely to be}} in their forties or fifties, research also demonstrates that younger workers have a greater opportunity or are more inclined to be <b>unionized</b> than adults and that many individuals report having had a <b>unionized</b> job by the age of 25.

5|$|John J. Thorpe, vice {{president}} of AASEREA led the renewed unionization effort, and he {{and a group of}} men traveled to Indianapolis. Drawing support from union employees of the Indianapolis Street Railway Company, Thorpe began a campaign to <b>unionize</b> the employees of the Traction and Terminal Company in August 1913. The 900 non-union employees of the Traction and Terminal Company were generally paid much less and worked longer hours than the union workers of the smaller transportation company, and Thorpe considered them to be a prime target for the union organizing attempt.|$|E
5|$|On May 25, 2001, {{the print}} edition {{announced}} {{the sale of}} the Washington Blade to Window Media, LLC, a group of gay publications. With the new ownership came several changes to standardize the paper with other Window Media publications, such as the return of editorials to the publication after being missing for several decades. Shortly after {{the sale of the}} paper, staff at the Blade sought a vote to <b>unionize</b> {{with the help of the}} Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild. The Guild and the staff of the Blade brought a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board and deliberated for a few weeks over this issue resulting in a ten to eight vote against unionization on July 20, 2001.|$|E
5|$|Following his defeat, Patton {{returned}} to Pike County. In 1989 he was re-elected {{for a third}} term as judge/executive, receiving over 70percent {{of the vote in}} a three-way Democratic primary and subsequently winning the general election by nearly a three-to-one margin. He immediately began preparing for another run for lieutenant governor in 1991. In the earlier campaign, the UMWA had been vociferously opposed to Patton because employees in his coal mines had been affiliated with the Southern Labor Union. Skipper Martin introduced him to Teamsters leaders, and Patton worked with them to <b>unionize</b> Pike County employees. He also worked with Kelsey Friend to pass the Kentucky Rural Economic Development Act, a measure giving financial incentives to companies that located in economically depressed rural counties.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} effects of {{international}} integration of product and capital markets (i. e., globalisation) {{in a world where}} countries differ in their labour market institutions: one country has a perfectly competitive labour market while the other is <b>unionized.</b> We show that workers should favour autarky in the <b>unionized</b> country, but oppose it in the non <b>unionized</b> country. Vice versa for owners of capital. Aggregate gains from integration, however, are negative. We also show that, under capital mobility an increase in relative bargaining power of unions does not always improve workers' welfare: there is a critical level of bargaining strength above which an increase in union power reduces workers' income in the <b>unionized</b> country.

5|$|Senator Robert F. Wagner {{proposed}} the National Labor Relations Act in 1935, which empowered workers to <b>unionize.</b> Ironically, the ACLU, after 15 years of fighting for workers' rights, initially opposed the act (it later took no {{stand on the}} legislation) because some ACLU leaders feared the increased power the bill gave to the government. The newly formed National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) posed a dilemma for the ACLU, because in 1937 it issued an order to Henry Ford, prohibiting Ford from disseminating anti-union literature. Part of the ACLU leadership habitually took the side of labor, and that faction supported the NLRB's action. But part of the ACLU supported Ford's right to free speech. ACLU leader Arthur Garfield Hays proposed a compromise (supporting the auto workers union, yet also endorsing Ford's right to express personal opinions), but the schism highlighted a deeper divide that would become more prominent {{in the years to}} come.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1926, Hu Lanqi left home for Guangzhou to work for He Xiangning, Minister of Women's Affairs of the Kuomintang (KMT) government. The {{following}} year, she became a cadet of the Whampoa Military Academy in Wuhan and enlisted in the KMT's National Revolutionary Army, which was then waging the Northern Expedition against the warlords. She {{was one of a}} small number of women recruits, which included Xie Bingying and Zhao Yiman. After initial success, the KMT leader Chiang Kai-shek turned against the Communists, who had been until then allied with the KMT, and committed the Shanghai massacre in April 1927. The Wuhan-based left wing of the KMT, who were sympathetic to the Communists, capitulated to Chiang's right wing. Hu Lanqi was discharged from the army when the military academy was dissolved in July 1927. Instead of returning home, she continued to work for the left-wing KMT leader He Xiangning, helping her <b>unionize</b> female workers. She broke up with her second husband whose political views differed from hers.|$|E
