5|$|Fred Phillips, the {{original}} designer of Spock's Vulcan ears, served as The Motion Pictures makeup artist. He {{and his staff}} were responsible for fifty masks and makeup for the aliens seen in the film. The designs were developed by Phillips himself or else off Fletcher's sketches. In his long association with Star Trek Phillips produced his 2000th Spock ear during production of The Motion Picture. Each ear was made of latex and other ingredients blended together in a kitchen mixer, then baked for six hours. Though Phillips had saved {{the original}} television series casts used for making the appliances, Nimoy's ears had grown in the decade since and new molds had to be fabricated. While {{on the small screen}} the ears could be used up to four times, since nicks and tears did not show up on television, Phillips had to create around three pairs a day for Nimoy during filming. The <b>upswept</b> Vulcan eyebrows needed to be applied hair by hair for proper detail, and it took Nimoy more than two hours to prepare for filming—twice as long as it had for television.|$|E

25|$|In 1986 the West of England Main Line {{came under}} the control of the Network SouthEast (NSE) sector, which saw the {{introduction}} of their bright blue, red and white livery. The first locomotive in this livery was again 50023 Howe. The NSE livery had two versions; the original had <b>upswept</b> red and white stripes and the ends, with a white cab surround; the revised livery introduced in 1988 had the red and white stripes continue to the body ends, with a blue cab surround. In the revised livery the blue became a darker shade.|$|E
25|$|The DH.6 was {{specifically}} {{designed as a}} military trainer, {{at a time when}} it was usual for obsolete service types to be used in this role. Geoffrey de Havilland seems to have had two design criteria in mind. The first was that it should be inexpensive and easy to build, and above all, simple to repair after the mishaps common in training units. The top and bottom wings were square-cut and interchangeable, hence roundels often located in unusual positions. They were heavily cambered, and braced with cables rather than streamlined wires. On the original version of the type there was no stagger. Even the fin and rudder, on the prototype of the usual curved de Havilland outline, were cut square on production machines. The fuselage structure was a straight box with no attempt at refinement of outline – instructor and pupil sat in tandem on basketwork seats in a single cockpit, spartan even by the standards of the time. The standard engine was the readily-available 90hp (67kW) RAF 1a. Because of its use in the B.E.2 the engine was familiar to RFC mechanics. No cowling was used, and <b>upswept</b> straight exhaust pipes were fitted. When stocks of the RAF 1a ran short, other engines were fitted, including the 80hp (60kW) Renault.|$|E
500|$|The {{bodywork}} of the BT19 is glass-reinforced plastic, {{finished in}} Brabham's usual racing colours of green with gold trimming around the nose. Although {{the science of}} aerodynamics would not greatly affect Formula One racing until the 1968 season, Tauranac had been making use of the Motor Industry Research Association wind tunnel since 1963 to refine {{the shape of his}} cars. Brabham has attributed the car's [...] "swept-down nose and the <b>upswept</b> rear lip of the engine cowl" [...] to Tauranac's [...] "attention to aerodynamic detail". During the 1967 season, the car appeared with small winglets on the nose, to further reduce lift acting {{at the front of the}} car.|$|E
500|$|The XCG-20, redesignated XG-20 in 1948 {{with the}} {{establishment}} of the USAF, was the largest glider ever constructed in the United States, and the last combat glider to be built for the U.S. military. It featured a high-mounted wing and retractable tricycle landing gear, with an auxiliary power unit supplied hydraulic power to the landing gear and flaps. The nose section was reinforced to provide optimal protection to the pilots {{in the event of a}} crash on landing, and to allow for the strongest possible towing connection. The cargo hold was [...] long and [...] wide; it featured an innovative configuration, the rear fuselage being <b>upswept</b> with an integrated loading ramp. This allowed vehicles to be driven directly on and off of the aircraft, speeding loading and unloading times.|$|E
500|$|At age 12, Divine and {{his parents}} moved to Lutherville, a Baltimore suburb, where he {{attended}} Towson High School, graduating in 1963. Bullied because of his weight and perceived effeminacy, he later reminisced that he [...] "wasn't rough and tough" [...] but instead [...] "loved painting and I always loved flowers and things." [...] Due to this horticultural interest, at 15 he took a part-time job at a local florist's shop. Several years later, he went on a diet that enabled him to drop in weight from , giving him {{a new sense of}} confidence. When he was 17, his parents sent him to a psychiatrist, where he first realized his sexual attraction to men as well as women, something then taboo in conventional American society. He helped out at his parents' day care business, for instance dressing up as Santa Claus to entertain the children at Christmas time. In 1963, he began attending the Marinella Beauty School, where he learned hair styling and, after completing his studies, gained employment at a couple of local salons, specializing in the creation of beehives and other <b>upswept</b> hairstyles. Milstead eventually gave up his job and for a while was financially supported by his parents, who catered to his expensive taste in clothes and cars. They reluctantly paid the many bills that he ran up financing lavish parties where he would dress up in drag as his favourite celebrity, actress Elizabeth Taylor.|$|E

2500|$|The Model 31 {{was a new}} {{flying boat}} design started in 1938, {{intended}} for both military and commercial use. [...] The aircraft was of all-metal construction with a high-mounted, high aspect ratio cantilever monoplane wing (the Davis wing, which was later used in the B-24 Liberator) and an <b>upswept</b> aft fuselage with a tail unit with twin endplate fins and rudders. It had retractable floats on the undersides of the wings and was powered {{by two of the}} new Wright R-3350 radial engines. The civil version could carry seats for 52 passengers, or sleeper accommodation for 28.|$|E
2500|$|The Federation style station {{building}} is a single storeyed rectangular structure with a hipped gable roof. The building, centrally located on the island platform, has two cantilevered <b>upswept</b> awnings with bullnose leading edges, supported on steel lattice trusses, covering the adjacent platform areas. The roof has three metal Boyle's ventilators mounted along the ridge, with hipped gables protruding from the slope {{to either side of}} each ventilator. The building houses a semi-enclosed booking lobby at the northwest end, a station master's office, a waiting shed open to platforms 1 and 2, [...] ladies toilets, a passage between platforms 1 and 2, and at the easternmost end a gift shop and cafe, with an attached kitchen in a lean-to extension.|$|E
2500|$|In 1893 William Doxford and Sons Ltd. ("Doxford") of Sunderland, England built one {{whaleback}} under license {{from the}} type's designer, but had already built its first turret deck ship to a design by Arthur Havers, the concern's chief draughtsman. Havers toned down {{the more radical}} features of the whaleback. His design retained conventional bows and sterns instead of the <b>upswept</b> conoid [...] "snout" [...] of the whaleback. Instead of a rounded hull, the hull of a turret vessel was stepped inward above the waterline, but the horizontal and vertical surfaces of the hull met in curves rather than by right angles as in conventional ships. Finally, the design joined the rounded turrets of whalebacks into one long and narrow rectangular structure (also called a [...] "turret") of about half the beam, and used that space {{as part of the}} hold.|$|E
2500|$|In 1913 Frank McClean and J.H. Spottiswoode {{determined}} to undertake an aerial expedition up the Nile. Realising {{that this would}} require an aircraft with a low wing loading McClean got Shorts to build him an aircraft which was largely a rebuild of S.32 but possibly incorporated components from S.33 and S.34. [...] The resultant machine had an extra bay added to the wings and the overhanging extensions were enlarged, bringing the wingspan up to [...] The aircraft was also given an elongated nacelle with the front elevator mounted on an <b>upswept</b> outrigger on its nose and paired rudders were fitted. The aircraft retained the original [...] Gnome Lambda. However its performance was disappointing and McClean had a new design, the Short S.80, built. The airframe was subsequently further modified, principally by removing the extended wings, to convert it into a Type 38.|$|E
2500|$|In 1970, {{the sedan}} and coupe {{received}} a restyled rear-end, {{along with a}} new C-pillar shape and rear quarters, {{as well as a}} more massive rear end and bumper. The hardtop was changed to a more sloping roofline with <b>upswept</b> reverse-angle quarter windows, giving them [...] "a somewhat huskier look for 1970". The taillights were integrated into a new loop rear bumper with Rebel spelled out between them. The four-door sedans also had an altered roofline with a slimmer C-pillar and larger, squared-off rear door windows. Similarly as on the coupe, the belt line kicked up beneath the trailing edge of the rear door windows, and then tapered back to the same rear fascia as on the hardtop. The Rebel sedans and hardtop models two inches (51mm) longer than previously. The Rebel station wagons saw no change to their rooflines, doors, and rear fascias.|$|E
2500|$|The SF {{evolved to}} include disc brakes and cast alloy wheels. Developed from the 750S road bike was the 750 SFC (super freni competizione), a half-faired racer that was {{developed}} to win endurance events like the Oss 24 hours, Barcelona 24 hours and the Bol D'Or at Le Mans. [...] This it did, often placed first, second and third in the same race, and dominating the international endurance race circuit in 1971. [...] Distinguished by its characteristic orange paint which would become the company's race department colour, its smooth aerodynamic fairing and <b>upswept</b> exhaust, the SFC was Laverda's flagship product and best advertisement, flaunting pedigree and the message of durability, quality, and exclusivity. [...] The SFC [...] "Series 15,000" [...] was featured in the Guggenheim Museum in New York's 1999 exhibit The Art of the Motorcycle {{as one of the}} most iconic bikes of the 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|Whatever {{the origins}} of Gillespie's <b>upswept</b> trumpet, by June 1954 he was using a professionally {{manufactured}} horn of this design, and it {{was to become a}} visual trademark for him {{for the rest of his}} life. Such trumpets were made for him by Martin (from 1954), King Musical Instruments (from 1972) and Renold Schilke (from 1982, a gift from Jon Faddis). Gillespie favored mouthpieces made by Al Cass. In December 1986 Gillespie gave the National Museum of American History his 1972 King [...] "Silver Flair" [...] trumpet with a Cass mouthpiece. In April 1995, Gillespie's Martin trumpet was auctioned at Christie's in New York City, along with instruments used by other famous musicians such as Coleman Hawkins, Jimi Hendrix and Elvis Presley. An image of Gillespie's trumpet was selected for the cover of the auction program. The battered instrument was sold to Manhattan builder Jeffery Brown for $63,000, the proceeds benefiting jazz musicians suffering from cancer.|$|E
2500|$|Manet {{embarked}} {{on the canvas}} after being challenged to give the Salon a nude painting to display. His uniquely frank depiction of a self-assured prostitute was accepted by the Paris Salon in 1865, where it created a scandal. According to Antonin Proust, [...] "only the precautions taken by the administration prevented the painting being punctured and torn" [...] by offended viewers. The painting was controversial partly because the nude is wearing some small items of clothing such as an orchid in her hair, a bracelet, a ribbon around her neck, and mule slippers, all of which accentuated her nakedness, sexuality, and comfortable courtesan lifestyle. The orchid, <b>upswept</b> hair, black cat, and bouquet of flowers were all recognized symbols of sexuality at the time. This modern Venus' body is thin, counter to prevailing standards; the painting's lack of idealism rankled viewers. The painting's flatness, inspired by Japanese wood block art, serves to make the nude more human and less voluptuous. A fully dressed black servant is featured, exploiting the then-current theory that black people were hyper-sexed. That she is wearing the clothing of a servant to a courtesan here furthers the sexual tension of the piece.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fashion of}} the Gibson Girl allowed them {{a much more}} active {{lifestyle}} then previously, in both work and recreation. [...] "Skirts were long and flared, and dresses were tailored with high necks and close-fitting sleeves. The style was considered masculine, and this was sometimes emphasized by wearing a necktie. Though women still wore the restrictive undergarments known as corsets, a new health corset came into style that {{was said to be}} better for the spine than earlier corsets. An S-shaped figure became trendy, with a large bust and large hips, separated by a tiny, corseted waist. These styles, worn with confidence and poise by modern women. ... She might be pictured at a desk in a tailored shirtwaist or at a tennis party in an informal sports dress. She wore her long hair <b>upswept</b> in an elaborate mass of curls, perhaps topped by a simple straw hat. Though she was capable and independent, the Gibson girl was always beautiful and elegant." [...] According to the Library of Congress, [...] "Gibson’s meticulous depiction of their hats accentuates the Gibson Girls' stylish attire and visually reinforces the impression of height, leading the eye to the mountains. ... Gibson shows off the classic Gibson Girl as a figure who embraced outdoor physical activities." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 1951, OKB-153 {{initiated}} {{the design of}} a twin-engined assault transport aircraft, designated DT-5/8 (Desahntno-Trahnsportnyy [...] – assault transport aircraft), to be powered by two Kuznetsov TV-2 turboprop engines, and fitted with a large rear cargo door to allow vehicles to be driven straight into the hold. On 11 December 1953, the Soviet Council of Ministers issued directive No.2922-1251 to the Antonov OKB, requiring them to build a twin-turboprop transport aircraft derived from the DT-5/8. Bearing the in-house designation Izdeliye P the resulting aircraft followed state-of-the-art practice with a high wing carrying two propeller engines, atop a rectangular-section fuselage, tricycle undercarriage with main gear units housed in pods {{on either side of the}} fuselage, and an <b>upswept</b> rear fuselage providing clearance of the tail unit for loading and unloading. After State acceptance trials, production was not recommended due to poor spin characteristics, directional stability and control issues, nosewheel shimmy, poor controllability when landing in crosswinds above 6m/s (12 kt) and also phugoid oscillations in all three axes which were difficult to control and made piloting the prototype tiring. As well as the aerodynamic faults, the TV-2 engines proved difficult to start with unstable gas dynamics at altitudes above 6,000 m (19,700ft).|$|E
2500|$|It was {{the second}} Saunders {{aircraft}} to use their patented [...] "corrugated" [...] structure for the hull, first trialled on the Saunders A.14, in which longitudinal external corrugations in the skin replaced internal riveted stringers. Full trials of the A.14, revealing both {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of this technique were not made until after the Severn had flown. [...] Like the A.14 the Severn's construction largely avoided doubly curved hull plating, so the planing bottom was strictly V-shaped and the upper hull rather slab sided. [...] The hull was a two-step design with tumble-home sides above the chines. [...] There was a gunner's position in the nose and a side-by-side open cockpit for the pilots ahead of the engines and wing. [...] Behind the cockpit and within a windowed part of the hull were crew positions and accommodation, from which a dorsal gunner's position just aft of the wings could be accessed. [...] There was an isolated rear gunner's position at the extreme rear of the <b>upswept</b> rear fuselage, above the braced tailplane and between the two braced fins. [...] Twin balanced elevators projected beyond the tailplane and the fins carried balanced rudders. [...] Early flight trials showed the Severn to be heavy on rudder control, so separate servo-rudders were soon fixed on struts behind the main rudder surfaces. [...] It was also heavy on elevators, which were increased in area.|$|E
60|$|Quitting the Abbey and the Palace, {{we turned}} into the Canongate, and passed thence into High Street, which, I think, is a {{continuation}} of the Canongate; and being now in the old town of Edinburgh, we saw those immensely tall houses, seven stories high, where the people live in tiers, all the way from earth to middle air. They were not so quaint and strange looking as I expected; but there were some houses of very antique individuality, and among them that of John Knox, which looks still in good repair. One thing did not in the least fall short of my expectations,--the evil odor, for which Edinburgh has an immemorial renown,--nor the dirt of the inhabitants, old and young. The town, to say the truth, when you {{are in the midst of}} it, has a very sordid, grimy, shabby, <b>upswept,</b> unwashen aspect, grievously at variance with all poetic and romantic associations.|$|E
60|$|Three or four {{strokes of}} the paddle drove the canoe {{out into the}} stream, and after that, {{all he had to}} do was to hold her straight. This was, however, not {{particularly}} easy, for the mad rush of water deflected by the boulders swung her here and there, and the channel was studded with foam-lapped masses of stone. Gazing forward, intent and strung-up, he checked her now and then with a feathering backstroke of the paddle, while the boulders flashed up toward her out of the spray, and the pines ashore reeled by. The foam stood high about the hollowed, <b>upswept</b> bow, and at times boiled a handbreadth above the depressed waist, but, while the canoe swept on like a toboggan, none came in. There was more than a spice of risk in it, and Ida, who knew what the result would be if her companion's nerve momentarily deserted him, now and then glanced over her shoulder. When she did so, he smiled reassuringly, leaning forward with wet hands clenched hard on the flashing paddle. She felt that he was to be relied on.|$|E
