25|$|Initial {{reception}} for MUSHA was mixed. Critics found themselves {{overwhelmed by the}} sheer amount of shoot 'em <b>ups</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Sega Genesis and felt the title was unremarkable. Journalists generally agreed the game had great graphics and enjoyable gameplay, but felt it was unoriginal and not very challenging. In retrospect, MUSHA has garnered much higher praise, being cited for its challenging gameplay, strong soundtrack, and graphics considered ahead of its time. It remains among the most highly regarded shoot 'em <b>ups</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Genesis and is considered among {{the best of the}} 16-bit era. Original MUSHA cartridges have become rare and command high prices in the collector market, however, the game was re-released <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Wii Virtual Console in Japan in 2008, and the west in 2009.|$|R
