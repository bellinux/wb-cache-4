25|$|HPLC most {{commonly}} uses a <b>UV-Vis</b> absorbance detector, however, {{a wide range}} of other chromatography detectors can be used. A universal detector that complements <b>UV-Vis</b> absorbance detection is the Charged aerosol detector (CAD). A kind of commonly utilized detector includes refractive index detectors, which provide readings by measuring the changes in the refractive index of the effluent as it moves through the flow cell. In certain cases, it is possible to use multiple detectors, for example LCMS normally combines <b>UV-Vis</b> with a mass spectrometer.|$|E
25|$|<b>UV-Vis</b> {{microspectroscopy}} is {{also used}} to analyze trace evidence, such as textile fibers and paint chips, as well as questioned documents.|$|E

25|$|The spectroscopic {{properties}} of FAD and its variants allows for reaction monitoring {{by use of}} <b>UV-VIS</b> absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies. Each of the different forms of FAD have distinct absorbance spectra, making for easy observation of changes in oxidation state. A major local absorbance maximum for FAD is observed at 450nm, with an extinction coefficient of 11,300. Flavins in general have fluorescent activity when unbound (proteins bound to flavin nucleic acid derivatives are called flavoproteins). This property can be utilized when examining protein binding, observing loss of fluorescent activity when put into the bound state. Oxidized flavins have high absorbances of about 450nm, and fluoresce at about 515-520nm.|$|E
500|$|The last DU {{spectrophotometer}} {{was produced}} on July 6, 1976. By the 1980s, computers were being incorporated into scientific instruments such as Bausch & Lomb's Spectronic 2000 <b>UV-Vis</b> spectrophotometer, to improve data acquisition and provide instrument control. [...] Specialized spectrophotometers designed for specific tasks now {{tend to be}} used rather than general [...] "all-purpose machines" [...] like the DU.|$|E
500|$|The DU spectrophotometers used a quartz prism to {{separate}} {{light from a}} lamp into its absorption spectrum and a phototube to electrically measure the light energy across the spectrum. This allowed the user to plot the light absorption spectrum of a substance to obtain a standardized [...] "fingerprint" [...] characteristic of a compound. [...] All modern <b>UV-Vis</b> spectrophotometer are built on the same basic principles as the DU spectrophotometer.|$|E
500|$|When RCA {{could not}} meet Beckman's demand for {{experimental}} phototubes, National Technical Laboratories again had to design its own components in-house. They developed {{a pair of}} phototubes, sensitive to the red and blue areas of the spectrum, capable of amplifying the signals they received. [...] With the incorporation of Beckman's UV-sensitive phototubes, the Model D became the Model DU <b>UV-Vis</b> spectrophotometer. Its designation as a [...] "UV-Vis" [...] spectrophotometer indicates its ability to measure light in both the visible and ultraviolet spectra.|$|E
500|$|Sometimes {{referred}} to as a <b>UV-Vis</b> spectrophotometer because it measured both the ultraviolet (UV) and visible spectra, the DU spectrophotometer is credited as being a truly revolutionary technology. [...] It yielded more accurate results than previous methods for determining the chemical composition of a complex substance, and substantially reduced the time needed for an accurate analysis [...] from weeks or hours to minutes. [...] The Beckman DU was essential to several critical secret research projects during World War II, including the development of penicillin and synthetic rubber.|$|E
500|$|The DU {{spectrophotometer}} {{was also}} used for critical analysis of hydrocarbons. A number of hydrocarbons were {{of interest to the}} war effort. [...] Toluene, a hydrocarbon in crude oil, was used in production of TNT for military use. Benzene and [...] butadienes were used in the production of synthetic rubber. Rubber, used in tires for jeeps, airplanes and tanks, was in critically short supply because the United States was cut off from foreign supplies of natural rubber. The Office of Rubber Reserve organized researchers at universities and in industry to secretly work on the problem. [...] The demand for synthetic rubber caused Beckman Instruments to develop infrared spectrophotometers. Infrared spectrophotometers were better suited than <b>UV-Vis</b> spectrophotometers to the analysis of C4 hydrocarbons, particularly for applications in petroleum refining and gasoline production.|$|E
2500|$|Narrow-bore columns (1–2mm) {{are used}} for {{applications}} when more sensitivity is desired either with special <b>UV-vis</b> detectors, fluorescence detection or with other detection methods like liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ...|$|E
2500|$|A <b>UV-Vis</b> {{spectrophotometer}} will do {{all this}} automatically. To use this machine, solutions are placed in a small cuvette and inserted into the holder. The machine is controlled through a computer and, once you [...] "blank" [...] it, will automatically display the absorbance plotted against wavelength. Getting the absorbance spectrum of a solution is useful for determining the concentration of that solution using the Beer–Lambert law and is used in HPLC.|$|E
2500|$|Changes in the (M-L) bond {{distances}} {{are going}} to affect the symmetry and electronic states of metal complexes. [...] <b>UV-vis</b> spectroscopy is a very useful tool for the determination of the changes of electronic states due to the SCO. [...] For example, the HS and LS states of an FeII compound such as FeII(pic)3Cl2·EtOH, can be followed with <b>UV-vis</b> spectroscopy. [...] The absorption spectra of these FeII molecules at different temperatures clearly show the change in intensities of the spin allowed transitions, due to these symmetric changes. Similarly to FT-IR, the intensities of the absorption bands are proportional to the fraction of metal centers in the corresponding spin state; the more intense the band, the higher the fraction of metal centers in that spin state. [...] In Figure 9, the 5T2→5E absorption band, (left spectrum), corresponds to the HS transition and is centered at 830nm. [...] The optical density of the HS band is proportional to the γHS, and a γHS vs. temperature can be plotted as in Figure 10. The LS state is seen at a higher energy which is centered at 470nm (shown on the right in Figure 9). [...] However, the LS state absorption bands are indistinguishable due to the high intensity absorption bands caused by the Metal-to-Ligand Charge Transfer (MLCT) absorption bands.|$|E
2500|$|A {{solution}} of aquacyano-corrinoids, such as cobalamin or cobinamide, reacts with free cyanide {{in an aqueous}} sample. The binding of cyanide to the corrinoid cobalt center leads to a color change from orange to violet, allowing for semi-quantification by naked-eye. Precise quantification of the cyanide content is feasible by <b>UV-vis</b> spectroscopy. Absorption of the corrinoid on a solid phase, allows detection of cyanide even in colored samples, rendering this method appropriate {{for the analysis of}} cyanide in water, wastewater, blood, and food. [...] Furthermore, this technology is non-toxic and considerably less prone to interference than the pyridine-barbituric acid colorimetry method.|$|E
2500|$|An {{alternate}} {{method for}} acquiring spectra is the [...] "dispersive" [...] or [...] "scanning monochromator" [...] method. [...] In this approach, {{the sample is}} irradiated sequentially with various single wavelengths. The dispersive method {{is more common in}} <b>UV-Vis</b> spectroscopy, but is less practical in the infrared than the FTIR method. One reason that FTIR is favored is called [...] "Fellgett's advantage" [...] or the [...] "multiplex advantage": The information at all frequencies is collected simultaneously, improving both speed and signal-to-noise ratio. Another is called [...] "Jacquinot's Throughput Advantage": A dispersive measurement requires detecting much lower light levels than an FTIR measurement. There are other advantages, as well as some disadvantages, but virtually all modern infrared spectrometers are FTIR instruments.|$|E
2500|$|EE {{is ideal}} for {{pharmaceuticals}} with low concentrations of active ingredient, such as those containing proteins and peptides, because {{of its ability to}} lower limits of detection for liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis. [...] In addition, sample enrichment by EE helps overcome the low injection volumes and short optical path length of <b>UV-Vis</b> detectors that accompany CE. [...] EE coupled to CE has been used to separate and analyze antisense oligonucleotides. [...] Antisense oligonucleotides inhibit protein expression from their complimentary base pair sequence and can treat certain diseases and genetic disorders. [...] EE coupled to liquid chromatography also successfully detects low concentration metabolites in urine for the purpose of studying metabolic processes. [...] In addition, EE-ITP-CE has been used in the determination of the drugs clenbuterol, salbutamol, terbutaline, and fenoterol.|$|E
2500|$|Transition metal {{complexes}} {{often have}} spectacular colors caused by electronic transitions by {{the absorption of}} light. For this reason they are often applied as pigments. Most transitions {{that are related to}} colored metal complexes are either d–d transitions or charge transfer bands. [...] In a d–d transition, an electron in a dorbital on the metal is excited by a photon to another d orbital of higher energy. [...] A charge transfer band entails promotion of an electron from a metal-based orbital into an empty ligand-based orbital (Metal-to-Ligand Charge Transfer or MLCT). [...] The converse also occurs: excitation of an electron in a ligand-based orbital into an empty metal-based orbital (Ligand to Metal Charge Transfer or LMCT). [...] These phenomena can be observed with the aid of electronic spectroscopy; also known as <b>UV-Vis.</b> For simple compounds with high symmetry, the d–d transitions can be assigned using Tanabe–Sugano diagrams. [...] These assignments are gaining increased support with computational chemistry.|$|E
2500|$|Major {{characteristics}} of nanoparticles include volume, structure, and visual properties {{that make them}} valuable in nanobiotechnology. Depending on specific properties of size, structure, and luminescence, nanoparticles {{can be used for}} different applications. Imaging techniques are used to identify such properties and give more information about the tested sample. Techniques used to characterize nanoparticles are also useful in studying how nanoparticles interact with biomolecules, such as amino acids or DNA, and include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), denoted by the solubility of the nanoparticles in water and fluorescent. MRI can be applied in the medical field to visualize structures; atomic force microscopy (AFM) that gives a topographic view [...] of the sample on a substrate; transmission electron microscopy (TEM) that gives a top view, but with a different technique then that of atomic force microscopy; Raman spectroscopy or surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) gives information about wavelengths and energy in the sample. ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (<b>UV-Vis)</b> measures the wavelengths where light is absorbed; X-ray diffraction (XRD) generally gives an idea of the chemical composition of the sample.|$|E

50|$|Scanning {{electron}} microscopy (SEM), transmission {{electron microscopy}} (TEM), energy dispersive analysis of X-ray (EDX), <b>UV-vis</b> spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction are used to characterize different aspects of nanoparticles.

Energy dispersive analysis of X-ray is used to determine elemental composition, and X-ray diffraction is used to determine chemical composition and crystallographic structure. <b>UV-Vis</b> absorption peaks for silver, gold, and cadmium sulfide nanoparticles can vary depending on particle size: 25-50 nm silver particles peak ca. 415 nm, gold nanoparticles 30-40 nm peak ca. 450 nm, while a cadmium sulfide absorption edge ca. 450 is indicative of quantum size particles. Larger nanoparticle of each type will have <b>UV-Vis</b> absorption peaks or edges that shift to longer wavelengths while smaller nanoparticles will have <b>UV-Vis</b> absorption peaks or edges that shift to shorter wavelengths.|$|E
