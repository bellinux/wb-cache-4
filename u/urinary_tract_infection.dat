5|$|About 150 {{million people}} {{developed}} a <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> each year. They {{are more common}} in women than men. In women, {{they are the most}} common form of bacterial infection. Up to 10% of women have a <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> in a given year and half of women having at least one infection at some point in their lives. They occur most frequently between the ages of 16 and 35years. Recurrences are common. Urinary tract infections have been described since ancient times with the first documented description in the Ebers Papyrus dated to c. 1550 BC.|$|E
5|$|Persons with {{spinal cord}} injury are at {{increased}} risk for <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> in part because of chronic use of catheter, and in part because of voiding dysfunction. It is {{the most common cause of}} infection in this population, as well as the most common cause of hospitalization. Additionally, use of cranberry juice or cranberry supplement appears to be ineffective in prevention and treatment in this population.|$|E
5|$|Pregnancy is {{associated}} with greater-than-normal risks in women with SCI, among them increased risk of deep vein thrombosis, respiratory infection, and <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection.</b> Considerations exist such as maintaining proper positioning in a wheelchair, prevention of pressure sores, and increased difficulty moving due to weight gain and changes in center of balance. Assistive devices {{may need to be}} altered and medications changed.|$|E
40|$|Lower <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> {{are very}} common diseases. Recurrent <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> remain {{challenging}} to treat because the main treatment option is long-term antibiotic prophylaxis; however, this poses a {{risk for the}} emergence of bacterial resistance. Some options to avoid this risk are available, including the use of cranberry products. This article reviews the key methods in using cranberries as a preventive measure for lower <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections,</b> including in vitro studies and clinical trials...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{research}} different methods for decreasing catheter-associated <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> in hospitalized patients. Background: Catheter-associated <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> (CAUTIs) are very common in the hospital setting. These infections are very costly {{to the hospital and}} compromise patient safety by increasing rates of morbidity and mortality. In order for CAUTI rates to decrease, nurses and physicians must become more aware of the presence of catheters in patients. Method: A search was conducted using CINAHL, Medline, and Google Scholar for current research studies regarding the reduction of catheter-associated <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections.</b> Results: The implementation of reminder systems, both physical and virtual, significantly reduced the number of catheter-associated <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> in hospitalized patients. Conclusions: Rates of catheter-associated <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> can be decreased by executing paper and computer-based reminder systems to help alert nurses and physicians of the presence of catheters in their patients...|$|R
50|$|Important {{clinical}} infections {{caused by}} Enterococcus include <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections,</b> bacteremia, bacterial endocarditis, diverticulitis, and meningitis. Sensitive strains of these bacteria {{can be treated}} with ampicillin, penicillin and vancomycin. <b>Urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> can be treated specifically with nitrofurantoin, even in cases of vancomycin resistance.|$|R
5|$|DKA most {{frequently}} occurs {{in those who}} already have diabetes, {{but it may also}} be the first presentation in someone who had not previously been known to be diabetic. There is often a particular underlying problem that has led to the DKA episode; this may be intercurrent illness (pneumonia, influenza, gastroenteritis, a <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection),</b> pregnancy, inadequate insulin administration (e.g. defective insulin pen device), myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke or the use of cocaine. Young people with recurrent episodes of DKA may have an underlying eating disorder, or may be using insufficient insulin for fear that it will cause weight gain.|$|E
5|$|In November 1990, Michael Schiavo took Terri to the University of California, San Francisco for {{experimental}} nerve stimulation with a thalamic stimulator. The treatment took several months and was unsuccessful. He returned to Florida {{with her in}} January 1991 and admitted her as an inpatient to the Mediplex Rehabilitation Center in Bradenton, Florida. On July 19, 1991, Terri Schiavo {{was transferred to the}} Sabal Palms Skilled Care Facility, where she received neurological testing and regular speech and occupational therapy until 1994. In mid-1993, Michael Schiavo requested a do not resuscitate order for her after she contracted a <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{women with}} {{cervicitis}} (inflammation of the cervix) or vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina) and in {{young men with}} UTI symptoms, a Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrheae infection may be the cause. These infections are typically classified as a urethritis rather than a <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection.</b> Vaginitis may also {{be due to a}} yeast infection. Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) may be considered for people who experience multiple episodes of UTI symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and not improved with antibiotics. Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the role of idiopathic hypercalciuria (IH) in causing hematuria, nephrolithiasis and recurrent <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> we studied two groups of children for idiopathic hypercalciuria. 1) Patients group: children with hematuria, nephrolithiasis and recurrent <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> (n= 452). 2) Control group: children with no <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> problem (n= 100). In control group 3 % of children had IH. In patients group 27. 5 % of patients with hematuria, 37 % of patients with nephrolithiasis and 7. 9 % of patients with recurrent <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> had IH, P values= 0. 001, 0. 005 and 0. 2, respectively.

40|$|<b>Urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> (UTI) are {{a common}} and {{important}} clinical problem in childhood. Upper <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> (ie, acute pyelonephritis) may lead to renal scarring, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease. Although children with pyelonephritis tend to present with fever, {{it is often difficult}} on clinical grounds to distinguish cystitis from pyelonephritis, particularly in young children (those younger than two years) [1]. As a result, we have defined UTI broadly here without attempting to distinguish cystitis from pyelonephritis. Acute cystitis in older children is discussed separately. (See "Acute cystitis in children older than two years and adolescents".) The clinical features and diagnosis of UTI in children will be discussed here. The epidemiology, risk factors, and management of UTI in children and UTI in newborns (younger than one month of age) are discussed separately. (See "Epidemiology and risk factors for <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> in children" and "Acute management, imaging, and prognosis of <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> in infants and children older than one month" and "Long-term management and prevention of <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> in children" and "Urinary <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> in newborns". ...|$|R

5|$|Koalas can {{be subject}} to {{pathogens}} such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria, which can cause keratoconjunctivitis, <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection,</b> and reproductive tract infection. Such infections are widespread on the mainland, but absent in some island populations. The koala retrovirus (KoRV) may cause koala immune deficiency syndrome (KIDS) {{which is similar to}} AIDS in humans. Prevalence of KoRV in koala populations suggests a trend spreading from the north to the south of Australia. Northern populations are completely infected, while some southern populations (including Kangaroo Island) are free.|$|E
5|$|A <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>{{infection}}</b> (UTI) is {{an infection}} that affects {{part of the}} urinary tract. When it affects the lower urinary tract it {{is known as a}} bladder infection (cystitis) and when it affects the upper urinary tract it is known as kidney infection (pyelonephritis). Symptoms from a lower urinary tract include pain with urination, frequent urination, and feeling the need to urinate despite having an empty bladder. Symptoms of a kidney infection include fever and flank pain usually in addition to the symptoms of a lower UTI. Rarely the urine may appear bloody. In the very old and the very young, symptoms may be vague or non-specific.|$|E
5|$|Uropathogenic E. coli {{from the}} gut {{is the cause}} of 80–85% of community-acquired urinary tract infections, with Staphylococcus saprophyticus being the cause in 5–10%. Rarely they may be due to viral or fungal infections. Healthcare-associated urinary tract infections (mostly related to urinary catheterization) involve a much broader range of {{pathogens}} including: E. coli (27%), Klebsiella (11%), Pseudomonas (11%), the fungal pathogen Candida albicans (9%), and Enterococcus (7%) among others. Urinary tract infections due to Staphylococcus aureus typically occur secondary to blood-borne infections. Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium can infect the urethra but not the bladder. These infections are usually classified as a urethritis rather than <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to note that mice as a species do not grapple with <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> like humans do, unless some part of their TLR 11 immune response is made non-functional.

40|$|Background/Aim. <b>Urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> {{are still}} the most {{frequent}} complications in patients {{with spinal cord injury}} (SCI). The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the factors influencing development of <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> during rehabilitation in patients with SCI. Methods. This retrospective case/control study including 540 patients with SCI which were rehabilitated in the Clinic for Rehabilitation “Dr Miroslav Zotović” between January 2000 and December 2009. We used patient files and other avail-able medical documentation for obtaining information contained in this study, such as the manner of bladder emptying, the type of neurological disorder of the bladder, the neurological level and completeness of a lesion, the injury etiology, treatment method, secondary complications and associated injuries, kidney and bladder calculosis, age and sex. Results. Out of the total number of patients included in the study, 152 (28. 1 %) were without <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections,</b> whereas 388 (71. 9 %) had <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections.</b> There were 389 (72 %) male and 151 (28 %) female patients. The average age of patients without <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> was 51. 0 ± 15. 4 years, whereas the mean age of patients with <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> was 44. 3 ± 16. 9 years. The results of our study showed that the occurrence of <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> during rehabilitation in patients with SCIs was associated with the following factors: combined injuries (OR = 3. 5), anemia (OR = 5. 67), type of the bladder functional disorder (OR = 40 - 60) and crystals in urine (OR = 7. 54). Conclusion. The physicians should take precautions and try to make the early diagnosis and rapid appropriate treatment of <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> in patients with SCI who also have functional bladder disorder, combined spinal injuries, anemia or urine crystals...|$|R

5|$|Each {{species of}} {{pathogen}} has a characteristic spectrum of interactions with its human hosts. Some organisms, such as Staphylococcus or Streptococcus, can cause skin infections, pneumonia, meningitis and even overwhelming sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response producing shock, massive vasodilation and death. Yet these organisms are {{also part of}} the normal human flora and usually exist on the skin or in the nose without causing any disease at all. Other organisms invariably cause disease in humans, such as the Rickettsia, which are obligate intracellular parasites able to grow and reproduce only within the cells of other organisms. One species of Rickettsia causes typhus, while another causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Chlamydia, another phylum of obligate intracellular parasites, contains species that can cause pneumonia, or <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> and may be involved in coronary heart disease. Finally, some species, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia, and Mycobacterium avium, are opportunistic pathogens and cause disease mainly in people suffering from immunosuppression or cystic fibrosis.|$|E
