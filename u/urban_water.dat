5|$|Volcanic ash {{can have}} a {{detrimental}} {{impact on the environment}} which can be difficult to predict due to the large variety of environmental conditions that exist within the ash fall zone. Natural waterways can be impacted {{in the same way as}} <b>urban</b> <b>water</b> supply networks. Ash will increase water turbidity which can reduce the amount of light reaching lower depths, which can inhibit growth of submerged aquatic plants and consequently affect species which are dependent on them such as fish and shellfish. High turbidity can also affect the ability of fish gills to absorb dissolved oxygen. Acidification will also occur, which will reduce the pH of the water and impact the fauna and flora living in the environment. Fluoride contamination will occur if the ash contains high concentrations of fluoride.|$|E

40|$|From {{the point}} of view of urban {{consumption}} behavior, <b>urban</b> fresh <b>water</b> consumption could be classified as three types, namely, direct, indirect and induced water consumption. A calculation approach of <b>urban</b> fresh <b>water</b> consumption was presented based on the theory of urban basic material consumption and the input-output method, which was utilized to calculate <b>urban</b> fresh <b>water</b> consumption of China, and to analyze its structural change and causes. The results show that the total <b>urban</b> fresh <b>water</b> consumption increased 561. 7 x 10 (9) m(3), and the proportion to the total national fresh water resources increased by 20 percentage points from 1952 to 2005. The proportion of direct and induced water consumption had been continuously rising, and it increased by 15 and 35 percentage points separately from 1952 to 2005, while the proportion of indirect water consumption decreased by 50 percentage points. <b>Urban</b> indirect <b>water</b> consumption was mainly related to urban grain, beef and mutton consumption, and <b>urban</b> induced <b>water</b> consumption had a close relationship with the amount of carbon emission per capita.

40|$|<b>Urban</b> surface <b>waters</b> {{frequently}} receive treated or untreated wastewater. In these wastewater-dominant systems, endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) {{are commonly}} present. These EDCs {{have the potential}} to produce toxic effects in organisms at very low concentrations (ug/L to ng/L). To assess the effects of <b>urban</b> <b>waters</b> with wastewater influence, a 48 -hour fish exposure was performed exposing fathead minnows to surface water from three locations. Gene expression microarrays were used to determine the influence of exposures on gene expression in fish. Water from the sites was analyzed for the presence of organic contaminants using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Fish serum cholesterol was measured using a fluorometric kit. These <b>urban</b> <b>waters</b> altered transcription of fish cholesterol metabolism and DNA repair genes. Moreover, exposed fish had elevated cholesterol levels. These findings resemble the effects caused by perflurochemicals (PFCs) commonly found EDCs in urban waterways. Investigated <b>urban</b> <b>waters</b> contain PFCs in the 200 - 250 ng/L range. Further research demonstrates the occurrence of PFCs during a water year in an urban stream that enters a protected area. The dominant PFCs found in this stream were PFOS (Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid), PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic acid), and PFHxA (Perfluorohexanoic acid). To confirm the findings of the field study, we exposed fathead minnows during 48 h through water spiked with three different PFOS concentrations (0; 500 and, 25000 ng/L) and a mixture of PFCs; in an attempt to mimic typical concentrations of PFCs found in <b>urban</b> <b>waters.</b> Additionally, to explore non-destructive sampling methods, blood was used as starting material for microarray analysis. When compared with liver, the number of altered genes in blood was five times greater. The concentrations of PFCs used in this study altered gene expression in fish being the most prominent effects related to DNA repair, lipid, mitochondrial and thyroid hormone metabolism. Altered expression of genes involved in metabolic pathways was common to both liver and blood. Also, PFC exposure led to up-regulation of estrogen receptor in both liver and blood. Surprisingly, the up-regulation of vitellogenin genes was observed in blood tissue. These gene expression profiles fit into adverse outcome pathways suggesting effects on survival and reproduction on fish...|$|R
