40|$|Online {{education}} is increasingly recognized by medical educators {{as a teaching}} and learning tool to support formal and continuing medical education. The faculty development team at Cincinnati <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> <b>Hospital</b> Medical Center (CCHMC) {{in collaboration with the}} University of Cincinnati College of Education (UCCOE) developed an Online Masters Degree in Education program designed to provide healthcare professionals with the educational pedagogy needed to teach more effectively and to conduct educational research. A qualitative case study describes the experiences of four physicians who completed the existing Master’s Degree in Education (Curriculum and Instruction major) in a combined in-class/online format. These physicians then helped customize the curriculum for medical education and adapt the program to an all-online format. Each participant benefited from the program in different ways (e. g. improved educational research methods, teaching and technology skills, assessment techniques, performance-based learning). The program introduced new concepts in education that the physician participants were able to adapt to medical education. All participants became more aware of their role as educators, and demonstrated increased understanding of teaching and learning concepts, including the many benefits of online learning for physicians with full-time professional responsibilities...|$|R
40|$|Paediatric {{health care}} is {{becoming}} highly specialized {{and there is a}} need of nurses with specialist knowledge in the field. A large turnover of personnel and shortage of specially trained paediatric nurses have resulted in employing newly graduated and inexperienced nurses which further contributes to a decrease in professional competence. Development of professional competence is thus a process that has to be present at all times and must be evaluated continuously. The aim of this thesis was to identify how competence levels can be shown by describing and analyzing how nurses employed in paediatric care describe their nursing role and how they evaluate their professional level and attitudes to research utilization. Furthermore, we wanted to analyze qualitative differences between nurses with diverse formal education and experiences. Study I: When eighteen newly graduated and newly employed nurses described what they included in the concepts of responsibility, management of daily and rapidly changing situations and reflection, the results, analysed with qualitative content analysis, showed that nurses seemed to be fully aware of their responsibility regarding patients well-being. The moral responsibilities, i. e. to act as the patient s advocate and protect patient s personal integrity, was also evident. The nurses emphasized the need of time and space for reflection, but also time to acquire the necessary knowledge for providing optimal nursing. Study II: Fifty-six newly graduated and newly employed nurses at two <b>children</b> <b>s</b> <b>hospitals</b> responded in written form to the two questionnaires; Professional Self Description Form (PSDF) 21 items in total including empathy, flexibility, ability to act etc.), and Barriers Scale 29 items in total concerning perceived barriers to research utilization). The results showed that in PSDF the nurses scored highest in compassion, ambition and sensitivity. The lowest scores were found in preparedness to act and problem-solving ability, leadership and discriminating capacity. In the Barriers Scale the nurses perceived the lowest barriers in the affirmations pertaining to themselves as nurses and the highest barriers within the areas concerning the organization. Study III: We have compared newly graduated nurses who had received traditional introductory training and had worked for two years at a <b>children</b> <b>s</b> <b>hospital</b> (Controls, n= 36) with nurses going through a one year trainee programme (Trainees, n= 42) and with paediatric nurses with specialist education (Specialists, n= 35), using the same questionnaire as in study II. The results showed that the control nurses rated themselves higher in the PSDF description of persistence compared to the other two groups. No other differences were found. In the Barriers Scale the specialists scored higher barrier in the affirmations pertaining to themselves as nurses, especially in that the nurse is unwilling to test new ideas, that there are not enough experienced colleagues with whom to discuss research results, and that the administration does not allow implementation of research results. Study IV: When comparing nurses with diverse formal education and experiences concerning qualitative differences when reasoning about a paediatric case the results showed some disparities. The study was based on six recorded group discussions of a fictive but realistic paediatric case and was analysed by a qualitative latent content analysis. Out of the themes found: <b>child</b> <b>s</b> social situation, <b>child</b> abuse and the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> illness, qualitative differences emerged in how the nurses discussed the case. Three separate approaches were identified: a task-oriented, an action-oriented and a hypothesis-oriented, the latter being evident in the two groups comprised of nurses with specialist education. Between the two other groups, novice and experienced nurses, no differences were shown in how they discussed the case. In conclusion: Newly graduated nurses are aware of their responsibility as nurses in general. Self-evaluation of professional self and barriers to research utilization are quite similar and independent of professional experience and knowledge. Nurses with long experience and specialist education have a different approach in how they discuss a fictive but realistic case compared to nurses with lower educational level. Thus, the importance of experience per se for the development of competence is still an open question. Working experience in combination with further, specialist education seems to be of importance in the development of professional competence in paediatric care...|$|R

This case report concerns a 15 month old, healthy boy who {{was admitted to the}} <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> <b>Hospital</b> with croup and failed to recover within the week. The boy had a postive throat culture for herpes simplex type 1 and was diagnosed with croup due to herpes simplex on the basis of sereology. The boy was treated with corticosteroids; a recognised practice in severe cases of croup. The harmful effects of corticosteroids in herpes simplex croup, if indeed any, are not known. We surmise that in this case the use of corticosteroids was not a decisive factor, but it has been previously noted that prolonged corticosteroid treatment can play a role in herpes simplex infection. Furthermore it has been debated whether other viral pathogens proceed the infection, but in this case serology indicates otherwise. Keywords: Croup, herpes simplex infection, corticosteroids.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough <b>University.</b> <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> library services offer children a means of developing their reading skills through the provision of books and other resources. <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> library services might be operated by public libraries, school library services or schools. A small proportion of public library authorities in the UK choose to operate specialist mobile libraries which cater for children alone. Such vehicles deliver a library service to children {{across a range of}} geographic and socioeconomic areas with the stated aims of promoting reading and a love of books, and accessing children who would not otherwise use library services. This study evaluated whether <b>children</b> <b>s</b> mobile libraries (CMLs) across the UK reach those aims and examined the methods by which the aims were targeted. It was decided that the most appropriate research method was to take an inductive perspective and qualitative approach forming a constructivist methodology. The evaluation was achieved by the use of grounded theory as a general method together with ethnographic techniques, in order to observe and understand the interactions of social actors, and identify the processes used to encourage reading. Interviews with key individuals were primarily held to gain access into the field and inform the scope of the research. Participant observations were conducted on 12 of the 26 <b>children</b> <b>s</b> libraries operating in the UK and further interviews with <b>children</b> <b>s</b> mobile library (CML) operators and CML service managers were also carried out. Extensive field notes were taken, then coded and analysed by the grounded theory method in order to understand <b>children</b> <b>s</b> and adults perceptions of the value of a CML to their lives. A model of the influences on <b>children</b> <b>s</b> reading was developed to understand the place of a CML in <b>children</b> <b>s</b> literacy. Existing published research was used initially to set the context of the study, and then as data throughout the project. Published and recognised theories about literacy development, learning, and well-being were consulted at relevant points during the research. Analytical reports of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> library services, practitioner handbooks and professional magazines were searched along with unpublished documents provided by library authorities. Issues that were raised from these sources included: the role of untrained library staff; supplying library services to the socially excluded; working with other agencies and the use of reading intervention schemes. The history, function, purpose and definition of CMLs were outlined. Five theories of event, reach, resource, process and well-being emerged from the data and examples of best practice were identified. The daily operation of a CML was modelled using those five theories to create a transferable standard against which to judge similar <b>children</b> <b>s</b> provision. It was found that <b>children</b> <b>s</b> mobile libraries promote reading because of their transient nature; through the relationships of children with the staff who work on the vehicles; {{by the nature of the}} learning environment and specialist stock of the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> mobile library, and because they access children who would otherwise not use any other library service...|$|R
40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} the experiences of children with high and intermediate imperforate anus and of their parents; how they have experienced care and treatment and what consequences the malformation involve for them. Materials: For Paper I three patients with high imperforate anus and their families were interviewed. The patients were born before 1987 and {{at the time of the}} interview they were 12, 14 and 22 years old. Paper II and III are based on the same study sample. Twenty-five children with high or intermediate imperforate anus born 1987 - 1992 and their parents participated in the index group. Two groups of children similar to each other in age and gender distributions, along with their parents, served as controls. Methods: In Paper I the interviews were conducted at the hospital. The interview guide consisted of open-ended and structured questions, and the sessions covered many different aspects of the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> malformation, as well as treatment and psychosocial consequences of the defect. In Papers II and III the instruments used to gather data were questionnaires developed on the basis of the previous interview study. The <b>children</b> <b>s</b> questionnaire consisted of 45 items divided into psychosocial domains and one physical domain. The parent s questionnaire consisted of 59 items covering various domains such as the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> <b>hospital</b> care, questions about psychosocial issues concerning both the child and the parent and finally the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> physical functioning associated with the malformation. Child Behavior Checklist was filled in by the parents. Teachers Report Form was filled in by the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> teachers. Results: In the analysis of the interviews four categories related to effects of the malformation emerged: physical, emotional, social, and family. The physical and emotional effects of the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> malformation influenced the family <b>s</b> experiences. <b>Children</b> with imperforate anus exhibited an overall positive attitude. They reported that they enjoyed school, had good relationships with schoolmates, had several friends, and participated in leisure activities. Constipation occurred more frequently than in control groups. Answers from parents of children with imperforate anus indicated lower values on variables concerning care, information, and involvement in the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> healthcare treatment, compared with the two control groups. No significant differences on these issues were found between the answers of the mothers and fathers of children with imperforate anus. In the CBCL, the children in the index group were assessed to have significantly more emotional/behavioral problems than the children in control groups. In the TRF, the teachers reported few symptoms for the index group children. Conclusions: Parents of children with imperforate anus had experienced suffering and many difficulties associated with the malformation. Children with imperforate anus in this study did not seem to have any psychosocial impairment, though their parents stated that they experienced leakage, constipation, and fecal odor. The children might have some psychosocial difficulties according to parents but not according to their teachers. Parents of children with imperforate anus experienced less satisfaction with medical care and the support received had been insufficient. An open communication and an interaction between healthcare professionals are important. Psychosocial support for children with imperforate anus and their parents has been limited in our clinic earlier, and a liaison between the pediatric surgery unit and the child and adolescent psychiatry unit would be desirable...|$|R
40|$|Background: Breast {{milk fat}} content {{accounts}} for the largest part of infants 19 energy and {{may be influenced by}} many factors, including maternal factors, which may vary in different settings. So far, there has been no published data no published data on whether the breast milk fat content of Indonesian mothers is affected by their body composition or nutritional intake. Objective: To investigate breast milk fat content of Indonesian mothers and its associations with maternal body composition and nutritional intake. Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted at Budi Kemuliaan Mothers 19 and <b>Children</b> 19 <b>s</b> <b>Hospital.</b> Breast milk specimens were collected from 48 nursing mothers, centrifuged, and tested by creamatocrit for fat content. A 24 -hour food recall was performed to evaluate maternal macronutrient intake. Maternal body composition was evaluated by bioelectric impedance analysis. Univariable correlations between breast milk fat content and either energy and macronutrient intake were assessed using the Spearman rho test. Results: All nursing mothers had breast milk fat content within clinically normal range [mean 59. 4 (SD 15. 9) g/L]. There was no significant correlation between milk fat content and maternal body fat (r=- 0. 03, P= 0. 840), total body water (r= 0. 09 P= 0. 509),or muscle mass (r= 0. 08, P= 0. 577). Milk fat content seemed to weakly correlated with maternal fat intake, although it was not statistically significant (r= 0. 27, P= 0. 065).

40|$|Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) {{constitutes}} {{a group of}} E. coli {{that in the past}} two decades has been the cause of several outbreaks of gastrointestinal disease. The microorganism causes hemorrhagic colitis (HC) and haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in 5 - 10 % of the patients, 30 % of the HUS patients develop remaining kidney injuries. The capacity to control EHEC disease and to limit the scale of outbreaks is dependent upon prompt diagnosis and identification of the source of infection. 	Cattle are the principal reservoir of EHEC and foodstuffs, which presumably have come into contact with domestic animal manure and/or are inadequately pasteurised, are important vehicles of infection. 	The predominating virulence factor of EHEC is the verocytotoxin first identified in an E. coli of serogroup O 157 :H 7. In the present study, the PCR technique with primers detecting the verocytotoxin genes was shown to be a fast, sensitive and specific method to screen for and identify EHEC. The study contributes to the knowledge and understanding that also EHEC non-O 157 are pathogenic and that all verocytotoxin producing E. coli should be looked after among patients with diarrhoea, HC and HUS. 	The importance of quick identification was exemplified in an outbreak of EHEC among the staff at the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> <b>hospital</b> in Göteborg, Sweden. As the outbreak was promptly identified, partly thanks to the PCR technique, no further spread to other staff members or patients occurred. 	In the present thesis, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used and the method was shown to be very useful in the epidemiological work to separate single cases of EHEC from outbreaks. 	In order to further characterise EHEC non-O 157, the presence of additional chromosomal and plasmid genes probably involved in the pathogenesis were analysed as these genes have been found in EHEC O 157. The gene coding for intimin, enabling tight attachment to epithelial cells of the intestine was also often present among EHEC non-O 157. Moreover, the gene coding for an enterohemolysin possibly supporting the bacterial need for iron was especially often present among EHEC isolated from patients with severe symptoms. 	Further, the study has shown that the gene coding for aerobactin seems to be able to compensate for the absence of enterohemolysin and that also the type 1 fimbriae may be valuable to obtain a niche in the gut. 	A comparative study of verocytotoxin producing E. coli in cattle showed that there is a significantly lower amount of E. coli harbouring the intimin gene and the gene coding for aerobactin, supporting the assumption that not all verocytotoxin producing E. coli in cattle are pathogenic. 	In conclusion, methods identifying the verocytotoxines or their genes should be used to identify EHEC of all serogroups. PCR is preferable as it is a fast, sensitive and specific method. Genes coding for intimin, enterohemolysin and aerobactin adds to the pathogenicity of EHEC. These genes are not that common among isolates from cattle. PFGE is a most valuable tool for epidemiological tracing of EHEC...|$|R

40|$|O presente trabalho teve por objetivo compreender o significado que as professoras da Classe Hospitalar, de um {{hospital}} público infantil de São Paulo, atribuem ao seu trabalho. O termo Classe Hospitalar é reconhecido pela Secretaria de Educação Especial do Ministério da Educação e do Desporto (MEC/SEESP), e refere-se ao atendimento pedagógico-educacional a crianças e jovens, que ocorre em ambientes de tratamento de saúde, tanto em circunstância de internação como em atendimento em hospital-dia e hospital-semana ou em serviços de atenção integral à saúde mental. Participaram desta pesquisa três professoras que atuam em Classes Hospitalar de um hospital público infantil, a pelo menos um ano. Os dados foram coletados através de entrevistas semi-estruturadas e analisados a partir da perspectiva da abordagem qualitativa, por meio da análise de conteúdo. A coleta de dados foi realizada na instituição hospitalar em local e horário definidos pelas participantes. A partir dos dados coletados e do objetivo da pesquisa, foram definidos três núcleos temáticos: significado atribuídos ao trabalho pelas participantes; perspectivas de futuro das participantes; e contexto histórico de formação das participantes. A análise indicou que as professoras atribuem ao seu trabalho uma função que extrapola o papel de professor. Entretanto, as participantes relatam sentirem-se gratificadas e reconhecidas pela função que exercem, apesar de demonstrarem dificuldades em lidar com a situação socioeconômica dos pacientes e com possíveis óbitos. Em relação ao óbito de crianças, relatam afetá-las nas esferas profissionais, pessoais e familiares, o que provavelmente ocorre devido à falta de formação específica, à ausência de um trabalho interdisciplinar e de um serviço de apoio psicológico. Os resultados apontam para a necessidade de preparo específico para atuar no ambiente hospitalar e de incluir tais profissionais na equipe de saúdeThis aim of {{this study}} was to understand the significance that teachers in a Hospital Class, at a children's hospital in São Paulo, give to their work. The term Hospital Class is recognized by the Ministry of Education and Sport s (MEC/ SEESP) Bureau for Special Education, and refers to pedagogic-educational care for children and young people, which takes place in health-care environments, whether in cases of hospitalization, daily or weekly outpatient services or full mental health treatment. Three teachers who have worked in Hospital Classes at a public <b>children</b> <b>s</b> <b>hospital</b> for at least a year took place in this research. Data were collected through semistructured interviews and analyzed from a qualitative approach perspective, by analyzing content. Data was collected at the hospital at a time and place chosen by the participants. After examining the data and the purpose of the study, three main themes were identified: the importance that the participants attach to their work; prospects for the future of the participants, and the participants educational background. The analysis showed that the teachers believe their work has a role that goes beyond that of a mere teacher. However, the participants reported feeling satisfied and recognized for the duties they perform, despite finding it difficult to cope with the socioeconomic status of patients and with possible deaths. The deaths of child patients affect their professional, personal and family lives, which probably occurs because of the lack of specific training, interdisciplinary work and psychological support. The results demonstrate that there is a need for specific preparation for working in a hospital environment and such individuals should be included in the health care tea...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough <b>University.</b> <b>Children</b> are a unique and highly diverse group of people within society. However, engaging with <b>children</b> <b>s</b> voices has only recently become prominent in academic and international discourses. This thesis contributes to this engagement with <b>children</b> <b>s</b> voices by focusing on their experiences as shaped by oil extraction activities in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. While there is a vast body of literature on the implications of oil exploration activities in the region, {{little attention has been}} paid to children's lives. To counterbalance this tendency, this study aims to explore children's perceptions, experiences, and coping strategies in relation to the challenging circumstances of oil exploration operations in their communities. Adopting a critical perspective that views children as social actors with basic rights, this study also examines children's access to basic needs within the context of these oil industry operations. This research has used a quantitative and multi-qualitative methodological approach to data collection. Although <b>children</b> <b>s</b> voices are the study's focal point, the perceptions of adult stakeholders such as parents/carers, community leaders and oil company representatives were also used to explore <b>children</b> <b>s</b> lives and synthesize the discussions in the study. The results reveal that, while the Nigerian government has adopted the vocabulary enshrined in the UNCRC to enhance <b>children</b> <b>s</b> access to basic rights, in reality, the actions of the federal government and oil companies appear to be inconsistent with the fundamental principles of children's rights. Specifically, findings reveal that the adverse impacts of oil extraction activities have severely hampered <b>children</b> <b>s</b> lives and that, as a result, children have adopted harmful coping strategies. Additionally, by presenting the voices of children and adults separately, results show that children's views differed significantly from adult's perceptions on matters concerning children. The findings of this study relate the research to some of the key debates in children's geographies about children and childhood, especially within the context of the global South. This thesis argues that children are an integral part of society and that any meaningful strategy for development in the Niger Delta region must take into account their roles as social actors. Moreover, it must fully acknowledge the specific impacts that oil exploration activities have had on the lives of children in the communities affected and examine how these might be addressed...|$|R

40|$|Aims: The aims of {{this study}} were to 1) assess the {{incidence}} and prevalence of the 22 q 11 deletion syndrome(22 q 11 DS) in a defined population of western Sweden, 2) to evaluate the presenting phenotype and 3) to investigate the profile of cognitive and nervous system-related disabilities and the resulting handicap,taking into account physical, neurological and psychological aspects. Material and Methods: The incidence was studied in children born in the Western Götaland Region,where Göteborg is the main city, during the years 1991 - 2000. The prevalence was studied in children inthe region younger than 16 years {{at the end of the}} year 2000 (Paper I). The presenting phenotype wasevaluated in a consecutive series of 100 children and adolescents younger than 20 years with the 22 q 11 DSreferred from the whole of Sweden to the Queen Silvia <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> <b>Hospital</b> in Göteborg during the years 1993 - 2002 (Paper II). Photographs of 80 children were used to evaluate the pattern of characteristic facialfeatures (Paper III). In the first 33 patients older than three years, development, cognition, motor functionand the handicap level according to WHO (1980) were evaluated (Paper IV). All 113 patients included inthe study had 22 q 11 deletion confirmed by the fluorescence in situ hybridisation test. Results: The mean annual incidence in the whole region was 14. 1 per 100, 000 live births. During thefirst five years the incidence was higher, 18. 1 per 100, 000 live births for the whole region and 23. 4 per 100, 000 live births in Göteborg, where a multidisciplinary specialist team for the 22 q 11 DS is based. About 60 % had a heart defect and the median age at diagnosis was 0. 6 years compared with almost 7 years in those without a heart defect. The prevalence was 13. 2 per 100, 000 children below 16 years ofage in the whole region and 23. 3 per 100, 000 in Göteborg. The presenting phenotype was studied in 100 consecutive children. Twenty-six were diagnosed during infancy and 92 % of them had a congenitalheart defect, whereas 54 % of those diagnosed later had a cardiac defect. The median age at diagnosis was 6. 7 years. The typical presentation in those diagnosed early consisted of an association of conotruncalheart defect, hypocalcaemia and hypoplasia of thymus, whereas those diagnosed later most often presentedwith the association of speech-language impairment, developmental delay or learning difficulties andrecurrent infections. A characteristic pattern of mild facial features was noted in children at all ages. Ahigh prevalence of cognitive and other neurologically related impairments was found. Hypotonia, coordinationdisturbance and poor balance were found in most patients. Around two-thirds had definitemotor problems, including two with spastic hemiplegia. Deviant pre-walking locomotion and delayedindependent walking and delayed achievement of bladder control were also common findings. Most hadan IQ below 85, and an IQ below 70 was found in one-third of the children. Performance IQ was moreimpaired than Verbal IQ. As a consequence of these and other associated problems, the resulting handicapwas considerable. Conclusion: The 22 q 11 deletion syndrome is a common genetic disorder. In spite of variable clinicalexpression, children with the disorder share a number of major features and have a characteristicphenotype. A high proportion has no cardiac defect and hence a diagnostic delay. Increased awareness andknowledge among specialists who meet these children early in life is needed to reduce the diagnostic delay. The comprehensive management of a child with the 22 q 11 DS is challenging because of the wide spectrumand variable expression of impairments and disabilities which, taken together, manifest as a considerablehandicap. A multi-professional approach and an individualised assessment are necessary to give the childadequate treatment and support...|$|R

Anthropometric measures were collected to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity of children enrolled in Merced County Head Start. To assess maternal figures perceptions of their <b>child</b> <b>s</b> weight status, maternal figures were asked to complete a self- administered questionnaire. The questionnaire included items that examined maternal figures perception of their <b>child</b> <b>s</b> weight status, their concern regarding their <b>child</b> <b>s</b> weight status and physical activity, and their feeling of degree of control over their <b>child</b> <b>s</b> dietary habits and physical activity.

40|$|Objectives: {{review the}} literature, {{exploring}} {{factors that contribute}} to the development of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> eating behavior such as the role of learning and social context. Methods: the review of the literature was done using Medline, Psyclit, and Lilacs as resources for assessing international and national research articles on child nutrition, with an emphasis on <b>children</b> <b>s</b> eating behavior. These articles were revised and grouped together according to the topic. Results: family is responsible for the development of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> eating behavior through social learning. Parents are <b>children</b> <b>s</b> first nutritional educators. <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> eating experiences are influenced by cultural and psychosocial factors. Social context plays a relevant role in this process, especially through the strategies used by parents to encourage children to have a balanced diet and to eat specific foods. These strategies may contain adequate and inadequate stimuli as to the development of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> food preference and food intake self-control. Conclusion: the learning process is a determining factor for <b>children</b> <b>s</b> eating behavior, and is associated with three factors: food flavor conditioning, food postingestional consequences, and social context. Parents are deeply concerned with the amount of food their children eat and not with the development of more adequate habits and attitudes related to dietary quality. J. pediatr.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The HIV {{epidemic}} in South Africa has increased {{not only the}} number of ill children but also the number of orphans. Although the establishment of orphanages is not sustainable, the number of residential care facilities continues to increase. Many persons working in South African <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes can testify to the impact HIV has had on this sector, but no studies have actually measured it. AIMS The primary aim {{of this research was}} to determine the impact of HIV on the Johannesburg <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes. The secondary aims were to make recommendations informed by this research to assist <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes to mitigate the impact and to inform the activities of the <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> Homes Outreach Medical Programme (CHOMP). METHODS A rapid appraisal of all <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes in the greater Johannesburg was done by means of a telephonic survey. This was followed by an in depth analysis of 24 <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes through the use of questionnaires, data collection forms, a pop quiz for residential child care workers and the inspection of facilities. RESULTS A total of 115 residential care facilities with a population (excluding the special needs homes) of 5 934 were identified. In a sample of 24 homes, 31, 7...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. To assess {{generalizability}} of the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation (BARI), we conducted a separate study comparing revascularization in U. <b>S.</b> and BARI <b>hospitals.</b> Background. The BARI trial is a multicenter investigation comparing initial revascularization with {{percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty}} and coronary bypass graft surgery in patients with symptomatic multivessel coronary disease. Methods. All revascularization procedures during 5 consecutive workdays were surveyed at 75 U. <b>S.</b> <b>hospitals</b> offering coronary angioplasty and bypass surgery and at all BARI hospitals. Data collected were demographics, extent of disease and type of current and previous revascularization. Results. At both U. <b>S.</b> and BARI <b>hospitals,</b> 57 % of all revascularization procedures were coronary angioplasty and 43 % were bypass surgery. The U. <b>S.</b> <b>hospitals</b> had m ore patients with single-vessel disease, acute myocardial infarction and primary procedures. Other characteristics were similar. The majority of revascularization procedures were angioplasty for single-vessel disease (U. S. 32 % vs. BARI 25 %) and bypass surgery for triple-vessel disease (U. S. 31 % vs. BARI 31 %). Overall, the choice between bypass surgery and angioplasty was similar in BARI and U. <b>S.</b> <b>hospitals</b> (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1. 0, p = 0. 914). However, older patients were more likely and younger patients less likely to undergo bypass surgery in BARI versus U. <b>S.</b> <b>hospitals</b> (older patients: adjusted OR 1. 6, p = 0. 031; younger patients: adjusted OR 0. 6, p = 0. 028). The BARI protocol would have excluded 65 % of all candidates for revascularization, for whom indications already exist for angioplasty or bypass surgery, and another 23 %, for whom angioplasty would be contraindicated for individual lesions. Conclusions. Patients undergoing coronary revascularization in BARI and U. <b>S.</b> <b>hospitals</b> were generally similar, as was the choice between types of revascularization. Results from the BARI trial apply to ∼ 300 (12 %) candidates for coronary revascularization/workday...|$|R
40|$|Industrial {{experts agree}} that cloud {{computing}} can significantly improve business and public access to low cost computing power and storage. Despite the benefits of cloud computing, recent research surveys indicated that its adoption in U. <b>S.</b> <b>hospitals</b> is slower than expected. The {{purpose of this study}} was to understand what factors influence cloud adoption in U. <b>S.</b> <b>hospitals.</b> The theoretical foundation of the research was the diffusion of innovations and technology-organization-environment framework. The research question was to examine the predictability of cloud computing adoption for U. <b>S.</b> <b>hospitals</b> as a function of 6 influential factors: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, organizational size, structure, and culture. The research methodology included a cross-sectional survey with an existing validated questionnaire. A stratified random sample of 118 information technology managers from qualified U. <b>S.</b> <b>hospitals</b> completed the questionnaire. The categorical regression analysis rendered F statistics and R 2 values to test the predictive models. The research results revealed that all 6 influential factors had significant correlations with the public cloud adoption intent (adjusted R 2 =. 583) while only the 3 technological factors had significant correlations with the private cloud adoption intent (adjusted R 2 =. 785). The recommendation is to include environmental factors and increase sample size in the similar future research. The developed predictive models provided a clearer understanding among hospital IT executives and cloud service providers of cloud adoption drivers. The potential implications for positive social change can be the increase of efficiency and effectiveness in U. <b>S.</b> <b>hospital</b> operation once their speed of cloud adoption has increased...|$|R
