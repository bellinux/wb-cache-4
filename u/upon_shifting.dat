40|$|The Caulobacter polar surface {{structures}} (flagella, pili, and the {{deoxyribonucleic acid}} phage φCbK receptors), which are expressed at proximal sites of swarmer cells in a coordinate manner (Shapiro, Annu. Rev. Microbiol., 30 : 377 - 407, 1976) could be {{blocked by a}} single mutation. The mutant C. crescentus CB 13 ple- 801 did not form these surface structures when grown at 35 °C. <b>Upon</b> <b>shift</b> down to 25 °C, the mutant cells initiated {{the formation of the}} surface structures. When mitomycin C was added to the mutant culture <b>upon</b> <b>shift</b> down from 35 to 25 °C, φCbK receptor formation was inhibited to a minimal level. Rifampin and chloramphenicol completely inhibited φCbK receptor formation when added to the mutant culture <b>upon</b> <b>shift</b> down. Deoxyribonucleic acid as well as ribonucleic acid and protein synthesis seem to be required for the formation of φCbK receptors. Penicillin V also inhibited φCbK receptor formation, indicating the involvement of cell wall synthesis. When the mutant CB 13 ple- 801 cells were shifted down briefly from 35 to 25 °C and then shifted up to 35 °C, flagella and φCbK receptors were formed even at 35 °C to different extents depending on how long the cells were incubated at 25 °C. This formation of the surface structures at 35 °C was inhibited by rifampin. From these results, it appears that translation, assembly, or localization processes for the formation of the surface structures are not temperature sensitive at 35 °C in the pleiotropic mutant CB 13 ple- 801. The syntheses of deoxyribonucleic acid and the cell wall {{do not appear to be}} temperature sensitive either, since the mutant grows normally at 35 °C. It is suggested that there exists a regulatory step that commits the cells to initiate the synthesis of requisite ribonucleic acid for the formation of the polar surface structures...|$|R

We report the first documented fabG mutants and their characterization. By chemical mutagenesis followed by a tritium suicide procedure, we obtained three conditionally lethal temperature-sensitive fabG mutants. The Escherichia coli [fabG (Ts) ] mutant contains two point mutations: A 154 T and E 233 K. The β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase activity of this mutant was extremely thermolabile, {{and the rate of}} fatty acid synthesis measured in vivo was inhibited <b>upon</b> <b>shift</b> to the nonpermissive temperature. Moreover, synthesis of the acyl-ACP intermediates of the pathway was inhibited <b>upon</b> <b>shift</b> of mutant cultures to the nonpermissive temperature, indicating blockage of the synthetic cycle. Similar results were observed for in vitro fatty acid synthesis. Complementation analysis revealed that only the E 233 K mutation was required to give the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype. In the two Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium fabG(Ts) mutants one strain had a single point mutation, S 224 F, whereas the second strain contained two mutations (M 125 I and A 223 T). All of the altered residues of the FabG mutant proteins are located on or near the twofold axes of symmetry at the dimer interfaces in this homotetrameric protein, suggesting that the quaternary structures of the mutant FabG proteins may be disrupted at the nonpermissive temperature...|$|R
