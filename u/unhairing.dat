50|$|The {{weakening}} of hair {{is dependent on}} the breakdown of the disulfide link of the amino acid cystine, which is the characteristic of the keratin class of proteins that gives strength to hair and wools (keratin typically makes up 90% of the dry weight of hair). The hydrogen atoms supplied by the sharpening agent weaken the cystine molecular link whereby the covalent disulfide bond links are ultimately ruptured, weakening the keratin. To some extent, sharpening also contributes to <b>unhairing,</b> as it tends to break down the hair proteins.|$|E

It {{is used in}} chemical manufacturing as a sulfonation and sulfomethylation agent. It {{is used in the}} production of rubber chemicals, sulfur dyes and other chemical compounds. It is used in other applications including ore flotation, oil recovery, making dyes, and detergent. It is also used for leather processing in liming operation as <b>unhairing</b> agent.|$|E
50|$|Because {{aggressive}} bases like KOH {{damage the}} cuticle {{of the hair}} shaft, potassium hydroxide is used to chemically assist the removal of hair from animal hides. The hides are soaked for several hours in a solution of KOH and water {{to prepare them for}} the <b>unhairing</b> stage of the tanning process. This same effect is also used to weaken human hair in preparation for shaving. Pre-shave products and some shave creams contain potassium hydroxide to force open the hair cuticle and to act as a hygroscopic agent to attract and force water into the hair shaft, causing further damage to the hair. In this weakened state, the hair is more easily cut by a razor blade.|$|E
50|$|Keratin that {{is present}} in the hair, scales and in the {{epidermis}} of the skin is hydrolyzed in the presence of alkali (at pH values greater than 11.5). The disulfide bridges found in keratin protein are cleaved but can be reformed. Long periods of liming will result in hair removal. The main removal of keratin is performed using the <b>unhairing</b> operation. In traditional processing liming/unhairing was indivisible and took place at the same time. Modern liming methods, and in particular, the processing of sheepskins the hair is removed first and then limed in a liming drum. In hair-save technology, the hides are unhaired first and then limed for a further 12-18 hours.|$|E
50|$|During the Medieval era tanning was {{considered}} a skilled trade and was second to wool as a textile fabric. During this period the first job of a tanner was to wash hides free of blood, manure and other curing materials before being rehydrated. To accomplish this task a nearby river or stream was often used. Other methods for this task would include trampling on the hides with feet or pounding on the material with hammers. Upon this task's completion, the hides were then set with the hair side up to remove the hair without damaging the surface. To loosen the hair it was common to either let the leather become putrid or by speeding up the process with liquors such as stale beer, fermented barley or mulberry, dung or bryony leaves. Soaking skins in liquors prepared with wood ash or lime would accomplish a similar effect. When the skin was deemed adequetely prepared it would be stretched over a beam and scraped. The hair side would be scraped with a blunt, single edge <b>unhairing</b> knife and the flesh with a sharper, two-edge fleshing knife. The process would continue with another soaking and scraping with a blunt scudding knife. The {{next step in the}} process was to wash the skin further and then add an alkaline bating to remove excess lime and create a softer, finer grain. After repeating this step, the skin would be laid over the beam once more to remove any of the waste products that were released in the process often referenced as slime. After the skin {{was considered}} cleaned and prepared it was ready for the tanning process. This would occur by placing the skin in a pit on top of ground tanning material, then covered by additional ground tanning material, and the process would be repeated until the pit was nearly full. Tanning materials were dependent on the local landscape and were most often tree matter (oak, birch, willow, spruce, etc.). Upon filling the pit with the skins, the pit would be filled with cold water or another mixture and the skins were left to sit for close to a year. When a tanner judged that the leather was sufficiently tanned, the skins were removed, rinsed, and smoothed with a knife before being slowly dried in a dark space. At the point that the leather is dried, it is sold to a currier for additional processing.|$|E

However proteases can be relatively non-specific in their usage, and for improved efficacy of enzyme biocatalysis within the industry, an analysis of specific activities of enzymes towards skin proteins was undertaken.

40|$|Hides and skins {{used as a}} raw {{material}} for leather manufacture may be contaminated with various microbial species including potential pathogens. Many bacterial species such as Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Micrococcus and Pseudomonas were isolated from raw hides/skins, and hides/skins {{at different stages of}} leather making process. The extreme environmental conditions present during a conventional tanning process due to hazardous chemicals may prevent the growth of bacteria present on hides/skins. On the other hand, partial or total replacement of the hazardous chemicals with non-hazardous chemicals, during a best available technologies (BAT) process, may provide suitable conditions for microbial growth in tannery effluent and hides/skins. Therefore, the aim of the project was to determine the survival and growth of the various bacterial species during the conventional and BAT leather-making processes. The beamhouse and tanning stages were studied, as the majority of the environmental pollution occurs during {{the early stages of the}} leather making process. Both the pre-soaking and soaking stages during the conventional and BAT leather-making processes provided suitable conditions for bacterial (Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus spp.) growth and proliferation. The results showed a significant reduction in the number of B. cereus found during the conventional and BAT <b>unhairing</b> processes. Limited B. cereus growth was observed during the subsequent reliming process. Bacillus cereus growth also occurred during the deliming and bating processes (conventional and BAT), followed by a decrease during the conventional and BAT pickling processes. No B. cereus colonies were isolated during the chrome tanning process. Growth of P. aeruginosa was inhibited during both the <b>unhairing</b> and reliming stages of the conventional and BAT leather making processes. A reappearance and recovery of P. aeruginosa in the subsequent deliming and bating (conventional and BAT) processes, indicated that deliming and bating processes may provide suitable growth conditions for P. aeruginosa. On the other hand, both the conventional and BAT pickling processes, and the chrome tanning processes hindered P. aeruginosa growth. Staphylococcus spp. were present throughout the conventional and BAT leather-making processes. A large reduction in the number of Staphylococcus spp. was observed during the <b>unhairing</b> and reliming processes (conventional and BAT). Growth of Staphylococcus spp. occurred during the subsequent deliming, bating, pickling and chrome tanning stages for both the conventional and BAT leather-making processes. The biochemical assays for bacterial identification confirmed the presence of B. cereus, P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus spp. during the leather processing. The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) method of DNA fingerprinting confirmed that the bacterial species isolated during the leather manufacturing processes were the inoculated B. cereus and P. aeruginosa, and no alteration of the DNA of above-mentioned bacteria occurred during the processing.

And as the lime has a limited solublitiy of 0. 125 %, undissolved lime always remains in solution; this undissolved lime will dissolve when its equilibrium solubility is disturbed by recycling. It has been observed that the <b>unhairing</b> power of the old lime liquor was more effective than the fresh liquor; {{this is due to the}} fact that the disulphide link of the hair is broken and dissolved during the liming process and consequently the sulphide content will build-up through recycling.
