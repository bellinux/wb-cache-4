5|$|Another American {{tradition}} {{is that of}} an apolitical military, although this custom was of more recent origin, dating back only to the period after the American Civil War. Few officers voted in the 19th century, {{but not so much}} from a lack of interest in politics as because frequently moving from state to state and living on Federal land effectively disenfranchised them <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> of many states. Under General of the Army William T. Sherman, the Commanding General of the United States Army from 1869 to 1883, who hated politics, this custom of an apolitical military became firmly established.|$|E
5|$|Before abdicating, Celestine re-enacted Ubi Periculum, the Apostolic Constitution of Pope Gregory X, {{which has}} governed all {{subsequent}} papal elections <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> of the conclave.

5|$|International law {{requires}} that every merchant ship be registered in a country. The country in which a ship is registered is its flag state, and the flag state gives the ship the right to fly its civil ensign. A ship's flag state exercises regulatory control over the vessel and is required to inspect it regularly, certify the ship's equipment and crew, and issue safety and pollution prevention documents. A ship operates <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> of its flag state, and these laws are used if the ship is involved in an admiralty case. The organization which actually registers the ship is known as its registry. Registries may be governmental or private agencies.|$|E

5|$|Michael J. McGivney, an Irish-American Catholic priest, {{founded the}} Knights of Columbus in New Haven, Connecticut. He {{gathered}} {{a group of}} men from St. Mary's Parish for an organizational meeting on October 2, 1881. Several months later, the Order was incorporated <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> of the state of Connecticut on March 29, 1882; this was during the Golden age of fraternalism in the United States, when numerous civic, religious and ethnic associations were being founded. Although its first councils were all in Connecticut, the Order spread throughout New England and the United States in subsequent years. By 1889, there were 300 councils comprising 40,000 knights. Twenty years later, in 1909, there were 230,000 knights in 1,300 councils.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} years of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era that followed, Congress {{repeatedly}} debated the rights of the millions of black former slaves. By 1869, amendments had been passed to abolish slavery and provide citizenship and equal protection <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws,</b> but the election of Ulysses S. Grant to the presidency in 1868 convinced a majority of Republicans that protecting the franchise of black male voters was important for the party's future. On February 26, 1869, after rejecting more sweeping versions of a suffrage amendment, Congress proposed a compromise amendment banning franchise restrictions on the basis of race, color, or previous servitude. After surviving a difficult ratification fight, the amendment was certified as duly ratified and part of the Constitution on March 30, 1870.|$|E
5|$|Wales – {{which had}} been conquered centuries earlier, but had {{remained}} a separate dominion – was annexed to England <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Laws</b> in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. Henry VIII's son and successor, the young Edward VI, continued with further religious reforms, but his early death in 1553 precipitated a succession crisis. He was wary of allowing his Catholic elder half-sister Mary I to succeed, and therefore drew up a will designating Lady Jane Grey as his heiress. Jane's reign, however, lasted only nine days; with tremendous popular support, Mary deposed her and declared herself the lawful sovereign. Mary I married Philip of Spain, who was declared king and co-ruler, pursued disastrous wars in France, and attempted to return England to Roman Catholicism, burning Protestants at the stake as heretics in the process. Upon her death in 1558, the pair were succeeded by her Protestant half-sister Elizabeth I. England returned to Protestantism and continued its growth into a major world power by building its navy and exploring the New World.|$|E

6000|$|For the first, THAT THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE <b>UNDER</b> <b>THE</b> <b>LAW,</b> OR <b>UNDER</b> <b>THE</b> COVENANT OF WORKS, see, I pray you, that Scripture in the Third of the Romans, {{where the}} Apostle, {{speaking}} before of sins against <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> and of <b>the</b> denunciations thereof against {{those that are}} in that condition, he saith, [...] "What things soever <b>the</b> <b>law</b> saith, it saith to them who are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law"; mark, [...] "it saith to them who are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world become guilty before God" [...] (Rom 3:19). That is, all those that are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> as a Covenant of Works, that are yet in their sins, and unconverted, as I told you before. Again he saith, [...] "But if ye be led by the Spirit, ye are not <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law" [...] (Gal 5:18). Implying again, that those which are for sinning against <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> or <b>the</b> works of <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> either {{as it is the}} old covenant, these are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> and not <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Covenant of Grace. Again he saith, [...] "For as many as are of the works of <b>the</b> <b>law</b> are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> curse" [...] (Gal 3:10). That is, they that are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> curse; for mark, they that are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Covenant of Grace are not <b>under</b> <b>the</b> curse. Now, there are but two covenants, therefore, it must needs be that they that are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> curse are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> seeing those that are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> other covenant are not <b>under</b> <b>the</b> curse, but <b>under</b> <b>the</b> blessing. [...] "So, then, they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham," [...] but <b>the</b> rest are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> (Gal 3:9).|$|R
5|$|Each {{member of}} the Order, {{including}} the Sovereign, is allotted a stall in the Chapel, above which his or her heraldic devices are displayed. Perched on the pinnacle of a knight's stall is his helm, decorated with mantling and topped by his crest. If he is a peer, the coronet appropriate to his rank is placed beneath the helm. <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> of heraldry, women, other than monarchs, do not normally bear helms nor crests; instead, the coronet alone is used (if she is a peeress or princess). Lady Marion Fraser had a helm and crest included when she was granted arms; these are displayed above her stall {{in the same manner}} as for knights. Unlike other British Orders, the armorial banners of Knights and Ladies of the Thistle are not hung in the chapel, but instead in an adjacent part of St Giles High Kirk. The Thistle Chapel does, however, bear the arms of members living and deceased on stall plates. These enamelled plates are affixed to the back of the stall and display its occupant's name, arms, and date of admission into the Order.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, {{maintenance}} of I-84 in downstate New York was {{transferred from the}} New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to the New York State Thruway Authority (NYSTA). The monies for that purpose came from tolls levied on I-190 in downtown Buffalo. <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> authorizing the Thruway construction, the tolls were to be removed once the original bonds {{used to pay for}} the construction were paid off, which occurred in 1996; however, the tolls would remain for ten more years. Attorney Carl Paladino brought a lawsuit against the state in 2006 to force the removal of the tolls. On October 30, 2006, the Thruway Authority voted to both begin the process of returning {{maintenance of}} I-84 to NYSDOT and to remove the tolls on I-190 in Buffalo. Collection of the tolls stopped that day. Both major candidates in the 2006 New York gubernatorial election, Democrat Eliot Spitzer and Republican John Faso, had pledged to remove the tolls on I-190 if elected. While the toll barriers in Buffalo have since been demolished, the tolls further north on the two Grand Island bridges still remain.|$|E
