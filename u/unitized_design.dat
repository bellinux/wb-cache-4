40|$|Polyphenols are {{functional}} {{compounds in}} plants, which possess many bioactivities beneficial for humans. The {{aim of this}} study was to establish a highly efficient method for extracting polyphenol compounds from areca seeds and further to identify polyphenols and antioxidant properties of the seeds. A quadratic general rotary <b>unitized</b> <b>design</b> was used to determine the optimal extraction process. The polyphenols were identified using LC-TOF-MS. By comparison with ascorbic acid (Vc), the antioxidant activities of the ethanol extracts were evaluated using three complementary in vitro assays: inhibition of the DPPH (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl) radical-scavenging activity, hydroxyl radical-scavenging activity, and reducing ability. The two major polyphenols obtained were epicatechin and syringic acid. The ethanol extracts of areca seeds showed significantly greater antioxidant activity (p < 0. 05) than Vc using the DPPH and reducing power assay, but lower ability (p < 0. 05) using the hydroxyl radical assay. The results indicate that the areca seed is an excellent food material with potential antioxidant properties...|$|E

Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory (DOE/NETL) entitled ''Tape Calendering Manufacturing Process For Multilayer Thin-Film Solid Oxide Fuel Cells''. The main {{objective of this}} project was to develop the manufacturing process based on tape calendering for multilayer solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC's) using the <b>unitized</b> cell <b>design</b> concept and to demonstrate cell performance under specified operating conditions. Summarized in this report is the development and improvements to multilayer SOFC cells and the <b>unitized</b> cell <b>design.</b> Improvements to the multilayer SOFC cell were made in electrochemical performance, in both the anode and cathode, with cells demonstrating power densities of nearly 0. 9 W/cm{sup 2 } for 650 C operation and other cell configurations showing greater than 1. 0 W/cm{sup 2 } at 75 % fuel utilization and 800 C. The <b>unitized</b> cell <b>design</b> was matured through design, analysis and development testing {{to a point that}} cell operation at greater than 70 % fuel utilization was demonstrated at 800 C. The manufacturing process for both the multilayer cell and <b>unitized</b> cell <b>design</b> were assessed and refined, process maps were developed, forming approaches explored, and nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques examined...|$|R

40|$|A direct borohydride/hydrogen {{peroxide}} fuel cell, {{employing a}} misch-metal alloy anode and carbon-supported lead sulfate $(PbSO_ 4 /C) $ cathode with a Nafion®- 961 membrane electrolyte, is reported. The {{use of a}} Nafion®- 961 membrane electrolyte in the fuel cell lessens the crossover of aqueous sodium hydroxide from the anode to cathode.

The fuel cell also avoids the use of noble-metal catalysts. The unique combination of sodium borohydride and hydrogen peroxide, both of which are in aqueous from, paves the way for a convenient <b>unitized</b> refueling <b>design</b> that is inherently compact compared to fuel cells that use gaseous reactants.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effect of}} trace {{elements}} on methanogenesis was investigated during mixed anaerobic fermentation using a single-factor experiment in the present study. The most effective concentrations of Fe 0, Fe 2 +, Co 2 + and Ni 2 + that were added were 1500, 250, 0. 3 and 0. 6 mg/L, respectively. The optimal trace element combination was 0. 58 mg/L Ni 2 +, 1200 mg/L Fe 0 and 0. 34 mg/L Co 2 + by the ternary quadratic general rotary <b>unitized</b> <b>design</b> method. The degree of influence exerted by trace elements on the cumulative methane yields decreased {{in the order of}} Ni 2 +, Fe 0 and Co 2 +, and the maximum CH 4 yield was 241. 6 mL/g volatile solids (VS), according to a regression equation. The non-dissolved organic carbon hydrolytic process showed a good fit with the first-order kinetic model. The maximum value of CH 4 was 312. 87 mL/g VS. Compared to the control, the bioconversion efficiencies of CH 4 and CO 2 production increased by 36. 76 % and 74. 50 %, respectively, at the optimal trace element combination. The obtained results provide new knowledge for improvements in the efficiency of anaerobic fermentation biogas production...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1997 This {{dissertation}} creates {{and tests}} a communication methodology, focused on ecological <b>unitizing,</b> <b>designed</b> to enable upper {{elementary school students}} to generate their own appropriate learning goals. A communication methodology provides a mechanism by which persons can design their own communication practices (methods, strategies, options) {{to meet the demands}} of situations for which the communication methodology is constructed. When ecologically unitizing, an active perceiver views a chosen situation holistically for a particular purpose by discovering and selecting pertinent information elements and the relationships among them necessary to describe the situation. This dissertation focuses on teachers and students as active communicators who use a communication methodology to discover, adapt, and integrate many pertinent fragments of accessible information into ecological units to enable students to generate their own learning goals. The perspective of human communication underlying this research links Buber's dialogic perspective of making the other present (Friedman, 1976) with Foss and Griffin's (1995) Invitational Rhetoric and with Maturana and Varela's (1970, 1987) biological perspective which explains the communication of social life as human structural coupling. These perspectives are linked by Krippendorff's (1993) emphasis on cognitive autonomy, reflexive communication and moral responsibility. The communication methodology as designed was tested with fourth through sixth grade students from August 1996 through March 1997. Eleven children participated in 14 semi-structured interviews. Data was analyzed in the qualitative cognitive tradition, using the constant comparative method (Glaser, 1967) to move between coding and theoretical categories. Extensive exemplification is included. A communication methodology provides a generator through which the communication methodology works. The generator in this communication methodology, the Interrogational Function, includes a question word (who, what, when, where, why, how) and a focus on one or more factor of Burke's (1975) Pentad (act, agent, agency, purpose, scene). A child's information about self, background, and interests is coded into the categories of agent, purpose, and scene. The relationships the child describes among these elements are viewed as agency, the means through which the child creates the learning goal. The child focuses and tightens his or her ecological units, successfully producing the learning goal, the child's act of creation...|$|R
5000|$|A {{redesign}} {{changed the}} Falcon's looks for 1964. The new look was more squared-off, more modern, as Ford pursued the youth market. Later in 1964, Ford's new offering for that market was launched: the Ford Mustang, based {{heavily on the}} Falcon's <b>unitized</b> frame <b>design</b> but with no compromises about its youthful, fun intention. TV commercials now used the character Hazel {{as well as the}} Peanuts cartoon characters. The Ford Motor Company was a sponsor of the show, and also sponsored The Ford Show during the late 1950s. For the 1964 year, Ford added a Sprint Package, which gave the Falcon the 260 V8, a stiffer suspension, and a louder exhaust. Because the Mustang had the same options that the Sprint had for only a small amount more, the Sprint never caught on. Even with the addition of the 289 V8 in late '64, the Sprint was overshadowed by the Mustang, and was discontinued after 1965. The Mustang dealt Falcon sales in North America a blow from which they would never recover. Front suspension was coil springs pivot-mounted on upper arms plus double-acting absorbers. [...] Six-cylinder cars had four-lug hubs with 13-in steel wheels. V-8 cars got five-lug wheels. For 1965, changes were minimal, including a simpler grille and revised side trim on deluxe models. Production ended on June 26, 1965, for convertible Falcons. A padded instrument panel, seat belts, power steering, power brakes, a radio, a remote-control trunk release, and a parking brake warning light were optional.|$|R
5000|$|In April 1939, the RLM asked Junkers for {{a further}} {{development}} of the Ju 90 for military transport purposes. The Ju 90V5 and V6 were the prototypes of this military design. They got a new wing with a straight inner section leading edge, of greater span (19%) and area (11%). The landing gear was strengthened with twin main-wheels and the fins were more rounded, lacking the characteristic horn balance nick of the earlier models. The windows were replaced by 10 small portholes a side. The Ju 90 V5 flew first on 5 December 1939. A special feature of both the V5 and V6 was a powerful boarding ramp in {{the floor of the}} rear section of the fuselage for loading cars and larger cargo freight. This Trapoklappe ramp, when lowered, was powerful enough to raise the fuselage to the horizontal flying position. Both aircraft were retroactively fitted with the much more powerful, Kraftei (power-egg) unitized mounting 1,200 kW (1,600 hp) BMW 801MA radials, with the first suffix letter [...] "M" [...] signifying the initial Motoranlage format of <b>unitized</b> powerplant installation <b>design</b> promulgated by the RLM.

The {{primary goal of}} this test article is to prove that PRSEUS components are capable of carrying combined loads that are representative of a hybrid wing body pressure cabin design regime. This paper summarizes the analytical approach, analysis results, and failure predictions of the test article. A global finite element model of composite panels, metallic fittings, mechanical fasteners, and the Combined Loads Test System (COLTS) test fixture was used to conduct linear structural strength and stability analyses to validate the specimen under the most critical combination of bending and pressure loading conditions found in the hybrid wing body pressure cabin. Local detail analyses were also performed at locations with high stress concentrations, at Tee-cap noodle interfaces with surrounding laminates, and at fastener locations with high bearing/bypass loads. Failure predictions for different composite and metallic failure modes were made, and nonlinear analyses were also performed to study the structural response of the test article under combined bending and pressure loading. This large-scale specimen test will be conducted at the COLTS facility at the NASA Langley Research Center...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to analyze and predict the influence of damage containment features that enhance damage tolerance in unitized structures, and to characterize the internal three dimensional crack growth behavior in integrally stiffened panels. To accomplish these research goals, both surface and internal crack growth were measured and analyzed, and a new analysis concept method was introduced to characterize the internal crack growth behavior. ^ Unitized structure {{is an important issue}} in the aerospace industry, since it has a significant economic advantage. There are, however, potential damage tolerance problems. Damage Containment Features (DCF), that retard or arrest fatigue crack growth, are one proposed solution for enhanced damage tolerance in unitized structures. For DCF design applications, it is essential to understand the relation between surface and internal fatigue crack growth behavior for obtaining maximum structural advantage. ^ Four DCF configurations were fatigue tested to investigate the characteristics of the surface and internal fatigue crack growth behavior in unitized structures. The results of surface and internal crack growth analyses clearly showed the characteristic reduction in fatigue crack growth rate as the crack grows into DCF. Subsequent stress intensity factors analysis also supported this DCF effect. A parametric study with various DCF geometries suggested a design factor that might be considered in <b>designing</b> <b>unitized</b> structures. The study suggested that internal fatigue crack shape change patterns could be determined by employing an Ellipse model approach. Moreover, these reconstructed elliptic crack model could provide the numerical representations of crack fronts for FEM analyses. ^ The results of this study are used to characterize and explain surface and internal fatigue crack growth behavior in unitized structures. All of the experimental data analyses were presented in tabular forms and figures. ...|$|R
40|$|In this industrialized world, {{technology}} has invaded our life {{in such a}} level where behind every product a complex manufacturing process with high transportation costs being hidden. Designing a product itself is not enough anymore; the whole manufacturing procedure needs {{to be included in}} the design. Especially when product design meets acoustic engineering, the design should not only fulfil the acoustic and aesthetic qualities but also take into consideration the cost factor. This is translated into the wise use of material, transportation, easy assembly and maintenance. At the same time, the target group is every single person that is called to participate in the assembly procedure, with no expertise knowledge, which adds extra challenge in the design procedure. Less is more, as Mies van der Rohe stated. This research taking a step back and revaluates the product design principle for acoustic panels. Having as starting point the HELIX panel designed by Panayiotis Hadjisergis and Ioanna Christia, during Bucky Lab course of 2015 fall, the target is to keep the advantages of this panel while improving the acoustic performance and keeping the manufacturing process as simple as possible. The target of Helix panel was to provide a flexible solution regarding acoustics and assembly. The advantages of this project were further developed into the STRAWS project. The acoustic principle used is quarter wavelength tubes and combined to a cheap ordinary product, as straws, a broadband sound absorbing <b>unitized</b> panel is <b>designed.</b> Until now there are lots of products that are made for acoustic but none of them fullfil so many different design needs. This research proposes an already existing product which by implementing acoustic principles, can be applied in open-plan officess.
