5|$|The film {{received}} mixed reviews.

5|$|The main {{pyramid of}} Sahure's {{mortuary}} complex exemplifies {{the decline of}} pyramid building, {{both in terms of}} size and quality. Yet, the accompanying mortuary temple is considered to be the most sophisticated one built <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|Acting on James Bevel's {{call for}} a march from Selma to Montgomery, King, Bevel, and the SCLC, in partial {{collaboration}} with SNCC, attempted to organize the march to the state's capital. The first attempt to march on March 7, 1965, was aborted because of mob and police violence against the demonstrators.

50|$|During the 1970s, Kulmer {{created the}} sets and costumes for two films.

5|$|Al-Zarqali (1028–1087) {{developed}} {{a more accurate}} astrolabe, used for centuries afterwards. He constructed a water clock in Toledo. He discovered that the Sun's apogee moves slowly relative to the fixed stars, and obtained a good estimate of its motion for its rate of change. Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201–1274) wrote an important revision to Ptolemy's celestial model. When he became Helagu's astrologer, he was given an observatory and gained access to Chinese techniques and observations. He developed trigonometry as a separate field, and compiled the most accurate astronomical tables available <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

He even became a Franciscan tertiary, according to the Greater Legend of his saintly sister, Elisabeth.|$|E
5|$|During {{the run of}} Patience, Carte {{built the}} large, modern Savoy Theatre, which became the partnership's {{permanent}} home.
