5|$|In 1912, Frank {{was elected}} {{president}} of the Atlanta chapter of the B'nai B'rith, a Jewish fraternal organization. The Jewish community in Atlanta was the largest in the Southern United States, and the Franks belonged to a cultured and philanthropic social environment whose leisure pursuits included opera and bridge. Although the Southern <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> specifically known for its antisemitism, Frank's northern culture and Jewish faith added to the sense that he was different.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, {{criticism}} {{over the}} Johnson Administration's {{handling of the}} Vietnam War began to grow, with Ford and Congressional Republicans expressing concern that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> doing what was necessary to win the war. Public sentiment also began to move against Johnson, and the 1966 midterm elections saw a 47-seat swing {{in favor of the}} Republicans. This was not enough to give Republicans a majority in the House, but the victory gave Ford the opportunity to prevent the passage of further Great Society programs.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} days before the {{entrance}} of the United States into World War I, the US military was concerned that Germany was planning to purchase or seize the Danish West Indies for use as a submarine or zeppelin base. At the time, Charlotte Amalie on Saint Thomas was considered the best port in the Caribbean outside of Cuba, and Coral Bay on Saint John was considered the safest harbor in the area. Although the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> yet at war with Germany, the US signed a treaty to purchase the territory from Denmark for 25 million dollars on March 28, 1917. President Woodrow Wilson nominated James Harrison Oliver to be the first military governor. The United States announced plans to build a naval base in the territory to aid in the protection of the Panama Canal.|$|E
5|$|Van Zandt, {{though he}} {{personally}} favored annexation by the <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> authorized to entertain any overtures from the US {{government on the}} subject. Texas officials were at the moment deeply engaged in exploring settlements with Mexican diplomats, facilitated by Great Britain. Texas's predominant concern was not British interference with the institution of slavery – English diplomats had not alluded to the issue – but the avoidance of any resumption of hostilities with Mexico. Still, US Secretary of State Upshur vigorously courted Texas diplomats to begin annexation talks, finally dispatching an appeal to President Sam Houston in January 1844. In it, he assured Houston that, in contrast to previous attempts, the political climate in the United States, including sections of the North, was amenable to Texas statehood, and that a two-thirds majority in Senate could be obtained to ratify a Texas treaty.|$|E
5|$|Seeking a {{union with}} the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a {{referendum}} option, despite the idea having some currency amongst locals. With the Cold War looming, U.S. interest in Newfoundland were centered primarily on its strategic importance to the defence of North America. The Americans' ability to maintain bases on the island satisfied those concerns - after receiving assurances that the Canadian government would honour the leases for bases on Newfoundland, the U.S. State department had no further interest in the political future of Newfoundland. President Harry S. Truman's administration had little incentive to pursue annexation. With respect to foreign policy, such a territorial ambition would have only served to antagonize two key allies. With respect to domestic policy, the administration would not likely {{have been able to}} convince Congress to offer statehood to Newfoundland due to its small population and geographical isolation from the then-48 existing states, and would not likely have been able to convince Newfoundlanders to accept territorial status as an alternative to admission as a U.S. state.|$|E

25|$|On October 19, 1944, Stilwell was {{recalled}} {{from his}} command by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

This was not done and Morgenthau was left without leverage beyond his personal rapport with those in power; when that failed too, he then drew international media attention to the ongoing Armenian Genocide, organized private relief efforts and helped create the American Committee for Armenian and Syrian Relief (ACASR).|$|E

The <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{at the top of}} either measure for cash transfers. Adjusting for income inequality, Ireland had the highest concentration coefficient for income taxes. In 2008, overall income tax rates for the US were below the OECD average.|$|E
25|$|The Rebbe's {{decision}} {{to move to the}} <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a permanent one. Throughout his travails in the Holocaust, he always had in mind the goal of settling in Israel. Toward that end, he established the Kiryat Sanz neighborhood in the beachside city of Netanya in 1958. In so doing, he was the first Rebbe to establish a Haredi neighborhood in an Israeli development town. Over the next few years, he raised money for the establishment of key neighborhood institutions, including girls' and boys' schools and yeshivas, an orphanage, and an old-age home.|$|E

25|$|The <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{particularly}} {{in favor of}} a nuclear Sweden. The cooperation agreement between Sweden and the United States, that established bilateral safeguards for Swedish nuclear installations, forbade Sweden from using equipment and materials to develop nuclear weapons. In the meantime, the use of U.S. uranium would mean accepting inspection requirements, which would prevent the uranium in question from being used for weapons production. The more Sweden’s research in nuclear weapons was becoming dependent on U.S. military assistance, the more the United States was willing to steer Sweden away from implementing its plans to create a nuclear weapon.|$|E
25|$|Prosperity {{returned}} to Canada during the Second World War and {{continued in the}} following years, {{with the development of}} universal health care, old-age pensions, and veterans' pensions. The financial crisis of the Great Depression had led the Dominion of Newfoundland to relinquish responsible government in 1934 and become a crown colony ruled by a British governor. In 1948, the British government gave voters three Newfoundland Referendum choices: remaining a crown colony, returning to Dominion status (that is, independence), or joining Canada. Joining the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> made an option. After bitter debate Newfoundlanders voted to join Canada in 1949 as a province.|$|E

Because a portion of the South's population contained rebels that were unhappy with the abolishment of slavery, that region of the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> well suited for colored people. She goes on to suggest that colored people be given land out west to build homes and prosper on.|$|E
