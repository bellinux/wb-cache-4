The temperature-based momentum-flux profile exhibits positive biases which fluctuate with altitude and have peak values of 17 – 39 % at 20 – 40 km.

For the <b>upward</b> and downward <b>propagating</b> waves their horizontal and vertical wavelength, intrinsic frequency, energy density, pseudo-momentum flux and direction of propagation are determined. The <b>upward</b> <b>propagating</b> wave field is found to be dominated by waves with short vertical wavelength (~ 1 km) and low intrinsic frequency (ω~f).

40|$|The {{interaction}} between buoyancy-driven and diffusion-driven instabilities that can develop along a propagating reaction front is discussed {{for a system}} based on an autocatalytic reaction. Twelve different cases are possible {{depending on whether the}} front is ascending or descending in the gravity field, whether the reactant is heavier or lighter than the products, and whether the reactant diffuses faster, slower, or {{at the same rate as}} the product. A linear stability analysis (LSA) is undertaken, in which dispersion curves (plots of the growth rate sigma against wave number k) are derived for representative cases as well as an asymptotic analysis for small wave numbers. The results from the LSA indicate that, when the initial reactant is denser than the reaction products, <b>upward</b> <b>propagating</b> fronts remain unstable with the diffusion-driven instability enhancing this instability. Buoyantly stable downward propagating fronts become unstable when the system is also diffusionally unstable. When the initial reactant is lighter than the reaction products, any diffusionally unstable <b>upward</b> <b>propagating</b> front is stabilized by small buoyancy effects.

The effect of the PRE on the hF diminishes towards later hours approaching midnight with almost no effect into the post midnight hours. In this context, it was shown by Abdu and Brum (2009) that while the PW oscillation in the PRE vertical drift was present also in the hF values of the post sunset hours, it was totally absent in the hF values of the post midnight hours, over the same station, Fortaleza. Thus, the observation of the PW/UFK wave oscillations in the F layer height during post sunset-pre midnight hours reported in the literature (for example, Takahashi et al. 2007, 2009; Fagundes et al. 2009) are indeed indicative of the manifestations of the PRE modulation by the <b>upward</b> <b>propagating</b> waves.

Although pulsation spectra are well understood for solar-like oscillators, a substantial fraction of red giant stars observed by Kepler exhibit abnormally low-amplitude dipole oscillation modes. Fuller et al. (2015) suggests {{this effect is}} produced by strong core magnetic fields that scatter dipole internal gravity waves (IGWs) into higher multipole IGWs or magnetic waves. In this paper, we study the interaction of IGWs with a magnetic field to test this mechanism. We consider two background stellar structures: one with a uniform magnetic field, and another with a magnetic field that varies both horizontally and vertically. We derive analytic solutions to the wave propagation problem and validate them with numerical simulations. In both cases, we find perfect conversion from IGWs into magnetic waves when the IGWs propagate into a region exceeding a critical magnetic field strength. Downward propagating IGWs cannot reflect into <b>upward</b> <b>propagating</b> IGWs because their vertical wavenumber never approaches zero. Instead, they are converted into <b>upward</b> <b>propagating</b> slow (Alfvenic) waves, and we show they will likely dissipate as they propagate back into weakly magnetized regions.

This interference makes the modal resonance between the ground surface and the lower thermosphere at frequencies of 3 – 5 mHz (Tahira, 1995).

Our methodology consists of measuring the differential response of the thermosphere-ionosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model (TIE-GCM) under solar minimum and solar maximum conditions to constant tidal forcing at its 97 ækm lower boundary, as specified by the observationally based Climatological Tidal Model of the Thermosphere. Diagnosis of the model reveals that these changes are mainly driven by 5. 3 æ_m nitric oxide (NO) cooling, which more efficiently cools the thermosphere at solar maximum. The main role of the tides is to modify the mean molecular oxygen densities ([O 2]) through tidal-induced advective transport, which then lead to changes in NO densities through oxygen-nitrogen chemistry. Through tidal-induced changes in temperature and O, O 2, and N 2 densities, effects on the ionosphere are also quite substantial; tidal-induced modifications to zonal-mean F region peak electron densities (NmF 2) are of order _ 10 % at solar maximum and _ 30 % at solar minimum in the equatorial region. Our results introduce an additional consideration when attributing long-term changes in thermospheric temperature and electron densities to CO 2 cooling effects alone; that is, dissipation of <b>upward</b> <b>propagating</b> tides may constitute an additional element of global change in the ionosphere-thermosphere (IT) system. © 2016.

40|$|Acoustic {{waves are}} {{generated}} by the convective motions in the solar convection zone. When propagating upwards into the chromosphere they reach the height where the sound speed equals the Alfvén speed and they undergo mode conversion, refraction and reflection. We use numerical simulations to study these processes in realistic configurations where the wavelength of the waves {{is similar to the}} length scales of the magnetic field. Even though this regime is outside the validity of previous analytic studies or studies using ray-tracing theory, we show that some of their basic results remain valid: the critical quantity for mode conversion is the angle between the magnetic field and the k-vector: the attack angle. At angles smaller than 308 much of the acoustic, fast mode from the photosphere is transmitted as an acoustic, slow mode propagating along the field lines. At larger angles, most of the energy is refracted/reflected and returns as a fast mode creating an interference pattern between the <b>upward</b> and downward <b>propagating</b> waves. In three-dimensions, this interference between waves at small angles creates patterns with large horizontal phase speeds, especially close to magnetic field concentrations. When damping from shock dissipation and radiation is taken into account, the waves in the low–mid chromosphere have mostly the character of <b>upward</b> <b>propagating</b> acoustic waves and it is only close to the reflecting layer we get similar amplitudes for the <b>upward</b> <b>propagating</b> and refracted/reflected waves. The oscillatory power is suppressed in magnetic field concentrations and enhanced in ring-formed patterns around them.

By means of a multi-layer intensity sampling, velocity comparisons, wavelet power analysis and sectorial studies of time-slices, we retrieve the power distribution, characteristic periodicities and propagation characteristics of sunspot waves at photospheric and chromospheric levels. Signatures of RPWs are found at photospheric layers. Those continuous oscillations occur preferably at periods between 4 - 6 min starting at the inner penumbral boundary. The photospheric oscillations all have a slightly delayed, more defined chromospheric counterpart with larger relative velocities (which are linked to preceding UF events). In all layers the power of RPWs follows a filamentary fine-structure and shows a typical ring-shaped power distribution increasing in radius for larger wave periods. The analysis of time-slices reveals apparent horizontal velocities for RPWs at photospheric layers of ≈ 50 km/s which decrease to ≈ 30 km/s at chromospheric heights. The observations strongly support the scenario of RPWs being <b>upward</b> <b>propagating</b> slow-mode waves guided by the magnetic field lines. Comment: 6 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
