5|$|By the 17th century, {{coastal erosion}} had <b>undermined</b> <b>the</b> castle's walls. In 1627, Charles I {{announced}} that he would repair the fortification but instead the ruins were dismantled in 1631 by Sir John Oglander. A new fortification, Sandown Fort was built in its place, positioned further inland, but the possible remains of the foundations of the original castle are still visible along the shore at low tide.|$|E
5|$|The use of lethal {{force on}} the Berlin Wall was an {{integral}} part of the East German state's policy towards its border system. Nonetheless, the East German government was well aware that border killings had undesirable consequences. The West German, US, British and French authorities protested killings when they occurred and the international reputation of East Germany was damaged as a result.

Though they had never enjoyed an easy relationship, Douglas-Home recognised his colleague's stature, and felt his loss politically as well as personally.

5|$|A {{parliamentary}} {{inquiry and}} media reports {{indicated that the}} Indigenous traditional owners of Muckaty Station were divided over whether it should host a radioactive waste facility. Some members of the Ngapa clan supported hosting the facility, while other traditional owners of Muckaty opposed it. There were also claims that {{some members of the}} Ngapa clan were among those who had signed a petition opposing the facility. Political scientist Rebecca Stringer criticised the federal government's approach to the siting of the waste facility, arguing that it <b>undermined</b> <b>the</b> Indigenous owners' sovereignty and control of their own lands. Environmental organisations and the Australian Greens are opposed to using the site for a dump.|$|E
5|$|Another {{result of}} the coup was that the work {{that had been done}} by British {{intelligence}} with the anti-Axis government of Cvetković and Maček was lost. By supporting the coup plotters, the SOE <b>undermined</b> <b>the</b> balance in Yugoslav politics that had been achieved by the Cvetković–Maček Agreement. Serb nationalists supported and welcomed the coup because it ended Croatian autonomy under the Agreement and freed them to pursue a Greater Serbia agenda. The coup and its immediate aftermath also contributed to the paralysis within the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{during the rest of the}} war, due to ongoing disputes regarding the legitimacy of the Cvetković–Maček Agreement.|$|E

Vick's finances suffered, however, from poor management, bad investments and lawsuits. Certified Financial Planner Michael Smith advised Vick from 2003-2005, but resigned after Vick took bad advice from friends, made ill-conceived investments, overspent, and otherwise <b>undermined</b> <b>the</b> wealth-building plan that Smith had created.

5|$|At {{the time}} the Commercial Import Program (CIP) {{appeared}} to be working successfully and North Vietnam had not decided to attack the South after Diệm had canceled the planned 1956 reunification elections. The glowing press coverage of the period contrasted {{to that of the}} later decades of the 1960s and 1970s, in which the American media engaged in investigative journalism that <b>undermined</b> <b>the</b> official line presented by Washington in relation to Vietnam. This was particularly true during Diệm's downfall in 1963. Journalists such as David Halberstam, Malcolm Browne and Neil Sheehan all won Pulitzer Prizes for their work on the Buddhist crisis, in which mass protests erupted after years of discrimination against the Buddhist majority.|$|E
5|$|Bamber first sought {{leave to}} appeal in November 1986, arguing that the judge had {{misdirected}} the jury. The application was heard and refused by a single judge in April 1988. Bamber's lawyer requested a full hearing before three judges, arguing that the trial judge's summing up had been biased against Bamber, that his language had been too forceful, {{and that he had}} <b>undermined</b> <b>the</b> defence by advancing his own theory. The lawyer also argued that the defence had not pressed Julie Mugford about her dealings with the media, but should have, because as soon as the trial was over her story began to appear in newspapers. The judges rejected the application in March 1989.|$|E

The attempts of Otto to conciliate Greek sentiment through efforts to enlarge the frontiers of his kingdom, for example, by the suggested acquisition of Crete in 1841, failed in their objective, and only succeeded in embroiling him in conflict with the Great Powers.|$|E
5|$|Estate house design {{declined}} in {{importance in the}} twentieth century. An exception was the work undertaken by John Kinross (1855–1955). Beginning with the reconstruction of Thurston House, Dunbar, from 1890, he undertook a series of major country house designs. The most important was Manderston House (1901–03), built for James Miller in the Adam style. Skibo Castle was rebuilt for industrialist Andrew Carnegie (1899–1903) by Ross and Macbeth. English architect C. H. B. Quennell designed a neo-Georgian mansion at Altmore (1912–14) for {{the owner of a}} Moscow department store. There was a lull in building after the First World War and social change <b>undermined</b> <b>the</b> construction of rural country houses.|$|E

5|$|The {{judge said}} there were three crucial points, in no {{particular}} order. Did the jury believe Julie Mugford or Jeremy Bamber? Were they sure that Sheila was not the killer who then committed suicide? He said this question involved another: was the second, fatal, shot fired at Sheila with the silencer on? If yes, {{she could not have}} fired it. Finally, did Nevill call Bamber {{in the middle of the}} night? If there was no such call, it <b>undermined</b> <b>the</b> entirety of Bamber's story; the only reason he would have had to invent the phone call was that he was responsible for the murders.|$|E
5|$|The third letter openly {{incorporates}} Swift's {{argument that}} political authority {{stems from the}} consent of a population. As such, the third letter {{has been seen as}} a response in part to the Declaratory Act, which had <b>undermined</b> <b>the</b> independence and the authority of Irish legislature and judiciary in favour of the British. The Declaratory Act removed the ability for any in Ireland to speak for the people of Ireland, and it was necessary for the act to be removed before the people could be heard.|$|E
5|$|Until about 1962, Khrushchev's {{position}} as Party leader was secure; {{but as the}} leader aged, he grew more erratic and his performance <b>undermined</b> <b>the</b> confidence of his fellow leaders. The Soviet Union's mounting economic problems also increased the pressure on Khrushchev's leadership. Outwardly, Brezhnev remained loyal to Khrushchev, but became involved in a 1963 plot to remove the leader from power, possibly playing a leading role. Also in 1963, Brezhnev succeeded Frol Kozlov, another Khrushchev protégé, as Secretary of the Central Committee, positioning him as Khrushchev's likely successor. Khrushchev made him Second Secretary, literally deputy party leader, in 1964.|$|E

5|$|After this, the Spartans {{sent out}} a new commander, Anaxibius, to Abydos. For a time, he enjoyed a number of successes against Pharnabazus, and seized a number of Athenian {{merchant}} ships. Worried that Thrasybulus's accomplishments were being <b>undermined,</b> <b>the</b> Athenians sent Iphicrates to the region to confront Anaxibius. For a time, the two forces merely raided each other's territory, but eventually Iphicrates succeeded in guessing where Anaxibius would bring his troops on a return march from a campaign against Antandrus, and ambushed the Spartan force. When Anaxibius and his men, who were strung out {{in the line of}} march, had entered the rough, mountainous terrain in which Iphicrates and his men were waiting, the Athenians emerged and ambushed them, killing Anaxibius and many others.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it gained}} recruits, the rising began {{to suffer from}} {{internal}} divisions, particularly between the Highlanders who made {{up the bulk of}} the forces and the Lowland nobles and officers who were their commanders. In early 1654, nine months into the revolt, Middleton, a Lowland officer and a veteran of the Battle of Worcester, arrived with a commission to command from Charles II. Despite objections from his followers, Glencairn surrendered control over his forces, which had now reached 3,500 foot and 1,500 horse. That evening Sir George Munro, Middleton's aide insulted Glencairn's forces and the result was a duel in which Munro was wounded. Glencairn was arrested. He would eventually be released and retire from the conflict. A series of other disputes and duels <b>undermined</b> <b>the</b> leadership of the campaign {{for the remainder of the}} rising.|$|E
5|$|As landholders and drafted {{government}} officials, the gentry {{considered themselves}} the leading members of society; gaining their cooperation and employment was {{essential for the}} county or provincial bureaucrat overburdened with official duties. In many ways, scholar-officials of the Song period differed from the more aristocratic scholar-officials of the Tang dynasty (618–907). Civil service examinations became the primary means of appointment to an official post as competitors vying for official degrees dramatically increased. Frequent disagreements amongst ministers of state on ideological and policy issues led to political strife {{and the rise of}} political factions. This <b>undermined</b> <b>the</b> marriage strategies of the professional elite, which broke apart as a social group and gave way to a multitude of families which provided sons for civil service.|$|E
