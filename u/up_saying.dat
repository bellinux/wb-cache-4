25|$|Ling Tong was {{reputed to}} have a strong sense of righteousness. During the battle at Nan Commandery, Zhou Yu ordered Gan Ning to attack Yiling (夷陵; around present-day Yichang, Hubei). Cao Ren sent an army to attack Gan Ning and had him surrounded. Gan Ning hurriedly {{requested}} for reinforcements, but the generals did not have enough men to spare to save him and believed it was not sagacious to send reinforcements because that would dilute the main army. Lü Meng spoke <b>up,</b> <b>saying</b> that they should help Gan Ning. He proposed to Zhou Yu that Ling Tong stay behind to keep Cao Ren in check {{while the rest of the}} generals go to reinforce Gan Ning. Lü Meng boldly asserted that he had confidence that Ling Tong could hold on for ten days. Ling Tong then took up his duties with responsibility. He countered Cao Ren's attacks alone, and bought time for the other generals to rescue Gan Ning.|$|E

In his review for The Sentinel, Chris Blackhurst {{brought along a}} seven-year-old child called Dylan Brayford, and his 34-year-old godfather, James Humphreys, from Nantwich to watch the musical. The two [...] "weren't disappointed." [...] Blackhurst said [...] "The fast-paced tale of courage and dreams kept both entertained with plenty of hilarious moments {{for the children and}} a sprinkle of gags which flew over younger fans' heads but brought a wry smile to mums and dads' faces."

Subsequently, Russian music manager Ivan Shapovalov held a casting {{call for a}} solo singer to be managed by him, and selected Katina out of several other girls. He and his ex-wife, Elena Kiper, then decided to create and manage a duo, and selected Volkova as the second member for the group.

I rang Alan <b>up,</b> <b>saying</b> I’d like to be involved with what he was doing." [...] and Moore sent him the story outline. Gibbons told Giordano he wanted to draw the series Moore proposed and Moore approved. Gibbons brought colorist John Higgins onto the project because he liked his [...] "unusual" [...] style; Higgins lived near the artist, which allowed the two to [...] "discuss [...] and have some kind of human contact rather than just sending it across the ocean". Len Wein joined the project as its editor, while Giordano stayed on to oversee it.

Shanina was appointed a commander of that platoon. Three days later, southeast of Vitebsk, Shanina killed her first German soldier. In Shanina's own words, recorded by an anonymous author, her legs gave way after that first encounter and she slid down into the trench, saying, [...] "I've killed a man." [...] Concerned, the other women ran <b>up</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "That was a fascist you finished off!" [...] Seven months later, Shanina wrote in her diary that she was now killing the enemy in cold blood and saw the meaning {{of her life in}} her actions.

During one of Como's early Decca recording sessions with the Weems orchestra, Weems {{was told to}} get rid of [...] "that kid" [...] (Como) because he sounded too much like Bing Crosby, who also recorded for Decca. Before Como could reply, Ted Weems spoke <b>up,</b> <b>saying</b> that Como was part of the session or it was over. By the time Como had been with Ted Weems about a year, he was mentioned in a 1937 Life magazine NBC Radio ad for Fibber McGee and Molly as [...] "causing cardiac flutters with his crooning." [...] The weekly radio show, Beat the Band, which ran on NBC from 1940 – 1944, was a [...] "stump the band" [...] type musical quiz show where Weems and his orchestra were the featured band from 1940 – 1941.|$|E

500|$|James Hunt for Den of Geek {{said that}} the episode was {{not as bad as}} [...] "", but that it {{contained}} [...] "almost every terrible cliché seen in TNG first season in one episode". He summed it <b>up,</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "We've seen all of this before, and it was barely interesting the first time around. The second time, it's just tedious. A horrible episode on so many levels." [...] Zack Handlen watched the episode for The A.V. Club and said that he [...] "expected more from TNG", saying that he was not sure what the reversal of gender roles in the episode was meant to achieve. He described the virus subplot as [...] "absurd" [...] and gave the episode an F grade. The episode was included in a couple of worst episode lists, including in one compiled by Scott Thrill for Wired magazine, and it was ranked the fourth worst episode by Jay Garmon at the website TechRepublic.|$|E
500|$|Mason said {{he hoped}} that his storyline would [...] "draw in viewers in a {{responsible}} way" [...] and the feedback would stay positive. Mason added {{that he would like}} to see Chris happy in the future and hopes the viewers will warm to him. He added [...] "I know it's quite a sensitive topic, but I think the difference between his and the last encounters they've had is that we're looking more in-depth into more than just a [...] "gay kiss". We go more into the relationships, how it affects people around". Steele backed this <b>up,</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "We wanted gay to be part of Chris's character, not Chris to be the gay character. He's not your typical gay stereotype that some TV shows like to play up. He's on the basketball team, he's had a girlfriend for a time, and I think the show does a good job of portraying the way his character is discovering who he really is".|$|E
500|$|Michelle Erica Green {{watched the}} episode for TrekNation in May 2009. She also {{thought that it}} was a {{pleasant}} episode but that it [...] "never approaches greatness". She felt that D'Sora never achieved the intimacy that Ishara Yar did with Data, and that the subplot was simply something created so that Picard had something to do. She summed up the ending of the episode by saying that [...] "I don't believe that Data can't be hurt emotionally, but he's more invested in his cat than he ever seems to be in Jenna D'Sora." [...] Keith DeCandido reviewed the episode for Tor.com in May 2012, describing it as a [...] "clunker" [...] and a re-hash of the earlier episode [...] "" [...] but [...] "without the gravitas". He thought that having Picard pilot the shuttle was ridiculous, especially as the character admitted in the episode [...] "11001001" [...] that {{it had been years since}} he had worked the helm of a ship. He summed it <b>up</b> <b>saying</b> that, [...] "ultimately, it's a rehash of a Wesley Crusher episode. A really really bad Wesley Crusher episode" [...] and gave it a score of two out of ten.|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Keith DeCandido {{reviewed}} it on behalf of Tor.com, comparing it to [...] "The Naked Time" [...] and stating that [...] "there's nothing in this episode as entertaining as Sulu bare-chested with an epee, and Wesley being nerdy in the engine room is nowhere near as much fun as Riley singing." [...] He gave the episode a score of two out of ten, remarking that [...] "it's rarely a good idea to do an episode where everyone acts out of character as only the second one out of the gate, since we don't know enough about these people for their acting strange to be meaningful." [...] Cast member Wil Wheaton re-watched the episode for AOL TV, and summed it <b>up</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "whether it was the worst episode ever or not probably rested upon the viewer's expectations.

500|$|Since its broadcast, [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] {{garnered}} {{little to}} no scrutiny from viewers. Vitti has never gotten any questions about the episode, except from his sister-in-law who wanted him to explain the episode for his nephews. [...] " [...] My sister-in-law called me <b>up</b> <b>saying</b> that I {{needed to talk to}} my nephews about how this was wrong that Homer did", Vitti said. [...] "They watched it and had lots of questions for her. And she referred them all to me. So {{there are some people who}} are still bothered by it." [...] The little amount of scrutiny that the episode attracted took The Simpsons staff by surprise, as they anticipated that the episode would generate a lot of controversy. Instead, [...] "Blame It on Lisa", an episode which aired the previous week, caused an uproar in Brazil because of its depiction of the country. It became one of the biggest controversies the series has ever faced. [...] "It just goes to show that you never know what's going to be a problem", Jean said in the DVD commentary for [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's".|$|E

By sixth grade, Michelle joined a gifted class at Bryn Mawr Elementary School (later renamed Bouchet Academy). She attended Whitney Young High School, Chicago's first magnet high school, established as a selective enrollment school, where she was a classmate of Jesse Jackson's daughter Santita. The round-trip commute from the Robinsons' South Side home to the Near West Side, where the school was located, took three hours. She recalled being fearful of how others would perceive her, but disregarded any negativity around her and used it [...] "to fuel me, to keep me going." [...] She recalled experiencing gender discrimination growing <b>up,</b> <b>saying,</b> for example, that rather than asking her for her opinion on a given subject, people commonly tended to ask what her older brother thought.
