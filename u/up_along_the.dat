5|$|After Paradise Interchange, the busway passes under Darley Road, {{then over}} the Torrens {{for the last}} time. The terrain becomes steeper as the busway {{proceeds}} <b>up</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> outflow creek and past the northwestern side of the Hope Valley Reservoir. It proceeds north under Grand Junction Road, then swings east and north again to enter {{the eastern side of}} the Tea Tree Plaza shopping centre precinct, where the guided busway ends at Tea Tree Plaza Interchange. Most buses continue on normal roads to service suburbs further afield.|$|E
5|$|Another {{attempt to}} revive the RDF 1.5 concept, today known more {{generally}} as bistatic radar, was made in March 1940 when a modified set was mounted in Bristol Blenheim L6622. This set was tuned to the transmissions of the new Chain Home Low transmitters, dozens of which were being set <b>up</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> UK coastline. These experiments did not prove successful, with a detection range {{on the order of}} , and the concept was abandoned for good.|$|E

5|$|Compressive forces built <b>up</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> {{entire length}} of the broad {{continental}} shelf. The Sierran Arc, also called the Cordilleran Mesozoic magmatic arc, started to form from heat and pressure generated from the subduction. Compressive forces caused thrust faults to develop and granitic blobs of magma called plutons to rise in the Death Valley region and beyond, most notably creating the Sierra Nevada Batholith to the west. Thrust faulting was so severe that the continental shelf was shortened and some parts of older formations were moved on top of younger rock units.|$|E
5|$|Sea salt was {{extracted}} {{during the}} Roman period, {{and a string}} of settlements were set <b>up</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Polden Hills. Some possible settlement sites are also known in the Draycott and Cheddar Moors and around Highbridge. The discovery at Shapwick of 9,238silver Roman coins, the second largest hoard ever found from the Roman Empire included coins dated from as early as 31–30 BC up until 224 AD. The hoard also contained two rare coins which had not been discovered in Britain before, and the largest number of silver denarii ever found in Britain.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 19thcentury, the European American {{newcomers}} had begun to remove vegetation, build sawmills, fell trees, fill wetlands, and farm in the fertile soil along Johnson Creek. The creek is named for one of these newcomers, William Johnson, who in 1846 settled in what later became the Lents neighborhood of Portland and operated a water-powered sawmill. In early 1848 Lot Whitcomb, who would later found Milwaukie, filed a donation land claim and built a sawmill near the confluence of Johnson Creek and the Willamette River. In 1886, plans were made for train tracks along the creek. In 1903, the Springwater Division Line, also known as the Portland Traction Company Line, the Cazadero Line, and the Bellrose Line, was built along Johnson Creek to provide rail transport for passengers and freight. Sellwood, Eastmoreland, Lents, and Pleasant Valley were among the new communities that grew <b>up</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> line. By the 1920s, housing began to replace creekside farms.|$|E

Once in town, Darrin is informed that he will only receive the money if he successfully leads a local gospel group to victory at an upcoming competition. Reluctant but strapped for cash, Darrin takes on the task of finding the best singers in town and shaping the group <b>up.</b> <b>Along</b> <b>the</b> way, he becomes acclimated to the town {{with the help of his}} cousin Lucius (played by Mike Epps) and meets Lilly, a single mother who not only possesses an incredible voice but also the ability to warm Darrin's cold heart.|$|E
5|$|Fed by {{intelligence}} {{from the}} Soviet Union, the North Koreans were aware the UN forces were building <b>up</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Pusan Perimeter {{and that they}} had to conduct an offensive soon or else forfeit the battle. In planning its new offensive, the North Korean commanders decided that any attempt to flank the UN force was impossible thanks to the support of the UN navy. Instead, they opted to use frontal attacks to breach the perimeter and collapse it. A secondary objective was to surround Taegu and destroy the UN and ROK units in that city. As part of this mission, the North Korean units would first cut the supply lines to Taegu.|$|E
5|$|French {{casualties}} {{are harder}} to calculate but were significantly higher. Estimates of French losses range from 2,000 to 5,000, with a suggested median point of 3,500, which includes more than 1,000 captured wounded and nearly 2,000 killed, half of whom died on Orient. In addition to Admiral Brueys killed and Admiral Blanquet wounded, four captains died and seven others were seriously wounded. The French ships suffered severe damage: Two ships {{of the line and}} two frigates were destroyed (as well as a bomb vessel scuttled by its crew), and three other captured ships were too battered ever to sail again. Of the remaining prizes, only three were ever sufficiently repaired for frontline service. For weeks after the battle, bodies washed <b>up</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Egyptian coast, decaying slowly in the intense, dry heat.|$|E

5|$|Having {{crossed into}} Europe in April 480 BC, the Persian army began its march to Greece. Five major food depots {{had been set}} <b>up</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> path: at White Headland on the Thracian side of the Hellespont, at Tyrodiza in Perinthian territory, at Doriskos at the Evros river estuary where the Asian army was linked up with the Balkan allies, at Eion on the Strymon river, and at Therme, modern-day Thessaloniki. There, food had been sent from Asia for several years in {{preparation}} for the campaign. Animals had been bought and fattened, while the local populations had, for several months, been ordered to grind the grains into flour. The Persian army took roughly three months to travel unopposed from the Hellespont to Therme, a journey of about 600km (360 mi). It paused at Doriskos where it was joined by the fleet. Xerxes reorganized the troops into tactical units replacing the national formations used earlier for the march.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Oslo Sporveier {{presented}} plans {{involving a}} rapid transit circle line in Oslo, connecting the newly built hospital Rikshospitalet {{with the rest}} of the city. A detailed suggestion was presented by Oslo Sporveier in August 1996. In the local newspaper Aftenposten Aften there was a debate on whether there should be a ring line from Berg along the National Road 150 towards Gaustad over Rikshospitalet, or whether the Ullevål Hageby Line should be extended from John Colletts plass to Rikshospitalet, thereby creating a correspondence with the Sognsvann Line at the new station Forskningsparken. In the first plans, Berg was meant to be a station on the new ring line. This plan was discarded since local residents feared noise pollution and destroyed lawns. Even though Berg was not made a station on the Ring Line, noise shields were put <b>up</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Sognsvann Line.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the UN advances, China's Chairman, Mao Zedong, ordered the People's Liberation Army's North East Frontier Force to enter North Korea and engage UN forces under the name People's Volunteer Army (PVA). In order to stabilize the rapidly collapsing Korean front and to push back the advancing UN forces, Mao authorized the First Phase Campaign, a bridgehead-building operation {{with the aim of}} destroying the ROK II Corps, the vanguard and the right flank of the US Eighth Army, advancing <b>up</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Taebaek Mountains {{in the middle of the}} peninsula. After the Chinese leadership finally settled the issue of armed intervention on October 18, Mao ordered the PVA to enter Korea on October 19 under strict secrecy.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Caxias had {{organized}} {{an assault on}} the new Paraguayan defenses which López had thrown <b>up</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Pikysyry, south of Asunción (Paraguay's capital). This stream afforded a strong defensive position which was anchored by the Paraguay River and by the swampy jungle of the Chaco region. Caxias had a road cut through the supposedly impenetrable Chaco, located {{on the other side of}} the Paraguayan River where the Allied army was camped. The Brazilian ships carried the Allied troops across the river, where they moved over the road which had been finished in December. The Allied forces outflanked the Paraguayan lines and attacked from the rear. The combined allied forces annihilated the Paraguayan army and on 1 January 1869 Asunción was occupied.|$|E
5|$|Mining was {{challenging}} as the ore {{was distributed}} in an uneven manner and digging was made slow by permafrost. As a result, some miners chose {{to buy and}} sell claims, building up huge investments and letting others do the work. To accommodate the prospectors, boom towns sprang <b>up</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> routes and at their end Dawson City was founded at the confluence of the Klondike and the Yukon River. From a population of 500 in 1896, the town grew to house around 30,000 people by summer 1898. Built of wood, isolated and unsanitary, Dawson suffered from fires, high prices, and epidemics. Despite this, the wealthiest prospectors spent extravagantly gambling and drinking in the saloons. The Native Hän people, on the other hand, suffered from the rush, being moved into a reserve {{to make way for the}} stampeders, and many died.|$|E

5|$|One {{of their}} {{innovative}} features {{was a relatively}} new kind of bow called the bulbous bow or Taylor bow, named after its inventor, Rear Admiral David W. Taylor, who served as Chief Constructor for the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair in World War I. The result {{of a series of}} towing tests begun in 1910, this bow reduced water resistance by an average of six percent at high speeds, supported the forecastle and reduced bending stress on the hull. A disadvantage was the formation of a heavy layer of water which would creep <b>up</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> forward side of the hull at higher speeds, although this could be reduced to some degree by careful design of this area.|$|E
5|$|Preceded by a {{controversial}} bombing raid that destroyed {{much of the}} historic Old City of Caen, Operation Charnwood began at dawn on 8 July, with battalions of three infantry divisions attacking German positions north of Caen, behind a creeping barrage. Supported by three armoured brigades, the British I Corps made gradual progress against the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend and the 16th Luftwaffe Field Division. By {{the end of the}} day the 3rd Canadian Division and the British 3rd Infantry Division and 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division had cleared the villages in their path and reached the outskirts of the city. Moving into Caen at dawn the following morning, the Allies encountered resistance from remnants of German units who were beginning a withdrawal across the Orne. Carpiquet airfield fell to the Canadians during the early morning and by 18:00, the British and Canadians had linked <b>up</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> north bank of the Orne. The remaining bridges were defended or impassable and with German reserves positioned to oppose their crossing, I Corps ended the operation.|$|E

In a surprise attack, the Australians inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese. After the battle the Australians estimated that up to 90 had been killed. Following this the Japanese began to employ infiltration techniques {{in an attempt to}} pass through the numerous listening posts that had been set <b>up</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> side of the track which formed the front of one side of the 2/12th's position. Elsewhere, at the mission, starting at around 8:00pm, they carried out harassment operations in an effort to distract the Australians and assist their comrades to try to break through the Australian positions from the Gama River. This lasted throughout the night.|$|E
