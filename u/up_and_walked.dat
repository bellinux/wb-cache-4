The song {{was performed by}} Geddes {{on the night of}} the contest in a red shirt and suit, as well as with a female pianist, a violinist and cellist, as well as a male and a female backing singer. The song began with Geddes sitting on a stool, leaning against the piano, before he got <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> around the stage.|$|E
500|$|As Hornsby {{recalled}} later, Ruth [...] "didn't say a word. He didn't {{even look}} around or up at me. He just picked himself <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> away". Ruth's {{failed attempt to}} steal second base ended {{the game and the}} 1926 World Series; it is, as of 2016, the only time a World Series has ended with a runner being caught stealing. Ruth explained later that he attempted to steal second base because he thought no one would expect it. He hoped that by getting to second base, he could have an easier chance at scoring if Meusel hit a single into the outfield.|$|E

500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1958, the group had another chance to {{audition}} for Carroll Levis, nearly {{a year and a}} half after the Quarymen's first Star Search. For the audition, the group changed their name to Johnny and the Moondogs. Lennon was without a guitar, his having broken recently. Johnny and the Moondogs passed the first heat of the competition in Liverpool, and were invited to appear in the finals in Manchester. The group performed Buddy Holly's [...] "Think It Over" [...] to positive reception, but were unable to stay until the end of the competition to receive the results. As they were leaving, Lennon saw a cutaway electric guitar by the stage door, picked it <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> off with it, later saying that the trip [...] "wasn't a total loss." ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{production}} of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' 1991 album Blood Sugar Sex Magik, producer Rick Rubin regularly visited singer Anthony Kiedis to review Kiedis' new material. He found a poem titled [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] while flipping through Kiedis' notebook and instantly took an interest in the poignant lyrics. Rubin suggested that Kiedis show it {{to the rest of the}} band: [...] "I thought it was beautiful. I said 'We've got to do this.'" [...] Kiedis was reluctant, as he felt the poem was too emotional and did not fit the Chili Peppers' style. After singing the poem to guitarist John Frusciante and drummer Chad Smith, Kiedis recalls that they [...] "got <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> over to their instruments and started finding the beat and guitar chords to match it". Frusciante chose the chords he played in the introduction to balance out the depressing nature of the lyrics, saying [...] "my brain interpreted it as being a really sad song so I thought if the lyrics are really sad like that I should write some chords that are happier".|$|E
500|$|As of season14, 229 {{candidates}} have competed, {{one of whom}} has competed three times—Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth competed in both season1, season7, and season13. The youngest competitors include Jessie Connors and Chris Shelton, who appeared on the show at age 21. At age 75, Joan Rivers of season8 was the oldest candidate to both appear {{on the show and}} win the competition. There have been six instances in which a candidate left The Apprentice for reasons other than being eliminated by Trump. Overcome by stress, Verna Felton of season3 [...] "just packed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> out". Michelle Sorro of season6 quit after determining that the competition was [...] "too much" [...] and [...] "not worth it". Actor Vincent Pastore of season7 resigned due to a conflict with Piers Morgan. Olympic sprinter Michael Johnson of season9 quit due to a personal family situation. During season11, baseball player Jose Canseco quit due to his father's illness and NeNe Leakes left due to a conflict with Star Jones. The thirteen winners of the show, in chronological order, are Bill Rancic, Kelly Perdew, Kendra Todd, Randal Pinkett, Sean Yazbeck, Stefanie Schaeffer, Piers Morgan, Joan Rivers, Bret Michaels, Brandy Kuentzel, John Rich, Arsenio Hall, Trace Adkins (the first All-Star Celebrity Apprentice), and Leeza Gibbons.|$|E

Jesus also told the man that his sins were forgiven, which irritated the Pharisees. Jesus is {{described}} as responding to the anger by asking whether it is easier to say that someone's sins are forgiven, or to tell the man to get <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walk.</b> Mark <b>and</b> Luke state that Jesus was in a house at the time, and that the man had to be lowered through the roof by his friends due to the crowds blocking the door.|$|R

500|$|On October 18, 2003, [...] "Everytime" [...] was {{performed}} by Britney {{for the very first}} time during the twenty-ninth season of the American comedy show Saturday Night Live. She also performed it at Britney Spears: In the Zone, a concert special that aired in ABC on November 17, 2003. [...] "Everytime" [...] was also performed by Spears at 2004's The Onyx Hotel Tour. Before the tour began, Spears said that it was one of the songs she was looking most forward to perform, explaining, [...] "I really think I'm talking to everyone when I perform 'Everytime'". It was the first song of the third act, titled [...] "Mystic Garden". It began with a video interlude in which Spears walked into a garden wearing a rainbow-colored dress and sat in a flower-covered piano. As the video ended, it was revealed that she was sitting onstage in a similar setting. She started the performance talking to the audience about the media coverage of her personal life. She played the piano and sang until the second verse, where she stood <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> to the center of the stage to continue the performance. Neil Strauss of The New York Times commented, [...] "It was the only song that she appeared to sing unaccompanied by backing tapes". Kelefa Sanneh of Blender called it the best performance of the show.|$|E
500|$|Fearnet critic Alyse Wax wrote [...] "This episode made {{my brain}} hurt. [...] And I {{mean that in}} the nicest way possible. They were {{throwing}} a lot of weird shit at us. It was great because I feel like we are finally getting answers, like we will finally get some closure, and just maybe {{get rid of the}} Red universe stiffs. This episode was so ridiculously dense I am sure I missed some of the deeper scientific facts. I got the gist of it, though, and frankly, I much prefer these jam-packed episodes. I like when the puzzle pieces start falling into place. It's calming." [...] SFScope's Sarah Stegall believed the episode [...] "start out interestingly enough", but unlike other reviewers, she was very critical of the First People mythology, stating [...] "This is where my disbelief not only stopped being suspended, it got <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> out of the room... I still don't like the premise of the evolution of an entire hominid species that left not one single solitary fossil behind. It's more like fantasy than science fiction." [...] Stegall praised Torv's acting as she plays [...] "two people very subtly, very convincingly", and concluded her review by commenting she will continue to watch the series because she trusts the writers will [...] "supply us with plausible answers from time to time", but is [...] "losing some respect for it".|$|E
500|$|Hopkins was {{generally}} expected to reprise his Academy Award-winning role. Hopkins did say in June 1999 {{that he would}} only be interested if the script was [...] "really good". Hopkins says on the making-of feature on DVD that he couldn’t {{make up his mind}} to commit. [...] "I was kind of surprised by this book, Hannibal. I thought it was really overreaching and so bizarre. So I couldn’t make up my mind about it all. Some of it I found intriguing, some I was a little doubtful about." [...] When the producers confirmed {{that they were going to}} film Harris' novel, Hopkins told them yes, but added: [...] "It needs some condensing." [...] The Hollywood Reporter would confirm that Hopkins had agreed to reprise his role in late December 1999, saying he had approved the latest [...] of the script by Steven Zaillian. Hopkins said he had no difficulty moving back into [...] "Lecter's mind". [...] "I just learned the lines and showed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> around as Hannibal Lecter. I thought, 'Do I repeat that same performance, or do I vary it?' Ten years had passed so I changed a bit." [...] In the book, Lecter uses bandages to disguise himself as a plastic surgery patient. This was left out of the film because Scott and Hopkins agreed to leave the face alone. Hopkins explains why: [...] "It's as if he's making a statement—'catch me if you can'. With his big hat, he's so obvious that nobody thinks he's Hannibal Lecter. I've always thought he's a very elegant man, a Renaissance man." [...] In the film, Lecter is first seen in Florence [...] "as the classical Lecter, lecturing and being smooth", according to Hopkins. When the film moves to the U.S., Hopkins changed his appearance by building up muscle and cropping his hair short [...] "to make him like a mercenary, that he would be so fit and so strong that he could just snap somebody in two if they got... in his way".|$|E

2500|$|By {{this time}} his {{captaincy}} {{was beginning to}} arouse dissent.

After the tour, Stollmeyer, who had been Goddard's vice-captain in India, England, Australia and New Zealand, said that Goddard had received too much credit {{for the success of}} the 1950 tour, and that the other senior players of the side had received too little. His comments led to long-standing animosities and divisions in the West Indian camp.

2500|$|Case 3. This case {{illustrates}} autonomic status epilepticus {{with frequent}} vomiting witnessed from onset. An 8-year-old boy of mixed race had 2 prolonged seizures {{at the age}} of 5 years. The first seizure occurred during a brief nap. He woke <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> with “shaking feet” to his mother, complaining that he felt sick. Within 2 to 3 minutes, his eyes and subsequently his head turned to the extreme right. His mother recalls: “I asked him to look at me, and he would not. If I moved his head to the front, it would go back to the right. Within a minute he vomited, and his eyes started blinking, and there were also tiny jerks of his body, legs, and arms that lasted for a minute. He became unresponsive to anything I said to him. He then was rigid, and he went to a deep sleep like in a coma. In the hospital he continued to be in this unconscious state, ever so often just getting up to be sick, and straight back down again. He did not start to regain consciousness or be aware of people around until about 3 hours later. He was well the next morning and discharged home.” ...|$|E

Their feud began at the pre-fight press conference. After most of the attention from the media was given to Shamrock, Severn got <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> out of the door without explanation. Shamrock took Severn's action as a sign of disrespect. Severn later said that he walked out because he felt that it would be unfair to Shamrock for him to be present in the room while Shamrock was discussing his fight strategy to the media. Shamrock became even more furious when he found a newsletter back at the hotel that explained to readers how Severn was going to destroy Shamrock. During the match, Shamrock forced Severn to tap out to a choke in 2:14 to win the UFC Superfight Championship.|$|E
