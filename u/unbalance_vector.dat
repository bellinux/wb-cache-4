50|$|A {{photocell}} (sometimes {{called a}} phaser), proximity sensor, or encoder {{is used to}} determine the rotational speed, as well as the relative phase of the rotating part. This phase information is then used to filter the vibration information to determine the amount of movement, or force, in one rotation of the part. Also, the time difference between the phase and the vibration peak gives the angle at which the unbalance exists.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of spiral vibration (Newkirk-effect) may {{be observed in}} various types of rotating machinery. It {{is caused by a}} vibration-induced hot spot on the shaft surface, which is generated by friction. Spiral vibration with a forward rotating <b>unbalance</b> <b>vector</b> occurred at a hydrogen-cooled turbogenerator. From tests with the running generator the carbon brushes sliding on the slip rings were identified as the hot spot location. Potential modifications were studied using hot spot stability analyses with a rotor dynamic model of the generator shaft. The applied method, introduced by Schmied, allows the handling of general systems. It uses a hot spot model based on Kellenberger’s thermal equation between the shaft’s thermal deflection and its displacement. In the case of slip rings, the hot spot is caused by friction from the carbon brushes. The stability threshold is determined as a function of rotor speed and the ratio of added to dissipated heat. Three different relations between the added heat and the shaft vibration were modelled: heat input proportional to the shaft displacement, to the shaft velocity and to the shaft acceleration. The model with the heat input proportional to the velocity was found to be the most suitable variant. This was confirmed by comparison with measurements. Finally, a modification was selected based on the calculation results and successfully implemented.

40|$|International audienceControlling the part's {{balance of}} {{crankshafts}} {{is an important}} issue for automobile manufacturers. Unbalance measurement is carried out, in general, with high-precision mechanical balancing machines. Each model of crankshaft requires a specialized mechanical balancing machine. We propose a new solution for balancing crankshafts by replacing mechanical measuring systems with a non-contact digitizing system, which allows the acquisition of a representative 3 D point cloud of the crankshaft surface. The Voxel 2 inertia method is proposed to convert 3 D scanned point clouds into a voxel-based representation and to calculate the inertia matrix and the <b>unbalance</b> <b>vectors.</b> Theoretical CAD models are used to determinate the best setting for mesh and voxelization. Several levels of error are introduced on CAD models in order to estimate the necessary scanning quality, and thus define the appropriate scanning system for balancing measurements. The Voxel 2 inertia algorithm is validated on three different crankshaft models that were scanned with the most appropriate digitizing system. The results highlight that this new approach for determining <b>unbalance</b> <b>vectors</b> from scanned data is suitable for replacing the current mechanical measuring systems. This technology can make the production lines more flexible and more adaptable for future changes...|$|R

40|$|Balancing of {{flexible}} rotor with bow using {{transfer matrix method}} MB Deepthikumar 1, AS Sekhar 2 and MR Srikanthan 1 Synchronous lateral vibration is a frequent cause of machine failure and {{is probably the most}} common source of machine noise and vibration. Among the broad ranges of faults that cause synchronous vibration, mass unbalance and bow are the most common faults present in the rotor and hence their detailed understanding is required. In the present study, a rotor model having both mass unbalance and bow is analyzed to find the influence of these faults on the synchronous response. The synchronous response of a rotor is a function of influence coefficients due to mass unbalance and bow. The influence coefficients are analytically derived using transfer matrix method for rotor bearing system having both mass unbalance and bow. The correction <b>unbalance</b> <b>vector</b> required to balance the rotor at its first bending critical speed is computed using these analytically derived influence coefficients and the rotor responses measured at a speed much lower than the first bending critical speed. The balancing method needs a good mathematical model for the rotor system in finding the influence coefficients for mass unbalance and bow. This procedure helps in estimating the correction mass in a single trial run and using a single balancing plane, thus reducing the cycle time for balancing flexible rotors. Experiments are carried out on a test rig to verify the procedure...|$|E

The balancing head is activated by the command signals generated from a personal computer, so that the estimated modal unbalance is cancelled and rotor vibrations are kept relatively small as the rotor system passes through critical speeds. During operation of the rotor-bearing system, the vibrations measured by proximity probes are sampled inio the computer and analysed to determine the modal unbalance of the rotor. The active control procedures which counterbalance the modal unbalance using the balancing head are described in this paper along with the theoretical background of the control system for the isotropic rotor-bearing system. Laboratory experiments show that the balancing head and computer control system designed is effective in modal balancing and reliable well over thejrst and second critical speeds.

40|$|Identification of {{principal}} contributors to voltage unbalance {{and hence the}} implementation of suitable corrective measures has become an issue of concern for some network providers. In order to comply with stipulated limits, these network service providers require the development of quantitative measures that are reliable. For simple radial networks, the identification of sources {{may be seen as}} a trivial task. However, for interconnected networks which contain untransposed transmission lines and unbalanced loads, the identification of sources of unbalance is a non-trivial task. This paper gives a systematic theoretical approach {{that can be used to}} study the voltage unbalance behaviour exhibited by line and load asymmetries in interconnected network environments. A study network is initially analysed, and the outcomes are employed to develop a new concept termed dasiavoltage unbalance emission vectorpsila to ascertain the overall influence made by an asymmetrical line or a load on voltage unbalance in a global sense. Using the voltage <b>unbalance</b> emission <b>vectors</b> of individual lines and loads, a technique has been developed which enables the identification of dominant contributors to voltage unbalance levels.

40|$|Reduced order {{models are}} {{required}} for controller design purposes to allow practical realization and implementation in real-time applications. In the rotor dynamics field, the con-trollers associated with magnetic bearings are classic examples of such a requirement. A technique is introduced to reduce {{the order of a}} finite element rotor model to one involving only the re-quired rectilinear displacements in sensor and controller nodal planes. The reduced order model is shown to predict a number of natural frequencies and responses to step changes in unbalance with considerable accuracy. A simulation of the rotor making contact with a rigid retainer bearing is also established using a constrained Lagrangian multiplier. Again, the differences be-tween the full and reduced order model rotor orbits are shown to be small. NOMENCLATURE C Damping matrix ∗Address all correspondence to this author. C 11, [...] .

40|$|Rotordynamic {{instability}} can {{be disastrous}} {{for the operation}} of high speed turbomachinery in the industry. Most ??instabilities?? are due to de-stabilizing cross coupled forces from variable fluid dynamic pressure around a rotor component, acting {{in the direction of}} the forward whirl and causing subsynchronous orbiting of the rotor. However, all subsynchronous whirling is not unstable and methods to diagnose the potentially unstable kind are critical to the health of the rotor-bearing system. The objective of this thesis is to explore means of diagnosing whether subsynchronous vibrations are benign or have the potential to become unstable. Several methods will be detailed to draw lines of demarcation between the two. Considerable focus of the research has been on subharmonic vibrations induced from non-linear bearing stiffness and the study of vibration signals typical to such cases. An analytical model of a short-rigid rotor with stiffness non-linearity is used for numerical simulations and the results are verified with actual experiments. Orbits filtered at the subsynchronous frequency are shown as a diagnostic tool to indicate benign vibrations as well as ??frequency tracking?? and agreement of the frequency with known eigenvalues. Several test rigs are utilized to practically demonstrate the above conclusions. A remarkable finding has been the possibility of diagnosing instability using the synchronous phase angle. The synchronous phase angle ?? is the angle by which the <b>unbalance</b> <b>vector</b> leads the vibration vector. Experiments have proved that ?? changes appreciably when there is a de-stabilizing cross coupled force acting on the rotor as compared to when there is none. A special technique to calculate the change in ?? with cross-coupling is outlined along with empirical results to exemplify the case. Subsequently, a correlation between the synchronous phase angle and the phase angle measured with most industrial balancing instruments is derived so that the actual measurement of the true phase angle is not a necessity for diagnosis. Requirements of advanced signal analysis techniques have led to the development of an extremely powerful rotordynamic measurement teststand ?? ??LVTRC??. The software was developed in tandem with this thesis project. It is a stand-alone application that can be used for field measurements and analysis by turbomachinery companies...|$|E
