In preparation, he enrolled in the New England Culinary Institute, graduating in 1997. Brown says that he was a poor science student in high school and college, but he focused on the subject to understand the <b>underlying</b> <b>processes</b> of cooking. He is outspoken in his shows about his dislike of single-purpose kitchen utensils and equipment ("unitaskers"), such as garlic presses and margarita machines, although he adapts a few traditionally single-purpose devices, such as rice cookers and melon ballers, into multi-purpose tools.|$|E
25|$|Within the Cardamone et al. paper, {{comparisons}} {{are made with}} other compact galaxies, namely Blue Compact Dwarfs Galaxies and UV-luminous Galaxies, at local and much higher distances. The findings show that GPs form a different class of galaxies than Ultra Blue Compact Dwarfs, but may {{be similar to the}} most luminous members of the Blue Compact Dwarf Galaxy category. The GPs are also similar to UV-luminous high redshift galaxies such as Lyman-break Galaxies and Lyman-alpha emitter. It is concluded that if the <b>underlying</b> <b>processes</b> occurring in the GPs are similar to that found in the UV-luminous high redshift galaxies, the GPs may be the last remnants of a mode of star formation common in the early Universe.|$|E

25|$|The social {{sharing of}} {{emotions}} {{is a phenomenon}} {{in the field of}} psychology that concerns the tendency to recount and share emotional experiences with others. According to this area of research, emotional experiences are not uniquely fleeting and internal. Scientific studies of catastrophes and important life events demonstrate the propensity of victims to talk about their experiences and express their emotions. At the onset of these empirical studies, Rimé et al. coined the term “social sharing of emotions” in 1991 to name the observed phenomenon. This research was a significant development in social psychology because it questioned the accepted view of emotions—that emotions are short-lived and intrapersonal episodes—that was prevalent in the literature. Yet, the first set of experiments revealed that 88–96% of emotional experiences are shared and discussed to some degree. Therefore, the studies concerning the social sharing of emotions contribute a substantial new perspective to the understanding of emotions and their <b>underlying</b> <b>processes.</b>|$|E

Such event data are {{the starting point for}} process mining – an emerging scienti¿c discipline relating modeled and observed behavior. Whereas an event log describes example behavior of the <b>underlying</b> <b>process,</b> a process model aims to describe an abstraction of the same process. Models may be descriptive or normative. Descriptive models aim to describe the <b>underlying</b> <b>process</b> and are used for discussion, performance analysis, obtaining insights, and prediction. Normative models describe the desired behavior and are used for work¿ow management, system con¿guration, auditing, compliance management, and conformance checking.

40|$|A {{generalized}} {{bridge is}} the law of a stochastic process that is conditioned on N linear functionals of its path. We consider two types of representations of such bridges: orthogonal and canonical. The orthogonal representation is constructed from the entire path of the <b>underlying</b> <b>process.</b> Thus, future knowledge of the path is needed. The orthogonal representation is provided for any continuous Gaussian process. In the canonical representation the filtrations and the linear spaces generated by the bridge <b>process</b> and the <b>underlying</b> <b>process</b> coincide. Thus, no future information of the <b>underlying</b> <b>process</b> is needed. Also, in the semimartingale case the canonical bridge representation {{is related to the}} enlargement of filtration and semimartingale decompositions. The canonical representation is provided for the so-called prediction-invertible Gaussian processes. All martingales are trivially prediction-invertible. A typical non-semimartingale example of a prediction-invertible Gaussian process is the fractional Brownian motion. We apply the canonical bridges to insider trading...|$|R

2500|$|While the SA {{construct}} {{has been}} widely researched, the multivariate nature of SA poses a considerable challenge to its quantification and measurement (for a detailed discussion on SA measurement, see Endsley & Garland, 2000; Fracker, 1991a; 1991b). In general, techniques vary in terms of direct measurement of SA (e.g., objective real-time probes or subjective questionnaires assessing perceived SA) or methods that infer SA based on operator behavior or performance. Direct measures are typically considered to be [...] "product-oriented" [...] in that these techniques assess an SA outcome; inferred measures {{are considered to be}} [...] "process-oriented," [...] focusing on the <b>underlying</b> <b>processes</b> or mechanisms required to achieve SA (Graham & Matthews, 2000).

Speed (often reaction time: time taken to respond to the stimulus) and accuracy (proportion of correct responses) are commonly employed measures of performance in behavioral tasks. [...] Researchers infer that the nature of the <b>underlying</b> <b>process(es)</b> required by the task gives rise to differences; slower rates and lower accuracy on these tasks are taken as measures of increased difficulty. [...] An important component of any behavioral task is that it stays relatively true to 'normal' language comprehension—the ability to generalize the results of any task is restricted when the task has little in common with how people actually encounter language.|$|E

2500|$|Transference-focused {{psychotherapy}} (TFP) {{is a form}} of {{psychoanalytic therapy}} dating to the 1960s, rooted in the conceptions of Otto Kernberg on BPD and its underlying structure (borderline personality organization). Unlike in the case of traditional psychoanalysis, the therapist plays a very active role in TFP. In session the therapist works on the relationship between the patient and the therapist. The main focus is on the patient's emotions concerning their relationship with the therapist and the therapist's use of psychodynamic techniques (e.g., interpretation). The therapist will try to explore and clarify aspects of this relationship so the underlying object relations dyads become clear. Some limited research on TFP suggests it may reduce some symptoms of BPD by affecting certain <b>underlying</b> <b>processes,</b> and that TFP in comparison to dialectical behavioral therapy and supportive therapy results in increased reflective functioning (the ability to realistically think about how others think) and a more secure attachment style. [...] Furthermore, TFP {{has been shown to be}} as effective as DBT in improvement of suicidal behavior, and has been more effective than DBT in alleviating anger and in reducing verbal or direct assaultive behavior. Limited research suggests that TFP appears to be less effective than schema-focused therapy, while being more effective than no treatment.|$|E
