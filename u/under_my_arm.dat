2500|$|From 1928 to 1929, Cartier-Bresson studied art, literature, and English at the University of Cambridge, {{where he}} became bilingual. In 1930, during {{conscription}} in the French Army at Le Bourget near Paris, he remembered, [...] "And I had quite a hard time of it, too, because I was toting Joyce <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> and a Lebel rifle on my shoulder." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Emerson did not own {{a record}} player, he enjoyed {{listening}} to music on the radio, particularly Floyd Cramer's 1961 slip note-style [...] "On the Rebound" [...] {{and the work of}} Dudley Moore. He used jazz sheet music from Dave Brubeck and George Shearing and learned about jazz piano from books. He also listened to boogie-woogie, and to country-style pianists including Joe [...] "Mr Piano" [...] Henderson, Russ Conway and Winifred Atwell. Emerson later described himself: [...] "I was a very serious child. I used to walk around with Beethoven sonatas <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm.</b> However, I was very good at avoiding being beaten up by the bullies. That was because I could also play Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard songs. So, they thought I was kind of cool and left me alone." ...|$|E
60|$|As I was on {{the point}} of {{returning}} indoors with the foils <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm,</b> Andrea called me back.|$|E
6000|$|... "What! {{you know}} better than I do? Which of us is surgeon-optic--you or me? No more of this. Come <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms!</b> Come into the odder rooms!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With Olaf on <b>my</b> back, Snorro <b>under</b> <b>my</b> left <b>arm,</b> and {{the right}} arm free to swing--I think not," [...] replied Hake, quietly but decidedly.|$|R
60|$|It {{was another}} day when I awoke. I felt all right {{except for a}} soreness <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> and across <b>my</b> chest where the lasso had chafed and bruised me. Still I did not recover my good spirits. Herky-Jerky kept on {{grinning}} and cracking jokes on my failure to escape. He had appropriated my revolver for himself, {{and he asked me}} several times if I wanted to borrow it to shoot Greaser.|$|R
60|$|She hurriedly divided my {{savings and}} thrust my share into my lap. I pushed it in <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Take it, sir. Strap it boldly round your waist. If anyone {{remarks on}} it, laugh, {{and say it}} was a Huguenot's half an hour ago. I will carry mine stuck <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Ho, ho!" [...] cried he {{with a high}} crowing laugh, [...] "it is not {{the head}} upon my {{shoulders}} that I think of. Cospetto! no. It is the head <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> which you have preserved." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's sound philosophy, Bob; {{where did}} you pick it up? I suspect {{you must have been}} {{studying}} Shakespeare of late, on the sly. But come, get behind me, and put your hands <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> and heave; I'll shove with my sound limb. Now let us act together. Stay! Bob, we've been long enough aboard ship to know the value of a song in producing unity of action. Take the tune from me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is time to}} {{be moving}} now," [...] Geoffrey said at last. [...] "I think the best way will be {{for me to get}} {{by the side of the}} dormer window instead of above it. It would be very awkward leaning over there, and I should not have {{strength}} to strike a blow; whereas with the rope <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> and <b>my</b> foot on the edge of the sill, which projects a few inches beyond the side of the window, I could stand upright and strike a downright blow on the crossbow." ...|$|R
60|$|After {{the captain}} left me I {{looked around and}} saw {{that no one else}} was nigh upon the deck. I took my {{calabash}} gourds and entered the boat that hung from the davits astern. Taking a hint from Captain Leach, I had secured a coil of line by which I might lower myself into the water, for if I had dropped with a splash I would have been pretty sure to have been discovered. Having removed my shoes and stockings, which I wrapped in a piece of tarpaulin, together with my tinder-box and flint and steel, all of which I secured upon my head, and having slipped the cords which bound the calabashes <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> I slid down the line into the water astern.|$|R
6000|$|... "Before I open this," [...] I remarked, {{pointing}} to the portfolio <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm,</b> [...] "my mind is made up, sir, about one thing. If I wasn't married already, I tell you this--I should envy you your wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I thanked him, and {{was very}} grateful. He wished me a merry Christmas and went out. I tied the thing up in brown paper, and took it <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm.</b> It was a fine bird, but heavy.|$|E
60|$|I was {{a little}} {{astonished}} at his familiar address, for I had never set eyes on the man before. I {{was a little}} annoyed, too, at his catching me with my boots <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm.</b> He noticed my lack of cordiality.|$|E
60|$|I {{lived for}} several years on the islands which are nameless to me, and upon which I am {{confident}} I was the first white man. I was married to Lei-Lei, the king's sister, who was a fraction over six feet and only by that fraction topped me. I was a splendid figure of a man, broad-shouldered, deep-chested, well-set-up. Women of any race, as you shall see, looked on me with a favouring eye. <b>Under</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> sun-shielded, <b>my</b> skin was milk-white as my mother's. My eyes were blue. My moustache, beard and hair were that golden-yellow such as one sometimes sees in paintings of the northern sea-kings. Ay--I must have come of that old stock, long-settled in England, and, though born in a countryside cottage, the sea still ran so salt in my blood that I early found my way to ships to become a sea-cuny. That is what I was--neither officer nor gentleman, but sea-cuny, hard-worked, hard-bitten, hard-enduring.|$|R
60|$|In {{a moment}} or two, I am thankful to say, my courage returned. I struck a match and lit a cigar, {{one of a handful}} which Ray had forced upon me. Then I crossed stealthily {{to the other side of}} the road, and felt for the hedge. I pricked my hands badly, but after feeling about for some moments I was able to cut for myself a {{reasonably}} thick stick. With this in my right hand, and the dispatch-box <b>under</b> <b>my</b> left <b>arm</b> I proceeded on my way.|$|R
60|$|But {{neither of}} them would do it. They wanted me to drop my prize, and then they'd take hold of me and take me in. We were disputing and puffing, and {{floating}} further and further away, when up came Captain Chris, swimming like a shark. He had jerked off his clothes and jumped in, when he saw what was going on. He just put one hand <b>under</b> <b>my</b> right <b>arm,</b> in which I held the sea-feather, and then we struck out together for the boat. It was like getting a tow from a tug-boat. We were alongside in no time. Captain Chris was the strongest and best swimmer I ever saw.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I was dishplease dat the personability av that remark, so I tucks him <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> an' carries him to Crook who was watchin' how {{the fight}} wint. Crook cuffs him till the bhoy cries, an' thin sez nothin' for a whoile.|$|E
60|$|It was a chill, dismal afternoon, the Heath deserted, a thin rain commencing. I {{slipped off}} {{my shirt and}} jacket, and rolling them <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm,</b> trotted off alone, hare and hounds {{combined}} in one small carcass, to chase myself sadly by myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was dishpleased at the personability av that remark, so I tucks him <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> an' carries him to Crook who was watchin' how {{the fight}} wint. Crook cuffs him till the bhoy cries, an' thin sez nothin' for a whoile.|$|E
60|$|I wished now {{to bring}} our uncouth sled to a stop, and to {{endeavor}} to make {{the rest of the}} descent on foot. But although I stuck out my heels and tried to thrust the handle of my shovel into the ground, it was of no use. On we went, and the inequalities of the surface gave an irregularity of motion which was uncomfortable and alarming. We turned to this side and that, we bounced and bumped, and the rawhide ropes, which must have been greatly frayed and cut by the snow crust, now gave way in several places, and I knew that the mattress would soon separate into its original cushions, if indeed they still could be called cushions. Fearing increased danger should we now continue bound together in a bunch, I jerked apart the shawl-knot <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> and the next moment, it seemed to me, there was a general dissolution of our connection with each other. Fortunately, we were now {{near the bottom of the}} slope, for while some of us stuck fast to the cushions, others rolled over, or slid, independent of any protection; while I, being thrown forward on my feet, actually ran down-hill! I had just succeeded in stopping myself, when down upon me came the rest of the company, all prostrate in some position or other.|$|R
6000|$|... "'You'll blow me head off,' I sez, throwin' <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> clear; 'go through <b>under</b> <b>my</b> arm-pit, ye bloodthirsty little scutt,' sez I, 'but don't shtick me or I'll wring {{your ears}} round.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"You'll blow me head off," [...] I sez, throwin' <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> clear; [...] "go through <b>under</b> <b>my</b> arm-pit, ye bloodthirsty little scutt," [...] sez I, [...] "but don't shtick me or I'll wring {{your ears}} round." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This fear--this heavy armour. I can't help shuddering as I feel it <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm.</b> I could fancy it a {{story of}} enchantment--that some {{malignant}} fiend had changed your sensitive human skin into a hard shell. It seems so unlike my bright, light-hearted Tito!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well, my dear," [...] said Richard, [...] "we won't go {{into that}} now. I want to appear quietly in your country-house here, with you <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm,</b> and give my charming cousin a surprise. I suppose your loyalty to John Jarndyce will allow that?" ...|$|E
60|$|But {{it was not}} for long. He {{was down}} again in a minute, and, passing his hand <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm,</b> he half led and half carried me out of the house. It was not until we were in the fresh night air again that he opened his mouth.|$|E
6000|$|... "I had, {{during the}} time we {{had been on the}} journey, abstained from {{staining}} <b>my</b> skin <b>under</b> <b>my</b> garments, in order that I might be recognized as a white man, as soon as I bared <b>my</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Countess,' said I, 'you are now <b>under</b> <b>my</b> protection. You are faint, and a {{glass of}} wine is {{necessary}} to restore you.' I offered her <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> and escorted her into my room, where she sat by my side at the table and took the refreshment which I offered her.|$|R
60|$|Next morning, heavily {{laden with}} my parasol, a biscuit {{or two in}} my bag, my Sense and Sensibility and a rug in <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> I set off very early for Wanderslore, having {{arranged}} with Mrs Bowater over night that she should meet me <b>under</b> <b>my</b> beech at a quarter to one.|$|R
60|$|My late {{experiences}} with Mr. and Mrs. Micawber suggested {{to me that}} here might be a means of keeping off the wolf for a little while. I went up the next by-street, took off my waistcoat, rolled it neatly <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm,</b> {{and came back to}} the shop door.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{took down}} from the shelves a volume of sermons which his father {{published}} many years ago, and presented it to me. I have it now <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm.</b> It hath the old bishop's manuscript notes, which I will study carefully." [...] And thus the archdeacon had hit his bird on both wings.|$|E
6000|$|... '"Then {{see that}} the thirty pounds you've saved on it are {{honestly}} paid the King," [...] I says, [...] "and keep clear o' women-folk." [...] I gathered up my draft and crumpled it <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm.</b> [...] "If that's all you need of me I'll be gone," [...] I says. [...] "I'm pressed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She has fainted, Tim," [...] he said. [...] "Help me {{to raise}} her well in <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> and lay her head on my shoulder. That's right. Now, you'll find her shawl somewhere <b>under</b> <b>my</b> feet; hold it up, and make a fan of it. Now, try to send some air into her face." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was dark}} down {{there by the}} stables, and I was peering round for the hostler, when {{suddenly}} <b>my</b> two <b>arms</b> were seized from behind. There were hands at my wrists and at my throat, and I felt the cold muzzle of a pistol <b>under</b> <b>my</b> ear.|$|R
5000|$|The train, {{struggling}} and grating amid the clashing sound of steel, hauled us across the island, which {{is covered by}} teak trees and bamboos whose branches brushed our faces. The temperature was very high and the sun, filtering through the trees, roused noxious fever-vapours from the tangled undergrowth. Sweat caked <b>my</b> hair <b>under</b> <b>my</b> sun hat; the heat burned <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> through <b>my</b> clothes; and the mosquitoes took advantage of my predicament to attack me as they pleased, all over my hands and face… John Keay ...|$|R
