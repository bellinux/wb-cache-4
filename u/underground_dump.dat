5000|$|When {{a murder}} occurs, a [...] "class trial" [...] (gakyū saiban) is held, {{in which the}} {{remaining}} students must determine amongst themselves who the killer is. As the game progresses, several students are killed, and Makoto frequently takes the role of arbiter of the trial, and provides most of the logical insights. Makoto receives assistance from Kyoko Kirigiri, a mysterious girl with no recollection of her past, but possessing keen observational and deductive skills. However, through their investigations, it becomes clear to the remaining students that regardless of what they do, Monokuma {{has no intention of}} letting them leave the academy. In addition, following each trial, after a period of time has passed, Monokuma instigates further strife by direct manipulation: threatening students' families, threatening to reveal embarrassing secrets, or offering a bounty to provoke the remaining students. In the penultimate trial, while it has become obvious to the player that the person controlling Monokuma committed the [...] "murder", the only possible culprits from the surviving students are either Makoto or Kyoko. In the canon plot, Makoto, placing his faith in Kyoko, withholds evidence that could potentially implicate her as the killer, and is summarily declared guilty by Monokuma without a vote. However, during Makoto's execution, he is saved by an artificial intelligence previously introduced into the school's computer network and instead falls into an <b>underground</b> <b>dump.</b> Escaping from the dump with help from Kyoko, the surviving students band together to work against Monokuma, and find out the true mastermind behind the death game is Junko Enoshima, one of the students previously thought killed, but who had, in fact, employed her twin sister, Mukuro Ikusaba, to impersonate her, only to ultimately kill her on a whim.|$|E
50|$|Musselwhite mine uses a gold cyanidation and CIP (carbon in pulp) {{extraction}} process. Ore {{is extracted}} via a blast hole process and moved via {{a series of}} scoop-trams and <b>underground</b> <b>dump</b> trucks to one of 2 rockbreakers, either on the surface or at a 400 meter level. The ore then travels once through a jaw crusher and {{through a series of}} conveyor belts and countinously along a cone crusher rock sizing circuit. When the ore reaches a specific size it is transported to the mill building where the ore passes once through a rod mill and multiple times through a ball mill until the slurry is ground to approximately 10 µm. The slurry is then thickened, exposed to a cyanide treatment to extract it from the ore and into the solution, absorbed from the solution with activated carbon, rinsed off the carbon, passed through an electrowinning process and finally melted in a furnace and poured into 25 kg bars. The leftover tailings are passed though an INCO/SO2 cyanide destruction process. The remaining tailings are sent though a final thickening stage and are pumped into the tailings pond composed of approximately 85% solids and very little cyanide. Twice a year the excess water is drained off the tailings pond where it flows naturally through a series of polishing ponds and a freshwater marsh. By the time the runoff reaches the natural watershed system the cyanide content is drastically reduced and poses no environmental or safety hazard. The total recovery of this process is approximately 96%. Electrical power is proved by a 115 kV running from Ear Falls to Pickle Lake and a private line from there to the site. However due to the reasonably low voltage of a line that length the losses are quite high, the site only has access to about 19 kV, stalling further development plans such as a mine shaft. Additional power as required or {{in the event of an}} outage is provided by a series of large diesel generators on site.|$|E

40|$|Poultry {{slaughterhouse}} waste (PSHW) consists of, blood, feathers and other body parts of chicken (broilers) that cannot be sold or used for value addition. A few years back, this waste caused major disposal problems in broiler farms in Sri Lanka. The most popular disposal method that was adopted was {{to dump the}} waste in <b>underground</b> waste <b>dumps,</b> away from human settlements and water bodies. The highly nutritious, high protein high nitrogen, high phosphorous, leachate of these <b>underground</b> waste <b>dumps</b> caused pollution of soil and ground water and the surface runoffs sometimes polluted surface water bodies, such as rivers and lakes. With environmental laws {{becoming more and more}} stringent and the authorities becoming more forceful, most of the major chicken producers have installed Waste Rendering Plants (WRP), which convert PSHW into high protein poultry feed. However, WRPs have not been able reduce waste to zero, since, after separation of the solids as feed to WRP, there is a liquid effluent that has to be treated. Prior to sending this liquid effluent to activated sludge treatment plants, the suspended solids are skimmed out in Settling Tanks and Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) Tanks and are called the Rendering Plant Sludge (RPS). RPS has around 30 % solids and 70 % water and cannot be composted or biologically treated due to its high fat content, which is more than, 10 % on a wet basis and 33 % on a dry basis. RPS cannot be incinerated too, due to the very high moisture content. Due to this difficulty, RPS is buried in lined <b>underground</b> waste <b>dumps.</b> The author undertook a research project, to convert RPS into organic fertilizer, using Delta-D Technology, for a leading broiler chicken producer, Nelna Farms, in Hanwella, in the Western Province of Sri Lanka in August, 2007. After appropriate laboratory research, a method was developed to digest the organic components in RPS, such as, collagen, fat and protein using the digestive fluid Delta-D, mixing with saw dust or agricultural waste to enhance the Carbon:Nitrogen Ratio to around 30 : 1 and finally neutralizing the mass with powdered dolomite and rock phosphate. The organic fertilizer produced was tested for around 1 year by applying to flowering plants, vegetables plots and tender and mature fruit plants and the yields were extremely satisfactory. In November 2008, the author carried out a demonstration on the process of manufacture at the Nelna Factory, {{in the presence of the}} Plant Manager (PM) and his staff and around 100 kg of organic fertilizer produced at the demonstration were handed over to PM for testing.

40|$|In coal mining, {{spontaneous}} combustion {{can occur in}} many areas such as stockpiles, <b>underground</b> workings, waste <b>dumps,</b> coal faces, in-pit ramps and backfill areas. Spontaneous combustion {{has been defined as}} an oxidation reaction, which occurs without an external heat source. Although not limited to coal, the most significant hazard of {{spontaneous combustion}} is the fires that occur in coal mining operations around the world. These fires pose a serious risk to the safety of workers in the coal mines. This phenomenon also has an environmental impact, which can affect {{the quality of life for}} future generations. Extensive research work has been done and recorded about spontaneous combustion in coal stockpiles, dumps and coal faces, but very limited work has been conducted on raw coal storage bunkers. This study investigated the occurrence of spontaneous combustion in coal storage bunkers, and established that there is no single document available that addresses the problem adequately. Therefore, a need was identified to create a guideline with decision analyser steps to be able to arrive quickly at a possible solution to the problem. This work does not address spontaneous combustion in <b>underground</b> workings, waste <b>dumps,</b> stockpiles, coal faces, in-pit ramps and backfill areas. It was found that important factors affecting the possibility of SC occurring were the type of coal being supplied to the bunker, the mining practice with regard to the standing time of the loose cubic metres of coal on the mining benches, and the impact of the physical factors around the bunker. The information obtained could be of great significance when designing or trying to solve spontaneous combustion problems in raw coal storage bunkers. The guideline and decision analyser steps can be applied early in the phase of the project in order to minimise or eliminate similar mistakes made in the industry over the years.

Nothing {{could be further from}} the truth. Geothermal energy is in fact an incredible store of energy found in all parts of the world which is beginning to be understood and used for our sustainable future. There are two basic forms of this energy. One form (sometimes referred to as hot dry rocks or enhanced geothermal systems), makes use of the heat (> 200 °C) in the rocks at depths of up to about 5 kms to produce electricity from extracted (but returnable) hot water. There are several locations around the world where “proof of concept” stage has been or about to be reached suggesting that within the next few years, these systems may be providing a significant proportion of our base-load electricity. The other form makes use of the heat (and the cooling potential) of the soils and rocks within the upper few tens of metres from the surface to heat and cool buildings. It involves the circulation of a fluid through pipes built into building foundations or in specifically drilled boreholes, and back to the surface where heat stored in the fluid is extracted by a heat pump, and used to heat a building. The cooled fluid is reinjected into the ground loops to heat up again to complete the cycle. In cooling mode, the system is reversed with heat taken out of the building transferred to the fluid which is injected <b>underground</b> to <b>dump</b> the extra heat to the ground.

40|$|Unlike most leaf-cutting ants, {{which have}} <b>underground</b> waste <b>dumps,</b> the leaf-cutting ant Atta colombica dumps waste {{in a heap}} outside the nest. Waste is hazardous, as it is {{contaminated}} with pathogens. We investigated {{the organization of the}} workforce involved in outside-nest tasks (foraging, waste disposal) and quantified task switching and heap location to test hypotheses that these tasks are organized to minimize contact between the heap and foraging entrances and trails. Waste management is an important task: 11 % of externally working ants were either transporting waste or manipulating waste on the heap, and the other 89 % were foragers. There is strict division of labor between foragers and waste workers, with no task switching. Waste management also has division of labor and is undertaken by transporters that carry waste to the heap margins and heap workers that manage the heap. Waste heaps are always located downhill from nest entrances. The distance to the waste heap is positively related to colony size and negatively related to slope. Foraging trails avoid the heap, with 92 % of trails going away from the heap. This avoidance behavior is costly, increasing foraging trail length by at least 6 %. Waste management in A. colombica is a sophisticated system that encompasses both work and spatial organization. This organization is probably adaptive in reducing disease transmission. Division of labor separates waste management from foraging, reducing the likelihood of foragers becoming contaminated with waste. The downhill location of heaps reduces waste entering entrances during rain. The orientation of foraging trails reduces the possibility of foragers becoming accidentally contaminated with waste.

40|$|Les zones minières de Silter di Campolungo et de Baita Cludona di Fondo sont situées dans le Val Grigna, qui met en {{communication}} le Val Camonica avec le Val Trompia par le col de Goletto di Cludona et se situent sur les communes de Bienno et de Collio. Deux kilomètres séparent les deux sites. Dans cette région, la roche encaissante est constituée de sédiments détritiques de {{la formation}} de Collio, d’âge Permien inférieur, traversés par des failles minéralisées. Datées du Premier Âge du fer, ces deux mines de cuivre ont fait l’objet de plusieurs campagnes de recherche. À Campolungo, les travaux s’échelonnent sur une dénivelée de 100 m entre 1 535 m et 1 635 m. Pour atteindre les filons minéralisés, les mineurs ont creusé un travers-banc d’exhaure de près de 120 m de développement, mettant en relation les chantiers profonds et assurant en permanence l’exhaure. L’abattage associait la taille au feu et l’utilisation de maillets et de masses en quartz; la présence d’une galerie d’aérage témoigne de cette méthode d’exploitation. La mine de Campolungo est ainsi dotée d’une infrastructure et d’ouvrages techniques d’assistance parfaitement planifiés et remarquables pour une époque aussi reculée. Pour transporter le minerai, les mineurs utilisaient des traîneaux en bois monoxyles dont un exemplaire a été découvert. Le mobilier retrouvé atteste l’utilisation par les mineurs de maillets de forme sphérique ou polygonale et de pics en roche. De très nombreux fragments de torches ont été également découverts. Un soutènement en bois a été installé pour favoriser l’accès aux chantiers. Les stériles stockés sous terre témoignent d’un premier tri sélectif à l’intérieur de la mine. En amont du Val Grigna, un deuxième gîte cuprifère s’étage entre 1 620 m et 1 670 m d’altitude. Trois filons, sensiblement parallèles, se développent sur la surface d’érosion qui modèle la rive gauche du torrent. L’extraction s’effectuait par dépilage descendant. Des carottages polliniques effectués dans deux tourbières proches mettent en évidence plusieurs phases de déforestation dont l’origine remonte au début de l’Âge du fer (vers 900 av. J. -C.). L’activité minière à Campolungo était sensiblement contemporaine de celle de Baita Cludona di Fondo. Les déforestations ont été provoquées par la production de charbon de bois qui alimentait les fourneaux et les forges construits en amont du Val Gabbia, et en aval dans le Val delle Forme. En surface, les mines de Silter di Campolungo et de Baita Cludona di Fondo sont jalonnés de haldes et d’espaces aménagés où s’effectuaient le tri, le concassage et le broyage du minerai. La fouille d’un atelier de minéralurgie a livré de nombreux artefacts : percuteurs, pierres à cupules, mortiers et meules en pierre. Un fragment de moulin rotatif figure parmi le mobilier ainsi que plusieurs tessons de céramique datés des VIe-Ve siècles av. J. -C. Quelques scories de cuivre ont été recueillies en position secondaire. Le processus de réduction utilisé s’apparente à la production de matte (nonslag tapping furnaces). Dans cette région couverte de gravures rupestres comme le Val Camonica, le district minier de Campolungo figure comme l’un des très rares espaces fréquentés durant la Préhistoire où les gravures sont inexistantes. L’hypothèse d’une répartition territoriale en relation avec l’exploitation des ressources minérales est une hypothèse à privilégier. Val Camonica {{is well known}} for its large and exceptional quantity of rock carvings, but it is also an area rich in metallic ores. Two groups of mining works have been explored and are the subject of this paper. The mining areas of Silter di Campolungo and of Baita Cludona di Fondo are in Val Grigna, a small hanging valley of glacial origin. It lies in the territories of the communities of Bienno and Collio. The mining area of Val Trompia to the east of Val Camonica can be reached through Val Grigna and the Goletto di Cluodona pass. The distance between the two groups of mines of Silter di Campolungo to the north and Baita Cludona di Fondo to the south is 2 km as the crow flies. The bedrock in the area is formed by a sequence of siliceous sediments belonging to the Collio formation, lower Permian in age. They are layers of massive sandstones and conglomerates with a sandstone matrix of various thicknesses (from decimetres to metres). This formation is crossed by faults which are mineralized with 15 - 20 cm thick veins of chalcopyrite-bearing white epigenetic quartz. These two copper mines, which have been dated to the Early Iron Age, were the subject of archaeological exploration between 1997 and 2002. Their study has shown some mining techniques previously unknown for that age. The mining activity at Campolungo begun as an opencast mine with the excavation of deep trenches where the ore was visible on the surface. These works begin at 1535 m above sea level and reach an attitude of 1635 m. At 1535 m there is the opening of the drainage adit while the higher altitude corresponds to the last of the opencast works. In order to reach the deepest copper lodes of Campolungo the ancient miners dug an adit about 120 m long. In this way they were able to connect the deepest excavations of the mine and to create an excellent permanent drainage system. The rock was dug by fire setting and by using heavy spherical lumps of quartz and sandstone picks. To carry the ore out of the mine large wooden rectangular sleighs were used, one of which was discovered near the rock face. It points to the organized management of the underground transport. Among the tools found in the mines there are polygonal or spherical quartz mauls and sandstone picks. Many fragments of resinous wood torches were also found in the underground galleries. Underhand and overhand stoping were used to extract the ore. Special timbering techniques were used to help with the management of the working space and to reach the different working areas easily. The spoil <b>dumps</b> <b>underground</b> show that a first sorting was performed in the mine itself. Prospecting in the upper part of Val Grigna allowed us to discover a second copper ore deposit at an altitude of between 1620 and 1670 m above sea level. On the eroded surface on the left-hand side of the stream and {{at the foot of a}} rocky cliff there are three ore veins, two of which are more or less parallel. The veins were worked by underhand stoping from the surface. The pollen samples from the two peat bogs close to the mining sites show the variation of the forest cover in the area. Forest clearing began during the Early Iron Age at about 900 BC. These data confirm that the mining activities at Campolungo are contemporary with those at Baita Cludona di Fondo. The numerous charcoal pits of the area testify a rich charcoal production, which could be the reason for ancient deforestation. Possibly this charcoal was used in the ancient furnaces and forges in the nearby Val Gabbia or lower down in Val delle Forme. In both the mining areas of Silter di Campolungo and Baita Cludona di Fondo specific places were used for the mine spoil dumps and for the primary ore dressing activities : sorting, washing, crushing and grinding. One of these sites on the right bank of the Grigna stream was thoroughly excavated. On this site many stone tools were found : hammers, mortars and millstones. Some of these tools were made from imported rocks such as vulcanite from Mt. Auccia, 3 km away as the crow flies. More often vein quartz and the hard siliceous sandstone from the mine itself were used to make these tools. The fragment of a tool interpreted as a rotary grinding stone was found too. A few sherds dating from the 6 th- 5 th century BC were also discovered on this site. A small amount of copper slag in secondary deposition was found too. Its study and analyses have shown that it is connected to copper matte production. These mining works are not the remains of “ informal” mining activities, but show the high level of technical knowledge which allowed the ancient miners to extract the ore from the deepest lodes. The mine structures discovered at Campolungo are exceptional, the underground works allowed an excellent exploitation of the mineralized veins. This means that the mining operations were coordinated and directed by some authority. The way the galleries were dug and their plans point to the knowledge of precision measuring systems. The Campolungo and Baita Cludona di Fondo mines show that during the Early Iron Age there were already infrastructures and perfectly organized technical assistance for this sort of enterprise. These infrastructures imply the existence of a central authority with economic and political power sufficiently developed to organize a mining operation on such a scale in such a remote place. Such power can only exist in a highly hierarchized society. The Campolungo and Baita Cludona mining area is one of the very few places of Val Camonica devoid of any prehistoric rock-carvings. This fact could be connected with the mining activities; the carving of rocks may have implied some magical/ religious meanings in contrast with the ore extraction activities. Because of this the hypothesis of a land division in relationship with the exploitation of natural resources must be taken into consideration. Morin Denis, Tizzoni Marco.
