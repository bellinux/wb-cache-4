The mutant lacks 4 -thiouridine in its tRNA and does not exhibit the near <b>u.</b> <b>v.</b> -induced growth delay. Although the two strains exhibit similar sfiA induction levels after 254 nm irradiation, their behaviour is different after illumination with near <b>u.</b> <b>v.</b> light, including solar <b>u.</b> <b>v.</b> Inducibility is 10 - 20 times higher in the nuvA mutant than in the parent strain. Furthermore, pre-illumination with broad band near <b>u.</b> <b>v.</b> light does not affect the 254 nm-induced sfiA response in the mutant but reduces it by a factor of 3 - 4 in the parent strain. The kinetics of sfiA induction in near <b>u.</b> <b>v.</b> -illuminated nuvA+ cells, whether treated with 254 nm light or not, is unusual and follows the growth curve: only after 50 min is sfiA derepression observed. It can be concluded that (i) near <b>u.</b> <b>v.</b> -induced DNA lesions are able to trigger the SOS response and (ii) the growth delay effect reduces this response, whether triggered by <b>u.</b> <b>v.</b> or near <b>u.</b> <b>v.</b> light.
