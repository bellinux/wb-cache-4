50|$|Fitzsimmons and Guilbert first {{described}} male <b>uniovular</b> <b>twins,</b> aged 20 years, {{who had had}} slowly progressive spastic paraplegia from early in life. Both had skeletal abnormalities of the hands and feet: brachydactyly, cone-shaped epiphyses, and an abnormal metaphyseal-phalangeal pattern profile. In addition, they had nonspecific dysarthria and low-normal intellectual capacity.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} {{available}} online at www. ssjournals. com Intrauterine twin gestation with demise {{of one of the}} foetuses pose anxiety in the mind of obstetrician, patient and the relatives. It is an uncommon complication of <b>uniovular</b> <b>twins</b> having monochorionic placenta. Fetal demise {{in the first half of}} pregnancy does not have adverse effect on the mother. Surviving co-twin is at risk of development of growth restriction, cerebral encephalomalacia and microcephaly. We present a case of 32 weeks of twin gestation with intrauterine fetal demise of one baby with hypofibrinogenemia and gestational hypertension. She was successfully managed with good maternal and fetal outcome...|$|E
40|$|The non-haemolytic anaemias of {{the newborn}} have {{recently}} {{attracted the attention}} of many investigators. Of particular interest has been the anaemia due to occult blood loss of the foetus into the maternal circulation (Wiener, 1948; Chown, 1954; Gunson, 1957. Another type of intrauterine occult blood loss has been recognized {{in the last few years}} as being due to transfusion of blood from one <b>uniovular</b> <b>twin</b> to the other through anastomotic vessels in th...|$|R
40|$|A {{descriptive}} {{epidemiological study}} of simple hypospadias—that is, hypospadias without coexisting malformation outside the genital system—in a birth population of 46, 927 singleton males and 1, 013 twin males {{showed that the}} condition was significantly more common (P < 0 · 001) in <b>uniovular</b> <b>twin</b> males than in either singleton or binovular twin males. Also the temporal distribution of dates of conception had a significant cyclic pattern for each year of the study. Both observations are thought to {{support the view that}} gonadotrophin levels at stage 3 sexual organogenesis play an important part in normal masculinization of male external genitalia...|$|R
40|$|Multiple births {{were studied}} {{in a sample}} of {{orthodox}} Jewesses for whom an estimate could be made of the day of ovulation and the earliest possible day of conception. The overall rate of twinning was 14. 5 / 1, 000 deliveries, and of triplets, 0. 40 / 1, 000. Twinning rates varied significantly from 11. 4 in the 5, 976 "early" conceptions (day - 1 or earlier relative to the estimated day of ovulation) to 26. 9 in the 1, 498 "late" conceptions (day 0 or later). Triplets varied significantly from 0 to 2. 01 in early and late conceptions, respectively, and unlike-sexed multiple sets, 2. 8 and 12. 8, respectively. The excess of multiple births in late conceptions was seen within different ages and origin groups, in women with different menstrual characteristics, and in those with and without treatment for anovulation. While the excess of unlike-sexed sets seems to lead to the conclusion that late conceptions are associated with dizygosity, polar body <b>twinning</b> and <b>uniovular</b> dispermatic <b>twinning</b> should also be considered...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} several reports of polycythaemia in one of <b>uniovular</b> <b>twins</b> with anaemia in the other twin. This {{syndrome}} has been recently fully recorded and reviewed by Corney and Aherne (1965). We describe here a severe example of this condition, with jaundice in the polycythaemic twin necessitating exchange transfusion. The severe anaemia in the other twin caused death in utero, {{and the birth of}} a macerated foetus. The twins showing intraplacental transfusion are described. Successful treatment of the polycythaemia and hyperbilirubinaemia is described. Bilirubin estimation should be performed routinely in such cases because polycythaemia may mask severe jaundice. Furthermore, previous reports of the condition and its management are briefly discussed. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{happened}} to encounter a discordant schizophrenic case {{in one of}} <b>uniovular</b> <b>twins.</b> This patient is still yong so that we intend to follow up this case in the future, but {{for the time being}} we present this case as a discordant schizophrenia. 1. By the ovular examination this case has been verified as a uniovular case. 2. In the character test, namely, in Rorschach test and Uchida Kraepelin test, we found abnormalities not only in the patient but also in her twin-sister. This finding is noteworthy, so that it will not only help the ovular diagnosis but also suggests a possible danger of future nosogenesis. 3. By judging environmental differences between the twins, we have studies how these differences were related to the nosogenesis, and obtained the following data: (a) Both twins weighed only 1. 5 Kg. at the birth, and the patient's entire body was paler than her twin-sister then. At the age of these both contrasted whooping-cough, but the patient was severer than her sister. It appears that from that time on the patient has the delicate constitution. (b) In the first year of her junior-high school days (13 years old) she received a trauma on the hiatus and she has been worrying ever since, believing she had her hymen broken. (c) As for the direct cause inducing the physiological and mental tension, cystitis which she suffered for one whole year when she was 15 years old may be pointed out. Cystitis seems to be an important factor in this case, because according to Henri Baruck in a cystitic case there are substances in Coli bacillus which are toxicant to the brain, and consequently there is a possibility of presenting a phenomenon like in schizophrenia reaction. These three factors seem to heve played an important role for the onset of schizophrenia in this case...|$|E
40|$|IN {{the course}} of an {{investigation}} of twins a pair was discovered one of whom showed features of acromegaly while the other did not. They proved to be <b>uniovular</b> <b>twins,</b> and since they now differed so remarkably in stature and general configuration they were regarded as offering valuable and exception-ally rare material for the study of whatever hereditary factors may be concerned in acromegaly. The twins, Frank and Albert W., are now 46 years old. Their personal histories will be given separately after a brief account of the family history. Family History. -The family includes Scottish, English and Welsh members; on the mother's side there are many instances of unusually tall stature, none on the father's side. The paternal grandfather was about 5 ft. 2 in. in height; the paternal grand-mother died when the father of the twins was. a baby and there is no relevant informa-tion about her. The two paternal aunts were both ' little mites ' and the only paternal uncle was short and fat. The father of the twins was himself only 5 ft. 2 in. in height. He worked as a fish porter and was healthy for the greater part of his life; he died of a stroke at 65. The maternal grandfather was a tall man, 6 ft. 1 or 2 in., of Scottish birth, and had two sisters who were tall and ' rawboned. ' He was a healthy man, worked as a plumber and gas-fitter and {{died at the age of}} 50 through falling off a ladder. Concerning the maternal grandmother no information is available. The mother ofthe twins is now aged 79 and is still strong, energetic and in good health. She is a big woman, 5 ft. 10 in. in height; there is no disproportion of features or skeleton. All her sisters are over 5 ft. 8 in. tall, and one of them has married into another tall family, the members of which together with the offspring of the union are shown in the appended pedigree (fig. 3). Her only brother was 6 ft. tall. The members of the sibship in which the twins occurred are:- 1. Boy who died of fits when four months old...|$|E
