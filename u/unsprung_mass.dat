25|$|The {{standard}} {{brakes on}} the RS4 are of two-piece construction. The cast iron discs are cross-drilled and radially ventilated and float on aluminium alloy disc hubs. The two-piece disc construction reduces <b>unsprung</b> <b>mass</b> and also reduces {{the transmission of}} heat generated by the brakes to the wheel bearings.|$|E
25|$|The {{suspension}} of the 2CV was very soft; a person could easily rock the car side to side dramatically. The swinging arm, fore-aft linked suspension system with inboard front brakes had a much smaller <b>unsprung</b> <b>mass</b> than existing coil spring or leaf spring designs. The design was modified by Marcel Chinon.|$|E
25|$|The TRAXX P160 AC is the {{passenger}} {{version of this}} class, with a correspondingly higher top speed of 160km/h. A lower <b>unsprung</b> <b>mass</b> was achieved by using hollow shaft final drives instead of the axle hung motor arrangement of the 140km/h maximum speed versions.

A new scheme of the freight electric locomotive running gear is elaborated in the work, which ensures a decrease of <b>unsprung</b> <b>masses,</b> relative sliding of a wheel on the rail and an angle of attack that provides resistance to the destruction of the third body in the contact zone...|$|R
30|$|From the {{comparison}} between frequency of sprung mass motion and of wheels (<b>unsprung</b> <b>masses)</b> motion, it is clear both the significant difference of these frequencies and the almost independent vehicle body motion from wheels motion for all the examined vehicles.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{calculate}} the load on the track {{in the position of}} a sleeper at the time when an isolated axle of the vehicle passes, it is necessary to determine the mass of the railway track that participates in the movement of the <b>unsprung</b> <b>masses</b> of the vehicle. In this paper, the track is modelled as a vibrating string. Its movement is analysed theoretically, and the length that participates and influences the movement of the <b>unsprung</b> <b>masses</b> is calculated. The result of the theoretical calculation is compared to the results of the measurements that have been carried out in a number of countries. The influence of the dynamic stiffness and damping of the track is also investigated...|$|R
25|$|At its debut, {{the fourth}} {{generation}} model {{was shown in}} rear-wheel drive GS 350 (GRL10) form, powered by a V6 engine linked with a six-speed automatic transmission. Three driving modes are featured, ranging from fuel-conserving Eco to Sport S and Sport S+ which facilitate more sporty transmission shifting and engine throttle settings, as well as suspension damper and steering adjustments. The chassis has been redesigned, and overall curb weight is reduced. To reduce <b>unsprung</b> <b>mass</b> the new GS utilizes aluminum for all its suspension components. The GS 350 F Sport adds a rear-wheel steering system for improved handling on rear wheel drive models. New larger 14-inch brakes come standard as well as 19-inch F Sport wheels, a new front bumper, rear spoiler, F Sport steering wheel, F Sport seats and a new suspension system with AVS adjustable dampers.|$|E
25|$|When {{the railway}} opened in 1900, it was {{operated}} by electric locomotives hauling carriages with passengers boarding via lattice gates at each end. The locomotives {{had a large}} <b>unsprung</b> <b>mass,</b> which caused vibrations that could be felt in the buildings above the route. After {{an investigation by the}} Board of Trade, by 1903 the carriages had been adapted to run as trailers and formed with new motor cars into electric multiple units. The Central London Railway trains normally ran with six cars, four trailers and two motor-cars, although some trailers were later equipped with control equipment to allow trains to be formed with 3 cars. Work started in 1912 on an extension to Ealing Broadway, and new more powerful motor-cars were ordered. These arrived in 1915, but completion of the extension was delayed due to the outbreak of World War I, and the cars stored. In 1917 they were lent to the Bakerloo line, where they ran on the newly opened extension to Watford Junction. Returning in 1920/21 and formed with trailers converted from the original carriages they became the Ealing Stock. In 1925–28 the trains were rebuilt, replacing the gated ends with air-operated doors, allowing the number of guards to be reduced to two. After reconstruction of the Central London Railway tunnels, the trains were replaced by Standard Stock transferred from other lines and the last of the original trains ran in service in 1939.|$|E

The goals of a bike suspension are to reduce vibration experienced by the rider, maintain wheel contact with the ground, and maintain vehicle trim. The primary suspension parameters are stiffness, damping, sprung and <b>unsprung</b> <b>mass,</b> and tire characteristics.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is to {{estimate}} the vertical forces and to identify the unknown dynamic parameters of a vehicle using the sliding mode observers approach. The estimation of vertical forces needs a good knowledge of dynamic parameters such as damping coefficient, spring stiffness and <b>unsprung</b> <b>masses,</b> etc. In this paper, suspension stiffness and <b>unsprung</b> <b>masses</b> have been identified by the Least Square Method. Real-time tests {{have been carried out}} on an instrumented static vehicle, excited vertically by hydraulic jacks. The vehicle is equipped with different sensors in order to measure its dynamics.

40|$|The {{chatter of}} {{motorcycles}} appears during braking {{and consists of}} a vibration of the rear and front <b>unsprung</b> <b>masses</b> at a frequency {{in the range of}} 17 - 22 Hz depending on the motorcycle. This vibration could be very strong and acceleration of the <b>unsprung</b> <b>masses</b> can reach 5 - 10 g. The chatter is an auto-excited vibration and this fact explains why it appears suddenly when the mechanism of auto-excitation is generated. This paper presents the chatter phenomenon both from an experimental and a numerical point of view. First, the chatter is defined on the basis of some experimental data from racing motorcycles and from the comments of some racing teams technicians. Then, chatter is analysed in different motion conditions and for different braking styles by means of linear and non-linear simulations of the motorcycle dynamics. A physical interpretation of the phenomenon is also proposed...|$|R
40|$|The {{rail running table}} imposes to {{the vehicle}} a forced vibration. It is not smooth but instead it {{comprises}} a lot of faults that give to the rail running table a random surface. Furthermore under the primary suspension there are the <b>Unsprung</b> <b>Masses</b> which act without any dumping directly on the track panel. On the contrary the Sprung (Suspended) Masses that are cited above the primary suspension of the vehicle, act {{through a combination of}} springs and dumpers on the track. A part of the track mass is also added to the <b>Unsprung</b> <b>Masses,</b> which participates in their motion. The defects with long wavelength, which play a key role, on the dynamic component of the acting loads on the railway track, are analyzed using the second order differential equation of motion.

2500|$|Soon after opening, {{the company}} {{received}} complaints that vibration was {{felt in the}} buildings above the route. The Board of Trade appointed an investigating committee in January 1901, which reported in May that the problem {{was due to the}} large <b>unsprung</b> <b>mass</b> of the 44-ton locomotives, and the track. An experiment in August showed the vibrations could be reduced by rebuilding locomotives to reduce the <b>unsprung</b> <b>mass</b> to [...] tons. The following month, after four of the carriages had been converted into motor cars and fitted with British Thomson-Houston control equipment that had been invented by Frank J.

2500|$|Strangely, for {{the modern}} day observer, the {{aluminium}} clutch box {{was attached to the}} chassis, not to the engine, and the gear box, also aluminium, was attached to the rear axle, so was part of the <b>unsprung</b> <b>mass</b> of the suspension.

Randomly profiled terrain is assumed to impart hyperbolically distributed stationary vertical random displacements to the front and rear wheels. For generalization, nondimensional design parameters are selected. Criteria for optimization include the tire-terrain normal force as an indication of vehicle controllability and ride safety, vertical acceleration of the sprung mass as a measure of ride comfort, as well as the relative displacement of the suspension components referred to as the 2 ̆ 2 rattle space 2 ̆ 2. Optimum parameter synthesis is performed, producing a family of trade-off curves represented in three dimensional space...|$|R
40|$|The {{motion of}} a railway vehicle {{on the rail}} running table is a forced {{oscillation}} with a forcing excitation (force), and damping expressed by a random, non-periodic function. The motion is described by formulas and it is illustrated through diagrams which have {{the form of a}} "signal". The railway vehicle has the Suspended (Sprung) and the Non Suspended (<b>Unsprung)</b> <b>Masses.</b> The track defects/ faults are the random excitation for the rolling wheels of the vehicle. In the case of the Sprung Masses of the vehicles, the forces resulting from the excitation (track defects) are not large and have small effect on the rolling of the wheel. In the case of the <b>Unsprung</b> <b>Masses</b> the forces resulting from the excitation (track defects) are large and have grate effect on the rolling of the wheel. The track, is simulated (with the observer situated on the wheel) as an elastic means with damping.

2500|$|The Class {{was officially}} {{introduced}} into service in August 1965. The entire fleet was delivered into service within 24 months of that date.

40|$|Referring to the "Federal Government's National Development Plan for Electric Mobility" it is Germany's aim {{to become}} the lead market for {{electric}} mobility {{and to keep the}} leadership in science and automobile industries. The goal is to achieve one million electric vehicles on Germany's roads until 2020. To be competitive on this market new design optimized for electric vehicles need to be developed. One promising technology for the electric power train is the wheel hub motor. As they are integrated in the wheel, gears and drive shafts are obsolete enabling large potential for savings. In this paper the design and safety challenges for wheel hub motor engineers are described. Beside basic design features, the main focus is on loads for motor and chassis dimensioning. In particular the effects of increased <b>unsprung</b> <b>masses</b> are discussed on basis of measurement data collected with the Fraunhofer concept car.

2500|$|As in a coil-spring {{suspension}} design, the FRP mono-leaf {{spring supports}} {{the weight of}} the vehicle. However, the FRP leaf springs differ from steel coils and traditional steel multi-leaf springs in a number of significant ways. The FRP plastic springs have 4.3–5.5 times the strain energy storage per weight, compared to steel. This results in a lighter spring for a given application. The single FRP mono-leaf front spring used on the fourth-generation Corvette is 33percent of the weight of an equivalent set of coil springs. Comparing FRP to conventional steel leaf springs in similar applications, the weight saved is even greater. The third-generation Corvette offered an optional FRP mono-leaf spring {{as an alternative to the}} standard multi-leaf steel spring, the [...] steel spring being replaced by a [...] FRP spring. Volvo claims a weight savings of [...] by using a FRP spring in the rear suspension of its second-generation XC90, compared to designs using coil springs. In addition to the reduction in vehicle weight, {{the weight of the}} spring is partly <b>unsprung</b> <b>mass.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{suspension}} also automatically accommodates differing payloads in the car- {{with four}} people and cargo {{on board the}} wheelbase increases by around 4cm (2in) as the suspension deflects, and the castor angle of the front wheels increases {{by as much as}} 8 degrees thus ensuring that ride quality, handling and road holding are almost unaffected by the additional weight. On early cars friction dampers (like a dry version of a multi-plate clutch design) were fitted at the mountings of the front and rear swinging arms to the cross-tubes. Because the rear brakes were outboard, they had extra tuned mass dampers to damp wheel bounce from the extra <b>unsprung</b> <b>mass.</b> Later models had tuned mass dampers ("batteurs") at the front (because the leading arm had more inertia and [...] "bump/thump" [...] than the trailing arm), with hydraulic telescopic dampers / shock absorbers front and rear. The uprated hydraulic damping obviated the need for the rear inertia dampers. It was designed to be a comfortable ride by matching the frequencies encountered in human bipedal motion.|$|E
50|$|In {{a ground}} vehicle with a suspension, the <b>{{unsprung}}</b> <b>mass</b> (or the unsprung weight) is {{the mass of}} the suspension, wheels or tracks (as applicable), and other components directly connected to them, rather than supported by the suspension. (The mass of the body and other components supported by the suspension is the sprung mass.) <b>Unsprung</b> <b>mass</b> includes the mass of components such as the wheel axles, wheel bearings, wheel hubs, tires, and a portion of the weight of driveshafts, springs, shock absorbers, and suspension links.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} controlling a quarter-car hydraulic active suspension system using SMC techniques. The method guarantees {{the stability of the}} existence of a sliding mode and also the stability of the overall system. The proposed method considers many phases. In the first phase, the suspension dynamics is controlled via the actuator between the sprung and <b>unsprung</b> <b>masses.</b> Then the spool valve displacement dynamics is considered to control the current of the servo valve. Since there is an unknown parameter in the system an adaptation law is proposed to yield an appropriate estimate...|$|R
40|$|The chatter {{phenomenon}} of road racing motorcycles consists of self-excited vertical oscillations {{of both the}} front and rear <b>unsprung</b> <b>masses.</b> Even though in recent years this problem has been studied by several authors, its causing factors are still not clear. In the present study three different motorcycle models of increasing complexity are considered, from planar to three-dimensional multibody, in order to investigate the possible driving mechanism generating this self-excited vibration, and consequently to identify which of the model features {{may play a role in}} the actual vibration onset...|$|R
50|$|The <b>unsprung</b> <b>mass</b> of a wheel {{controls}} {{a trade-off}} between a wheel's bump-following ability and its vibration isolation. Bumps and surface imperfections {{in the road}} cause tire compression—which induces a force on the <b>unsprung</b> <b>mass.</b> The <b>unsprung</b> <b>mass</b> then responds to this force with movement of its own. The amount of movement, for short bumps, is inversely proportional to the weight - a lighter wheel which readily moves in response to road bumps will have more grip and more constant grip when tracking over an imperfect road. For this reason, lighter wheels are sought especially for high-performance applications. However, a lighter wheel which moves more will absorb less vibration; the irregularities of the road surface will transfer to the cabin through the geometry of the suspension and hence ride quality and road noise are thus worse. For longer bumps that the wheels follow, greater <b>unsprung</b> <b>mass</b> causes more energy to be absorbed by the wheels and makes the ride worse.|$|E
50|$|High <b>unsprung</b> <b>mass</b> also exacerbates {{wheel control}} issues under hard {{acceleration}} or braking. If the vehicle {{does not have}} adequate wheel location in the vertical plane (such as a rear-wheel drive car with Hotchkiss drive, a live axle supported by simple leaf springs), vertical forces exerted by acceleration or hard braking combined with high <b>unsprung</b> <b>mass</b> can lead to severe wheel hop, compromising traction and steering control.|$|E
50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{there is}} a positive effect of <b>unsprung</b> <b>mass.</b> High frequency road irregularities, such as the gravel in an asphalt or concrete road surface, are isolated from the body more completely because the tires and springs act as separate filter stages, with the <b>unsprung</b> <b>mass</b> tending to uncouple them.Likewise, sound and vibration isolation is improved (at the expense of handling), in production automobiles, by the use of rubber bushings between the frame and suspension, by any flexibility in the frame or body work, and by the flexibility of the seats.|$|E

Reduction of <b>unsprung</b> <b>masses</b> weight, improved aerodynamics, simplification of suspension layout reprent the main advantages associated with this solution.
