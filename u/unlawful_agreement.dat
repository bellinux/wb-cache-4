All the cases concerning common purpose complicity scenarios where unlawfulness has been an issue hinge on the doctrine of constructive crime, so I try to show {{that those who are}} invoking that doctrine of unlawfulness to support their normative case for extended joint enterprise liability are working from a mistaken doctrinal premise, because the doctrine of constructive crime {{in the development of the}} law of complicity was limited to homicides; whereas complicity’s doctrine of common intent applied to all unlawful joint enterprises. Furthermore, it is contended that <b>unlawful</b> <b>agreements</b> (conspiracies) in themselves do not supply a normative justification for this sort of complicity, even when the agreement is consummated, because the accessory does not take an equal normative position in an unintended collateral crime that is merely foreseen as a possibility...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{critical}} analysis of section 89 (5) of the National Credit Act, with specific focus on section 89 (5) (c). Although section 89 (5) deals {{with the consequences of}} <b>unlawful</b> credit <b>agreements</b> listed under section 89, this study will focus on the consequences of <b>unlawful</b> credit <b>agreements</b> of unregistered credit providers. The National Credit Act is the regulatory framework for the credit market in South Africa and it places an obligation on certain individuals or legal persons to register as credit providers. Credit providers who fail to register when they are required to do so face the consequence of having their credit agreements being void and unlawful. A further adverse consequence is that the credit providers rights to restitution for goods delivered or money lend will either be cancelled or forfeited to the State in terms of section 89 (5) (c). Case law will be utilised to demonstrate the far-reaching consequences of section 89 (5) (c). The key problem with section 89 (5) (c) of the National Credit Act {{is that it does not}} afford the court the opportunity to exercise a discretion when dealing with disputes concerning credit <b>agreements</b> which are <b>unlawful.</b> The common law action of unjustified enrichment, on the other hand, allows the court to exercise this discretion. The recent approval of the National Credit Amendment Bill has resulted in an amendment to section 89 (5).

"Every contract, {{combination}} in {{the form}} of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any contract or engage in any combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $100,000,000 if a corporation, or, if any other person, $1,000,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding 10 years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court." [...] Sherman Act 1890 §1 Preventing collusion and cartels that act in restraint of trade is an essential task of antitrust law. It reflects the view that each business has a duty to act independently on the market, and so earn its profits solely by providing better priced and quality products than its competitors. The Sherman Act §1 prohibits [...] "every contract, combination {{in the form}} of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce." [...] This targets two or more distinct enterprises acting together in a way that harms third parties. It does not capture the decisions of a single enterprise, or a single economic entity, even though the form of an entity may be two or more separate legal persons or companies. In Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp. it was held an agreement between a parent company and a wholly owned subsidiary could not be subject to antitrust law, because the decision took place within a single economic entity. This reflects the view that if the enterprise (as an economic entity) has not acquired a monopoly position, or has significant market power, then no harm is done. The same rationale has been extended to joint ventures, where corporate shareholders make a decision through a new company they form. In Texaco Inc. v. Dagher the Supreme Court held unanimously that a price set by a joint venture between Texaco and Shell Oil did not count as making an <b>unlawful</b> <b>agreement.</b> Thus the law draws a [...] "basic distinction between concerted and independent action". Multi-firm conduct tends to be seen as more likely than single-firm conduct to have an unambiguously negative effect and [...] "is judged more sternly". Generally the law identifies four main categories of agreement. First, some agreements such as price fixing or sharing markets are automatically unlawful, or illegal per se. Second, because the law does not seek to prohibit every kind of agreement that hinders freedom of contract, it developed a [...] "rule of reason" [...] where a practice might restrict trade {{in a way that is}} seen as positive or beneficial for consumers or society. Third, significant problems of proof and identification of wrongdoing arise where businesses make no overt contact, or simply share information, but appear to act in concert. Tacit collusion, particularly in concentrated markets with a small number of competitors or oligopolists, have led to significant controversy over whether or not antitrust authorities should intervene. Fourth, vertical agreements between a business and a supplier or purchaser [...] "up" [...] or [...] "downstream" [...] raise concerns about the exercise of market power, however they are generally subject to a more relaxed standard under the [...] "rule of reason".|$|E
40|$|It is well {{established}} that, absent some very special circumstances, agreements on price or certain other terms of trade by otherwise competing entities (i. e., 2 ̆ 2 horizontal agreements 2 ̆ 2) are unlawful per se under the Sherman Act. In practical effect, once {{the fact of the}} horizontal agreement has been established, an adverse impact on competition is presumed, and therefore that the plaintiff is spared the burden of proving such an impact. The principal task for plaintiffs in such cases, therefore, is establishing the existence of an agreement. In the ideal world (from plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 perspective), there would be 2 ̆ 2 hard 2 ̆ 2 evidence of a 2 ̆ 2 formal 2 ̆ 2 agreement. By 2 ̆ 2 formal 2 ̆ 2 agreement, I mean that the parties actually met or otherwise explicitly communicated agreement on a course of action, and by 2 ̆ 2 hard 2 ̆ 2 evidence, I mean that there is testimony from a live witness present when the communication occurred, a video or audio recording of the communication, or a document created by one of more of the parties that documents the fact of the agreement. Of course, the world is not always ideal and most of the litigated cases involve situations {{in which there is no}} hard evidence of a formal agreement. In such cases, the plaintiff is forced to ask the court to infer an agreement from circumstantial evidence. However, as we shall see, what makes this task difficult for the plaintiff is that it may involve some complex combination of a detective story (what actually happened?), where economic analysis is often an essential ingredient, and a theoretical legal argument (does what happened constitute an <b>unlawful</b> <b>agreement?).</b> It is the possibility of this complex combination of economic evidence and legal theory that also poses challenges for the court, whether in fashioning instructions for the jury or in ruling on motions (typically by defendants) for summary judgment, directed verdict, judgment notwithstanding the verdict and, most recently, motions to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. In what follows, I attempt to identify the challenges and to explain when and how economic analysis may be of assistance, but at the same time, identifying areas where the principal concerns are legal rather than economic, i. e., where legal creativity may be required for an effective solution. In that vein, the article will discuss the concept of 2 ̆ 2 facilitating practices 2 ̆ 2 and assess whether the concept may be useful in filling an important gap in the coverage of the Sherman Act...|$|E
40|$|The {{business}} {{culture for}} public companies demands transparency and openness. Investors and securities analysts demand information {{so that they}} can assess {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} a company. Underlying the securities laws is a policy that encourages full disclosure and information to the investing public. The Internet and other technology provide instant access and, more importantly, an almost limitless depth of historic statements and information. Faced with this culture, executives are counseled to be open about business strategies. However, this new openness has created new issues. Public disclosures made in the context of conference calls with securities investors and analysts (Investor Calls or Calls) have recently become an area of focus for both antitrust plaintiffs and the government. Faced with more rigorous pleading standards after Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, plaintiffs have scoured transcripts of Investor Calls to find support for claims that defendants have reached an <b>unlawful</b> <b>agreement</b> and used these Calls to signal one another. The government charged at least two companies with violations of the antitrust laws largely by virtue of statements made in Investor Calls. The use of statements in Investor Calls to establish an antitrust claim creates tension between the securities laws and the antitrust laws. On the one hand, the securities laws encourage executives to be forthcoming in making disclosures of material information. On the other hand, antitrust law instructs executives to take care to avoid disclosing information that could be competitively sensitive. Imagine an executive who is asked a question about future pricing plans. The executive is being counseled by the company’s securities lawyers to be open and forthcoming in his response. At the same time, the executive is being counseled by the company’s antitrust lawyers not to say too much. The tension is particularly strong where the information is not on its face anticompetitive—such as a new distribution plan, or a plan to create a more customer-friendly pricing structure. However, the disclosure of this information can be misconstrued or taken out of context, and serious antitrust liability can arise from keeping investors informed. This Article considers the extent to which such Calls may be immune from the antitrust law. Particularly in light of the tension described above, we conclude that many statements made during Investor Calls should be immune from antitrust attack under the implied preclusion doctrine, most recently explained by the Supreme Court in Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC v. Billing. We also conclude that public policy supports limiting the use of Investor Call statements in antitrust cases to those statements that are unambiguously anticompetitive...|$|E
40|$|Communication {{is useful}} and often {{necessary}} for rivals to coordinate price and output decisions. All {{would agree that}} evidence of communication on these issues is relevant {{to the issue of}} whether firms reached an illegal agreement or engaged in concerted action in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Most courts and commentators would go further and define agreement and concerted action to require communication of one kind or another. I call this view the objective theory of concerted action. Louis Kaplow has recently challenged this approach in three important articles, all of which argue that the focus on communications is misguided. Although he does not propose a fully specified definition, he suggests that a standard of successful oligopolistic interdependence [...] in which rivals reach a meeting of the minds [...] would provide a superior basis for identifying <b>unlawful</b> <b>agreements.</b> In this essay, I describe this subjective theory of concerted action and identify the equilibria that it includes and excludes. I then consider its likely costs and benefits relative to the current objective theory. I argue that it will deter few durable instances of oligopolistic interdependence that present law would not prohibit. On the other hand, it apparently immunizes some equilibria, even if reached through communication. If so, it would raise the possibility of new and problematic defenses to claims of illegal concerted action. Moreover, Kaplow excludes certain noncompetitive equilibria from the subjective standard on the ground that they do not involve the requisite meeting of minds. But these equilibria differ in only a few ways from other, strategic equilibria that arguably do involve the necessary meeting of minds. Reliance on the concept of a meeting of the minds to distinguish these equilibria would risk significant false positives...|$|R

5000|$|... ● Economics {{professor}} Richard Gilbert envisions {{the possibility}} that a coordination of enforcement and veto power in licensing among or between patentees might support the conclusion that [...] "the benefits from coordination could outweigh the risks to competition." [...] He compares the Krasnov case with Mason City Tent & Awning Co. v. Clapper. In Mason City a district court held <b>unlawful</b> an <b>agreement</b> between two patentees that provided for a joint defense fund and gave each of the patentees veto power over the other's grant of licenses. The patents appeared to be complementary patents, covering cab enclosure devices for tractors. Before the patents were issued, there were extensive discussions between the parties concerning the royalties they would charge, the licensing terms, and which firms they would license. The court concluded that the high degree of coordination between the patentees and in particular the joint defense fund and the veto power over licenses were an unlawful extension of the patent grant. But Gilbert disagreed, because of the complementarity he saw in the patents. He argued that this factor made the agreements more procompetitive than anticompetitive. He contrasted this fact pattern with that of Krasnov, which he considered [...] "unsurprisingly" [...] deemed illegal.|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] 2 ̆ 2 Suppose that A hires B to rob {{a bank in}} Massachusetts and A then hires C to rob a bank in Rhode Island. B and C {{have not}} met face to face, but each knows {{he is part of}} a {{conspiracy}} to rob banks in more than one state. All agree that no one will be killed in the robberies. A then procures D to get a car for use in the robberies. B uses D’s car to rob his bank. During the robbery of C’s bank, C pulls out a gun and shoots and kills the bank guard. Clearly, A, B, C, and D are all guilty of conspiracy to rob banks, the act to which they agreed. Clearly too, A, B, C, and D are not guilty of conspiracy to murder, because they never agreed to kill anyone. C, however, is guilty of murder, since he intentionally killed the bank guard without justification or excuse. But can A, B, and D also be charged with this murder? There are, of course, several ways in which one person may be guilty of a murder committed by another person. One is by the felony-murder rule, which historically has meant that one is guilty of murder if, in the course of committing a felony, one causes the death of another person. In this example, if the felony-murder rule applies, A, B, and D could be guilty of felony murder of the bank guard – a murder committed by their cofelon, C. But if the felony-murder rule is not applicable, either because the state has rejected the rule, as most commentators have long been urging states to do, or because the state legislature has defined felony murder as second degree murder and the prosecution wants to convict A, B, and D, as well as C of first degree murder of the guard, is there another basis for finding A, B, and D guilty? The doctrine of complicity, also known as aiding and abetting, is, of course, another way to make a person guilty of a murder committed by someone else. But would A, B, and D be guilty of murder of the bank guard on an aiding and abetting theory in this instance? On mens rea grounds, A, B, and D intended at most to encourage a robbery by C. In Model Penal Code terms, that was their purpose or “conscious objective. ” But their purpose was not to encourage C to kill anyone. They had expressly agreed that no one would be killed. They did not know that C would kill during the robbery. If aiding and abetting requires a purpose to facilitate the particular crime at issue, A, B, and D would not be guilty of murder of the bank guard by aiding and abetting. On actus reus grounds, there also would be a problem with complicity. A did hire C to rob the bank. He did actively set in motion the crime which resulted in the killing of the guard. But what did B and D really do to assist or encourage the robbery by C, much less C’s murder of the guard? All they did was to agree {{to be part of a}} larger conspiracy to rob banks. One could argue that they never facilitated C’s specific robbery, and that they did nothing to facilitate his killing of the guard. There is, however, an alternative way in which A, B, and D can be convicted of C’s murder of the guard. If the court finds that A, B, C, and D were in a conspiracy to rob the banks, and if C committed murder in furtherance of that conspiracy, then A, B, and D are all also guilty of murder, as long as they could reasonably have foreseen that such an event would occur in the course of their conspiracy. They could all be guilty of first degree murder, even though A, B, and D never met the bank guard, never assisted or encouraged C to kill him, never wanted C to kill him or knew C would kill him, and never even visited the bank or entered the state in which the bank was located! The rule by which this result is reached, called the Pinkerton rule, is one of the most controversial doctrines in modern criminal law. Broadly stated, the rule is that “any conspirator in a continuing conspiracy is responsible for the illegal acts committed by his cohorts in furtherance of the conspiracy, within the scope of the conspiracy, and reasonably foreseeable by the conspirators as a necessary or natural consequence of the <b>unlawful</b> <b>agreement.</b> ” This rule permits conviction of a crime that the accused did not intend, plan, want, or even know about, committed against a victim whom the defendant did not know or want to harm. The rule applies throughout the life of the conspiracy to all who originally agreed to join the conspiracy, unless the defendant overtly acted to disavow and/or defeat the conspiracy. The Pinkerton rule “is not universally followed. ” It is rejected in the Model Penal Code. Many state courts have interpreted their statutes to require more than membership in a conspiracy for complicity in substantive crimes committed in the course of that conspiracy. Commentary on Pinkerton in the academic world, much like commentary on felony murder and on conspiracy in general, is overwhelmingly negative. On the contrary, this article argues that the Pinkerton doctrine, far from being an aberration, is rather more an illustration of our existing criminal law and of some of the important theoretical assumptions behind it.

40|$|Transaction cost {{economics}} (2 ̆ 2 TCE 2 ̆ 2) has radically altered {{industrial organization}} 2 ̆ 7 s explanation for so-called 2 ̆ 2 non-standard contracts, 2 ̆ 2 including 2 ̆ 2 exclusionary 2 ̆ 2 agreements that exclude rivals from access to inputs or customers. According to TCE, such integration usually reduces transaction costs without producing anticompetitive harm. TCE has accordingly exercised growing influence over antitrust doctrine, with courts invoking TCE 2 ̆ 7 s teachings to justify revision of some doctrines once hostile to such contracts. Still, old habits die hard, even for courts of increasing economic sophistication. This Article critiques one such habit, namely, courts 2 ̆ 7 continuing claim that firms use market or monopoly power to impose exclusionary contracts on unwilling trading partners. In so doing, the Article {{takes issue with}} both the Harvard and Chicago Schools of Antitrust, normally seen as antagonists, {{each of which has}} erroneously embraced the 2 ̆ 2 market power 2 ̆ 2 model of contract formation. For the last several decades, courts have premised particular rules of antitrust liability upon the assumption that firms used preexisting market power to 2 ̆ 2 coerce 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 7 force 2 ̆ 2 trading partners to enter exclusionary agreements. Most notably, courts have held that a monopolist 2 ̆ 7 s use of such power to obtain an exclusionary agreement violates § 2 of the Sherman Act, without any additional showing that the agreement produced economic harm. Following similar logic, courts enforcing § 1 of the Act have banned tying agreements obtained by firms with market power, reasoning that sellers used their power to 2 ̆ 7 force 2 ̆ 2 buyers to enter such contracts. Finally, courts have invoked the market power model when holding that dealers or consumers can challenge <b>unlawful</b> <b>agreements</b> they have themselves entered and enforced, contrary to the common law doctrine of in pari delicto (2 ̆ 2 in equal fault 2 ̆ 2). Courts have reasoned that plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 participation in such contracts is involuntary, because defendants use market power to impose them. While modern courts sometimes consider evidence that such agreements produce benefits, they nonetheless assume that sellers employ market power to impose them and treat such coercive imposition as a harm coexisting with any efficiencies. These doctrines survive to this day, along with the market power model of contract formation, despite courts 2 ̆ 7 increasing economic sophistication. This Article locates the origin of these doctrines and the market power model in price theory 2 ̆ 7 s workable competition model, often associated with the 2 ̆ 2 Harvard School 2 ̆ 2 of Antitrust. Assumptions informing the workable competition model excluded the possibility that exclusionary agreements produced benefits, giving rise to the natural inference that firms with market power imposed such contracts against the will of trading partners. Courts embraced this account of these agreements and announced hostile doctrines resting upon the assumption that such contracts were expressions of market power 2 ̆ 2 used 2 ̆ 2 to impose them. While Chicago School scholars questioned these doctrines, their critique ironically rested upon a more precise price-theoretic account of how firms purportedly used market power to impose these agreements. In the past few decades, TCE has emerged as a competing paradigm for evaluating non-standard contracts. Building on the work of Ronald Coase, practitioners of TCE argued that many such contracts, including those that 2 ̆ 2 exclude 2 ̆ 2 rivals, can reduce the cost of transacting, particularly anticipated costs of opportunism made possible by relationship-specific investments. While most practitioners of TCE have ignored the means by which such contracts are formed, Coase himself once indicated that such integration was 2 ̆ 2 voluntary, 2 ̆ 2 albeit without elaboration. This Article elaborates on prior work by the author and others showing that firms can induce voluntary acceptance of these provisions by offering cost-justified discounts to trading partners who agree to them, thereby using the institution of contract to redefine background rights and obligations so as to minimize transaction costs. While courts have sometimes invoked TCE 2 ̆ 7 s beneficial characterization of such agreements, they have not recognized the implication, examined here, that such contracts are purely voluntary, clinging instead to the decades-old conclusion that firms use preexisting market power to impose them. TCE does not teach that all non-standard agreements reduce transaction costs. Moreover, parallel developments suggest that some such agreements may reduce economic welfare by raising rivals 2 ̆ 7 costs and conferring market power. Here again, however, {{there is no reason to}} believe that proponents of such agreements use market power to impose them. Instead, proponents can induce input suppliers to enter such contracts voluntarily, simply by sharing with them expected monopoly profits the arrangements will help create. Thus, such agreements are no more 2 ̆ 2 coercive 2 ̆ 2 than ordinary cartel arrangements...|$|R

40|$|The Constitutional Court in National Credit Regulator v Opperman {{confirmed}} the Cape High Court's decision in Opperman v Boonzaaier to declare section 89 (5) (c) of the National Credit Act unconstitutional. Therefore, the forfeiture {{to the state}} of an unregistered creditor provider's right to claim restitution of monies advanced in terms of an unlawful (and void) credit agreement, was held to amount to an arbitrary deprivation of property in contravention of section 25 (1) of the Constitution – the property clause. The provision in effect prohibited courts from deviating from the common law's strict par delictum rule in as far as the effects of unlawful contracts are concerned, the result being that creditors could not retrieve any of the amounts extended to the debtor, despite there being no turpitude or bad faith present. The purpose of this provision was to discourage the concluding of <b>unlawful</b> credit <b>agreements</b> – for instance, agreements concluded by unregistered credit providers – so as to protect consumers against unscrupulous behaviour. Although the broad purposes of the Act are undeniably valid, the Court held that there was no "sufficient reason" for the effects that the Act had in this case, since the credit provider in question was not guilty of the behaviour that the Act tried to combat. In other words, the effects of the Act were over-broad and not proportionate to its stated purposes. This case note comprehensively analyses these decisions in view of interpreting the "confused and confusing" wording of section 89 (5) (c), with a specific focus on the application of the section 25 (1) non-arbitrariness test. Reference is also made to the earlier judgments in the matter of Cherangani Trade and Investment 107 (Edms) Bpk v Mason. The Opperman decisions illustrate well 2 how the non-arbitrariness test should be conducted in consitutional property cases generally but particularly also in the credit context. Of significance {{is the fact that the}} Court for the first time recognised that personal rights sounding in money (an enrichment claim in this instance) should qualify as "property" for constitutional property law purposes. In certain circumstances, therefore, credit regulation may involve deprivation of property such as must satisfy the requirements of the property clause. It is contended that recognising the role of section 25 in the credit context is a positive development that can be explored further. The constitutional provision also calls for lawmakers to draft legislation in such a way that regulatory mechanisms are rational and sufficiently proportionate to its stated goals...|$|R
30|$|The workers {{argued that}} the coal mines had {{continuously}} circumvented their responsibility to purchase social insurance for the workers and violated state laws and regulations. They claimed that since the mines were to be shut down, mine owners should pay the social insurance premiums directly to workers in compensation. Many workers had worked in coal mines in L County for a long period, some over 10  years, and thus their compensation funds would total {{tens of thousands of}} yuan. Coal mine owners opposed such demands because they believed that social insurance premiums had been paid to the workers in cash, and even though the mines were shut down, they were not required to pay compensation funds for workers’ social insurance. What is more, mines did not have the money to pay. For instance, BXL Coal Mine had been in operation for almost 10 years, employing 200 to 400 workers each year. The workers were demanding 6000 yuan in compensation funds for each person/year. This would total twelve million to twenty-four million yuan per year for BXL Coal Mine, which for a mine that had already greatly suffered from the shutdown was unaffordable. Some mine owners stated that they would purchase social insurance for workers, but the precondition was that workers return their social insurance premiums included in their wages in the past. If workers returned these premiums, mine owners would pay the workers’ all social insurance from the past few years. However, this proposal was rejected by the majority of workers. Since mine owners did not meet the workers’ demands, the workers took collective action to pressure the county government for a solution, using three methods. The first method was litigation. Four mine workers engaged lawyers to sue the coal mines on the basis that the labor contracts signed between workers and coal mines were <b>unlawful.</b> The <b>agreements</b> between employers and employees on the payment of social insurance premiums in cash violated state laws. They claimed the coal mines were obliged to purchase social insurance for workers, and they should also pay unpaid premiums when the mines were shut down. The second method was group petition. Since the end of 2013, hundreds of workers had petitioned the county, municipal, and provincial governments dozens of times. For instance, at the end of 2013, hundreds of workers organized a motorcycle team to petition the Y municipal government, which gained wide attention. Petitions to the county government were commonplace and occurred frequently. The township governments located in the coal mining areas also received more than a dozen petitions. The third method was to block the work in the mines. At BXL Coal Mine, the workers’ demands for social insurance premiums were not satisfied after the merger of the mine, and hundreds of workers blocked the mining work for a month. These conflicts exerted significant pressure on L County, resulting in the related bureaus of the county government being, {{in the words of the}} officials, “always at alert and always receiving petitions.” 22 The rectification of coal mines became more difficult to handle, and the improper handling may have encouraged more workers to get involved.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the author has}} {{investigated}} and analysed the treatment of trademark co-existence agreements from a European Union Competition law perspective, i. e. agreements which allow the parties to set rules by which the marks can peacefully co-exist without any likelihood of confusion. Practitioners deal with uncertainty regarding what is lawful to agree upon in a co-existence agreement without the risk of violating competition regulations. By not focusing on co-existence agreements, we miss {{a lot of the}} real commercial world of trademarks and the impact these ‘unknown’ agreements have. The agreements also provide necessary legal certainty for investments, which encourage competition, and it should be considered of public interest that the parties settle their dispute through agreement instead of litigation. Moreover, the advent of the European Union trademark system will probably lead to an increased number of conflicts between trademarks and it is therefore appropriate to hold a wider discussion within the area of co-existence agreements. Trademark co-existence agreements in general consist of a territorial delimitation and/or a product delimitation clause and a non-challenge clause. Due to this, the investigation showed that co-existence agreements could very easily fall within the application of Article 101 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), in case the agreement affects competition in the EU. Article 101 (1) TFEU prohibits agreements with the object or effect of restricting competition and which affects trade between member states. Moreover, the fact that a co-existence agreement {{can be seen as a}} type of licensing agreement may result in Article 5 (1) (c) of the Technology Transfer Regulation to be applicable by analogy to non-challenge clauses. The thesis´ conclusion is that the validity of co-existence agreements depends on how the clauses are written. If the trademark holder is acting within the scope of protection of the trademark right, the restrictive impact of the agreement is usually relatively low since it does not affect the trade of goods. In such case, the agreement merely affects the possibility to promote certain goods by using a specific trademark. On the other hand, if the trademark holder is acting outside the scope of protection of the trademark right, then, the Courts and the Commission could consider the co-existence <b>agreement</b> <b>unlawful.</b> A limited number of cases relating to co-existence agreements have been subject to the European Courts and the Commission. The view on co-existence agreements has varied, ranging between large scepticism and a more liberal approach. Today, the Courts and Commission recognize the positive effects of such agreements, and currently there is a more positive attitude towards the agreements. Even though the co-existence agreement falls within the scope of Article 101 (1) TFEU, case law suggests that the agreement may be exempted if there is serious likelihood of confusion between the trademarks, and the co-existence agreement is a genuine solution to the conflict. As co-existence agreements become increasingly important, there is a growing demand for guidance concerning these agreements. It is recommended that further investigations be undertaken and that guidelines are created or implemented in already existing guidelines with respect to co-existence agreements. Of course it is difficult to provide specific answers to every possible scenario, but the existence of appropriate guidelines would assist companies and lawyers in assessing the compatibility of the co-existence agreement with Article 101 TFEU...|$|R

Nors konkurencija ir yra reguliuojama nacionalinė bei Europos Sąjungos sritis ir valstybė siekia uždrausti neleistinus konkurencinius (kartelinius) susitarimus, jie vis tiek sugeba vešėti. Tokie susitarimai gali būti sudaromi įvairiais būdais iš kurių pasirinktas vienas plačiau analizuojamas darbe – susitarimai sudaromi per viešus skelbimus apie ateities planus rinkoje, tikintis, kad konkurentai prisiderins prie įmonės paskelbusios planus veiksmų, ar viešai atsakys į tokį skelbimą. Dėl minimos priežasties iškyla klausimas ar vieši pranešimai apie įmonės rinkos planus gali būti laikomi konkurenciniu pažeidimu. Šis klausimas darbe nagrinėjamas nacionaliniu Lietuvos, regioniniu Europos Sąjungos lygmeniu. Magistriniame darbe svarbu išanalizuoti konkurencijos apibrėžimą, jos reguliavimą, daromą žalą ekonomikai ir vartotojų teisėms, bei kas yra vienašaliai konkurencijos pažeidimai ir kaip galima identifikuoti kartelinius susitarimus, sudarytus per viešos informacijos, apie rinkos planus atskleidimą. Magistrinio darbo temos pasirinkimą lėmė darbų, teismo praktikos Lietuvoje trūkumas apie vienašalius konkurencijos pažeidimus. Pati konkurencija yra apibrėžiama kaip savaime susiformuojantis reiškinys lemiantis naudą vartotojams ir ekonomikai. Tinkamas jos reglamentavimas užtikrina ūkinės veiklos ir ekonomikos stabilumą, tačiau siekiant tai užtikrinti konkurenciją kontroliuojančios institucijos turi pasirūpinti, kad tokie susitarimai nebūtų sudaromi ir griežtai reguliuoti tai įstatymais. Konkurenciją reguliuojantys įstatymai nenumato atskiro reguliavimo vienašaliams konkurencijos pažeidimams, praktika šiuo klausimu menka, todėl tokius pažeidimus yra labai sunku identifikuoti. Lietuvos teismai praktikos dėl klausimo apie vienašalius konkurencinius pažeidimus viešai atskleidžiant rinkos planus neturi, tačiau tokių susitarimų identifikavimo ir sprendimo būdų galima pasisemti iš Europos Sąjungos Teisingumo teismo ir Europos Komisijos praktikos. Teisingumo teismas savo sprendimuose pažymi, kad leidimas konkurentams adaptuotis prie viešai paskelbtos informacijos apie įmonės rinkos planus ar kainų pasikeitimus, suteikiant tam ilgą laiko tarpą, gali būti laikomas konkurencijos pažeidimu. Vis gi tokios nuostatos negali būti taikomos visiems atvejams, kai kada tokios informacijos pranešimas viešai gali būti efektyviausias būdas informuoti klientus, ypač jei jų yra tūkstančiai, o visų klientų informavimas yra sudėtingas ir brangus. Competition is an {{important}} element in a free market economy. Even though anti-competitive agreements are prohibited under national as well as EU competition law, they still manage to persist. Illegal anti-competitive collusions can be constituted in many ways. This work is focused on specific collusions – collusions made through public announcements, in which one party announces their future market plans hoping that one of the competitors will respond to such announcement either through making their own announcements or through following the same practice based on the information announced. Because of the existence of such collusions, the question is whether public disclosure of companies’ future market plans can be considered as a violation of competition law. In this work, the relevant provisions of the Lithuanian Competition and the European Union will be examined. This work will be focusing on definition of competition; enforcement of antitrust law; what damages illegal collusion does for the economy and consumers rights; most importantly is to define what anticompetitive collusions are and how to identify unilateral breach of competition law made through public announcements about companies’ future market plans. This topic of Master thesis was selected {{due to the lack of}} studies on this matter. It was also selected due to the weak position of Competition Council of the Republic of Lithuania in complaint concerning money withdrawing rate rise from ATM for three largest banks in Lithuania. Competition is defined as process which forms naturally and benefits both consumers and economy. Perfect competition could exist when creative destruction exist in the market as was suggested by J. Schumpeter. It implies that new products would push the old ones out of the market and they would continue through the competition ladder and in doing so it main goal of competition would be reached which is improvement of products and services quality. To ensure a stability in economy proper actions must be introduced by the institution responsible for competition regulations. The institution has to make sure that cartel agreement would not be formed through strict regulation and observance of the competing subjects actions in the same market. Anti-competitive collusions are the worst enemies of the economy and open market and it is regulated by the Lithuanian Law on Competition, the Constitution of Lithuania and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Usually these actions are made through price increase, sharing of the market, limiting of production and exchanging information about future market plans. The European Court of Justice and European Commission applies high standards for such actions. Sometimes even talking about the weather can be regarded as a breach of competition law. Through such arrangements companies try to maximize their income with as little effort as possible. In doing so, they damage economy and consumers rights. It is proven that where competition law is poorly regulated, there is poor economy and higher poverty. Good competition policies insure existence of small businesses and compensative actions for cartel damages. It also helps to attract investors who help economy to grow significantly as they might feel much safer in the market where their right is ensured by the law. Though issuing a claim for an individual alone can be very disproportionate as damages sometime can be only 20 €, so more resources would be spent on litigation than the claim is worth so such actions should be made through group claims and with help of institution responsible for competition. Also there are always exceptions. De minimis notice shows that if <b>unlawful</b> competition <b>agreements</b> can be so small that it does not really impact competition in the market. If commission determines that, it can refuse to investigate a complaint. The Lithuanian Law on Competition includes exemption from punishment if one of the parties admits their guilt before investigation begins and helps within the investigation of the cartel. With these existing exceptions it has to be made sure that impunity wouldn’t be implemented too freely and parties responsible would answer for their breach of law. Laws that regulate competition do not regulate unilateral breaches of competition separately, though we could say that they come from regular competition law as the actions has the same regulation disposition. There is very little case law regarding unilateral breach of competition so it is hard to identify such actions and prove it in the court. Lithuania has no case law regarding the issue at work, our only option is to look at the European Union Court of Justice practice in such matters. Court of Justice has stated that announcing about the future price changes is not a violation in itself, competition institutions has to observe whether competitor has made any changes in his strategy or prices after announcement has been made. Though we cannot assert that every time someone publicly announces about their future prices or other plans in the market that they are trying to arrange anti-competitive collusion. Sometimes such information is a best way to inform clients about changes in the company that affect them directly as well and this is most important for the large companies which have thousands of clients...|$|R
