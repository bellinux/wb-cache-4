I was reading it with such excitement, because this is a real story unfolding, with so many mysteries and quantum leaps and Inception-style traveling between the past and the present. I found it very exciting. So the first time I read it, I was just reading it for enjoyment, really, because it was so well-written and exciting. Once I picked my jaw <b>up</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> I was really keen to get started working on it, because it's such an epic sequence." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a view of a Carey's {{personal}} family album. As the pages open, the camera zooms to one particular photograph, of her young mother facing a wall, with her back turned. As the picture comes into full view, it turns into actual footage. Her mother turns around in anguish, as her own mother begins shouting at her and calling her a disgrace to the family. This {{is due to the fact}} that she is pregnant with the child of a black man, with whom she wants to move out with. As she goes to leave the home, her mother grabs her arm and rips off a [...] "charmbracelet" [...] from her wrist. As she picks it <b>up</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> she tells her mother she hates her and leaves in a taxi. From the clothing and scenery, it is notable that the scenes depicted are happening in the late 1960s, prior to Carey's birth. As the song starts playing, the video focuses on Carey, walking down the street in New York City. As she continues singing and walking down the street, the camera aims to the sky, which is darkened with cloud while light starts to peer through.|$|E

500|$|Metalholic said 'I’m back…” [...] I can’t {{think of}} a more {{appropriate}} way to flow into the second track “Tragic Magic.” [...] Ronnie Radke is most definitely back {{and he is not}} afraid to tell you so.' This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves <b>up</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and do the only thing we can do, try again. [...] Life is what you make of it, if you have lost yourself, it is up to you to find your way again. [...] I got all profound there for a second, it happens.|$|E

Kimmel picked the bullet <b>up</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and murmured, more to himself than to Curts, [...] "It would have been merciful had it killed me."

5000|$|Once {{inside the}} machine, both players {{tried to grab}} as much money and prize {{vouchers}} as they could within a 60-second time limit.

60|$|There was a doubter in Donegal, and {{he would}} not hear of ghosts or sheogues, and there was a house in Donegal that had been haunted as long as man could remember, and {{this is the story of}} how the house got the better of the man. The man came into the house and lighted a fire in the room under the haunted one, and took off his boots and set them On the hearth, and {{stretched}} out his feet and warmed him self. For a time he prospered in his unbelief; but a little while after the night had fallen, and everything had got very dark, one of his boots began to move. It got <b>up</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and gave a kind of slow jump towards the door, and then the other boot did the same, and after that the first boot jumped again. And thereupon it struck the man that an invisible being had got into his boots, and was now going away in them. When the boots reached the door they went up-stairs slowly, and then the man heard them go tramp, tramp round the haunted room over his head. A few minutes passed, and he could hear them again upon the stairs, and after that in the passage outside, and then one of them came in at the door, and the other gave a jump past it and came in too. They jumped along towards him, and then one got up and hit him, and afterwards the other hit him, and then again the first hit him, and so on, until they drove him out of the room, and finally out of the house. In this way he was kicked out by his own boots, and Donegal was avenged upon its doubter. It is not recorded whether the invisible being was a ghost or one of the Sidhe, but the fantastic nature of the vengeance is like the work of the Sidhe who live in the heart of fantasy.|$|E

Dewhurst died before the character of Marilla could be written out and her final scenes were picked <b>up</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> editing-room <b>floor</b> and pieced together for her death scene. During 1989 and 1990, she appeared in a supporting role on the television series Murphy Brown playing the feisty mother of Candice Bergen's title character; this role earned her two Emmy Awards, the second being awarded posthumously. Dewhurst won a total of two Tony Awards and four Emmy Awards for her stage and television work.|$|R

On February 13, 1958, Veranis knocked out Silby Ford for a mandatory eight count in the fifth round. He broke Ford's jaw and dislodged several teeth that sent him down. Ford was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital following Anthony's victory.

On March 17, 1958 he fought his last professional match against Joe Devlin.|$|R

2500|$|Although what {{first comes}} to mind as the common domain of {{jellyfish}} is living well <b>up</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ocean <b>floor</b> in <b>the</b> plankton, a few species of jellyfish are {{closely associated with the}} bottom for much of their lives (that is, they can be considered benthic).

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a nonlinear mathematical model for predicting stresses in a submarine pipeline {{as it is}} picked <b>up</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ocean <b>floor</b> by barge davits for purposes such as repairs and tie-ins. Large deflections are assumed and the pipeline is modeled {{as a series of}} finite beam segments from the ocean bottom on up. Using an initial-value approach, a pipeline configuration satisfying known boundary conditions is determined by an iterative technique, in which bottom conditions are identified by considering the part of the pipeline resting on the sea bed as a semi-infinite tensioned beam on an elastic foundation. The effects of material nonlinearity are included and both Ramberg-Osgood and Hutchinson formulations are considered. With the pipe model suggested, any given pickup procedure can be analyzed or a reliable procedure can be designed based on given constraints and any desired improvement in the final configuration and/or stress levels may be achieved by a variation of the parameters involved. A practical example is examined to illustrate the applicability of the model in either assessing or developing a pickup procedure...|$|R

The video premiered on 4Music and Channel 4 on 29 July 2009. The video begins with Martin waking up in his house. Once he sees that a woman is being held hostage by a giant squirrel, he turns into a superhero and attempts to save her. Along the way, Martin faces attacks from the squirrel and a giant fish in the ocean. When Martin finally gets to the squirrel's home, he rescues the lady by drawing a nut-shaped bomb that blows the squirrel up. The two then fly away and begin to kiss. At the end of the song, the animation stops and Martin gets <b>up</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> chalk-colored <b>floor</b> in real speed and walks away.
