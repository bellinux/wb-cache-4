Kantian constitutivism tackles both worries simultaneously by claiming that practical norms are constitutive principles of practical reason.

To will well, and thus to have practical knowledge (i. e., knowledge of what is good), the content of one’s will needs {{to conform to the}} formal presuppositions of practical knowledge. Practical norms are thus constitutive of practical knowledge.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{understand}} general <b>universality</b> <b>principles</b> for random network models whose component sizes in the critical regime lie in the multiplicative coalescent universality class but with heavy tails resulting in hubs. For the multiplicative coalescent in this regime, limit (random) metric spaces via appropriate tilts of inhomogeneous continuum random trees were derived by Bhamidi et al. (2015). In this paper we derive sufficient uniform asymptotic negligibility conditions for general network models to satisfy in the barely subcritical regime such that, if the model can be appropriately coupled to a multiplicative coalescent as one transitions from the barely subcritical regime through the critical scaling window, then the maximal components belong to the same universality class as in Bhamidi et al. (2015). As a canonical example, we study critical percolation on configuration models with heavy-tailed degrees. Of independent interest, we derive refined asymptotics for various susceptibility functions and maximal diameter in the barely subcritical regime. These estimates, coupled with the universality result, allow us to derive the asymptotic metric structure of the large components through the critical scaling window for percolation.

40|$|We {{argue that}} {{compatibility}} with elementary particle physics requires gravitational theories with torsion {{to be unable}} to distinguish between orbital angular momentum and spin. An important consequence of this principle is that spinless particles must move along autoparallel trajectories, not along geodesics. 1. <b>Universality</b> <b>principles</b> provide us with important guidelines for constructing candidates for fundamental theories which {{have a chance of}} being true. For example, an essential property of Maxwell’s theory is that electromagnetic interactions depend only on the charge of a particle, not on the various physical origins of charge. The charge of an ion is composed of electron and nuclear charges, the latter of proton charges, these in turn of quark charges, which eventually me turn out to arise from further charged substructures. The motion of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field does not depend on these details, which are subject to change by future discoveries. An atom moves like a neutral point particle, in spite of the completely different origins of electron and proton charges, the exact neutrality of an atom being the very basis for the electrostatic stability of large gravitational bodies (and thus for the existence of theoretical physics). The irrelevance of the physical origin of the “charge ” of gravitational interactions, the mass, led Einstein to the discovery of a geometric theory of these interactions.

40|$|The {{system of}} {{strongly}} interacting particles is discussed, with electromagnetism, weak interactions, and gravitation considered as perturbations. The electric current jα, the weak current Jα, and the gravitational tensor θαβ are all well-defined operators, with finite matrix elements obeying dispersion relations. To {{the extent that}} the dispersion relations for matrix elements of these operators between the vacuum and other states are highly convergent and dominated by contributions from intermediate one-meson states, we have relations like the Goldberger-Treiman formula and <b>universality</b> <b>principles</b> like that of Sakurai according to which the ρ meson is coupled approximately to the isotopic spin. Homogeneous linear dispersion relations, even without subtractions, do not suffice to fix the scale of these matrix elements; in particular, for the nonconserved currents, the renormalization factors cannot be calculated, and the universality of strength of the weak interactions is undefined. More information than just the dispersion relations must be supplied, for example, by field-theoretic models; we consider, in fact, the equal-time commutation relations of the various parts of j 4 and J 4. These nonlinear relations define an algebraic system (or a group) that underlies the structure of baryons and mesons. It is suggested that the group is in fact U(3) ×U(3), exemplified by the symmetrical Sakata model. The Hamiltonian density θ 44 is not completely invariant under the group; the noninvariant part transforms according to a particular representation of the group; it is possible that this information also is given correctly by the symmetrical Sakata model. Various exact relations among form factors follow from the algebraic structure. In addition, it may be worthwhile to consider the approximate situation in which the strangeness-changing vector currents are conserved and the Hamiltonian is invariant under U(3); we refer to this limiting case as "unitary symmetry. " In the limit, the baryons and mesons form degenerate supermultiplets, which break up into isotopic multiplets when the symmetry-breaking term in the Hamiltonian is "turned on. " The mesons are expected to form unitary singlets and octets; each octet breaks up into a triplet, a singlet, and a pair of strange doublets. The known pseudoscalar and vector mesons fit this pattern if there exists also an isotopic singlet pseudoscalar meson χ 0. If we consider unitary symmetry in the abstract rather than in connection with a field theory, then we find, as an attractive alternative to the Sakata model, the scheme of Ne'eman and Gell-Mann, which we call the "eightfold way"; the baryons N, Λ, Σ, and Ξ form an octet, like the vector and pseudoscalar meson octets, in the limit of unitary symmetry. Although the violations of unitary symmetry must be quite large, there is some hope of relating certain violations to others. As an example of the methods advocated, we present a rough calculation of the rate of K+→μ++ν in terms of that of π+→μ++ν...|$|R
