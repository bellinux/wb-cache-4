This kind of <b>unidirectional</b> <b>transmission</b> belongs to the extraordinary optical transmission assisted by the surface plasmon polariton (SPP). The SPP wave comes through the multi-reflection process and finally transforms into the transmission wave. The difference of amplitude transmissivities and reflectivities at different surfaces in opposite incident directions results in the <b>unidirectional</b> <b>transmission.</b> A division method is proposed to calculate the parameters of subwavelength gratings with asymmetric surfaces...|$|E

40|$|We propose in {{this work}} combing a {{uniaxial}} crystal slab with a one-dimensional grating to realize <b>unidirectional</b> <b>transmission</b> (UDT). The physical mechanism for the UDT is attributed to polarization conversion with uniaxial crystal slab and excitation of magnetic polaritons (MPs) or surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) in the grating region. Numerical simulations were performed by taking hexagonal boron nitride as the uniaxial crystal. The results reveal that UDT can be achieved for both TE and TM waves in the mid-infrared and the optical regions if the grating material is respectively selected as silicon carbide (SiC) and silver (Ag) with properly chosen values of the structure’s geometric parameters.

40|$|Background: This study {{examined}} the volatility spillover effects between the stock markets of Asian countries, i. e., Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, China, Japan, and Hong Kong. Methods: The daily data was considered from the period 4 January 1999 to 1 January 2014, consisting five trading days from Monday to Friday.

These static magnetoelectric (ME) effects are of enormous interest: The ability {{to read and write}} a magnetic state current-free by an electric voltage would provide a huge technological advantage. Dynamic or optical ME effects are equally interesting because they give rise to unidirectional light propagation as recently observed in low-temperature multiferroics. This phenomenon, if realized at room temperature, would allow the development of optical diodes which transmit unpolarized light in one, but not in the opposite direction. Here, we report strong <b>unidirectional</b> <b>transmission</b> in the room-temperature multiferroic BiFeO$_ 3 $ over the gigahertz [...] terahertz frequency range.
