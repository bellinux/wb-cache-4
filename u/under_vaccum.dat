It was fortified 0. 25 g of plasma with pesticides and blended with 1 g each C 18 and Na 2 SO 4. The homogenized matter {{was transferred to}} a SPE cartridge, which contained 1 g of activated florisil with 5 mL acetonitrile. The analites were eluted <b>under</b> <b>vaccum</b> with 15 mL acetonitrile, the extract was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.

40|$|P>In this study, {{physical}} characteristics of goat milk powder produced {{with the addition}} of soy lecithin at levels of 0 (control), 0. 4, 0. 8 and 1. 0 g lecithin/ 100 g of total solids in concentrated milk before the spray drying process were investigated. Goat milk was pasteurised, concentrated at 40 % of total solids, spray dried and packed in plastic bags <b>under</b> <b>vaccum</b> conditions. Lecithin addition decreased the wetting time of milk powders, although no influence was observed on dispersibility, water sorption, water activity and particle size distribution of the powders. Powders with higher levels of lecithin showed significantly lower brightness, with a greater intensity of yellow colour. It was concluded that lecithin addition before spray drying process at the minimal proportion in concentrated milk of 0. 4 g lecithin/ 100 g of total solids in concentrated milk is useful for achieving more rapid wetting time of goat milk powder.

40|$|A simple {{reversed}} phase HPLC {{method has}} been developed for the determination of polyhexamethylene biguanide hydrochloride in multipurpose solution for hydrophilic contact lenses. The mobile phase was acetonitrile 1 % (v/v) ammonium acetate 20 mM in water as 16 : 84 (v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml / min. Polyhexamethylene biguanide hydrochloride was detected by UV absorption at 235 nm. The pH was kept at 4. 0 using glacial acetic acid. The method of Yiping et al has been slightly modified as needed. The quantity detected was 2 µg/ml so it was carried out using a preconcentration method <b>under</b> <b>vaccum.</b> From the chromatogram, {{it was observed that}} a distinct peak appeared at retention time 5. 883 min for polyhexamethylene biguanide hydrochloride. The recovery of drug was found to be 99. 38 % and the method was simple, rapid and suitable for the assay of drug in multipurpose solution for hydrophilic contact lenses and for carrying out stability as per ICH guidelines to assess the stability of polyhexamethylene biguanide hydrochloride in multipurpose solution...|$|E
40|$|Rat brain Na,K-ATPase {{partially}} purified by SDS from synaptic plasma membranes (SPM) was immobilized by adsorption on nitrocellulose (NC), {{polyvinylidene fluoride}} (PVDF) and glass fiber (GF) membranes. Partial SDS solubilization increased the enzyme activity by 40 %. With {{regard to the}} preservation of the enzyme activity, nitrocellulose was shown to be the optimal support for the immobilization. The enzyme showed the highest percentage activity (14 %) after 30 min of SPM adsorption, at 20 °C <b>under</b> the <b>vaccum,</b> with 25 mg of proteins per NC disc filter. In addition, adsorption on NC stabilizes the Na,K-ATPase, since the activity was substantial 72 h after adsorption at 20 °C. After adsorption, the sensitivity of the enzyme to HgCl 2 and CdCll 2 inhibition was higher. The results show that immobilized Na,K-ATPase SPM {{can be used as a}} practical model for the detection of metal ions in different samples...|$|R
40|$|Directional intermolecular {{forces are}} {{considered}} promising candidates {{to study and}} prepare networks that could undergo phase transitions through a thermally-induced change of molecular conformation which in turn leads to a variation of intermolecular interactions. The intermolecular force that will be exploited is the H-bond due to their intermolecular interaction strength and geometry which can be controlled by the number and arrangement of available H-bonding donor and acceptor moieties. The 2 D self-organization of a conjugated molecule bearing terminal 2, 6 - di(acylamino) pyridine moieties [1], which are well known to form H-bonds, on a Ag(111) surface <b>under</b> ultrahigh <b>vaccum</b> has been studied by STM. For sample prepared at room temperature, the molecules arrange in a hexagonal network (Figure 1 a-b). Combining the information derived from STM and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) measurements, a commensurate superstructure is found with the molecules arranged in a rhombic unit cell. In Figure 1 e the structural model for this ad-layer is shown while the pores visible in the STM image in Figure 2 b are denoted by back circles and the black arrow indicates a high symmetry direction of the Ag substrate...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This article {{explores the}} {{formation}} of graphene layers on 3 C-SiC(111) epilayers grown on silicon substrates using thermal annealing <b>under</b> Ultra High <b>Vaccum</b> (UHV) environment. The formation of graphene is demonstrated by use of near field microscopy (STM and AFM) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The evolution of the surface stoichiometry of the 3 C-SiC(111) pseudo substrates during the graphitization process {{is similar to that}} of the commonly used Si terminated α-SiC bulk substrates, starting from a Si rich to the C rich surface characterized by a () ° × 30 R 3636 diffraction pattern. Graphitization process leads to a strong modification of the surface at a microscopic scale which is compared to that reported in case of 6 H-SiC substrates. XPS spectra reveal the presence of typical C-C bonds related to a graphitic arrangement. Its high level of ordering is attested by the observation both of (6 × 6) SiC and (1 × 1) graphene surface reconstructions by STM. These results demonstrate {{the formation of}} graphene on 3 C-SiC(111) /Si pseudo substrates. They open perspectives for developing novel C/SiC/Si heterostructures and put light on the ability of 3 C-SiC/Si templates to become a low cost alternative of onerous α-SiC substrates...|$|R

The fruits were washed in water, peeled, manually cut in cubes of 3 x 3 cm and conditioned in packages of polyethylene terphthalate (PET) tray Neoform, transparent plastic glass with cover (250 ml), and plastic bag (25 mm) <b>under</b> <b>vaccum.</b> After that, {{they were in the}} EMBRARAD company, with the doses T 1 (control), T 2 (0, 1 kGy), T 3 (0, 2 kGy), T 4 (0, 3 kGy), T 5 (0, 4 kGy) and T 6 (0, 5 kGy), and stored under 5 o C and 85 % RM. Every 2 days of storage, the fruits were evaluated for the incidence of coliforms, mesophiles and psychrophiles microorganisms. From the obtained results is it verified {{at the end of a}} 10 -day period, the fruits with 0, 4 and 0, 5 kGy doses and packages of polyethylene terphthalate (PET) tray Neoform, transparent plastic glass with cover (250 ml), presented the smallest mesophile and psychrophile rates, while the fruits control presented the largest mesophile and psychrophile rates, being considered inappropriate for consuption from the fifith day of storage.

40|$|In {{many years}} ago, Isgur and Llewellyn Smith {{addressed}} that PQCD is inapplicable to exclusive processes, {{such as the}} pion form factor. The main {{problem is that the}} asymptotic of PQCD is only about one fourth of the experimental value. We reexamine this PQCD deep problem. By including NLO power corrections to the pion form factor, we may arrive at a perturbative explanation for the data. The key realization {{is that we need to}} interprete that the strong interaction coupling constant involved in the PQCD result should be taken as an effective coupling constant <b>under</b> nonperturbative QCD <b>vaccum.</b> This implies that one can equally identify the relevant scale for the effective coupling constant as the factorization scale about 1 GeV. We also find that the average momentum fraction variable locates about 0. 5, which is in favor of the asymptotic pion wave function. By employing photon-pion form factor with NLO power corrections to factorize out the nonperturbative effects involved in the effective coupling constant, we can extract an effective running coupling constant, which represents an effective coupling involving in the hard scattering subprocesses. The difference between the effective running coupling constant and the usual perturbative running coupling constant (Λ_QCD= 0. 3 GeV) is very small for Q^ 2 > 1 GeV^ 2. The effective running coupling constant α_s/π is smaller than 0. 2 for Q^ 2 > 1 GeV^ 2. This directly showes that PQCD is applicable to exclusive processes at energy Q^ 2 > 1 GeV^ 2. In summary, with NLO power corrections, PQCD can completely explain the Q^ 2 spectrum of pion form factor. Comment: 8 pages, 4 figures, a typo corrected, 2 references adde...|$|R
