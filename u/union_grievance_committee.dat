50|$|After {{working at}} Winston-Salem for six weeks, the plaintiffs were {{alternately}} laid off and recalled several times. Some of the laid off truckers were {{stripped of their}} special seniority rights. The plaintiffs filed a <b>grievance</b> with the <b>union,</b> alleging that McLean had breached {{the collective bargaining agreement}} by giving inactive employees preference over them. The <b>grievance</b> <b>committee</b> ordered McLean to recall the plaintiffs and lay off the inactive drivers who had been recalled, and to recognize plaintiffs’ special seniority rights until the inactive employees were recalled properly. McLean obeyed the order of the <b>grievance</b> <b>committee</b> at first, but then recalled the inactive employees, causing them to gain seniority status over the plaintiffs. In the next round of layoffs, this meant that the plaintiffs were laid off first. Plaintiffs then filed another <b>grievance</b> with the <b>union,</b> alleging that McLean’s actions were intended to circumvent the <b>grievance</b> <b>committee’s</b> initial order. But the <b>grievance</b> <b>committee</b> held that McLean had acted legitimately. This pattern of temporary layoffs and recalls continued, prompting plaintiffs to file another <b>grievance,</b> but the <b>Union</b> did not refer the third grievance to a <b>grievance</b> <b>committee,</b> instead ruling that the relevant issues had already been decided.|$|R

50|$|In 2006, Sherman paid Yalincak a $50,000 refund {{during the}} {{grievance}} process, {{and the former}} client tried to drop his charges, but the agency wouldn't allow it. The panel then started investigating whether or not Sherman had acted improperly by making a payment to someone who brought accusations against him to the state agency. Sherman said the payment {{had nothing to do}} with the complaint to the agency but was made in exchange for Yalincak's agreement not to file a lawsuit against him. In September 2006, a regional panel of the Statewide <b>Grievance</b> <b>Committee</b> issued a finding of probable cause against Sherman. In February 2007, Yalincak also filed a federal lawsuit against Sherman and his partners at the law firm of Sherman, Zichichi, & Hickey, LLC. In May 2007, Sherman agreed to reduced charges that he violated two rules of professional conduct and was reprimanded by the Statewide <b>Grievance</b> <b>Committee.</b> In October 2007, Sherman also reached two confidential settlements with the complainant.
