5|$|Cal Neva Resort & Casino, {{previously}} {{known as}} the Calneva Resort, Cal-Neva Lodge, is a resort and casino straddling the border between Nevada and California {{on the shores of}} Lake Tahoe. The original building was constructed in 1926, and became famous when the national media picked <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about actress Clara Bow cancelling checks she owed to the Cal Neva worth $13,000 in 1930. After a fire, the building burnt down in 1937 and was rebuilt over the course of 30 days. In 1960, entertainer Frank Sinatra purchased the Resort alongside Dean Martin and Chicago mobster Sam Giancana.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea behind}} the episode came from the {{financial}} crisis of Northern Rock in late 2007; the producers wanted to set <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about a bank collapse so severe it could result in an economic collapse. The episode was filmed in May 2008, with a lot taking place in London's Blue Fin building. About six million viewers saw the episode from both BBC One and Three broadcasts; the BBC One ratings were steady despite heavy competition from I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here! on ITV1. Critical reactions towards the episode were positive for including a change in plot.|$|E

5|$|The news of FreeSpace 2 {{being in}} {{development}} was confirmed in a chat on November 6, 1998. FreeSpace 2 {{was developed in}} less than one year. The Volition team revealed they had written <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> and will be targeting high-end hardware with dogfights for {{a greater number of}} ships and even larger and more deadly capital ships. The team set themselves the goals of setting new standards for both single-player and multiplayer space combat simulations, and started to modify the FreeSpace game engine for FreeSpace 2. This team was the same team which had worked on Descent: FreeSpace, plus several new members. In order to flesh out the story, Volition hired Jason Scott as a full-time writer before work even started. The linear mission structure was adopted as it was decided it would help the immersion factor of the story greatly. As the relations between the Terrans and Vasudans dominated the first game, it was decided to scale the focus down to a personal level with Admiral Bosch and his decisions to rebel. Scott's close work with the designers, and co-ordination of the voice recording process helped to tightly integrate the story into the missions, giving a more sophisticated feel to the story.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} alleged that Nuvolari was {{involved}} in a race-fixing scandal at the Tripoli Grand Prix. The story is that he conspired with Achille Varzi and Baconin Borzacchini to fix the race in order to profit from the Libyan state lottery, in which 30 tickets were drawn before the race—one for each starter—and the holder of the ticket corresponding to the victorious driver won 7.5 million lire. Others say the allegation was unfounded and that it originated with Alfred Neubauer, the Mercedes-Benz team manager at the time, who was well known as a raconteur with a penchant for spicing <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>story.</b> Neubauer's version does not altogether hold true with documented records of events, which indicate that Nuvolari, Varzi, and Borzacchini agreed to pool the prize money should one of them win.|$|E

25|$|After {{the merger}} between Square and Enix in 2003, many rookie staff members {{had to be}} trained and there were more new {{platforms}} to develop for {{with the release of}} the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable. Toriyama decided to assemble and direct a team of scenario writers and joined various game projects. He later collaborated with Final Fantasy X main programmer Koji Sugimoto and supervisor Yoshinori Kitase to create a Final Fantasy VII tech demo for the PlayStation 3. Development of this took around 6 weeks. During the first year after the development start of Final Fantasy XIII in April 2004, Toriyama thought <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> premised on the Fabula Nova Crystallis mythology created by Kazushige Nojima. In March 2006, when the structural part of the narrative started to come together and lead scenario writer Daisuke Watanabe joined the team, Toriyama showed him a rough outline of what he had written and asked him to flesh out the story and to correct how everything would connect.|$|E
25|$|Another trope of operas is the deus ex machina, {{in which}} the protagonist is saved {{at the last minute}} by divine intervention. This is a useful {{technique}} to quickly wrap <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> and make a happy ending, and has been used in drama many times. In Mahagonny, though there are no supernatural occurrences for most of the opera, there is in fact a deus ex machina; God himself comes to Mahagonny right before Jimmy is executed. The typical opera would have God solving all the problems {{just in time for the}} end of the opera, but Mahagonnys god does not. He does not even acknowledge that Jimmy is tied up and ready to be killed, but at least tries to fix the moral problems in Mahagonny. He tries to convince them to give up their degraded way of life, but the residents all refuse the offer. God then tells them literally to go to hell, but the people are not even offended; they proclaim that they already are in hell so that is no punishment. After fixing nothing, God then lets Jimmy have his say. Jimmy realizes that money did not buy him happiness or freedom, and he has learned his lesson. However, God does not spare him even then, and Jimmy is executed off-stage.|$|E

There has been much conjecture and ad hominem attacks from some historians about Weems and his story, but none have proven or disproven the story.|$|E

500|$|At the Byrnes' home, Greg meets Pam's {{overbearing}} father Jack, mother Dina {{and their}} cat, Jinxy, a seal-point peke-faced Himalayan with an all-black tail. Jack takes an instant dislike to Greg and openly criticizes {{him for his}} choice of career as a male nurse and whatever else he sees as a difference between Greg and the Byrnes family. Greg tries to impress Jack, but his efforts fail after he recites the lyrics to [...] "Day by Day" [...] from [...] "Godspell" [...] when asked to say grace at dinner (as he is Jewish), making <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> of milking a cat, finding out Pam was engaged and (while popping the cork of a bottle of champagne) accidentally breaking an urn holding the remains of Jack's mother which Jinx then urinates in. Greg becomes even more uncomfortable after he receives an impromptu lie detector test from Jack and later learns from Pam that her father is a retired CIA counterintelligence officer.|$|E
500|$|The {{first of}} twenty-eight books in Blyton's Old Thatch series, The Talking Teapot and Other Tales, was {{published}} in 1934, {{the same year as}} the first book in her Brer Rabbit series, Brer Rabbit Retold; (note that Brer Rabbit originally featured in Uncle Remus stories by Joel Chandler Harris), her first serial story and first full-length book, Adventures of the Wishing-Chair, followed in 1937. The Enchanted Wood, the first book in the Faraway Tree series, published in 1939, is about a magic tree inspired by the Norse mythology that had fascinated Blyton as a child. According to Blyton's daughter Gillian the inspiration for the magic tree came from [...] "thinking <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> one day and suddenly she was walking in the enchanted wood and found the tree. In her imagination she climbed up through the branches and met Moon-Face, Silky, the Saucepan Man {{and the rest of the}} characters. She had all she needed." [...] As in the Wishing-Chair series, these fantasy books typically involve children being transported into a magical world in which they meet fairies, goblins, elves, pixies and other mythological creatures.|$|E
500|$|Forbes made {{a single}} {{appearance}} in the sixth season, in the episode [...] "". In {{the plot of the}} episode, a transporter accidentally turns Ro and others, into children. There was some consideration after the episode about whether or not to keep Ro as a child, as her return to adulthood was never shown on screen. Taylor said that the change would have been [...] "too drastic for us", and the idea was abandoned. Her final appearance, in the penultimate episode of the series, [...] "", had been considered a long shot by the producers. After the failure to agree to her appearances on , Forbes' agent had warned them to stay away from her. A week prior to filming, there was no story created for the episode other than the idea it would follow on from the Deep Space Nine episode [...] "", and no agreement had been reached with Forbes to appear.

500|$|Blair Marnell of Crave Online {{noted that}} [...] "Night Terrors" [...] was {{reminiscent}} of the second series episode [...] "Fear Her", but said that this episode [...] "fared {{a little bit better}} because it didn't rely on Jamie Oram's George to be anything more than a scared little boy". She also praised Matt Smith's performance and Arthur Darvill's Rory, who was [...] "quickly becoming one of the funniest companions of the new Doctor Who", though she commented that Amy's transformation into a doll was [...] "kind of glossed over within the story itself" [...] and [...] "there was never any doubt that it would be reversed". Overall, the episode was given a 7 out of 10 rating. Sam McPherson, writing for Zap2it, called [...] "Night Terrors" [...] the [...] "worst episode of series 6 so far" [...] that was an [...] "incoherent mess of an episode that was utterly unenjoyable" [...] and gave it an overall grade of a C+. He criticised the idea to follow <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> arc-heavy episode with a standalone one, as he felt it [...] "served as a speed bump for the forward momentum started in [...] "A Good Man Goes to War" [...] and continued through [...] "Let's Kill Hitler". He thought that its [...] "biggest flaw" [...] was that George was sidelined in favour of Alex, which missed an opportunity to make it a story [...] "about little boys overcoming fear and fighting off the monsters in their closets".

He concluded [...] "with the current glut of Tolkien-inspired games focusing directly on the brutal, tragic stories of The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit offers <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> that's less dire and more of an enjoyable romp.

2500|$|Producer Harris Salomon wasn't {{aware of}} Rosenblat's hoax {{when he started}} working on his movie of the Rosenblat story, but still intends to produce it, as he had always planned a [...] "loose and fictionalised adaptation" [...] and [...] "the story retains its power to grip audiences worldwide." [...] He had been working with Rosenblat over a six-year period as the {{original}} feature film was being developed. According to Salomon, the script for the feature was completed in October 2009 with casting to commence by Celestia Fox in London. Producers Abi Sirokh, Gabor Koltai, Lew Rywin and Thierry Potok contributed to the project.

2500|$|George Hutchinson was an {{unemployed}} labourer. On 12 November 1888, {{he made a}} formal statement to the London police {{that in the early}} hours of 9 November 1888, Mary Jane Kelly approached him in the street and asked him for money. He stated that he had then followed her and another man of conspicuous appearance to her room, and had watched the room for about three-quarters of an hour without seeing either leave. He gave a very detailed description of the man, claiming he was [...] "of Jewish appearance", despite the darkness of that night. The accuracy of Hutchinson's statement was disputed among the senior police. Inspector Frederick Abberline, after interviewing Hutchinson, believed that Hutchinson's account was truthful. However, Robert Anderson, head of the CID, later claimed that the only witness who got a good look at the killer was Jewish. Hutchinson was not a Jew, and thus not that witness. Hutchinson's statement was made on the day that Mary Kelly's inquest was held, and he was not called to testify. Some modern scholars have suggested that Hutchinson was the Ripper himself, trying to confuse the police with a false description, but others suggest he may have just been an attention seeker who made <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> he hoped to sell to the press.|$|E
