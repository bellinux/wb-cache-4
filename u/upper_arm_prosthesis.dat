40|$|Background: After {{an upper}} limb {{amputation}} a prosthesis {{is often used}} to restore the functionality. However, the frequency of prostheses use is generally low. Movement kinematics of prostheses use might suggest origins of this low use. The aim {{of this study was to}} reveal movement patterns of prostheses during basic goal-directed actions in upper limb prosthetic users and to compare this with existing knowledge of able-bodied performance during these actions. Methods: Movements from six users of upper extremity prostheses were analyzed, three participants with a hybrid <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> <b>prosthesis,</b> and three participants with a myoelectric forearm prosthesis. Two grasping tasks and a reciprocal pointing task were investigated during a single lab session. Analyses were carried out on the kinematics of the tasks. Findings: When grasping, movements with both prostheses showed asymmetric velocity profiles of the reach and had a plateau in the aperture profiles. Reach and grasp were decoupled. Kinematics with the prostheses differed in that the use of upper arm prostheses required more time to execute the movements, while the movements were less smooth, more asymmetric, and showed more decoupling between reach and grasp. The pointing task showed for both prostheses less harmonic movements with higher task difficulty. Interpretation: Characterizing prosthetic movement patterns revealed specific features of prosthetic performance. Developments in technology and rehabilitation should focus on these issues to improve prosthetic use, in particular on improving motor characteristics and the control of the elbow, and learning to coordinate the reach and the grasp component in prehension.

The present cross-sectional study was conducted among 1281 children of West Bengal, India (boys 619, girls 662) aged 5 - 12 years and selected using a stratified random sampling method. Anthropometric measurements of height, weight, MUAC and triceps skinfold (TSF) were recorded.

40|$|The {{recently}} prevailing {{trend in}} our country is {{the adoption of the}} girth of <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> as a measure of the nutritional condition. The reason is that the girth of <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> exactly indicates the state of growth of <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> having plenty of fat, muscles and blood of which the girth of <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> is consisted. The quantity of subcutaneous fat is usually resumed by its thickness, but Oeder's method is not very exact in measuring it. Electromyography has given us more satisfactory results. By this method we measured the thickness of subcutaneous fat tissues on <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> and abdomen, and got the correlation between the thickness and the girth of <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> or Vervaeck index; we examined the correlation between the girth of <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> and the Schlomka index, the strength of back muscles and the gripe strength, which indicate musclar growth. For this purpose, the measurements of standing hight, weight, girth of chest and sitting hight of 24 male students were carried out. As a result we observed that the girth of <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> is not correlated with the thickness of subcutaneous fat but with musclar growth only, and also that the thickness of subcutaneous fat tissues on <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> and abdomen is not correlated with weight and Vervaeck index at all, and that the difference between the thickness of subcutaneous fat tissues on <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> and that on abdomen is negatively correlated to the muscle growth. Consequently, supposing that subcutaneous fat is exactly parallel with the total quantity of body fat, and also from the view point that quantity of body fat is not negligible for the determination of nutritional condition, the girthof <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> and Vervaeck index should not be adopted as a measure of nutritional condition. In order to obtain the final conclusion of this, however, we have to ascertain if the subcutaneous quantity is in parallel with total quantity of body fat, and the subcutaneous fat quantity is presumed by its thickness...|$|R

40|$|Background Obesity is a {{worldwide}} problem and {{is associated with}} increased risk of metabolic syndrome. Nutritional status in children has traditionally been determined by body mass index (BMI) scores, but with limitations. <b>Upper</b> <b>arm</b> circumference measurement {{may be a better}} predictor of energy, protein, and fat storage, as well as a simpler method for screening overweight and obesity in children. Objective To determine the diagnostic value of <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> circumference compared to BMI for detecting overweight and obesity in children aged 6 - 7 years. Methods This diagnostic study with a cross-sectional design was performed from September to October 2015 at 16 primary schools in Palembang, Indonesia. We measured the heights, weights, and <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> circumferences, and calculated BMIs of 2, 258 children. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to find an optimal <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> circumference cut-off point to detect overweight and obesity. Diagnostic value was calculated by using a 2 x 2 table analysis. Results The prevalences of overweight and obesity were 5. 8 % and 11. 7 %, respectively. The optimal <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> circumference cut-off points for detecting overweight in children aged 6 - 7 years was 185 mm (sensitivity 88. 1 % and specificity 78. 3 %), and for obesity was 195 mm (sensitivity 90. 15 % and specificity 86. 65 %). <b>Upper</b> <b>arm</b> circumference had a strong correlation with BMI.

40|$|Age {{and heart}} failure is {{associated}} with impaired arm venous function, indicating a negative effect of both age and heart failure on arm venous compliance. Positive associations have been found between cardiopulmonary fitness and leg venous compliance; however, diverging results are reported {{with regards to the}} association between arm venous compliance and cardiopulmonary fitness. Additionally, the role of blood volume in the determination of venous compliance is unknown. The overall aim of the present thesis was to investigate the effect of age, coronary artery disease, and blood volume on <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> venous compliance. The present thesis compared healthy individuals (aged 20 - 69 years), stable coronary artery disease patients and overweight and obese individuals with similar VO 2 max/peak to examine whether age, coronary artery disease or overweight per se has an effect on <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> venous compliance. No difference was found in <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> venous compliance normalized to blood volume, indicating that total blood volume and VO 2 max/peak might be of importance for <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> venous compliance. The present thesis also examined the effect of six weeks of exercise training with different durations and intensities on <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> venous compliance. No change in <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> venous compliance was found, despite increased VO 2 max after high intensity interval training. However, no change was found in total blood volume in either group. These results indicate that <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> venous compliance will remain unchanged after high intensity interval training which increases VO 2 max, as long as blood volume is unchanged. In conclusion, this thesis shows that total blood volume and VO 2 max/peak might be of importance for <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> venous compliance in ageing individuals (20 - 69 years of age), in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD), and in overweight and obese individuals. Additionally, the present thesis indicates that <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> venous compliance will remain unchanged after high intensity interval training, which increases VO 2 max in overweight and obese participants as long as blood volume is unchanged...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Severe arm {{disability}} {{is considered}} to indicate poor potential to recover arm function. OBJECTIVE: Determine if stroke survivors with severe <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> disability can achieve a clinically important change in arm function on discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. METHODS: 618 stroke survivors from 16 inpatient rehabilitation units were assessed on admission and discharge using the Motor Assessment Scale Item 6 <b>Upper</b> <b>Arm</b> Function (MAS 6). Admission scores defined participants with severe (MAS 6 = 2) and mild/moderate (MAS 6 > 2) <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> disability. A clinically important change was evaluated according to: 1) statistical significance; 2) minimal clinical importance difference (MCID); and 3) shift in disability status i. e., severe to mild/moderate. Achievers of a MCID and shift were compared to non-achievers. RESULTS: Stroke survivors with severe <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> disability (n = 226) demonstrated a significant improvement in arm function (p < 0. 001) at discharge. A MCID was achieved by 68 % (n = 155) and a shift from severe to mild/moderate <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> disability on discharge by 45 % (n = 102) of participants.

40|$|Treatment {{of failed}} native {{arteriovenous}} fistulae for hemodialysis by interventional radiology. BackgroundWe studied the feasibility, technical problems, safety, {{and effectiveness of}} percutaneous declotting of thrombosed native arteriovenous fistulae for hemodialysis. MethodsBetween 1992 and 1998, 93 declotting procedures were performed in 73 consecutive upper limb native fistulae (forearm 56 and <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> 17), and 162 procedures were performed in 78 prosthetic grafts using manual catheter-directed thromboaspiration, with or without previous urokinase infusion. Detection of restenosis by clinical surveillance led to redilation or stent placement. Rethromboses in four forearm and six <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> fistulae were treated by 20 further declottings by aspiration. ResultsThe initial success was 93 % in the forearm and 76 % in the <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> (99 % in grafts). The complications included one pulmonary embolism, one acute pseudoaneurysm, and one blood depletion requiring transfusion. Primary patency rates at one year were 49 % in the forearm and 9 % in the <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> (14 % in grafts). Secondary patency rates were 81 and 50 % at one year, respectively (83 % in grafts). Reinterventions were necessary every 19. 6 months in the forearm and every 5. 7 months in the <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> (every 6. 4 months in grafts, P < 0. 05). Stents were placed in 11 % of forearm fistulae and in 41 % of <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> fistulae (45 % of grafts) for treatment of acute rupture (5 out of 19), stenosis recoil (6 out of 19), and early (< 6 months) recurring stenosis (8 out of 19). ConclusionsThe percutaneous declotting of forearm fistulae by manual catheter-directed thromboaspiration was effective in more than 90 % of cases and yielded 50 % primary and 80 % secondary patency rates at one year. The results were poorer in <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> fistulae.

40|$|Multiple {{studies have}} {{provided}} compelling {{evidence that the}} FTO gene variants are associated with obesity measures. The objective {{of the study was}} to investigate whether FTO variants are associated with a broad range of obesity related anthropometric traits in an island population. We examined genetic association between 29 FTO SNPs and a comprehensive set of anthropometric traits in 843 unrelated individuals from an island population in the eastern Adriatic coast of Croatia. The traits include 11 anthropometrics (height, weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, bicondilar <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> width, <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> circumference, and biceps, triceps, subscapular, suprailiac and abdominal skin-fold thicknesses) and two derived measures (BMI and WHR). Using single locus score tests, 15 common SNPs were found to be significantly associated with "body fatness" measures such as weight, BMI, hip and waist circumferences with P-values ranging from 0. 0004 to 0. 01. Similar but less significant associations were also observed between these markers and bicondilar <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> width and <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> circumference. Most of these significant findings could be explained by a mediating effect of "body fatness". However, one unique association signal between <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> width and rs 16952517 (P-value = 0. 00156) could not be explained by this mediating effect. In addition, using a principle component analysis and conditional association tests adjusted for "body fatness", two novel association signals were identified between <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> circumference and rs 11075986 (P-value = 0. 00211) and rs 16945088 (P-value = 0. 00203). The current study confirmed the association of common variants of FTO gene with "body fatness" measures in an isolated island population. We also observed evidence of pleiotropic effects of FTO gene on fat-free mass, such as frame size and muscle mass assessed by bicondilar <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> width and <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> circumference respectively and these pleiotropic effects might be influenced by variants that are different from the ones associated with "body fatness"...|$|R

Anthropomorphic transhumeral <b>arm</b> <b>prosthesis</b> is proposed in this thesis to assist the activities of daily living of amputees. The prosthesis generates elbow flexion/extension, forearm supination/pronation, wrist ulna/radial deviation, wrist flexion/extension and another 11 DoF at the terminal device. In order to generate the wrist flexion/extension and ulna/radial deviation, a novel wrist mechanism is proposed based on the parallel prismatic manipulators. Two wrist motions occur in two different axes. The wrist design also follows the human anatomical structure. It is expected to realize high speed operation, higher positional accuracy and anthropomorphic features using the proposed mechanism. The <b>arm</b> <b>prosthesis</b> consists of an under-actuated hand as the terminal device with intrinsic actuation. A novel under-actuated mechanism is introduced as the finger designs, except for the thumb. The mechanism is capable of generating 3 DoF for the finger design. It further poses the capability of adjusting the finger joint angles passively, according to the geometry of the grasping object. With the intention of verifying the effectiveness of the mechanisms in motion generation, motion simulation and kinematic analysis are carried out.
