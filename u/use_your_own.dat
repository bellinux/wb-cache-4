2500|$|The Marine {{battalion}} landed unopposed on 10 June {{with five}} of its six companies, leaving the artillery company aboard to unload the ship, as Commander Reiter, {{the captain of}} the Panther, had refused to authorize the use of ship's personnel for unloading duties. [...] Reiter also refused to permit the unloading of the remainder of the Marines' small arms ammunition, claiming that it was needed as ship's ballast. [...] Lt. Col. Huntington sought assistance from Commander McCalla, who ordered Reiter to release the Marine's ammunition at once: [...] "Sir, break out immediately and land with the crew of the Panther, 50,000 rounds of 6-mm. ammunition," [...] McCalla ordered. [...] "In the future, do not require Colonel Huntington to break out or land his stores with members of his command. <b>Use</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> officers and men for this purpose, and supply the Commanding Officer of Marines promptly with anything he may desire." ...|$|E
2500|$|Taking {{advantage}} of their new-found success and status, the couple formed a production company, [...] "Gloria Films", producing the comedy Three Husbands with Eve Arden and Ruth Warwick, and the film noir the Scarf starring John Ireland and Mercedes McCambridge. [...] Unfortunately, Caspary and Igee forgot {{the first rule of}} finance, [...] "never <b>use</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> money", and had put all their own funds and savings into the company. [...] Their films were contracted to United Artists, and when United Artists went into bankruptcy and restructuring in 1950, the films of Gloria Films were tied up in litigation and the couple lost everything. [...] Many small production companies went bankrupt as a result of United Artists' troubles – Caspary could not afford to, as she would have lost future royalties for works she had already written and any payments for reprints of her books. [...] Igee was devastated at the loss, he would never get to be the bread winner of the couple. [...] In December, Caspary drove to MGM and sold them a story treatment for $50,000 dollars, with a 50% advance. [...] In January she sold them another for $45,000 and in February sold one to Paramount for $35,000. [...] This last sale, the couple deposited in New York, which was fortunate as it would {{be a long time before}} they worked again in Hollywood.|$|E

40|$|PortOpt [Portfolio Optimizer] is a C++ program (with Python binding) {{implementing}} the Markowitz(1952) mean-variance model with agent's linear indifference curves toward risk {{in order to}} find the optimal assets portfolio under risk. You have to provide PortOpt (in text files or - if you use the api - <b>using</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> code) the variance/covariance matrix of the assets, their average returns and the agent risk preference. It returns the vector of assets' shares that composes the optimal portfolio. In order to minimise the variance it internally uses QuadProg++, a library that implement the algorithm of Goldfarb and Idnani for the solution of a (convex) Quadratic Programming problem by means of an active-set dual method. This solution is very efficient as it allows to solve hundred of thousand of portfolio problems in seconds.
