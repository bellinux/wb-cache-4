The present work provides conceptual process design and economic feasibility analysis for microalgae cultivation and extraction of oil and conversion of microalgal oil into biodiesel using Aspen plus. In the present work, the nannochloropsis salina was considered as microalgae species with chemical formula of C 50 H 50 O 30 N 7. The microalgae were cultivated in a tubular photo bioreactor [...] In the present work, microalgal oil was considered as a mixture of triglycerides containing three same fatty acid groups in the structure. The physicochemical properties of these triglycerides and microalgae were included in Aspen Plus to regress the property methods.

The challenges involved in the process are frequently neglected or undervalued.

Producers are usually not trained to this end and tend to underestimate competences and investments that may be necessary.

This paper presents an extensive review of the presented formulations for the modeling of taxi services in urban areas. The variables of the problem are identified and analyzed, presenting the different formulations proposed in the literature for each one of the three operational modes (hailing, stand and dispatching). The paper also presents an aggregated mathematical model for the estimation of the key performance indicators of taxi markets in urban areas taking into account demand elasticity. These key parameters are basically the demand and supply for taxi services, the waiting time of taxi users and the cost of the involved actors, i. e. the customers and the drivers. A generalized cost function is proposed and applied to the dispatching taxi services market, obtaining results in terms of demand, system <b>unitary</b> <b>costs,</b> waiting time and drivers’ benefit for different combinations of supply and fares.

40|$|This paper aims to seek {{evidence}} of environmentalism {{among the poor}} by asking two questions: i) is environmental perception, knowledge and behavior positively influenced by thesocioeconomic status and objective environmental conditions of individuals?; ii) Does the nature of behavior (collective versus private) influence pro-environmental actions among the poor? Using novel household-level data representative of two metropolitan regions in the State of São Paulo, Brazil, we measure and describe perceptions and behavior about several environmental issues using the Grade of Membership (GoM) technique and fixed-effect logistic regression. Based on our findings, we argue that past evidence on low levels of pro-environmental behavior in low-income settings may reflect the inability of differentiating private (individual) from public (collective) environmental behavior. We address these limitations by including questions about actual and intended environmental behavior that explicitly differentiates individual from collective actions.

The novelty {{lies in the fact}} that the vehicle does not include any dedicated sensors for wind characterization, but acts itself as a sensor. This is done by applying an algorithm that relates tilt angle of the vehicle to the local wind speed and direction, sparing the use of external measurement devices such as anemometers, multi-hole probes or any other conventional measurement instrument. <b>Unitary</b> <b>costs</b> and complexity can be consequently significantly reduced. An algorithm for computing wind speed and direction is derived from the dynamic pressure equation, while wind direction is derived from simple trigonometry. As a first approach, wind speed is estimated by solely using the angles computed by the flight controller, dismissing dynamic effects. As a second approach, dynamic linear equations describing the behavior of the quadrotor are used to estimate wind speed, dynamic effects included. In the third approach, wind speed estimation is addressed by using a Lineal Kalman Filter (LKF), where dynamic effects are also taken into account.
