5|$|The {{bottom end}} {{of the body is}} an ampulla (a flask-like swelling), which anchors the animal in the tube and enables it to retract its body very quickly when threatened. When the lophophore is {{extended}} {{at the top of the}} body, cilia (little hairs) on the sides of the tentacles draw food particles to the mouth, which is inside and slightly to one side of the base of the lophophore. <b>Unwanted</b> <b>material</b> can be excluded by closing a lid above the mouth or be rejected by the tentacles, whose cilia can switch into reverse. The food then moves down to the stomach, which is in the ampulla. Solid wastes are moved up the intestine and out through the anus, which is outside and slightly below the lophophore.|$|E
5|$|When the lophophore is extended, cilia (little hairs) on {{the sides}} of the tentacles draw water down between the tentacles and out at the base of the lophophore. Shorter cilia on the inner sides of the tentacles flick food {{particles}} into a groove in a circle under and just inside the tentacles, and cilia in the groove push the particles into the mouth. Phoronids direct their lophophores into the water current, and quickly reorient to maximize the food-catching area when currents change. Their diet includes algae, diatoms, flagellates, peridinians, small invertebrate larvae, and detritus. <b>Unwanted</b> <b>material</b> can be excluded by closing the epistome (lid above the mouth) or be rejected by the tentacles, whose cilia can switch into reverse. The gut uses cilia and muscles to move food towards the stomach and secretes enzymes that digest some of the food, but the stomach digests the majority of the food. Phoronids also absorb amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) through their skins, mainly in summer. Solid wastes are moved up the intestine and out through the anus, which is outside and slightly below the lophophore.|$|E
25|$|Enlarged spleen: The spleen aids in {{fighting}} infection and filters <b>unwanted</b> <b>material,</b> such as old or damaged blood cells. Thalassemia is {{often accompanied by}} {{the destruction of a}} large number of red blood cells and the task of removing these cells causes the spleen to enlarge. Splenomegaly can make anemia worse, and it can reduce the life of transfused red blood cells. Severe enlargement of the spleen may necessitate its removal.|$|E

25|$|In {{a similar}} fashion to streamworking, much use was made of water {{for the removal of}} the {{overburden}} and gangue. When digging large gullies the overburden, which consisted at least partly of decomposed granite ("growan"), was loosened with picks, and then water was used to wash away the <b>unwanted</b> <b>material</b> instead of manhandling it. Means of collecting, diverting and storing water were always associated with openworks. In some cases when only poor sources of water were available complex systems of reservoirs were built.|$|E
2500|$|The mucopolysaccharidoses {{are part}} of the {{lysosomal}} storage disease family, a group of more than 40 genetic disorders that result when the lysosome organelle in animal cells malfunctions. [...] The lysosome {{can be thought of as}} the cell's recycling center because it processes <b>unwanted</b> <b>material</b> into other substances that the cell can utilize. [...] Lysosomes break down this unwanted matter via enzymes, highly specialized proteins essential for survival. [...] Lysosomal disorders like mucopolysaccharidosis are triggered when a particular enzyme exists in too small an amount or is missing altogether.|$|E

50|$|Code cleanup {{refers to}} {{the act of writing}} code so that it cleans up {{leftover}} data structures and other <b>unwanted</b> <b>materials</b> from memory and the filesystem.

50|$|Foreign body {{contamination}} is <b>unwanted</b> <b>material</b> that {{differs from}} the virgin material going over and through the screen.

5000|$|Pseudofeces {{accumulate}} with, {{and look}} much like, the actual feces {{in the bottom}} of the mantle cavity. The <b>unwanted</b> <b>material</b> is periodically ejected (usually through the inhalant siphon or aperture) by contractions of the adductor muscles, which [...] "clap" [...] the shells together, pushing most of the water out of the mantle cavity and forcibly ejecting both the feces and the pseudofeces.|$|E
