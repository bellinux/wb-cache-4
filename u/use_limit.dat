25|$|Perception {{surrounding}} smoking has varied {{over time}} and {{from one place to}} another: holy and sinful, sophisticated and vulgar, a panacea and deadly health hazard. In the 20th century, smoking came to be viewed in a decidedly negative light, especially in Western countries. This is due to smoking tobacco being among the leading causes of many diseases such as lung cancer, heart attack, COPD, erectile dysfunction, and birth defects. The health hazards of smoking have caused many countries to institute high taxes on tobacco products, run ads to discourage <b>use,</b> <b>limit</b> ads that promote use, and provide help with quitting for those who do smoke.|$|E

5000|$|Mitigation is {{the attempt}} to stop the {{droughts}} from occurring, since this is an environmental process, {{the ability to control}} it is slim. There are few options which involving helping the environment to stabilize the climate and try to reduce the likelihood of severe droughts. Implementing policy to begin efforts to help climate will lead to less variable weather partners, which in turn stabilize the environment and reduce drought occurrences. To expand upon the possible policy options, policies including water <b>use</b> <b>limit</b> per household, water recycling requirements, etc. Let’s evaluate both policies starting with water <b>use</b> <b>limit</b> per household, this policy would likely work to decrease water use which would reduce the need for water and limit the effects of a drought. This policy would not cost much, only the need to install monitors in the household which track the amount of water used. The citizens would be against this policy since they would want to have unlimited access to water. But the politicians and environmentalists would be in favor because it would reduce the water crisis and help with the drought. This policy would likely not easy political acceptability because many people would likely fight this policy and file lawsuits on the government for mandating their water. Water recycling requirements is different from recycling wastewater because it would be a policy requiring water recycling for everyone and it would include more than just waste water, such as rain water.|$|E

For bookings shorter than 72 hours, 20 miles free fuel was provided per calendar day, after which additional mileage was charged at 22p per mile. On March 1, 2011, Streetcar announced that their Overnight Rate would become a permanent feature, after previously being a limited offer.

5000|$|In 1997, the FDA {{proposed}} a regulation on ephedra (the herb from which ephedrine is obtained), which limited an ephedra dose to 8 mg (of active ephedrine) {{with no more}} than 24 mg per day. This proposed rule was withdrawn, in part, in 2000 because of [...] "concerns regarding the agency's basis for proposing a certain dietary ingredient level and a duration of <b>use</b> <b>limit</b> for these products." [...] In 2004, the FDA created a ban on ephedrine alkaloids marketed for reasons other than asthma, colds, allergies, other disease, or traditional Asian use. On April 14, 2005, the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah ruled the FDA did not have proper evidence that low dosages of ephedrine alkaloids are actually unsafe, but on August 17, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver upheld the FDA's final rule declaring all dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids adulterated, and therefore illegal for marketing in the United States. Furthermore, ephedrine is banned by the NCAA, MLB, NFL, and PGA. Ephedrine is, however, still legal in many applications outside of dietary supplements. Purchasing is currently limited and monitored, with specifics varying from state to state.|$|E

40|$|This Internet Appendix {{contains}} {{details on}} three additional analyses that were {{omitted from the}} body of the paper for brevity. The first part examines why individual investors <b>use</b> <b>limit</b> orders. In particular, the first section discusses the theory of order choice, measures the relation between individuals ’ order choices and the state of the market, and compares individuals ’ order choices to choices made by different types of traders in the limit order book model of Goettler, Parlour, and Rajan (2009). The second part replicates the main tests of Gutierrez and Kelley (2008) on the long-lasting momentum in weekly returns using Finnish return data. In the body of the paper I note that the similarity between this momentum pattern and the limit order loss pattern suggests that price momentum may be the primary driver of limit order losses. Finally, the third part uses U. S. brokerage firm data to study the sensitivity of disposition effect estimates to same-day stock price movements. Because price movements drive limit order executions, this analysis provides indirect evidence on the economic significance of the limit order effect in the U. S. data set. I.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the possibility of}} signal jamming between multiple informed incumbents with conflicting interests and examines the implication of the possibility in the limit pricing literature. I find fully separating equilibria where the incumbent competing against the entrant does not <b>use</b> <b>limit</b> pricing in an optimal response to “inductive pricing” by another incumbent desiring entry i. e., charging a lower price than the static equilibrium price to induce entry. Thus, contrary to Milgrom and Roborts, the consequences of asymmetric information for welfare are ambiguous even in fully separating equilibria. [L 11]...|$|E
