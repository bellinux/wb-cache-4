5|$|Nitrous oxide (N2O), {{better known}} as {{laughing}} gas, is made by thermal decomposition of molten ammonium nitrate at 250°C. This is a redox reaction and thus nitric oxide and nitrogen are also produced as byproducts. It is mostly used as a propellant and aerating agent for sprayed canned whipped cream, and was formerly commonly used as an anaesthetic. Despite appearances, it cannot {{be considered to be}} the anhydride of hyponitrous acid (H2N2O2) because that acid is not produced by the dissolution of nitrous oxide in water. It is rather unreactive (not reacting with the halogens, the alkali metals, or ozone at room temperature, although reactivity increases upon heating) and has the <b>unsymmetrical</b> structure N–N–O (N≡N+O−↔−N=N+=O): above 600°C it dissociates by breaking the weaker N–O bond.|$|E
5|$|The {{addition}} of the extra docking port caused {{the adoption of the}} Almaz-derived twin-chamber propulsion system first used on Salyut 3 and 5, with the two engine nozzleseach producing 2.9kilonewtons of thrustmounted peripherally {{on either side of the}} aft port. Salyut 6 introduced a Unified Propulsion System, with both the engines and the station's control thrusters running on <b>unsymmetrical</b> dimethylhydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide, drawn from a common set of pressurized tanks, allowing the refueling capabilities of the visiting Progress tankers to be exploited to the maximum effect. The entire engine and fuel storage assembly was contained within an unpressurized bay at the rear of the station, which was the same diameter as the main pressurized compartment. However, the replacement of the Soyuz engine used on previous stations with the bay meant that the station kept a similar overall length to its predecessors. The main engines could not be fired if the rear docking port was in use, hence any orbital maneuvers during this time had to be performed by the visiting spacecraft.|$|E

25|$|An {{unstable}} water jet, {{similar to}} the one shown in the flow instability section above, was not disturbed deliberately, but was allowed to rise to a free water surface. On contact with the surface, a slight jet asymmetry caused an <b>unsymmetrical</b> raised surface that fed back to the jet origin and began a process that looked like a weak version of the flow instability figure. If the jet was not powered, but warmer than the surrounding fluid, it would rise and when encountering the surface would generate a similar feedback system.|$|E
25|$|The E2 {{mechanism}} {{provides a}} more reliable β-elimination method than E1 for most alkene syntheses. Most E2 eliminations start with an alkyl halide or alkyl sulfonate ester (such as a tosylate or triflate). When an alkyl halide is used, the reaction is called a dehydrohalogenation. For <b>unsymmetrical</b> products, the more substituted alkenes (those with fewer hydrogens attached to the C=C) tend to predominate (see Zaitsev's rule). Two common methods of elimination reactions are dehydrohalogenation of alkyl halides and dehydration of alcohols. A typical example is shown below; note that if possible, the H is anti to the leaving group, even though {{this leads to the}} less stable Z-isomer.|$|E
500|$|Marochetti {{proposed}} to install it in Old Palace Yard outside the south window of Westminster Hall. His idea was {{considered by the}} Fine Arts Commission for the Palace of Westminster and was deemed acceptable, although Sir Charles Barry again opposed it. His reasoning was that Old Palace Yard was [...] "too limited in area, and too irregular and <b>unsymmetrical</b> in its form and approaches, to give due effect to it, {{as a work of}} art ..." [...] For his part, Marochetti positively preferred the location's irregularity to the symmetry of a formally laid-out square. The dispute continued until 1859 when the Commissioner of Works, Lord John Manners, finally agreed to install the statue in Marochetti's favoured location. By this time Sir Charles Barry was seriously ill (and died on 12 May 1860) so was no longer in a position to offer opposition.|$|E
500|$|Under {{standard}} conditions, silver {{does not}} form simple carbonyls, {{due to the}} weakness of the Ag–C bond. A few are known at very low temperatures around 6–15K, such as the green, planar paramagnetic Ag(CO)3, which dimerizes at 25–30K, probably by forming Ag–Ag bonds. Additionally, the silver carbonyl [...] is known. Polymeric AgLX complexes with alkenes and alkynes are known, but their bonds are thermodynamically weaker than even those of the platinum complexes (though they are formed more readily than those of the analogous gold complexes): they are also quite <b>unsymmetrical,</b> showing the weak ' bonding in group 11. Ag–C ' bonds may also be formed by silver(I), like copper(I) and gold(I), but the simple alkyls and aryls of silver(I) are even less stable than those of copper(I) (which tend to explode under ambient conditions). For example, poor thermal stability is reflected in the relative decomposition temperatures of AgMe (−50°C) and CuMe (−15°C) {{as well as those of}} PhAg (74°C) and PhCu (100°C).|$|E

2500|$|This direct {{nucleophilic}} substitution reaction requires elevated temperatures (about 125°C). The {{reaction is}} catalyzed by acids, usually sulfuric acid. The method is effective for generating symmetrical ethers, but not <b>unsymmetrical</b> ethers, since either OH can be protonated, {{which would give}} a mixture of products. Diethyl ether is produced from ethanol by this method. Cyclic ethers are readily generated by this approach. Elimination reactions compete with dehydration of the alcohol: ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{standard}} Redstone {{was fueled}} with a 75 percent ethyl alcohol 25 percent water solution, {{essentially the same}} propellants as the V-2, but the Jupiter-C first stage had used hydyne fuel, a blend of 60 percent <b>unsymmetrical</b> dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and 40 percent diethylenetriamine (DETA). [...] This was a more powerful fuel than ethyl alcohol, {{but it was also}} more toxic, which could be hazardous for an astronaut in a launch pad emergency. [...] Furthermore, hydyne had never been used with the new A-7 engine. [...] The Mercury-Redstone designers rejected hydyne and returned to the standard ethyl alcohol fuel. The lengthened propellant tanks were thus also necessary in lieu of using less powerful fuel.|$|E
2500|$|Ethers (...) are a {{class of}} organic {{compounds}} that contain an ether group—an oxygen atom connected to two alkyl or aryl groups. [...] They have the general formula R–O–R′, where R and R′ represent the alkyl or aryl groups. Ethers can again be classified into two varieties: if the alkyl groups are the same {{on both sides of}} the oxygen atom, then it is a simple or symmetrical ether, whereas if they are different, the ethers are called mixed or <b>unsymmetrical</b> ethers. A typical example of the first group is the solvent and anesthetic diethyl ether, commonly referred to simply as [...] "ether" [...] (...) [...] Ethers are common in organic chemistry and even more prevalent in biochemistry, as they are common linkages in carbohydrates and lignin.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most serious}} problem, the muzzle climb, was solved by modifying the muzzle brake to direct {{propellant}} gases only upwards, thus providing {{a force to}} counteract the muzzle climb from recoil. However, this <b>unsymmetrical</b> force also necessitated reinforcing the barrels and barrel jackets. Another important improvement was a new sight for the weapon. An additional rectangular bar was fitted between the rear and front sights and the front ring sight was mounted on this bar {{so that it could}} be moved back and forth based on the estimated speed of the aircraft. The ring sight was re-designed, with an outer ring for 60° shooting angle and an inner ring for 30° angle. The conical mount was replaced with a new tubular tripod mount M/40. The tripod was later further modified to reduce weight. Total modifications are: ...|$|E

2500|$|Helsinki {{had been}} founded as a trading town by Gustav I in 1550 {{as the town}} of Helsingfors, which he {{intended}} to be a rival to the Hanseatic city of Reval (today known as Tallinn), directly south across the Gulf of Finland. The siting proved unfavourable and the town remained small and insignificant, and it was plagued by poverty and diseases. The site was changed in 1640. But even with a new grid town plan the architecture of the town remained modest, mainly single-storey buildings. However, the development in Helsinki's architecture came after 1748 with the construction of the Sveaborg fortress - nowadays a World Heritage Site - (first planned by Augustin Ehrensvärd) on a group of islands just off the coast from Helsinki; the heart of the fortress was a dockyard, but distinct Baroque architecture as well as an English-style landscape park were placed within the otherwise <b>unsymmetrical</b> fortification system, all built in stone and brick, and many of the [...] "windows" [...] in the classical facade compositions were in fact painted on. The architecture of the buildings was in a restrained Rococo classicism named after the influential Swedish architect Carl Hårleman(1700-1753). Hårleman had been responsible for completing the Royal Palace in Stockholm, begun by Nicodemus Tessin the Younger, but he himself was also responsible for the design of the grand entrance to the Sveaborg fortress, the so-called King's Gate and may well have had an input, too, in the design of other key residential buildings there.|$|E

60|$|Without {{committing}} {{ourselves to}} it {{as more than a}} speculation, though a highly probable one, let us again commence with the evolution of the solar system out of a nebulous medium.[3] From the mutual attraction of the atoms of a diffused mass whose form is <b>unsymmetrical,</b> there results not only condensation but rotation: gravitation simultaneously generates both the centripetal and the centrifugal forces. While the condensation and the rate of rotation are progressively increasing, the approach of the atoms necessarily generates a progressively increasing temperature. As this temperature rises, light begins to be evolved; and ultimately there results a revolving sphere of fluid matter radiating intense heat and light--a sun.|$|E

But the Auroræ are strictly cinqfoil. These last are the only European form of a larger group, well named 'Azalea' from the Greek [Greek: aza], dryness, and its adjective [Greek: azalea], dry or parched; and this name must be kept for the world-wide group, (including under it Rhododendron, but not Kalmia,) because there is an under-meaning in the word Aza, enabling it to be applied to the substance of dry earth, and indicating one of the great functions of the Oreiades, in common with the mosses,--the collection of earth upon rocks.|$|E

What is still more singular, unless Gottfried is a consummate actor, we must believe that his right hand has recently become his left. Since the occurrences we are about to consider (as impartially as possible), he has found the utmost difficulty in writing, except from right to left across the paper with his left hand. He cannot throw with his right hand, he is perplexed at meal-times between knife and fork, and his ideas of the rule of the road--he is a cyclist--are still a dangerous confusion. And there is not a scrap of evidence to show that before these occurrences Gottfried was at all left-handed.|$|E
