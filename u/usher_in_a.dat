5|$|While Bahá'u'lláh did not himself {{directly}} {{claim to}} be either the Hindu or Buddhist messiah, he did so in principle through his writings. Later, `Abdu'l-Bahá stated that Bahá'u'lláh was the Kalki avatar, who in the classical Hindu Vaishnavas tradition is the tenth and final Avatar (great incarnation) of Vishnu who will come to end The Age of Darkness and Destruction. Bahá'ís also believe that Bahá'u'lláh is the fulfilment of the prophecy of appearance of the Maitreya Buddha, who is a future Buddha who will eventually appear on earth, achieve complete enlightenment, and teach the pure Dharma. Bahá'ís believe that the prophecy that Maitreya will <b>usher</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> new society of tolerance and love has been fulfilled by Bahá'u'lláh's teachings on world peace. Bahá'u'lláh {{is believed to be}} a descendant of a long line of kings in Persia through Yazdgerd III, the last monarch of the Sasanian Dynasty; he also asserted to be a descendant of Abraham through his third wife Keturah.|$|E

25|$|The reformers {{imagined}} that {{the elimination of the}} orthodox and Ṣūfī religious establishments, along with traditional religious education, and their replacement with a system in which the original sources were available to all in the vernacular language, would pave the way for a new vision of Islam open to progress and modernity and <b>usher</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> society guided by modernity.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{continued to}} attempt economic reforms, and the populace became increasingly dissatisfied. In response to growing demands for multi-party democracy, the Traoré regime allowed some limited political liberalization.

25|$|It {{should be}} noted that the legal coming of age often does not {{correspond}} with the sudden realization of autonomy; many adolescents who have legally reached adult age are still dependent on their guardians or peers for emotional and financial support. Nonetheless, new legal privileges converge with shifting social expectations to <b>usher</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> phase of heightened independence or social responsibility for most legal adolescents.|$|E
25|$|The Fantastic Four is {{a fictional}} superhero team {{appearing}} in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The group debuted in The Fantastic Four #1 (cover dated Nov. 1961), which helped to <b>usher</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{new level of}} realism in the medium. The Fantastic Four was the first superhero team created by editor/co-plotter Stan Lee and artist/co-plotter Jack Kirby, who developed a collaborative approach to creating comics with this title that they would use from then on.|$|E
25|$|In 1386 John left England to {{seek the}} throne of Castile, claimed in Jure uxoris by right of his second wife, Constance of Castile, whom he had married in 1371. However, crisis ensued almost {{immediately}} in his absence, and in 1387 King Richard's misrule brought England {{to the brink of}} civil war. Only John, on his return to England in 1389, succeeded in persuading the Lords Appellant and King Richard to compromise to <b>usher</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> period of relative stability. During the 1390s, John's reputation of devotion to the well-being of the kingdom was largely restored.|$|E

25|$|The First Victory Test {{started at}} Lord's on 19 May and was {{expected}} to <b>usher</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> new post-war era, which it hoped would be more aggressive and attractive. The last Anglo-Australian Test series before the war had featured {{a large number of}} draws due to defensive play. England won the toss and batted first. They batted steadily although none of their specialist batsmen managed to pass 57 and reached 4/205, before Miller came on as the fifth bowler and bowled his Great Massingham pilot colleague Bill Edrich for 45, precipitating an English collapse from 4/200 to 267. Paceman Albert Cheetham took 3/49, while new ball partner Williams, spinner Reginald Ellis and Charles Price took two wickets each.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not known}} what {{language}} these early Scandinavians spoke. It might have been similar to Basque, due to {{the distribution of the}} monuments by early megalith builders. Towards the end of the 3rd millennium BC, they were overrun by new groups who many scholars think spoke Proto-Indo-European, the Battle-Axe culture. This new people advanced up to Uppland and the Oslofjord, and they probably provided the language that was the ancestor of the modern Scandinavian languages. This new culture was individualistic and patriarchal with the battle axe as a status symbol, and were cattle herders. However, soon a new invention would arrive, that would <b>usher</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> time of cultural advance in Scandinavia, the Bronze Age.|$|E
25|$|The {{final week}} of the season still held playoff hopes, {{although}} it would take a Buccaneers win over Oakland coupled with a Dallas loss. The Buccaneers couldn't hold their 4th quarter lead against the Raiders, and lost 31-24. Adding insult to injury, Dallas lost their final game against Philadelphia, giving the Eagles the final wild card playoff spot over Dallas and the Bucs. Having finished 9-7 and missing the playoffs, Jon Gruden was fired January 16, 2009, almost one year to the date he received a contract-extension. GM Bruce Allen was fired on the same date as well. This would <b>usher</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wholesale change of coaches and players leading up to the 2009 season, with Raheem Morris being elevated to head coach on January 17.|$|E

25|$|The {{games of}} {{previous}} millennia were discontinued and then revived by Lycurgus of Sparta, Iphitos of Elis, and Cleisthenes of Pisa {{at the behest}} of the Oracle of Delphi who claimed that the people had strayed from the gods, which had caused a plague and constant war. Restoration of the games would end the plague, <b>usher</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> time of peace, and signal a return to a more traditional lifestyle. The patterns that emerge from these myths are that the Greeks believed the games had their roots in religion, that athletic competition was tied to worship of the gods, and the revival of the ancient games was intended to bring peace, harmony and a return to the origins of Greek life.|$|E
25|$|In April 1856 the 16-year-old Xhosa prophetess Nongqawuse {{began to}} declare that she had {{received}} {{a message from the}} Xhosa people's ancestors, promising deliverance from their hardships. She preached that the ancestors would return from the afterlife in huge numbers, drive all Europeans into the sea, and give the Xhosa bounteous gifts of horses, sheep, goats, dogs, fowls, and all manner of clothing and food in great amounts. They would also restore the elderly to youth and would <b>usher</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> utopian era of prosperity. However, she declared that the dead ancestors would only enact this on condition that the Xhosa first destroyed all their means of subsistence. They needed to kill all of their cattle and burn all of their crops.|$|E
25|$|Numerous canal {{companies}} {{had also been}} chartered; but of all the canals projected, only three had been completed when the War of 1812 began: the Dismal Swamp Canal in Virginia, the Santee Canal in South Carolina, and the Middlesex Canal in Massachusetts. It remained for New York to <b>usher</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> new era in internal communication by authorizing in 1817 {{the construction of the}} Erie Canal. This bold bid for Western trade alarmed the merchants of Philadelphia, particularly as the completion of the national road threatened to divert much of their traffic to Baltimore. In 1825, the legislature of Pennsylvania grappled with the problem by projecting a series of canals which were to connect its great seaport with Pittsburgh on the west and with Lake Erie and the upper Susquehanna on the north. The Blackstone Canal, (1823–1828) in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, and the Morris Canal across northern New Jersey (1824–1924) soon followed, along with the Illinois and Michigan Canal from Chicago to the Illinois River(1824–1848).|$|E

25|$|In 1997, Muster {{enjoyed the}} best results of his career on hardcourt. He reached the semifinals of the 1997 Australian Open, losing to {{eventual}} champion Pete Sampras. He {{then went on to}} win the tournament in Dubai, defeating Goran Ivanišević in the final. Muster went on to win his biggest title on hardcourt at the 1997 Miami Masters, the same tournament where his career had nearly ended eight years earlier, by defeating Sergi Bruguera in three straight sets in the final, after Bruguera had defeated Sampras in the semifinals. Muster was also the runner-up at the Cincinnati Masters, where he lost in the final to Sampras. He achieved a 29–8 win-loss record on hardcourt during 1997, although he only won 9 out of 18 matches on clay in the same year. Muster's 1997 French Open campaign ended in the third round, when the unseeded Gustavo Kuerten, then ranked at 66 in the world, defeated him. Kuerten {{went on to win the}} 1997 French Open title and <b>usher</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> new era on clay.|$|E
25|$|Sorey and {{his friends}} then confront Heldalf again, but figure out that {{something}} is amiss as he does not show any intention to kill them immediately, as after failing to provoke Sorey, Heldalf attempts to convince him to join his side: this prompts the party to retreat {{and look for the}} true reason behind his motives before their final confrontation. It is revealed that the Era of Chaos was initiated when the previous Shepherd turned Heldalf, a Rolance military general at a time, into a cursed immortal being by infusing him with the fallen Seraph Maotelus when he refused to provide aid to his village when it was invaded: this filled his life with hatred and turned him into the Lord of Calamity. It was also revealed that two infants from the village, Sorey and Mikleo, were saved and taken in to be raised with the Seraphim. With the truth revealed and understood, the Shepherd and his comrades take on Heldalf once again and defeat him once and for all, turning Heldalf back into his human self and Sorey finally ending his life, giving him the peace he craved. Sorey then merges with Maotelus to expel the malevolence from the world and <b>usher</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> new era, where both the Seraphim and humans finally live together peacefully. In a post-credits sequence, a future Mikleo is shown exploring some ruins, and is saved from a fall by a reawakened Sorey.|$|E
