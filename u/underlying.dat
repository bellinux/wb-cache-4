5|$|A {{powerful}} way {{of studying}} rings is through their modules. A module {{consists of a}} choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from the <b>underlying</b> set of the ring and called the <b>underlying</b> set of the module, an operation on pairs of elements of the <b>underlying</b> set of the module, and an operation which takes {{an element of the}} ring and an element of the module and returns an element of the module. The <b>underlying</b> set of the module and its operation must form a group. A module is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second ring operation and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal the structure of the ring in ways that are not apparent from the ring itself. An important special case of this is an algebra. (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each ring and returns an element of the second ring. This operation makes the second ring into a module over the first. Often the first ring is a field.|$|E
40|$|Overlay {{applications}} are popular as they provide high-level functionality by masking the intrinsic {{complexity of the}} <b>underlay</b> network. However, overlays rely on the <b>underlay</b> {{to provide them with}} basic connectivity. Therefore, the intrinsic features of the <b>underlay</b> network determine the efficiency of the overlay. Accordingly, studying the interdependency of the overlay and <b>underlay</b> networks leads {{to a better understanding of}} overlay application behavior. We present a visualization-driven analysis technique for evaluating the overlay architecture with respect to the <b>underlay,</b> driven by the goal of overlay engineering.

40|$|Abstract—In an <b>underlay</b> {{cognitive}} radio network, the sec-ondary (<b>underlay)</b> transmitters generate interference to a pri-mary receiver, while an <b>underlay</b> receiver {{is subject to}} interfer-ence from both the primary transmitters and other <b>underlay</b> transmitters not associated with it. Although guard regions, maximum allowable <b>underlay</b> transmit powers, and contention distances help guarantee a minimum performance to the primary network, no such safeguard exists for the <b>underlay</b> network. To this end, this paper characterizes the aggregate interference on an <b>underlay</b> receiver while considering power control and receiver association schemes for both networks. Transmitters and receivers of both networks {{are assumed to be}} distributed as independent Poisson fields in the 2 -D plane, and all links undergo exponential path loss and Rayleigh fading. We derive the moment generating function of the aggregate interference on an <b>underlay</b> receiver and its outage probability. We show that the interference from the primary network does not depend on any node density, and that it dominates the aggregate interference. Furthermore, it is shown that increasing primary and <b>underlay</b> receiver densities reduce the outage probability under lower required power thresholds for the primary receivers. I...|$|R
40|$|We propose {{localized}} and decentralized protocols {{to construct}} and maintain an <b>underlay</b> for sensor networks. An <b>underlay</b> lies in between overlay operations (e. g., data indexing, multicast, etc.) and the sensor network itself. Specifically, an <b>underlay</b> bridges the gap between (a) the unreliability of sensor nodes and communication and availability of only approximate location knowledge, and (b) {{the maintenance of a}} virtual geography-based naming structure that is required by several overlay operations. Our <b>underlay</b> creates a coarse naming scheme based on approximate location knowledge, and then maintains it in an e????cient and scalable manner. The <b>underlay</b> naming can be used to specify arbitrary regions. The overlay operations that can be executed on the <b>underlay</b> include routing, ag- gregation, multicast, data indexing, etc. These overlay operations could be region-based. The proposed <b>underlay</b> maintenance protocols are robust, localized (hence scalable), en- ergy and message efficient, have low convergence times, and provide tuning knobs to trade convergence time with overhead and with <b>underlay</b> uniformity. The maintenance protocols are mathematically analyzed by characterizing them as di????erential equation systems. We present microbenchmark results from a NesC implementation, and results from a large- scale simulation of a Java implementation. The latter experiments also show how routing using the <b>underlay</b> would perform...|$|R

5|$|Chromium metal left {{standing}} in air is passivated by oxidation, forming a thin, protective, surface layer. This layer is a spinel structure {{only a few}} molecules thick. It is very dense, and prevents the diffusion of oxygen into the <b>underlying</b> metal. This {{is different from the}} oxide that forms on iron and carbon steel, through which elemental oxygen continues to migrate, reaching the <b>underlying</b> material to cause incessant rusting. Passivation can be enhanced by short contact with oxidizing acids like nitric acid. Passivated chromium is stable against acids. Passivation can be removed with a strong reducing agent that destroys the protective oxide layer on the metal. Chromium metal treated in this way readily dissolves in weak acids.|$|E

40|$|Publish-subscribe is a {{well-known}} paradigm for building distributed applications. Events produced by peers, called publishers, are disseminated to interested consumers, called subscribers. Usually publishers and subscribers are arranged in a peer-to-peer overlay network, which helps in dissemination of events in a decentralised manner. Recent research tries to provide Quality-of-Service like delay bounds or reliability in such a system. In order to provide reliability current distributed publish-subscribe systems mostly either rely on overlay level acknowledgement protocols or try to find multiple disjoint paths in the overlay to increase redundancy without {{taking into account the}} <b>underlay</b> topology. Acknowledgements induce high delays affecting timeliness of event delivery. Providing multiple paths without looking at the <b>underlay</b> {{does not take into account}} correlations between paths within the <b>underlay.</b> We address these drawbacks by designing a content-based publish-subscribe system which provides reliability by taking into account the <b>underlay</b> topology to reduce correlations within the <b>underlay</b> in overlay links. The system consists of three layers: The Topology-Discovery-Overlay (TDO) layer constructs an <b>underlay</b> topology aware overlay which reflects the <b>underlay</b> topology by using a path-matching algorithm. On top of the TDO the Maximum-Reliability-Spanning-Tree (MRST) layer constructs k overlay link disjoint trees which contain the most reliable overlay links. The MRSTs are used by the content-based publish-subscribe layer for subscription flooding and event forwarding. The system has been evaluated by simulations in PeerSim using Internet-like topologies. The results show that the TDO discovers most of the <b>underlay</b> topology and constructs overlay topologies reflecting the <b>underlay</b> topology. Simulations also show that the system converges towards a maximum event delivery probability...|$|R

Knowledge of <b>underlay</b> properties such as available bandwidths, loss rates and topology can help in efficient construction, maintenance and optimization of overlays which have to provide service guarantees. In absence of any support from the network core, it becomes necessary to infer those properties by performing end-to-end measurements on the network. We develop probing techniques which infer information about {{the structure of the}} <b>underlay</b> and use it for construction of fault-tolerant overlay networks.
