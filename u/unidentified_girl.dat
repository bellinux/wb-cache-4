Richard Frank (R. F.) Uren was a photographer in St. Catharines from 1886 - 1895. Source: Phillips, Glen C. The Ontario photographers list (1851 - 1900). Sarnia: Iron Gate Publishing Co., 1990. "Cabinet card photographs were first introduced in 1866. They were initially employed for landscapes rather than portraitures. Cabinet cards replaced Carte de visite photographs as the popular mode of photography. Cabinet cards became the standard for photographic portraits in 1870. Cabinet cards experienced their peak in popularity in the 1880 's. Cabinet cards were still being produced in the United States until the early 1900 's and continued to be produced in Europe even longer. The best way to describe a cabinet card is that it is a thin photograph that is mounted on a card that measures 4 1 / 4 ″ by 6 1 / 2 ″. Cabinet cards frequently have artistic logos and information on the bottom or the reverse of the card which advertised the photographer or the photography studio's services. " Source: [URL]...|$|R
