To investigate the role(s) of CM 2 glycosylation in the virus replication, we generated rN 11 A, a recombinant influenza C virus lacking the glycosylation site. The rN 11 A virus grew less efficiently than the wild-type (WT) virus, although the biochemical characteristics of the mutant CM 2 {{were similar to those}} of authentic CM 2. The amount of the genome (GFP-vRNA) in the CM 2 -N 11 A-virus-like particles (VLPs) was 13 % of that found in WT-VLPs. The incoming GFP-vRNA was less efficiently transported to the nucleus in CM 2 -N 11 A-VLP-infected cells than WT-VLP-infected cells, leading to the reduced reporter gene expression in CM 2 -N 11 A-VLP-infected cells. Thus the glycosylation of CM 2 is required for efficient replication of influenza C virus, and the obtained findings confirmed and extended the previous observation that CM 2 is involved in the genome packaging and <b>uncoating</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R

40|$|CM 2 is {{the second}} {{membrane}} protein of influenza C virus and possesses three conserved cysteines at residue 1, 6 and 20 in its extracellular domain, {{all of which are}} involved in the formation of disulfide-linked oligomers of the molecule. In the present study, to examine the effect of CM 2 oligomerization on virus replication, we generated a mutant recombinant virus, rC 1620 A, in which all three cysteines on CM 2 were substituted to alanines. The rC 1620 A virus was more attenuated than the recombinant wild-type (rWT) virus in cultured cells. The CM 2 protein synthesized in rC 1620 A-infected cells could not apparently be detected as a tetramer and was transported to the cell surface less efficiently than was authentic CM 2. The amount of CM 2 protein incorporated into the rC 1620 A virions was comparable to that into the rWT virions, although the main CM 2 species in the rC 1620 A virions was {{in the form of a}} dimer. Analyses of one-step grown virions and virus-infected cells could not provide evidence for any difference in growth between rC 1620 A and rWT. On the other hand, the amount of genome present in VLPs possessing the mutant CM 2 (C 1620 A-VLPs) was approximately 31 % of that in VLPs possessing wild-type CM 2 (WT-VLPs). The incoming genome from VLPs was less efficiently transported to the nucleus in the C 1620 A-VLP-infected cells than in WT-VLP-infected cells, leading to reduced reporter gene expression in the C 1620 A-VLP-infected cells. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that CM 2 oligomerization affects the packaging and <b>uncoating</b> <b>processes.</b> Thus, we concluded that disulfide-linked CM 2 oligomers facilitate virus growth by affecting the replication processes...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the late}} stages of alphavirus {{multiplication}} virus cores accumulate in the cytoplasm as stable structures, whereas they are unstable {{during the early}} stages of infection. Three types of explanation can be put forward to understand this phenomenon: (1) A cellular <b>uncoating</b> <b>process</b> is active early which is inactivated later, (2) the core structure differs between stable cores which accumulate and labile cores which are dissociated, (3) both mechanisms cooperate. A model based exclusively on the first principle involving core disassembly by cellular ribosomes has been proposed, but structural changes of the core may cooperate with the cellular <b>uncoating</b> <b>process.</b> We have therefore isolated cores of the Sindbis alphavirus from the cellular cytoplasm, from virus particles (vi-cores), and from low-pH-treated virus particles. Comparative analyses of the structure of these cores, using crosslinking and proteolytic digestion, and of the stability of the cores in the presence of ribosomesin vitrowere performed. The structural comparisons indicate that the interactions between the molecular components of these cores are very similar and probably identical. In the presence of ribosomes vi-cores were slightly more stable than the two other types of cores. Evidence for a cellular uncoating mechanism is furnished by experiments which analyze the stability of cores in the presence of postmitochondrial cytoplasm or of 60 S ribosomal subunits derived from either uninfected or Sindbis virus-infected cells. The results obtained indicate that structural alterations of the core do not {{play a role in the}} regulation of disassembly and assembly of alphavirus cores...|$|E

The GH loop of the capsid polypeptide VP 1 strongly binds to SCARB 2 and is proposed to act as a sensor-adaptor for SCARB 2 binding. Although this is not direct structural evidence, the biochemical data strongly suggest that SCARB 2 binds to the canyon of the virion like other uncoating receptors.|$|E
25|$|Once {{inside the}} host cell, the virus {{must find a}} way to uncoat. The virus {{particles}} enter the cell in a structure known as an endosome (also called an endolysosome).

In particular, retroviral <b>uncoating,</b> a <b>process</b> during which incoming retroviral cores are altered to allow the integration of the viral genome into host chromosomes, is poorly understood. To get insights into these early events of the retroviral cycle, we have used foamy complex retroviruses as a model. In this report, we show that a protease-defective foamy retrovirus is noninfectious, although it is still able to bud and enter target cells efficiently. Similarly, a retrovirus mutated in an essential viral protease-dependent cleavage site in the central part of Gag is noninfectious. Following entry, wild-type and mutant retroviruses are able to traffic along microtubules towards the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC). However, whereas nuclear import of Gag and of the viral genome was observed for the wild-type virus as early as 8 hours postinfection, incoming capsids and genome from mutant viruses remained at the MTOC. Interestingly, a specific viral protease-dependent Gag cleavage product was detected only for the wild-type retrovirus early after infection, demonstrating that cleavage of Gag by the viral protease {{at this stage of the}} virus life cycle is absolutely required for productive infection, an unprecedented observation among retroviruses.

The BM 2 protein is similar to the A/M 2 protein ion channel of influenza A virus (A/M 2) in that it contains an HXXXW motif. Unlike the A/M 2 protein, the BM 2 protein is not inhibited by the antiviral drug amantadine. We used mutagenesis to ascertain the pore-lining residues of the BM 2 ion channel. The specific activity (relative to wild type), reversal voltage, and susceptibility to modification by (2 -aminoethyl) -methane thiosulfonate and N-ethylmaleimide of cysteine mutant proteins were measured in oocytes. It was found that mutation of transmembrane domain residues Ser 9, Ser 12, Phe 13, Ser 16, His 19, and Trp 23 to cysteine were most disruptive for ion channel function. These cysteine mutants were also most susceptible to (2 -aminoethyl) -methane thiosulfonate and N-ethylmaleimide modification. Furthermore, considerable amounts of dimer were formed in the absence of oxidative reagents when cysteine was introduced at positions Ser 9, Ser 12, Ser 16, or Trp 23. Based on these experimental data, a BM 2 transmembrane domain model is proposed. The presence of polar residues in the pore is a probable explanation for the amantadine insensitivity of the BM 2 protein and suggests that related but more polar compounds might serve as useful inhibitors of the protein...|$|R

40|$|The {{process by}} which the human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) conical core dissociates is called uncoating, but not much is known about this process. Here, we show that the <b>uncoating</b> <b>process</b> requires the interaction of the capsid (CA) protein with the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin 1 that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated serine/threonine residue followed by proline. We found that the HIV- 1 core is composed of some isoforms of the CA protein with different isoelectric points, and one isoform is preferentially phosphorylated in the Ser 16 -Pro 17 motif. The mutant virus S 16 A/P 17 A shows a severely attenuated HIV- 1 replication and an impaired reverse transcription. The S 16 A/P 17 A change increased the amount of particulate CA cores in the cytosol of target cells and correlated with the restriction of HIV- 1 infection. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays demonstrated a direct interaction between Pin 1 and the HIV- 1 core via the Ser 16 -Pro 17 motif. Suppression of Pin 1 expression by RNA interference in a target cell results in an attenuated HIV- 1 replication and increases the amount of particulate CA cores in the cytosol of target cells. Furthermore, heat-inactivated, inhibitor-treated, or W 34 A/K 63 A Pin 1 causes an attenuated in vitro uncoating of the HIV- 1 core. The Pin 1 -dependent uncoating is inhibited by antisera raised against a CA peptide phosphorylated at Ser 16 or treatment of the HIV- 1 core with alkaline phosphatase.

It {{is one of the}} biggest hindrances to the international trade of animals and animal products in the world. The virus capsids readily dissociate into pentamers at acidic pH. While there have been several studies on enterovirus <b>uncoating,</b> this <b>process</b> is poorly-understood for aphthoviruses, and there are no published structures elucidating how FMDV undergoes this transformation to infect cells. Furthermore, there are no structures available for a dissociated FMDV pentamer. Thus far, there has been only one paper claiming to show, at low resolution, a disassembly intermediate for another aphthovirus, Equine Rhinitis A Virus (ERAV). Here, a 5. 2 Å-structure of an FMDV assembly formed from acid dissociated pentamers, visualised using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), is presented. This inside-out assembly of the pentamers highlights the extensive conformational changes in the pentamers that may have lead to the disassembly of the native capsid. Also presented here is a lower-resolution structure of the isolated dissociated pentamer (8. 2 Å), enabling a comparison of the differences between native FMDV particles, the dissociated- and the re-assembled pentamers. These analyses elucidate why the pentamers may have been unable to re-assemble properly. Together, these data suggest that the ERAV structure mooted to be a disassembly intermediate may have formed from re-assembled dissociated pentamers. Furthermore, it is concluded that there is still no hard structural evidence that aphthoviruses form an intermediate particle during disassembly. The thesis also includes high-resolution cryo-EM structures of the FMDV serotypes SAT 1 and SAT 3 (3. 8 Å and 3. 1 Å respectively), derived from inactivated virus-pellets, thus completing the repository of high-resolution structures for all SAT serotypes.

We developed novel assays to assess the relative stability of the core in HIV- 1 virions. Using these assays, we examined the role of Vif in the stability of the HIV- 1 core. The integrity of the core was examined following virion permeabilization or removal of the lipid envelope and treatment with various triggers, including S 100 cytosol, deoxynucleoside triphosphates, detergents, NaCl, and buffers of different pH to mimic aspects of the <b>uncoating</b> and disassembly <b>process</b> which occurs after virus entry but preceding or during reverse transcription. vif mutant cores were more sensitive to disruption by all triggers tested than wild-type cores, as determined by endogenous reverse transcriptase (RT) assays, biochemical analyses, and electron microscopy.

Purified cores could be isolated from wild-type but not vif mutant virions by sedimentation through detergent-treated gradients. These results demonstrate that Vif increases the stability of virion cores.

An in vitro based assay using soluble coatomer and ARF 1 together with synthetic liposomes containing p 23 tail peptide yielded generation of COPI vesicles, thus establishing the minimal requirements for COPI coat assembly (Bremser et al., 1999). In a program to reconstitute one round of budding, uncoating and fusion of a COPI vesicle from defined components, {{the next step is}} to include in a liposomal system the components needed for the fusion reaction. For that purpose, SNAREs (Soluble N-Ethylmaleimid-sensitive fusion protein Attachment protein REceptors) were required since they were shown to be the machinery for fusion (McNew et al., 2000; Nickel et al., 1999; Sollner et al., 1993; Weber et al., 1998)). To study their behavior in the COPI budding process, different ER and Golgi SNAREs (Sec 22 p, Vti 1 p, Gos 1 p, Bos 1 p, Bet 1 p, Ykt 6 p) were produced in bacteria, purified and reconstituted into liposomes in their correct physiological orientation. Sec 22 p and Vti 1 p do not seem to be preferentially taken up in COPI coated vesicles under the conditions of the in vitro budding assay. Preliminary data allowed reconstitution of SNARE complexes and further experiments should allow the study of the mechanisms involved in their specific uptake in COPI vesicles. Prior to fusion, vesicles need to be <b>uncoated.</b> This <b>process</b> was shown to be dependent on ARF 1 -GTP hydrolysis (Tanigawa et al., 1993), a reaction catalyzed by ARF-GTPase activating protein (ARF-GAP). Therefore myristoylated yeast ARF 1 p as well as its ARF-GAP (Glo 3 p) was produced in bacteria, purified to apparent homogeneity and in an active state with regard to exchange of nucleotide and GTP hydrolysis in presence of liposomes. Moreover, selecting for large size liposomes used in the in vitro budding assay was critical to ensure newly formed vesicles are authentic ones and not preexisting small structures. Therefore, gel filtration experiments were successfully used to achieve this goal. Tools were provided to reconstitute one round of vesicular transport in vitro. Active proteins (ARF 1 p, coatomer) involved in coat assembly, ARF-GAP required for uncoating and the fusion machinery proteins SNAREs were provided. A Homogenous population of large liposomes was generated so that the total signal observed after budding is due only to de novo generated COPI vesicles and not to preexisting small structures...|$|R

40|$|The {{acquired}} immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) {{has caused}} over 60 million deaths since the etiological agent, {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1), was first discovered in 1981. Over 6000 new HIV- 1 infections are reported every day, predominantly in economically deprived regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Despite impressive developments in antiretroviral therapy, current medical intervention is unable to prevent or cure HIV- 1 infection, necessitating expensive life-long treatment. Difficulties in establishing a vaccine or cure, arise from its capacity to cause life-long latent infection, and its extraordinary ability to evolve resistance to therapeutic intervention. Capsid <b>uncoating</b> is the <b>process</b> by which p 24 CA proteins (CA) disassemble from the viral ribonucleoprotein during the early phase of the HIV- 1 lifecycle. Despite intensive investigation, much is yet unknown about the spatial and temporal occurrence of this process within the cell, and the viral or host cellular factors involved. However, studies investigating p 24 CA mutations which alter the stability, and consequently the kinetics of capsid uncoating, have shown that timely capsid uncoating is crucial for efficient HIV- 1 infection. Recent advancements in microscopic techniques have enabled high resolution analysis of cellular protein interactions, including the in situ localisation and dynamics of these events. We have developed three imaging techniques {{for the analysis of}} different aspects of HIV- 1 capsid uncoating: 1) a dual-fluorescently labelled virus 2) a fluorescently labelled antibody targeting a capsid internalised repeat peptide array, and 3) a split-luciferase system tagging an internalised component of the capsid core. Fluorescent labelling of both the CA and IN proteins enabled the sensitive and specific analysis of uncoating in response to both restriction factors and CA mutations, and the visualisation of CA colocalised pre-integration complexes (PICs) within the nucleus. This system is ideally suited for studying the longer-term kinetics of uncoating, and the in-situ visualisation of protein interactions. The use of the repeat peptide array in conjunction with fluorescently labelled antibodies, reinforced reports of an initial uncoating event early after viral fusion. This system enabled the rapid and reproducible imaging of uncoating events in real-time, within the same cell sample population. Finally, the split-luciferase system added further weight to a primary early uncoating stage, and showed capsid disassembly responses specific to mutations within the p 24 CA that affect the stability of the viral core. Put together, these three assays support a model of uncoating involving an initial early phase of uncoating, followed by a more gradual disassembly of CA from the PICs during cytoplasmic trafficking towards the nucleus. The colocalisation of these components within the nucleus suggests incomplete uncoating at the time of nuclear docking. The user-friendliness of the split-luciferase system, along with its capacity for high-throughput, real-time analysis, support great potential for its use as a screening assay for testing antiviral compounds targeting capsid uncoating events. ...|$|R

Custom made FB system consisted of a fluidization column, 1. 2 m in height with a square cross section of 400 mm made from stainless steel, a section for air flux homogenization and a porous plate distributor. The air feed was provided by a blower. A flow meter, a hygrometer and a thermocouple set were also used to monitor the process and to assure optimal environmental conditions (Q = 650 m 3 /h, T = 20 °C, RH = 40 %). Aluminum substrates were mounted on a rotating shaft (Rotating speed = 1 Hz). Four samples have been prepared with processing times ranging from thirty minutes to four hours (table 2) {{in order to understand}} the effect of process time on the tribological and corrosion resistant properties. Processing times were chosen on the basis of mass growth preliminary tests. The corrosion behaviour of the Al 2 O 3 coatings was investigated in NaCl solution (3 % and 0. 5 %). by means of Open Circuit Potential (O. C. P), Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), Localized Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (LEIS) and Electrochemical Noise Analysis (ENA). Blank corrosion tests were performed on <b>uncoated</b> substrate. FB <b>process</b> allowed to coat aluminium alloy substrates with a tough and well-adherent Al 2 O 3 coating as evidenced by microindentation and scratch tests. Figure 1 shows OCP trend for samples 2 and 4. A 20 mV decreasing was detected after 6 days of immersion and it may be presumably connected to the onset of a corrosion attack. Very similar trends were detected for all samples. EIS spectra, evaluated by the use of equivalent circuits, evidenced an increasing of charge transfer resistance (Rct) with immersion time, as shown in figure 2 for sample 2. Figure 3 reports a comparison between the Rct trend of sample 2 and 4 that showed the best and the worst behaviour of all samples. Rct values for the blank test are also reported. The slight increase in Rct observed at the end of tests, is given by the occlusion of the pores by corrosion products. LEIS is a new electrochemical technique that, using a 5 electrodes configuration and a motorized probe, permits to acquire impedance maps of coating surface, able to reveal local degradation events. Figures 4 reports impedance maps of sample 3 at two different immersion times. Maps evidenced the presence of a defect on coating (Fig. 4 a) and followed by the onset of a pit (Fig. 4 b). The analysis of noise acquisition confirmed the findings of EIS and LEIS. Figures 5 report the potential standard deviation (a) trend of samples 1 and 4. Sample 1 showed strong fluctuations representative of a transient stage at the beginning of test. The further reduction of fluctuation amplitude indicates a good behavior of the sample. Sample 4 confirmed the poor corrosion resistance features. ENA permitted to discriminate three stages (Fig. 5 b). The first stage takes place in the first 10 days of test and is due to the permeation of solution through pore coating. During the second stage, between 10 th and 15 th day the onset of a pitting attack occurred. The third stage, from 15 th day until the end of test a pit propagation took place. Current Power Spectral Density (PSD) obtained by the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) confirmed the occurrence of a pit attack (Fig. 6 e 7).

40|$|Two human {{rhinovirus}} serotypes complexed with two- and five-domain soluble {{fragments of}} the cellular receptor, intercellular adhesion molecule- 1, have been investigated by X-ray crystallographic analyses of the individual components and by cryo-electron microscopy of the complexes. The three-dimensional image reconstructions provide a molecular envelope within which the crystal structures of the viruses and the receptor fragments can be positioned with accuracy. The N-terminal domain of the receptor binds to the rhinovirus 'canyon' surrounding the icosahedral 5 -fold axes. Fitting of molecular models into the image reconstruction density identified the residues on the virus that interact with those on the receptor surface, demonstrating complementarity of the electrostatic patterns for {{the tip of the}} N-terminal receptor domain and the floor of the canyon.

40|$|SummaryThe yeast Dsl 1 p vesicle {{tethering}} complex, {{comprising the}} three subunits Dsl 1 p, Dsl 3 p, and Tip 20 p, is stably associated with three endoplasmic reticulum-localized Q-SNAREs and {{is believed to}} {{play a central role}} in the tethering and fusion of Golgi-derived COP-I transport vesicles. Dsl 1 p also interacts directly with COP-I subunits. We now show that binding of Dsl 1 p to COP-I subunits involves binding sites identical to those involved in interactions between COP-I subunits that stabilize the COP-I coat. Cells with defects in Dsl/SNARE complex function show massive accumulation of COP-I-coated vesicles in a cluster to which COP-II coat proteins are also recruited. Our results suggest that binding of Dsl/SNARE complex to the COP-I coat complex serves two functions: to mediate vesicle tethering and to assist the <b>uncoating</b> <b>process</b> by blocking domains in COP-I that drive repolymerization and the formation of large COP-I aggregates...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe human {{respiratory}} syncytial virus (HRSV) structural P protein, phosphorylated at serine (S) and threonine (T) residues, is a co-factor of viral RNA polymerase. The phosphorylation of S 54 {{is controlled}} by the coordinated action of two cellular enzymes: a lithium-sensitive kinase, probably glycogen synthetase kinase (GSK- 3) β and protein phosphatase 2 A (PP 2 A). Inhibition of lithium-sensitive kinase, soon after infection, blocks the viral growth cycle by inhibiting synthesis and/or accumulation of viral RNAs, proteins and extracellular particles. P protein phosphorylation at S 54 is required to liberate viral ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) from M protein, during the <b>uncoating</b> <b>process.</b> Kinase inhibition, late in infection, produces a decrease in genomic RNA and infectious viral particles. LiCl, intranasally applied to mice infected with HRSV A 2 strain, reduces the number of mice with virus in their lungs and the virus titre. Administration of LiCl to humans via aerosol should prevent HRSV infection, without secondary effects...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} echoviruses use decay {{accelerating}} factor (DAF) as a cellular receptor or attachment protein for cell infection. Binding of echovirus 7 to DAF at the cell surface, {{but not to}} soluble DAF in solution, triggers the formation of virus particles exhibiting an altered sedimentation coefficient (‘A ’ particles) which are considered indicative of the particle <b>uncoating</b> <b>process.</b> We have previously demonstrated that antibodies to b 2 -microglobulin block cell infection at a stage prior to ‘A ’ particle formation and suggested that this reflects the involvement of b 2 -microglobulin (or the associated MHC-I) in a virus–receptor complex that forms at the cell surface. We demonstrate here that antiserum to CD 59 specifically blocks infection of rhabdomyosarcoma cells by a range of echoviruses, including viruses that bind DAF (e. g. echovirus 7) and those that use currently unidentified receptors other than DAF. The block occurs prior to ‘A ’ particle formation and is cell-type specific. The potential role of CD 59 as an active member, or passive participant, in the virus–receptor complex is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Influenza A viruses have broad host tropism, {{being able}} to infect a range of hosts from wild fowl to swine to humans. This broad tropism makes highly {{pathogenic}} influenza A strains, such as H 5 N 1, potentially dangerous to humans if they gain the ability to jump from an animal reservoir to humans. How influenza A viruses are able to jump the species barrier is incompletely understood due to the complex genetic nature of the viral surface glycoprotein, hemagglutinin, which mediates entry, combined with the virus's ability to use various receptor linkages. Current therapeutics against influenza A include those that target the <b>uncoating</b> <b>process</b> after entry {{as well as those}} that prevent viral budding. While there are therapeutics in development that target entry, currently there are none clinically available. We review here the genetics of influenza A viruses that contribute to entry tropism, how these genetic alterations may contribute to receptor usage and species tropism, as well as how novel therapeutics can be developed that target the major surface glycoprotein, hemagglutinin...|$|E
30|$|In summary, helices α 5 and α 7 act as gatekeepers for {{enforcing}} a pH dependent {{opening and}} closing of the tunnel. Notably, although the tunnel is predominately hydrophobic, the top half is lined {{by a number of}} hydrophilic residues that are exposed to the solvent and is large enough to accommodate fatty acid molecules like sphingosine (Fig. S 1 C–E). A fatty acid-like molecule known as the “pocket factor” [presumed to be sphingosine in EV 71 (Wang et al., 2012)] was shown to bind into a hydrophobic pocket beneath the canyon of EVs (Rossmann et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2012). Receptor binding at the canyon dislodges this viral “pocket factor” from the capsid protein and initiates uncoating (Ren et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2008). Since EV 71 uncoating occurs under acidic conditions, it is conceivable that acidic conditions first convert the lipid transfer tunnel of SCARB 2 from a closed form as seen in nSCARB 2 to an open form as observed in aSCARB 2, permitting SCARB 2 to suck the “pocket factor” from the viral capsid and thus initiate the <b>uncoating</b> <b>process</b> of EV 71.|$|E
40|$|Background: The matrix 1 (M 1) protein of Influenza A virus plays many {{critical}} roles {{throughout the}} virus life cycle. The oligomerization of M 1 {{is essential for}} the formation of the viral matrix layer during the assembly and budding process. Methodology/Principal Findings: In the present study, we report that M 1 can oligomerize in vitro, and that the oligomerization is pH-dependent. The N-terminal domain of M 1 alone exists as multiple-order oligomers at pH 7. 4, and the C-terminal domain alone forms an exclusively stable dimer. As a result, intact M 1 can display different forms of oligomers and dimer is the smallest oligomerization state, at neutral pH. At pH 5. 0, oligomers of the N-terminal domain completely dissociate into monomers, while the C-terminal domain remains in dimeric form. As a result, oligomers of intact M 1 dissociate into a stable dimer at acidic pH. Conclusions/Significance: Oligomerization of M 1 involves both the N- and C-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain determines the pH-dependent oligomerization characteristic, and C-terminal domain forms a stable dimer, which contributes to the dimerization of M 1. The present study will help to unveil the mechanisms of influenza A virus assembly and <b>uncoating</b> <b>process...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{triggering}} {{mechanism for}} interferon synthesis in mouse peritoneal macro-phages and chick embryo (CE) cells by Newcastle disease virus (NDV) exposed to hydroxylamine orhomologous antiserum {{was investigated in}} relation to the intra-cellular fate of these agents. Inactivation of NDV at 22 aC by I M-hydroxylamine proceeded with first-order kinetics, whereas the interferon-inducing capacity of hydroxylamine-treated virus in macrophages was unimpaired. In contrast o infective NDV, hydroxylamine-inactivated virus produced interferon in CE cells, and such a virus still had partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. Hydroxylamine-inactivated NDV was adsorbed to and uncoated in both normal and chloroquine diphosphate reat-ed cells, but no viral double-stranded RNA was detected. Hydroxylamine treat-ment of virion-extracted RNA and neutralization of intact virions by antibody abolished the capacity of the virus to induce interferon. Infective as well as neutra-lized NDV interacted with macrophages to the same degree, but association be-tween NDV and CE cells was prevented by antibody-coating. In macrophages, the RNA of neutralized NDV became more sensitive to RNase than RNA of infective NDV, but this process was inhibited in chloroquine diphosphate-treated cells. These results suggest that interferon induction by NDV involves components of the virion which'iare~present up to the regular <b>uncoating</b> <b>process...</b>|$|E
