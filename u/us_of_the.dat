5|$|Stossel {{has criticized}} {{government}} programs for being inefficient, wasteful, and harmful. He has also criticized the American legal system, opining {{that it provides}} lawyers and vexatious litigators the incentive to file frivolous lawsuits indiscriminately. Stossel contends that these suits often generate more wealth for lawyers than for deserving clients, stifle innovation and personal freedoms, and cause harm to private citizens, taxpayers, consumers and businesses. Although Stossel concedes that some lawsuits are {{necessary in order to}} provide justice to people genuinely injured by others with greater economic power, he advocates the adoption in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English rule as one method to reduce the more abusive or frivolous lawsuits.|$|E
5|$|Oliphant {{took the}} {{initiative}} himself to enlighten the scientific community in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recent ground breaking discoveries the MAUD Committee had just exposed. Oliphant also travelled to Berkley to with meet with Ernest Lawrence, inventor of the cyclotron. After Oliphant informed Lawrence of his report on uranium, Lawrence met with NDRC chairman James Bryant Conant, George B. Pegram, and Arthur Compton to relay the details which Oliphant had directed to Lawrence. Oliphant was not only {{able to get in}} touch with Lawrence, but he met with Conant and Bush to inform them of the significant data the MAUD had discovered. Oliphant’s ability to inform the Americans led to Oliphant convincing Lawrence, Lawrence convincing Compton, and then Kistiakowsky convincing Conant to move forward with nuclear weapons. These actions from Oliphant resulted in Bush taking this report directly to the president.|$|E

25|$|The {{money supply}} {{of a country}} is usually held to be {{the total amount of}} {{currency}} in circulation plus the total value of checking and savings deposits in the commercial banks in the country.

25|$|The {{publication}} {{of this book}} may {{be regarded as the}} first move towards the widespread adoption of the social model of disability in regard to these types of disabilities, and was the impetus for the development of government strategies for desegregation.Successful lawsuits against governments and an increasing awareness of human rights and self-advocacy also contributed to this process, resulting in the passing in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act in 1980.|$|E
25|$|Some {{forms of}} copper are not soluble in stomach acids and cannot be absorbed from the stomach or small intestine. Also, some foods may contain indigestible fiber that binds with copper. High intakes of zinc can {{significantly}} decrease copper absorption. Extreme intakes of Vitamin C or iron can also affect copper absorption, reminding <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fact that micronutrients {{need to be}} consumed as a balanced mixture. This {{is one reason why}} extreme intakes of any one single micronutrient are not advised. Individuals with chronic digestive problems may be unable to absorb sufficient amounts of copper, even though the foods they eat are copper-rich.|$|E

25|$|The genomes of HSV-1 and HSV-2 {{are complex}} and contain two unique regions called the long unique region (UL) and the short unique region (<b>US).</b> <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> 74 known ORFs, UL {{contains}} 56 viral genes, whereas US contains only 12. Transcription of HSV genes is catalyzed by RNA polymerase II of the infected host. Immediate early genes, which encode proteins that regulate the expression of early and late viral genes, {{are the first to}} be expressed following infection. Early gene expression follows, to allow the synthesis of enzymes involved in DNA replication and the production of certain envelope glycoproteins. Expression of late genes occurs last; this group of genes predominantly encode proteins that form the virion particle.|$|E
25|$|But, {{whatever}} {{might be}} Shaftesbury's speculative opinions or his mode of expressing them, all witnesses bear {{testimony to the}} elevation and purity {{of his life and}} aims. As an earnest student, and ardent lover of liberty, an enthusiast in the cause of virtue, and a man of unblemished life and untiring beneficence, Shaftesbury probably had no superior in his generation. His character and pursuits are the more remarkable, considering the rank of life in which he was born and the circumstances under which he was brought up. In many respects he reminds <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stoic philosopher and Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, whose works he studied with avidity, and whose influence is stamped upon his own productions.|$|E

Clarkson and the prominent abolitionist Quaker William Allen were to the left, the main axis of interest. In 1846 Clarkson was host to Frederick Douglass, an American former slave who had escaped to freedom in the North and became a prominent abolitionist, on his first visit to England. Douglass spoke at numerous meetings and attracted considerable attention and support. At risk after passage in the <b>US</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, Douglass was grateful when British friends raised the money and negotiated purchase of his freedom from his former master.|$|E
