5000|$|Abnormal cooling rates {{occur in}} {{supercooled}} magmas, particularly komatiite lavas. Here, low nucleation rates due to superfluidity prevent nucleation <b>until</b> the <b>liquid</b> <b>is</b> {{well below the}} mineral growth curve. Growth then occurs at extreme rates, favoring slender, long crystals. Additionally, at crystal vertices and terminations, spikes and skeletal shapes may form because nucleation favors crystal edges. [...] or [...] texture {{is an example of}} this result. Hence, the shape of phenocrysts can provide valuable information on cooling rate and initial magma temperature.|$|R
5000|$|Red fuming {{nitric acid}} (RFNA) is a {{storable}} oxidizer used as a rocket propellant. It consists of 84% nitric acid (...) , 13% dinitrogen tetroxide and 1-2% water. The color of red {{fuming nitric acid}} {{is due to the}} dinitrogen tetroxide, which breaks down partially to form nitrogen dioxide. The nitrogen dioxide dissolves <b>until</b> the <b>liquid</b> <b>is</b> saturated, and evaporates off into fumes with a suffocating odor. RFNA increases the flammability of combustible materials and is highly exothermic when reacting with water.|$|R

50|$|Inking of {{the stamp}} occurs through the {{application}} of a thiol solution either by immersion or coating the stamp with a Q-tip. The highly hydrophobic PDMS material allows the ink to be diffused into the bulk of the stamp, which means the thiols reside not only on the surface, but also in the bulk of the stamp material. This diffusion into the bulk creates an ink reservoir for multiple prints. The stamp is let dry <b>until</b> no <b>liquid</b> <b>is</b> visible and an ink reservoir is created.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{the hose}} {{attaches}} {{to the bottom of}} the bladder, in order to let the last of the liquid into the hose, air that reaches the opening bubbles to the top of the bladder, and is trapped there <b>until</b> the <b>liquid</b> <b>is</b> nearly drained. Each time more air is blown into the bladder than the amount of liquid contained inside the hose, the pressure inside the bladder increases, and the more effort blowing back involves. Therefore, the technique profits from enough attention to develop a sense of when the hose is nearly full of air.|$|R

50|$|Nimono (煮物) is a simmered dish in Japanese cuisine. A nimono {{generally}} {{consists of}} a base ingredient simmered in shiru stock flavored with sake, soy sauce, and {{a small amount of}} sweetening. The nimono is simmered in the shiru {{over a period of time}} <b>until</b> the <b>liquid</b> <b>is</b> absorbed into the base ingredient or evaporated. The base ingredients for a nimono is typically a vegetable, fish, seafood, or tofu, either singly, or in combination. The shiru stock for a nimono is generally dashi. Other than sake and soy sauce, the stock can be further flavored by mirin, sugar, salt, vinegar, miso, or other condiments. A heavy covered pot is used in making nimono in order to spread the heat evenly throughout the ingredients during the simmering process.|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundMechanical {{stapling}} {{method is}} widely established alternative to conventional hand suturing. MethodFor gastrointestinal anastomoses. In this study, we compare the clinical results of mechanical stapling {{with those of}} hand suturing for gastrojejunostomy and jejunojejunostomy after Subtotal Stomach Preserving Pancreaticojejunostomy (SSPPD). MethodsBetween 2002 and 2007, 42 patients who underwent SSPPD with concise records on operative procedure and time required for gastrojejunostomy and jejunojejunostomy were enrolled. Out of 42 patients, the mechanical stapling for gastrojejunostomy and jejunojejunostomy after SSPPD was performed for 19 patients and hand suturing for those in SSPPD was done for 23 patients. ResultsAll clinical characteristics were similar in both groups. There was no statistical difference between both groups {{in the rate of}} complications related to gastrojejunostomy and jejunojejunostomy. However, days of nasogastric intubation and days <b>until</b> <b>liquid</b> diet in the stapled group were significantly shorter than those in the hand sutured group. Time required for gastrojejunostomy and jejunojejunostomy was significantly shorter in the stapled group than in the hand sutured group. ConclusionsThis study suggested that stapled anastomoses might require a shorter time to perform and decreased time for nasogastric intubation and <b>until</b> <b>liquid</b> diet <b>is</b> introduced...|$|R
30|$|Generated liquid {{products}} (C 15 + compounds) {{were collected by}} dichloromethane (DCM) extraction of solid residues after pyrolysis. In a typical procedure, the gold tubes were cut in a glass bottle, weighed as G 0, with dichloromethane (DCM). The bottle was ultrasonicated twice for 3  min until the solvent and residues were totally separated. Then, we carefully filtered the solvent into another glass bottle, which was weighed as G 1, through the chromatographic membrane several times <b>until</b> the <b>liquid</b> <b>was</b> clean. After the volatilization of DCM in both two bottles, we weighed each glass bottle again, recorded as G 2 and G 3. The differences between G 2 and G 0 as well as G 3 and G 1 were due to C 15 + compounds and solid residues after the pyrolysis, respectively (He et al. 2011 a).|$|R
25|$|As a hard, rigid solid {{in the dry}} state, soil {{becomes a}} crumbly (friable) semisolid when a certain {{moisture}} content, termed the shrinkage limit, is reached. If it is an expansive soil, this soil will also begin to swell in volume as this moisture content is exceeded. Increasing the water content beyond the soil's plastic limit will transform it into a malleable, plastic mass, which causes additional swelling. The soil will remain in this plastic state <b>until</b> its <b>liquid</b> limit <b>is</b> exceeded, which causes it to transform into a viscous liquid that flows when jarred.|$|R
30|$|Following IRB {{approval}} and registration (NCT 00930696), a trial {{was performed in}} 20 women in whom a full thickness resection for deep endometriosis was performed at the University Hospital Gasthuisberg, University of Leuven, Belgium. The only exclusion criterion was concomitant diseases jeopardising the outcome of surgery. Following informed consent of the patient and randomisation by the trial nurse using sealed envelopes, lavage was performed either as done routinely or <b>until</b> the <b>liquid</b> <b>was</b> clear. In order to standardise lavage during this trial, either 0.5 or 8  L of warmed saline was used. Using CONSORT guidelines, all women scheduled to undergo deep endometriosis surgery consented to participate; 20 women were randomised during surgery; there were no losses to follow up, and all 20 women were analysed. The endpoints of the trial were CRP concentrations and white blood cell count, the clinical follow-up and eventual postoperative complications.|$|R
