50|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of adenomyosis {{still remains}} unclear, but {{the functioning of}} the inner myometrium, also called the junction zone (JZ), is believed {{to play a major role}} in the development of adenomyosis. It is also a matter of discussion whether the link between reproductive disorders and major obstetrical disorders also lies here. Parity, age, and previous <b>uterine</b> <b>abrasion</b> increase the risk of adenomyosis. Hormonal factors such as local hyperestrogenism and elevated levels of s-prolactin as well as autoimmune factors have also been identified as possible risk factors. As both the myometrium and stroma in an adenomyosis affected uterus show significant differences from those of a non-affected uterus, a complex origin that includes multifactorial changes on both genetic and biochemical levels is likely.|$|E
40|$|Post {{surgical}} adhesions (PSAs) are {{an inevitable}} outcome of surgery and their presence leads to pathogeneses and significant economic impact. The studies within this thesis utilised standard and reproducible abrasion models, in rabbits, pigs and rats, {{to investigate the}} formation and maturation of PSAs with strict quantitative analyses. These {{studies have shown that}} the development of PSAs is a series of complex, multi-factorial processes. PSA development can be classified into two stages: (i) PSA modelling occurring up to/including 16 hours post injury characterised by the inflammatory response and fibrin deposition and maturation; and (ii) PSA remodelling occurring from 16 hours onwards and characterised by tissue repair, collagen deposition and maturation and chemical mediation by TGF-P. Treatment with VivostatTm System Derived (novel) Fibrin Sealant significantly reduced the formation of PSAs with mean PSA reduction of 80 % for the rabbit <b>uterine</b> hom <b>abrasion</b> model, from 3 separate studies; 83 % for the pig stomach/colon/caecurn abrasion model, from 2 separate studies; 80 % for the rat caecum abrasion model.
