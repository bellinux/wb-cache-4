5|$|In April 1972, the Apollo 16 mission {{recorded}} various astronomical {{photos and}} spectra in <b>ultraviolet</b> with the Far <b>Ultraviolet</b> Camera/Spectrograph.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ultraviolet</b> {{astronomy}} employs <b>ultraviolet</b> wavelengths between approximately 100 and 3200Å (10 to 320nm). Light {{at those}} wavelengths are {{absorbed by the}} Earth's atmosphere, requiring observations at these wavelengths to be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space. <b>Ultraviolet</b> astronomy is best suited {{to the study of}} thermal radiation and spectral emission lines from hot blue stars (OB stars) that are very bright in this wave band. This includes the blue stars in other galaxies, which have been the targets of several <b>ultraviolet</b> surveys. Other objects commonly observed in <b>ultraviolet</b> light include planetary nebulae, supernova remnants, and active galactic nuclei. However, as <b>ultraviolet</b> light is easily absorbed by interstellar dust, an adjustment of <b>ultraviolet</b> measurements is necessary.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ultraviolet</b> telescopes make {{observations}} at <b>ultraviolet</b> wavelengths, i.e. between approximately 10 and 320 nm. Light {{at these}} wavelengths is {{absorbed by the}} Earth's atmosphere, so observations at these wavelengths must be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space. Objects emitting <b>ultraviolet</b> radiation include the Sun, other stars and galaxies.|$|E
5|$|All {{images from}} Hubble are {{monochromatic}} grayscale, in which its cameras incorporate {{a variety of}} filters each passing specific wavelengths of light. Color images are created by combining separate monochrome images taken through different filters. This process can also create false-color versions of images including infrared and <b>ultraviolet</b> channels, where infrared is typically rendered as a deep red and <b>ultraviolet</b> is rendered as a deep blue.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds exhibit fluorescence, that is, they emit {{light of}} various colors and intensities under long-wave <b>ultraviolet</b> light (365nm): Cape series stones (type Ia) usually fluoresce blue, and these stones may also phosphoresce yellow, a unique {{property}} among gemstones. Other possible long-wave fluorescence colors are green (usually in brown stones), yellow, mauve, or red (in type IIb diamonds). In natural diamonds, there is typically {{little if any}} response to short-wave <b>ultraviolet,</b> but {{the reverse is true}} of synthetic diamonds. Some natural type IIb diamonds phosphoresce blue after exposure to short-wave <b>ultraviolet.</b> In natural diamonds, fluorescence under X-rays is generally bluish-white, yellowish or greenish. Some diamonds, particularly Canadian diamonds, show no fluorescence.|$|E
5|$|Little {{more was}} {{discovered}} about Venus until the 20thcentury. Its almost featureless disc gave no hint what its surface might be like, {{and it was}} only with the development of spectroscopic, radar and <b>ultraviolet</b> observations that more of its secrets were revealed. The first <b>ultraviolet</b> observations were carried out in the 1920s, when Frank E. Ross found that <b>ultraviolet</b> photographs revealed considerable detail that was absent in visible and infrared radiation. He suggested this was due to a dense, yellow lower atmosphere with high cirrus clouds above it.|$|E
5|$|Many birds show plumage {{patterns}} in <b>ultraviolet</b> that are {{invisible to the}} human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar {{to the naked eye}} are distinguished by the presence of <b>ultraviolet</b> reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an <b>ultraviolet</b> reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. <b>Ultraviolet</b> light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. With the exception of pigeons and a few other species, the eyelids of birds are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten.|$|E
5|$|Pr3+ ions {{are used}} as {{activators}} in some red, green, blue, and <b>ultraviolet</b> phosphors.|$|E
5|$|UV ranges {{listed at}} <b>Ultraviolet</b> astronomy#Ultraviolet space telescopes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ultraviolet</b> and X-ray telescopes {{can observe}} highly {{energetic}} galactic phenomena. <b>Ultraviolet</b> flares are sometimes observed when {{a star in}} a distant galaxy is torn apart from the tidal forces of a nearby black hole. The distribution of hot gas in galactic clusters can be mapped by X-rays. The existence of supermassive black holes at the cores of galaxies was confirmed through X-ray astronomy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ultraviolet</b> {{radiation}} from the Sun breaks water molecules apart, {{reducing the amount of}} water available to form noctilucent clouds. The radiation is known to vary cyclically with the solar cycle and satellites have been tracking the decrease in brightness of the clouds with the increase of <b>ultraviolet</b> radiation for the last two solar cycles. It has been found that changes in the clouds follow changes in the intensity of <b>ultraviolet</b> rays by about a year, but the reason for this long lag is not yet known.|$|E
5|$|Boron-doped {{diamonds}} transmit light down to ~250nm {{and absorb}} some red and infrared light (hence the blue color); they may phosphoresce blue after exposure to shortwave <b>ultraviolet</b> light. Apart from optical absorption, boron acceptors {{have been detected}} by electron paramagnetic resonance.|$|E
5|$|Both NAD and NADH {{strongly}} absorb <b>ultraviolet</b> light {{because of}} the adenine. For example, peak absorption of NAD is at a wavelength of 259nanometers (nm), with an extinction coefficient of 16,900M−1cm−1. NADH also absorbs at higher wavelengths, with a second peak in UV absorption at 339nm with an extinction coefficient of 6,220M−1cm−1. This difference in the <b>ultraviolet</b> absorption spectra between the oxidized and reduced forms of the coenzymes at higher wavelengths makes it simple to measure the conversion of one to another in enzyme assays– by measuring the amount of UV absorption at 340nm using a spectrophotometer.|$|E
5|$|Cosmetics {{testing on}} animals is {{particularly}} controversial. Such tests, {{which are still}} conducted in the U.S., involve general toxicity, eye and skin irritancy, phototoxicity (toxicity triggered by <b>ultraviolet</b> light) and mutagenicity.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{atmosphere}} is very effective at absorbing high energy electromagnetic radiation such as x-rays and gamma rays, so {{these types of}} radiation would not reach any dangerous levels at the surface during the burst event itself. The immediate effect on life on Earth from a GRB within a few parsecs would only be a short increase in <b>ultraviolet</b> radiation at ground level, lasting from {{less than a second}} to tens of seconds. This <b>ultraviolet</b> radiation could potentially reach dangerous levels depending on the exact nature and distance of the burst, but it seems unlikely to be able to cause a global catastrophe for life on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{brief summary}} of the {{experimental}} crises (such as the <b>ultraviolet</b> catastrophe) which motivated quantum theory, Herbert identifies four major formulations of quantum theory: Werner Heisenberg's matrix mechanics, Erwin Schrödinger's wave mechanics, Paul Dirac's transformation theory, and Richard Feynman's sum-over-histories formulation.|$|E
5|$|Fred Hoyle and Chandra Wickramasinghe later {{proposed}} {{the identification of}} bicyclic aromatic compounds from {{an analysis of the}} <b>ultraviolet</b> extinction absorption at 2175Å, thus demonstrating the existence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules in space.|$|E
5|$|Gemological {{laboratories}} {{make use}} of spectrophotometer machines that can distinguish natural, artificial, and color-enhanced diamonds. The spectrophotometers analyze the infrared, visible, and <b>ultraviolet</b> absorption and luminescence spectra of diamonds cooled with liquid nitrogen to detect tell-tale absorption lines that are not normally discernible.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Mariner 10 swung by Venus {{on its way}} to Mercury {{and took}} <b>ultraviolet</b> {{photographs}} of the clouds, revealing the extraordinarily high wind speeds in the Venusian atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that microbes at this level could be soaking up <b>ultraviolet</b> light from the Sun {{as a source of}} energy, which could be a possible explanation for dark patches seen on UV images of the planet. Large, non-spherical cloud particles have also been detected in the cloud decks. In 2012, the abundance and vertical distribution of these unknown <b>ultraviolet</b> absorbers in the Venusian atmosphere have been investigated from analysis of Venus Monitoring Camera images, but their composition is still unknown. In 2016, disulfur dioxide has been identified as a possible candidate for causing the so far unknown UV absorption of the Venusian atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|It {{was quickly}} {{realized}} that a glass dispersive prism was not suitable {{for use in the}} <b>ultraviolet</b> spectrum. Glass absorbed electromagnetic radiation below 400 millimicrons rather than dispersing it. In the Model B, a quartz prism was substituted for the earlier glass.|$|E
5|$|Its {{climate is}} cold, dry and very sunny, {{with high levels}} of <b>ultraviolet</b> radiation. Licancabur is not covered by glaciers, and {{vegetation}} such as cushion plants and shrubs are found lower on its slopes. Chinchillas were formerly hunted on the volcano.|$|E
5|$|Many {{animals have}} dark {{pigments}} such as melanin in their skin, eyes and fur {{to protect themselves}} against sunburn (damage to living tissues caused by <b>ultraviolet</b> light).|$|E
5|$|Other {{identified}} triggers include local {{injury to}} the face, lips, eyes, or mouth; trauma; surgery; radiotherapy; and exposure to wind, <b>ultraviolet</b> light, or sunlight.|$|E
5|$|The GHRS was a {{spectrograph}} {{designed to}} operate in the <b>ultraviolet.</b> It was built by the Goddard Space Flight Center and could achieve a spectral resolution of 90,000. Also optimized for <b>ultraviolet</b> observations were the FOC and FOS, which were capable of the highest spatial resolution of any instruments on Hubble. Rather than CCDs these three instruments used photon-counting digicons as their detectors. The FOC was constructed by ESA, while the University of California, San Diego, and Martin Marietta Corporation built the FOS.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground state}} energy {{level of the}} {{electron}} in a hydrogen atom is −13.6eV, which is equivalent to an <b>ultraviolet</b> photon of roughly 91nm wavelength.|$|E
5|$|The {{individual}} {{cells in}} a plasma display contain {{a mixture of}} xenon and neon ionized with electrodes. The interaction of this plasma with the electrodes generates <b>ultraviolet</b> photons, which then excite the phosphor coating {{on the front of}} the display.|$|E
5|$|The mission {{added two}} new {{instruments}} to Hubble. The first instrument, the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, {{is now the}} most sensitive <b>ultraviolet</b> spectrograph installed on the telescope. Its far-UV channel is 30 times more sensitive than previous instruments and the near-UV is twice as sensitive. The second instrument, the Wide Field Camera 3, is a panchromatic wide-field camera that can record {{a wide range of}} wavelengths, including infrared, visible, and <b>ultraviolet</b> light. Atlantis also carried the Soft-Capture Mechanism, which was installed onto the telescope.|$|E
5|$|The region's climate {{has been}} dry since the Tertiary. The area around Licancabur is {{dominated}} by year-round high pressure caused by the South Pacific High, giving it a very sunny climate. Because {{of the lack of}} moisture, solar radiation energy is dissipated primarily by wind. In the Llano de Chajnantor area, wind generally reaches its maximum strength during the day. Its prevailing direction is from the west, except in summer when winds are more variable. Because of the area's tropical location (where the ozone layer is thinner) and high altitude, it receives a large amount of <b>ultraviolet</b> radiation. The world's highest level of <b>ultraviolet</b> radiation was reported from Licancabur, although the high irradiation might have caused measurement artifacts.|$|E
5|$|The user {{could also}} switch between phototubes without {{removing}} the sample holder. A 1941 advertisement indicates that {{three types of}} phototubes were available, with maximum sensitivity to red, blue and <b>ultraviolet</b> light ranges.|$|E
5|$|The yellow {{stingray}} exhibits biofluorescence, that is, when {{illuminated by}} blue or <b>ultraviolet</b> light, it re-emits it as green, and appears differently than under white light illumination. Biofluorescence potentially assists intraspecific communication and camouflage.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ultraviolet</b> {{spectroscopy}} has wide applicability in molecular biology, {{particularly the}} study of photosynthesis. It {{has been used to}} study a wide variety of flowering plants and ferns by researchers in departments of biology, plant physiology and agriculture science as well as molecular genetics.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Planck, Einstein {{entertained the}} {{possibility}} that there might be actual physical quanta of light—what we now call photons. He noticed that a light quantum with energy proportional to its frequency would explain a number of troubling puzzles and paradoxes, including an unpublished law by Stokes, the <b>ultraviolet</b> catastrophe, and the photoelectric effect. Stokes's law said simply that the frequency of fluorescent light cannot be greater than the frequency of the light (usually <b>ultraviolet)</b> inducing it. Einstein eliminated the <b>ultraviolet</b> catastrophe by imagining a gas of photons behaving like a gas of electrons that he had previously considered. He was advised by a colleague to be careful how he wrote up this paper, in order to not challenge Planck, a powerful figure in physics, too directly, and indeed the warning was justified, as Planck never forgave him for writing it.|$|E
5|$|Upsilon Andromedae d {{lies in the}} {{habitable}} zone of Upsilon Andromedae A {{as defined}} both by the ability for an Earthlike world to retain liquid water at its surface {{and based on the}} amount of <b>ultraviolet</b> radiation received from the star.|$|E
5|$|Zinc oxide {{can be used}} in ointments, creams, and lotions {{to protect}} against sunburn and other damage to the skin caused by <b>ultraviolet</b> light (see sunscreen). It is the {{broadest}} spectrum UVA and UVB absorber that is approved for use as a sunscreen by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and is completely photostable. When used as an ingredient in sunscreen, zinc oxide blocks both UVA (320–400nm) and UVB (280–320nm) rays of <b>ultraviolet</b> light. Zinc oxide and the other most common physical sunscreen, titanium dioxide, are considered to be nonirritating, nonallergenic, and non-comedogenic. Zinc from zinc oxide is, however, slightly absorbed into the skin.|$|E
5|$|A young star such as Epsilon Eridani {{can produce}} {{large amounts of}} <b>ultraviolet</b> {{radiation}} that may be harmful to life. The orbital radius where the UV flux matches that on the early Earth lies at just under 0.5AU. Epsilon Eridani's proximity, Sun-like properties and suspected planets have made it a destination for interstellar travel in science fiction stories.|$|E
