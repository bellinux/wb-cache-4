Upconversion process occurs when two infrared photons are absorbed by rare-earth ions to generate a (high-energy) absorbable photon. As example, the energy transfer upconversion process (ETU), consists in successive transfer processes between excited ions in the near infrared. The <b>upconverter</b> material could be placed below the solar cell to absorb the infrared light that passes through the silicon. Useful ions are most commonly found in the trivalent state. [...] ions {{have been the most}} used. [...] ions absorb solar radiation around 1.54µm. Two [...] ions that have absorbed this radiation can interact with each other through an upconversion process. The excited ion emits light above the Si bandgap that is absorbed by the solar cell and creates an additional electron–hole pair that can generate current. However, the increased efficiency was small. In addition, fluoroindate glasses have low phonon energy and have been proposed as suitable matrix doped with [...] ions.|$|E

40|$|Upconversion is {{a unique}} optical {{property}} which is driven by a sequential photon pumping and generation of higher energy photons in a consecutive manner. The efficiency improvement in photovoltaic devices can be achieved when <b>upconverters</b> are integrated since <b>upconverters</b> contribute to the generation of extra photons. Despite numerous experimental studies confirming the relationship, fundamental explanations for a real contribution of upconversion to photovoltaic efficiency are still in demand. In this respect, we suggest {{a new approach to}} visualize the upconversion event in terms of surface photovoltage (SPV) by virtue of Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). One of the most conventional polymer semiconductors, poly(3 -hexyl thiophene) (P 3 HT), is employed as a sensitizer to generate charge carriers by upconverted light. KPFM measurements reveal that the light upconversion enabled the formation of charge carriers in P 3 HT, resulting in large SPV of - 54. 9 mV.

The most common lanthanide ions used in photon upconversion are the pairs erbium-ytterbium (Er3+,Yb3+) or thulium-ytterbium (Tm3+, Yb3+). In such combinations ytterbium ions are added as antennas, to absorb light at around 980 nm and {{transfer it to}} the <b>upconverter</b> ion.

30|$|<b>Upconverters</b> usually combine {{an active}} ion, {{of which the}} energy level scheme is {{employed}} for absorption, and a host material, in which the active ion is embedded. The most efficient upconversion has been reported for the lanthanide ion couples (Yb, Er) and (Yb, Tm) [27]. The first demonstration of such an upconversion layer was reported by Gibart et al. [28] who used a GaAs cell {{on top of a}} vitroceramic containing Yb 3 + and Er 3 +: it showed 2.5 % efficiency under very high excitation densities.|$|R
30|$|Finally, {{sensitized}} triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) using highly photostable metal-organic chromophores {{in conjunction}} with energetically appropriate aromatic hydrocarbons {{has been shown to}} be another alternative upconversion system [43, 44]. This mechanism was shown to take place under ambient laboratory conditions, i.e., low-light-intensity conditions, clearly of importance for outdoor operation of solar cells. These chromophores (porphyrins in this case) can be easily incorporated in a solid polymer such that the materials can be treated as thin-film materials [45]. A problem with TTA <b>upconverters</b> is the spectral range. No efficient upconversion of NIR radiation at wavelengths beyond 800 nm has been reported which limits the use to wide-bandgap solar cells [37, 46].|$|R

5000|$|A thermal {{upconversion}} mechanism {{has also}} been proposed. This mechanism {{is based on the}} absorption of photons with low energies in the <b>upconverter,</b> which heats up and re-emits photons with higher energies. To make this process possible, the density of optical states of the <b>upconverter</b> has to be carefully engineered to provide frequency- and angularly-selective emission characteristics. For example, a planar thermal upconverting platform can have a front surface that absorbs low-energy photons incident within a narrow angular range, and a back surface that efficiently emits only high-energy photons. These surface properties can be realized through designs of photonic crystal, and theories and experiments have been demonstrated on thermophotovoltaics and radiation cooling. [...] Under best criterion, energy conversion efficiency from solar radiation to electricity by introducing up-converter can go up to 73% using AM1.5D spectrum and 76% considering sun as a black body source at 6000K for a single junction cell.|$|E

Noise is reduced with loss image-enhanced mixers coupled to an IF FET amplifier, resulting ultimately in 6 - 7 dB noise levels compared to 19 dB gain.

50|$|These {{transmissions}} {{cannot be}} received by ordinary radios because of their low frequency.

50|$|Thermal {{upconversion}} {{is based}} on the absorption of photons with low energies in the <b>upconverter,</b> which heats up and re-emits photons with higher energies. The upconversion efficiency can be improved by controlling the optical density of states of the absorber and also by tuning the angularly-selective emission characteristics. For example, a planar thermal upconverting platform can have a front surface that absorbs low-energy photons incident within a narrow angular range, and a back surface that efficiently emits only high-energy photons. A hybrid thermophotovoltaic platform exploiting thermal upconversion was theoretically predicted to demonstrate maximum conversion efficiency of 73% under illumination by non-concentrated sunlight. A detailed analysis of non-ideal hybrid platforms that allows for up to 15% of absorption/re-emission losses yielded limiting efficiency value of 45% for Si PV cells.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development and}} characterization of photon <b>upconverters</b> fabricated with ionic liquids (ILs), which are novel fluids that are recently drawing attention due to their unique properties, such as negligible vapor pressures and high thermal stabilities. The <b>upconverters</b> {{in this study are}} based on triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) between excited polycyclic aromatic molecules, and TTA requires a fluidic media to allow for the molecules to collide with each other for energy transfer. This process, TTA-based photon upconversion (TTA-UC), was therefore mainly accomplished with organic solvents previously. It is found that the molecules used for TTA-UC, which are non-polar or weakly polar, are stably solvated in a certain class of ILs. The mechanism of the observed solvation is proposed and discussed. The upconversion quantum yields (UC-QYs) measured by continuous wave (CW) light excitation reach as high as 10 % with moderate excitation intensity (~ 6 W/cm 2), which is considerably higher than those in previous TTA-UC studies performed with organic solvents (up to ~ 4 % with CW light excitations). It is found that the value of UC-QY starts to saturate as the excitation power increases for all the cases, even within the moderate CW excitation power range in this study. An analytical model that describes the UC-QY vs. excitation power relationship is derived and compared with the experimental results. The agreement between them suggests that the donor-acceptor energy transfer in this system is highly efficient. Based on these experimental and analytical findings, it is found that efficient energy transfer between the molecules is possible in ILs and therefore ILs are not actually viscous media for the purpose of TTA-UC.
