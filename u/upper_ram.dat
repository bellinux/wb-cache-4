50|$|A {{steam hammer}} may {{have one or}} two {{supporting}} frames. The single frame design lets the operator move around the dies more easily, while the double frame can support a more powerful hammer. The frame(s) and the anvil block are mounted on wooden beams that protect the concrete foundations by absorbing the shock.Deep foundations are needed, but a large steam drop hammer will still shake the building that holds it. This may be solved with a counterblow steam hammer, in which two converging rams drive the top and bottom dies together. The <b>upper</b> <b>ram</b> is driven down and the lower ram is pulled or driven up. These hammers produce a large impact and can make large forgings.They can be installed with smaller foundations than anvil hammers of similar force.Counterblow hammers are not often used in the United States, but are common in Europe.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{coiled tubing}} or wireline, where the wire or tubing {{is always the}} same {{diameter}} allowing for a single unmoving primary barrier (stuffing box or stripper), snubbing uses a pipe, which will have an enlarged collar at the connection between the joints. Therefore, the pressure control system must be able to accommodate this variable diameter. The stripping rams accomplish this. The first stage of lowering a collar through the stripping system is to close the lower rams so as to seal off the mechanism above from wellbore pressure. The space between the rams can then be bled off allowing the <b>upper</b> <b>rams</b> to be opened. The collar can then pass through the opened <b>upper</b> <b>rams.</b> Once the collar is in between the <b>rams,</b> the <b>upper</b> <b>rams</b> are closed and pressure is equalised either side of the lower rams. The lower rams are then safely opened and the collar is lowered through the rams.|$|R
