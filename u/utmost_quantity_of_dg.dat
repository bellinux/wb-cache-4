Nutrient intake across treatments was kept constant through sub-satiation feeding. After 50 days, the percent weight gain of prawns fed the TAG diet (94 ± 6 %) was markedly higher than those fed the FFA diet (84 ± 7 %) and significantly higher (P < 0. 05) than those fed the ME (73 ± 7 %) or EE (54 ± 5 %) diets. Poor growth of prawns fed the EE and ME diets was attributed to the inability of prawns to either digest and/or metabolise the ethyl and methyl esters effectively. The apparent digestibility of neutral lipid in the EE diet was significantly lower (90. 9 ± 0. 9 %) than in the other diets (96. 5 ± 0. 9 %: TAG, 98. 1 ± 0. 6 %: FFA, 96. 1 ± 0. 9 %: ME). The digestive gland (<b>DG)</b> <b>of</b> prawns fed the TAG diet had the greatest amount <b>of</b> total lipid. <b>DG</b> lipids <b>of</b> prawns fed the TAG and FFA diets contained similar proportions of neutral and polar lipids (≃ 55 % neutral, 45 % polar), whereas with the EE diet, neutral lipids dominated (70 %) and with the ME diet there was {{a higher proportion of}} polar lipid (68 %). <b>DG</b> neutral lipids <b>of</b> both the TAG and FFA-fed prawns had high proportions of triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols with small <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> both cholesterol and free fatty acids.

40|$|In recent years, {{there have}} been {{substantial}} interests in the joint production of ethanol and distillers grains (E 2 ̆ 6 DG) from corn. At the same time, {{there have been}} corresponding increases {{in the production of}} animal feed based on distillers grains (DG). Under such circumstances, ethanol and DG are produced by an E 2 ̆ 6 DG producer, and DG serves as input to feed production by a feed producer. The objective {{of this paper is to}} study the strategies of both producers in different models in order to maximize their own profit with more ethanol produced by consuming more DG in the feed market. First, we investigate the economic relationships such as pricing between the E 2 ̆ 6 DG producer and the DG-based feed (feed) producer under Stackelberg competition as well as under coordination when both producers have their own linear production costs, respectively. (1) Specifically, for competition, we construct a Stackelberg model with an E 2 ̆ 6 DG producer as the leader and a feed producer as the follower, and examine the consequences in terms of profits, prices, and production and purchase quantities. As the DG fraction increases, the E 2 ̆ 6 DG producer loses or gains more profit than the feed producer under different conditions. Under specific condition, as the DG fraction increases, both producers have higher profit with the higher <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>DG</b> as well as ethanol so as to help the increasing ethanol market. (2) For coordination, we consider a centrally coordinated model where producers are viewed as one group. Compared with the Stackelberg model, the centrally coordinated model has higher total profit to be shared by both producers as they are optimizing the total profit as a single company with more DG as well as ethanol produced. Second, this paper extends Stackelberg model with a quadratic unit joint production cost for the E 2 ̆ 6 DG producer. For this model, we investigate the economic relationships such as pricing, profit for both producers and compared with the euqilibrium solution in the Stackelberg model with a linear joint production cost for the E 2 ̆ 6 DG producer...|$|R

Detailed investigation reveals that the solvation free energy of nonequilibrium only contains the interaction energy between the field due to the solute charge in vacuum, and the dielectric polarization at the nonequilibrium state. The solvent reorganization energies of forward and backward electron transfer reactions have been redefined because the derivations lead to a remarkable feature that these quantities are direction-dependent, unlike the theoretical models developed before.
