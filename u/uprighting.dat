40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that, after bed rest, maximal oxygen consumption (VO₂max) decreases more <b>upright</b> than supine, because of adequate cardiovascular response supine, but not <b>upright.</b> On 9 subjects, we determined VO₂max and maximal cardiac output (Q) <b>upright</b> and supine, {{before and after}} (reambulation day <b>upright,</b> the following day supine) 35 -day bed rest, by classical steady state protocol. Oxygen consumption, heart rate (f(H)) and stroke volume (Q(st)) were measured by a metabolic cart, electrocardiography and Modelflow from pulse pressure profiles, respectively. We computed Q as f(H) times Q(st), and systemic oxygen flow (QaO₂) as Q. times arterial oxygen concentration, obtained after haemoglobin and arterial oxygen saturation measurements. Before bed rest, all parameters at maximal exercise were similar <b>upright</b> and supine. After bed rest, VO₂max was lower (p< 0. 05) than before, both <b>upright</b> (- 38. 6 %) and supine (- 17. 0 %), being 30. 8 % higher supine than <b>upright.</b> Maximal Q(st) decreased <b>upright</b> (- 44. 3 %), but not supine (+ 3. 7 %), being 98. 9 % higher supine than <b>upright.</b> Maximal Q decreased <b>upright</b> (- 45. 1 %), but not supine (+ 9. 0 %), being higher supine than <b>upright</b> (+ 98. 4 %). Maximal QaO₂ decreased <b>upright</b> (- 37. 8 %), but not supine (+ 14. 8 %), being higher (+ 74. 8 %) <b>upright</b> than supine. After bed rest, the cardiovascular response (i) did not affect VO₂max supine, (ii) partially explained the VO₂max decrease <b>upright,</b> and (iii) caused the VO₂max differences between postures.

Later, Cartman admits to Kyle that he is fat, but instead of taking measures to lose weight, he acquires a scooter of his own, infuriating Kyle. Eventually, Cartman shamelessly takes advantage of his new handicapped status as he and other scooter users file multiple lawsuits against businesses to force them to make their restrooms scooter-accessible.

40|$|<b>Upright</b> {{flanking}} faces have stronger {{detrimental effects}} on the recognition of <b>upright</b> target face, than inverted flanking faces. One possible explanation for this “flanker- inversion effect” was that the more holistically processed <b>upright</b> flanking faces allowed for more erroneous feature integration. Alternatively, crowding was known to be stronger when target and flankers were more similar. Here we investigate flanker-inversion effect on crowding in Chinese character identification. Five normally-sighted young adults participated. Targets of size 1. 2 ° were presented at 5 ° in the lower visual field. Four flankers with center-to-center distance of 1. 8 ° were presented in the crowded condition. Three types of flankers were used, <b>upright</b> or inverted Chinese and <b>upright</b> Korean characters. The identification contrast thresholds were estimated by QUEST and crowding strength was measured through threshold elevation (TE). Crowding on <b>upright</b> Chinese target was significantly stronger with inverted Chinese flankers (TE = 1. 59 ± 0. 32) than with <b>upright</b> Chinese flankers (TE = 1. 47 ± 0. 29). No inversion effect was observed for inverted Chinese target. Korean flankers produced similar crowding as <b>upright</b> Chinese flankers. Our results go against the similarity rule that predicts <b>upright</b> Chinese flankers would produce stronger crowding for <b>upright</b> Chinese target. Holistic processing preferred for inverted Chinese characters may account for the findings...|$|R
