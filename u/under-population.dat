Alternatively, the natives of the mainland are invited to be part of these Utopian colonies, but if they dislike them and no longer wish to stay they may return. In the case of <b>under-population</b> the colonists are re-called.|$|E
30|$|Unlike Mexico, Turkey did not {{experience}} emigration as a challenge that aggravates <b>under-population.</b> Although the new republic was founded {{after a series of}} wars which lasted more than one decade and indeed led to severe <b>under-population,</b> demographic policies were focused on immigrants from former territories of the Ottoman Empire until population recovery in the 1940 s. Meanwhile, freedom of travel was also legally restricted until 1961, and {{there was no need for}} additional measures in the absence of easily reachable attractive destinations among bordering or nearby countries. Thus, Turkey’s history of emigration starts directly with intergovernmental agreements with Germany (Abadan-Unat, 2011).|$|E
40|$|Tradable {{permits are}} now widely {{used to control}} pollution. We {{investigate}} the implications of setting up such a system in another area - population control -, either domestically or at the global level. We first generalize the framework with both tradable procreation allowances and tradable procreation exemptions, in order to tackle both over- and <b>under-population</b> problems. The implications of procreation rights for income inequality and education are contrasted. We decompose the scheme’s impact on redistribution into three effects, one of them, the tradability effect, entails the following : with procreation exemptions or expensive enough procreation allowances redistribute resources to the rich. As far as human capital is concerned, natalist policy worsens the average education level of the next generation, while population control enhances it. If procreation rights are granted to countries in proportion to exissting fertility levels (grandfathering) instead of being allocated equally, population control can be made even more redistributive. Our exploratory analysis suggests that procreation entitlements offer a promising tool to control population without necessarily leading to problematic distributive impact, especially at the global level.

40|$|If {{migration}} between {{communities is}} costless, and if policy mak-ers in each community anticipate the migration response to policy changes, then {{the interests of}} the two communities are perfectly aligned. Decentralization is efficient. This incentive equivalence is well–known. However, the first–order approach used in virtually all the literature may obscure the fact that no convexity assumptions need be made about technology or tastes. This fact underscores the relevance of in-centive equivalence, even when there are scale economies in the public sector. Here, the consequences of positive migration costs for this incentive equivalence are considered. In contrast with much of the literature, migration costs are assumed the same for everyone. This formulation differs from the more common “attachment to home ” as-sumption of heterogeneous migration costs. Conditional on the direc-tion of migration, interests of different communities are still perfectly aligned. But natives of different communities may prefer different directions of migration, weakening incentive equivalence if local pol-icy makers have the power to induce large changes in migration flows. However, incentive equivalence fails only if economies of scale in popu-lation are important, so that communities may be “under–populated”. ∗Many thanks to Jay Wilson, who presented the paper at the conference at Queen’s in honour of Robin Boadway, May 14, 2009, for very useful comments and suggestions.

40|$|While world {{population}} {{has continued to}} increase, fertility has been falling. Projec-tions out to the year 2050 currently assume that fertility will continue to decline to, or below, replacement. 1) Past projections have been very wrong. Estimates of population growth have alternated between being far too low and far too high. 2) Similarly, public anguish has alternated between extreme fears of over- and <b>under-population,</b> neither supported by eventualities. 3) We {{do not understand the}} causes of the current fertility decline and so have little reason to project its continuation. 4) Many of the Asian countries, which are exemplars of the current decline, are exceptional because of coercion and/or vast infusions of Western capital. 5) The population decline may as readily plateau at 3 children as at 2 children. With an unknowable future, an emphasis on future population is misplaced. Concerns should be for the present. Poor families and a stressed environment are struggling with current population levels right now. Complacency about the future is unjusti-fied by the facts and may derail efforts to ensure the continuation of the fertility decline. KEY WORDS: population projections; fertility; Asian economic miracle; coercion; environ-ment. The paper by John Bermingham provides part of a much needed cor-rective to the way the population problem is presented to the public. The problem that Bermingham points to is that, since growth rates are changing, mostly decreasing, the simple calculation of a doubling time from a single current growth rate is wrong. He is completely correct on that point. Ber-mingham properly argues that, since population growth is no longer expo...|$|E
40|$|Non-local {{thermodynamic}} equilibrium (NLTE) effects in diagnostically important solar Fe I lines are important {{due to the}} strong sensitivity of Fe I to ionizing UV radiation, which {{may lead to a}} considerable <b>under-population</b> of the Fe I levels in the solar atmosphere and, therefore, to a sizeable weakening of Fe I lines. Such NLTE effects may be intensified or weakened by horizontal radiative transfer (RT) in a three-dimensionally (3 -D) structured atmosphere. We analyze the influence of horizontal RT on commonly used Fe I lines in a snapshot of a 3 -D radiation magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of a plage region. NLTE- and horizontal RT effects occur with considerable strength (up to 50 % in line depth or equivalent width) in the analyzed snapshot. As they may have either sign and both signs occur with approximately the same frequency and strength, the net effects are small when considering spatially averaged quantities. The situation in the plage atmosphere turns out to be rather complex. Horizontal transfer leads to line-weakening relative to 1 -D NLTE transfer near the boundaries of kG magnetic elements. Around the centers of these elements, however, we find an often significant line-strengthening. This behavior is in contrast to that expected from previous 3 -D RT computations in idealized flux-tube models, which display only a line weakening. The origin of this unexpected behavior {{lies in the fact that}} magnetic elements are surrounded by dense and relatively cool down-flowing gas, which forms the walls of the magnetic elements. The continuum in these dense walls is often formed in colder gas than in the central part of the magnetic elements. Consequently, the central parts of the magnetic element experience a sub-average UV-irradiation leading to the observed 3 -D NLTE line strengthening.
