500|$|The entire {{company of}} musicians {{traveled}} {{together in one}} bus, although the buses used for the tour were wholly inadequate, breaking down and being replaced with astounding frequency. [...] Griggs estimates that five separate buses {{were used in the}} first 11 days of the tour -- [...] "reconditioned school buses, not good enough for school kids." [...] The artists themselves were responsible for loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>equipment</b> at each stop, as no road crew assisted them. Adding to the disarray, the buses were not equipped for the weather which consisted of waist-deep snow in several areas and varying temperatures from the 20s to as low as -36°F. [...] One bus had a heating system that broke down shortly after the tour began, in Appleton, Wisconsin. [...] Later, Richardson and Valens began experiencing flu-like symptoms and drummer Bunch was hospitalized for severely frostbitten feet, after the tour bus simply broke {{down in the middle of}} the highway in subzero temperatures near Ironwood, Michigan. The musicians replaced that bus with another school bus and kept traveling. After Bunch was hospitalized, Carlo Mastrangelo of The Belmonts took over the drumming duties. When Dion and The Belmonts were performing, the drum seat was taken by either Valens or Holly. As Holly's group had been the backing band for all of the acts, Holly, Valens, and DiMucci took turns playing drums for each other at the performances in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and Clear Lake, Iowa.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the morning}} of 26 August, 553rd and 204th Fd Companies {{completed}} [...] the rear trestle and approach to the bridge, but when {{attempts were made to}} bring in the rafts to form the first bridge, they were raked by fire in mid-stream and about two-thirds of the crews became casualties. By mid-day half the rafts were in position, but casualties were so heavy that the CRE of 43rd Division, Lt-Col Tom Evill, temporarily withdrew his men. In the afternoon the enemy fire slackened, and the Class 9 bridge (named 'David') was complete by 17.20. Light traffic began to flow, but with little hope of the Bailey bridge ('Goliath') being ready quickly, the Corps Chief Engineer, Brig B.C. Davey, ordered a Bailey pontoon raft to be built as a ferry. With all of the available bridging engineers fully employed, Davey set 207th Fd Park Co to start <b>unloading</b> <b>equipment</b> and reconnoitring approaches while specialist sappers were called up from the rear. The first vehicle rafted across was an RE bulldozer to prepare a ramp; however, it became bogged down and a new ramp had to be built. By 06.00 on 27 August the first tanks were being ferried across to drive off German counter-attacks.|$|E

25|$|From 15 to 25 August, Talladega {{participated in}} Operation Starlight, landing marines 10 {{miles south of}} Chu Lai. On 12 September, she joined Task Group 76.3 which, in mid-September and early October, {{conducted}} the first two raids by a Navy-Marine Corps team in the Vietnam War. On 11 October, the ship returned to Subic Bay and disembarked the marines and then proceeded to Okinawa to <b>unload</b> <b>equipment.</b> After calls at Yokosuka and Pearl Harbor, the transport arrived at Long Beach on 17 November 1965.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} day, {{the transport}} {{moved to the}} Yonabaru anchorage and began <b>unloading</b> <b>equipment</b> for the Seabee unit that had begun to establish camps on the beach. Air alerts continued almost ceaselessly, day or night, but unloading operations proceeded regardless.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{problem of}} the Whaleback design was its hatches. The edges of the hatch {{openings}} and their covers would get bent, destroying the watertight seal.

50|$|Landing Ship, Tank (Hospital) (LSTH) was {{designed}} {{to act as a}} hospital ship, but because they retained armament were not officially designated as such. The Tank Landing Ship (LST) was a vessel designed to beach itself and <b>unload</b> <b>equipment,</b> vehicles, tanks, and troops onto an enemy beach. The general idea of an LSTH would be to bring troops to shore, but the convenience of a ship beached ashore proved to be an inviting harbor for the sick and injured, who could simply walk aboard.|$|R
5000|$|The ship {{underwent}} repairs {{soon after}} she arrived while concurrently loading equipment of the 109th Fleet Hospital unit {{and of the}} 544th Construction Battalion (CB or [...] "Seabees") for transport to the Philippines. She departed Brisbane on 4 February, proceeded via Manus and Hollandia, and joined a convoy off the Dutch New Guinea coast. The Allied ships arrived at Guiuan Roadstead off Samar on 27 February. Part of the Seabee unit soon went ashore to begin building the hospital, while the remainder stayed on board to <b>unload</b> <b>equipment</b> and stores. Eventually, as more Seabees could be accommodated ashore, the job of unloading passed on to Venus’ crew. Despite the lack of barges and experienced stevedores, Venus succeeded in <b>unloading</b> all <b>equipment</b> and supplies earmarked for the hospital unit before she joined a southbound convoy on 8 April, got underway for the Admiralties, and arrived at Manus one week later.|$|R
5000|$|While {{there was}} some help from John D. Rockefeller when he was {{expanding}} his control in the steel industry, the design failed primarily due to problems with the hatches. At first the hatches were [...] "flush-mounted", and when closed looked almost like part of the hull. The hatch covers and {{the edges of the}} hatch openings, however, tended to warp or get bent in use, destroying the watertight seal. Later vessels had hatch coamings. While this was an improvement, it was not enough {{to make up for the}} relatively small size of the hatches: because the sides of the boats curved in, the hatches were not as wide as on traditional vessels. The <b>unloading</b> <b>equipment</b> was restricted in its movement, and there were often collisions between the <b>unloading</b> <b>equipment</b> and the hatch edges; slow loading and unloading increases costs.|$|E
50|$|Seminole {{returned}} to Leyte on 7 October. She remained in Philippine waters, loading cargo at various points, until 18 October {{when she stood}} out of San Fernando Harbor, Luzon, for Korea. After <b>unloading</b> <b>equipment</b> and 84 officers and men of the U.S. 6th Infantry Division at Jinsen, Seminole again {{set out for the}} Philippines, anchoring in Guiuan Harbor, Samar, on 5 November.|$|E
50|$|La Rochelle {{possesses}} a commercial deep water harbour, named La Pallice. The large submarine pens built during World War II still stand there, {{although they are}} not in use. La Pallice is equipped with oil <b>unloading</b> <b>equipment,</b> and mainly handles tropical wood. It is also the location of the fishing fleet, which was moved from the old harbour in the centre of the city during the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|Three Airfield Construction Squadron RAAF {{landed at}} Mindoro on 15 December 1994. The Australians were {{in control of}} {{building}} airfields. While unloading the LSTs (Landing Ships, Tank), Japanese aircraft were attacking the area. Australians labored under the hot sun to <b>unload</b> <b>equipment</b> and supplies. Air raids occurred at half-hourly intermissions. American anti-aircraft gunners maintained a barrage of attacks but a kamikaze nearly hit an LST which Australian airmen were unloading supplies. Leading Aircraftman William Barham, 17 years old, {{was killed by a}} shrapnel. At night, the Australians at Mindoro Island already unloaded all of their equipment and gear and had moved inland to the first airfield that was to be built.|$|R

50|$|Biddle {{remained}} on station serving as either SAR picket or PIRAZ ship until early in August. She visited Hong Kong from 12 to 15 August {{and was in}} Subic Bay from the 17-20 August. The guided-missile frigate returned to duty on the northern SAR station on 22 August. Thereafter, she again alternated between SAR and PIRAZ assignments until mid-September. Long Beach relieved her {{for the last time}} on 17 September, and Biddle <b>unloaded</b> <b>equipment</b> at Subic Bay between 20 and 24 September. On the 24 September, she began the long voyage back to Norfolk. Following stops at Guam, Pearl Harbor, and San Diego, she transited the Panama Canal on 22 October and arrived back at Norfolk on 26 October to close out the year in port.|$|R

She joined the vast armada of transports 27 January 1945 en route to Eniwetok and after a stopover at that island base arrived Iwo Jima 19 February. There Hocking debarked her troops and <b>unloaded</b> <b>equipment</b> in the early waves of the assault. She then anchored offshore, received casualties, and departed 27 February for Saipan, where she arrived 2 March.|$|R
