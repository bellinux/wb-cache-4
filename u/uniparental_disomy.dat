They include paternally expressed genes (PEGs) such as DLK 1 and RTL 1, and maternally expressed genes (MEGs) such as GTL 2 (alias, MEG 3), RTL 1 as (RTL 1 antisense), and MEG 8. Consistent with this, paternal and maternal <b>uniparental</b> <b>disomies</b> for chromosome 14 (upd(14) pat and upd(14) mat) cause distinct phenotypes. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the underlying factors {{for the development of}} upd(14) pat and upd(14) mat phenotypes.

2500|$|A single-gene {{disorder}} {{is the result}} of a single mutated gene. Over 4000 human diseases are caused by single-gene defects. Single-gene disorders can be passed on to subsequent generations in several ways. Genomic imprinting and <b>uniparental</b> <b>disomy,</b> however, may affect inheritance patterns. The divisions between recessive and dominant types are not [...] "hard and fast", although the divisions between autosomal and X-linked types are (since the latter types are distinguished purely based on the chromosomal location of the gene). For example, achondroplasia is typically considered a dominant disorder, but children with two genes for achondroplasia have a severe skeletal disorder of which achondroplasics could be viewed as carriers. Sickle-cell anemia is also considered a recessive condition, but heterozygous carriers have increased resistance to malaria in early childhood, which could be described as a related dominant condition.

For example, either isodisomy or heterodisomy can disrupt parent-specific genomic imprinting, resulting in imprinting disorders.

The advances in molecular and clinical diagnosis of ImpDis help to circumvent these issues, and they are accompanied by an increasing understanding of the pathomechanism behind them.
