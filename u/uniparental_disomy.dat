They include paternally expressed genes (PEGs) such as DLK 1 and RTL 1, and maternally expressed genes (MEGs) such as GTL 2 (alias, MEG 3), RTL 1 as (RTL 1 antisense), and MEG 8.

In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the underlying factors {{for the development of}} upd(14) pat and upd(14) mat phenotypes.

2500|$|A single-gene {{disorder}} {{is the result}} of a single mutated gene. Over 4000 human diseases are caused by single-gene defects. Single-gene disorders can be passed on to subsequent generations in several ways. Genomic imprinting and <b>uniparental</b> <b>disomy,</b> however, may affect inheritance patterns. The divisions between recessive and dominant types are not [...] "hard and fast", although the divisions between autosomal and X-linked types are (since the latter types are distinguished purely based on the chromosomal location of the gene). For example, achondroplasia is typically considered a dominant disorder, but children with two genes for achondroplasia have a severe skeletal disorder of which achondroplasics could be viewed as carriers. Sickle-cell anemia is also considered a recessive condition, but heterozygous carriers have increased resistance to malaria in early childhood, which could be described as a related dominant condition. When a couple where one partner or both are sufferers or carriers of a {{single-gene disorder}} wish to have a child, they can do so through in vitro fertilization, which means they can then have a preimplantation genetic diagnosis to check whether the embryo has the genetic disorder.|$|E

IGF-I resistance is seen in heterozygous defects of the IGF 1 R. If besides short stature additional abnormalities are present, these should be matched with known dysmorphic syndromes.

Two of those, on chromosomes 15 q 25. 2 and Xp 22. 31, have not been described before and have a high probability of being causative of new deletion and duplication syndromes, respectively. In one patient, we found a deletion affecting only a single gene, MBD 5, which codes for the methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 5.

For example, either isodisomy or heterodisomy can disrupt parent-specific genomic imprinting, resulting in imprinting disorders.

The advances in molecular and clinical diagnosis of ImpDis help to circumvent these issues, and they are accompanied by an increasing understanding of the pathomechanism behind them.
