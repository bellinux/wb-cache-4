40|$|Significant {{bacteriuria}} {{is associated}} with dementia, incontinence of faeces and of urine in long-stay hospital patients. Bacteriuria in these patients is a fluctuating condition: it occurred in 47 % of an initially sterile control group {{during the course of}} a year. Management with <b>urinary</b> <b>antiseptics</b> and an initial course of antibiotics is more successful than antibiotics on demand. However, since the condition is so fluctuating, it is doubtful if any treatment is usually needed other than the prevention of faecal incontinence. The purpose of the present investigation was three-fold: to discover the prevalence of urinary infection in a group of long-stay geriatric patients and the clinical factors which were associated with such infection by comparing these with a group of non-infected patients; to discover whether it was possible to maintain a sterile urine in the patients who were infected, either by repeated courses of antibiotics or by prolonged treatment with <b>urinary</b> <b>antiseptics</b> (hippuric acid and/or nitrofurantoin) with or without the addition of short courses of antibiotics; and to see to what extent patients with sterile urine on first examination subsequently became infected.

40|$|Forty-two {{patients}} were followed up after 44 renal transplantations {{in an effort}} to evaluate possible benefits from the following protocol: systematic microbiologic and clinical surveillance, early and aggressive research for the cause of suspected infections, refusal to use prophylactic antibiotherapy, and selection of treatment according to the established cause of the infection. During 18, 030 days of follow-up 124 infections were recorded, of which 110 were bacterial, 11 viral and 3 protozoal. Eighty originated in the urinary tract, 17 in skin wounds and 10 in the lower respiratory tract. Septicemia occurred three times, and one death due to infection was recorded. In the treatment of bacterial infections patients received antibiotics for 2486 days. Ampicillin (given for 816 days) and "minor" drugs such as sulfonamides and <b>urinary</b> <b>antiseptics</b> (given for 1036 days) were used 74. 5 % of the time, whereas gentamicin was used only 2. 6 % of the time (64 days). Combined antibacterial therapy was needed 1. 2 % of the time (29 days). A restrictive policy regarding anti-biotherapy seems to be beneficial to renal transplant recipients...|$|E
40|$|Ascending {{urinary tract}} infections with stone {{formation}} {{have been produced}} experimentally in rats, using a modification of the method of Vermuelen & Goetz (1954 a, b). A zinc disc infected with a culture of Proteus vulgaris was inserted into the bladder by suprapubic cystotomy under ether anaesthesia. The pH of the urine rises from 6. 9 to 8 or 9 and calculi develop in the bladder {{within a few days}} of infection. The bladder and ureters become swollen, distended and inflamed, and renal abscesses develop. Death from renal failure generally occurs within 10 days of infection. Oral treatment with nitrofurantoin was commenced three days after infection and continued for one month. This arrested the initial rise in urine alkalinity and stone formation, and few, if any, macroscopic lesions were found at post-mortem examination. Of nine nitrofuran derivatives examined for activity against this infection several showed slight activity, but only one, N-(5 -Nitrofurfurylidene) -γ-butyric acid, was as active as nitrofurantoin when given at four times the dose, but it was also one-third as toxic. It is concluded that this technique is suitable for the examination of potential <b>urinary</b> <b>antiseptics...</b>|$|E

50|$|Hexamethylenetetramine {{was first}} {{introduced}} into the medical setting in 1899 as a <b>urinary</b> <b>antiseptic.</b> However, it was only used in cases of acidic urine, whereas boric acid was used to treat urinary tract infections with alkaline urine.

Therefore, its effectiveness as a drug depended greatly on the acidity of the urine rather than the amount of the drug administered. In an alkaline environment, hexamethylenetetramine was found to be almost completely inactive.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} demonstrated by Leonard (1924) and his colleagues that hexylresorcinol, when taken by mouth in therapeutic doses, is excreted by the kidneys and appears in the urine in sufficient concentration to kill bacteria in large numbers. A discussion of hexylresorcinol as a <b>urinary</b> <b>antiseptic</b> has been published elsewhere (Leonard, 1925). It has been shown by Leonard (1923) that: the administra-tion to persons taking hexylresorcinol, of sodium carbonate, robs the urine of its bactericidal power. It was shown that neither the alkalinity of the urine nor the presence of soda had any direct effect on {{the activity of the}} hexylresorcinol. It was found, however, that the administration of hexylresorcinol in therapeutic doses resulted in the secretion of urine of very low surface tension, while the administration of soda gave rise to urine of very high surface tension. It was therefore suggested that surface tension might play some r 6 le in governing the activity of hexylresorcinol in urine. Four of the chief theoretical considerations involved in this idea may be summarized briefly as follows: 1. Fluids of very low surface tension may, under some cir-cumstances, permeate or penetrate into minute crevices o...|$|R
40|$|In {{a search}} for a safe and {{effective}} ascaricide we found in 1930 that hexylresorcinol had valuable anthelmintic properties (1). Since that time we have studied several series of alkylphenols (2, 3, 4, 5, 6) in the hope of finding one which would have the advantageous properties of hexylresorcinol without as great a degree of local irritant action. In these experiments the neces-sity arose of determining the probable toxicity of these new sub-stances in man Leonard (7) has studied the toxicity of hexyl-resorcinol in laboratory animals, on himself, and on a group of laboratory volunteers where enormous amounts of this substance were taken without causing any untoward effects. We have studied the toxicity of this substance in rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, and dogs at the same time carrying out pathological studies on the tissues of animals sacrificed at different periods after administra-tion (2).

40|$|Mandelic acid is a chiral {{metabolite}} of {{the industrial}} pollutant styrene and is used in chemical skin peels, as a <b>urinary</b> <b>antiseptic</b> and {{as a component of}} other medicines. In humans, S-mandelic acid undergoes rapid chiral inversion to R-mandelic acid by an undefined pathway but it has been proposed to proceed via the acyl-CoA esters, S- and R- 2 -hydroxy- 2 -phenylacetyl-CoA, in an analogous pathway to that for Ibuprofen. This study investigates chiral inversion of mandelic acid using purified human recombinant enzymes known {{to be involved in the}} Ibuprofen chiral inversion pathway. Both S- and R- 2 -hydroxy- 2 -phenylacetyl- CoA were hydrolysed to mandelic acid by human acyl-CoA thioesterase- 1 and - 2 (ACOT 1 and ACOT 2), consistent with a possible role in the chiral inversion pathway. However, human α-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR; P 504 S) was not able to catalyse exchange of the α-proton of S- and R- 2 -hydroxy- 2 - phenylacetyl-CoA, a requirement for chiral inversion. Both S- and R- 2 -phenylpropanoyl-CoA were epimerised by AMACR, showing that it is the presence of the hydroxy group that prevents epimerisation of R- and S- 2 -hydroxy- 2 -phenylacetyl-CoAs. The results show that it is unlikely that 2 -hydroxy- 2 -phenylacetyl-CoA is an intermediate in the chiral inversion of mandelic acid, and that the chiral inversion of mandelic acid is via a different pathway to that of Ibuprofen and related drugs...|$|R
40|$|Background and {{the purpose}} of the study: Erica arborea L. (Ericaceae) has been used in Turkey folk {{medicine}} as a diuretic, <b>urinary</b> <b>antiseptic</b> and laxative. However, its other pharmacological effects have not been yet elucidated clearly. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate analgesic effects of its methanolic (MeOH) extract in mice using formalin test, as a model of tonic inflammatory pain. Methods: The MeOH extract of aerial parts and its fractions (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 % MeOH in water) were prepared by maceration and solid phase extraction method respectively. Effects of the MeOH extract (10, 20 and 30 mg/kg, i. p.) and different fractions (5 mg/kg, i. p.) were compared with analgesic effects of the morphine (10 mg/kg, i. p.) and indomethacine (5 mg/kg, i. p.) as standard analgesic drugs. Results and major conclusion: Results showed that the MeOH extract of E. arborea (10 mg/kg, i. p.) similar to the morphine (10 mg/kg, i. p.) and indomethacen (5 mg/kg, i. p.) decreased formalin-induced paw licking time,. Among the prepared-fractions of the MeOH extract, only fraction of 20 % (5 mg/kg, i. p.) caused significant decrease in paw licking behavior. Moreover, the MeOH extract (10 mg/kg, i. p.) did not produce any motor deficit effects in rotarod test.

40|$|Ammonium {{salicylate}} {{has been}} {{official in the}} United States Pharmacopoeia since the Eighth Revision (1905), but {{it has never been}} studied pharmacologically and very little information on the clinical use of the drug exists in the literature. It was first prepared by Cahours (1) in 1844. Martenson (2), in 1875, used it as a substitute for salicylic acid at the Children’s Hospital in St. Petersburg. Barclay (3) reported good results with the compound in the treatment of gouty arthritis, but claimed that the effects were not as marked as in rheumatic fever. H. C. Wood (4) advocated the use of ammonium salicylate throughout many editions of his textbook on therapeutics, claiming that it was more pleasant to take than the sodium salicylate. A recent editorial writer (5) has advised extensive clinical trial of ammo-nium salicylate in the treatment of influenza, alleging beneficial results from the use of the drug among troops in the World War. Recently, Stockman (6) mentioned the drug only to suggest a study of its action as a <b>urinary</b> <b>antiseptic.</b> On the other hand, Bastedo (7) claims that ammonium salicylate, in ordinary dosage, does not exhibit the actions of salicyl. This represents the sum total of clinical opinion of the drug, but obviously not without the usual confusion, and without tangible evidence of its merits or of possible advantages over the salicylates more commonly used. Thus far it might appear to be just another salicylate added to the therapeutic armamentarium and admitted to the pharmacopoeia without sufficient justification...|$|R
40|$|Urinary tract {{infection}}s (UTIs), {{the second}} most common type of infection in the body is one the most serious health problem affecting millions of people each year. The urinary tract infection (UTI) involves infection in the kidneys, ureters, bladder or urethra. These are the organs that urine passes through when eliminated from the body. Women are especially prone to UTIs, even though they generally have anatomically and physiologically normal urinary tract. [1] Reasons for this are not yet well understood. These infections can be very serious when they do occur in men; however, UTIs in men are not as common as in women. A urinary tract infection (UTI) also known as Fearnes syndrome is a microbial infection that affects any part of the urinary tract. Normally, urine is sterile. It is usually free of microbes but does contain fluids, salts and waste products. The main cause agent in at least 90 % of uncomplicated infections is Escherichia coli, which live in the bowel (colon) and around the anus. An infection occurs when bacteria get into the bladder or kidney and begin to grow. The infection often starts {{at the opening of the}} urethra where the urine leaves the body and moves upward into the urinary tract. Abnormalities of the urinary tract that hinder the flow of urine set the stage for an infection. Although modern antibiotics are being used in UTIs, urinary tract infections can be quickly and easily treated with a herbal treatment with no side effects. Herbs known for the management of urinary tract Infections and other urinary disorders divided in important categories: (a) <b>Urinary</b> <b>antiseptic</b> and anti-adhesion herbs like Juniperus spp., Vaccinium macrocarpon, Salvia officinalis, Punica granatum, Tribulus terrestris, Terminalia chebula, Ocimum sanctum, Cinnamomum cassia, Azadirachta indica and Ocimum sanctum,[2, 3] which are effective against major urinary tract pathogens namely E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis (d) Bladder protectives that control bladder and protect from infections comprising of Equisetum arvense, Hydrangea petiolaris and Zea mays[4] (e...|$|R
40|$|The {{strawberry}} tree (Arbutus unedo L.) is an evergreen shrub or small tree usually smaller than 5 m, {{belonging to the}} Ericaceae family, and typical of the Mediterranean basin and climate, although it can be also found in other regions such as the Near East and Transcaucasia. The fruits are spherical berries, about 1. 5 - 2 cm in diameter, dark red and tasty when fully ripen in autumn and winter. The berries can be eaten as fresh fruits, but they are usually prepared as preserves, jams, jellies, and marmalades. The name 'unedo' is explained by Pliny the Elder as being derived from unum edo "I eat one", which maybe due to the alcoholic content of overrippen fruits. In some countries the fruits are used to produce alcoholic beverages such as wines, liquors, and brandies (e. g. Portuguese medronho, and Koumaro in Greece). Strawberry tree fruits are also well-known in folk medicine as antiseptics, diuretics, and laxatives, while {{the leaves of the}} plant are used as diuretic, <b>urinary</b> <b>antiseptic,</b> antidiarrheic, astringent, depurative, and antihypertensive. The chemical composition of A. unedo fruits has been study by several authors (1 - 3), but almost any exhaustive description of the different phytochemicals have been carried out up to date. Recent studies have focused on the description of phenolic compounds, such as flavonoids, phenolic acids and anthocyanins, {{as a part of the}} antioxidant compositions of these fruits (4 - 6). However, very little attention has been paid to the carotenoid composition of these fruits, a part from the early study carried out by Schön in 1935 (7). Some of the studies analyzing the chemical and antioxidant composition of A. unedo fruits, concluded that β-carotene is the major and single carotenoid found in these fruits (2). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to carry out the isolation, identification and quantification of the carotenoid pigments responsible for the yellow-orange colour of the flesh of the {{strawberry tree}} fruits.

40|$|Nitrofurantoin, a {{commonly}} used <b>urinary</b> tract <b>antiseptic,</b> {{has been associated}} with idiosyncratic pulmonary and hepatic damage. We have used human lymphocytes in vitro to explore the biochemical basis of susceptibility to nitrofurantoin toxicity. The drug itself did not damage the cells as assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion. In the presence of a mouse hepatic microsomal drug-activating system, however, nitrofurantoin metabolites produced dose dependent toxicity to the lymphocytes. Inhibition of the enzyme epoxide hydrolase did not enhance toxicity; the metabolite thus {{does not appear to be}} a furan epoxide. Binding of reactive metabolites to cell macromolecules may lead directly to cell death, or in vivo, by acting as haptens to secondary immunologic responses. The metabolite caused a dose-dependent depletion of lymphocyte glutathione content. Cells from a patient with glutathione synthetase deficiency showed markedly enhanced nitrofurantoin toxicity. The findings suggest that glutathione plays a major role in protecting cells from nitrofurantoin-induced damage, and that studies of lymphocyte toxicity and glutathione metabolism in patients experiencing idiosyncratic reactions to nitrofurantoin may lead to elucidation of the biochemical and genetic basis of drug susceptibility...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1966 There are {{numerous}} references {{in the literature}} concerning the use of various Arctostaphylos species as medicinal plants. One of the species, A. uva-ursi, was listed in the United States official compendia from 1820 until 1946 as a <b>urinary</b> <b>antiseptic.</b> Many species indigenous to the Pacific Northwest were employed by the Indians {{for a variety of}} uses, ranging from consuming the ripe fruits as a food to utilizing the leaves in urinary tract and other infections. Early settlers in the West consequently used the plants for the same purposes. Phytochemical investigations of the genus Arctostaphylos have not been extensive although several members of the family, Ericaceae, yield compounds restricted only to the family. A thorough review of the literature revealed that there has been little phytochemical investigation of species other than Arctostaphylos uva-ursi. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to thoroughly investigate two other Arctostaphylos species, viz., A. Columbiana and A. patula, for organic components. The development of newer methods of extraction, isolation and identification, as well as, a screening of both plants for possible biological activity was also pursued. A new extraction solvent mixture was utilized in order to extract all of the components of interest in one extraction procedure. The residue from the extraction was then separated into two fractions; one containing sterol and triterpenoid compounds; and the other, phenolic components. The sterol and triterpene fraction of A. patula yielded the following isolated compounds; β-amyrin, β-sitosterol, ursolic acid, uvaol, and nonacosane. Only ursolic acid and uvaol were previously shown to exist in the genus. The identical fraction of A. columbiana was screened chromatographically for the same components and all except nonacosane were identified in this manner. Nonacosane was also isolated from A. columbiana. A separation of the components of the phenolic fraction was attempted using several standard methods. However, the method utilized for the identification of these compounds consisted of thin-layer chromatography and ultra-violet analysis. A relatively crude mixture was chromatographed along with a standard, both spots were eluted from the plate, scanned on a spectrophotometer, and co-spotted in three different solvent systems. This procedure proved the presence of the following compounds in both species; arbutin, ellagic acid, gallic acid, hydroquinone, hyperin and quercetin. The presence of o-pyrocatechuic acid, found in other members of the genus and family, could not be confirmed in these species. A screening for antibacterial and antifungal properties was conducted on crude plant extracts as well as the compounds found to be present in both plants. Some extracts of both plants demonstrated more antibacterial and antifungal activity than did any of the pure compounds. Further investigation is warranted in this area. Generally, the results obtained demonstrated the applicability of the new extraction scheme devised for the screening of hitherto uninvestigated plants. Eleven compounds were identified in both species, three of which had not been demonstrated in the genus previously. Another compound, assumed to be widespread in the family, was found to be absent in A. columbiana and A. patula...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Urinary tract {{infection}} (UTI) is a {{very common}} condition in clinical practice, affecting an estimated 50 % of all adult women during a lifetime. The most common causative agent is E. coli; UTI may also be caused by S. saprophyticus, Enterobacteria (Klebsiella sp and Serratia sp.), Enterococcus sp., and P aeruginosa. Recurrent UTIs occur at least twice per semester {{or three times a}} year. Prophylactic measures to prevent recurrent UTIs include changes in contraception methods, cranberry products, increased fluid intake, urination after intercourse, vaginal estrogen therapy for post-menopausal women, antibiotics, and <b>urinary</b> tract <b>antiseptic</b> agents. Objectives: To evaluate the use of a combination of methenamine and methyl-thioninium chloride in the prophylaxis of recurrent uncomplicated lower UTIs, with respect to: • Signs and symptoms of UTI • Etiologic agent(s) • Recurrence rates • Need for antibiotic therapy in case of recurrence • Incidence of adverse events associated with the treatment, including any reported alterations of laboratory tests Materials & methods: A descriptive, analytic, restrospective study was performed at Hospital Universitário Constantino Otaviano - UNIFESO. Medical charts from patients presenting recurrent uncomplicated lower UTI attended from 2001 -present were analyzed, including the following information: Demographic data (age, gender, weight, ethnicity, living conditions) : medical history/signs and symptoms of UTI; identification of treatment and dosing regimens; treatment duration; recurrence rates and need for antibiotic therapy in case of recurrence; other medications prescribed; and records of adverse events. Results: E. coli was identified as etiologic agent in 80 % of the patients. Following antibiotic therapy, all patients received prophylactic treatment with the combination of methenamine and methylthioninium chloride. Treatment duration ranged from three to six months. Adverse events were observed in 13 / 60 patients (21. 7 %). At the end of the respective treatment periods, a statistically significant (p< 0. 0001) number of patients showed no UTI recurrence. Conclusion: Based on the results from the collected data, we conclude that an orally administered combination of methenamine and methylthioninium chloride is safe and effective in the prophylactic treatment of recurrent uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection. © Copyright Morelra Jr. Editora...|$|R
