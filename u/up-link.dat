The turrets could be rotated about 300° {{at a rate of}} about four degrees per second and can even be fired back beyond the beam, which is sometimes called [...] "over the shoulder." [...] The guns were never fired horizontally forward (in the 1980s refit, a satellite <b>up-link</b> antenna was mounted at the bow). To distinguish between the rounds fired from different battleships the Iowa class used dye bags which allowed artillery observers to determine which rounds had been fired by which ship. Iowa, New Jersey, Missouri, and Wisconsin were assigned the colors orange, blue, red and green, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|KRON's newscasts {{during the}} 1980s {{regularly}} featured commentaries by Wayne Shannon in a segment called [...] "Just 4 You", {{many of which}} had a humorous tone. Shannon received billing in newscast introductions along with the anchors, and weather and sports presenters. Another staple of KRON-TV newscasts in the 1980s was live traffic reports and news coverage from the station's helicopter [...] "Telecopter 4". Bob McCarthy, Rita Cohen and Janice Huff were among the personalities who reported from Telecopter 4. Their traffic reports appeared regularly on Daybreak, during Today and Live at Five. Evocative of his folksy, down-to-earth style, McCarthy had a catchphrase, [...] "hunky snarky", that he often used to characterize roads on which traffic was flowing smoothly. Will Prater was the main pilot of Telecopter 4 {{in its early years}} and Lou Calderon was the main photographer. KRON also broadcast from remote locations during this era (e.g., Super Bowl venues) via a satellite uplink unit dubbed [...] "Newstar 4". These segments often began with an animation depicting a signal originating from the uplink location, bouncing off a satellite and ending at a satellite dish next to the words [...] "San Francisco." [...] KRON-TV regarded the satellite truck as a major competitive advantage over rival television stations, featuring it in a mid-1980s promotional spot which declared, [...] "We got a mobile satellite <b>up-link.</b> They don't." ...|$|E

Analog and other smart repeaters are general broadband amplifiers that boost mobile signals of all base stations without control. For example, signals are boosted from these base stations, which cause uncontrolled signal levels on the down-link and <b>up-link.</b> Phone signals on the <b>up-link</b> may be over amplified which cause high levels of Gaussian noise and/or inter-modulation which causes the base station/s capacity to severely drop or fail.|$|E

The device that unites both <b>up-link</b> and down-link paths, which are at 90° to each other, is known as an Orthogonal Mode Transducer OMT.|$|E
50|$|UMTS-TDD uses time {{division}} duplexing, allowing the <b>up-link</b> and down-link {{to share the}} same spectrum. This allows the operator to more flexibly divide the usage of available spectrum according to traffic patterns. For ordinary phone service, you would expect the <b>up-link</b> and down-link to carry approximately equal amounts of data (because every phone call needs a voice transmission in either direction), but Internet-oriented traffic is more frequently one-way. For example, when browsing a website, the user will send commands, which are short, to the server, but the server will send whole files, that are generally larger than those commands, in response.|$|E

The channel had hired a transponder on the Russian Ekran satellite, with an <b>up-link</b> from the USSR. Later, the company hired a transponder on the Rimsat satellite, and shifted the <b>up-link</b> to Subic Bay in the Philippines and then to Manila. Initially, the transmission time was only three hours per day which was gradually increased to 12 hours per day {{by the end of}} 1994 and later to round the clock broadcasting. In early 1995, the uplink was shifted to Singapore where it attained full operational status. With a change in the broadcasting policies of the Government of India, Asianet started an <b>up-link</b> from Chennai through VSNL.

50|$|The {{multiple}} access methods used in GSM with GPRS {{are based on}} frequency division duplex (FDD) and TDMA.

The packets have constant length, corresponding to a GSM time slot. The down-link uses first-come first-served packet scheduling, while the <b>up-link</b> uses a scheme very similar to reservation ALOHA (R-ALOHA).
