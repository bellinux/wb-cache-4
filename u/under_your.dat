5|$|This {{movement}} is {{prompted by the}} feeling that pervades {{the citizens of this}} State that in the present emergency the arms and munitions of war in the Arsenal should be {{under the control of the}} State authorities, in order to their security. This movement, although not authorized by me, has assumed such an aspect that it becomes my duty, as the executive of this Sate, to interpose my official authority to prevent a collision between the people of the State and the Federal troops <b>under</b> <b>your</b> command. I therefore demand in the name of the State the delivery of the possession of the Arsenal and munitions of war <b>under</b> <b>your</b> charge to the State authorities, to be held subject to the action of the convention to be held on the 4th of March next.|$|E

You can take on the affectations and the postures of other places and even learn to speak their ways. But the truth is, home is between your teeth.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Clement's visit, moreover, the Pope had empowered the Bishops of Dunkeld, Brechin and St Andrews {{to take action}} to rescue the bishopric. He told these bishops that, Since the continual care of all the churches is our daily burden, we grant to the said Church , so far as we personally can, and authorise you, if you find the situation to be as described, to assign to the said Bishop, if it can be done without scandal, a quarter of the teinds of all the parish churches of the Diocese of Dunblane, so that <b>under</b> <b>your</b> guidance and that of upright men, he may set aside a suitable portion of them for his own maintenance, and thereafter assign revenues for a dean and canons whom we wish and authorise you to institute there. Failing this, the Pope wrote, The quarter teinds of all the churches of the Diocese assigned to the Bishop, which are held by laymen, you shall transfer with the episcopal seat to the Canons Regular of St. John in the Diocese , who shall have power to elect a Bishop in any vacancy.|$|E

5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we know that you are a good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we ask that you will give us your flag to protect us. We have heard that you have taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands <b>under</b> <b>your</b> protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When we received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed <b>under</b> <b>your</b> protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent we mean is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but you did. O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is our last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you to be our parent, O Great Britain. We pray you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E

It is the preferred surgical technique for emplacing silicone-gel implants, because it better exposes the breast tissue–pectoralis muscle interface; yet, IMF implantation can produce thicker, slightly more visible surgical scars.|$|E

The President also said that he support Trump’s policy of “no-interference” on other countries affairs. He added “Today, America elected its new President. The strongest policy he has announced so far is to stop America’s efforts to meddle in global affairs. America needs to stop policing the entire world. This, without a doubt, is a very good principle”.|$|E
25|$|Polybius also blamed Demetrius' {{influence}} for Philip's tyrannical behavior. One incident involved Philip's apparent role in {{a massacre}} {{carried out by the}} people against their leaders that occurred at Messene in 215 BC. Arriving on the scene the day after the massacre and wanting to seize the acropolis, Philip asked his advisors whether the entrails of a sacrifice which had been made indicated that he should quit the citadel or hold it. Demetrius responded by saying: if you have the heart of an augur, quit it as quick as you can, but as a gallant and wise king, keep it, lest if you quit it now you may never have so good an opportunity again, for it is by thus holding the two horns that you can alone keep the ox <b>under</b> <b>your</b> control.|$|E

25|$|The first {{tapestries}} {{were brought}} by Queen Bona Sforza as her wedding dowry. Then in 1526 and 1533, Sigismund I the Old ordered 108 fabrics in Antwerp and Bruges. Most of the tapestries, however, were commissioned by king Sigismund II Augustus in Brussels in the workshops of Willem and Jan de Kempeneer, Jan van Tieghem and Nicolas Leyniers between 1550-1565. Initially, {{there were about}} 170 tapestries in the royal collection, among them 84 black-and-white tapestries with the royal crest and the letters SA, 8 tapestries which Sigismund I the Old had been received from the Emperor Maximilian I, and others, gifts from foreign delegations. The gifts include one tapestry with the Polish eagle bearing the date 1560, the royal initials and the letters CKCH (Christophorus Krupski Capitaneus Horodlo) next to the Korczak coat of arms and the inscription SCABELLVM PEDVM TVORVM (the footstool <b>under</b> <b>your</b> feet, Psalm 110, A Psalm of David), a gift from Krzysztof Krupski, starost of Horodło for Sigismund Augustus. The tapestries had been displayed publicly {{for the first time}} during the wedding of king Sigismund Augustus with Catherine of Austria. To this day, preserved about 138 of which exposed are about 30. They were matched in size to the walls and some of them reach the size of 5 × 9 m (5.47 × 9.84 yd). The tapestries were made of wool strands, silk and gold and woven on looms with a density of about 8 - 10 warp threads per centimeter.|$|E

500|$|Despite the song's {{commercial}} performance, critical {{reactions to}} the song were mixed to positive. Jon O'Brien of Allmusic, {{in a review of}} Megalomania, viewed [...] "Playmate to Jesus" [...] as one of the highlight songs of the album saying, [...] "The sweeping strings, inspired sound effects, and driving country-pop melodies of the lushly produced opener 'Playmate to Jesus', [...] shows the reunion hasn't been completely without merit." [...] Time said the song [...] "has the dubious distinction of sounding vaguely like a Lady Gaga track that didn’t pass quality control," [...] but was [...] "relatively catchy, boasting the kind of musical infectiousness that causes you to hum it <b>under</b> <b>your</b> breath on the subway." ...|$|E
500|$|In June, the ICC issued arrest {{warrants}} for Gaddafi, his son Saif al-Islam, and {{his brother-in-law}} Abdullah Senussi, {{head of state}} security, for charges concerning crimes against humanity. That month, Amnesty International published their report, finding that while Gaddafi's forces were responsible for numerous war crimes, many other allegations of mass human rights abuses lacked credible evidence and were likely fabrications by rebel forces that had been promoted by Western media. In July, over 30 governments recognized the NTC as the legitimate government of Libya; Gaddafi called on his supporters to [...] "Trample on those recognitions, trample on them <b>under</b> <b>your</b> feet...
