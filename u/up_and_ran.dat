5|$|In 1910, {{team captain}} Bob Milne left the club with a legacy {{as one of}} Linfield's best ever players. He had amassed nine Irish Cups, eight league titles, and had earned 27 {{international}} caps for Ireland during his time at the club. Another Scot, Marshall McEwan, joined Linfield in 1911 {{at the age of}} 26. He had previously played for Blackpool, Bolton Wanderers and Chelsea. McEwan is perhaps best remembered for his performance in the 1913 Irish Cup final, described by some fans as the best in years. McEwan retired in 1916, but remained in Belfast and later opened several businesses. In 1915, the Irish League was suspended as a result of World War I. In its place, a temporary unofficial league known as the Belfast & District League was set <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> for four seasons until the return of the Irish League in 1919. As this was an unofficial competition, any titles during this time are not counted as Irish League Championships. Linfield won this competition twice, in 1915–16 along with the Irish Cup, and in 1917–18.|$|E
5|$|The Browns next {{played the}} Buffalo Bisons in Buffalo, New York. Just over 30,000 people watched the game; while {{this was a}} lower total than the Browns' {{previous}} two games, it set a professional football attendance record in Buffalo. Playing in 80-degree heat, Browns quarterback Otto Graham threw two touchdowns {{in the first quarter}} to John Yonakor and Marion Motley. Cleveland scored for a third time in the first quarter when Cliff Lewis, substituting for Graham, pitched a lateral to Gaylon Smith, who ran it in for a touchdown. After neither team scored {{in the second and third}} quarters, the Browns added a fourth touchdown on Chet Adams' fumble return. Al Dekdebrun, Buffalo's second-string quarterback, fumbled at the Bisons' 34-yard line and Adams picked it <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> for a touchdown. The Bisons were held scoreless despite having more first downs than the Browns. The team played without its primary rushing threat, Steve Juzwik, who was sidelined with a pulled leg muscle.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland rebounded {{from its}} first {{loss of the}} season with a 31–28 victory over the Rockets. The game started slow; Groza's 21-yard field goal was the only score in the first quarter. The Rockets then went ahead by scoring a {{touchdown}} on a long pass from quarterback Vacanti to end Elroy Hirsch. Cleveland, however, piled on the points as Motley ran for a touchdown in the second quarter and Speedie caught a pass from Graham in the third. Jones added two touchdown runs in the fourth quarter, giving Cleveland a 31–14 lead. Chicago almost caught {{up at the end of}} the game, scoring two touchdowns, but the Browns held on to win. Cleveland's third-string players were on the field in the closing minutes when Chicago made its final push. Rockets rookie Ray Ramsey had three touchdowns in the game. Graham had 239 passing yards on 10 completions. Speedie caught half of them, gaining 166 yards. His touchdown came after he dropped to the ground to grab a 17-yard pass from Graham. He faked a backward lateral while on the ground, which drew Chicago's defense away from him, and then got <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> into the end zone.|$|E

25|$|On March 15, Herrera’s platoon was {{advancing}} along {{a wooded}} road near the French town of Mertzwiller when it ran into two German machine-gun emplace-ments.

Fearing that his comrades would be cut to pieces, Herrera stood <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> toward the closest enemy position, firing his rifle from the hip. He tossed two grenades at the machine-gun nest; the concussion knocked the Germans down. Then he was on them, and all eight soldiers threw down their weapons and surrendered to him.|$|E
25|$|On December 14, 2008, the New York Jets were {{trailing}} the Buffalo Bills 27–24 with 1:45 left. The Jets {{had struggled}} {{to stop the}} Bills running game the entire day and the Bills were currently in possession of the ball on their own 20-yard line when Bills quarterback J. P. Losman ran a play action option. Jets safety Abram Elam sacked Losman and caused a fumble, which Jets defensive end Shaun Ellis picked <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> for a touchdown to give the Jets a 31–27 victory (on the next Bills possession, Losman was picked off by cornerback Darrelle Revis). The New York Post ran an article the next day referring to the game as the Miracle at the Meadowlands sequel.|$|E

Stabler started the drive with an 11-yard completion to Biletnikoff. On the next play, he threw a pass to Cliff Branch at the Dolphins' 27-yard line. Branch made a spectacular diving catch and then got back <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> {{the rest of the}} way to the end zone for a 72-yard touchdown reception, giving the Raiders a 21–19 lead with 4:37 left in the game. With 2:08 left to play, the Dolphins took a 26–21 lead with a 68-yard, 4-play drive that ended with Benny Malone's 23-yard touchdown run, evading four tackle attempts by Raider defenders on the way to the end zone.|$|E
25|$|The Colts {{took the}} opening kickoff and stormed down the field. James gained 39 {{yards on the}} first five plays of the drive, and then Manning {{finished}} it with a 31-yard touchdown pass to Stokley. Denver responded on their ensuing drive, advancing the ball 49 yards in 12 plays and taking 8:13 off the clock. Jason Elam capped off the drive with a 49-yard field goal to cut their deficit to 7–3, {{but it was as}} close as Denver would ever get {{for the rest of the}} game. After the kickoff, Harrison caught three passes for 70 yards, including a pass in which he made a diving catch around three Denver players. All of them thought Harrison was down by contact and started to leave the field, but no one had actually touched him, and Harrison got back <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> 46 yards for a touchdown.|$|E

500|$|Adam {{has been}} {{involved}} with his brother's ex-wife, Sharon Newman (Sharon Case)a relationship which SoapNet described as [...] "dark". Adam stole Sharon's newborn baby, Faith, and gave her to Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson)whom he caused to have a miscarriage and a phantom pregnancy. Despite knowing this and seeing Sharon grieve, Adam bonded with her out of guilt; however, they fell in love and married. Muhney told SoapNet that Adam [...] "unequivocally loves her 100%", and [...] said, [...] "You can argue as much logic as you want about what Adam has done and what he is doing." [...] Sharon remained in love with Adam after his kidnapping of Faith was revealed. The soap's other characters, who viewed him as a criminal, were displeased with the romance. Case described Sharon's ability to forgive Adam as a [...] "tough pill to swallow", and also compared it to Nick's love for Phylliswho had [...] "blown people <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> people over". Jamey Giddens of Zap2it described Adam and Sharon's relationship as [...] "inappropriate" [...] yet [...] "red-hot". Several of Sharon's friends, including her ex-husband Jack, disowned her because of the relationship. After Sharon's conviction for the murder of Adam's ex-wife Skye, she escaped after being sentenced to life imprisonment. During this storyline, Case still supported the coupledubbed [...] "Shadam" [...] by viewerssaying that the pairing [...] "took us all by surprise". Case also said, [...] "That is what I was referring to with this storyline because of the pace and the vitality that [...] "Shadam" [...] has." [...] While on the run, Sharon slept with a man named Sam when Adam thought she was dead. Feeling betrayed, Adam tricked her into a jailhouse wedding where he abandoned her, leaving Sharon heartbroken and angry.|$|E
500|$|Though often {{considered}} an art film by modern audiences, Caligari was produced and marketed {{the same way}} as a normal commercial production of its time period, able to target both the elite artistic market as well as a more commercial horror genre audience. The film was marketed extensively leading up to the release, and advertisements ran even before the film was finished. Many posters and newspaper advertisements included the enigmatic phrase featured in the film, [...] "Du musst Caligari werden!", or [...] "You must become Caligari!" [...] Caligari premiered at the Marmorhaus theatre in Berlin on 26 February 1920, less than one month after it was completed. The filmmakers were so nervous about the release that Erich Pommer, {{on his way to the}} theatre, reportedly exclaimed, [...] "It will be a horrible failure for all of us!" [...] As with the making of the film, several urban legends surround the film's premiere. One, offered by writers Roger Manvell and Heinrich Fraenkel in The German Cinema, suggest the film was shelved [...] "for lack of a suitable outlet", and was only shown at Marmorhaus because another film had fallen through. Another suggested the theatre pulled the film after only two performances because audiences demanded refunds and demonstrated against it so strongly. This story was told by Pommer, who claimed the Marmorhaus picked Caligari back <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> it successfully for three months after he spent six months working on a publicity campaign for the film. David Robinson wrote that neither of these urban legends were true, and that the latter was fabricated by Pommer to increase his own reputation. On the contrary, Robinson said the premiere was highly successful, showing at the theatre for four weeks, an unusual amount for the time, and then returning two weeks later. He said it was so well received that women in the audience screamed when Cesare opened his eyes during his first scene, and fainted during the scene in which Cesare abducts Jane.|$|E
