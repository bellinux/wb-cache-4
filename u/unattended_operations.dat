50|$|Developed by Expans Systems {{to provide}} {{features}} and constructs that enable the programmer to intercept systems events and schedule responses, as implemented via their product Automan. Somewhat akin to BASIC, GAL enables systems programmers and operators to define logic {{to apply to}} systems messages as they flow through a multi-system (sysplex) environment. GAL also enables the programmer to define events {{that have occurred in}} the past, by intercepting Action Message Retention Facility (AMRF) messages. The language has built-in constructs to obtain the age of a retained message and make decisions about its fate depending on age. GAL can be used to write new systems commands, by intercepting and interpreting anything that is entered into an Operator Console. GAL uses keywords such as names of days of the week, names of month etc. to automatically schedule events in the system. Like REXX, GAL is both an interpretive language and a compiled language. GAL statements can be entered to the interpreter on the fly, or entire automation scenarios can be predefined, such as the logic to define <b>unattended</b> <b>operations</b> of a system, and can be compiled offline, using the compiler program GALCOMP.|$|E

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSN) {{are long}} running distributed systems comprised of tiny devices called nodes. Nodes {{are capable of}} sensing, computing and communicating. These networks {{have been developed for}} wide range of applications including habitat monitoring, military surveillance, object tracking, building monitoring, smart offices and homes. WSN has many limitations that need to be taken into account, such as hardware constraints, limited energy, dynamic networks and <b>unattended</b> <b>operations.</b> These constraints raise the necessity of adopting a middleware. Various middleware architectures have been proposed so far to achieve suitable abstraction from underlying hardware and networks. They focus on ease of application development and maintenance of wireless sensor networks. These middlewares provide the capability to support and coordinate concurrent applications and act as a bridge between hardware, operating system, network stacks and applications. This thesis surveys some of the models and middlewares suggested so far. It evaluates the middlewares with focus on design challenges arise due to the distributed and resource constraint nature of the wireless sensor networks. It presents the comparison among various middlewares and addresses the differences as well as commonalities to find out the strengths and shortcomings in each model. This thesis shows that each middleware addresses only a limited subset of issues and design challenges. Each middleware or a group of middlewares, targets a specific set of issues based on the middlewareâ€™s own design based on the type of programming abstraction they provide.

40|$|Abstractâ€”The {{application}} of nuclear reactors for space power and/or propulsion presents some unique challenges regarding the operations {{and control of}} the power system. Terrestrial nuclear reactors employ varying degrees of human control and decision-making for operations and benefit from periodic human interaction for maintenance. In contrast, the control system of a space nuclear power plant (SNPP) employed for deep space missions must be able to accommodate <b>unattended</b> <b>operations</b> due to communications delays and periods of planetary occlusion while adapting to evolving or degraded conditions with no opportunity for repair or refurbishment. Thus, a SNPP control system must provide for operational autonomy. To support the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO) project, Oak Ridge National Laboratory investigated the state of the technology for autonomous control to determine the experience base in the nuclear power application domain, both for space and terrestrial use. It was found that control systems with varying levels of autonomy have been employed in robotic, transportation, spacecraft, and manufacturing applications. However, autonomous control has not been implemented for an operating terrestrial nuclear power plant nor has there been any experience beyond automating simple control loops for space reactors. Current automated control technologies for nuclear power plants are reasonably mature and basic control for a SNPP is clearly feasible under optimum circumstances. However, autonomous control is primarily intended to account for the nonoptimum circumstances when degradation, failure, and other off-normal events challenge the performance of th...|$|E

The sensing electronics determine environmental conditions related to the atmosphere surrounding sensor transform them into an electric signal. Performing such a signal reveals some properties about objects located and/or events happening {{in the vicinity of}} the sensor. A large number of these not reusable sensors can be networked in many applications that require <b>unattended</b> <b>operations.</b> AÂ wireless sensor network (WSN) Â consists of spatially dispersedÂ  autonomous sensors to supervise physical or environmental circumstances to considerately pass their data through the network to a main location. Â If congestion occurs in the Wireless Network some or more important dataâ€™s may be dropped. A class of algorithms is proposed in our paper which is based on the congested areas of a network and data priority to enforce differentiated routing. Using simple forwarding rules a basic protocol, called Congestion-Aware Routing (CAR) discovers the congested zone of the network that exists between high-priority data sources and the data sink and dedicates this part of the network to forwarding mainly high-priority traffic. For establishing the high-priority routing zone the CAR requires some overhead as it is inappropriate for highly mobile data sources. We define Mac-Enhanced Congestion Aware Routing (MCAR) for forming high priority paths on the fly for each burst of data, which includes medium-access control (MAC) -layer enhancements and a protocol. </strong...|$|E
