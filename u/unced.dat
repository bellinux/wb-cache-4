2500|$|The [...] "Forest Principles" [...] {{adopted at}} The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (<b>UNCED)</b> in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 {{captured}} the general international understanding of {{sustainable forest management}} at that time. [...] A number of sets of criteria and indicators have since been developed to evaluate the achievement of SFM at the global, regional, country and management unit level. These were all attempts to codify and provide for independent assessment {{of the degree to}} which the broader objectives of sustainable forest management are being achieved in practice. In 2007, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Non-Legally Binding Instrument on All Types of Forests. [...] The instrument was the first of its kind, and reflected the strong international commitment to promote implementation of sustainable forest management through a new approach that brings all stakeholders together.|$|E
40|$|The {{amino acid}} substitutions in the mutant c-subunits of Escherichia coli F 1 F 0 -ATPase coded {{for by the}} <b>uncE</b> 429, <b>uncE</b> 408 and <b>uncE</b> 463 alleles affect the {{incorporation}} of these proteins into the cell membrane. The DNA sequence of the <b>uncE</b> 429 allele differed from normal in that a G leads to A base change occurred at nucleotide 68 of the <b>uncE</b> gene, resulting in glycine being replaced by aspartic acid at position 23 in the c-subunit. The <b>uncE</b> 408 and <b>uncE</b> 463 mutant DNA sequences were identical and differed from normal in that a C leads to T base change occurred at nucleotide 91 of the <b>uncE</b> gene, resulting in leucine being replaced by phenylalanine at position 31 in the c-subunit. An increased gene dosage of the <b>uncE</b> 408 or <b>uncE</b> 463 alleles resulted in the incorporation into the membranes of the mutant c-subunits. The results are {{discussed in terms of}} the 'Helical Hairpin Hypothesis' of Engelman & Steitz [(1981) Cell 23, 411 - 422]...|$|R
40|$|The <b>uncE</b> 410 allele {{differs from}} the normal <b>uncE</b> gene in that C leads to T base changes occur at {{nucleotides}} 190 and 191, resulting in proline at position 64 in the c-subunit of the F 1 F 0 -ATPase being replaced by leucine. Two partial-revertant strains were isolated in which alanine- 20 of the c-subunit was replaced by proline, owing to a G leads to C base change at nucleotide 58. These c-subunits, coded for by the <b>uncE</b> 501 and <b>uncE</b> 502 alleles, therefore contained two amino acid changes, namely proline- 64 leads to leucine, and alanine- 20 leads to proline. Membranes prepared from the partial-revertant strains lacked ATP-dependent atebrin-fluorescence-quenching activity but were {{able to carry out}} oxidative phosphorylation. The ATPase activity of the F 1 -ATPase was inhibited when bound to membranes from strains carrying the <b>uncE</b> 410, <b>uncE</b> 501 and <b>uncE</b> 502 alleles. It is concluded that a bend in the helix axis in one of the arms of the c-subunit hairpin structure is required for integration of the c-subunit into a functional F 1 F 0 -ATPase...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in the H+-translocating ATPase complex (F 1 F 0) of Escherichia coli {{have been}} {{described}} in which aspartyl- 61 of the omega subunit (<b>uncE</b> protein) is substituted by either glycine (<b>uncE</b> 105) or asparagine (<b>uncE</b> 107). Either substitution blocks the H+-translocation activity of the F 0 sector of the complex. Here we report {{a difference in the}} effects of the two substitutions on the coupled ATPase activity of F 1 bound to F 0. Wild-type F 1 was bound to the F 0 of either mutant with affinities comparable to wild-type. The ATPase activity of F 1 bound to <b>uncE</b> 107 F 0 was inhibited by 50 %, whereas that bound to <b>uncE</b> 105 F 0 was not inhibited. Complementation studies with a pBR 322 -derived plasmid that carried the E gene of the unc operon only indicated that a single mutation in the host strain was responsible for the respective phenotypes. In mutants complemented by the <b>uncE</b> + plasmid, restoration of wild-type biochemical properties was only partial and may be attributed to a mixing of wild-type and mutant omega subunits in a hybrid F 0 complex. The activity of membrane-bound F 1 was less inhibited in the <b>uncE</b> +/ <b>uncE</b> 107 hybrid. Paradoxically, complementation of <b>uncE</b> 105 by the <b>uncE</b> + plasmid resulted in substantial inhibition of the activity of membrane-bound F 1. The results indicate that a glycine-versus-asparagine substitution for aspartyl- 61 must lead to altered conformations of omega and that these differences in conformation are important in the coupling between the F 0 and F 1 sectors of the complex...|$|R
2500|$|As {{a result}} of {{lobbying}} by the developing country caucus (or Group of 77) in the United Nations (associated with the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (<b>UNCED)</b> in Rio de Janeiro, the non-legally binding Forest Principles were established in 1992. These linked the problem of deforestation to third world debt and inadequate technology transfer and stated that the [...] "agreed full incremental cost of achieving benefits associated with forest conservation...should be equitably shared by the international community" [...] (para1(b)). Subsequently, the Group of 77 argued in the 1995 Intergovernmental Panel on Forests (IPF) and then the 2001 Intergovernmental Forum on Forests (IFF), for affordable access to environmentally sound technologies without the stringency of intellectual property rights; while developed states there rejected demands for a forests fund. The expert group created under the United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF) reported in 2004, but in 2007 developed nations again vetoed language in {{the principles of the}} final text which might confirm their legal responsibility under international law to supply finance and environmentally sound technologies to the developing world.|$|E

40|$|Three mutant unc alleles (unc- 408, unc- 410, and unc- 429) {{affecting}} the coupling of electron transport to oxidative phosphorylation in Escherichia coli K- 12 have been characterized. Genetic complementation analyses using previously defined mutant unc alleles {{indicated that the}} new mutant unc alleles affect a previously undescribed gene designated <b>uncE.</b> The phenotype of strains carrying the <b>uncE</b> 408 or <b>uncE</b> 429 allele is similar in that Mg 2 +-adenosine triphosphatase activity is only found in the cytoplasmic fraction, and membranes do not bind the F 1 portion of adenosine triphosphatase purified from a normal strain. In contrast, adenosine triphosphatase activity is present both in the cytoplasm and on the membranes from a strain carrying the unc- 410 allele, and normal F 1 binds to F 1 -depleted membranes from this strain. The adenosine triphosphatase solubilized from membranes of a strain carrying the unc- 410 allele reconstituted ATP-dependent membrane energization in F 1 -depleted membranes from a normal strain. Genetic complementation tests using various Mu-induced unc alleles in partial diploid strains show that the <b>uncE</b> gene is in the unc operon and that the order of genes is uncB E A D C. The unc- 410 allele differs from the <b>uncE</b> 408 and <b>uncE</b> 429 alleles in that complementation tests with the Mu-induced unc alleles indicate {{that more than one}} gene is affected. It is concluded that this is due to a deletion which includes part of the <b>uncE</b> gene and another gene, or genes, between the <b>uncE</b> and uncA genes...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect on}} the {{function}} of the Escherichia coli F 1 F 0 -ATPase of the substitution of leucine- 31 by phenylalanine in the c-subunit of the enzyme was examined. The assembly of the mutant c-subunit requires an increased gene dosage [Jans, Fimmel, Langman, James, Downie, Senior, Ash, Gibson & Cox (1983) Biochem. J. 211, 717 - 726], and this was achieved by incorporation of the <b>uncE</b> 408 or <b>uncE</b> 463 alleles on to F-plasmids or multicopy plasmids. Membranes from strains carrying either the <b>uncE</b> 463 or <b>uncE</b> 408 alleles on F-plasmids or multicopy plasmids were capable of carrying out oxidative phosphorylation. In particular, membranes from strain AN 1928 (pAN 162, <b>uncE</b> 463) gave phosphorylation rates and P/O ratios equal to or greater than those obtained for the control strain AN 1460 (pAN 45, unc+). However, the mutant membranes, on removal of the F 1 -ATPase, appeared to be proton-impermeable. The ATPase activity of the mutant membranes was also resistant to the inhibitor dicyclohexylcarbodi-imide...|$|R
40|$|The eight {{subunits}} of the H+-ATPase of Escherichia coli are coded by {{the genes}} of the unc operon, which maps between bglB and asnA. A collection of unc mutations were transferred via P 1 transduction into a strain in which lambda cI 857 S 7 was inserted into bglB. The lambda phage was induced, and asnA+ transducing phage that carried unc were selected. Transducing phage carrying mutations in the uncA, B, D, E, and F genes were used for complementation analysis {{with a collection of}} unc mutants, including mutants which had been reported previously but not genetically characterized. Some mutations gave a simple complementation pattern, indicating a single defective gene, whereas other mutations gave more complex patterns. Two mutants (<b>uncE</b> 105 and <b>uncE</b> 107) altered in the proteolipid (omega) subunit of F 0 were not complemented by any of the lambda unc phage, even though both mutants had a fully functional F 1 ATPase and therefore normal A and D genes. Hence, only limited conclusions can be drawn from genetic complementation alone, since it cannot distinguish normal from abnormal genes in certain classes of unc mutants. The lambda unc phage proved to be essential in characterizing several mutants defective in F 0 -mediated H+ translocation. The unc gene products were overproduced by heat induction of the lysogenized lambda unc phage to determine whether all the F 0 subunits were in the membrane. Two mutants that gave a simple complementation pattern, indicative of one defective gene, did not assemble a three-subunit F 0. The uncB 108 mutant was shown to lack the chi subunit of F 0 but to retain psi and omega. Trace amounts of an altered omega subunit and normal amounts of chi and psi were found in the <b>uncE</b> 106 mutant. A substitution of aspartate for glycine at residue 58 of the protein was determined by DNA sequence analysis of the <b>uncE</b> gene cloned from the lambda <b>uncE</b> 106 phage DNA. One of the omega-defective, noncomplementing mutants (<b>uncE</b> 107) was shown to retain all three F 0 subunits. The <b>uncE</b> gene from this mutant was also sequenced to confirm an asparagine-for-aspartate substitution at position 61 (the dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-binding site) of the omega subunit...|$|R

40|$|Expression of {{the genes}} for the membrane-bound Fo sector of the Escherichia coli F 1 Fo proton-translocating ATPase can respond to changes in {{metabolic}} conditions, and these changes are reflected in alterations in the subunit stoichiometry of the oligomeric Fo proton channel. Transcriptional and translational lacZ fusions to the promoter and to two Fo genes show that, during growth on the nonfermentable carbon source succinate, transcription of the operon and translation of uncB, encoding the a subunit of Fo, are higher than during growth on glucose. In contrast, translation of the <b>uncE</b> gene, encoding the c subunit of Fo, is higher during growth on glucose than during growth on succinate. Translation rates of both uncB and <b>uncE</b> change as culture density increases, but transcription rates do not. Quantitation of the c stoichiometry shows that more c subunits are assembled into the F 1 Fo ATPase in cells grown on glucose than in cells grown on succinate.

Mutant strains carrying the uncF 469 or uncF 476 allele lack the 18, 000 -molecular-weight component of the F 0 sector of the adenosine triphosphatase in the cell membrane but retain the dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-binding protein (molecular weight, 8, 400). Conversely, strains carrying mutations in the <b>uncE</b> gene lack the dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-binding protein but retain the 18, 000 -molecular-weight protein in the cell membrane.
