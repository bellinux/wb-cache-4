He first participated in Billy Bragg's Tell <b>Us</b> <b>the</b> <b>Truth</b> tour with no plans to record, but later recorded a song for Songs and Artists that Inspired Fahrenheit 9/11, [...] "No One Left". In February 2007, he announced a solo album, entitled One Man Revolution, which was released in April 2007. Morello followed up his first studio album with The Fabled City which was released on September 30, 2008. During the latter days of his career as the Nightwatchman, Morello joined up with Boots Riley and formed the rap rock group Street Sweeper Social Club, which released its debut self-titled album in June 2009.|$|E
500|$|Hazlitt's {{essay on}} Hamlet was later used by David Bromwich in an {{extensive}} comparison of Coleridge's and Hazlitt's critical views in general. Although, to Bromwich, Coleridge's criticism of Hamlet contained {{a greater number}} of original ideas, including the general assessment of Prince Hamlet's character, Hazlitt's view is notable in that it does not, like Coleridge, reduce that character to a single dominating flaw, his inability to act. In one of his lectures on Shakespeare, Coleridge claimed that [...] "Shakespeare wished to impress upon <b>us</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> that action is the chief end of existence—that no faculties of intellect, however brilliant, can be considered valuable, or indeed otherwise than as misfortunes, if they withdraw us from or render us repugnant to action, and lead us to think and think of doing, until the time has elapsed when we can do anything effectually." [...] Hazlitt, on the other hand, instead of applying this moral, pointed to the necessity of each reader's identifying with Hamlet to understand him (which, he believed, occurred more readily than with any other of Shakespeare's characters) and the reader's judging of Hamlet in part {{on the basis of what}} that reader then saw in himself. This made it unlikely that Hamlet's entire character would be reduced to a single flaw that would provide the reader with a moral lesson.|$|E

He measured and weighed the earth and its water; the history of the moon; the history of the two nations, black and white, that dominate the earth. He gave the exact birth of the white race; the name of their God who made them and how; and the end of their time, the judgment, how it will begin and end. ... He taught <b>us</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> of how we were made [...] "slaves" [...] and how we are kept in slavery by the [...] "slave-masters children. He declared the doom of America, for her evils to us was past due. And that she is number one to be destroyed. Her judgment could not take place until we hear the truth. ...|$|E

60|$|In one sense, at any rate, {{it is more}} {{valuable}} to read bad literature than good literature. Good literature may tell us the mind of one man; but bad literature may tell us the mind of many men. A good novel tells <b>us</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> about its hero; but a bad novel tells <b>us</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> about its author. It does much more than that, it tells <b>us</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> about its readers; and, oddly enough, it tells us this all the more the more cynical and immoral be the motive of its manufacture. The more dishonest a book is as a book the more honest it is as a public document. A sincere novel exhibits the simplicity of one particular man; an insincere novel exhibits the simplicity of mankind. The pedantic decisions and definable readjustments of man {{may be found in}} scrolls and statute books and scriptures; but men's basic assumptions and everlasting energies {{are to be found in}} penny dreadfuls and halfpenny novelettes. Thus a man, like many men of real culture in our day, might learn from good literature nothing except the power to appreciate good literature. But from bad literature he might learn to govern empires and look over the map of mankind.|$|E
