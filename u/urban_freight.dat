40|$|Electric freight {{vehicles}} {{have the}} potential to mitigate local <b>urban</b> road <b>freight</b> transport emissions, but their numbers are still insignificant. Logistics companies often consider electric vehicles as too costly compared to vehicles powered by combustion engines. Research within the body of the current literature suggests that increasing the driven mileage can enhance the competitiveness of electric freight vehicles. In this paper we develop a numeric simulation approach to analyze the cost-optimal balance between a high utilization of medium-duty electric vehicles – which often have low operational costs – and the common requirement that their batteries will need expensive replacements. Our work relies on empirical findings of the real-world energy consumption from a large German field test with medium-duty electric vehicles. Our results suggest that increasing the range to the technical maximum by intermediate (quick) charging and multi-shift usage is not the most cost-efficient strategy in every case. A low daily mileage is more cost-efficient at high energy prices or consumptions, relative to diesel prices or consumptions, or if the battery is not safeguarded by a long warranty. In practical applications our model may help companies to choose the most suitable electric vehicle for the application purpose or the optimal trip length from a given set of options. For policymakers, our analysis provides insights on the relevant parameters that may either reduce the cost gap at lower daily mileages, or increase the utilization of medium-duty electric vehicles, in order to abate the negative impact of <b>urban</b> road <b>freight</b> transport on the environment...|$|R

In addition, many companies today use sophisticated computerized logistics systems to manage their supply chains and employ just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing and delivery to minimize inventory and expenses.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{analyzes}} the logistic cost savings {{caused by the}} implementation of Urban Consolidation Centers (UCC) in a dense area of a city. In these <b>urban</b> terminals, <b>freight</b> flows from interurban carriers are consolidated and transferred to a neutral last-mile carrier to perform final deliveries. This operation would reduce both last-mile fleet size and average distance cost. Our UCC modeling approach is focused on continuous analytic models for the general case of carriers with different market shares. Savings are highly sensitive {{to the design of}} the system: the increment of capacity in interurban vehicles and the proximity of the UCC terminal to the area in relation to current distribution centers. An exhaustive collection of possible market shares distributions are discussed. Results show that market shares distribution does not affect cost savings significantly. The analysis of the proposed model also highlights the trade-off between savings in the system and a minimum market share per company when the consolidation center is established...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we {{demonstrate}} how {{to capture the}} robustness of a transportation network {{in the case of}} degradable links represented by decreasing capacities. In particular, with the use of Bureau of Public Road user link travel cost functions, we propose two relative total cost indices to assess transportation network robustness in the case of travel behavior associated with either user-optimization or system-optimization. We derive upper bounds of the relative total cost index for transportation networks with special structure and congestion parameters under the user-optimal flow pattern. We also derive an upper bound for the relative total cost index under the system-optimal flow pattern for general transportation networks. Numerical examples are presented for illustration purposes. This research is the first to quantify transportation network robustness in the presence of degradable links and alternative travel behavior. This research has implication for trans-portation planning and management, for vulnerability analysis, as well as for security issues.

The Europabrücke – a well known Austrian steel bridge near Innsbruck, opened in 1963 - {{is one of the}} main alpine north-south routes for <b>urban</b> and <b>freight</b> traffic. A long-term preoccupation of VCE with BRIMOS (BRIdge MOnitoring System) on the Europabrücke (since 1997) and the assessed prevailing vibration intensities with regard to fatigue problems and possible damage led to the installation of a permanent measuring system in 2003. A lot of investigation has already been devoted to reach the superior goal, which is the determination of the relation between the randomly induced traffic loading (vehicles per day) and the fatigue-relevant, dynamic response of the structure, exclusively caused by freight traffic. As life-time predictions in modern standards depend on lots of assumptions, the emphasis is to replace those premises – referring to loading- by measurements. In that context the present work is focused on three levels...|$|R
