Holder is designed in 3 D CAD system Autodesk Inventor and is produced by Rapid Prototyping technology using Fused Deposition method. From existing Fused Deposition Modeling prototype of bigger visual part is made silicon mold and cast from resin. There is evaluation of both methods considering technical-economical aspects {{in the end of}} my work. Process of design and production using both methods is documented and described. My work includes history of ETA, a. s. company, characteristics of Fused Deposition Modeling method and technology of casting to silicon mold. Prototypes will be used for further development of holders for ETA´s hair dryers...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{conduct of}} {{cardiopulmonary}} bypass surgery requires {{the use of}} equipment and devices like the oxygenator. The oxygenator comes in different makes and each manufacturer customizes the carrier or ′holder′ of this device specific to their design. Aim: This paper presents an innovation designed to overcome the need to purchase a different holder for every oxygenator thereby cutting the cost. Materials and Methods: A sheet of iron measuring 1. 9 cm (width) × 0. 1 cm (thickness) was used to design the holder circular main frame. Another sheet measuring 2 cm (width) × 0. 6 cm (thickness) × 24 cm (length) was used to construct a V-shaped handle with the arms of the V attached to the main frame 7 cm apart. At the narrow base of the handle is a latch requiring two 13 -gauge screws to attach the holder to the heart-lung machine. Within the circumference of the main frame are four T-shaped side arms which grip the oxygenator; located at 2, 5, 7 and 11 O′clock positions. The stem of the T consist of a 0. 6 cm (thickness) × 13 cm (length) rod drilled through the main frame. The cross of the T consists of variable lengths of the same sheet as the mainframe attached to the stem by a screw mechanism. At the base of the T, is attached a circular handle (4 cm in diameter) made of 0. 4 cm iron rod. Result: An oxygenator holder which weighs 1. 75 kg with a total length of 54 cm (the diameter of the mainframe is 30 cm). Its advantages include (i) affordability, (ii) materials are locally accessible, (iii) versatility (iv) reproducibility. The disadvantages include, (i) it requires some time to fit, (ii) caution is required in fitting the oxygenator to avoid breakage, (iii) a spanner is required to lock the latch. Conclusion: The concept of a <b>universal</b> <b>holder</b> is pertinent, especially in resource poor environments to avoid purchasing a new holder whenever the usual oxygenator common to the centre is unavailable. This device is amenable to further modifications to meet the unforeseen challenges...|$|E

In this thesis, we develop a series of highly pervious liquid target designs with mean diffusion paths several orders of magnitude less than traditional, pool-type, liquid targets. Experiments have been performed to identify materials (substrates) capable of suspending, through wetting, very thin layers of liquid Ge. Four candidate Ge-substrate target systems have been designed, and (69) As production may be significantly increased over previous targets. The target systems designed include liquid Ge coated onto an: (1) inclined W plane, (2) a long thin Mo wire birdsnest, (3) a SiC weave, and (4) SiC coated C foam. A <b>universal</b> Ta target <b>holder</b> coupling the target to an ion source has also been designed and features a cooled re-circulating baffle for testing {{of each of the}} above target concepts. The results of long-term heating tests on the Mo wire birdsnest show its lifetime to be less than 100 hours; however, future online tests of short duration will test (69) As production for the birdsnested target. Ge did not wet the SiC weave target. The methods and design formulations developed in this thesis are applicable to a variety of RIB species produced from liquid targets. U. S. Navy (U. S.

40|$|In Gonzales v. Carhart the Supreme Court invoked post-abortion {{regret to}} justify a ban on a {{particular}} abortion procedure. The Court was proudly folk-psychological, representing its observations about women's emotional experiences as "self-evident. " That such observations could drive critical legal determinations was, apparently, even more self-evident, as it received no mention at all. Far from being sui generis, Carhart reflects a previously unidentified norm permeating constitutional jurisprudence: reliance on what this Article coins "emotional common sense. " Emotional common sense is what one unreflectively thinks she knows about the emotions. A species of common sense, it seems obvious and <b>universal</b> to its <b>holder</b> - but this appearance is misleading. This Article articulates and evaluates the Court's reliance on emotional common sense in constitutional law. It demonstrates that emotional common sense sometimes imports into law inaccurate accounts of the world. Justices of every ideological orientation invoke it {{in a manner that}} comports with their desired ends. Emotional common sense colors interpretation of evidence, manifests in selective perspective-taking, and shapes jurisprudential choices. Common-sense evaluation of the emotions also necessarily embodies underlying beliefs and values; enforcing them on others under the guise of simple truth silently forces a false consensus. Emotional common sense has a limited place in constitutional law. It may be cautiously embraced where an emotional phenomenon is relatively basic and universal. In all other cases the embrace should be withheld. Evaluating isolated instances in which the Court has looked beyond emotional common sense, the Article shows that a superior path exists...|$|R
40|$|International audienceContext The lower spinal {{vertebrae}} {{are often}} repaired through an incision {{directly over the}} spine, called the posterior lumbar approach. In spinal fusion, surgeon stabilizes the back by fusing certain vertebrae together with bone grafts or metal rods. For doing the surgery in minimally invasive approaches, different tools and system are designed to allow cannulated pedicle screws to be placed appropriately in a true percutaneous fashion. However, the rod insertion still has problems and difficulties that prevent the procedure to be in minimally invasive. Purpose The {{purpose of this paper}} is to address the difficulties of the surgical tasks for rod insertion, to review the existing system and procedures for rod insertion, and to propose a new designed system that enables surgeon to insert the rod and guide it through the pedicle screws in MIS conditions. Materials and methods With the collaboration of the Hospital of Grenoble, France, the study started and some spinal fusion operation in open and minimally invasive procedure have been observed and analysed. Based on the extracted task list, a scenario for orthopaedic traumatology was prepared. The main objective for the design was to have a <b>universal</b> recipient rod <b>holder</b> (independent to the rod type), an easy load and unload system, and simple assembly after which fit with the sterilisation procedure. A first prototype have been fabricated and tested on a phantom. With some modification the second prototype have been designed and tested by surgeons on cadaver. Results The result of both ex-vivo and cadaver tests seems promising. The rod holder submitted for patent and a series of clinically approved prototypes are fabricated to be used in operations by different surgeons and Genoble Hospital to have the enough evidences for clinical validation of the instrument...|$|R
