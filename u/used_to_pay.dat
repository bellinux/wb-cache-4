Bonds used by a government to finance major construction projects, to be paid by tax levies {{over a period of}} years, require a debt service fund to account for their repayment. The debts of permanent and proprietary funds are serviced within those funds, rather than by a separate debt service fund.|$|E

It used to be produced in the Mediterranean region where these shells are endemic. It was an expensive fabric and overfishing has much reduced populations of the pen shell.

If Fulton County does not call a referendum within ten days of the grant of authority, or if the referendum fails to pass, the Act provides authority for the City of Atlanta to call a referendum on a one percent special purpose local option sales tax increase for the City <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for water and sewer projects and associated costs. The Act also provides the authority for a consolidated government, with a freeze on property tax assessments in place, to call a referendum on a one percent special purpose local option sales tax increase that the government entity may <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for governmental operations.

5|$|After {{the repeal}} of the Stamp Act, Parliament took a {{different}} approach to raising revenue, passing the Townshend Acts in 1767 which established new duties on various goods imported into the colonies. These duties were relatively low because the British ministry wanted to establish the precedent that Parliament had the right to impose tariffs on the colonies before raising them. Revenues from these duties were to be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for governors and judges who would be independent of colonial control. To enforce compliance with the new laws, the Townshend Acts created a customs agency known as the American Board of Custom Commissioners, which was headquartered in Boston.|$|E

In 1997 {{the federal government was}} planning to cut funding for the Big Dig by $300 million per year. The state set up a trust and sold Grant Anticipation Notes (GANs) to investors. The notes were secured by promising future federal highway funds. As federal highway dollars are awarded to Massachusetts, the money is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> off the GANs.|$|E

5|$|A popular tourist destination, Ambohimanga {{received}} 97,847 {{visitors in}} 2011.

Multilingual tour guides can be hired at the site to provide detailed descriptions of its features and history. Photographs are permitted outdoors but prohibited inside the historic buildings. Tourism has been negatively affected at the site {{as a consequence of the}} 2009 Malagasy political crisis; management of the site has also been hampered by political instability and reduced revenues since 2009.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimate}} in February 2007 {{placed the}} initial construction cost of One World Trade Center at about $3 billion, or $1,150 {{per square foot}} ($12,380 per square meter). However, the tower's total estimated construction cost had risen to $3.9 billion by April 2012, making it the most expensive building {{in the world at}} the time. The tower's construction was partly funded by approximately $1billion of insurance money that Silverstein received for his losses in the September 11 attacks. The State of New York provided an additional $250million, and the Port Authority agreed to give $1billion, which would be obtained through the sale of bonds. The Port Authority raised prices for bridge and tunnel tolls to raise funds, with a 56percent toll increase scheduled between 2011 and 2015; however, the proceeds of these increases were not <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for the tower's construction.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of a report written by Newton on 21 September 1717 to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury the {{bimetallic}} relationship between gold coins and silver coins was changed by Royal proclamation on 22 December 1717, forbidding the exchange of gold guineas for more than 21 silver shillings. This inadvertently resulted in a silver shortage as silver coins were <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for imports, while exports were paid for in gold, effectively moving Britain from the silver standard to its first gold standard. It is a matter of debate as whether he intended to do this or not. It has been argued that Newton conceived of his work at the Mint as a continuation of his alchemical work.|$|E
5|$|At about 11pm, the rioters {{arrived at}} the house of the Reverend John Vachell, who, after {{threatening}} to shoot anyone who entered his house, was disarmed when threemen rushed him. He fled on foot {{with his wife and two}} daughters towards Ely. After Vachell had left, the rioters destroyed his goods and chattels and stole some of his silverware. Vachell was later to sue the Hundred of Ely for the damages under the Riot Act. He received over £708 (£), an award which was challenged in the press, as many people complained about the size of the resulting district levies <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for it. The rioters then stopped a post-chaise returning with Hugh Robert Evans senior and Henry Martin from a Turnpike Trust meeting in Downham. They robbed Evans of 14shillings (£) before allowing them both to proceed. On reaching Ely, Evans alerted the magistrates who sent a carriage for Reverend Vachell, which collected him and his family walking towards Ely.|$|E

The two remaining Boeing aircraft were re-registered with Aer Lingus on 10 June. By late August the debt in the company had been assessed to NOK30 million, making it the largest bankruptcy till then in Norwegian history. The largest creditor was Boeing, which was owed NOK7 million. The creditors and shareholders lost all of their investments in the company because the airline's limited assets were <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> outstanding wages. Tjøntveit stated on 8 September that he intended to sue Boeing for damages from the seizure of the aircraft, but by October no writ of summons had been received by the manufacturer.|$|E

5|$|Cordray has the {{distinction}} of being an undefeated five-time champion and Tournament of Champions semifinalist on Jeopardy! In 1987, he won $45,303 from the show, which he <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> law school debt, to pay taxes and to buy a used car. The total winnings came from $40,303 in prize money during his five-contest streak and $5,000 for a first round win on the Tournament of Champions. His campaign for public office in 1990 precluded him from participating in the Super Jeopardy! elimination tournament of champions. ABC, the network that carried the tournament, had a policy against political contestants appearing on the show (excluding Celebrity Jeopardy!). He did, however, compete in the Battle of the Decades tournament, appearing in the show aired February 5, 2014, but finished second to aerospace consultant Tom Nosek. Because of his duties as a federal employee, however, he turned down the $5,000 consolation money he won in the match.|$|E
5|$|During the Han Dynasty, silk became {{progressively}} more valuable {{in its own}} right, and became more than simply a material.

By the same token that one would sometimes estimate the price of products according to a certain weight of gold, {{the length of the}} silk cloth became a monetary standard in China (in addition to bronze coins). The wealth that silk brought to China stirred envy in neighboring peoples. Beginning in the 2nd century BCE, the Xiongnu regularly pillaged the provinces of the Han Chinese for around 250 years. Silk was a common offering by the emperor to these tribes in exchange for peace.|$|E

The hoards may be the remnants of hoards left in Kaleb's time (perhaps <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> soldiers), when it was under an Aksumite governor. Outside of the Horn of Africa and Arabian Peninsula, coins have been found as far as Israel, Meroe, Egypt, and India.
