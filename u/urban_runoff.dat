5|$|Chlorine is {{responsible}} for the degradation of fish and shrimp in the creek. The sources for chlorine in <b>urban</b> <b>runoff</b> include irrigation and car washing.

40|$|<b>Urban</b> {{stormwater}} <b>runoff</b> contains {{heavy metals}} including copper, lead, and zinc; organics such as pesticides, PAHs, and unidentified compounds; and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) in concentrations {{that are a}} threat to cause water quality problems in the waters receiving the runoff. In 1990 the US EPA adopted an <b>urban</b> stormwater <b>runoff</b> water quality management program that requires that municipalities control pollution of receiving waters for runoff to the maximum extent practicable using best management practices (BMPs), and, through a BMP ratcheting-down process, ultimately control violations of water quality standards in the runoff. This regulatory program has several significant problems, including the high cost (dollars/person/day) of treating <b>urban</b> stormwater <b>runoff</b> to control water quality standards violations, and the general ineffectiveness of conventional BMPs for contaminant control. Further, heavy metals and some other potential pollutants in <b>urban</b> stormwater <b>runoff</b> are largely in non-toxic, unavailable forms. There is need for <b>urban</b> stormwater <b>runoff</b> water quality managers to conduct studies to determine the constituents in stormwater runoff that cause significant pollution of the receiving waters. Those constituents that are causing significant water quality use-impairments can potentially be controlled through source control. There is also need to develop wet weather water quality standards to regulate <b>urban</b> stormwater <b>runoff</b> water quality impacts...|$|R

5|$|The Sulphur Creek {{watershed}} {{has had a}} {{long history}} of water pollution, which can be attributed to residential development. While no raw sewage flows into the creek, the creek is contaminated by large quantities of <b>urban</b> <b>runoff</b> from impervious paved surfaces that collects toxins before pouring untreated into the creek. There are over four large storm drain outlets that pour directly into Sulphur Creek. Such untreated runoff has caused E. coli and Enterovirus to increasingly harm the creek and its remaining biodiversity. Channelization is also another factor, and standing water in the Sulphur Creek Reservoir has suffered eutrophication. The primary source of bacteria contamination is the largest tributary of Sulphur Creek, now mostly underground. The channel joins the creek not too far from its mouth. It has been proved that 87 percent of the Sulphur Creek mainstem is severely degraded.|$|E
5|$|Below Prado Dam, the Santa Ana River crosses into Orange County, {{and cuts}} between the Santa Ana Mountains and Chino Hills via the narrow Santa Ana Canyon. The river roughly bisects the county as it flows {{southwest}} towards the ocean. In Anaheim, the entire {{flow of the}} river (except during wet seasons) is diverted into spreading grounds for groundwater recharge of the north Orange County aquifer, providing {{about half of the}} county's municipal water supply. Downstream of there, the river is mostly confined to a concrete channel, serving only for flood control and <b>urban</b> <b>runoff</b> drainage, and is usually dry or a small trickle. At Orange it receives Santiago Creek from the east before entering Santa Ana. After crossing under Interstate 5 it passes through the River View Golf Course, one of its few non-concreted sections within Orange County, and then becomes a concrete channel again through most of Santa Ana and Fountain Valley to a point below the 405 Freeway, where the river bed becomes natural (though the banks remain concrete). The mouth of the river is located in a small tidal lagoon between Huntington Beach and Costa Mesa, at the northern end of Santa Ana River County Beach.|$|E

40|$|The {{finding of}} {{widespread}} <b>urban</b> stormwater <b>runoff</b> aquatic life toxicity and the listing of waterbodies experiencing this toxicity as 303 (d) listed impaired waterbodies has established the total maximum daily load (TMDL) process to control this toxicity {{in several areas}} of California. Since the toxicity is typically associated with the organophosphate pesticides (OP pesticides) diazinon and chlorpyrifos, often these chemicals are targeted as the constituents that must be controlled in the TMDL process. However, considerable confusion exists today on the appropriate goal for the OP pesticide aquatic life toxicity control TMDL process. This paper reviews {{some of the issues}} that are pertinent to establishing TMDL goals for OP pesticide-caused aquatic life toxicity. A discussion is presented on some of the aspects of establishing appropriate TMDL goals that need to be considered in appropriately regulating OP pesticide-caused aquatic life toxicity in <b>urban</b> stormwater <b>runoff.</b> While the focus of this paper is <b>urban</b> stormwater <b>runoff,</b> the same issues apply to agricultural stormwater runoff where the toxicity is due to the use of OP pesticides.

5|$|With the {{increased}} flood protection {{afforded by the}} Prado Dam, major industrial development migrating south from the Los Angeles Basin, and the Southern California housing boom in the 1950s and 1960s, the Santa Ana River watershed began its third and final transition—from agricultural to urban. The population of the Santa Ana River basin increased dramatically, but brought with it the threat of greater damage from floods, somewhat compromising the protection afforded by Prado Dam. Because housing and urban areas encroached on the river's historic floodplain—an area once occupied by farms—and the river became confined to a narrow channel—a flood {{similar to the ones}} surrounding the turn of the 20th century would cause much more damage. The construction of roads and buildings also heightened the runoff that would flow into the river during rainfall, a process known as <b>urban</b> <b>runoff.</b> In fact, the river flooded again in 1969, and while much of the runoff from the Inland Empire was captured behind Prado Dam—probably saving Orange County from an even greater flood—Santiago Creek, a large tributary flowing from the Santa Ana Mountains, eroded its banks until it swept away portions of residential communities in the cities of Tustin and Orange.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{pronounced}} effects of <b>urban</b> <b>runoff</b> is on watercourses that historically contained little or no water during dry weather periods (often called ephemeral streams). When an area around such a stream is urbanized, the resultant runoff creates an unnatural year-round streamflow that hurts the vegetation, wildlife and stream bed of the waterway. Containing little or no sediment relative to the historic ratio of sediment to water, <b>urban</b> <b>runoff</b> rushes down the stream channel, ruining natural features such as meanders and sandbars, and creates severe erosion—increasing sediment loads at the mouth while severely incising the stream bed upstream. As an example, on many Southern California beaches {{at the mouth of}} a waterway, <b>urban</b> <b>runoff</b> carries trash, pollutants, excessive silt, and other wastes, and can pose moderate to severe health hazards.|$|E
40|$|Environmental flow {{assessment}} frameworks {{have begun}} to consider changes to flow regimes resulting from land-use change. <b>Urban</b> stormwater <b>runoff,</b> which degrades streams through altered volume, pattern and quality of flow, presents a problem that challenges dominant approaches to stormwater and water resource management, and to environmental flow assessment. We used evidence of ecological response to different stormwater drainage systems to develop methods for input to environmental flow assessment. We identified the nature of hydrologic change resulting from conventional <b>urban</b> stormwater <b>runoff,</b> and the mechanisms by which such hydrologic change is prevented in streams where ecological condition has been protected. We also quantified the increase in total volume resulting from <b>urban</b> stormwater <b>runoff,</b> by comparing annual streamflow volumes from undeveloped catchments with the volumes that would run off impervious surfaces under the same rainfall regimes. In catchments with as little as 5 – 10 % total imperviousness, conventional stormwater drainage, associated with poor in-stream ecological condition, reduces contributions to baseflows and increases the frequency and magnitude of storm flows, but in similarly impervious catchments in which streams retain good ecological condition, informal drainage to forested hillslopes, without a direct piped discharge to the stream, results in little such hydrologic change. In urbanized catchments, dispersed urban stormwater retention measures can potentially protect urban stream ecosystems by mimicking the hydrologic effects of informal drainage, if sufficient water is harvested and kep...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: One of the {{principal}} components of the contaminant load in <b>urban</b> stormwater <b>runoff</b> is oil and grease (O&G) pollution, resulting from vehicle emissions.

Approximately 80 to 95 % removal of all contaminants from synthetic runoff was found via sorption and filtration. Subsequently, approximately 90 % of the sorbed naphthalene, toluene, oil, and particulate-associated naphthalene was biodegraded within approximately 3, 4, 8, and 2 days after the event, respectively, based on decreases in contaminant concentrations coupled with increases of microbial populations.
