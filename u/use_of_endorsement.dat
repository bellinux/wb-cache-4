Critical loads have been developed in Europe to provide an effects-based approach to pollutant abatement including nitrogen deposition. Critical loads to protect ecosystems from eutrophication from excess nitrogen are only specified for very broad habitat types (eg "dry heaths") and as a range of values (eg between 10 and 20 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1). There may be considerable variation in vegetation communities within a broad habitat {{and there is a}} requirement (eg. from conservation agencies etc.) for more precise critical loads for more clearly specified receptors (habitats, vegetation communities). This paper demonstrates the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>Endorsement</b> Theory to rationalise incomplete, qualitative and conflicting information on abiotic parameters (eg, climate, management) that may influence the vegetation response to nitrogen deposition and hence the critical loads. The results are shown for 22 heaths described in the National Vegetation Classification, identifying whether the critical load should be nearer the upper or lower limit of the published ranges. The policy implications for critical loads exceedance for European Dry Heaths are also discussed...|$|E

To promote the products, indeed, the producer needs advertisements in order to inform, attract, and persuade the children, as the consumers, to buy the product. Since television becomes a part of children?s life, the writer chooses advertisements on television {{as the source of}} this study. This study is about the language claim on children advertisements. A claim usually shows the superiority of the product by using clever vocabulary to manipulate the consumers. Therefore, consumers should pay attention and carefully to the claim so they will not misunderstanding about the product. Moreover, the writer would like to identify the claims used on children advertisements, and also the claims that mostly used on the children advertisements. The data is analyzed employing the theories written by Schrank, (1998) which on the book titled "Exploring language". He has classified the kinds of claim into ten categories. For supporting the theory, the writer used Lutz?s theory, where he classified the words that are used for Weasel Claim. Descriptive quantitative approach is used in this study. Findings show that Weasel claim is the most frequently use claim on children advertisement because perhaps, children can understand the words such as help, can be, work, etc, easily. Furthermore, "can be" is used the most among the weasel claim. On the other hand, the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>endorsement</b> or testimonial claim and the compliment of the consumers could not be found in this study...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This {{research}} has been conducted with the aim of determining if celebrity endorsers in political party advertising {{have a significant impact on}} UK voter intentions. The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> celebrity <b>endorsements</b> is commonplace in the USA, but little is known about its effects in the UK. This research also aims to incorporate the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> celebrity <b>endorsements</b> in political party advertising with the political salience construct. Political salience represents how prominent politics and political issues are in the minds of the eligible voter. Design / methodology / approach: A 2 (endorser: celebrity; non-celebrity) x 2 (political salience: high; low) between-subjects factorial design experiment was used. The results show that celebrity endorsements do play a significant role in attitudes towards the political advert, attitudes towards the endorser and voter intention. However, this effect is significantly moderated by political salience. Findings: The results show that low political salience respondents were significantly more likely to vote for the political party when a celebrity endorser is used. However, the inverse effect is found for high political salience respondents. Practical implications: The results offer significant insights into the effect that celebrity endorsers could have in future elections and the importance that political salience plays in the effectiveness <b>of</b> celebrity <b>endorsement.</b> If political parties are to target those citizens that do not actively engage with politics then the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> celebrity <b>endorsements</b> would make a significant impact, given the results of this research. Originality / value: This research would be of particular interest to political party campaigners as well as academics studying the effects of advertising and identity salience...|$|R

40|$|Advertising and {{marketing}} managers {{spend a great}} deal of money to have celebrities endorse their product. Some view it to be an effective form of advertising as evidenced by the number of celebrityendorsed advertisements that have increased. Despite numerous amounts of research on celebrities endorsing a single product, little research has been conducted regarding the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> multiple-celebrity <b>endorsements</b> in advertising. This study is based on the research by Hsu and McDonald (2002), who documented the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> multiple-celebrity <b>endorsement</b> advertising in the milk moustache campaign in the USA. This study investigated the tendency towards correspondence inference of 200 respondents and researched their attitudes towards celebrities, the product being advertised, and the advertisement as a whole. The main findings are that there is a significant correlation between correspondence inference and attitudes towards the celebrity, but suggests that the levels of correspondence inference between the paid and unpaid situations depend on the celebrity. Implications are that marketers need to realise that correspondence inference might have an influence on peopleâ€™s attitudes towards the celebrity who endorses the product...|$|R

A critical review of extant literature revealed that celebrity endorsement makes advertisement more memorable and the company in the short-run generates high brand awareness as well as an increase in market share. There are certain risks associated with celebrity endorsement such as negative publicity, overshadowing, multiple endorsement, over-endorsement, extinction and cost implications. The study indicated that, successful celebrity endorsement is a combination of attributes such as trustworthiness, expertise, similarity, familiarity, likeability, and a match between the celebrity and the message (brand,).

Three endorsement programs were examined: those of the two major retailers in the United Kingdom, Tesco and Sainsbury's, and the "Pick the Tick" program of the National Heart Foundation of Australia. The main methodology used was protocol analysis. This involves the subject "thinking aloud" while performing a task [...] in this case, (a) shopping normally and (b) shopping "healthily" for foods on a predetermined list [...] to generate a protocol. Each subject was also interviewed to investigate reported <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>endorsements.</b> Subjects were a quota sample (N = 44) of shoppers representative of the U. K. and Australian populations. Information about the subjects, the protocols, and interview data were analyzed quantitatively; the protocols were also analyzed qualitatively. Sainsbury's and Australian shoppers never used the endorsements when shopping but Tesco shoppers did, albeit rarely. Tesco shoppers used the endorsement in complex ways and not just as a trigger to food selection. They sometimes used the endorsement to reject endorsed foods. Subjects claimed to use the endorsements even though the protocol analysis revealed no actual use. There are features <b>of</b> the Tesco <b>endorsement</b> program that make it more helpful to consumers than the other programs...|$|R

40|$|Research on {{political}} marketing in Africa {{in general and}} Ghana in particular has focused little attention on the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> celebrity political <b>endorsement</b> in election campaigns. At the same time, prior research on the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> celebrity political <b>endorsements</b> in election campaigns has predominantly focused on Western democracies {{and the application of}} marketing brand theories to the examination <b>of</b> celebrity political <b>endorsement.</b> Such research studies include very little investigation on new and emerging democracies, especially in Africa while the theories have proven inadequate to explain how the persuasive qualities of celebrities are utilized within the political field. This thesis, like Driessens (2013) is advocating that theorising celebrity as a form of capital can explain the qualities of celebrity which can be transferred across social fields including the political field. At the same time the socio-political conditions that enable celebrities to migrate from the entertainment to the political field are specific to their national and historical contexts (Ribke 2015) as presented in the Ghana context. The study therefore examines theories of celebrity capital and how this capital is utilized in the form <b>of</b> political <b>endorsements</b> in the political field of an emerging democracy like Ghana. The thesis enhances the arguments about how theories of celebrity capital can be used to explain the role <b>of</b> celebrity political <b>endorsements</b> in shaping political communication and political marketing during election campaigns while providing the socio-political conditions that shape celebrity migration into the political field in Ghana...|$|R

Â  Endorsements {{can either be}} {{in the form of}} a celebrity acting as a spokesperson for an organisation or the organisation can create a spokesperson to act as an endorser. Â  The problem that faces marketers is that little scientific proof exists if students perceive celebrity endorsements and creative spokespersons differently with regard to their expertise and trustworthiness. Â  The aim of this study was to determine the attitudes of respondents with regard to expertise, trustworthiness and attractiveness of created spokesperson and celebrity endorsements in advertisements. This knowledge will provide marketing professionals with the strategic advantage of how and when to make <b>use</b> <b>of</b> an endorser. Ohanianâ€™s (1990) measurement scale of perceived expertise, trustworthiness and attractiveness was adopted in a self-administrative questionnaire for this article. Â  Respondents (n= 185) were exposed to six visual images of endorsers namely:Â  three celebrities and three created spokespersons. Â  It was found that attractiveness should not be used as a factor when comparing created endorsers with celebrity endorsers. Â  The respondents perceived both endorsement applications as highly credible and professionals need to consider each applicationâ€™s advantages and disadvantages when deciding which application will be more effective for their advertising strategy. Â  In the long term the organisation might find it more cost effective to create its own spokesperson due to the risk of possible characteristics changes or negative associations of celebrity endorsers. Â  Revoking advertisements after celebrity endorsers have received negative publicity or changed character can lead to great financial losses. Â  Created endorsers, on the other hand, provide the organisation with greater control and the ability to change to adapt to the organisations market and advertising needs...|$|R

Using a 2 Â´ 2 between-subjects experimental design (N = 122), the level of website interactivity and the (in) congruence between the celebrity and the organization are manipulated. The results show that an incongruent celebrity endorser incites a more favorable website experience than a congruent endorser on an interactive website. This, in turn, leads to a more positive attitude and a higher donation intention for the charity. In a non-interactive context, a congruent versus incongruent endorser has no differential impact on peopleâ€™s responses...|$|R
