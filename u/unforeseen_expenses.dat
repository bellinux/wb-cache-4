5|$|More than 30,000 {{artifacts}} from Kronan have been salvaged and cataloged, ranging from bronze cannons {{of up to}} four tonnes to small eggshell fragments. There have been several discoveries of considerable importance, and some of unique historical and archaeological value. One of the first finds was a small table cabinet with nine drawers containing navigational instruments, pipe-cleaning tools, cutlery and writing utensils, which most likely belonged {{to one of the}} officers. As a flagship, Kronan carried a large amount of cash in the form of silver coins. Besides wages for the crew, a war chest was required for large, <b>unforeseen</b> <b>expenses.</b> In 1982, a collection of 255 gold coins was found, most of them ducats. The origin of the individual coins varied considerably, with locations such as Cairo, Reval (modern-day Tallinn), and Seville. Another 46 ducats were found in 2000. The coin collection is probably the largest gold treasure ever encountered on Swedish soil, though it was not enough to cover large expenses, which has led to the assumption that they were the personal property of Admiral Lorentz Creutz. In 1989, more than 900 silver coins were found in the remains of the orlop, at the time the largest silver coin collection ever discovered in Sweden. In 2005, a much larger cache of nearly 6,200 coins was uncovered and in 2006 yet another with more than 7,000 coins. The silver treasure of 2005 consisted almost entirely of 4 öre-coins minted in 1675, which represented over 1% of the entire production of 4 öre-coins of that year.|$|E

50|$|The {{company had}} a {{difficult}} time in its first year of production and initial shipments of meat from Townsville were unsuccessful. Transport from Ross River was problematic with the meat taken by rail to the Townsville wharf, then loaded aboard a lighter, and reloaded for shipping to London. It is unclear which part of the process failed, but the first shipment arrived in London in early December 1892 in a putrid state. At the same time the directors had taken out further loans because of numerous <b>unforeseen</b> <b>expenses</b> in the construction of both meatworks. The next shipment to reach England in mid-January included meat from the company's recently opened Eagle Farm meatworks, but was partially spoilt. The 1893 Brisbane floods silted up the Brisbane River inhibiting coastal shipping and halting production from both meatworks for some time. Another shipment of Townsville meat which arrived in London in May was also found to be tainted. The company overcame its early problems and appointed a new director, William Forrest in January 1893. He soon became Chairman of the Board and is credited with turning the company into a successful enterprise.|$|E

40|$|Ethiopia {{is one of}} the world’s poorest {{nations with}} a per capita income of about US$ 157. About 44 % of the {{population}} live below poverty line. Farmers often lack financial resources to make necessary investments in agriculture. The formal financial services provided by banks are less accessible to poor farmers. Although the informal moneylenders are accessible to the poor farmers, the interest rates charged are very high. As a result, providing rural financial services through microfinance institutions {{has become part of the}} poverty reduction strategies of most developing economies. This research was undertaken at Finoteselam Town, Northwestern Ethiopia. It was done with the objectives of estimating the parameters that determine credit market participation and loan repayment performance. Primary data from 200 households were collected through a questionnaire survey during the summer period in 2006. The bivariate probit and logit models were estimated using Stata software. Estimation results of the bivariate probit model indicated that variables such as higher family size, large landholding size, household’s labour endowment, participation in off farm employment activities and incurring <b>unforeseen</b> <b>expenses</b> increased the probability of households to participate in credit markets. On the other hand, variables such as village dummy and borrowing from other sources decreased the probability of households to participate in the credit scheme. Estimation results of the logit model revealed that variables such as higher family size, incurring <b>unforeseen</b> <b>expenses,</b> and taking loans for the purpose of oxen fattening decreased the probability of repayment performances. On the other hand, variables such as participation in off farm employment activities and an increase in loan term increased the probability of loan repayment performances. Microfinance institutions like ACSI should target those poor households that participate in off farm employment activities, and those with better labour endowment. They should also focus on supervision of clients so as to avoid diversion of loans to consumption ends due to <b>unforeseen</b> <b>expenses,</b> or higher dependency burden. Family planning, creating enabling conditions for insurance markets, and enhancing labour markets are areas of policy concerns...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} self-control, financial literacy and over-indebtedness on consumer credit debt among UK consumers. Lack of self-control and financial illiteracy are positively associated with non-payment of consumer credit and self-reported excessive financial burdens of debt. Consumers who exhibit self-control problems are shown to make greater use of quick-access but high cost credit items such as store cards and payday loans. We also find consumers with self-control problems {{are more likely to}} suffer income shocks, credit withdrawals and <b>unforeseen</b> <b>expenses</b> on durables, suggesting that lack of self-control increases exposure to a variety of risks. In most specifications we find a stronger role for lack of self-control than for financial illiteracy in explaining consumer over-indebtedness. We discuss the policy implications of these findings...|$|E
30|$|First of all, the child-rearing costs {{used for}} this study account for {{only a small portion of}} the overall cost that parents expect to pay when they raise their children. Thus, it might be {{problematic}} to connect this cost to making a decision in favor of childbirth. The child-rearing costs that potential parents consider when deciding to have a baby includes not only the direct expenses but also the overall child-rearing costs from birth to adulthood, including the psychological and <b>unforeseen</b> <b>expenses.</b> Therefore, the cost of early childhood is only a small proportion of this total. Especially, a small increase or decrease in the child-rearing costs has little impact on high-education and high-income groups. In addition, since the opportunity costs of the high-education and high-income group are larger than the low-education and low-income group, the potential overall cost that factors into a decision about childbirth is relatively larger and the proportion of direct expenses for early childhood goes down.|$|E
40|$|A large {{fraction}} of American families reach retirement age {{with virtually no}} personal financial assets. The median level of all personal financial assets of families with heads aged 55 - 64 was only $ 8, 300 in 1991; excluding individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and 401 (k) balances the median was only $ 3, 000. Mean values are substantially higher. Almost 20 percent of families had no financial assets at all. In 199 1, the median value of the future social security benefits of retired families with heads aged 65 - 70 was about $ 100, 000, the median value of housing was about $ 50, 000, and the median value of future employer-provided pension benefits was about $ 16, 000. But other than social security and pension benefits, and illiquid housing wealth, the typical family has very limited resources to meet <b>unforeseen</b> <b>expenses.</b> Two saving programs introduced in the early 1980 s were intended to encour-age individual saving.

40|$|It's TIme to Step Up is the {{companion}} report to "Not just a Roof Over our Heads". It reviews the ESPC's recommendations {{in response to}} the Edmonton Renters' Survey results. In June 2007 the Edmonton Social Planning Council (ESPC) made 13 recommendations to address the crisis in rental housing in the report A Roof Over their Heads. These recommendations were based on what we heard at two renters' listening forums held the previous month. The results of our Edmonton Renters' Survey, presented in the report Not Just a Roof Over our Heads, show that renters' situations have not improved over the past year despite the recent stabilization of the rental market. Many renters continue to have difficulties affording shelter and their other basic needs, and the persistent lack of affordable alternatives gives renters little control to change their situation. Low and modest income households are facing the greatest difficulties; wage increases have not kept pace with rent increases, leaving families less able to maintain a decent standard of living and putting them at greater risk of financial crisis (including the loss of their housing) in the event of <b>unforeseen</b> <b>expenses.</b> The survey results also highlight major concerns with housing maintenance and safety...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} comprises three self-contained {{essays in}} which I analyze {{the effects of}} consumer bankruptcy laws on household borrowing, interest rates, default decisions, and welfare in different institutional settings. Chapter 2 analyzes whether and how to regulate small dollar lending in the U. S. I show that lump-sum court filing fees prevent low-income households from filing for bankruptcy, causing them to become delinquent. In a policy experiment, I show that easier access to bankruptcy increases welfare of this group by 1 %. Chapter 3 evaluates the German bankruptcy system, which features relatively harsh wage garnishment. Since wage garnishment raises the effective marginal tax rate, it exhibits adverse effects on labor supply. Explicitly modeling labor supply, this paper documents the optimal garnishment regime for the German economy: garnishment rates are reduced by more than 25 %, while the duration of garnishment is increased from six to ten years. This results in an aggregate welfare increase of around 3. 3 %. Chapter 4 is joint work with Igor Livshits, James MacGee, and Michèle Tertilt. There is increased debate over whether the regulation of unsecured consumer lending products is required to protect some consumers from “over-borrowing. ” To assess the quantitative benefits of regulating the cost of declaring consumer bankruptcy, we analyze a life-cycle model where some consumers have excessively optimistic beliefs about their exposure to <b>unforeseen</b> <b>expenses...</b>|$|E
40|$|Managing {{the process}} of a product's {{development}} prior to its release is the dominant theme of this graduation thesis. In today's modern turbulent world, businesses compete {{to be a strong}} force in the market arena. From start to finish it is necessary to keep the consumer's demands and wants as the driving force when managing the operation. Factors that are critical in the implementation of the operation are working with a manageable portfolio, forecasting <b>unforeseen</b> <b>expenses,</b> profit gains and losses. Purchasing the most recent and efficient software program or electronics to assist in the operation could be more effective but more expensive upfront. On the other hand, purchasing a complex program or electronics will be ineffective if the user is unable to comprehend its complete functions or abilities. Proper and thorough analysis is necessary in foreseeing all possible obstacles to a smooth operation. Presently, {{it is not uncommon for}} companies to implement new technology without previous analysis. The result is a rapidly growing demand for a product reliant on this technology to help produce or support it. As a result, they find themselves in a tight spot very soon. Resolving the issue consists of additional and extended analyses of changes and in the reimplementation of the technology, a process that can be slow and tap into an already tight budget. In conclusion, this dissertation surmises that documentation of and organized implementation of processes in a real manufacturing corporation is necessary to improve not only the quality of processes in support of reaching economic targets but also in assuring quality labour performances of all employees...|$|E
40|$|This {{exploratory}} study investigated {{changes in the}} allocation of household expenditure between various product or service categories {{in a sample of}} South African low-income or 'bottom of the pyramid' (BoP) households. First, the mixed methods research quantified the monthly income and expenditure fluctuations in the sample of households over a period of four months. In addition, study identified and quantified expenditure category trade-offs in the target households. Finally, a qualitative inquiry explained the reasons for the fluctuations and the trade-offs identified in the first two components. The study was based on the existing BoP proposition and specifically focused on BoP consumer decision-making theory. Methodologically, the study was a monthly longitudinal panel over four months. The quantitative component employed a once-off baseline questionnaire to gather household data. The participating households then completed monthly self-complete financial diary questionnaires that recorded both income and expenditure. The qualitative component involved interviews with representatives from the participating households and provided details to explain the underlying causes for changes in monthly expenditure patterns. The study was conducted in four provinces with eighty BoP households participating in the research. The study found significant variation in both household income and expenditure between months. The variation and consequent trade-offs between expenditure categories was caused by calendar-related phenomena (such as the festive season), income shocks, <b>unforeseen</b> <b>expenses</b> and spreading the household budget over multiple months. In addition, large fluctuations in income resulted in a constantly shifting allocation of expenditure to categories that required the most attention at a particular point in time. Informal savings (stokvels) and micro-enterprise expenses also contributed to fluctuations in income and expenditure. This study provides unique insights that fill a vacuum in the current body of academic and industry knowledge for this segment of close to forty million BoP South Africans. No study of this nature has been published in either South African or international journals...|$|E
40|$|Distributed Software Development {{today is}} one of the most widely used and {{implemented}} software development strategies in the industry [1]. Some of the major advantages of this methodology are 24 hour work-cycle [2], increased diversity of resources, reduced labor costs, decreased time of iteration cycle and diverse skillset of the workforce [3]. Although it has proven to be quite efficient and practical, there are ample reasons from previous research [4][5] in this field that show that this development approach is uncertain in terms of quality of product developed, speed and expenses. Factors such as presence of multiple stakeholders, lack of effective communication among sites, cultural differences among the workforce and presence of a diverse range of system variables brings a level of uncertainty into the system. A method is required to simulate iterations of the software development lifecycle and understand the effect of changes in system variables/stakeholders involved. This would help project managers, business analysts and other parties involved from different sites to examine the effect of changes in one variable at any point to the other variables and inspect its short and long term consequence on the project plan and deliverables. Problems leading to faulty product development, failure in conforming to all the lifecycle requirements, decreased customer satisfaction, <b>unforeseen</b> <b>expenses</b> and inability to meet deadlines can be avoided by predicting changes using those predictions to make better decisions. In this thesis, I have created a simulated model of Distributed Software Development using the concept of System Dynamics [6]. My main purpose is to define the different variables, and stakeholders involved in this methodology. Furthermore, I aim to define relationships among them, analyze and draw sufficient conclusions that would help understand and decrease uncertainty. As an example, the results of the simulation show prediction of change of the number of customers, features released with time for the given product as other variables in the system change. This can help project directors, managers and leads to make better informed decisions about the steps they can take to maximize their product growth in the market...|$|E
