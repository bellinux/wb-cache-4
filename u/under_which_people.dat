25|$|Unger's {{critique}} of economics {{begins with the}} identification of a key moment in economic history, when the analysis of production and exchange turned away from social theory and engaged in a quest for scientific objectivity. In Ungerâ€™s analysis, classical economics focused on the causal relations among social activities, which were connected with the production and distribution of wealth. Classical economists asked questions about the true basis of value, activities that contributed to national wealth, systems of rights, or about the forms of government <b>under</b> <b>which</b> <b>people</b> grow rich. In the late-nineteenth century, in response to attacks from socialist ideas and debates about how society works, and {{as a means to}} escape the conundrums of value theory and to answer how values could become prices, marginalist economics arose. This movement in economics disengaged economics from prescriptive and normative commitments to withdraw the study of economies from debates about how society worked and what kind of society we wanted to live in. For Unger, this moment in the history of economics robbed it of any analytical or practical value.|$|E
500|$|Protection of {{life and}} {{personal}} liberty is also stated under right to life and personal liberty. Article 21 declares that no citizen can be denied his life and liberty except by law. This means that a person's life and personal liberty can be disputed only if that person has committed a crime. However, {{the right to life}} does not include the right to die and hence, suicide or an attempt thereof, is an offence. (Attempted suicide being interpreted as a crime has seen many debates. The Supreme Court of India gave a landmark ruling in 1994. The court repealed section 309 of the Indian penal code, <b>under</b> <b>which</b> <b>people</b> attempting suicide could face prosecution and prison terms of up to one year. In 1996 however another Supreme Court ruling nullified the earlier one.) [...] "Personal liberty" [...] includes all the freedoms which are not included in Article 19 (that is, the six freedoms). The right to travel abroad is also covered under [...] "personal liberty" [...] in Article 21.|$|E

Its article 5 provides that everyone has the right to liberty and sets forth permissible circumstances <b>under</b> <b>which</b> <b>people</b> may be deprived of their liberty and procedural safeguards in case of detention.

5000|$|Social {{cognitive}} theory suggests an interactionist perspective to morality. People {{do not operate}} as autonomous moral agents unaffected by the social realities {{in which they are}} embedded, and hence moral agency is socially situated. Moral agency is exercised in [...] "particularized ways" [...] depending on the conditions <b>under</b> <b>which</b> <b>people's</b> everyday life transactions are taking place. According to this view, moral actions are therefore the outcome of this reciprocal interplay of personal and social influences. Social {{cognitive theory}} lists three different modes of human agency, personal, proxy and collective.|$|R

6000|$|I daresay {{there are}} now near five hundred people in Dobbo of various races, all met in this remote corner of the East, as they express it, [...] "to look for their fortune;" [...] to get money any way they can. They are most of them {{people who have the}} very worst {{reputation}} for honesty as well as every other form of morality,--Chinese, Bugis, Ceramese, and half-caste Javanese, with a sprinkling of half-wild Papuans from Timor, Babber, and other islands, yet all goes on as yet very quietly. This motley, ignorant, bloodthirsty, thievish population live here without the shadow of a government, with no police, no courts, and no lawyers; yet they do not cut each other's throats, do not plunder each other day and night, do not fall into the anarchy such a state of things might be supposed to lead to. It is very extraordinary! It puts strange thoughts into one's head about the mountain-load of government <b>under</b> <b>which</b> <b>people</b> exist in Europe, and suggests the idea that we may be over-governed. Think of the hundred Acts of Parliament annually enacted to prevent us, the people of England, from cutting each other's throats, or from doing to our neighbour as we would not be done by. Think of the thousands of lawyers and barristers whose whole lives are spent in telling us what the hundred Acts of Parliament mean, and one would be led to infer that if Dobbo has too little law England has too much.|$|E
6000|$|The Eugenists get {{the ear of}} {{the humane}} but rather hazy cliques {{by saying that the}} present [...] "conditions" [...] <b>under</b> <b>which</b> <b>people</b> work and breed are bad for the race; but the modern mind will not {{generally}} stretch beyond one step of reasoning, and the consequence which appears to follow on the consideration of these [...] "conditions" [...] is by no means what would originally have been expected. If somebody says: [...] "A rickety cradle may mean a rickety baby," [...] the natural deduction, one would think, would be to give the people a good cradle, or give them money enough to buy one. But that means higher wages and greater equalisation of wealth; and the plutocratic scientist, with a slightly troubled expression, turns his eyes and pince-nez in another direction. Reduced to brutal terms of truth, his difficulty is this and simply this: More food, leisure, and money for the workman would mean a better workman, better even {{from the point of view}} of anyone for whom he worked. But more food, leisure, and money would also mean a more independent workman. A house with a decent fire and a full pantry would be a better house to make a chair or mend a clock in, even from the customer's point of view, than a hovel with a leaky roof and a cold hearth. But a house with a decent fire and a full pantry would also be a better house in which to refuse to make a chair or mend a clock--a much better house to do nothing in--and doing nothing is sometimes one of the highest of the duties of man. All but the hard-hearted must be torn with pity for this pathetic dilemma of the rich man, who has to keep the poor man just stout enough to do the work and just thin enough to have to do it. As he stood gazing at the leaky roof and the rickety cradle in a pensive manner, there one day came into his mind a new and curious idea--one of the most strange, simple, and horrible ideas that have ever risen from the deep pit of original sin.|$|E

5000|$|Acting under a {{description}} {{has important implications}} for interpreting our selves. Self-understanding involves understanding our acts and hence understanding the descriptions under which we act. This issue has been illustrated with discussions of particular cases such as autism and multiple personality disorder. In contemporary society, the descriptions <b>under</b> <b>which</b> <b>people</b> act constitute the kind of act and {{the kind of person that}} commits the act. By illustration, a child pushes another child in the playground. If asked why he did that, he might answer [...] "to show who's boss", [...] "because I have ADHD", or [...] "because I was provoked". Hacking is not concerned with which description best suits the act, but rather, how the descriptions <b>under</b> <b>which</b> <b>people</b> act depend on the descriptions available to them.|$|E
50|$|Attribution biases {{were first}} {{discussed}} in the 1950s and 60s by psychologists such as Fritz Heider, who studied attribution theory.
