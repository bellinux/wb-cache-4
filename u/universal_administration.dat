40|$|Acute {{otitis media}} {{in an era}} of {{increasing}} antimicrobial resistance and <b>universal</b> <b>administration</b> of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine STEPHEN I. PELTON, MD The last decade has witnessed a shift in the epidemiology of acute otitis media (AOM) with an earlier onset of disease and a greater propor-tion of children with recurrent episodes before 1 year of age. In addition antimicrobial resistance to beta-lactams, macrolides and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole among otopathogens has in-creased significantly. Most recently universal ad-ministration of a seven valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has been endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Advi-sory Committee on Immunization Practices. Ear-lier onset of disease and the decrease in antimi-crobial susceptibility among pediatric respiratory bacterial pathogens is likely to in-crease the risk of failure among young children with AOM. A seven valent pneumococcal conju-gate vaccine (PCV 7) has demonstrated efficacy for prevention of serotype-specific pneumococ-cal otitis; however, increase in disease caused by nonvaccine serotypes and Haemophilus influen-zae has been reported. With these events as the background, I have reviewed the strategies most likely to be successful for the treatment of AOM in 2002...|$|E

40|$|Probiotics for the {{prevention}} of necrotizing enterocolitis have attracted a huge interest. Combined data from heterogeneous randomised controlled trials suggest that probiotics may decrease the incidence of NEC. However, the individual studies use a variety of probiotic products, and the group at greatest risk of NEC, i. e., those with a birth weight of less than 1000 g, is relatively under-represented in these trials so we do not have adequate evidence of either efficacy or safety to recommend <b>universal</b> prophylactic <b>administration</b> of probiotics to premature infants. These problems have polarized neonatologists, with some taking the view that it is unethical not to universally administer probiotics to premature infants, whereas others regard the meta-analyses as flawed and that there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine probiotic administration. Another problem is that the mechanism by which probiotics might act is not clear, although some experimental evidence is starting to accumulate. This may allow development of surrogate endpoints of effectiveness, refinement of probiotic regimes, or even development of pharmacological agents that may act through the same mechanism. Hence, although routine probiotic administration is controversial, studies of probiotic effects may ultimately lead us to effective means to prevent this devastating diseas...|$|R

40|$|Global Tuberculosis (TB) report (2013) has {{revealed}} that an estimated 8. 6 million people developed TB of which, India accounts for almost 26 % of the cases. These estimates clearly suggest that the country’s efforts to achieve Millennium Development Goal 6 by 2015 have not delivered the desired output. In India, the TB prevention and control activities are supervised and implemented under the Revised National TB Control Program (RNTCP), which recognizes that implementation of a good quality Directly Observed Treatment with Short course chemotherapy (DOTS) is the first priority for TB control. Directly Observed Treatment (DOT) is the key element in DOTS strategy, in which a DOT provider insures and supports the patients in consuming their drugs {{throughout the course of}} treatment.

This study was aimed at determining the prevalence of faecal carriage of fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli strains before TRUSPB and at evaluating potential predisposing risk factors. The incidence of sepsis after prostate biopsy was determined, and our routine practice for antibiotic prophylaxis for TRUSPB was evaluated. A prospective {{study was conducted in}} 342 consecutive patients undergoing prostate biopsy between December 2009 and July 2010. Before TRUSPB, a rectal swab was cultured. The correlation between the presence of fluoroquinolone-resistant strains and plausible risk factors was investigated by the use of a questionnaire. Of the 236 patients included, 22. 0 % (52 / 236) harboured ciprofloxacin-resistant E.  coli strains. The use of fluoroquinolones in the 6  months before biopsy was associated with an increased risk of faecal carriage of fluoroquinolone-resistant E.  coli strains (p < 0. 01). Faecal carriage of fluoroquinolone-resistant E.  coli strains was an important risk factor for infectious complications after TRUSPB (p < 0. 01). In conclusion, a significant number of patients have faecal carriage of fluoroquinolone-resistant E.  coli strains (22. 0 %) before TRUSPB. The use of fluoroquinolones in the previous 6  months before biopsy is a risk factor for faecal carriage of fluoroquinolone-resistant E.  coli strains and for infectious complications after TRUSPB.

With the rise {{of resistance to the}} {{antimalarial drug}} sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), mefloquine is now being considered as a replacement for SP for <b>universal</b> antenatal <b>administration</b> to women from malaria-endemic regions. Recent recommendations have also suggested that mefloquine may be used cautiously among pregnant travelers who cannot otherwise avoid visiting these areas. Mefloquine has been demonstrated to cause blockade of gap junction protein alpha 1 (GJA 1) gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC), and recent evi-dence suggests that GJA 1 GJIC is critical to successful embryonic implantation and early placental development. During routine use, mefloquine accumulates in organ and peripheral tissue, crosses the blood-placental barrier, and may plausibly accumulate in developing decidua and trophoblast at concentrations sufficient to interfere with GJA 1 GJIC and, thus, cause deleterious effects on fetal outcomes. This conclusion is supported by epidemiological evidence that demonstrates use of the drug during early development is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage and stillbirth. Confirmatory studies are pending, but the available experimental and epidemiological evidence support renewed adherence, where feasible, to existing mefloquine package insert guidance that women avoid the drug during the periconceptional period. decidua, placenta, placental transport, toxicology, trophoblas...|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins ""Universal service" means providing residential customers with affordable, nationwide access to basic phone service. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 extended support for universal service to eligible schools, libraries, and rural health care providers. Universal service programs are generally funded by mandatory contributions from telecommunications companies. New technologies, however, are putting this funding source in jeopardy. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has issued many orders designed to implement the act's universal service reforms. The <b>Universal</b> Service <b>Administration</b> Company runs the day-to-day operations of federal universal service programs on FCC's behalf, although FCC retains responsibility for oversight and ensuring compliance with its rules. At the state level, public utility commissions generally regulate rates for local and long-distance phone service and implement universal service programs. Public utility commissions subsidize local phone service from the rates set for urban and business phone service and for "vertical" services, such as caller ID and call waiting. Although the use of digital technologies and internet protocol networks for communications has risen rapidly during the past decade, the providers of these services {{are not required to}} contribute to the universal service fund. As these new voice services gain in popularity, funding for universal service may begin to decline. Considerable debate has arisen over whether the current regulatory framework for funding universal service [...] which relies on interstate telecommunications revenue [...] should be revised in light of digital communications. ...|$|R

The {{objective}} of this quality standard is to prevent nosocomial transmission of measles by assuring universal measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination of all health care workers who lack immunity to measles. Although the primary emphasis is on health care workers in hospitals, those at other sites, such as clinics, nursing homes, and schools, are also in-cluded. It will be the responsibility of designated individuals at these institutions to implement the standard. Options. We considered advocating the use of measles vac-cine rather than MMR vaccine but chose the latter because it also protects against mumps and rubella {{and because it is}} more readily available. Outcomes. The desired outcome is a reduction in the nosoco-mial transmission of measles. Evidence. Although direct comparative studies are lacking, nosocomial outbreaks of measles have been reported (as recently as 1992) in institutions where measles immunization of nonim-mune health care workers is not universal, whereas such out-breaks have not been reported in institutions with universal im-munization. Values and Validation. We consulted more than 50 in-fectious-disease experts from the fields of epidemiology, govern-ment, medicine, nursing, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, and surgery.

40|$|Prolonged {{infusion}} of β-lactam antibiotics as either extended (over at least 2 hours) or continuous infusion is increasingly applied {{in intensive care}} units {{around the world in}} an attempt to optimise treatment with this most commonly used class of antibiotics, whose effectiveness is challenged by increasing resistance rates. The pharmacokinetics of β-lactam antibiotics in critically ill patients is profoundly altered secondary to an increased volume of distribution and the presence of altered renal function, including augmented renal clearance. This may lead to a significant decrease in plasma concentrations of β-lactam antibiotics. As a consequence, low pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target attainment, which is described as the percentage of time that the free drug concentration is maintained above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the causative organism (fT<MIC), has been documented for β-lactam treatment in these patients when using standard intermittent bolus dosing, even for the most conservative target (50 % fT<MIC). Prolonged {{infusion of}} β-lactams has consistently been shown to improve PK/PD target attainment, particularly in patients with severe infections. However, evidence regarding relevant patient outcomes is still limited. Whereas previous observational studies have suggested a clinical benefit of prolonged infusion, results from two recent randomised controlled trials of continuous infusion versus intermittent bolus administration of β-lactams are conflicting. In particular, the larger, double-blind placebo-controlled randomised controlled trial including 443 patients did not demonstrate any difference in clinical outcomes. We believe that a personalised approach is required to truly optimise β-lactam treatment in critically ill patients. This may include therapeutic drug monitoring with real-time adaptive feedback, rapid MIC determination and the use of antibiotic dosing software tools that incorporate patient parameters, dosing history, drug concentration and site of infection. <b>Universal</b> <b>administration</b> of β-lactam antibiotics as prolonged infusion, even if supported by therapeutic drug monitoring, is not yet ready for "prime time", as evidence for its clinical benefit is modest.

40|$|Youth {{substance}} {{use is a}} leading public health concern in the United States. The U. S. spends over $ 700 {{billion a year in}} alcohol, tobacco, and drug-related problems associated with health, crime, and lost productivity in the workplace. i Because most {{substance use}} concerns manifest in adolescence and the young adult years, evidence-based prevention and early intervention strategies for youth are particularly vital to reducing the burden of substance use on individuals, families, and communities. In recent years, policies and services implemented {{as a result of the}} Affordable Care Act have significantly impacted primary care and behavioral health delivery systems by emphasizing the value of preventive services, promoting models for primary care and behavioral health integration, engaging communities in population health strategies, and increasing access to substance use and mental health services. Capitalizing on this momentum, the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation's (the Foundation's) Youth Substance Use Prevention and Early Intervention Strategic Initiative (Strategic Initiative) is leading a movement in how people think about, talk about, and address youth substance use. This initiative is laying the groundwork for long-term change through communications and advocacy, preparing the workforce, promoting evidence-based practices, and aligning services across physical health care, behavioral health systems, and community supports nationwide. The Strategic Initiative is designed to advance the understanding of substance use as a health issue by implementing screening and early intervention approaches to prevent and reduce substance use among youth as part of routine practice in health care and other settings where youth receive services. The Strategic Initiative's work is centered around a public health, population-based approach of screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT). Screening refers to the routine, <b>universal</b> <b>administration</b> of validated questions to identify potential risk related to alcohol and drug use, followed by positive reinforcement for youth who screen as 'no' or 'low' risk. Brief intervention is one or more short, motivational conversations, typically incorporating feedback, advice, and goal setting around decreasing 'moderate' risk related to substance use. Referral to treatment describes the process of connecting individuals with problematic use ('high' risk) to appropriate assessment, treatment, and/or additional services based on their level of need. The intent of the SBIRT process is to identify and address substance use and related risks– including health, social, and legal consequences attributed to substance use– through developmentally appropriate interventions or referrals to other services when indicated. Historically, youth substance use has been solely addressed through prevention interventions focused on abstinence or substance use disorder services provided through traditional specialty treatment systems. The SBIRT framework addresses the gap between primary prevention and treatment for disorders by identifying use and potential risk early and intervening before the use of alcohol or drugs leads to more serious consequences...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} was {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of low-dose, long-term antibiotics for the prevention of symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) in children. Design: This was a systematic review of randomized controlled trials with a random effects model meta-analysis. Participants: Five trials involving 463 children were performed. Results: Three trials (n = 392) evaluated the effectiveness of long treatment courses of antibiotics (2 to 6 months) for children with acute UTI to prevent subsequent, off-treatment infection. Only 2 trials (n = 71) evaluated the effectiveness of long-term, low-dose antibiotics to prevent on-treatment UTI. Very few of the children enrolled in the trials were boys, had abnormal renal tracts, or were infants. The trial quality was poor, with a lack of blinding, and unstated UTI definitions were almost <b>universal.</b> Long-term antibiotic <b>administration</b> reduced the risk of UTI with treatment (relative risk 0. 31, 95 % confidence limits 0. 10 to 1. 00), but there was significant heterogeneity (Q = 13. 45, P <. 01), and there was no sustained benefit once antibiotics had ceased (relative risk 0. 79, 0. 61 to 1. 02).

40|$|Thesis (LLM (Import and Export Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 Due to {{economic}} globalisation and integration, {{as well as}} the global economic downturn since 2008, the appearance of cross-border insolvencies have increased dramatically. This increase in cross-border insolvencies has led to a demand for a general and fair system to administer cross-border insolvencies globally. In 1997 United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) promulgated the Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency to act as an aide to countries in globally administering cross-border insolvencies in a uniform way. South Africa, and the United States of America (USA), subsequently accepted this Model Law approach into their respective national legislation. South Africa did this through the Cross-Border Insolvency Act 42 of 2000 (CBIA) and the USA by way of Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The CBIA is, however, not currently in operation as the Minister of Justice has not yet designated countries to which the CBIA will apply. Chapter 15 is, however, effective and operational in the USA. The two theories that underlie cross-border insolvencies – universalism and territorialism – have been further refined in the theories of modern universalism and modern territorialism. Supporters of modern universalism hailed the acceptance of the Model Law into the national legislation of countries as a victory over modern territorialism as the characteristics of modern universalism can be found throughout the Model Law. Modern universalism is, however, seen as theory which endangers the interests of local creditors as it favours <b>universal</b> <b>administration</b> of assets. However, modern territorialism is, on the other hand, acknowledged to protect the interests of local creditors. Therefore an investigation into the application of Chapter 15 by the courts of the USA will indicate if the interests of local creditors are sufficiently protected under this so-called modern universalistic approach and, if indeed so, how this is achieved. As the CBIA is neither operational nor effective in South Africa, cross-border insolvencies are governed by the common law and the precedents set down in case law. Writers and case law indicate that South Africa uses a system that can be described as between pure territorialism and modern territorialism. It can therefore be accepted that South Africa currently protects the interests of its local creditors sufficiently. The question then arises if, when South Africa made the CBIA effective and operational, would local creditors‟ interests still be sufficiently protected? As the CBIA and Chapter 15 are both based on the Model Law, they are basically identical in most aspects. Therefore an investigation into the application of Chapter 15 will also indicate if the CBIA will sufficiently protect the interests of local creditors. This dissertation thus attempts, through an investigation of the applications lodged under Chapter 15, to indicate that the USA still succeeds in protecting the interests of its local creditors. The USA achieves this through utilising mechanisms made available through Chapter 15 itself. Consequently this dissertation shows that South Africa can make the CBIA operational, while still sufficiently protecting the interests of its local creditors. Master...|$|E
