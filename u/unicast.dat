40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the application of}} non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to a multi-user network with mixed multicasting and <b>unicasting</b> traffic. The proposed design of beamforming and power allocation ensures that the <b>unicasting</b> performance is improved while maintaining the reception reliability of multicasting. Both analytical and simulation results are provided {{to demonstrate that the}} use of the NOMA assisted multicast-unicast scheme yields a significant improvement in spectral efficiency compared to orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes which realize multicasting and <b>unicasting</b> services separately. Since <b>unicasting</b> messages are broadcasted to all the users, how the use of NOMA can prevent those multicasting receivers intercepting the <b>unicasting</b> messages is also investigated, where it is shown that the secrecy <b>unicasting</b> rate achieved by NOMA is always larger than or equal to that of OMA. This security gain is mainly {{due to the fact that}} the multicasting messages can be used as jamming signals to prevent potential eavesdropping when the multicasting and <b>unicasting</b> messages are superimposed together following the NOMA principle...|$|R

2500|$|OSPF {{supports}} complex networks {{with multiple}} routers, including backup routers, to balance traffic load on multiple {{links to other}} subnets. Neighboring routers in the same broadcast domain or {{at each end of}} a point-to-point telecommunications communicate with each other via the OSPF protocol. Routers form adjacencies when they have detected each other. This detection is initiated when a router identifies itself in a Hello protocol packet. Upon acknowledgment, this establishes a two-way state and the most basic relationship. The routers in an Ethernet or Frame Relay network select a Designated Router (DR) and a Backup Designated Router (BDR) which act as a hub to reduce traffic between routers. OSPF uses both <b>unicast</b> and multicast transmission modes to send [...] "Hello" [...] packets and link state updates.|$|E

The first scheme {{is based on}} <b>unicasting</b> from the base station, whereas the second is based on threshold based multicasting. Long Term Evolution (LTE) is used for long range (LR) communications with the base station (BS) and IEEE 802. 11 p is considered for inter-vehicle collaboration on the short range (SR). The first scheme is shown to outperform non-cooperative <b>unicasting</b> and multicasting, while the second scheme outperforms non-cooperative <b>unicasting</b> beyond a specific number of cooperating vehicles, when the appropriate 802. 11 p power class is used.

50|$|The {{most common}} {{concept of an}} IP address is in <b>unicast</b> addressing, {{available}} in both IPv4 and IPv6. It normally refers to a single sender or a single receiver, {{and can be used}} for both sending and receiving. Usually, a <b>unicast</b> address is associated with a single device or host, but a device or host may have more than one <b>unicast</b> address. Some individual PCs have several distinct <b>unicast</b> addresses, each for its own distinct purpose. Sending the same data to multiple <b>unicast</b> addresses requires the sender to send all the data many times over, once for each recipient.|$|E

40|$|Currently, the {{communication}} protocols for the World Wide Web {{are based on}} a form of <b>unicasting</b> called the Transport Control Protocol (TCP). One of the assumptions of <b>unicasting,</b> which is point-to-point only, is that the address of the remote endpoint is known in advance. This assumption, however, severely constrains the design of web information systems by forcing them to accept certain compromises, such as being highly centralized. This paper proposes the use of multicast as an underlying technology on which more robust web applications can be based. By using multicast, web information systems gain flexibility and shed the constraints imposed by <b>unicasting.</b> We also describe Jambalaya, a web information system that is based on the multicast protocol and demonstrates these ideas in two ways: by allowing users to perform sender-blind broadcasting of information requests, and by allowing information servers to perform sender-blind advertising of their most-often requested information. 1 [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Five {{types of}} {{wireless}} link modules were proposed, including broadcast, peer-to-peer <b>unicast,</b> multicast, to-sink <b>unicast,</b> and data aggregation, respectively. Other arbitrary types of modules may be added, establishing {{other types of}} abstract wireless links without limitation. For example, the broadcast module simply disseminates data packets to surrounding nodes. The peer-to-peer <b>unicast</b> module can deliver data packets from source to destination over multiple wireless hops. The multicast module sends data packets to multiple destinations, as compared to peer-to-peer <b>unicast.</b> The to-sink <b>unicast</b> module can be especially useful in wireless sensor networks, which utilizes higher capabilities of data collectors (or sinks), so as to achieve better data delivery. The data-aggregation module opportunistically collects and aggregates the context related data from a set of proximity wireless nodes.|$|E
