40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the new version}} (1. 2) of the “Ice” software designed for calculating the sea ice area of different cohesion according to pentad (once in five days) archival maps of the ice cover of the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan, based on remote Earth-sensing data in the <b>universal</b> <b>polar</b> <b>stereographic</b> <b>projection</b> (UPS) and published in free access by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) after each ice season since 1971. In the process of modifying the basic version of the software an additional possibility of processing operational ice map-schemes, which are being published operatively on the JMA website between December and May twice a week (on Tuesday and Friday) in a transversely cylindrical Mercator projection, has been added. Functions of creating zoning masks for calculating ice massif area according to operational map-schemes in regions with arbitrary borders for samples of any length and periodicity have been added. The possibility of calculating the volume of ice is realized by taking into consideration the average thickness of the ice massif in the selected area, which is calculated by the ice expert according to satellite imagery in the visible and infrared ranges. The description of formats of files with initial and target data containing information about zoning, thickness of ice, area of ice cover of various cohesion has been given. A technique for creating masks for regions with a fixed ice thickness on operational maps is described. Formulas and basic parameters for calculating the volume of ice in selected areas with arbitrary borders {{in the waters of}} the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan are given...|$|E

These values were then codified based on snow presence determined by both sensors (code = 10), CDR only (11), SSMI(S) only (12), and no snow (20). For this research, we assumed that a positive snow code from either or both sensors indicated snow presence, and made our snow or no snow determination accordingly.

This algorithm transforms the raw slant range image, generated by the signal processor, into a map registered product, resampled to either Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) or <b>Polar</b> <b>Stereographic</b> <b>projections,</b> and corrected for foreshortening. The technique utilizes the space platform trajectory information {{in conjunction with a}} digital elevation map (DEM) of the target area to generate an ortho-radar map with near-autonomous operation. The current procedure requires only two to three tie-points to compensate for the platform position uncertainty that results in translational error between the image and the DEM. This approach is unique in that it does not require generation of a simulated radar image from the DEM or a grid of tie-points to characterize the image-to-map distortions. Rather, it models the inherent distortions based on knowledge of the radar data collection characteristics, the signal Doppler parameters, and the local terrain height to automatically predict the registration transformation.

40|$|The passive {{continental}} margin off east Greenland {{has been shaped}} by tectonic and sedimentary processes, and typical physiographic patterns have evolved {{over the past few}} million years {{under the influence of the}} late Cenozoic Northern Hemisphere glaciations. The Greenland ice shield has been particularly affected. GLORIA (Geological Long Range Inclined Asdic), the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences' (IOS) long-range, side-scan sonar, was used on a 1992 RV Livonia cruise to map large-scale changes in sedimentary patterns along the east Greenland {{continental margin}}. The overall objective of this research program was to determine the variety of large-scale seafloor processes to improve our understanding of the interaction between ice sheets, current regimes, and sedimentary processes.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a climate-data record (CDR) of "clear-sky" ice-surface temperature (IST) of the Greenland Ice Sheet using Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The CDR provides daily and monthly-mean IST from March 2000 through December 2010 on a <b>polar</b> <b>stereographic</b> <b>projection</b> at a resolution of 6. 25 km. The CDR is amenable to extension into the future using Visible/Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data. Regional "clear-sky" surface temperature increases since the early 1980 s in the Arctic, measured using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) infrared data, range from 0. 57 +/- 0. 02 to 0. 72 +/- 0. 1 c per decade. Arctic warming {{has important implications for}} ice-sheet mass balance because much of the periphery of the Greenland Ice Sheet is already near O C during the melt season, and is thus vulnerable to rapid melting if temperatures continue to increase. An increase in melting of the ice sheet would accelerate sea-level rise, an issue affecting potentially billions of people worldwide. The IST CDR will provide a convenient data set for modelers and for climatologists to track changes of the surface temperature of the ice sheet as a whole and of the individual drainage basins on the ice sheet. The daily and monthly maps will provide information on surface melt as well as "clear-sky" temperature. The CDR will be further validated by comparing results with automatic-weather station data and with satellite-derived surface-temperature products...|$|R

The DEM consists a total area of ~ 125, 000 km 2 covering the Institute, Möller and Foundation ice streams and the Bungenstock Ice Rise with a 1 km spatial resolution. In order to produce the bed elevation DEM, ice thickness DEM was formed from the available radio-echo sounding (RES) data using the 'Topo to Raster' function in ArcGIS. The RES data {{used in this study}} were compiled from four main sources which are (1) Scott Polar Research Institute (SPRI) survey collected during several campaigns in the 1970 s (Drewry, 1983), (2) British Antarctic Survey (BAS) airborne radar survey conducted during the austal summer 2006 / 07 (GRADES/IMAGE) (Ashmore et al., 2014)., (3) BAS airborne survey accomplished during the Institute and Möller Antarctic Funding Initiative (IMAFI) in 2010 / 2011 (Ross et al., 2012) and (4) Center for the Remote Sensing of Ice Sheet (CReSIS) data during the NASA Operation IceBridge (OIB) programme in 2012 and 2014 (Gogineni, 2012). The ice thickness picks were gridded at a uniform 1 -km spacing using the Nearest Neighbour interpolation within the Topo to Raster. The ice thickness DEM was later subtracted from the 1 -km ice-sheet surface elevation derived from the combined European Remote Sensing Satellite- 1 (ERS- 1) radar and Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) laser satellite altimetry DEM (Bamber et al., 2009), to produce the bed topography referenced to the <b>Polar</b> <b>Stereographic</b> <b>projection</b> (Snyder, 1987) ...|$|R
40|$|This program {{produces}} the Gauss-Kruger (constant meridional scale) Transverse Mercator Projection {{which is used}} to construct the U. S. Army's Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Grid System. The method is capable of mapping the entire northern hemisphere of the earth (and, by symmetry of the projection, the entire earth) accurately with respect to a single principal meridian, and is therefore mathematically insensitive to proximity either to the pole or the equator, or to the departure of the meridian from the central meridian. This program could be useful to any map-making agency. The program overcomes the limitations of the "series" method (Thomas, 1952) presently used to compute the UTM Grid, specifically its complicated derivation, non-convergence near the pole, lack of rigorous error analysis, and difficulty of obtaining increased accuracy. The method is based on the principle that the parametric colatitude of a point is the amplitude of the Elliptic Integral of the 2 nd Kind, and this (irreducible) integral is the desired projection. Thus, a specification of the colatitude leads, most directly (and with strongest motivation) to a formulation in terms of amplitude. The most difficult problem to be solved was setting up the method so that the Elliptic Integral of the 2 nd Kind could be used elsewhere than on the principal meridian. The point to be mapped is specified in conventional geographic coordinates (geodetic latitude and longitudinal departure from the principal meridian). Using the colatitude (complement of latitude) and the longitude (departure), the initial step is to map the point to the North <b>Polar</b> <b>Stereographic</b> <b>Projection.</b> The closed-form, analytic function that coincides with the North <b>Polar</b> <b>Stereographic</b> <b>Projection</b> of the spheroid along the principal meridian is put into a Newton-Raphson iteration that solves for the tangent of one half the parametric colatitude, generalized to the complex plane. Because the parametric colatitude is the amplitude of the (irreducible) Incomplete Elliptic Integral of the 2 nd Kind, the value for the tangent of one half the amplitude of the Elliptic Integral of the 2 nd Kind is now known. The elliptic integral may now be computed by any desired method, and the result will be the Gauss-Kruger Transverse Mercator Projection. This result is a consequence of the fact that these steps produce a computation of real distance along the image (in the plane) of the principal meridian, and an analytic continuation of the distance at points that don't lie on the principal meridian. The elliptic-integral method used by this program is one of the "transformations of the elliptic integral" (similar to Landen's Transformation), appearing in standard handbooks of mathematical functions. Only elementary transcendental functions are utilized. The program output is the conventional (as used by the mapping agencies) cartesian coordinates, in meters, of the Transverse Mercator projection. The origin is at the intersection of the principal meridian and the equator. This FORTRAN 77 program was developed on an IBM PC series computer equipped with an Intel Math Coprocessor. Double precision complex arithmetic and transcendental functions are needed to support a projection accuracy of 1 mm. Because such functions are not usually part of the FORTRAN library, the needed functions have been explicitly programmed and included in the source code. The program was developed in 1989.
