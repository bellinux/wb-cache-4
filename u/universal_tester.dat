40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF Jacob Boone, for the Master of Science {{degree in}} Mechanical Engineering, {{presented}} on 10 / 28 / 2010, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, AND EVALUTAION OF <b>UNIVERSAL</b> FRICTION <b>TESTER</b> MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Peter Filip Many {{different types of}} friction testers are currently available for testing specific frictional applications. Of these machines very few have versatility, and {{of the ones that}} do, the amount of versatility is limited. Since friction is a property specific to each system, all operating parameters need to match the specific application as closely as possible in order to obtain accurate data. This requires many research facilities to have several specific friction testers in order to provide the necessary testing capabilities. The goal of this project was to design a <b>Universal</b> Friction <b>Tester</b> (UFT) with enough versatility to reproduce most types of sliding friction situations. This was accomplished by providing a wide range of testing capabilities through the use of interchangeable system components. Results show that the UFT provides quality data over its entire operating range. It was shown that normal pressure, sliding speed, temperature and system stiffness all have drastic effects on frictional performance. By using a borosilicate glass disc, the friction surface was viewed in-situ during testing. This allowed insights into true surface temperature and contact area. In conclusion, the UFT can successfully take the place of several friction testers and thus provide many friction research capabilities while requiring fewer resources. The wide range of testing capabilities will allow the UFT {{to be used as a}} research tool for many types of advanced friction studies. Some of these may include true surface temperatures, true contact area, influence of conditions on stick-slip phenomenon, and thermo-elastic instabilities...|$|R

The association of horizontal load-displacement and conditions of attachment loss was measured in triplicate for each anatomical tooth model at 10 -minute intervals, using a <b>universal</b> <b>tester</b> at a crosshead speed of 0. 05 mm/min, and a load of 0. 1 N.

Tensile strength and hardness tests were carried out using Instron <b>Universal</b> <b>Tester</b> and Vickers hardness methods, respectively. Results obtained from the experiment were presented graphically. The results showed that palm kernel oil cools faster at 200 °C and 250 °C, while palm oil and shea butter oil quench faster at 300 °C and 350 °C, respectively. Palm kernel oil offers the highest elongation at 200 °C, while at 350 °C shea butter oil gave the best result. The best among the bio-quenching oils in providing good ductility is shea butter oil at 200 °C, while at 300 °C and 350 °C groundnut oil give the best result. Highest hardness values were obtained from samples quenched in melon oil between 200 °C- 300 °C. However, these values decreased with increased heating temperature probably due to density and viscosity variation with temperature rise. Similar observations were made on most of other samples quenched in other bio-quenching oils used in this experiment.

Tan δ was measured using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) over a range of frequency (0. 01 – 130 Hz), strain amplitude (0. 1 – 4. 5 %), and temperature (− 100 – 50 °C). Energy dissipated was measured using a <b>universal</b> <b>tester</b> under cyclic tensile loading. The chosen antivibration rubbers for comparison contained different contents of carbon black filler (30, 50 and 70 phr) in a natural rubber matrix. It was found that energy absorption for comparative samples was generally higher than isotropic and anisotropic MREs over the range of frequency and strain amplitude explored, {{as well as in}} hysteresis testing and this was believed to be largely due the presence of carbon black in the formulation. Further assessment was carried out on materials that were the same as anisotropic MREs except they had additions of carbon black. The energy absorption was found higher than comparative samples with the same carbon black contents, supporting the use of iron sand to improve damping. However, trends for energy absorption at around Tg were found to reverse which is considered to be due to the segmental motion of rubber chains being by far the most significant influence on energy absorption in the glass transition zone...|$|E
