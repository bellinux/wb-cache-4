25|$|All {{processes}} in organisms obey physical laws, the difference from inanimate processes lying in their organisation and their being subject to control by coded information. This {{has led some}} biologists and philosophers (for example, Ernst Mayr and David Hull) {{to return to the}} strictly philosophical reflections of Charles Darwin to resolve some of the problems which confronted them when they tried to employ a philosophy of science derived from classical physics. This latter, positivist approach emphasised a strict determinism (as opposed to high probability) and to the discovery of <b>universally</b> <b>applicable</b> laws, testable in the course of experiment. It was difficult for biology, beyond a basic microbiological level, to live up to these structures.

Networking posed another problem. Even if network communication can be compared to file access, the low-level packet-oriented architecture dealt with discrete chunks of data and not with whole files. As the capability of computers grew, Unix became increasingly cluttered with code. It is also because the modularity of the Unix kernel is extensively scalable. While kernels might have had 100,000 lines of code in the seventies and eighties, kernels of modern Unix successors like Linux have more than 13 million lines.|$|E

This paper presents a review of two different methods; Meyerhof and Patra & Pise for predicting lateral resistance of pile. Then, the predicted ultimate lateral resistances by these two methods are compared with the experimental results. It is found that Meyerhof’s method gives better prediction for single pile with smaller L/d ratio whereas Patra & Pise method gives better predictions for pile groups with higher L/d. Thus, none of these methods can be <b>applicable</b> <b>universally</b> for all possible conditions. Also the parametric study on ultimate lateral resistance revealed that length to diameter ratio, pile spacing, pile configuration in a pile group are important parameters for prediction of lateral load resistance...|$|R

In situations like this, designing customisable methods that fit characteristics of migration scenarios would be pivotal for successful adoption of cloud computing. The literature review reveals that issues surrounding method tailoring for the cloud migration have so far been missing and this is despite the call made by previous researches to adopt a tailoring perspective to the cloud enablement. To effectively address this shortcoming, this study applied the idea of situational method engineering to develop a framework which facilitates the design and maintenance of bespoke cloud migration methods.

40|$|Lower Palaeozoic and Precambrian {{rocks are}} {{distributed}} in Scotland, Northern Ireland, Cumbria, Wales and the Channel Islands, and coincide largely with upland areas. Groundwater flow and storage is mostly shallow and flow paths are short, {{although there is}} some limited deeper groundwater circulation. Groundwater quality is variable but often weakly mineralized, reflecting incomplete water-rock reaction. There are many small groundwater sources used for private supply and a number also for public supply; these offer an important social and economic asset to isolated rural and island communities. Groundwater occurs in four rock types: fractured rock, fractured rock with regolith, massive rock and karstic limestone. Identification of specific groundwater settings within these rock types provides an insight into the prevailing groundwater flow paths. This enables source protection zones to be prescribed according to the hydrogeological setting rather than by detailed data collection and modelling. This method of prescription is <b>applicable</b> <b>universally</b> to basement aquifers and {{is not limited to}} those in the UK. ...|$|R
2500|$|To {{understand}} {{the role of the}} medical director in what North Americans call EMS, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of precisely how EMS systems (or ambulance service, SAMU, SMURD, etc.) operate in various locales. [...] There is little about what we call EMS that is <b>universally</b> <b>applicable.</b> [...] Instead, communities and medical practitioners tend to develop systemic arrangements that are based on an assessment of local need. In the delivery of what we commonly refer to as EMS in various countries, there are two major service delivery models, with a number of minor models or variations from the main models. [...] The first model, and arguably the oldest, is generally described as the Franco-German model. This model is physician-led, and places those operating ambulances into what are in many cases, minor, supporting roles. While this model is generally referred to as Franco-German, this may be something of a misnomer, since there is ample evidence and documentation indicating that {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, many North American hospital-based ambulances in larger centres were actually staffed by ambulance surgeons; physicians who actually responded in the ambulance and provided care in a manner which very much resembles the current Franco-German model.

40|$|This {{article is}} a {{contribution}} to the under-researched but growing literature relating organ-isational theory to non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Many developmental academics and practitioners have highlighted the imposition of Northern ideas and values on Southern NGOs as inherently colonial, patronising and leading to minimal grassroots autonomy (Crush 1995; Escobar 1995; Ferguson 2003 [1990]; Hobart 1993). While acknowledging this, the present article analyses the diffusion of Northern managerialism on Southern ways of working with special reference to how Southern NGOs are pressured to exude a cohesive, uniform and positive organisational identity in order to work in part-nership with their donors. In doing so, the analysis points to the concept of organisational identity itself being a construct of Northern ideas of management and, therefore, not <b>applicable</b> <b>universally.</b> It is suggested that fissures and resistances created by this double construction are played out in development project reports. It is in reports that an organ-isational narrative is created and an image is portrayed of the organisation: setting up a textual space where organisational identity is legitimated and used for negotiating autonomy in relation to donors...|$|R
50|$|One {{tenet of}} {{analytic}} feminism holds that if philosophers positions are <b>applicable</b> <b>universally,</b> {{they must be}} usable {{by men and women}} alike, and from a range of social situations. This is a basis for what can be considered the reconstruction of philosophy via analytic feminism. This approach, which somewhat mirrors the construction of feminist philosophy tradition, attempts to limit the creation of areas or categories of philosophy that apply to only some women and feminists. It's an attempt to apply to 'all' (men and women) instead of 'some' (women and/or feminists) with specific examples of topics being feminine ethics, gynocentric ethics, or lesbian ethics. The basis for this universal approach would be an analytic feminist ethics and metaphysics which would create and establish a new criterion of adequacy for the fields of ethics and metaphysics. The goal of Miranda Fricker and Jennifer Hornsby, editors of The Cambridge Companion to Feminism in Philosophy, is to have this position included in the mainstream of the discipline (Fricker and Hornsby 2000).|$|R
