5|$|On March 6, 2014, the FCC {{announced}} that it would hold a vote on March 31 on a proposal to ban joint sales agreements involving television stations outright, making them attributable to FCC ownership limits if the senior partner sells 15% or more of advertising time of a competing junior partner station in the JSA; the ban applies to both existing sharing agreements <b>under</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> structure as well as pending station transactions that include a JSA. Station owners would be given a two-year grace period to unwind or modify joint sales agreements in violation of the policy; coordinated retransmission consent negotiations between two of the four highest-rated stations in a single market would also be barred under the proposal. Wheeler also proposed an expedited process to review joint sales agreements on a case-by-case basis, granting a waiver of the rules if a broadcaster can prove a particular joint sales agreement arrangement serves the public interest.|$|E

5|$|To {{encourage}} individual {{workers to}} work hard and produce as much as they possibly could, most workers in Soviet industry were paid on a piece-rate; their wage payments depended upon how much work they personally completed. Soviet workers were given individual quotas for the amount of work they should personally deliver and would earn a basic wage (stavka) by fulfilling 100 percent of their quota. The wage rate for work would grow as production over this level increased. If a worker produced 120 percent of his own personal quota for the month (for example, if he was supposed to produce 1,000 items, but actually produced 1,200) he would receive his basic wage for the first 100 percent, a higher rate for the first 10 percent of over production and an even higher rate for the next 10 percent. Soviet authorities hoped that this would encourage a Stakhanovite spirit of overfulfillment of quotas among the Soviet workforce. In 1956, approximately 75 percent of Soviet workers were paid <b>under</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> piece-rate system, so the majority of Soviet workers could significantly boost their earnings by increasing their output.|$|E
5|$|Sherman paid greater {{attention}} to foreign affairs {{during the second half}} of his Senate career, serving as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations. In 1868, the Senate had ratified the Burlingame Treaty with China, allowing unrestricted immigration from China. After the Panic of 1873, Chinese immigrants were blamed for depressing wages; in reaction, Congress in 1879 passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, but Hayes vetoed it. Now, three years later, after China had agreed to treaty revisions, Congress tried again to exclude Chinese immigrants: Senator John F. Miller of California introduced another Exclusion Act that denied Chinese immigrants United States citizenship and banned their immigration for a twenty-year period. Sherman opposed both the 1880 treaty revisions and the bill Miller proposed, believing that the Exclusion Act reversed the United States' traditional welcoming of all people and the country's dependence on foreign immigration for growth. President Arthur vetoed the bill, and Sherman voted to sustain the veto. A new Exclusion Act passed to conform to Arthur's objections. Sherman voted against this bill, too, but it passed, and Arthur signed it into law. In 1885, Sherman voted in favor of the Alien Contract Labor Law, which barred engaging in a labor contract before immigrating or transporting a person <b>under</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> contract to the United States. Sherman saw this Act as a more appropriate solution to depressed wages than Chinese exclusion: the problem, as he saw it, was not the national origin of Chinese immigrants, but their employment under serf-like conditions.|$|E

25|$|As noted above, a local {{government}} may only {{enter into a}} contract that is within the scope of its charter.

The private party who performs <b>under</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> contract will have no means of recovery, even under equitable theories such as equitable estoppel, implied contract, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment. This limitation also applies where the subject of the contract is permissible under the charter, but {{the manner in which the}} contract is made or awarded violates proscriptions set forth in the charter. For example, if the charter requires that contracts for provision of a public service be awarded to the lowest bidder in an open bidding process, and such a process is not used to award the contract, then the contract itself is void and the private party to the contract will have no recourse to enforce the local government's obligations thereunder.|$|E

25|$|The {{collectivization}} {{of agriculture}} was essentially completed {{with the establishment}} of the people's communes in 1958. Communes were large, embracing scores of villages. They were intended to be multipurpose organizations, combining economic and local administrative functions. Under the commune system the household remained the basic unit of consumption, and some differences in standards of living remained, although they were not as marked as they had been before land reform. <b>Under</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> system, however, upward mobility required becoming a team or commune cadre or obtaining a scarce technical position such as a being a truck driver.|$|E
25|$|In {{mathematical}} logic, {{very often}} symbols {{are not allowed}} to be nullary, so that constant symbols must be treated separately rather than as nullary function symbols. They form a set Sconst disjoint from Sfunc, on which the arity function ar is not defined. However, this only serves to complicate matters, especially in proofs by induction over the structure of a formula, where an additional case must be considered. Any nullary relation symbol, which is also not allowed <b>under</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> definition, can be emulated by a unary relation symbol together with a sentence expressing that its value is the same for all elements. This translation fails only for empty structures (which are often excluded by convention). If nullary symbols are allowed, then every formula of propositional logic is also a formula of first-order logic.|$|E

25|$|A {{major concern}} cited by Greek {{officials}} was {{a number of}} maps that have circulated by nationalist groups based in Skopje depicting parts of Greece (including Thessaloniki, Greece's second largest city) as {{being part of a}} future United Macedonia, and the country's prime minister photographed laying a wreath <b>under</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> map just {{a few weeks before the}} summit. Also a poster displayed in Skopje just days before the Bucharest summit by an artist replacing the white cross on the Greek flag with the swastika, as a way of comparing modern Greece to Nazi Germany and caricatures of Greek PM Karamanlis depicted wearing a Nazi SS uniform led to vigorous Greek diplomatic protests and international condemnation although the government disassociated itself from the depictions and expressed it has no connection and no authority over artists' works.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} microcontinents, or {{continental}} fragments, that are built of continental crust {{but do not}} contain a craton. Some of these are fragments of Gondwana or other ancient cratonic continents: Zealandia, which includes New Zealand and New Caledonia; Madagascar; the northern Mascarene Plateau, which includes the Seychelles. Other islands, such as several in the Caribbean Sea, are composed largely of granitic rock as well, but all continents contain both granitic and basaltic crust, {{and there is no}} clear boundary as to which islands would be considered microcontinents <b>under</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> definition. The Kerguelen Plateau, for example, is largely volcanic, but is associated with the breakup of Gondwanaland and is considered a microcontinent, whereas volcanic Iceland and Hawaii are not. The British Isles, Sri Lanka, Borneo, and Newfoundland are margins of the Laurasian continent—only separated by inland seas flooding its margins.|$|E
25|$|The College Tribune {{was founded}} in 1989, with the {{assistance}} of noted political commentator Vincent Browne. Then an evening student at the university, Browne noted the lack of an independent media outlet for students and staff and set about rectifying this with the establishment of a student newspaper. The paper was initially established with links to The Sunday Tribune, though over time these links faded and ultimately, the Tribune would long outlast its national counterpart. The paper has since its inception supported itself financially through commercial advertising in its print edition. Operating <b>under</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> model allows the paper and its staff to maintain genuine editorial independence from both university authorities and the Students' Union. The Tribune has been recognised {{on a number of occasions}} at the national student media awards, particularly in sports writing, of which the paper maintains a strong tradition. In addition to winning Student Newspaper of the Year at the 1996 USI & Irish Independent Media Awards, then editor Conor Lally was also awarded Student Journalist of the Year. 2003 saw Tribune stalwart Peter Lahiff win Diversity Writer of the Year at the Guardian Student Media Awards, to-date the only Irish based recipient of a Guardian award.|$|E

25|$|The case of R. v. Sussex Justices, {{ex parte}} McCarthy (1923) {{provides}} {{an illustration of}} the differences. In that case, the person who acted as clerk to certain magistrates {{was a member of}} a law firm that represented a party with an interest in the outcome of a matter being decided by the magistrates. When the magistrates withdrew to consider the matter, the clerk went with them in case they needed advice on any legal issues. However, the magistrates reached a decision without consulting the clerk. Thus, on the facts of the case, there was no possibility of actual bias whatsoever. Yet the decision in question was set aside because justice had to be seen to be done. Judicial Commissioner Menon highlighted that the underlying principle protected the appearance of justice being done, and reasoned that it would not be relevant <b>under</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> principle to consider whether justice was actually done. Nor did he think that Gough could be reconciled with ex parte McCarthy, despite the attempt in Gough attempt to confine the latter case to its own facts. In his view, the two tests were therefore different in substance, in addition to the different perspective that each test adopted. Furthermore, those differences were sometimes material in deciding a case; for example, the choice of the real likelihood test was a deciding factor of the result in Gough.|$|E
500|$|A {{commonly}} applied narrower {{definition is}} that a tree has a woody trunk formed by secondary growth, meaning that the trunk thickens each year by growing outwards, {{in addition to the}} primary upwards growth from the growing tip. <b>Under</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> definition, herbaceous plants such as palms, bananas and papayas are not considered trees regardless of their height, growth form or stem girth.
