50|$|In {{addition}} to its important role for passengers, the station is also significant for freight: containers are transhipped from rail to road on the sidings. A new <b>unloading</b> <b>yard</b> in the multi-modal terminal is expected from 2012/2013 to relieve the Oberhausen container terminal, {{which is at the}} centre of the Augsburg-Gersthofen-Neusäß triangle.|$|E
50|$|The {{line from}} the Carl Helbig chair and {{furniture}} factory connected in the station area; this supposedly existed from {{the construction of the}} line. The company was absorbed into the East German government company of VEB Vereinigte Sitzmöbelindustrie Neuhausen. The subscriber contract was terminated on 31 December 1993 and the tracks were demolished in 1994. More important was the connecting line for the construction site of the Rauschenbach Dam, which existed between 1961 and 1965. To this end, main track 1 had been extended over the Flöha, where a two-track <b>unloading</b> <b>yard</b> was built for building materials.|$|E
50|$|On {{the east}} side of the railway {{property}} is the former goods yard. A sales outlet and a workshop are now located there. On the west side there is a rail freight <b>unloading</b> <b>yard</b> and the Bavarian part of the station, which is mainly used as a train depot for the Unterfranken-Shuttle, Erfurter Bahn and Deutsche Bahn Regional-Expresses. For the ease of operations there are three signal boxes, a fourth has been closed. Opposite the entrance building is the Meiningen depot. It is used for the permanent establishment of the Süd-Thüringen-Bahn. Furthermore, a Federal Police station is established in the Bavarian station, which was in a very poor condition in 2009. From January 2010, the DB reconstructed the platforms and shelters, but not the entrance building.|$|E
50|$|All of {{the wood}} is {{received}} in 8-foot lengths from the forests of Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan. 60% is received by rail and 40% is received by truck. Wood is <b>unloaded</b> to the <b>yard</b> which has a storage capacity of 5,000 cords.|$|R
50|$|Transportable steel yards are now {{often carried}} on a truck to an area where stock-work can be {{completed}} without having to drive stock long distances to permanent yards. Stockmen and their horses can be <b>unloaded</b> at these <b>yards</b> and then the cattle can be branded and also transported from these yards if required. Lambs are also often marked in temporary yards {{as a means of}} reducing infection.|$|R
60|$|Dan {{had gone}} in for {{building}} model boats; but after he had filled the schoolroom with chips, which he expected Una to clear away, they turned him out of doors and he took all his tools {{up the hill to}} Mr Springett's yard, where he knew he could make as much mess as he chose. Old Mr Springett was a builder, contractor, and sanitary engineer, and his yard, which opened off the village street, was always full of interesting things. At one end of it was a long loft, reached by a ladder, where he kept his iron-bound scaffold-planks, tins of paints, pulleys, and odds and ends he had found in old houses. He would sit here by the hour watching his carts as they loaded or <b>unloaded</b> in the <b>yard</b> below, while Dan gouged and grunted at the carpenter's bench near the loft window. Mr Springett and Dan had always been particular friends, for Mr Springett was so old he could remember when railways were being made in the southern counties of England, and people were allowed to drive dogs in carts.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{enhancing}} the performance utilization of locos by uncovering the non-value adding activities in raw material <b>unloading</b> <b>yard</b> (RMUY) {{of an integrated}} steel plant. JSW Steel Ltd, Vijayanagar works is the India’s first 10 MTPA steel plant at single location, “the fastest growing steel plant in India”. The capacity expansion of steel industry involves expansion of the production capacity {{at different stages of}} steel making like Raw material handling system, Treatment plants, Iron making, Steel making, Casting, & Rolling mills. At present Cold Rolling Mill- 2 and Steel Making Shop- 3 are going to be commissioned shortly. Hence with the expansion of the steel plant, the demand for raw materi-als will increase which will increase the number of inbound rakes arriving at RMUY. The increase in number of rakes arriving at RMUY causes congestion at the tracks causing bottlenecks for the unloading facilities and limits the rake movements within RMUY. The external railway agency providing the rail service, charges for demurrage (delay in return of rakes beyond 8 hr of free unloading time). Thus such bottlenecks not only adversely affect the unloading capabilities of the yard, but also increase the demurrage costs. Using Work Measurement Technique, 24 hr Time study has been conducted in raw material <b>unloading</b> <b>yard</b> of JSW Steel Ltd, to estimate the existing utilization of nine locos simultaneously three shifts per day. Process chart is drawn to identify the separate steps or events that occur during a series of actionscarried out by loco in RMUY and activity chart is draw...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Bulk {{material}} handling plays {{a vital role}} in the effective operation of process industries. In Visakhapatnam steel plant is one such shore based process industry operating at 120 % of rated capacity of 3. 0 MT/annum. Liquid steel {{is in the process of}} expanding its capacity to 6. 3 million ton per annum, around 24 MT/annum of bulk materials are to be handled in Visakhapatnam steel plant(VSP). VSP is equipped with peripheral <b>unloading</b> <b>yard</b> for the first time in India to unload the bulk materials in plant premises by transporting by locos, to plant wagon pushers of railways. Raw material plant in VSP is having unloading facilities like rotary wagon tripper, storage yard with machines for stacking and reclaiming and distribution belt conveyor system to feed various raw materials to different process plants by proportioning and by sizing. Thus stackers play a critical role in meeting the demand of bulk material. This project deals with the strengthen of MAST HEAD of twin boom stacker by redesigning to avoid frequent failures. The twin boom stacker is used to stack the raw material in two parallel yards depending on the requirement. The reliability of the twin boom stacker is utmost important for stacking the materials in the storage yard for better logistics. The ageing of twin boom stacker with the prolonged operation resulted in uneven loads or jerks on MAST HEAD. This has resulted in frequent failures of MAST HEAD. The design modification has been verified by modeling the MAST HEAD using SOLIDWORKS Version 2012 and analyzed using FEM package ANSYS 14. 5. The Necessary stress strengthening has been made based on the preliminary analysis by increasing the thickness of the spacer and observed that the stresses are within the tolerable limits and are discussed in the topic RESULTS...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, James Beatty, who {{had played}} an {{important}} part in working with Peto's partnership to build the European and North American Railway, was recruited as chief engineer. The line was surveyed by Donald Campbell, who had also worked on the European and North American Railway. Campbell's first task was to create a wharf at Balaclava where the railway materials could be <b>unloaded,</b> with a <b>yard</b> adjacent. He planned for the track to pass along the middle of the main street of the town. It then went through a gorge at the north of the town close to the water's edge and over swampy ground to the village of Kadikoi. From here, the railway had to rise some [...] {{to the top of the}} plateau. Of the routes available, Campbell chose to follow the existing road. Although at parts its gradient was as steep as 1 in 7, Campbell managed find a route with a maximum gradient of 1 in 14. [...] A stationary engine would be required at the top of this stretch to pull the railway carriages up the incline. Once on the plateau, the ground was rough but fairly level and here it presented fewer problems. Lord Raglan's headquarters were at the top of the col, and it was decided that a depot should be constructed here.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{industrial}} construction, each fabricated material item {{such as a}} steel piece or a {{pipe spool}} is a unique building element. They are typically staged in a large laydown yard before final on-site installation. Manually tracking and locating each particular item in a large laydown yard can be very time consuming, and excessive man hours spent in this process can negatively impact on field installation activity and overall project performance. This study developed a robust and accurate yet cost effective material tracking and locating solution based on mature tracking technologies. The proposed solution features a handheld computer equipped with barcoding and GPS technologies for laydown yard material tracking and fast retrieval in a cost effective manner. The device scans item barcodes when the item is <b>unloaded</b> in the <b>yard</b> and, meanwhile, captures the GPS coordinates along with the item image, and stores these data in a central database. For material retrieval, material lookup through the database provides geographical location and images of an item, and navigation function gets the crew to the item in a shorter duration. To validate the accuracy of GPS and practicality of this solution, various handheld computing devices with built-in GPS functions were tested by comparing their GPS recordings against the true coordinates of selected geological survey benchmarks. The accuracy {{is measured by the}} distance between the true coordinates to the device-recorded coordinates using Vincenty's formula. A prototype system consisting of a mobile device and a software module was developed, and the achieved GPS accuracy is within 3 meters. While the proposed solution has the potential to significantly improve material tracking efficiency, its low initial and operating costs and robust performance make it practical to use {{in a wide range of}} projects...|$|R
30|$|As alliances {{have grown}} and changed {{there is much}} concern over the effects they may have on {{competitive}} policies for the shipping public and the buying power that large container lines and alliances have over ports, cargo terminals and other services (Merk, 2016). Alliances have come under severe criticism from shippers for poor quality of service, disruptions to supply chains through the bunching of vessels, voided sailings, and other delays (Global Shippers Forum, 2015) though no research studies to date substantiate this claim. One option to alleviate pressure on ports is supply chain integration (SCI) beyond the quay, using complementary services (Franc and Van der Horst, 2010). Supply chain integration {{can be defined as}} “a process of redefining and connecting entities through coordinating or sharing information and resources”. It creates linkages between partners who have different interests in the same supply chains, and/or who have similar interests but participate in multiple supply chains. For example, a terminal operator could share information about schedules with other terminal operators, carriers, shippers or port authority to better schedule the movement of containers {{in and out of the}} ports. Efforts at enhancing SCI between ocean carriers and their stakeholders have been researched by Lam and Voorde (2011); Tseng and Liao, (2015) among others. Some progress has been made using information such as load profiles at seaports to assist terminal operators in devising <b>unloading</b> schedules and <b>yard</b> management. Efforts to look for cooperative complementary integration further downstream in the supply chain are rare, though they do occur (Song and Panayides, 2002; Van der Horst and Van der Lugt, 2014). Tighter integration with prominent supply chains could provide a source of value added for ocean carriers if they are seen as the prime movers of the efforts. Coordinated efforts to improve integration downstream toward the destination by ocean shippers, mediated by standardization, will result in better differentiation for individual carriers regarding logistics costs, better performance and service, and more business on specific routes for alliances (Bagby, 2015; Notteboom and Rodrigue, 2005).|$|R
30|$|A {{total of}} 79 railway {{stations}} and areas in Switzerland {{and in the}} Principality of Liechtenstein were visited in 2011 and 2012 (Figure 1). The feral presence of oilseed rape was detected in 58 sites (73 %) {{and a total of}} 2403 individuals were tested for genetic modification (including negative control, Table 1). The presence of weedy oilseed rape in most of the locations is not surprising as oilseed rape has been transported for many years and populations are well established in many Swiss railway areas. In 21 stations (Airolo, Balerna, Bern, Bulle, Chiasso, Chur, Eaux-Vives, Glarus, Ins, Locarno, Lyss, Magadino - Vira, Melide, Mendrisio, Murten, Näfels, Rapperswil, Schaan, St. Gallen, Wattwil, Zug) we were unable to find any oilseed rape plants (Figure 1). The CP 4 EPSPS enzyme was immunologically detected in 50 wild growing oilseed rape plants (2.1 % of total) distributed over 4 populations (Table 1). At the railway station of Lugano (Canton Ticino) 91.3 % of the plants were tested positive, at the <b>unloading</b> railway <b>yard</b> in the port of Kleinhüningen (Canton Basel Stadt) 88.9 %, at the railway station of St. Johann (Canton Basel Stadt) 92.3 % and at the railway yard in the port Muttenz-Auhafen (Canton Basel Landschaft) 2.1 %. All other tested sites were free from GE-oilseed rape. The detection of CP 4 EPSPS {{and the fact that the}} GE- plants survived GLY treatment in Lugano (which took place in early September 2011) and in Kleinhüningen (in Mai 2012) suggest that the plants were expressing the transgenes at efficient levels. Although herbicides are regularly applied to all railway infrastructures in Switzerland to keep them functional, we did not directly observe treatments in St. Jakob and Muttenz. Only a subset of Swiss railway stations was sampled; nevertheless GEHT plants were found in four locations. This indicates that introduction events of GE-oilseed rape are still a rather rare event in the country and seem to happen predominantly in its important entry points of imported goods, like the Basel area. Transgenic oilseed rape is only recently become available and is transported in much smaller quantities than the conventional crop, and consequently has a lower incidence in railway ruderal habitats. However, it is conceivable that it is just a matter of time for transgenic populations to become more abundant considering the positive selective pressure, with consequent increased difficulties to keep the infrastructure free of weeds. A systematic long-term monitoring is therefore strongly recommended. The GE-populations did not establish through introductions of pure GMHT seeds as illustrated by the population in Muttenz, where only a low percentage of the plants was transgenic. Moreover, had all founder seeds been transgenic in populations with a high frequency of GE-plants (i.e. Lugano, Kleinhüningen and St. Johann), the presence of individuals not containing cp 4 epsps genes would hardly be possible, as commercialised GE-oilseed rape contains the transgenes in a homozygous state, ruling out the possibility of genetic drift. More likely, the GE- populations established through introduction of few or even a single seed containing transgenes, followed by multiple cycles of reproduction.|$|R
