5|$|About 45–50 {{days after}} hatching, the chicks form a crèche, huddling {{together}} for warmth and protection. During this time, both parents forage at sea and return periodically {{to feed their}} chicks. A crèche may comprise <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>several</b> thousand birds densely packed together and is essential for surviving the low Antarctic temperatures.|$|E

5|$|A {{loud and}} active bird, the red wattlebird {{is found in}} pairs, in a small family group, or alone during the {{breeding}} season, and gathers in larger groups of <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>several</b> hundred birds over winter. It flies straight or with a slightly undulating pattern, alternating between gliding and flapping its wings with quick shallow beats, at or slightly above {{the level of the}} tree canopy. The red wattlebird moves on the ground by hopping, cocking its tail upwards slightly.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a tidal shock, streams of stars can be pulled away from the cluster halo, leaving only the core part of the cluster. These tidal {{interaction}} effects create tails of stars that can extend <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>several</b> degrees of arc away from the cluster. These tails typically both precede and follow the cluster along its orbit. The tails can accumulate significant portions of the original mass of the cluster, and can form clumplike features.|$|E
5|$|Dust {{particles}} tend {{to stick}} {{to each other in}} the dense disk environment, leading to the formation of larger particles <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>several</b> centimeters in size. The signatures of the dust processing and coagulation are observed in the infrared spectra of the young disks. Further aggregation can lead to the formation of planetesimals measuring 1km across or larger, which are the building blocks of planets. Planetesimal formation is another unsolved problem of disk physics, as simple sticking becomes ineffective as dust particles grow larger.|$|E

5|$|Male {{care for}} infants has been {{documented}} in ruffed lemur societies. During early development, adult males may guard the nests of multiple core group females, as well as help care for the infants that were likely fathered by other males. During the season when females practice infant stashing, males effectively lighten the reproductive burden of <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>several</b> mothers by guarding, huddling, grooming, travelling, playing with and feeding the young.|$|E
5|$|Males {{make two}} calls that are {{directed}} at females, sometimes {{as a prelude}} to mating. One is a sequence of short squeaks; the other is made up of consecutive ah notes with 0.1 second between each note. These calls can be brief or last <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>several</b> minutes. Nestlings make a noisy grating begging call when seeking or expecting food. An adult female may also make the call while incubating the eggs. Immature birds also make a grating call not associated with begging that parents ignore.|$|E
5|$|Only {{insects that}} live in nests or colonies {{demonstrate}} any true capacity for fine-scale spatial orientation or homing. This can allow an insect to return unerringly to a single hole a few millimeters in diameter among thousands of apparently identical holes clustered together, after a trip of <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>several</b> kilometers' distance. In a phenomenon known as philopatry, insects that hibernate have shown the ability to recall a specific location {{up to a year}} after last viewing the area of interest. A few insects seasonally migrate large distances between different geographic regions (e.g., the overwintering areas of the monarch butterfly).|$|E

5|$|The pied butcherbird {{is thought}} to be monogamous, though its {{breeding}} habits have not been much studied. There is evidence of cooperative breeding, with some mated pairs being assisted by <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>several</b> other helper birds. These individuals help feed young and defend the nest. These pairs or small groups defend their territory from intruders, mobbing and chasing raptors and other birds, and occasionally dogs or people. They may attack animals (and people) that venture too close to the nest, with one bird coming front-on while the other may approach from behind.|$|E
5|$|The storm's {{flooding}} causes major {{damage to}} the lower floors of all structures near the shoreline, and many coastal structures can be completely flattened or washed away by the storm surge. Virtually all trees are uprooted or snapped and some may be debarked, isolating most affected communities. Massive evacuation of residential areas may be required if the hurricane threatens populated areas. Total and extremely long-lived power outages and water losses are to be expected, possibly for <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>several</b> months.|$|E
5|$|Blacktip reef sharks have {{extremely}} small home ranges and exhibit strong site fidelity, remaining {{within the same}} local area for <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>several</b> years at a time. They are active predators of small bony fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans, and have also been known to feed on sea snakes and seabirds. Accounts of the blacktip reef shark's life history have been variable and sometimes contradictory, in part reflecting geographical differences within the species. Like other members of its family, this shark is viviparous, with females giving birth to two to five young on a biennial, annual, or possibly biannual cycle. Reports of the gestation period range from 7–9, through 10–11, to possibly 16 months. Mating is preceded by the male following closely behind the female, likely attracted by her chemical signals. Newborn sharks are found further inshore and in shallower water than adults, frequently roaming in large groups over areas flooded by high tide.|$|E
