Indeed, the individual self and collective self are fundamental components of the self-concept, with each being important and meaningful to human experience. However, are those selves equally important and meaningful? We review a program of research empirically testing three competing hypotheses that suggests that the motivational core of human experience is (a) the individual self, (b) the collective self, or (c) determined by contextual factors that make a given self momentarily accessible.

30|$|Our {{paper is}} {{embedded}} into the empirical literature on voluntary disclosure in financial accounting {{and its impact}} on investor decision-making (e.g., Botosan 1997; Hail 2002; Leuz and Verrecchia 2000; Healy and Palepu 2001; Botosan 2006; Daske 2006; Gu and Li 2007; Leuz and Wysocki 2008 or Glaum et al. 2011). Whereas this literature provides broad, though not <b>unanimous</b> <b>evidence</b> that an increase in credible voluntary disclosure is associated with a decreasing cost of equity capital and other, related measures, there is still a research gap regarding the impact of voluntary disclosures on strategy. This is not obvious per se due to the qualitative, prospective and subjective nature of strategy information.|$|E
60|$|But {{the obvious}} reply to this {{hypothesis}} is, that Letter IV, {{by the evidence}} of modern experts (<b>evidence</b> <b>unanimous</b> and irresistible), is just as much forged as all the rest, is just as certainly in Sprot’s imitation of Logan’s handwriting. This being so, why did Sprot keep it back so long, and why, having kept it back, did he, almost in his last hour, produce it, and say (if he did) that it was genuine, and his model, as it certainly was? This is the last enigma of Sprot. His motives defy my poor efforts to decipher them. Even if the substance of IV is genuine, what were Sprot’s motives? I do not feel assured that Sprot really maintained the genuineness of the handwriting of Letter IV. His remark that he kept Logan’s letter only till he forged others on it, as a model, certainly implies {{that he did not}} keep it after he had done his forgeries, and therefore that our Letter IV is, confessedly, not Logan’s original. Certainly it is not.|$|R
5000|$|Detecting {{phosphorus}} deficiency {{can take}} multiple forms. A preliminary detection method is a visual inspection of plants. Darker green leaves and purplish or red pigment can indicate a deficiency in phosphorus. This method however {{can be an}} unclear diagnosis because other plant environment factors can result in similar discoloration symptoms. In commercial or well monitored settings for plants, phosphorus deficiency is diagnosed by scientific testing. Additionally, discoloration in plant leaves only occurs under fairly severe phosphorus deficiency so it is beneficial to planters and farmers to scientifically check phosphorus levels before discoloration occurs. The most prominent method of checking phosphorus levels is by soil testing. The major soil testing methods are Bray 1-P, Mehlich 3, and Olsen methods. Each of these methods are viable but each method has tendencies to be more accurate in known geographical areas. These tests use chemical solutions to extract phosphorus from the soil. The extract must then be analyzed to determine the concentration of the phosphorus. Colorimetry is used to determine this concentration. With {{the addition of the}} phosphorus extract into a colorimeter, there is visual color change of the solution and the degree to this color change is an indicator of phosphorus concentration. To apply this testing method on phosphorus deficiency, the measured phosphorus concentration must be compared to known values. Most plants have established and thoroughly tested optimal soil conditions. If the concentration of phosphorus measured from the colorimeter test is significantly lower than the plant’s optimal soil levels, then it is likely the plant is phosphorus deficient. The soil testing with colorimetric analysis, while widely used, can be subject to diagnostic problems as a result of interference from other present compounds and elements. Additional phosphorus detection methods such as spectral radiance and inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP) are also implemented with the goal of improving reading accuracy. According to the World Congress of Soil Scientists, the advantages of these light-based measurement methods are their quickness of evaluation, simultaneous measurements of plant nutrients, and their non-destructive testing nature. Although these methods have experimental based <b>evidence,</b> <b>unanimous</b> approval of the methods has not yet been achieved.|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{research}} {{studies have shown}} that aging is a continuous and cumulative process of biological changes which frequently result in cardiovascular diseases in the older age group. Degenerative diseases of old age such as atherosclerosis and coronary artery diseases appear to be related to abnormal lipid metabolism. The findings which indicate serum cholesterol values rise with age are by no means <b>unanimous.</b> The combined <b>evidence</b> in the literature points out that serum cholesterol of newborn infants is low, then rises steadily with age in both sexes from adolescence through middle age with a higher value in males than in females. The serum cholesterol level reaches the maximum in the sixth decade of life and then drops for men while for women it rises. Also, the changes in serum phospholipid and total lipid levels with age were similar to the changes in serum cholesterol levels in both sexes. Several factors such as age, sex, metabolism, heredity, environment, and endocrine functions have been found to alter serum lipid levels. These factors appear to be associated to a complex pattern; the precise proportions of which have not as yet been clearly defined. The environmental factor {{plays an important role in}} altering the serum lipid valued and various aspects of this factor can easily be studied and modified by workers. One of the components of the environmental factor, dietary fat has been studied extensively, yet, the exact relation which it has to the development of atherosclerosis has not been settled. The amount and kind of fat and the nature of constituent fatty acids in the diet are considered to be the influential factors directly affecting serum lipid levels. Most of the workers have indicated that the unsaturation of the fatty acids or the ratio between polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids might best explain the serum cholesterol-regulating activity of the various fats. Many investigators have demonstrated that the substitution of certain vegetable oils for certain animal fats in human diets leads to a decrease of serum cholesterol and phospholipid values. Of the vegetable oils which were studied, corn oil, due to its high content of plant sterols and unsaturated fatty acids, has the most effective hypocholesterolemic activity. However, this is no proof that the lowering of serum cholesterol levels decreases coronary heart diseases, but there is circumstantial evidence that lowering is desirable. Serum lipid is present as many fractions, namely, free cholesterol, cholesterol esters, triglycerides or neutral fat, free fatty acids and phospholipids. More than one-third of the total lipids usually are cholesterol esters, about one-third phopholipids, one-fifth triglycerides, and about one-tenth is free cholesterol. Although the absolute concentration of lipid values varies, the ratio between the free and esterified cholesterol is constant and is approximately 1 : 3. Considerable variation in the concentration of serum lipids is found among different individuals, but the lipid in serum appears to be maintained within a range which is characteristic for each individual and from which large deviations do not ordinarily occur in the absence of disease or therapeutic treatment. There are relatively few studies of the blood lipid levels of older people. Hence, there is limited information on the kind and amount of different lipids in the serum of normal, senior citizens who are 65 to 90 years of age and less information on studies of the effect of diet on their blood levels. Further work with the older age people is desirable. The objectives of this study were to determine the normal levels of serum cholesterol, total lipids, and phospholipids of older people on the usual diet and to determine the effect of the substitution of corn oil for all other fats used in cooking on these serum lipids. The research was based on a group of forty older, institutionalized subjects, men and women, ranging from 62 to 95 years of age, in the Sunshine Terrace home. Studies were made on serum lipids while the subjects were on the usual house diet and after corn oil was used as the only source of cooking fat in the same kind of diet. Venous blood samples were taken in each period for serum cholesterol, total lipid and phospholipid determinations. Dietary records were also collected for dietary calculation...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to survey the {{academic}} literature concerning the separation of commercial and investment banking, and {{to serve as a}} basis for future research. We provide a review of 75 papers showing that there is no <b>unanimous</b> <b>evidence</b> either for or against the argument that a separation of commercial and investment banking would be more beneficial for society overall. We further demonstrate that the recent financial crisis did not directly stem from the combination of commercial and investment banking activities within universal banks. The findings do, however, provide evidence showing that increased diversification within the financial industry has amplified the systematic risk exposure for banks and increased the similarity between institutions. Our results suggest that regulators should focus on limiting the interconnectedness and similarity between financial institutions, thereby minimizing the risk of systemic crises and market contagion. Even though this literature review does not determine whether or not commercial and investment banking activities should be unified, we hope that it can act as an aid to future research in the area...|$|E
30|$|Sweden {{has been}} a sort of pioneer {{in the use of}} active labor market programs; hence it may be of {{particular}} interest to examine the experiences generated from that country. Evaluation studies based on data from the late 1980 ’s and the 1990 ’s – summarized by, e.g., Calmfors et al. (2001) – tended to convey a rather dismaying message; ALMP apparently did little to help unemployed job seekers back to work. Later studies have, however, provided a more encouraging picture; see Forslund and Vikström (2011). Possible explanations for this shift are, inter alia, that the overall “activity stance” (the fraction of job seekers that are activated) has been scaled a bit down, making it possible to substitute quality for quantity, and that an improved economic situation has ensured the existence of a demand for labor that the programs can aim at satisfying. Denmark has now taken over the role as the country with the strongest emphasis on activation in its UI system. But, while there is quite <b>unanimous</b> <b>evidence</b> in support of a “threat effect” of the activation strategy in Denmark, the evidence on the impacts of actual participation are mixed. Evaluation of private sector employment programs tend to come out with favorable effects, whereas training programs and public sector employment programs mainly have no effects; see, e.g., Kluve et al. (2007, Chapter 6).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{empirical evidence}} on the economic consequences of mandatory adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in the European Union (EU) and provides suggestions on how future research can {{add to our understanding}} of these effects. Based on the explicitly stated objectives of the EU‟s so-called „IAS Regulation‟, we distinguish between intended and unintended consequences of mandatory IFRS adoption. Empirical research on the intended consequences generally fails to document an increase in the comparability or transparency of financial statements. In contrast, there is rich and almost <b>unanimous</b> <b>evidence</b> of positive effects on capital markets and at the macroeconomic level. We argue that certain research design issues are likely to contribute to this apparent mismatch in findings and we suggest areas for future research to address it. The literature investigating unintended consequences of mandatory IFRS adoption is still in its infancy. However, extant empirical evidence and insights from non-IFRS settings suggest that mandatory IFRS adoption has the potential to materially affect contractual outcomes. We conclude that both the intended and the unintended consequences deserve further scrutiny to assess {{the costs and benefits of}} mandatory IFRS adoption, which may help provide a basis for evaluating the effectiveness of the IAS Regulation. We provide specific guidance for future research in this field. International accounting, IFRS adoption, economic consequences, contracting, regulation, review...|$|E
40|$|Esophageal {{cancer is}} among the ten most {{frequent}} cancers in the world. Once diagnosis is established prognosis is poor with five-year survival rates below 10 %. Over the last few years, the evidence- base for treatment of oesophageal cancer has changed {{with the publication of}} several important articles in this field. This article reviews these and other relevant publica-tions with focus on current evidence which holds potential for an improvement in survival in oesophageal cancer patients. Prevention and early detection represent the mainstay in the ongoing struggle to improve prognosis, which is most strin-gently linked to tumor stage. Other efforts have been dedicated to optimise surgical treatment, radiotherapy and chemotherapy and to discover the most efficient combinations of these treat-ment modalities. Strong but not <b>unanimous</b> <b>evidence</b> in favour of a multimodality approach with chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery has accumulated in recent years, and confirmatory trials are presently ongoing. A pathological complete response to chemoradiotherapy has been identified to significantly en-hance survival. Among the strategies to achieve higher response rates, variations in the administration of the most commonly used drugs rather than higher drug and radiation dosages seem promising. Occult lymphatic spread has been recognised as a major source of recurrence and has been successfully targeted by three field surgical dissection and extended field radiotherapy. In search of the optimal treatment for patients with oeso-phageal cancer, a variety of different tracks are being pursued. This review outlines and analyses current treatment approaches and investigates how recent advances may impact on patient management.

40|$|Therapeutic {{hypothermia}} (TH) following {{cardiac arrest}} is commonplace in many hospitals and intensive care units {{around the globe}} as this treatment is thought to improve survival rates and offer neuroprotective benefits. However, its use in the pre-hospital arena is still uncertain with conflicting or little {{evidence to support the}} timing, mode of delivery or potential benefit for the patient. The objective of this literature review is to collect and consider evidence and address these uncertainties with a view to offering recommendations for practice. Methods: A systematic search was undertaken of 2 databases – EBSCOhost and Pubmed – using a Boolean search strategy. This literature review also included hand searched articles to ensure that a full and comprehensive scope of evidence was collated and included. Papers were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: •	Studies between 2005 – 2014 •	Full text •	English language •	Human subjects •	Pre – hospital studies. Papers were excluded if they met the following criteria: •	Non – human subjects •	In – hospital studies •	Trauma •	Children •	Studies prior to 2005. In – hospital studies were not included in this review due to the focus being specifically around pre-hospital care. It was also taken into consideration that individual hospitals would potentially have different specialities within them and also differing guidelines and protocols surrounding the implementation of TH. Results: Three specific areas of TH were analysed – the implementation of TH during the cardiac arrest, the mode of initiating TH – either by cooling pads, by using RhinoChill or by infusion of cold fluids - and whether there were clear neurological and survival benefits for the patient. The results from the studies analysed were unable to provide clear evidence into the benefits of the implementation of intra-arrest TH, although there was some evidence to suggest that one subgroup that received early CPR alongside early TH had improved survival outcomes. In regards to the mode of instigating TH, cooling efficacy was proved in all methods evaluated, although each method had some potential negative outcomes associated with its usage. The final area of analysis showed conflicting evidence around potential survival and neurological outcomes for the patient. Two of the three papers could not support claims that TH improved survival to discharge or improved neurological status, whilst the third paper noted a higher instance of favourable neurological outcomes. Conclusions: From the literature reviewed, there is no <b>unanimous</b> <b>evidence</b> that prehospital TH improves patient survival or neurological outcomes. It is clear that all of the different modes of initiating TH that were evaluated were all effective in reducing patient temperature on arrival at hospital...|$|E
