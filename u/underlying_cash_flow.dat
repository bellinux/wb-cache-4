Much of Slim's business dealings involved a simple strategy, which is to buy a business and hang on to it for its cash flow or eventually sell the stake at a greater profit in future, thereby netting the capital gains as well as reinvesting the initial principal into a new business. In addition, his conglomerate structure allows Slim to purchase numerous stakes that it is made nearly recession proof if one or more sectors of the economy do not do well. Slim also doesn't address the finer details of the business but instead focuses on business fundamentals where his strategy is buy an asset at an undervalued price for its <b>underlying</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and eventually sell his stake for greater profit when the asset gains value, or simply hang to the business for its cash flow.|$|E

40|$|Much {{attention}} {{has been focused on}} the usefulness of <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> numbers as variables used in predicting the future <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> of an entity. Paradoxically, little {{attention has}} been paid to how earnings move relative to <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> over a sustained time period. This thesis addresses the issue and analyses the financial information from the annual reports of New Zealand listed companies for the 21 year period, 1971 - 1991. The evidence shows that there has been wide variation between earnings and the <b>underlying</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> during the 1980 s. The two years following the 1987 stock market collapse appears to have had a reduced degree of variation between the earnings and <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> variables. This suggests that post-crash the attention on financial reporting was influential in reducing the degree of variation between earnings and the <b>underlying</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> The study also examines the data scaled and with outliers removed. Scaling indicates that non-current accruals are more important for large companies while removal of outliers has little effect on the results. Data on actual <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> were analysed for the period 1989 - 1991. The results indicate that the variation between earnings and actual <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> is quite high. The contextual relationship between changes in each of the accounting variables (earnings and <b>cash</b> <b>flows)</b> and changes in macroeconomic indicators (gdp, money supply and inflation) was investigated. The evidence is that the association between changes in the macroeconomic indicators and changes in the accounting variables is not particularly strong and that changes in both money supply and inflation are of more importance than changes in gdp. An industry by industry analysis provides evidence showing that for most industries there is little association between changes in the accounting variables and changes in economic indicators. There is evidence that some industries are more sensitive than others to macroeconomic changes. This evidence is enhanced when the data are partitioned in a way which allows low, medium and high changes in macroeconomic activity to be analyzed separately. The conclusion of the study is that although the largest proportion of variation in accounting numbers is explained by factors other than changes in the economy there is sufficient evidence to suggest that for some industries the impact of changes in macroeconomic conditionss is greater than for others...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} examines {{whether the}} fair value of mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) based on managerial inputs (Level 3) better reflects the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and risk {{characteristics of the}} underlying assets than the fair value of MSRs based on market inputs (Level 2).

Standard fixed-income measurements, which allow investors to compare different types of bonds, include price, yield, average life, duration and convexity.

40|$|While prior {{research}} suggests that firms have primarily switched from accrual to real earnings management strategies since {{the passage of the}} Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) (Cohen, Dey, and Lys 2008), there has been limited research on the effects that this switch might have on future performance and firm value. Accrual earnings management shifts income recognition without directly affecting <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> whereas real earnings management implies suboptimal decisions that directly affect the <b>underlying</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> Thus, this shift in earnings management techniques could have important consequences for investors. Consistent with increased real earnings management post-SOX, we find that abnormal operating decisions are less informative about future return on assets (ROA) and have a more negative effect on firm value relative to the pre-SOX period. Alternatively, consistent with less accrual earnings management post-SOX, we find that discretionary accruals are more informative about future ROA and there is less evidence of market mispricing relative to the pre-SOX period. Finally, we examine the net effect that SOX has had on earnings management and find that the lower future returns and firm performance associated with greater real earnings management outweigh the positive effects of improved accrual quality...|$|R

The existence of two market prices for claims to the same set of <b>underlying</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> closely resembles the closed-end fund (CEF) discount puzzle. In the case of ADRs, we can rule out the tax, and agency cost explanations. Hence, Indian ADRs provide a better setting to examine the evidence for investor sentiment influencing market prices. Consistent with such an influence, we find that ADR premiums are positively related to orderimbalance of small ADR trades. The premiums associated with the small trades are reversed in two weeks. We control for price pressure effects by including order-imbalance of all trades. Also, premiums are negatively related to the volatility implied by S&P 500 index option prices (VIX) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{crisis of}} 2007 - 09 has been {{characterized}} by a sudden freeze {{in the market for}} short-term, secured borrowing. We present a model that can explain a sudden collapse in the amount that can be borrowed against finitely-lived assets with little credit risk. The borrowing in this model {{takes the form of a}} repurchase agreement ("repo") or asset-backed commercial paper that has to be rolled over several times before the underlying assets mature and their true value is revealed. In the event of default, the creditors can seize the collateral. We assume that there is a small cost of liquidating the assets. The debt capacity of the assets (the maximum amount that can be borrowed using the assets as collateral) depends on the information state of the economy. At each date, in general there is either "good news" (the information state improves), "bad news" (the information state gets worse), or "no news" (the information state remains the same). When rollover risk is high, because debt must be rolled over frequently, we show that the debt capacity is lower than the fundamental value of the asset and in extreme cases may be close to zero. This is true even if the fundamental value of the assets is high in all states. Thus, a small change in information, as measured by a change in the fundamental value, can lead to a "market freeze. " Interpreted differently, the model explains why discounts in overnight repo borrowing, the so-called "haircuts," rose dramatically during the crisis for asset-backed securities with low credit risk once bad news about the <b>underlying</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> arrived. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{shares of}} the DLC parents {{represent}} claims on exactly the same <b>underlying</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> In integrated and efficient financial markets, stock prices of the DLC parents should therefore move in lockstep. In practice, however, large differences from theoretical price parity can arise. For example, in the early 1980s Royal Dutch NV was trading at a discount of approximately 30% relative to Shell Transport and Trading PLC. In the academic finance literature, Rosenthal and Young (1990) and Froot and Dabora (1999) show that significant mispricing in three DLCs (Royal Dutch Shell, Unilever, and Smithkline Beecham) has existed {{over a long period}} of time. Both studies conclude that fundamental factors (such as currency risk, governance structures, legal contracts, liquidity, and taxation) are not sufficient to explain the magnitude of the price deviations. Froot and Dabora (1999) show that the relative prices of the twin stocks are correlated with the stock indices of the markets on which each of the twins has its main listing. For example, if the FTSE 100 rises relative to the AEX index (the Dutch stock market index) the stock price of Reed International PLC generally tends to rise relative to the stock price of Elsevier NV. De Jong, Rosenthal, and van Dijk (2008) report similar effects for nine other DLCs. A potential explanation is that local market sentiment affects the relative prices of the {{shares of the}} DLC parent companies. Because of the absence of [...] "fundamental reasons" [...] for the mispricing, DLCs have become known as a textbook example of arbitrage opportunities, see for example Brealey, Myers, and Allen (2006, chapter 13).|$|R
40|$|A common {{method of}} valuing the equity in {{leveraged}} transactions is the flows-toequity method whereby the free <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> available to equity holders is discounted {{at the cost}} of equity.

40|$|Purpose of {{the study}} Circuit breaker is a market {{mechanism}} intended to curb excessive volatility by halting continuous trading after a significant intraday price deviation. Existing literature identifies four key problems with circuit breakers: magnet pull effect, delayed price discovery, trading interference and volatility spillover. The empirical literature on market wide circuit breakers is limited {{due to lack of}} observations. This thesis contributes to existing literature by bridging the gap between empirical research on price limits affecting individual securities and theoretical literature on market wide circuit breakers by being the first to empirically test the four aforementioned hypotheses using the case of China’s circuit breaker implemented between 4. 1. - 7. 1. 2016. Data and methodology The data consists of A shares of Shanghai listed CSI 300 index constituents, and their Hong Kong traded H shares for the dual listed companies. In addition to the event window, the data for control samples extends from 1. 1. 2011 to 31. 3. 2016. The hypotheses are tested by comparing the circuit breaker sample to two control samples: 1) A ”matched” control sample, where an observation with the closest corresponding intraday return is matched with a circuit breaker day observation. 2) Hong Kong control sample, where the dual listed A shares are compared to their corresponding Hong Kong listed H-shares. This approach is novel to this branch of literature, and is more robust in the sense that both A- and H-shares react simultaneously to same information regarding the <b>underlying</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> Findings I find, that shares with low market capitalization, high market correlation, high turnover and tight bid-ask spreads perform the worst during the circuit breaker. I also find strong evidence of magnet pull hypothesis in the form of increased selling pressure in the close proximity to the circuit breaker trigger level. I find no significant evidence of delayed price discovery or trading interference. Furthermore, I find evidence of volatility spillover caused by increased uncertainty as proxied by relative bid-ask spread. I show that in anticipation to circuit breaker’s implementation, sophisticated investors prefer to trade in Hong Kong markets that are unaffected by the policy. Furthermore, by analyzing the dual listed shares I show that in a market affected by circuit breaker this ’migration of trading volume’ magnifies the feedback loop behavior that is driving magnet pull, but mitigates the same problems in the absence of one. Findings are mostly consistent with empirical literature on price limits, and differ in ways that would be expected based on theoretical framework. The results imply that circuit breaker caused the problems it is intended to solve...|$|R

40|$|Like {{any other}} asset, it is {{important}} for investors to value accurately their mortgage portfolio. This valuation will not be precise without available information on the <b>underlying</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> To evaluate mortgages properly, they need to have reliable information not only on the scheduled payments, but also on all payments not expected to occur over the duration of the mortgage, either partial prepayments (curtailments) or total prepayments. Currently, in Portugal, the information used is based on international studies. It was not possible to find evidence about Portuguese prepayment studies. The experience of working with mortgages indicated that levels of prepayments referred in most literature (about 6 % of the outstanding principal) would be lower in Portugal. The information about prepayments is relevant to several intervenients in mortgages: financial institutions that lend and need to assess their portfolio; lenders who use scoring systems / pricing and need to incorporate information from expected levels of prepayment; investors in Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) and rating agencies that evaluate institutions and portfolios. This work involved a first major challenge of getting data (in significant numbers) from the financial institutions about total and partial prepayments {{in order to have a}} reliable data base. This information is not easily available and this goal was achieved only with the support of one of the largest credit institutions in the country (which prefers to remain anonymous due to confidentiality reasons). After clarification meetings about the study and its relevance, COO and Administration became interested in the study, approving data delivery. This institution provided prepayments data from the year 2000 until 2012. This allowed us to gather about 747. 000 records of information. Only knowledge about mortgages, about the institution, its database and the extraordinary collaboration of this institution’s staff enabled all data treatment and validation. Historical prepayments and seasoned prepayments were calculated as a percentage of the total prepayments in each period (month or maturity) over the total mortgage amount. This analysis revealed low levels of prepayment. The average prepayment level of 1, 21 % was well below the usually referred 6 % level. Then, the data was associated with some macro-economic variables (mainly factors referred to in literature) in order to characterize how prepayments were correlated to those indicators. This analysis allowed us to understand which variables were most strongly correlated with prepayments. During the analysis period a Decree-Law (DL) was enacted that limited the level of penalties on prepayments. We assayed the DL’s effect at the prepayments level. In order to get a predictive tool, we regressed prepayments as a function of most significant variables and formulated a predictive model, with a 12 months lag. This model revealed to have a considerable level of significance...|$|R

These <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> are the basis for the valuation of a firm or project. The operating <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> is analyzed as well. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} predictive ability of direct method <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> information for firms {{that use the}} direct method in their <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> statements. We use cross sectional and pooled time series regressions to predict operating <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> data and assess relative predictive ability. Principal findings are: (1) past period direct method <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> data predict future operating <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> better than indirect method <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> data; (2) past period direct method gross operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> predict future net operating <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> better than past period net operating cash flow; (3) measurement error exists in estimates of direct method operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> from other financial statement data; (4) past operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> predict future operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> better than earnings and accruals.

40|$|<b>Cash</b> <b>flow</b> {{prediction}} {{is involved in}} a number of economic decisions, particularly in investment. Previous research conducted in the United States has provided inconsistency in the results of investigating accounting data, <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and accrual accounting data in predicting future <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> No published research has studied <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> prediction in Thailand. The current study investigates the ability of accrual and <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> accounting data to predict future <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> of Thai listed companies. Three regression models are constructed namely earnings, <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> accrual components and <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> models. In addition, <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> ratios are investigated to predict future <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> by using a stepwise regression. Data used in this study is collected from the financial statements of non-financial companies listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand from 1994 to 2002. <b>Cash</b> <b>flow</b> data are selected directly from the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> statements. The empirical results show that past earnings, <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and accrual component of earnings can be used to predict future <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> of Thai listed companies and <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> have better predictive power than past earnings. Additionally, the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model and the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and accrual components of earnings model have better predictive power than the earnings model. The findings of testing the models in an out-of-sample period suggest that the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model is a better predictor of future <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> than the other models. Furthermore, additional year lags of accounting data can improve the predictive power of the model. However, the results indicate that <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> ratios are not a good predictor of future <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> In addition, this study finds that the Asian economic crisis {{had an impact on the}} predictive power of accounting data...|$|R
50|$|Payback {{period is}} usually {{expressed}} in years. Start by calculating Net <b>Cash</b> <b>Flow</b> for each year: Net <b>Cash</b> <b>Flow</b> Year 1 = Cash Inflow Year 1 - Cash Outflow Year 1. Then Cumulative <b>Cash</b> <b>Flow</b> = (Net <b>Cash</b> <b>Flow</b> Year 1 + Net <b>Cash</b> <b>Flow</b> Year 2 + Net <b>Cash</b> <b>Flow</b> Year 3, etc.) Accumulate by year until Cumulative <b>Cash</b> <b>Flow</b> {{is a positive}} number: that year is the payback year.|$|R
30|$|Further {{analyses}} {{show that}} zero point, last year’s <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and analyst <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> forecast {{are the three}} thresholds that influence managers’ decision when they report <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> performance. Over 16 % of the firms with small positive <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> manipulate their <b>cash</b> <b>flow.</b> Moreover, 16.64 % of the firms with small changes in <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and 9.81 % of the firms with small surprises manipulate <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> to reach the targets. A comparative analysis shows that <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> management behaviors around zero and zero changes are more prevalent in the Chinese market than in the U.S. market. <b>Cash</b> <b>flow</b> management around analyst <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> forecasts, however, is no more prevalent than that in the U.S. market.|$|R
