5|$|Rockall {{is a small}} rocky islet in the North Atlantic {{which was}} {{declared}} part of Scotland by the Island of Rockall Act 1972. However, despite no posession by any other state and other precedents, {{the legality of the}} claim is disputed by the Republic of Ireland, Denmark and Iceland and some say, it is may be <b>unenforceable</b> in international law.|$|E
5|$|The Afroyim {{decision}} {{opened the}} way for a wider acceptance of dual (or multiple) citizenship in United States law. The Bancroft Treaties—a series of agreements between the United States and other nations which had sought to limit dual citizenship following naturalization—were eventually abandoned after the Carter administration concluded that Afroyim and other Supreme Court decisions had rendered them <b>unenforceable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Madison {{argued that}} a state, after declaring a federal law unconstitutional, could take action by {{communicating}} with other states, attempting to enlist their support, petitioning Congress to repeal the law in question, introducing amendments to the Constitution in Congress, or calling a constitutional convention. Madison did not assert that the states could legally nullify an objectionable federal law or that they could declare it void and <b>unenforceable.</b> By eschewing direct action in favor of influencing popular opinion, Madison tried {{to make clear that}} the Democratic-Republicans were not moving toward disunion.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its history, the {{coverage}} formula remained controversial because it singled out certain jurisdictions, {{most of which}} were in the Deep South. In Shelby County v. Holder (2013), the Supreme Court declared {{the coverage}} formula unconstitutional because the criteria used were outdated and thus violated principles of equal state sovereignty and federalism. The other special provisions that are dependent on the coverage formula, such as the Section 5 preclearance requirement, remain valid law. However, without a valid coverage formula, these provisions are <b>unenforceable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few decades, {{economic}} opportunities increased for the English peasantry. Some labourers took up specialist jobs that would have previously been barred to them, and others moved from employer to employer, or became servants in richer households. These changes were keenly felt across the south-east of England, where the London market created {{a wide range of}} opportunities for farmers and artisans. Local lords had the right to prevent serfs from leaving their manors, but when serfs found themselves blocked in the manorial courts, many simply left to work illegally on manors elsewhere. Wages continued to rise, and between the 1340s and the 1380s the purchasing power of rural labourers increased by around 40 percent. As the wealth of the lower classes increased, Parliament brought in fresh laws in 1363 to prevent them from consuming expensive goods formerly only affordable by the elite. These sumptuary laws proved <b>unenforceable,</b> but the wider labour laws continued to be firmly applied.|$|E
5|$|Rudd was {{offering}} generous terms that few competitors {{could hope to}} even come close to. If Lobengula agreed, Rudd's backers would furnish the king with 1,000 Martini–Henry breech-loading rifles, 100,000 rounds of matching ammunition, a steamboat on the Zambezi (or, if Lobengula preferred, a lump sum of £500), and £100 a month in perpetuity. More impressive to the king than the financial aspects of this offer were the weapons: he {{had at the time}} between 600 and 800 rifles and carbines, but almost no ammunition for them. The proposed arrangement would lavishly stock his arsenal with both firearms and bullets, which might prove decisive in the event of conflict with the South African Republic. The weapons might also help him keep control of the more rambunctious factions amid his own impis. Lobengula had Helm go over the document with him several times, in great detail, to ensure that he properly understood what was written. None of Rudd's alleged oral conditions were in the concession document, making them legally <b>unenforceable</b> (presuming they indeed existed), but the king apparently regarded them as part of the proposed agreement nonetheless.|$|E
5|$|Tulips {{grow from}} bulbs, {{and can be}} {{propagated}} through both seeds and buds. Seeds from a tulip will form a flowering bulb after 7–12 years. When a bulb grows into the flower, the original bulb will disappear, but a clone bulb forms in its place, as do several buds. Properly cultivated, these buds will become bulbs of their own. The mosaic virus spreads only through buds, not seeds, and so cultivating the most appealing varieties takes years. Propagation is greatly slowed down by the virus. In the Northern Hemisphere, tulips bloom in April and May for about one week. During the plant's dormant phase from (Northern Hemisphere) June to September, bulbs can be uprooted and moved about, so actual purchases (in the spot market) occurred during these months. During {{the rest of the}} year, florists, or tulip traders, signed contracts before a notary to buy tulips {{at the end of the}} season (effectively futures contracts). Thus the Dutch, who developed many of the techniques of modern finance, created a market for tulip bulbs, which were durable goods. Short selling was banned by an edict of 1610, which was reiterated or strengthened in 1621 and 1630, and again in 1636. Short sellers were not prosecuted under these edicts, but their contracts were deemed <b>unenforceable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Arbitration clauses of {{companies}} such as AT and Ralphs have been ruled unconscionable and, therefore, <b>unenforceable.</b> However arbitration clauses have been upheld repeatedly as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{historical}} {{institution and}} legal contract solemnizing {{the relationship of}} one man and one woman shall be the only legally recognized marital contract in this state. Any policy or law or judicial interpretation, purporting to define marriage {{as anything other than}} the historical institution and legal contract between one man and one woman is contrary to the public policy of this state and shall be void and <b>unenforceable</b> in Tennessee. If another state or foreign jurisdiction issues a license for persons to marry and if such marriage is prohibited in this state by the provisions of this section, then the marriage shall be void and <b>unenforceable</b> in this state.|$|E
25|$|Entering into {{contracts}} for {{the fulfillment of}} other functions within its powers. However a contract between a municipality and another party to do something outside of its charter is ultra vires, and therefore <b>unenforceable</b> as a nullity.|$|E
25|$|Wilson's {{position}} that nationwide Prohibition was <b>unenforceable</b> {{came to pass}} as a black market quickly developed to evade restrictions, and considerable liquor was both manufactured and smuggled into the country. Speakeasies thrived in cities, towns and rural areas.|$|E
25|$|A Superior Court jury {{ruled that}} the {{contract}} was <b>unenforceable,</b> Universal Pictures having entered into it under duress, and that Ponce and Oliver were obliged to return {{the difference between the}} $250,000 Universal had thus far paid and the $80,000 originally negotiated.|$|E
25|$|The English Cricket Board {{ruled that}} a player must not have {{represented}} their own country for over twelve months {{in order to qualify}} for Kolpak status but after South African Jacques Rudolph signed for Yorkshire, they admitted that this rule was <b>unenforceable.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} noted that the {{restrictions}} on ministers and atheists have been deemed to be <b>unenforceable</b> due to the interpretations of the Supreme Court of the United States with regard to the First and the Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.|$|E
25|$|Sexual acts between {{persons of}} the same sex are legal in Louisiana. They were {{previously}} criminalized under the state's sodomy law, which applied to both homosexuals and heterosexuals. The law was rendered <b>unenforceable</b> in 2003 by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Lawrence v. Texas.|$|E
25|$|To {{solve the}} problem of libel tourism, the SPEECH Act makes foreign libel {{judgments}} <b>unenforceable</b> in U.S. courts, unless those judgments are compliant with the U.S. First Amendment. The act was passed by the 111th United States Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama.|$|E
25|$|In January 2012, Brownback did {{not include}} Kansas's sodomy law in a list of unenforced and {{outdated}} laws that the legislature should repeal. Gay rights advocates had asked his administration to recommend its repeal because the law has been <b>unenforceable</b> since the Supreme Court's Lawrence v. Texas decision in 2003.|$|E
25|$|Beginning with Vermont in 1777, {{most states}} {{north of the}} Ohio River and the Mason–Dixon line {{abolished}} slavery. These states enacted the first abolition laws in the entire New World. Slavery in Massachusetts was abolished by the judiciary. The constitution adopted in 1780 declared all men to have rights, making slavery <b>unenforceable.</b>|$|E
25|$|One {{threat to}} the large flying fox is habitat destruction. Flying foxes are {{sometimes}} hunted for food, and the controls on hunting seem to be <b>unenforceable.</b> In some areas, farmers consider them pests as they sometimes feed on their orchards. This species is also hunted for bushmeat in Indonesia, contributing to its decline.|$|E
25|$|Under Gowen's leadership, the Reading Railroad {{went from}} being legally {{prohibited}} by its corporate charter against owning or operating coal mines, to owning 142 square miles (368km²) of coal lands — with that legal prohibition still in place, but deemed {{by the state of}} Pennsylvania to be <b>unenforceable</b> — and running numerous mining operations upon them.|$|E
25|$|The Privy Council {{disagreed}} in Nireaha Tamaki v Baker, {{and other}} rulings, but courts in New Zealand continued to hand down decisions materially similar to Wi Parata. The Coal Mines Amendment Act 1903 and the Native Land Act 1909 declared aboriginal title <b>unenforceable</b> against the Crown. Eventually, the Privy Council acquiesced {{to the view}} that the Treaty was non-justiciable.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of playing chess for money became so widespread during the 13th century that Louis IX of France issued an ordinance against gambling in 1254. This ordinance {{turned out to}} be <b>unenforceable</b> and was largely neglected by the common public, and even the courtly society, which continued to enjoy the now prohibited chess tournaments uninterrupted.|$|E
25|$|Buckeye Check Cashing Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U.S. 440 (2006), is a United States Supreme Court case {{concerning}} {{contract law}} and arbitration. The case arose from {{a class action}} filed in Florida against a payday lender alleging the loan agreements the plaintiffs had signed were <b>unenforceable</b> because they essentially charged a higher interest rate than that permitted under Florida law.|$|E
25|$|Souter also {{disagrees with}} the Court's {{rejection}} of Ex parte Young, noting that where Chilicky was {{a rejection of the}} extra-statutory remedy proposed, Young was merely a jurisdictional device. Souter found it implausible that Congress would wish to see their statute made completely <b>unenforceable</b> simply because they had included a remedy for those injured by the failure of states to abide by it.|$|E
25|$|The ILA renewed {{its efforts}} to {{reestablish}} itself on the West Coast, chartering a new local in San Francisco in 1933. With the passage that year of the National Industrial Recovery Act, which contained some encouraging but <b>unenforceable</b> provisions declaring that workers {{had the right to}} organize unions of their own choice, thousands of longshoremen joined the new ILA local.|$|E
25|$|Cohen {{sponsored}} the SPEECH Act banning {{the practice of}} libel tourism, rendering libel lawsuits <b>unenforceable</b> if the judgments were issued {{in a nation where}} the legal standard for libel is set lower than our own. The Senate Sponsor was Senator Patrick Leahy. The bill passed both houses of Congress in July 2010 and was signed into law by President Barack Obama the following month.|$|E
25|$|Another {{argument}} made by tax protesters {{is that a}} given {{section of}} the statute (i.e., a given section of the Internal Revenue Code) must be supported by an implementing regulation for that particular section in order for that section to be legally valid, or {{that the lack of}} an implementing regulation for that section makes that section <b>unenforceable.</b> This argument has been uniformly rejected by the courts.|$|E
25|$|Several {{states have}} {{language}} included in their constitutions that requires state office-holders to have particular religious beliefs. These include Arkansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. Some of these beliefs (or oaths) were historically required of jurors and witnesses in court. Even {{though they are}} still on the books, these provisions have been rendered <b>unenforceable</b> by U.S. Supreme Court decisions.|$|E
25|$|SCO {{has also}} claimed, in {{early stages of}} the litigation, that the GPL is invalid and {{non-binding}} and legally <b>unenforceable.</b> In response, supporters of the GPL, such as Eben Moglen, claimed that SCO's right to distribute Linux relied upon the GPL being a valid copyright license. Later court filings by the SCO Group in SCO v. IBM use SCO's alleged compliance with the license as a defense to IBM's counterclaims.|$|E
25|$|Each of {{the parties}} {{involved}} worked to facilitate the controversial Braddock-Louis matchup. Louis did his part by knocking out former champion Jack Sharkey on August 18, 1936. Meanwhile, Gould trumped up anti-Nazi sentiment against Schmeling, and Jacobs defended a lawsuit by MSG to halt the Braddock-Louis fight. A federal court in Newark, New Jersey, eventually ruled that Braddock's contractual obligation to stage his title defense at MSG was <b>unenforceable</b> for lack of mutual consideration.|$|E
25|$|Despite the Supreme Court's decision, anti-miscegenation laws {{remained}} on the books in several states, although the decision had made them <b>unenforceable.</b> Local judges in Alabama continued to enforce that state's anti-miscegenation statute until the Nixon administration obtained a ruling from a U.S. District Court in United States v. Brittain in 1970. In 2000, Alabama became the last state to adapt its laws to the Supreme Court's decision, when 60% of voters endorsed a ballot initiative that removed anti-miscegenation language from the state constitution.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{domestic}} and social agreements {{such as those}} between children and parents are typically <b>unenforceable</b> {{on the basis of}} public policy. For example, in the English case Balfour v. Balfour a husband agreed to give his wife £30 a month while he was away from home, but the court refused to enforce the agreement when the husband stopped paying. In contrast, in Merritt v Merritt the court enforced an agreement between an estranged couple because the circumstances suggested their agreement was more than a domestic arrangement.|$|E
25|$|Claims {{that some}} of the {{provisions}} of the tax code are unconstitutional are submissions of a different order. They do not arise from innocent mistakes caused by the complexity of the Internal Revenue Code. Rather, they reveal full knowledge of the provisions at issue and a studied conclusion, however wrong, that those provisions are invalid and <b>unenforceable.</b> Thus, in this case, Cheek paid his taxes for years, but after attending various seminars and based on his own study, he concluded that the income tax laws could not constitutionally require him to pay a tax.|$|E
25|$|In November 1832 the Nullification Convention met. The {{convention}} {{declared that}} the tariffs of 1828 and 1832 were unconstitutional and <b>unenforceable</b> within the state of South Carolina after February 1, 1833. They said that attempts {{to use force to}} collect the taxes would lead to the state’s secession. Robert Hayne, who followed Hamilton as governor in 1833, established a 2,000-man group of mounted minutemen and 25,000 infantry who would march to Charleston {{in the event of a}} military conflict. These troops were to be armed with $100,000 in arms purchased in the North.|$|E
25|$|Much {{substantive}} {{due process}} litigation involves legal challenges about unenumerated rights that seek particular outcomes instead of merely contesting procedures and their effects. In successful cases, the Supreme Court recognizes a constitutionally based liberty that considers laws {{that seek to}} limit that liberty to be <b>unenforceable</b> or limited in scope. Critics of substantive due process decisions usually assert {{that there is no}} textual basis in the Constitution for such protection and that such liberties should be left under the purview of the more politically accountable branches of government.|$|E
25|$|Francione's Animals, Property, and the Law (1995) was {{the first}} {{extensive}} jurisprudential treatment of animal rights. In it, Francione compares the situation of animals {{to the treatment of}} slaves in the United States, where legislation existed that appeared to protect them, while the courts ignored that the institution of slavery itself rendered the protection <b>unenforceable.</b> He offers as an example the United States Animal Welfare Act, which he describes as an example of symbolic legislation, intended to assuage public concern about the treatment of animals, but difficult to implement.|$|E
