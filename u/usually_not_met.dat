40|$|Intrinsic and {{extrinsic}} self-healing approaches {{through which}} materials can be healed generally suffer from several problems. One key {{problem is that}} to ensure effective healing and to minimise the propagation of a fault, the healing rate needs to be matched to the damage rate. This requirement is <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> <b>met</b> with passive approaches. An alternative to passive healing is active self-healing, whereby the healing mechanism {{and in particular the}} healing rate, is controlled in the face of uncertainty and varying conditions. Active self-healing takes advantage of sensing and added external energy to achieve a desired healing rate. To demonstrate active self-healing, an electrochemical material based on the principles of piezoelectricity and electrolysis is modelled and adaptive feedback control is implemented. The adaptive feedback control compensates for the insufficient piezo-induced voltage and guarantees a response that meets the desired healing rate. Importantly, fault propagation can be eliminated or minimised by attaining a match between the healing and damage rate quicker than can be achieved with the equivalent passive system. The desired healing rate {{is a function of the}} fault propagation and is assumed known in this paper, but can be estimated in practice through established prognostic techniques. ...|$|E
40|$|Person re-identification (ReID) {{focuses on}} {{identifying}} people across different scenes in video surveillance, {{which is usually}} formulated as a binary classification task or a ranking task in current person ReID approaches. In this paper, we take both tasks into account and propose a multi-task deep network (MTDnet) that makes use of their own advantages and jointly optimize the two tasks simultaneously for person ReID. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, we are the first to integrate both tasks in one network to solve the person ReID. We show that our proposed architecture significantly boosts the performance. Furthermore, deep architecture in general requires a sufficient dataset for training, which is <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> <b>met</b> in person ReID. To cope with this situation, we further extend the MTDnet and propose a cross-domain architecture that is capable of using an auxiliary set to assist training on small target sets. In the experiments, our approach outperforms most of existing person ReID algorithms on representative datasets including CUHK 03, CUHK 01, VIPeR, iLIDS and PRID 2011, which clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

In this framework, inductive hypotheses {{can be generated}} even if the background knowledge {{is not sufficient to}} generate hypotheses in an usual manner.

40|$|Between 1980 and 2000 Gertrude Starink (1947 - 2002) {{published}} five {{collections of}} poems entitled DE WEG NAAR EGYPTE (THE WAY TO EGYPT). She called her poems “passages”.

40|$|There {{exists a}} {{considerable}} amount of research claiming a puzzling anti-correlation between the neutrino detection rate at the Homestake experiment and indicators of solar activity such as the sunspot number, giving rise to explanations involving the hypothesis of a neutrino magnetic moment. It is argued here that the claimed significant anti-correlation is due to a statistical fallacy. A proper test based on certain optimality criteria fails to detect a significant time variation of the neutrino flux in concert with the sunspot number, providing evidence that the observations are consistent with no correlation between the two series. 1 Solar neutrinos are the only known particles to reach Earth directly from the solar core and thus allow to test directly the theories of stellar evolution and nuclear energy generation [1]. A perceived anti-correlation between the neutrino detection rate at the Homestake experiment [6] and indicators of solar activity such as the sunspot number has been the object of {{a considerable amount}} of research [2 – 12], yielding claims of statistically highly significant results. Such time variations of the solar neutrino flux are not possible in minimal standard electroweak theory and have motivated proposals for solutions of the solar neutrino problem based upon the hypothesis of a large neutrino magnetic moment [13 – 16]. However, the standard tests for correlation used in the research cited above require assumptions that are <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> <b>met</b> in a time-series context, where these tests may readily produce erroneous, highly significant results.

40|$|Alfalfa-reference {{evapotranspiration}} (ETr) values sometimes need to {{be converted}} to grass-reference ET (ETo), or vice versa, to enable crop coefficients developed for one reference surface {{to be used with}} the other. However, guidelines to make these conversions are lacking. The objectives of this study were to: (1) develop ETr to ETo ratios (Kr values) for different climatic regions for the growing season and nongrowing (dormant) seasons; and (2) determine the seasonal behavior of Kr values between the locations and in the same location for different seasons. Monthly average Kr values from daily values were developed for Bushland, (Tex.), Clay Center, (Neb.), Davis, (Calif.), Gainesville, (Fla.), Phoenix (Ariz.), and Rockport, (Mo.) for the calendar year and for the growing season (May– September). ETr and ETo values that were used to determine Kr values were calculated by several methods. Methods included the standardized American Society of Civil Engineers Penman–Monteith (ASCE-PM), Food and Agriculture Organization Paper 56 (FAO 56) equation (68), 1972 and 1982 Kimberly-Penman, 1963 Jensen-Haise, and the High Plains Regional Climate Center (HPRCC) Penman. The Kr values determined by the same and different methods exhibited substantial variations among locations. For example, the Kr values developed with the ASCE-PM method in July were 1. 38, 1. 27, 1. 32, 1. 11, 1. 28, and 1. 19, for Bushland, Clay Center, Davis, Gainesville, Phoenix, and Rockport, respectively. The variability in the Kr values among locations justifies the need for developing local Kr values because the values {{did not appear to be}} transferable among locations. In general, variations in Kr values were less for the growing season than for the calendar year. Average standard deviation between years was maximum 0. 13 for the calendar year and maximum 0. 10 for the growing season. The ASCE-PM Kr values had less variability among locations than those obtained with other methods. The FAO 56 procedure Kr values had higher variability among locations, especially for areas with low relative humidity and high wind speed. The 1972 Kim-Pen method resulted in the closest Kr values compared with the ASCE-PM method at all locations. Some of the methods, including the ASCE-PM, produced potentially unrealistically high Kr values (e. g., 1. 78, 1. 80) during the nongrowing season, which could be due to instabilities and uncertainties that exist when estimating ETr and ETo in dormant season since the hypothetical reference conditions are <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> <b>met</b> during this period in most locations. Because simultaneous and direct measurements of the ETr and ETo values rarely exist, it appears that the approach of ETr to ETo ratios calculated with the ASCE-PM method is currently the best approach available to derive Kr values for locations where these measurements are not available. The Kr values developed in this study can be useful for making conversions from ETr to ETo, or vice versa, to enable using crop coefficients developed for one reference surface with the other to determine actual crop water use for locations, with similar climatic characteristics of this study, when locally measured Kr values are not available...|$|E

40|$|E. Fermi, J. Pasta and S. Ulam {{introduced}} the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam lattice in the 1950 s as a classical mechanical {{model for a}} mono-atomic crystal or a one-dimensional continuum. The model consisted of a discrete number of equal point masses that interact with their nearest neighbours only. On the basis of statistical mechanics, they expected that when the interparticle forces were anharmonic, the lattice would reach a thermal equilibrium. This means that averaged over time, its initial energy would be equipartitioned among all its Fourier modes. The famous computer experiment that they performed in Los Alamos in 1955, was intended to investigate in what manner and at what time-scale the equipartitioning would take place. The result was astonishing: the lattice {{did not come close}} to thermal equilibrium, but behaved more or less quasi-periodically. Only when the initial energy was larger than a certain threshold, did the lattice seem to `thermalise'. This paradox is nowadays known as the `Fermi-Pasta-Ulam problem'. The observations of Fermi, Pasta and Ulam were a great impulse for nonlinear dynamics. One possible explanation for the quasi-periodic behaviour of the FPU system, is based on the Kolmogorov-Arnol'd-Moser theorem, which states that most of the invariant Lagrangean tori of a Liouville integrable Hamiltonian system survive under small perturbations. It is required though for the KAM theorem that the integrable system satisfies a nondegeneracy condition. Unfortunately, it has for a long time been unclear how the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam lattice {{can be viewed as a}} perturbation of a nondegenerate integrable system. Nishida in 1971 and Sanders in 1977, investigated a Birkhoff normal form for the FPU lattice. Under the assumption of a rather strong nonresonance condition on the linear frequencies ω_k = 2 sin (kπ/n) of the lattice, they showed that this Birkhoff normal form is integrable and nondegenerate. This means that the KAM theorem can indeed be applied. The problem is of course that their required nonresonance condition is <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> <b>met.</b> This leaves a large gap in the proofs. The new idea in this thesis is to incorporate the discrete symmetries of the lattice in the argument. It turns out that this enables us to show that the nonresonance condition of Nishida and Sanders is not needed: every resonance is overruled by a symmetry. Hence the Birkhoff normal form is integrable and this proves the applicability of the KAM theorem. Moreover, much attention is paid to the analysis of exact and approximate solutions of the lattice equations. New exact solutions and invariant manifolds are found in the fixed point sets of the symmetries of the lattice. Also, the Birkhoff normal reveals approximate integrals and solutions in the low energy domain of the phase space. The analysis makes use of invariant theory and singular reduction. One of the conclusions is that the lattice with an even number of particles contains travelling wave solutions that change their direction. Moreover the integrable normal form contains nontrivial monodromy, meaning that it does not allow global action-angle variable...|$|E
