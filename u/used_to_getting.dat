At the church, Vanessa waits outside for Sonya and her son, Callum (Morgan Baker), who is giving his mother away. Inside, Toadie talks to the guests, then goes over to sit with Lucas and claims that he should be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> married by now. The {{ceremony}} begins and Sonya and Toadie recite their vows. They exchange rings and are pronounced husband and wife. Everyone poses for photos and they head to Lassiter's for the reception. At the same time, Mason Turner (Taylor Glockner) and Robbo Slade (Aaron Jakubenko) are finalising plans to rob the hotel. At Lassiter's, Sonya struggles to find a signal on her phone and decides to walk around the corner. She finds two men with balaclavas on and overhears them mention the hotel has laid on extra security for a wedding. Robbo takes his balaclava off and notices Sonya when her phone rings again. Sonya notices the other man's distinctive belt buckle, before they run off.|$|E

Roebuck's role parallels that of Martin Rohde (played by Kim Bodnia), the Danish detective in The Bridge. Karl and Martin share some characteristics, but also differ in certain ways; for instance, Karl is [...] "more educated and a more troubled man". Dillane {{was drawn to the}} political questions raised in the storyline, as well as the series' [...] "novelistic telling".|$|E

500|$|Malone {{originally}} scripted Todd as {{a serial}} rapist. As {{part of the}} 1993 rape storyline, it was disclosed that Todd raped a woman named Carol Swift, {{a year or two}} before raping Marty, and that there were hints he raped other young women before Carol. Howarth considered Todd's rationale for raping Marty to be complex. [...] "Todd was in love with Marty," [...] he said. When Marty rejects Todd's romantic advances after their one-night stand, it is because he was cold to her that same night after they had sex. Marty's rejection upsets Todd and it festers. When he fails an exam after she tutors him, he blames her for the failure and begins attributing her as the reason for his problems. Howarth called Todd [...] "privileged and very rich". Because Todd was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> what he wanted, {{he did not know how}} to cope with Marty rejecting him.|$|E

I've been there {{and it seems like}} a little pro-Nazi Republic to me." [...] Bankhead, who loathed both Nazism and Communism, was outraged and thought Hellman a moral hypocrite. Hellman had never been to Finland, and Bankhead, as did the rest of the cast, suspected she refused the benefit due to a fanatical devotion to Soviet Russia. As a result of the feud, Hellman, who did not like being questioned and was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> her way, and Bankhead, who was always outspoken and hated being crossed when she knew she was morally right, became enemies.|$|E

2500|$|Debnam-Carey said {{figuring}} out how to portray all these aspects of the character was the most challenging part. [...] "For me, it was about finding that mix between vulnerability and tension and a wiseness beyond her years," [...] she said. A director advised her that less is more, and she adapted to the character, and learned more about her, via portrayal. [...] "I realized that I was slowly developing all of these things. Someone was like, 'Is it a thing you've chosen to do, to not blink all the time?' I was like, 'Wow!' When it comes to Lexa, she's very steely-gazed, all the time. There's a presence about her and a knowingness, and she's always observant." [...] By making calculated choices, she is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> what she wants.|$|E
2500|$|In the book, five {{distinct}} [...] "mono-dialogues", a term Loevy himself used {{in personal}} correspondence, {{are used to}} tell the story of the family to an assumed listening partner, who is neither seen nor heard. Each of these mono-dialogues is different, and given by different people in different languages or period-appropriate forms of Hebrew. Loevy captured this in the film, creating a new television vocabulary. The [...] "mono-dialogue" [...] technique eliminated the [...] "fourth wall" [...] taboo of television and film, according to which the audience absolves itself of traditional neutrality and assumes the role of a character in the story. In Loevy's own words, [...] "Television demands text, but the television viewer is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> the complete text. Every question has an answer...." [...] In Mr. Mani, the role of respondent is filled by the camera and, by extension, the audience itself. [...] "As soon as the speaker turns to the camera—in other words, to the audience, speaking directly to it in a way that demands an answer, it is as if the speaker stepped out of the screen, almost like in Woody Allen's The Purple Rose of Cairo. The viewer is shaken up. The artificial nature of the situation itself in Mr. Mani screams its presence.". Like the characters in Luigi Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author, the characters cease being the subjects of scrutiny by some external viewer. The external viewer, i.e., the audience, becomes a partner in dialogue with the actors and an active participant in the story.|$|E
2500|$|Derek is {{described}} by Inside Soap as [...] "a man who doesn't {{take no for an}} answer", [...] "dangerous and edgy" [...] and [...] "the exact opposite of poor Alfie." [...] The magazine said that if Derek chose to have an affair with Kat, he could end up back in prison if Alfie found out and would be taken away from his daughter Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks). They later said that Derek had previously declared that he and Kat were [...] "two peas in a pod", which would [...] "make her very appealing to an egotist like Derek!" [...] They said that [...] "sparks would fly if Derek and Kat hooked up. He's got that dangerous edge that [...] Kat loves, but Alfie lacks! And we all know that Derek's a man who's <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> what he wants—every time..." [...] Soaplife said that Derek is part of every other storyline and actor Foreman's contract was extended, so the chances of it being Derek are high, but they did not want it to be Derek. However, they later said they thought it would be Derek, as love is not Kat's motivation (ruling out Jack), and Derek {{is the only one who}} would not be cheating on a partner, saying the others [...] "would have to cheat on their other half [...] for no better reason than Kat has to cheat on Alfie (ie. none). And that would be too far-fetched." [...] They said Derek would probably enjoy the danger of being caught out by Alfie, and continued to rule out the other suspects, maintaining that they have seen nothing to change their minds that it is Derek. All About Soap wondered if Derek would have the time and inclination to woo Kat as he is struggling to bond with his children Alice and Joey Branning (David Witts), and opined that he would, and the fact that [...] "he's just the wrong side of dodgy, [...] right up Kat's street. Walford's creepiest couple could be on the cards!" [...] They made him their joint third favourite for the affair, along with Ray, and later said that an affair between Kat and Derek would be [...] "very believable" [...] but [...] "more than a little bit gross", noting that Derek is on a power trip and Kat loves to be dominated and as there is more to the affair than physical attraction, there would be a [...] "strong chance" [...] it would be Derek. Julie Emery of Heat said of the affair, [...] "Our money's on Derek. What a couple they'd make..." ...|$|E

60|$|Joan {{attended}} the King's mass the next day, and afterward dined with the King and the Duke. The King {{was learning to}} prize her company and value her conversation; and that might well be, for, like other kings, he was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> nothing out of people's talk but guarded phrases, colorless and non-committal, or carefully tinted to tally with the color {{of what he said}} himself; and so this kind of conversation only vexes and bores, and is wearisome; but Joan's talk was fresh and free, sincere and honest, and unmarred by timorous self-watching and constraint. She said the very thing that was in her mind, and said it in a plain, straightforward way. One can believe that to the King this must have been like fresh cold water from the mountains to parched lips used to the water of the sun-baked puddles of the plain.|$|E
60|$|At {{one time}} there seemed a {{probability}} of the {{enlargement of the}} author's gains by subscription publication, and one very well-known American author prospered fabulously in that way. The percentage offered by the subscription houses was only about {{half as much as}} that paid by the trade, but the sales were so much greater that the author could very well afford to take it. Where the book-dealer sold ten, the book-agent sold a hundred; or at least he did so in the case of Mark Twain's books; and we all thought it reasonable he could do so with ours. Such of us as made experiment of him, however, found the facts illogical. No book of literary quality was made to go by subscription except Mr. Clemens's books, and I think these went because the subscription public never knew what good literature they were. This sort of readers, or buyers, were so <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> something worthless for their money that they would not spend it for artistic fiction, or, indeed, for any fiction at all except Mr. Clemens's, which they probably supposed bad. Some good books of travel had a measurable success through the book-agents, but not at all the success that had been hoped for; and I believe now the subscription trade again publishes only compilations, or such works as owe more to the skill of the editor than the art of the writer. Mr. Clemens himself no longer offers his books to the public in that way.|$|E
60|$|Marcia had {{consented to}} go down to Equity alone, that summer, for he had {{convinced}} her that during a heated political contest it would not do for him to be away from the paper. He promised {{to go down}} for her when she wished to come home; and it was easily arranged for her to travel as far as the Junction under Halleck's escort, when he went to join his sisters in the White Mountains. Bartley missed her and the baby at first. But he soon began to adjust himself with resignation to his solitude. They had determined to keep their maid over this summer, for they had so much trouble in replacing her the last time after their return; and Bartley said he should live very economically. It was quiet, and the woman kept the house cool and clean; she was a good cook, and when Bartley brought a man home to dinner she took an interest in serving it well. Bartley let her order the things from the grocer and butcher, for she knew what they were <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>getting,</b> and he had heard so much talk from Marcia about bills since he bought that Events stock that he was sick of the prices of things. There was no extravagance, and vet he seemed to live very much better after Marcia went. There is no doubt but he lived very much more at his ease. One little restriction after another fell away from him; he went and came with absolute freedom, not only without having to account for his movements, but without having a pang for not doing so. He had the sensation of stretching himself after a cramping posture; and he wrote Marcia the cheerfulest letters, charging her not to cut short her visit from anxiety on his account. He said that he was working hard, but hard work evidently agreed with him, for he was never better in his life. In this high content he maintained a feeling of loyalty by going to the Hallecks, where Mrs. Halleck often had him to tea in pity of his loneliness. They were dull company, certainly; but Marcia liked them, and the cooking was always good. Other evenings he went to the theatres, where there were amusing variety bills; and sometimes he passed the night at Nantasket, or took a run for a day to Newport; he always reported these excursions to Marcia, with expressions of regret that Equity was too far away to run down to for a day.|$|E
