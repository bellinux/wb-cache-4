5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E
500|$|Another {{song that}} {{generated}} controversy was Saint and Sinner where Webb wrote [...] "I {{used to be}} a damned mess but now I look just fine, 'Cause you dressed me <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> drank the finest wine". The word 'damned' was removed from {{the final version of the}} album, at the request of two major Christian retailers.|$|E
500|$|Discussing May's {{sickness}} in {{the episode}} after being [...] "infected" [...] by the ghost Lucy {{in the season}} premiere, Wen explained that [...] "It starts to affect May’s perception of things. It’s almost like being on LSD, but worse. It’s not good. You never want May out of control. You don’t {{want her to be}} paranoid." [...] Regarding Reyes' choice to work with Johnson {{at the end of the}} episode, Luna said that [...] "a lot of that is I respect her power and I respect her. I understand that she’s going in the same direction I am, she’s seeking the same ends that I am, so I offer the opportunity for her to jump in and saddle <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> go find these things out." ...|$|E

50|$|In the meantime, Wes keeps Elena in the {{basement}} of her father's old medical practice. She wakes <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wes</b> informs her about her father's experiments and Elena stars having some memories of her as a little girl (Kayla Madison) with her father (Jason MacDonald). Despite the tortures she remembers that her father was doing all these to help people, for example to use the vampire blood as a cure to many diseases.|$|R
50|$|The {{second part}} of the season focuses on Wes' {{investigation}} of his mother's suicide 10 years ago; flashbacks reveal Annalise's involvement with Wes' mother's suicide. The season ends with Annalise's finding out that Frank was responsible for the car crash that killed her baby, and Annalise sends him away. Michaela <b>and</b> Asher hook <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wes</b> meets with his biological father right before the latter is shot dead by an unknown shooter.|$|R
500|$|... "Jon Bernthal is a {{tremendous}} talent and he’s {{got a lot of}} professionalism. A lot of the actors came in to the room as we were starting this season and Bernthal was one of those actors. He was aware {{of a lot of the}} things that were coming <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> talked to him about his character and what we had planned for him this season and he was on board with a lot of it. It was nice being able to run though scenarios with him and get his opinion on how he perceived his character. Because actors, a lot of times, think about their characters more than the writers because they’re focused on that single character for months of their lives, if not years. He was all prepared for this." ...|$|E
500|$|Interviewed in January 2006, Chambers foreshadowed major {{developments}} for his character when he stated: [...] "I think Sam's ideal woman might be Connie because she's feisty, doesn't beat around {{the bush and}} is very talented, which is always sexy. However I reckon they clash quite a lot because she manipulates with her power play and won't drop the act {{so it would be}} very much on a love hate basis." [...] The two characters went on to have a brief sexual relationship, resulting in Connie becoming pregnant with Sam's child. Once the revelation of Connie's pregnancy had been made, Chambers asserted of the tension between the separated couple: [...] "Some of the scenes with Connie work amazingly well because we do genuinely get worked <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> like {{to keep it that way}} until filming is finished. It's a useful tip to let the frustrations come through in your work - it makes good viewing." ...|$|E
500|$|Outhwaite {{had long}} {{been a fan of}} Inside No. 9 and the work of Pemberton and Shearsmith, the former of whom she had worked with in an episode of Hotel Babylon. She was {{particularly}} pleased to appear alongside Hadland, as the pair are old friends, and characterised her duet with Hadland as her favourite scene. Outhwaite, like some of the other performers, expressed her enjoyment of the fancy dress aspect of the episode, and she loved her [...] "selfish, sad and manipulative" [...] character, Connie. The filming process was, for her, extremely enjoyable and memorable. Pemberton said that Hadland and Outhwaite [...] "brought a bubbly energy which injected into the hysteria of that room", naming the episode's production his favourite filming experience from the series. Shearsmith pointed to the scene in which [...] "a hen party invades the karaoke room and they start singing. The music was pumped <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> had a mini party, with mad dancing – that was a memorable scene to film." ...|$|E

500|$|Executive {{producer}} Maurissa Tancharoen {{stated the}} production team was not ruling out creating crossover episodes with Agent Carter or Guardians of the Galaxy during the season, with executive producer Jed Whedon adding {{that any such}} episodes would not equal the scale seen in the [...] crossover from the first season, saying, [...] "In terms of game-changers, [...] hard to beat." [...] Bell later said [...] "is coming <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> know what's going on with that {{and look forward to}} seeing it, but it's pretty cool to find ways to tie-in stuff and connect things." [...] In December 2014, ABC confirmed the series would tie-in with Avengers: Age of Ultron, with Whedon saying, [...] "You should expect something. The Avengers is the big tent that all the franchises play under. Obviously, we're included in that." [...] The episodes [...] "The Frenemy of My Enemy" [...] and [...] "The Dirty Half Dozen" [...] feature [...] "Easter eggs, plot threads and other connective tissue leading into the opening scene of Avengers: Age of Ultron" [...] while [...] "Scars" [...] explores the aftermath of the film.|$|E
500|$|Actor Gabriel Luna {{said that}} Robbie Reyes chose {{to work with}} Daisy Johnson after the last episode because [...] "I respect her power and I respect her. I {{understand}} that she’s going {{in the same direction}} I am, she’s seeking the same ends that I am, so I offer the opportunity for her to jump in and saddle <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> go find these things out." [...] He noted that they [...] "get sidetracked" [...] with the blackouts in this episode, and then Gabe asks Johnson to leave. Luna said [...] "that look on his face you see is perhaps a little disappointment in that he started to have a bond with someone he hasn’t killed. I think that face you see is one of—not fear, but definitely concern that the one person who knows that Robbie Reyes is Ghost Rider is now back out there running around, doing whatever she has to do." [...] Whedon called Gabe asking Johnson to leave Robbie [...] "another blow to Daisy and her emotional makeup" [...] as she [...] "has been trying to operate alone, because she doesn’t want to be a danger to anyone else. Now ... Gabe voices her very fear".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{remaining}} unenthusiastic {{with the}} script, Kanter agreed to commission it {{as a film}} {{on the condition that}} he reserve the right to select a [...] "" [...] director. Anderson would have selected David Lane, who had directed the two Thunderbirds film sequels, Thunderbirds Are Go (1966) and Thunderbird 6 (1968). After a ten-week delay to filming, Robert Parrish, an American director whose latest project had been shelved, accepted the post. Parrish's film career up to 1968 had included co-editing Body and Soul (for which he had shared the 1947 Academy Award for Best Film Editing) and co-directing the 1967 James Bond spoof, Casino Royale. Anderson remembered Parrish as being [...] "very ingratiating", stating that he [...] "told us he loved the script and said it would be an honour to work with us. Jay Kanter gave Bob the thumbs <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> were in business." [...] Although the box office failure of Casino Royale had prompted Anderson to question Parrish's ability, he stated that Doppelgänger could not have been made without his recruitment: [...] "It wasn't a question of, 'Will we get on with him?' or, 'Is he the right man?' He was a name director, so we signed him up immediately." ...|$|E

500|$|Several {{breaking}} {{practitioners and}} pioneers tend {{to side with}} the camp that does not believe breaking came from capoeira. B-boy Crazy Legs states: [...] "We didn't know what the f-ck no capoeira was, man. We were in the ghetto!" [...] According to Pabon, [...] "Unlike the popularity of the martial arts films, capoeira was not seen in the Bronx jams until the 1990s. Top rockin' seems to have developed gradually and unintentionally, leaving space for growth and new additions, until it evolved into a codified form." [...] B-boy crew Spartanic Rockers adds: [...] "Despite of [...] many rumours and opinions Breaking didn't originate from Capoeira but during the last few years many moves, steps and freezes of this Brazilian (fight-) dance have inspired more and more B-Girls and B-Boys who integrated them into their dance." [...] B-boy Ken Swift was breaking long before he saw capoeria: [...] "In '78 I started [...] and I didn't see it [...] til '92 ... I was around, too—I was in Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, I went around and I didn't see it. What we saw was Kung Fu—we saw Kung Fu from the 42nd Street theaters. So those were our inspirations... when we did the Kung Fu sh-t we switched it <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> put this B-boy flavor into it..." ...|$|E
500|$|Culturally, the album's {{glorification of}} teenage freedom {{made a very}} big impact on the overall Britpop music scene. The whole genre {{was seen as the}} voice of youth, but Supergrass, still teens {{themselves}} when the album was made, addressed the subject with more insight than most. The most well-known song from the album, [...] "Alright", is still played regularly in Britain and Ireland, and held up as a musical example of teenage rebellion. Though it is one of their most popular songs, the band rarely play [...] "Alright" [...] in their live sets any more. In a 1999 interview, Gaz Coombes joked, [...] "We don't play 'Alright' anymore. We should play it in a minor key, and in the past tense." [...] Around the time of its release Coombes said that [...] "it wasn't written as an anthem. It isn't supposed to be a rally cry for our generation. The stuff about We are young/We run green... isn't about being 19 but really 13 or 14 and just discovering girls and drinking. It's meant to be light-hearted and a bit of a laugh, not at all a rebellious call to arms." [...] Danny Goffey noted, [...] "It certainly wasn't written in a very summery vibe. It was written in a cottage where the heating had packed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> were trying to build fires to keep warm." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "In the Dark" [...] was {{directed}} by Ethan Lader. Dev enlisted Lader to make the video as he regularly makes videos for her and The Cataracs. Lader originally contacted her with ideas for the clip, and she soon replied with what she would want in the video. She said, [...] "So we did that back and forth, which he always does with me until I get my point across. ... and then we met <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> got both of our ideas and feelings across. I wanted to be sexy and dark like the song is, in a really interesting way, and we pulled it off, I think." [...] The video was filmed in Los Angeles, California in late-April 2011, just before Dev joined Usher as the opening act for his OMG Tour. Dev took {{more control over the}} [...] "In the Dark" [...] video than previous video shoots as she used to let the director [...] "take a little bit of control" [...] when she was inexperienced in the process. In an interview with Idolator, Dev elaborated on the video's concept, stating that she wanted a dark feel similar to Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland: [...] "I wanted the video to be sexy as well. I wanted it to reflect all the dark aspects of the song, and initially we went in thinking that we'd have an Alice in Wonderland/Tim Burton type of feel." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{second part}} of the season focuses on Wes' {{investigation}} around his mother's suicide ten years ago, and it is revealed from flashbacks how involved Annalise was with Wes' mother's suicide.

Michaela <b>and</b> Asher hook <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wes</b> meets <b>up</b> with his biological father right before his father is shot dead by an unknown shooter.|$|R
500|$|Like Ice-T's {{gangsta rap}} albums, Body Counts {{material}} focused on various {{social and political}} issues, with songs focusing on topics ranging from police brutality to drug abuse. According to Ernie C, [...] "Everybody writes about whatever they learned growing <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> were no exception. Like The Beach Boys sing about the beach, we sing {{about the way we}} grew up." [...] Ice-T states that [...] "Body Count was an angry record. It {{was meant to be a}} protest record. I put my anger in it, while lacing it with dark humor." [...] The spoken introduction, [...] "Smoked Pork" [...] features Ice-T taking on the roles of a gangster pretending to be seemingly stranded motorist and a police officer who refuses to aid. The track begins with Mooseman and Ice-T driving their car towards a police car, and then Ice-T asks for the gun Mooseman has and tells Mooseman to stay in the car, much to Mooseman's chagrin, as Mooseman wanted to kill the cop in this round. Ice-T then walks up to the policeman, pretending to be a stranded motorist, asking for help, but the policeman refuses, saying: [...] "Nah, that's not my job! My job's not to help your fuckin' ass out!", then telling him that [...] "my job is eatin' these doughnuts". When the officer recognizes Ice-T, gunshots are heard. The final voice on the track is Ice-T confirming his identity.|$|E
500|$|Lennon {{later said}} he [...] "couldn't {{remember}} any of the words but it didn't matter—I just made them all <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> made a great wonderful noise." [...] Carl Perkins said to Lennon after the {{show that he was}} [...] "so beautiful you made me cry." [...] A bootleg album of the concert appeared, under the title JL-YO-EC, thanks to an audience recording, which was released {{a few months after the}} official album. After Lennon's death, the album, along with seven other Lennon albums, was reissued by EMI as part of a box set, which was released in the UK on 15 June 1981. The album was reissued in the US in 1982, on Capitol, and again in the same country on the same label, in 1986. The album was originally scheduled to appear on CD for the first time in June 1989, but the plan was scrapped. Ono, with the help of Rob Stevens from Quad Recording, supervised a remixing of Live Peace in Toronto 1969 for its compact disc issue, released on 1 May 1995. Two of the remixed tracks feature a variation in Ono's vocals: while [...] "Dizzy Miss Lizzy" [...] has additional backing vocals from Ono, [...] "Money" [...] has fewer backing vocals from Ono. The CD booklet included a 1995 calendar, mimicking the original release. The album is also available from the audiophile label Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab., utilizing the same remix. The booklet for the 2006 Mobile Fidelity release also included a current calendar.|$|E
500|$|On July 11, 1886, {{a meeting}} {{was held at}} the home of P.N. Clausen at which the Danebod {{congregation}} was formally organized with fifteen members. The church council consisted of its president, P.N. Clausen, secretary M.Lauritsen, and treasurer Jørgen Jacobsen. At first there were no regular church services and no resident pastor. Instead, the people met in various homes to sing Danish hymns and listen to a reading of the sermon by a layman. The pastor of Sleepy Eye, Minnesota, S.C. Madsen, and other ministers occasionally conducted services in town. The congregation later hired the Danish settler, pastor Hans Jørgen Pedersen (1851–1905) of Gowen, Michigan. He arrived with his family on April12, 1888. Pedersen had a humble upbringing in Denmark, where he later studied at Ryslinge Folk High School before emigrating to America in 1875. He was an eloquent preacher, resourceful, and became involved in community activities throughout the area. He quickly assumed leadership and thus, in a sense, became the founder of Danebod. One of the pastor's six children, Sigurd Pedersen, described their first arrival in Danebod in his autobiography: [...] "It was a chilly morning, when the committee stood on the platform to bid welcome to the new pastor and his wife, trailed by six children, and the rear held up by the trusty hired man, Søren Olsen, who was to keep count of the straying flock and see that the last luggage was not forgotten. Friends invited us over for breakfast in the home of H.J. Nelsen, the merchant. Then the committee guided us to a small house on the corner just west of the present-day Chevrolet dealer, where businessman Carl Cold Sorensen brought the first automobiles to the area in the early 1900's. The committee had left no kindling in this small house, but Søren Olsen soon discovered that the kitchen range was in place and claimed to be able to manipulate the same if kindling could be provided. Across the street was a large general store, and father sent us there to beg Mr.Lauritsen for some kindling. We were given old boxes to break <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> soon had our arms full and Søren had a blazing fire in a few minutes." [...] In September 1888, it was decided at a convention in Elk Horn, Iowa, to give the congregation at Danebod [...] of land, and the Danebod Lutheran Church was dedicated on Sunday, June16, 1895. Pedersen died in 1905, and the Reverend Thorvald Knudsen succeeded him at Danebod.|$|E
