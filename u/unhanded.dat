60|$|As soon as Catriona came {{a little}} to herself she <b>unhanded</b> me {{suddenly}} but said no word. No more did I; and indeed the whistling {{of the wind and}} the breaching of the sprays made it no time for speech; and our crew not only toiled excessively but made extremely little way, so that the Rose had got her anchor and was off again before we had approached the harbour mouth.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps it is {{tell-tale}} {{to divulge}} {{that for a}} moment Hook entranced her, and we tell on her only because her slip led to strange results. Had she haughtily <b>unhanded</b> him (and we should have loved to write it of her), she would have been hurled through the air like the others, and then Hook would probably not have been present at the tying of the children; and had he not been at the tying he would not have discovered Slightly's secret, and without the secret he could not presently have made his foul attempt on Peter's life.|$|E
60|$|Who shall {{tell all}} the {{thoughts}} and feelings of Pierre in that desolate and shivering room, when at last the idea obtruded, that the wiser and the profounder he should grow, the more and the more he lessened the chances for bread; that could he now hurl his deep book out of the window, and fall to on some shallow nothing of a novel, composable in a month at the longest, then could he reasonably hope for both appreciation and cash. But the devouring profundities, now opened up in him, consume all his vigor; would he, he could not now be entertainingly and profitably shallow in some pellucid and merry romance. Now he sees, that with every accession of the personal divine to him, some great land-slide of the general surrounding divineness slips from him, and falls crashing away. Said I not that the gods, as well as mankind, had <b>unhanded</b> themselves from this Pierre? So now in him you behold the baby toddler I spoke of; forced now to stand and toddle alone.|$|E
5000|$|The moniker [...] "Mrs Brown", {{used both}} {{at the time and}} in the film, implied an improper, and perhaps sexual, relationship. The film does not {{directly}} address the contemporary suspicions that the Queen and Brown had had a sexual relationship and perhaps had even secretly married (see the article on Brown), though cartoons from the satirical magazine Punch are shown as being passed around in Parliament (only one of the cartoons is revealed to the camera, showing an empty throne, with the sceptre lying <b>unhanded</b> across it).|$|E
40|$|Provisions of {{the study}} were set forth in an {{instruction}} sheet. After evaluation of the samples, each family returned a report card that indicated their preferences, cooking method, and reasons for preference. Significantly more participants (about 7 percent) chose the fresh samples over the frozen. However, examination of preference combinations for all three replications in-dicated that this difference could have been due to the method of identifying samples (banded or <b>unhanded)</b> rather than to the treatment the sample had received. Most families gave "Taste and Tender-ness " as the reason for choice. Cooking method had no significant effect on the rea-sons for choice. As in previous reports, consumers ex-pressed reluctance to purchase frozen chicken. However, 63. 4 percent froze chicken at home even if they expected to cook it within 1 or 2 days...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} demonstrated {{a number of}} changes in the anterior lobe proopiomelanocortin (POMC) system in chronically stressed rats. The purpose of the present experiments was to investigate whether chronically stressed rats demonstrate changes in pituitary sensitivity to glucocorticoid negative feedback. To study this question we compared the effects of ghicoeorticoids on ovine corticotropin releasing factor (oCRF) -stimulated ACTH and 13 -endorphin release from cell suspensions prepared from naive <b>unhanded</b> rats versus chronically stressed rats. After dexamethasone, there was a 50 % decrease in oCRF-stimulated hormone release in control rats but no inhibition of oCRF-stimulated hormone release in anterior lobe suspension from chronically stressed rats. Rather, the chronically stressed group exhibited a 50 % hormone increase above the oCRF-stimulated baseline. The same pattern was observed after the addition of corticosterone to the medium. These findings suggest {{that there may be a}} positive feedback effect of glueocorticoids at the pituitary level under some conditions of chronic stress...|$|E
40|$|Now a day’s many {{organizations}} {{are required to}} communicate online on a daily basis, 24 -hour, seven-days-a-week, to gain the desired competitive advantages and profits; although {{there are a variety}} of disruptions that may occur within business application such as broken (off-line) database-links and <b>unhanded</b> database exceptions. Such cases will end the automated business work, and force business users to continue business procedures and functionalities via paper work, which causes additional resources with less business competitive advantages. In this paper, we will propose a new model in which we embed short message services (SMS) within business applications using the SMS Gateway such as "Ozeki Message Server", and programmed application packages. By using our proposed model, we can maintain business continuity when a partial disruption occurs and then switch to our application model. As a result to the experimental work, we conclude that our model supports business continuity since it supports the account balance modification while the database link is disrupted. In addition, we carried out each step twice and the scenario was reliable since all of its steps were reliable...|$|E
40|$|The {{major problem}} {{of this study}} is how the major {{character}} escapes from the anxiety, resulted from <b>unhanded</b> problems she encounters. The aim {{of this study is}} to identify the relation between the causes of anxiety and the ways to escape from structural and psychoanalytic analysis. In so doing, the study focuses on the major character, namely Louisa. The benefit of the study is to give some contributions in the application of psychological approach in literary study and to fulfill the requirement for getting bachelor degree in English Department. The study uses library data, the primary data is taken from the novel it self, while the secondary data is taken from some criticism and information needed. The method of data collection is descriptive and hermeneutics. The study employs sigmoid Freud’s psychoanalysis to answer the problem. The outcome of the study shows that there is a close relationship between a work of literature and psychological phenomena. The psychological analyses, specifically psychoanalytic conclude that anxiety occurs as a result of a strained relation among the elements of personality system, namely id, ego and superego. Based on Sigmund Freud’s theory, the anxiety experienced by Lou isa as the major character in this novel is categorized into moral anxiet...|$|E
40|$|The third {{study was}} {{performed}} in seven printing work-era after a colleague had developed aplastic anemia. All cytogenetic studies were completely normal, al-though evidence of bone marrow damage was noted, presumably {{as a result of}} exposure to a variety of organic compounds (9). Review of studies in nonleu-kemic subjects (7, 10 - 17) reveal one of 50 patients studied with banding techniques and zero of 263 pa-tients with <b>unhanded</b> studies to have evidence of a clonal abnormality. These data are insufficient to permit any assessment of point 4 above, but they are consistent with the causal hypothesis. The issue of whether particular abnormalities are caused by specific agents has been raised (3, 4). If there is a strict one-to-one relation, then strong asso-ciations could be detected using case-control study designs. On the other hand, if an abnormality such as plus chromosome 8 can be caused by a variety of exposures or if the same exposure can cause several different abnormalities, the associations would be weak and difficult to detect. Preliminary data from several sources (18 - 20) have suggested that loss of all or part of chromosomes 5 and/or 7 is associated with environmental exposures or prior cytotoxic therapy in acute nonlymphocytic patients, but information on more patients will be required to evaluate these rela-tions. Unfortunately, unless other etiologic agents are identified for leukemia, a test of the one exposure-one abnormality hypothesis will be difficult. We believe that these issues can be examined by carefully designed studies of exposed populations. As noted by Sandier and Collman, other laboratory assayB which correlate with marrow chromosome damage such as sister chromatid exchanges or chromosome breaks in lymphocytes would facilitate such studies. Further refinements would include careful exposure histories supplemented by biologic markers or other indicators of exposure. The authors should be congratulated for a stimu-lating and thought-provoking review...|$|E
40|$|Large arches {{and columns}} are seen {{surrounding}} a flat field. In the foreground of the field, some American Indians on horseback ride toward the camera. The Indians are wearing feathers, war paint, and are carrying frontier rifles across the bare backs of their horses. In {{the middle of}} this flat area, men dressed as U. S. Army troops in battle regalia are lined up in the position of skirmishers. They fire at the Indians, who gallop by. The troops move over this flat area while the Indians on horseback circle them. From a contemporary Edison film company catalog: SHAM BATTLE AT THE PAN-AMERICAN EXPOSITION. Unhamento. [code for telegraphic orders] On the closing day of the Pan-American Exposition, Saturday, November 2 nd, 1901, a sham battle took place at the Stadium on the Pan-American Exhibition grounds, between the six tribes of American Indians and the United States Infantry stationed at Buffalo. The battle was most exciting and realistic, there being about 250 American Indians clad in their picturesque dress and fully decorated in their war paint. About half the Indians were mounted upon spirited horses. The attack was begun by the Infantry rushing the Indians who made a firm stand and succeeded in repulsing the soldiers. The scene is replete with charges and many hand to hand encounters. Most of the action took place close to our camera and the picture which we secured is excellent. The scene opens with a parade of the American Indians, which in itself is of great interest, the parade portion of the film consuming about 25 feet. Class B 275 ft. $ 33. 00.
