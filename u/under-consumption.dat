50|$|Second, once a {{recession}} has occurred (e.g., 1931-33), private investment can be blocked by debt, unused capacity, pessimistic expectations, and increasing social unrest. In this case, capitalists {{try to raise}} their rates of profit by cutting wages and raising labor productivity (by speeding up production). The problem is that while this may be rational for the individual, it is irrational for the capitalist class as a whole. Cutting wages relative to productivity lowers consumer demand relative to potential output. With other sources of aggregate demand blocked, this actually hurts profitability by lowering demand.

Hobson, a British liberal {{writing at}} the time of the fierce debate {{concerning}} imperialism during the Second Boer War, observed the spectacle of the [...] "Scramble for Africa" [...] and emphasized changes in European social structures and attitudes as well as capital flow, though his emphasis on the latter seems to have been the most influential and provocative. His so-called accumulation theory, very influential in its day, suggested that capitalism suffered from <b>under-consumption</b> due to the rise of monopoly capitalism and the resultant concentration of wealth in fewer hands, which he argued gave rise to a misdistribution of purchasing power. His thesis called attention to Europe's huge, impoverished industrial working class, which was typically far too poor to consume goods produced by an industrialized economy. His analysis of capital flight and the rise of mammoth cartels later influenced Vladimir Lenin in his book Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalismhttp://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/index.htm, which has become a basis for the neo-Marxist analysis of imperialism.|$|E

40|$|A {{key feature}} of {{physical}} activity is that it results in an increased rate of energy expenditure and, {{as a result of}} metabolic inefficiencies that lead to high heat production, an increase in the requirement to dissipate the added heat through sweat.   Nevertheless, surveys commonly find that athletes fail to optimally satisfy both energy and fluid needs, causing them to perform at levels below their conditioned capacities.   To some extent this problem results from an excess reliance on the sensations of ‘hunger’ and ‘thirst’ to guide energy and fluid intakes, but there are also common misunderstandings of the best eating strategies for achieving optimal body composition and performance.   The need to improve the strength-to-weight ratio to enable an enhanced ability to overcome sport-related resistance can be misinterpreted as a need to be ‘small’, which may result in an <b>under-consumption</b> of energy through restrained eating and special ‘diets’.   The outcome, however, is nearly always the precise opposite of the desired effect, with lower strength-to-weight ratios that result in an ever-increasing downward spiral in energy and fluid consumption.   This paper focuses on within-day energy balance eating and drinking strategies that are now successfully followed by many elite-level athletes.   These strategies can help athletes avoid the common errors of <b>under-consumption</b> while simultaneously improving both body composition and performance. </p...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedWe calculated {{the value of}} two distinct economic inefficiencies that result from the prohibition of drugs. We define and illustrate these inefficiencies as the two direct components of the deadweight loss created by prohibition. The first is <b>under-consumption</b> and the second component, unique to our analysis, is the payment for risk. Using the 1999 illegal quantities and prices, the derived legal prices, and the estimated demand elasticities for four illegal drugs, we calculated the estimated quantity demanded for these drugs in legal markets. We then used {{the results of these}} calculations and estimated the total deadweight loss of the drug war in 1999 to be over $ 90 billion-$ 65 billion in payment for risk and $ 24 billion in <b>under-consumption.</b> We then focus our analysis on the indirect components of the deadweight loss, e. g., costs to reduce supply, cost of incarceration, and productivity losses, etc. Our conservative estimate for indirect deadweight loss for 1999 was $ 96. 1 billion. In the final chapter, we estimate that of the total deadweight loss, America could gain $ 6. 7 billion annually in taxes from legal drug sales, save over $ 34 billion annually in drug war costs, and recoup the remainder via reductions in prohibition-related phenomena.

40|$|European {{countries}} are economically dependent upon each other. This paper therefore embeds {{the analysis of}} the Western Balkan countries within a wider perspective of the European economy as a whole. It combines a simple core-periphery model with an <b>under-consumption</b> model to provide an explanation of the emergence of secular stagnation, the dependency relationships between the core and peripheries of the European economy, and the spillover effects of Eurozone crisis to the Western Balkans. Due to tendencies to <b>under-consumption,</b> the core countries have been vulnerable to secular stagnation. In order to overcome this tendency within the Eurozone they are dependent on export revenues from the peripheries to sustain their economic growth. This has led to high trade and current account deficits during the boom and placed the peripheries in a highly vulnerable position during the recession period. Financialisation of the European economy has emerged {{as a response to the}} tendency towards secular stagnation, as the provision of consumer credit stimulated demand and temporarily overcame under consumption tendencies. The paper argues that continuing austerity, as a method to create internal devaluation, is unlikely to succeed as a means to extricate the periphery countries from the crisis. Given the dependencies of the European economies upon one another, a possibly better way out of the current period of low growth and stagnation would be a coordinated fiscal expansion to stimulate domestic and Europe-wide demand...|$|E

The optimal waiting time is higher for treatments with demands more elastic to waiting time, higher costs, lower charges, smaller marginal welfare loss from waiting by treated patients, and smaller marginal welfare losses from <b>under-consumption</b> of care. The results hold for a wide range of welfarist and non-welfarist objective functions and for systems in which there is also a private health care sector.

The author intends {{to publish a}} paper, which gives a foundation of this paradox of thrift by connecting money circulation analysis and welfare economics in the case where saving is limited to hoarding. As an introduction of the intended paper, this paper provides a simple explanation for hoarding loss using some graphs. Under certain conditions, the representative agent hoards {{money in order to}} increase utility, but the hoarding actually decreases it against agent’s rational intention. This irrationality of rationality occurs because the agent maximizes their utility while lowering the budget of the entire relevant term. This conclusion is derived from the agent making the decision with an ignorance of the whole expenditure reflux. Since the interest of a selfish agent is limited to their private range, the agent ignores the reflux despite of its objective truthfulness. Keywords.
