He <b>used</b> <b>a</b> pair of Sony MDR-7506 headphones as a studio monitor {{in order not to}} wake up his roommate. It was subsequently mastered by Brian Gardner.|$|E

5|$|Evans <b>used</b> <b>a</b> woodblock {{printing}} technique known as chromoxylography, {{which was used}} primarily for inexpensive serialised books and children's books requiring few colours, so as to maximize profits. However, chromoxylography allowed a variety of hues and tones to be produced by mixing colours. The process was complicated and required intricate engraving to achieve the best results. Evans possessed a meticulous eye for detail and <b>used</b> <b>a</b> hand-press {{and as many as}} a dozen colour blocks for a single image. He {{went on to become the}} preeminent wood engraver and colour printer in Britain during the second half of the 19th century.|$|E
