5|$|The {{balanced}} growth theory {{is an economic}} theory pioneered by the economist Ragnar Nurkse (1907–1959). The theory hypothesises {{that the government of}} any <b>underdeveloped</b> <b>country</b> needs to make large investments in a number of industries simultaneously. This will enlarge the market size, increase productivity, and provide an incentive for the private sector to invest.|$|E
5|$|Another reason exports {{cannot be}} {{promoted}} is because in all likelihood, an <b>underdeveloped</b> <b>country</b> {{may only be}} skilled enough to promote the export of primary goods, say agricultural goods. However, since such commodities face inelastic demand, {{the extent to which}} they will sell in the market is limited. Although when population is at a rise, additional demand for exports may be created, Nurkse implicitly assumed that developed countries are operating at the replacement rate of population growth. For Nurkse, then, exports as a means of economic development are completely ruled out.|$|E
5|$|In fact, {{if such a}} {{strategy}} of financing development from outside the home country is undertaken, it creates a number of problems. For example, the foreign investors may carelessly misuse {{the resources of the}} <b>underdeveloped</b> <b>country.</b> This would in turn limit that economy's ability to diversify, especially if natural resources were plundered. This may also create a distorted social structure. Apart from this, there is also a risk that the foreign investments may be used to finance private luxury consumption. People would try to imitate Western consumption habits and thus a balance of payments crisis may develop, along with economic inequality within the population.|$|E

5|$|For example, in most {{underdeveloped}} economies, {{the technology}} {{used to carry}} out agricultural activities is backward. There is a low degree of mechanisation coupled with rain dependence. So while {{a large proportion of}} the population (70-80%) may be actively employed in the agriculture sector, the contribution to the Gross Domestic Product may be as low as 40%. This points to the need to increase output per unit input and output per head. This can be done if the government provides irrigation facilities, high-yielding variety seeds, pesticides, fertilisers, tractors etc. The positive outcome of this is that farmers earn more income and have a higher purchasing power (real income). Their demand for other products in the economy will rise and this will provide industrialists an incentive to invest in that country. Thus, the size of the market expands and improves the condition of the <b>underdeveloped</b> <b>country.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Ada's story, it is {{revealed}} that the Ada Wong that interacted with Chris and Piers was actually a doppelgänger created by Simmons, a scientist named Carla Radames, and that the real Ada Wong was aiding Leon and Sherry while destroying the Neo-Umbrella lab in Langshiang. It's soon revealed that Carla {{is the cause of}} the game's events, both wanting to get revenge on Simmons for the transformation and take over the world with her bioweapons. Although presumed dead after being shot by one of Simmons' soldiers, Carla attempts a final attack against the real Ada, after having injected herself with a powerful dose of the C-virus, but is killed. After aiding Leon and Helena in their battle with Simmons, Ada reaches the lab where her clone was developed and destroys everything. She then receives a call from someone, accepting a new assignment. With the world saved, the heroes continue with their lives: Leon and Helena are cleared for duty; Chris remains with the BSAA in command of a new squad, overcoming his guilt; and Sherry continues her duty as a DSO agent, while Jake starts a new life fighting zombies in an <b>underdeveloped</b> <b>country</b> with his real identity covered up by the BSAA, with Jake's blood sample able to be used for a C-virus cure.|$|E

[...] He also coined a comparison of India's [...] "thali" [...] to the American [...] "melting pot": [...] "If America is a melting pot, then to me India is a thali – a selection of sumptuous dishes in different bowls.

500|$|However, Nurkse {{clarified}} {{that the}} finance for this development must arise to as large an extent {{as possible from}} the <b>underdeveloped</b> <b>country</b> itself i.e. domestically. He stated that financing through increased trade or foreign investments was a strategy used in the past - the 19th century - and its success was limited to the case of the United States of America. In reality, the so-called [...] "new countries" [...] of the United States of America (which separated from the British empire) were high income countries to begin with. They were already endowed with efficient producers, effective markets and a high purchasing power. The point Nurkse was trying to make was that USA was rich in resource endowment as well as labour force. The labour force had merely migrated from Britain to USA, and thus their level of skills were advanced to begin with. This situation of outward led growth was therefore unique and not replicable by underdeveloped countries.|$|E

40|$|Globalisation as {{the most}} {{powerful}} phenomenon of the present time is widely contested for its positive and negative outcomes. This article distinguishes between political, economic and cultural globalisation and argues that globalisation as a process is mostly led and appreciated by the developed countries to meet their desired objectives, whereby <b>underdeveloped</b> <b>countries</b> are hurled into this process. Less equipped and less informed, these <b>underdeveloped</b> <b>countries</b> often stand in q disadvantaged position. The article maintains that several supra national economic, cultural and political organisations are the manifestation of the process of globalisation, which has made the policy making, process a complex phenomenon. The nation states {{have to deal with the}} pressures exerted by both other influential states and these international organisations, which seriously curtails the capacity of states to formulate its policies independent of any foreign influence and in favour of its citizens. Given this complex context, educational policies, like every other policy formed in <b>underdeveloped</b> <b>countries,</b> 2 ̆ 7 respond more to the globalisation process rather than national needs. This article tries to understand the globalisation phenomenon with respect to educational policy in <b>underdeveloped</b> <b>countries</b> and then explores the ways through which globalisation influences national educational policies...|$|R

2500|$|A {{developing}} country, {{also called}} a {{less developed country}} or an <b>underdeveloped</b> <b>country,</b> is a nation or a sovereign state with a less developed industrial base and a low Human Development Index (HDI) relative to other countries.

2500|$|Egypt derives a {{great deal}} of its foreign {{exchange}} from tourism. [...] Consequently, most of its labor force is devoted to the service sector. [...] Agriculture is also {{a large part of the}} Egyptian economy. [...] The Nile River provides Egypt with some of the most fertile land in the Middle East. [...] It produces food for consumption and export as well as cotton for domestic and foreign textile production. [...] Egypt's other great resource is the Suez Canal. [...] Roughly 7.5% of global sea trade transits the canal providing Egypt revenues in excess of $3 billion annually. [...] Egypt's industrial base dates back to the 1960s, when the nation undertook import substitution industrialization policies. [...] The inefficiencies of the state-run program have led the government to begin a privatization program and as a result Egypt enjoyed substantial GDP growth in the first decade of the 21st century.
