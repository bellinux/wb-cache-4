5000|$|Phthalates {{are used}} in some but not all PVC formulations, {{and there are no}} {{specific}} labeling requirements for phthalates. PVC plastics are typically used for various containers and hard packaging, medical tubing, and bags, and are labelled [...] "Type 3" [...] for recycling reasons. However, the presence of phthalates rather than other plasticizers is not marked on PVC items. Only <b>unplasticized</b> <b>PVC</b> (uPVC), which is mainly used as a hard construction material, has no plasticizers. If a more accurate test is needed, chemical analysis, for example by gas chromatography or liquid chromatography, can establish the presence of phthalates.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} by which phthalates and other molecules afford plasticization to polar polymers has been a subject of intense study since the 1960s. The mechanism is one of polar interactions between the polar centres of the phthalate molecule (the C=O functionality) and the positively charged areas of the vinyl chain, typically residing on the carbon atom of the carbon-chlorine bond. For this to be established, the polymer must be heated {{in the presence of}} the plasticizer, first above the Tg of the polymer and then into a melt state. This enables an intimate mix of polymer and plasticizer to be formed, and for these interactions to occur. When cooled, these interactions remain and the network of PVC chains cannot reform (as is present in <b>unplasticized</b> <b>PVC,</b> or PVC-U). The alkyl chains of the phthalate then screen the PVC chains from each other as well.|$|E
40|$|Awareness of the {{advantages}} of natural fibres has stimulated interest in their use to reinforce polymers. One type of natural fibre that is of great relevance to Malaysia is oil palm empty fruit bunches (EFB). To produce EFB-filled <b>unplasticized</b> poly(vinyl chloride) (<b>PVC)</b> composites, PVC resin and the various additives were first dry-blended using a laboratory blender before being milled into sheets on a two-roll mill. Test specimens were then hot pressed, alter which the mechanical and thermal properties were determined. Four untreated EFB fibre contents were employed, 10, 20, 30 and 40 phr. The increase in EPB fibre content resulted in an improvement in flexural modulus at the expense of impact strength and flexural strength. The incorporation of EFB slightly enhanced the glass transition temperature but it decreased the thermal stability of the composites, evidenced by a decrease in decomposition temperature and a change in the degradation process from two to three stages...|$|R

Studies on {{the correlation of}} long-term artificial aging and outdoor exposure of sealants {{that focused on the}} degradation of cohesive properties and surface appearance were reviewed by Wolf (1999).

40|$|International audiencePlasticized {{polyvinyl}} chloride (PVC) is widely present in contemporary Art collections but its conservation condition is often considered as poor. The project aims to deepen {{the understanding of}} thermal degradation mechanisms of plasticized PVC objects and to recommend preservation conditions and restoration treatments. Our research was carried out on plasticized PVC films naturally aged (around 30 years old) and exhibiting surface exudates. Plasticizers such as 13 % di-iso-octylphthalte (DOP) and 15 % di-octyl azelate (DOZ) were identified by Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry, both within the material and the exudates. Plasticizer migration and PVC degradation were studied during a cyclic thermal artificial aging (2 days 80 °C/ 1 day 25 °C at 65 % RH). PVC films were placed either in an open or a closed vessel, {{and whether or not}} submitted to a preliminary cleaning with a microfiber cloth. This study shows that all samples undergo a similar degradation process, which is significantly slowed in a closed packaging with respect to an open one, in agreement with previous studies[1]. Regardless of any packaging condition, no effect of the preliminary cleaning is evidenced. In an open packaging, a significant plasticizer loss is thus observed, since almost no plasticizer is detected in the samples after 15 weeks of thermal aging. This migration is accompanied by a α-relaxation temperature increase up to a value close to the one measured for <b>unplasticized</b> <b>PVC,</b> which is consistent with the absence of plasticizer at this stage. Dehydrochlorination is evidenced from with Infrared and UV-visible spectroscopies, in agreement with the PVC yellowing. No exudation phenomenon related to plasticizer migration is observed with the naked eye however dendritic structures attributed to the migration of hindered amine light stabilizers are detected by Atomic Force Microscopy. Future work is devoted to study the effect of the wrapping materials. Reference[1]Y. R. Shashoua, Polym. Degrad. Stab. 81 (2003) 29 - 3...|$|E
40|$|Initial {{adhesion}} of fungi to plasticized {{polyvinyl chloride}} (pPVC) may determine subsequent colonization and biodeterioration processes. The deteriogenic fungus Aureobasidium pullulans {{was used to}} investigate the physicochemical nature of adhesion to both <b>unplasticized</b> <b>PVC</b> (uPVC) and pPVC containing the plasticizers dioctyl phthalate (DOP) and dioctyl adipate (DOA). A quantitative adhesion assay using image analysis identified fundamental differences in the mechanism of adhesion of A. pullulans blastospores to these substrata, Adhesion to pPVC was greater than that to uPVC by a maximum of 280 % after a 4 -h incubation with 10 (8) blastospores ml(- 1). That plasticizers enhance adhesion to PVC was confirmed by incorporating a dispersion of both DOA and DOP into the blastospore suspension. Adhesion to uPVC was increased by up to 308 % {{in the presence of}} the dispersed plasticizers. Hydrophobic interactions were found to dominate adhesion to uPVC because (i) a strong positive correlation was observed between substratum hydrophobicity (measured by using a dynamic contact angle analyzer) and adhesion to a range of unplasticized polymers including uPVC, and (ii) neither the pH nor the electrolyte concentration of the suspension buffer, both of which influence electrostatic interactions, affected adhesion to uPVC. In contrast, adhesion to pPVC is principally controlled by electrostatic interactions. Enhanced adhesion to pPVC occurred despite a relative reduction of 13 degrees in the water contact angle of pPVC compared to that of uPVC. Furthermore, adhesion to pPVC was strongly dependent on both the pH and electrolyte concentration of the suspension medium, reaching maximum levels at pH 8 and with an electrolyte concentration of 10 mM NaCl. Plasticization with DOP and DOA therefore increases adhesion of A. pullulans blastospores to pPVC through an interaction mediated by electrostatic forces...|$|E
40|$|Liquids and gases {{are usually}} {{conducted}} via pipelines. Buried pipelines {{are used in}} sanitary environmental engineering, agriculture or estate drainage. The pipe dimension and pipe geometry depend on static and hydraulic demands. Flexible plastics pipes are regarded as cost-efficient in laying and service due to the low self-weight and high chemical resistance of the material. Deformation, stability and watertightness are under consideration. While many authors {{are concerned with the}} investigation of deformation, only a few are discussing the reasons of deformation comprehensibly. Moreover, the pressure load of a buried pipeline is unexplained. Even though a complete and traceable description of the force-deflection behaviour is still missing, buried pipelines are determined statically. The calculations are usually made as suggested in guideline ATV-DVWK-A 127 by the German Association for Water, Wastewater and Waste. The object of this dissertation is the experimental identification of the pressure loading and deformation of flexible pipes under different boundary conditions and the numerical treatment. Two large-scale simulation tests are described, investigating the entire load history. The realized experiments are able to explain the time-dependent force-deflection behaviour of flexible pipes. It turns out that pressure loading and deformation of a pipeline are strongly affected by the compaction of the soil. The numerical treatment uses the Finite-Element-Method. The time-temperature-dependent behaviour of the <b>unplasticized</b> <b>PVC</b> is represented by the theory of linear viscoelasticity. The matter constants are derived from creep tests at different temperatures. The mechanical properties of loose and dense granular materials are represented by a hypoplastic constitutive law. The matter constants are derived from triaxial tests. Good results are obtained in simulating the installation and compaction of each soil layer in the trench. Finally, the guideline ATV-DVWK-A 127 is reviewed. The assumptions made in this guideline do not bear comparison with the test results presented in this thesis, essentially because the compaction is not considered as a loadcase...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concentrates}} on three main {{areas of research}} in the field of poly(vinyl chloride), PVC: (1) microstructure determination and local chain motions of PVC in a plasticized system, (2) permeability of PVC and plasticized PVC to gases, and (3) computer modeling of the thermal degradation of PVC. A quantitative carbon- 13 NMR spectrum of PVC in 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrachloroethane-d$ sb 2 $ (TCE-d$ sb 2 $) was recorded. Theoretical predictions using Bernoullian statistics permitted the reassignment of several resonances. Carbon- 13 spin-lattice relaxation times and NOE values were measured as a function of temperature at two magnetic fields for PVC in two solvents, di-butyl phthalate (DBP) and TCE-d$ sb 2 $. The difference found in the simulation parameters, from the Dejean-Laupretre-Monnerie model, for PVC in the two solvents were rationalized by assuming a specific interaction between DBP and the CHCl group of PVC and to the relative solvent quality. The permeability coefficients, P, of PVC films to oxygen were measured as a function of temperature and plasticizer type and concentration. The plasticizers used were di-(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DOP), tri-butyl phosphate (TBP), and a binary mixture of the two with a concentration of $ rm Phi sb{DOP}$ = 0. 6). The effect of plasticizer type on the permeation coefficients of oxygen followed the trend: P(TBP) $>$ P($ rm Phi sb{DOP}$ = 0. 6) $>$ P(DOP). Arrhenius plots of the permeability coefficients showed that the unplasticized and plasticized PVC films of low concentration of plasticizer ($ rm Phi sb{plas} < 0. 2 $) displayed a discrete change in the slope, {{in the vicinity of the}} glass transition temperature, that reflected changes in the activation energy for permeation. In addition, the permeation and diffusion coefficients of oxygen and hydrogen chloride gases in an <b>unplasticized</b> <b>PVC</b> film were measured as a function of temperature. The results suggest that the increase in segmental mobility of the polymer chains above the T$ rm sb{g}$ increases the diffusivity as well as the zone of activation for diffusion leading to the increase in segmental mobility of the polymer chains above the T$ rm sb{g}$ increases the diffusivity as well as the zone of activation for diffusion leading to the increase in both energy and entropy of activation. A computer program has been written which simulates, according to Bernoullian statistics, the relative handedness of successive monomer units during polymerization and calculates the probabilities of configurational sequences before and after a specified degradation mechanism. At levels of degradation that are accessible to experimental verification by solution NMR ($<$ 2 %), the changes in isotacticity that are predicted by these simulations are at (or under) the limits of experimental error. Furthermore, the simulations indicate that for the degradation to result in double bond lengths that correspond to experimentally determined values requires that the dehydrochlorination also include some atactic and syndiotactic sequences which, in turn, reduces the changes in P$ rm sb{mm}$.
