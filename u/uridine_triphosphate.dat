25|$|Glycogen {{synthesis}} is, unlike its breakdown, endergonic—it {{requires the}} input of energy. Energy for glycogen synthesis comes from <b>uridine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (UTP), which reacts with glucose-1-phosphate, forming UDP-glucose, in a reaction catalysed by UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. Glycogen is synthesized from monomers of UDP-glucose initially by the protein glycogenin, which has two tyrosine anchors for the reducing end of glycogen, since glycogenin is a homodimer. After about eight glucose molecules {{have been added to}} a tyrosine residue, the enzyme glycogen synthase progressively lengthens the glycogen chain using UDP-glucose, adding α(1→4)-bonded glucose. The glycogen branching enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of six or seven glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C-6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule. The branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 residues, and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains.|$|E

The RNA is reverse transcribed with either polyT primers (which amplify only mRNA) or random primers (which amplify all RNA, {{most of which}} is rRNA); miRNA microarrays ligate an oligonucleotide to the purified small RNA (isolated with a fractionator), which is then reverse transcribed and amplified. The label is added either during the reverse transcription step, or following amplification if it is performed. The sense labelling {{is dependent on the}} microarray; e.g. if the label is added with the RT mix, the cDNA is antisense and the microarray probe is sense, except in the case of negative controls. The label is typically fluorescent; only one machine uses radiolabels. The labelling can be direct (not used) or indirect (requires a coupling stage). For two-channel arrays, the coupling stage occurs before hybridization, using aminoallyl <b>uridine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (aminoallyl-UTP, or aaUTP) and NHS amino-reactive dyes (such as cyanine dyes); for single-channel arrays, the coupling stage occurs after hybridization, using biotin and labelled streptavidin. The modified nucleotides (usually in a ratio of 1 aaUTP: 4 TTP (thymidine triphosphate)) are added enzymatically in a low ratio to normal nucleotides, typically resulting in 1 every 60 bases. The aaDNA is then purified with a column (using a phosphate buffer solution, as Tris contains amine groups). The aminoallyl group is an amine group on a long linker attached to the nucleobase, which reacts with a reactive dye. A form of replicate known as a dye flip can be performed to remove any dye effects in two-channel experiments; for a dye flip, a second slide is used, with the labels swapped (the sample that was labeled with Cy3 in the first slide is labeled with Cy5, and vice versa). In this example, aminoallyl-UTP is present in the reverse-transcribed mixture.|$|E

The requirement for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) can be partially replaced by guanosine or inosine triphosphates, but not by cytidine or <b>uridine</b> <b>triphosphates.</b> The Mn++ was required for activity, and the requirement cannot be satisfied with Mg++. Maximal activity of the biosynthetic reaction was observed when ATP and Mn++ were present in equimolar amounts. An excess of either reactant gave less activity. However, other purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, when added in combination with ATP, can partially substitute for ATP in attaining the equimolar ratio of nucleotide to Mn++. A complex of ATP and Mn++ is the preferred form of substrate. The B. licheniformis enzyme catalyzes the glutamyl transfer reaction but at a much slower rate than the Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase.

40|$|Using a {{combination}} of several methods for protein sequence comparison and motif analysis, it is shown that the four recently described pseudouridine syntheses with different specificities belong to four distinct families.

Two of the pseudouridine syntheses, one of which modifies the anticodon arm of tRNAs and the other is predicted to modify a portion of the large ribosomal subunit RNA belonging to the peptidyltransferase center, are encoded in all extensively sequenced genomes, including the 'minimal' genome of Mycoplasma genitalium.

As nucleic acid aptamers recognize specific molecular targets, we investigated the influence of boronated nucleotide analogs on RNA function and on the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) process. Substitution of guanosine 5 ′-(α-P-borano) triphosphate (bG) for GTP or <b>uridine</b> 5 ′-(α-P-borano) <b>triphosphate</b> (bU) for UTP in several known aptamers diminished or eliminated target recognition by those RNAs. Specifically, ATP-binding aptamers containing the ζ-fold, which appears in several selections for adenosine aptamers, became inactive upon bG substitution but were only moderately affected by bU substitution. Selections were carried out using the bG or bU analogs with C 8 -linked ATP agarose as the binding target. The selections with bU and normal NTP yielded some ζ-fold aptamers, while the bG selection yielded none of this type. Non-ζ aptamers from bU and bG populations tolerated the borano substitution and many required it. The borano nucleotide requirement is specific; bU could not be used in bG-dependent aptamers nor vice versa. The borano group plays an essential role, as yet undefined, in target recognition or RNA structure. We conclude that the bG and bU nucleotides are fully compatible with SELEX, and that these analogs could be used to make boronated aptamers as therapeutics for BNCT...|$|R

MedeirosLaman MamedovaThe {{internalization}} of aggregated low-­density lipoprotein (agLDL) {{may involve}} the actin cytoskeleton {{in ways that}} differ from the endocytosis of soluble LDL. Based on previous findings the P 2 Y[subscript] 2 receptor (P 2 Y[subscript] 2 R) mediates these effects through interaction with filamin‐A (FLN‐A), an actin binding protein. Our findings also showed that <b>uridine</b> 5 ’‐ <b>triphosphate</b> (UTP), a preferential agonist of the P 2 Y[subscript] 2 R, stimulates the uptake of agLDL, and increases expression of low‐density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (LRP 1) in cultured mouse vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). The strategy {{of this research was}} to define novel mechanisms of LDL uptake through the modulation of the actin cytoskeleton in order to identify molecular targets involved in foam cell formation in vascular SMCs. For this project, we isolated aortic SMCs from wild type (WT) and P 2 Y[subscript] 2 R‐/‐ mice to investigate whether UTP and the P 2 Y[subscript] 2 R modulate expression of LRP 1 and low‐density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). We also investigated the effects of UTP on uptake of DiI‐labeled agLDL in WT and P 2 Y[subscript] 2 R‐/‐ vascular SMCs. For LRP 1 expression, cells were stimulated in {{the presence or absence of}} 10 [mu]M UTP. To determine LDLR mRNA expression, and for agLDL uptake, cells were transiently transfected for 24 h with cDNA encoding hemagglutinin-­tagged (HA-­tagged) WT P 2 Y[subscript] 2 R or a mutant P 2 Y[subscript] 2 R that does not bind FLN‐A, and afterwards treated with 10 [mu]M UTP. Total RNA was isolated, reversed transcribed to cDNA, and mRNA relative abundance determined by RT-­PCR using the delta-­delta Ct method with GAPDH as control gene. Results show SMCs expressing the mutant P 2 Y[subscript] 2 R that lacks the FLN‐A binding domain exhibit 3 ‐fold lower LDLR expression than SMCs expressing the WT P 2 Y[subscript] 2 R. There was also decrease in LRP 1 mRNA expression in response to UTP in P 2 Y[subscript] 2 R‐/‐ SMCs compared to WT. Actinomycin‐D (20 [mu]g/ml) significantly reduced UTP-­induced LRP 1 mRNA expression in P 2 Y[subscript] 2 R‐/‐ SMCs (P < 0. 05). Compared to cells transfected with mutant P 2 Y[subscript] 2 R, cells transfected with WT P 2 Y[subscript] 2 R showed greater agLDL uptake in both WT VSMC and P 2 Y[subscript] 2 R-­/-­ cells. Together these results show that both LRP 1 and LDLR expressions are dependent on an intact P 2 Y[subscript] 2 R, and P 2 Y[subscript] 2 R/ FLN‐ A interaction is necessary for agLDL uptake...|$|R
