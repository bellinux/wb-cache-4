40|$|An in-situ {{nondestructive}} inspection {{was conducted to}} detect manufacturing and assembly induced defects in the upper two wing surfaces (<b>skin</b> s) and <b>upper</b> fuselage <b>skin</b> of the Lear Fan 2100 aircraft E 009.

50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was built}} around spruce longerons and struts with some plywood frames {{and covered with}} stress bearing 3-ply mahogany about 2.4 mm (0.094 in) thick. Unusually, there were five main longerons. In the central region of the fuselage four of them defined a deep rectangle but the upper two came towards each other together rearwards producing an isosceles trapizoidal section. A fifth longeron ran centrally above them, positioned so that the overall fuselage section was an isosceles triangle at the rear. Further forward, as the upper longerons separated, the fuselage had five flat faces. The side faces came together at the nose to form a vertical knife-edge and the bottom face curved upwards. The open cockpit was formed by {{a break in the}} <b>upper</b> <b>skinning,</b> though the fifth, upper, longeron continued over the pilot's head.

These parameters vary continuously during flight, to {{which means the}} wing geometry seldom is optimal. According to aerodynamic investigations a chordwise variation of the wing camber leads to improvements in operational flexibility, buffet boundaries and performance resulting in reduction of fuel consumption. A spanwise differential camber variation allows to gain control over spanwise lift distributions reducing wing root bending moments. This paper describes the design of flexible Fowler flaps for an adaptiv wing {{to be used in}} civil transport aircraft that allows both a chodwise as well as a spanwise differential camber variation during flight. Since both lower and <b>upper</b> <b>skins</b> are flexed by active ribs, the camber variation is achieved with a smooth contour and without any additional gaps...|$|R

Of the 13 variables, the wing-tip design was controlled primarily by the thickness of the thickest plies in the <b>upper</b> <b>skins.</b> The report includes an analysis of the optimization results and recommendations for future reliability-based studies...|$|R

In this work, the feasibility of targeting IDE into the upper layers of the skin by topical application of IDE-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) was evaluated. SLN loading different amounts of IDE were prepared by the phase inversion temperature method using cetyl palmitate as solid lipid and three different non-ionic surfactants: ceteth- 20, isoceteth- 20 and oleth- 20. All IDE loaded SLN showed a mean particle size in the range of 30 – 49 nm and a single peak in size distribution. In vitro permeation/penetration experiments were performed on pig skin using Franz-type diffusion cells. IDE penetration into the different skin layers depended on the type of SLN used while no IDE permeation occurred from all the SLN under investigation. The highest IDE content was found in the epidermis when SLN contained ceteth- 20 or isoceteth- 20 as surfactant while IDE distribution into the <b>upper</b> <b>skin</b> layers depended on the amount of IDE loaded when oleth- 20 was used as surfactant.

40|$|Purpose: To {{analyze the}} {{distribution}} and characteristics of <b>upper</b> eyelid <b>skin</b> elastic fibers in different areas of skin thickness and {{in relation to the}} eyelid crease. Methods: We used 12 postmortem eyelids (6 right, 6 left) of 10 Asian cadavers (mean age: 77. 1 years at death), fixed in 10 % buffered formalin. Full-thickness sagittal sections of the upper eyelids were dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and cut in 7 -µm-thick sections. The sliced sections were stained with elastica van Gieson. Results: The <b>upper</b> eyelid <b>skin</b> was divided in 2 areas; the thinner and thicker areas. The average distance from the eyelid margin to the border between the 2 areas was 17. 8 mm (range, 12. 8 – 24. 0 mm). Ten eyelids showed a small amount of elastic fibers in the thinner skin area, and 2 eyelids were rich in elastic fibers in the same area. The volume of elastic fibers multiplied in the thicker skin area. The elastic fibers in the eyelid margin area were fine and nonfragmented, whereas in other areas they were thicker and more fragmented. A part below the skin creases showed the same concentration of elastic fibers to other areas of the <b>upper</b> eyelid <b>skin.</b> Conclusions: Most <b>upper</b> eyelids demonstrated a small amount of elastic fibers in the thinner skin area and a larger amount in the thicker area. The eyelid margin elastic fibers had a normal morphology, whereas in other areas they were more disintegrated, thicker, and fragmented. The eyelid creases and the elastic fiber concentration were unrelated. Hirohiko Kakizaki, Yasuhiro Takahashi, Takashi Nakano, Hiroshi Ikeda, Dinesh Selva, and Igal Leibovitc...|$|R
