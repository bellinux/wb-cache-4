5|$|Despite the limitations, Robinett {{was able}} to {{introduce}} concepts {{that at the time}} were <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>to</b> players. He had been able to construct different rooms in the games (thirty in the final version), in days where most games took place only on a single screen. Further, off-screen objects such as the bat would continue to move according to their programming behavior.|$|E
5|$|Spectroscopic {{methods were}} {{predominantly}} used by physicists and astrophysicists. Spectroscopic techniques were rarely taught in chemistry classes and were <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>to</b> most practicing chemists. Beginning around 1904, Frank Twyman of the London instrument making firm Adam Hilger, Ltd. tried to develop spectroscopic instruments for chemists, but his customer base was consistently {{made up of}} physicists rather than chemists.|$|E
5|$|In Leiden, the {{congregation}} gained {{the freedom to}} worship as they chose, but Dutch society was <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>to</b> them. Scrooby had been an agricultural community, whereas Leiden was a thriving industrial center, and the Separatists found the pace of life difficult. The community remained close-knit, but their children began adopting the Dutch language and customs, and some also entered the Dutch Army. The Puritans also were still not free from the persecutions of the English Crown. English authorities came to Leiden to arrest William Brewster in 1618, after he published comments {{highly critical of the}} King of England and the Anglican Church. Brewster escaped arrest, but the events spurred {{the congregation}} to move farther from England.|$|E

5|$|Susan Hall {{wrote that}} there is no rule of law in the books, as the actions of Ministry of Magic {{officials}} are unconstrained by laws, accountability or any kind of legal challenge. This provides an opportunity for Voldemort to offer his own horrific version of order. As a side-effect Harry and Hermione, who were brought up in the highly regulated Muggle world, find solutions by thinking in ways <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>to</b> wizards. For example, Hermione notes that one obstacle to finding the Philosopher's Stone is a test of logic rather than magical power, and that most wizards have no chance of solving it.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} tour South Africa that winter with the MCC. The cricketing conditions were challenging: matches were played on matting pitches, <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>to</b> English players, and the South African googly bowlers had previously troubled most leading English batsmen, provoking debate over how batsmen could combat the new delivery. The MCC captain, Leveson Gower, selected Wilfred Rhodes to open the batting with Hobbs for the first Test. Rhodes, a defensively-minded batsman who excelled at taking quick singles, had begun {{his career as a}} bowler who batted down the order. He steadily improved his batting, eventually becoming an opening batsman. Hobbs and Rhodes, between 1910 and 1921, opened the batting 36 times for England and shared eight century partnerships; their average of 61.31 runs per opening partnership remains the second highest in Test history. In other first-class cricket, they shared a further five century opening partnerships. Their association was notable for effective running; the pair developed such an unusually good understanding {{that they were able to}} run without calling to each other. They scored singles by pushing the ball just past nearby fielders and running quickly. Critics believed that they raised the art of running to a new level.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} Umbricht's death, the Colts decided to honor their {{teammate}} by wearing black armbands {{for the entire}} 1964 season. Umbricht's uniform number (32) was immediately retired by the team; {{it was the first}} time the club retired a uniform number, and only the ninth time in Major League history a number was retired. In the Colts' opening-day match against the Cincinnati Reds, starting pitcher Ken Johnson dedicated his victory in Umbricht's memory. The Astros' MVP award was also named in his honor. The back of Umbricht's 1964 Topps baseball card was updated to mention his death shortly before printing. The retirement of Umbricht's number received some criticism, however. Former teammate Jimmy Wynn wrote in his autobiography that Walt Bond, a former Astros player who was African-American, died from leukemia while he was still active. His jersey number was not retired by the club after his death, although he appeared in more games for the Astros than Umbricht. (It should be noted, however, that Bond ended his career not with Houston but as a member of the Minnesota Twins.) Journalists criticizing the retirement of numbers sometimes use Umbricht as an example of someone whose number was retired but who is <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>to</b> baseball fans.|$|E
50|$|A person's {{level of}} arousal when {{introduced}} to stimuli can {{be indicative of}} his or her preferences. One study found that familiar stimuli are often preferred <b>to</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> stimuli. The findings suggested that the exposure <b>to</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> stimuli was correlated to avoidance behaviors. The unfamiliar stimuli may lead to increased arousal and increased avoidance behaviors.|$|R

5|$|The {{planning}} {{system is}} critical to the viability and operation of GA aerodromes. With many cities lacking scheduled air transport services between them, and with GA access to commercial airports becoming increasingly difficult and expensive, a viable network of aerodromes supporting GA air transport operations is regarded as an important national issue. However, there is no unified national planning policy specific to GA aerodromes, and planning decisions relating to these are based on local issues that are not required to consider the national impact. Because aircraft are excluded from noise control legislation, the only recourse for people affected by aircraft noise is through the planning process, and this issue is the principal factor on which the majority of planning decisions relating to GA land use are made. GA is a specialist subject often <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>to</b> Local Planning Authorities, and most planning decisions relating to GA either refuse permission, or grant it with restrictive conditions. Little Gransden is just one example of a GA airfield required to comply with planning restrictions on the number of movements permitted, thereby inhibiting further development. Such restrictions, if poorly conceived, can make GA operations unviable or even unsafe.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} an animal to perform a task {{successfully}} {{is limited by the}} amount of attention being simultaneously focused on other activities. One way in which individuals might reduce the cost of divided attention is by preferentially focusing on the most beneficial tasks. In territorial animals where aggression is lower among familiar individuals, the decision to associate preferentially with familiar conspecifics may therefore confer advantages by allowing attention to be switched from aggression to predator vigilance and feeding. Wild juvenile brown trout were used to test the prediction that familiar fishes respond more quickly than <b>unfamiliar</b> fishes <b>to</b> a simulated predator attack. Our results confirm this prediction by demonstrating that familiar trout respond 14 % faster than <b>unfamiliar</b> individuals <b>to</b> a predator attack. The results also show that familiar fishes consume a greater number of food items, foraging at more than twice the rate of <b>unfamiliar</b> conspecifics. <b>To</b> the best of our knowledge, these results provide the first evidence that familiarity-biased association confers advantages through the immediate fitness benefits afforded by faster predator-evasion responses and the long-term benefits provided by increased feeding opportunities...|$|R

25|$|One of the {{challenges}} in adapting the Latin script to many African languages was the use in those tongues of sounds <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>to</b> Europeans and thus without writing convention they could resort to.
