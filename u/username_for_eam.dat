40|$|Management of today’s IT is a {{challenging}} task {{that requires a}} profound understanding of both the IT landscape and the relevant business context. In this regard, enterprise architecture management (EAM) aims at structuring an enterprise by providing purposeful abstractions of both IT and the surrounding action systems and thereby {{takes into account the}} relevant business context. For this purpose, it offers graphical modeling languages that provide stakeholders with specific and illustrative views on a company at various organizational levels, such as on value chains, business processes, or IT landscapes. Accordingly, the modeling languages are an essential part of EAM. The development of domain-specific modeling languages (DSML) has gained remarkable attention. They promise to increase the speed and ease of software development, prevent the construction of nonsensical models, improve modeling productivity as well as model quality. In this paper, we explore to which extent current approaches <b>for</b> <b>EAM</b> utilize domain-specific modeling and how requirements from the very core of EAM are fulfilled by corresponding DSMLs. In this respect, an extensive analysis of modeling requirements in the context of EAM serves to assess existing approaches. Finally, we identify future research topics that should lead to a more sophisticated use of DSMLs <b>for</b> <b>EAM</b> and foster a closer collaboration between both communities...|$|R

30|$|In this work, we {{investigated}} {{the use of}} 10 -layer InAs quantum dot (QD) as active region of an electroabsorption modulator (EAM). The QD-EAM is a p-i-n ridge waveguide structure with intrinsic layer thickness of 0.4 μm, width of 10 μm, and length of 1.0 mm. Photocurrent measurement reveals a Stark shift of ~ 5 meV (~ 7 nm) at reverse bias of 3 V (75 kV/cm) and broadening of the resonance peak due to field ionization of electrons and holes was observed for E-field larger than 25 kV/cm. Investigation at wavelength range of 1, 300 – 1320 nm reveals that the largest absorption change occurs at 1317 nm. Optical transmission measurement at this wavelength shows insertion loss of ~ 8 dB, and extinction ratio of ~ 5 dB at reverse bias of 5 V.

There are some common cycles in the EAM and solar variability from centennial to millennial scales, indicating a possible link between EAM and solar activity at these time scales. The correlation between EAM and solar activity is much higher at millennial scales than at centennial scales, which means direct responses to the solar variation are more likely at time scales longer than a few hundred years. At ~ 30, 60 and 600 yr time scales, the variation in EAM is amplified by the solar amplitude modulation at ~ 100, 200 and 2200 yr time scales...|$|R
