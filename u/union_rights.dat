5|$|Article8 {{recognises}} {{the right}} of workers to form or join trade unions and protects the right to strike. It allows these rights to be restricted {{for members of the}} armed forces, police, or government administrators. Several parties have placed reservations on this clause, allowing it to be interpreted {{in a manner consistent with}} their constitutions (e.g.,China, Mexico), or extending the restriction of <b>union</b> <b>rights</b> to groups such as firefighters (e.g.,Japan).|$|E
5|$|However, {{it is not}} {{yet clear}} whether the {{citizenship}} rights in articles 18 and 21 TFEU are partly available to them as British Citizens, given the limited restriction of their rights under article 2 of the Protocol. That restriction on the exercise of certain freedoms does not apply to all Community or <b>Union</b> <b>rights.</b> The freedom of movement under the prior EC régime was and remains a separate set of rights from the Citizen rights under article 20 and 21 TFEU which include the right to move and reside. Those rights are primary citizenship rights, not a mere freedom. It might not need a Treaty change to perfect this, merely a preliminary ruling from the CJEU, and supplementary implementation measures from the Council, given the effective right of entrance and residence granted to EU nationals via Article 4 of the Protocol. Jersey residents presently do not have a right to vote in elections for the European Parliament. Jersey and Guernsey jointly opened an office in Brussels in 2010 to promote their common interests with European Union institutions.|$|E

25|$|The {{principal}} ideological disagreement Socialist Studies {{has with}} the Socialist Party of Great Britain is its attitude towards attempts by workers living under political dictatorships to establish elementary democratic and trade <b>union</b> <b>rights,</b> especially in Eastern Europe in the 1980s and early 1990s.|$|E

25|$|Shortly after, the {{executive}} director and other staff members of NYSTA began to meet with Shanker and his aides to discuss {{the possibility of a}} merger. Each union had spent large amounts of money battling the other for bargaining rights and members while the state legislature and local school districts steadily chipped away at <b>union</b> <b>rights</b> and collective bargaining agreements.|$|E
25|$|HPAE's {{precursor}} union, the Englewood Hospital Nurses Association, {{was formed}} in 1974 when Ann Twomey, a registered nurse, organized an independent nurses union at Englewood Hospital in Englewood, New Jersey. Shift rotation, floating, low wages and {{a general lack of}} respect from management drove Twomey and the other Englewood nurses to organize at a time when federal labor law had only just begun to recognize the <b>union</b> <b>rights</b> of registered nurses.|$|E
25|$|In 1896 the Western Federation of Miners {{was already}} thought by contemporaries to be radical and militant, but {{was in fact}} {{dedicated}} to essentially conservative goals: decent wages paid in legal tender rather than scrip, health care for miners, restrictions on cheap immigrant labor, the disarming of detectives, and friendly relationships with employers. They envisioned an eventual end to confrontation and strikes. The WFM was unprepared for the determination and power that mine owners would bring to bear during struggles for <b>union</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, for {{the second}} time, Lee was {{dividing}} his army. Jackson would lead his Second Corps of 28,000 men around to attack the <b>Union</b> <b>right</b> flank while Lee exercised personal command of the remaining two divisions, about 13,000 men and 24 guns facing the 70,000 Union troops at Chancellorsville. For the plan to work, several things had to happen. First, Jackson {{had to make a}} 12-mile (19km) march via roundabout roads to reach the <b>Union</b> <b>right,</b> and he had to do it undetected. Second, Hooker had to stay tamely on the defensive. Third, Early would have to keep Sedgwick bottled up at Fredericksburg, despite the four-to-one Union advantage there. And when Jackson launched his attack, he had to hope that the Union forces were unprepared.|$|R
50|$|The sectoral congressmen {{represent}} the minority {{sectors of the}} population.

25|$|The Battle of Chancellorsville was {{depicted}} in the 2003 film Gods and Generals, {{based on the novel}} of the same name.

25|$|After a {{by-election}} {{defeat in}} 1942, {{a group of}} younger Conservatives from the Conservative Party of Canada met in Port Hope, Ontario, {{to develop a new}} Conservative policy they hoped would bring them out of the political wilderness. The participants, known as the Port Hopefuls, developed a program including many Conservative goals such as support for free enterprise and conscription. Yet the charter also included more radical policies, such as full-employment, low-cost housing, trade <b>union</b> <b>rights,</b> as well as a whole range of social security measures, including a government financed medicare system.|$|E
25|$|White was an {{advocate}} for jobs, labour and human rights before several international forums including the G8 and the OECD (the organization of the 25 most industrial nations). White was the President of the Trade Union Advisory Committee (TUAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). He was the first Canadian to hold the post. White was {{the chair of the}} Commonwealth Trade Union Council. White was also the chair of the Human and Trade <b>Union</b> <b>Rights</b> Committee of the 126 million-member International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, the largest trade union body in the world.|$|E
25|$|The {{right to}} strike {{is one of the}} {{essential}} means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their economic and social interests. The Committee considers that this basic right is not really guaranteed when a worker who exercises it legally runs the risk of seeing his or her job taken up permanently by another worker, just as legally. The Committee considers that, if a strike is otherwise legal, the use of labour drawn from outside the undertaking to replace strikers for an indeterminate period entails a risk of derogation from the {{right to strike}} which may affect the free exercise of trade <b>union</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|E

50|$|Lee now {{feels his}} {{advantage}} {{and wants to}} use it. His plan is to send two of Beauregard's divisions as well as Robertson and Mclaws to assault the <b>union</b> <b>right</b> by going down south, cross the river, and roll up the road that longs along the Union line.|$|R

25|$|This {{meant that}} a group of car valeters, {{although}} described in their contracts as being self-employed, with a right to substitute another person to do their work, and professed to have no obligation to undertake work, were entitled to a minimum wage and paid leave. The contract terms could be disregarded because they did not represent the reality of the situation. In addition, a ‘worker’ is defined in ERA 1996 section 230 as someone with a contract of employment or who personally performs work and is not a client or a customer. This concept has greater scope, and protects more people, than does the term ‘employee’. This class of person is entitled to a safe system of work, a minimum wage and limits on working time, as well as discrimination and trade <b>union</b> <b>rights,</b> but not job security, child care and retirement rights. This concept thus reaches up to protect people who are quasi-self-employed professionals, such as partners of a law firm. People will also be workers but not employees when they are not so vulnerable, and relatively independent from their employers, such as home cleaners, music teachers who visit a student home, or independent taxi cab drivers. However, if they are employed through an agency, they will be employees in relation to the agency. Though not entitled to employee rights, these workers may form trade unions and take collective action under UK, EU and international law, to protect their interests.|$|E
500|$|The International Transport Workers' Federation goes further, {{stating that}} flags of {{convenience}} [...] "provide {{a means of}} avoiding labor regulation {{in the country of}} ownership, and become a vehicle for paying low wages and forcing long hours of work and unsafe working conditions. Since FOC ships have no real nationality, they are beyond the reach of any single national seafarers' trade union." [...] They also say that these ships have low safety standards and no construction requirements, that they [...] "do not enforce safety standards, minimum social standards or trade <b>union</b> <b>rights</b> for seafarers", that they frequently fail to pay their crews, have poor safety records, and engage in practices such as abandoning crewmen in distant ports.|$|E
500|$|The {{legislation}} was enacted in June 1933 during the Great Depression in the United States {{as part of}} President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal legislative program. Section 7(a) of the bill, which protected collective bargaining rights for unions, proved contentious (especially in the Senate), but both chambers eventually passed the legislation. President Roosevelt signed the bill into law on June 16, 1933. The Act had two main sections (or [...] "titles"). Title I was devoted to industrial recovery, authorizing the promulgation of industrial codes of fair competition, guaranteed trade <b>union</b> <b>rights,</b> permitted the regulation of working standards, and regulated the price of certain refined petroleum products and their transportation. Title II established the Public Works Administration, outlined the projects and funding opportunities it could engage in. Title II also provided funding for the Act.|$|E
25|$|At 5 p.m., the Confederate forces {{launched}} their attack, charging the entire Union line. Walker's and Mouton's {{attack on the}} <b>Union</b> <b>right</b> had little success — the <b>Union</b> <b>right,</b> for the most part, held its ground. However, overall, this initial charge by the Confederates was highly successful {{and many of the}} positions down the Union left and center were overrun by Churchill's and Parson's forces and the Union positions were forced backwards. However, the Union side succeeded in halting the advance and regained the left and center ground, before driving the Confederates from the field. The fiercely fought battle lasted about two hours. Losses were heavy on both sides. The 32nd Iowa Infantry sustained especially heavy casualties, as it was cut {{off from the rest of}} the Union forces during the battle.|$|R
50|$|By 4 p.m., the Union {{appeared}} to have the advantage in the battle. Canby decided that a massive frontal assault would fail and instead decided to attack the Confederate left; to do so, he ordered one of his batteries on his right to redeploy closer to the Confederate line and moved several companies to his right, including Carson's First New Mexico Regiment which crossed the river and took its place in line. However, this repositioning of the troops weakened {{the center of the}} Union line and the battery on Canby's left. Hoping to stall the Union attack, Green ordered Major Henry Raguet to attack the <b>Union</b> <b>right</b> with his battalion; this attack was repulsed by frontal fire and a flank attack from the 1st New Mexico, and the <b>Union</b> <b>right</b> advanced after the retreating Confederates.|$|R
