The units seek to develop students’ knowledge, understanding and skills in listening, reading, viewing, speaking, writing and creating, and incorporate the content descriptions of all three curriculum strands of Language, Literature and Literacy. A key feature throughout the series is the consistent design and layout. Part 1 explains the approach and outlines the {{theory and practice of}} curriculum design while Part 2 outlines the <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> explicitly linked to the Australian Curriculum for each year level. Part 3 provides do-it-yourself curriculum design solutions followed by curriculum design templates which are also available on the associated website. The book uses the Understanding by Design approach with the three stages of curriculum design: identifying the desired results, determining the acceptable evidence of learning and planning learning experiences and instruction accordingly. The <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> for each year level have been designed using the 5 Es model for inquiry-based teaching: Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate and Evaluate...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{a system of}} t synchronous processes that communicate only by sending messages to one another, and that together must perform n independent <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> Processes may fail by crashing; we want to guarantee that in every execution of the protocol in which at least one process survives, all n <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> will be performed. We consider three parameters: the number of messages sent, the total number <b>of</b> <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> performed (including multiplicities), and time. We present three protocols for solving the problem. All three are work-optimal, doing O(n+t) work. The first has moderate costs in the remaining two parameters, sending O(t √ t) messages, and taking O(n + t) time. This protocol can be easily modified to run in any completely asynchronous system equipped with a failure detection mechanism. The second sends only O(tlog t) messages, but its running time is large (O(t 2 (n+t) 2 n+t)). The third is essentially time-optimal in the (usual) case {{in which there are}} no failures, and its time complexity degrades gracefully as the number of failures increases...|$|R

50|$|An {{execution}} model specifies how work takes place. Every {{programming language}} has an execution model, which is specified {{as part of}} the language specification, and is implemented {{as part of the}} language implementation. The details in the specification of an execution model cover things such as what is an indivisible <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> and what are the constraints on the order in which those units of work take place. For example, the addition operation is an indivisible <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> in many languages, and in sequential languages such units of work are constrained to take place one after the other.|$|E

40|$|Microarchitectures that {{implement}} conventional {{instruction set}} architectures are usuaHy limited {{in that they}} are only able to execute a small number of microoperations concur-rently. This limitation {{is due in part to}} the fact that the <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> that the hardware treats as indivisible are small. While this limitation is not important for microar-chitectures with a low level of functllonality, it can be sig-nificant’if the goal is to build hardware that can support a large number of microoperations executing concurrently. In this paper we address the tradeoffs associated with the sizes <b>of</b> the various <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> that a processor considers indi-visible, or atomic. We argue that by allowing larger <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> to be atomic, restrictions on concurrent operation are reduced and performance is increased. We outline the implement. ation of a front end for a dynamically scheduled processor with hardware support for large atomic units. We discuss tradeoffs in the design and show that with a modest investment in hardware, the run-time advantages <b>of</b> large atomic <b>units</b> can be realized without the need to alter the instruction set architecture. 1...|$|R
