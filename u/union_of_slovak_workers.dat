5000|$|Under Dubček's leadership, Slovakia {{began to}} evolve toward {{political}} liberalization. Because Novotný and his Stalinist predecessors had denigrated Slovak [...] "bourgeois nationalists", most notably Gustáv Husák and Vladimír Clementis, in the 1950s, the Slovak branch worked to promote Slovak identity. This mainly {{took the form}} of celebrations and commemorations, such as the 150th birthdays of 19th century leaders <b>of</b> the <b>Slovak</b> National Revival Ľudovít Štúr and Jozef Miloslav Hurban, the centenary of the Matica slovenská in 1963, and the twentieth anniversary <b>of</b> the <b>Slovak</b> National Uprising. At the same time, the political and intellectual climate in Slovakia became freer than that in the Czech Lands. [...] This was exemplified by the rising readership of Kultúrny život, the weekly newspaper <b>of</b> the <b>Union</b> <b>of</b> <b>Slovak</b> Writers, which published frank discussions of liberalization, federalization and democratization, written by the most progressive or controversial writers - both Slovak and Czech. Kultúrny život consequently became the first Slovak publication to gain a wide following among Czechs.|$|R

5000|$|In February 1942, Slovakia {{became the}} first Nazi ally to agree to deportations. The Nazis had asked for 20,000 young able-bodied Jews for labour duties. Tiso had hoped that {{compliance}} would aid in the return <b>of</b> 120,000 <b>Slovak</b> <b>workers</b> from Germany. Later in 1942, amid Vatican protests as news of {{the fate of the}} deportees filtered back, and the German advance into Russia was halted, Slovakia then {{became the first}} of Hitler's puppet states to shut down the deportations. One Jewish writer stated: By the end of June 1942, some 52,000 Slovak Jews had been deported, mainly to Auschwitz and to their death. Then, however, the deportations slowed to a standstill. The intervention of the Vatican, followed by the bribing <b>of</b> <b>Slovak</b> officials upon the initiative of a group of local Jews [...] "Working Group" [...] did eventually play a role ... That bribing the Slovaks contributed to a halt in the deportations for two years is most likely ... There are significant records showing that Slovak Jews originally were employed in the I.G.

40|$|The greater {{flamingos}} (Phoenicopterus roseus) {{are one of}} {{the most}} widespread bird species in zoological gardens and within the <b>Union</b> <b>of</b> Czech and <b>Slovak</b> Zoological Gardens they are the third most common. Nowadays they can be found in 11 Czech and 3 Slovak zoos. Although flamingos have been bred since 19 th century, it is still quite problematic. The successfulness of breeding depends on detailed knowledge of their biology and ethology. Basic information about these two disciplines can be found in the first part of this bachelor thesis together with breeding conditions recommended by foreign experts. Second part concentrates on description of breeding and reproductive indicators in individual zoos within the <b>Union</b> <b>of</b> Czech and <b>Slovak</b> Zoological Gardens and their subsequent evaluation. These data have been collected mostly during life visits of mentioned institutions. For successful breeding it is important that the flamingos are kept in numerous flocks and their gender ratio is balanced. Another thing that is needed is adequately large exhibit with water tank which provides sense of security. What is important next is optimally set food ration with enough carotin and also flying ability of males. Those with cropped wings have a smaller successfulness of copulation thus a smaller chance of egg fertilisation. The most suitable conditions for reproduction within the <b>Union</b> <b>of</b> Czech and <b>Slovak</b> Zoological Gardens has "Ohrada" zoo. The worst conditions, on the other hand, have "Chomutov" and "Plzeň" zoos where the flamingos are kept only for expositional purpose...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the role of}} the business cycle for the transitions <b>of</b> Czech and <b>Slovak</b> <b>workers</b> to informal economy using Czech and Slovak Labor Force Survey data. We use two approximations for the participation in informal economy, self-employment and employment in small workplace (10 and fewer workers or 5 and fewer workers). Both statuses are potentially associated with the participation in an informal economy. Using the similar methodology as presented in Bosh and Maloney (2007), we show that recent recession caused substantial increase in transitions of workers from formal into both self-employment and employment. As compare to pre-recession time the flow into self- increased more than 4 times. The increase in transitions to small workplaces is less pronounced.

The army as an organized unit already did not exist at that time and the order was not delivered to all troops because of missing communication lines.|$|R
