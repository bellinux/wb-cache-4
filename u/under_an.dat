40|$|Bar presses by {{one group}} of rats were {{conditioned}} <b>under</b> <b>a</b> differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate reinforcement schedule immediately prior to conditioning <b>under</b> <b>a</b> fixed-interval schedule. In a second group of rats, bar presses were conditioned first <b>under</b> <b>a</b> differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate schedule and then <b>under</b> <b>a</b> fixed-ratio schedule prior to conditioning <b>under</b> <b>a</b> fixed-interval schedule. Low response rates occurred under the fixed-interval schedule only when it was immediately preceded by low-rate conditioning. Otherwise, fixed-interval responding was similar to responding under the fixed-ratio schedule. This finding suggests that responses of laboratory animals are sensitive to immediate history, and, unlike human responses, are relatively insensitive to a history of low-rate conditioning when it is followed by high-rate conditioning...|$|R
