40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the {{presented}} in this work research was determining the limiting conditions of <b>upsetting</b> in three-slide forging press (TSFP). The free <b>upsetting</b> process and <b>upsetting</b> process in cylindrical impression were analyzed. Design/methodology/approach: The assumed purpose was confirmed in experimental research. For the case of <b>upsetting</b> in cylindrical impression, the research of limiting <b>upsetting</b> coefficients were made for different diameters and impression lengths. Findings: The obtained results showed large variety of limiting <b>upsetting</b> ratio depending on the analyzed impression geometrical parameters. It was stated, that there are 3 phenomena limiting the <b>upsetting</b> process in the die. The main phenomenon is the bar <b>upsetting</b> outside the impression. The <b>upsetting</b> processes in the impression are limited also by bar buckling outside the impression and overlapping inside the impressionResearch limitations/implications: The results of research allowed for stating that, besides the process geometrical parameters, friction conditions and type of the formed material influenced the limiting <b>upsetting</b> coefficients in the cylindrical impression. It is purposeful to make the further research determining quantitative and qualitative dependencies between these factors. Practical implications: The obtained results are the basis for designing of forming processes in TSFP in which the <b>upsetting</b> dominates. Especially it considers the elongated forgings and elongated preforms with thickeningsOriginality/value: The influence of the impression geometrical parameters on the limiting <b>upsetting</b> coefficients for the case of <b>upsetting</b> in cylindrical impression in TSFP has been analyzed in details. The dependencies, which should be used during designing of <b>upsetting</b> processes in TSFP were determined...|$|R
40|$|The {{electric}} <b>upsetting</b> {{process is}} an excellent electrically assisted preforming technique with electrical-thermal-mechanical multi-field coupling characteristic. The secondary <b>upsetting</b> defect in electric <b>upsetting</b> with inappropriate parameters combinations could result in folds in subsequent forging process. In order to analyze the formation process of the secondary <b>upsetting</b> defect, the finite element model of electric <b>upsetting</b> was constructed based on the multi-field coupling solver platform, MSC. Marc. It is concluded through the numerical simulation with inappropriate parameters combination that the main factor causing the secondary <b>upsetting</b> defect is the large temperature decrease of the deformed portion after the formation of drum-shape in the preliminary stage of electric <b>upsetting.</b> Subsequently, the secondary <b>upsetting</b> defect has been successfully avoided via a three-stage current mode. Finally, a novel optimization method based on close-cycle control of current in numerical simulation was established by developing a current subroutine in MSC.

In this paper, we compute the stationary probability of those <b>upsets</b> induced due to EMI by using parameters accounting for EMI behavior and the conditional probabilities of <b>upsets</b> in the presence of EMI. The latter represents susceptibility to EMI depending upon the electrical shielding properties of controllers against various intensities and frequencies of EMI.
