5|$|Two high-powered {{parliamentary}} commissions in 1852 issued {{recommendations for}} Oxford and Cambridge. Archibald Campbell Tait, former headmaster of Rugby School, {{was a key}} member of the Oxford Commission; he wanted Oxford to follow the German and Scottish model in which the professorship was paramount. The Commission's report envisioned a centralised university run predominantly by professors and faculties, with a much stronger emphasis on research. The professional staff should be strengthened and better paid. For students, restrictions on entry should be dropped, and more opportunity given to poorer families. It called for an enlargement of the curriculum, with honours to be awarded in many new fields. Undergraduate scholarships should be open to all Britons. Graduate fellowships should be opened <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> members of the University. It recommended that Fellows be released from an obligation for ordination. Students were {{to be allowed to}} save money by boarding in the city, instead of in a college.|$|E

25|$|So, {{among the}} readers of The Flapper, parts of them were celebrated for flappers' spirit and {{appropriation}} of male privilege, while parts of them acknowledged the dangers of emulating flappers too faithfully, with some even confessing to violating their own codes of ethics so as to live <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> the hype.|$|E

25|$|During the Roman period, {{the games}} were opened <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> {{citizens}} of the Roman Empire. A programme of new buildings and extensive repairs, including to the Temple of Zeus, took place. In 150 AD, the Nympheum (or Exedra) was built. New baths replaced the older Greek examples in 100 AD and an aqueduct constructed in 160 AD.|$|E
25|$|We {{have too}} many Jews in the towns. They are needed on the Polish border because in these areas Hebrews alone perform trade. As {{soon as you get}} away from the frontier, the Jews become a disadvantage, they form cliques, they deal in {{contraband}} and get <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> manner of rascally tricks which are detrimental to Christian burghers and merchants. I have never persecuted anyone from this or any other sect; I think, however, it would be prudent to pay attention, so that their numbers do not increase.|$|E
25|$|The {{forward section}} of the first Vista-Dome car was {{partitioned}} off and reserved for women and children. There was a door in the corridor under the dome just behind the women's restroom to the reserved section. Early on, this reserved section was opened <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> passengers and the door and partitions were removed. Ownership of the cars was split between the three railroads almost evenly across all car types. Each car was owned by one railroad, but the ownership of the cars in any one day's train depended more on what was available at the terminals than whose railroad the train was operating over.|$|E

25|$|Three-axis MEMS-based {{gyroscopes}} {{are also}} being used in portable electronic devices such as tablets, smartphones, and smartwatches. This adds to the 3-axis acceleration sensing ability available on previous generations of devices. Together these sensors provide 6 component motion sensing; acceleration for X,Y, and Z movement, and gyroscopes for measuring the extent and rate of rotation in space (roll, pitch and yaw). Some devices (e.g. the iPhone) additionally incorporate a magnetometer to provide absolute angular measurements relative to the Earth's magnetic field. Newer MEMS-based inertial measurement units incorporate <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> nine axes of sensing in a single integrated circuit package, providing inexpensive and widely available motion sensing.|$|E
25|$|For a decade, colleges had {{required}} {{science and}} engineering majors to take a course in computer programming, typically using the FORTRAN or BASIC languages. This meant there was a sizable customer base who knew about computers. In 1970, electronic calculators were not seen outside of a laboratory, but by 1974 they were a common household item. Calculators and video games like Pong introduced computer power to the general public. Electronics hobbyists were moving on to digital projects such as digital voltmeters and frequency counters. The Altair had enough power to be actually useful, and was designed as an expandable system that opened it <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> sorts of applications.|$|E
25|$|The {{vehicles}} used in {{the special}} challenge to reach the Pole were two 2006 Toyota Hilux double cab 3.0l diesel pickup trucks, one Toyota Land Cruiser 120 and a trailer, {{all of which were}} heavily modified by Arctic Trucks. The choice of the Hilux was due to its exceptional durability, as demonstrated in an earlier episode of Top Gear when during a series of challenges a 1988 Hilux was proven to be able to stand <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> the tests the presenters could throw at it without any parts needing to be replaced. One Hilux was rigged with cameras for the presenters, whilst the others were used by the film crew, two driver/repair experts, and one polar expert.|$|E

25|$|No-limit hold 'em {{has grown}} in {{popularity}} and is the form most commonly found in televised tournament poker and is the game played in the main event of the World Series of Poker. In no-limit hold 'em, players may bet or raise any amount over the minimum raise <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> of the chips the player has at the table (called an all-in bet). The minimum raise {{is equal to the}} size of the previous bet or raise. If someone wishes to re-raise, they must raise at least the amount of the previous raise. For example, if the big blind is $2 and there is a raise of $6 to a total of $8, a re-raise must be at least $6 more for a total of $14. If a raise or re-raise is all-in and does not equal the size of the previous raise (or half the size in some casinos), the initial raiser cannot re-raise again (in case there are other players also still in the game). In pot-limit hold 'em, the maximum raise is the current size of the pot (including the amount needed to call).|$|E
500|$|There {{are nine}} entrances at street level, leading to two {{separate}} fare control areas. The original street exit {{is in the}} middle of the platforms with a separate fare control mezzanine above the tracks, and the 24-hour station agent's booth. Staircases lead <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> four corners of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue. The new fare control area at Lippmann Plaza has an extremely high ceiling, with the lobby itself located approximately [...] below the street level. The mezzanine is at platform level, and provides an ADA-compliant elevator, three unidirectional escalators, and a stairway to street level at Lippmann Plaza. New artwork titled Happy World was installed over the row of turnstiles in 1998. The plaza, also known as Lippmann Arcade, is a pedestrian walkway that leads to a municipal parking lot and several bus stops on 39th Avenue.|$|E
500|$|Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama {{praised the}} variety of genres present in the soundtrack {{and the lack of}} remixes. He gave it an overall rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars, calling it a [...] "zero {{compromise}} album" [...] that [...] "stays true to the film's spirit". Planet Bollywood's Atta Khan rated it 9 out of 10, noting that the soundtrack [...] "unquestionably lives <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> expectations". He felt that it maintained an [...] "all round polished nature" [...] and [...] "is destined to become a classic". Although he, too, enjoyed the musical variety, he believed the composers overused the guitar and synthesizers. Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave the soundtrack a score of 3 out of 5, commenting, [...] "Taare Zameen Par isn't your regular soundtrack about fluttering hearts and sleepless nights. What makes these delicate and whimsical creations special is their underlying innocence." [...] According to the Indian trade website Box Office India, with around 11,00,000 units sold, this film's soundtrack album was the year's thirteenth highest-selling.|$|E

500|$|In January 1916, Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer became {{commander}} in chief of the High Seas Fleet. Following the Battle of Jutland on 31 May– 1 June 1916, Scheer pushed for new, more powerful battleships.

After the outbreak of unrestricted submarine warfare in February 1917, Admiral von Capelle argued that capital ship construction should not be halted in favor of U-boat construction. On 21 August 1917, the construction department submitted two design proposals for the new battleship class, L 20 and L 24. The primary difference was the placement of the ships' torpedo armament. The L 20 design placed them in the hull below the waterline, while the L 24 proposal used above-water launchers. Displacement for the designs was fixed at [...] Both ships also had a top speed of only , which was unacceptable to Scheer.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five and wrote that the installment's return to the black oil mythos seemed [...] "out of date". They also wrote that Mulder and Doggett are [...] "good at running away, which doesn't give either of them much dignity." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a {{negative}} review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. She wrote, [...] "as action-adventure, 'Veinen' is so-so. Except for the big 'money shot' explosion at the end, it doesn't exploit the possibilities of the physical location." [...] Meghan Deans of Tor.com ultimately concluded that [...] "while 'Vienen' works hard to hit its marks—a classic villain, a battle of dudes—it can’t measure <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> that’s come before it." [...] She surmised that [...] "the transfer [...] is functional, but the transfer is hollow." [...] She did, however, applaud {{the return of the}} black oil, noting that she was [...] "happy to have it back." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{special feature}} of Formula E is the [...] "Fan Boost" [...] feature, an {{additional}} 100 kilowatts (130 hp) {{of power to}} use in the driver's second car. The three drivers who were allowed to use the boost were determined by a fan vote. For the Buenos Aires race, Buemi, di Grassi and Abt were handed the extra power. Weather conditions {{at the start of the}} race were dry and sunny with an air temperature ranging from [...] and a track temperature of a 90 percent chance of rain was forecast. 21,000 people attended the race. The race began at 16:00 Argentina Time (...) [...] When the race started, di Grassi maintained his pole position advantage heading into the first turn. Vergne fended off an attempt by Buemi to keep second place. Rosenqvist made a fast getaway, overtaking Evans and Prost and challenged Piquet for fifth position. The full course yellow was necessitated when Carroll was unable to move off his starting position but was able to restart his car as the field approached to lap him, and was ordered by his team to catch <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> the drivers but was required to abide by the full course yellow speed limit.
