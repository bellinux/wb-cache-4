The company has prioritized to invest significant amounts in the replacement of older electrical facilities, capacity expansion etc. These development measures are expected {{to result in a}} more sustainable power system network. However, the goal of achieving the highest possible power supply reliability is still challenged {{by the fact that it}} is often difficult to determine the underlying causes for outages or when and where they are expected to happen, which in turn complicates the optimization process. This report aims at conducting a study on the variation in the start time of <b>unplanned</b> <b>outages.</b> The study is divided into different sections. A comparison between the power outage statistics of Ellevio and the total of Sweden is done in order to identify common and deviant trends. This is followed by a data analysis to study the most common underlying reasons for <b>unplanned</b> <b>outages</b> as well as determine the connections between observed outage trends and other factors, internal and external.

40|$|An <b>unplanned</b> <b>outage</b> can {{be costly}} for a utility, and gas {{turbines}} are expensive pieces of equipment to repair or replace. It is therefore vital that anomalous behaviour is flagged before damage can occur that may cause a prolonged outage.

The proposed system incorporates machine learning algorithms based on artificial neural networks (ANN). By using ANNs trained on normal plant behaviour, {{it is possible to}} identify anomalous behaviour by the high residuals between actual and predicted outputs.

30|$|The model {{offers two}} merit-order approaches: either based on {{marginal}} costs, or the merit-order {{can be assigned}} by the user based on user assumptions or preferences. Because we want to explore potential consequences of differential implementation of the PHS plants to the electricity system, this last approach is {{used in this study}} (see Section  2.3. 1). The defined power plants are placed in order of the merit (see Table  2 and Appendix A). Within each defined type of plant, the newest plant is placed higher in the merit order. The last option is by changing the plants’ typical label (base, middle or peak load). For example, if a new highly efficient, cleaner combined cycle (CC)-plant should be placed higher in the merit order then an old coal-fired power station, the CC-plants’ label could become “Base Load” while the coal-fired power plants’ label becomes “Middle Load”. In this case the CC-plant is placed higher in the merit order.

30|$|In {{regulated}} markets with time-of-day pricing, {{the price is}} deterministic. Even in de{{regulated markets}}, (Davison et al.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic programming (DP) model {{of an electric}} utility's optimal policy for operating {{a nuclear power plant}} (NPP). The utility chooses the level of capacity utilization of the NPP as a function of signals about the NPP's current operating state. In each period the utility must determine whether or not to operate the reactor, or shut it down for preventive maintenance or refueling, or to permanently close the plant. Maintenance performed during periodic refueling outages partially ``regenerates'' the NPP, reducing the risk of <b>unplanned</b> forced <b>outages</b> in succeeding periods. Using monthly data on U. S. NPPs in the post-TMI era we estimate parameters of the utility's profit function, the failure processes that lead to <b>unplanned</b> forced <b>outages,</b> and the parameters governing the duration of refueling outages. These parameters imply an endogenous distribution of operating spells and capacity utilization levels that depend on the NPP's age, signals the operator receives about the NPP's current operating state, and the duration since last refueling. The estimates of the DP model reveal that utilities appear responsive to NRC regulation insofar as they impute a very high cost to <b>unplanned</b> and forced <b>outages.</b> Utilities are also highly averse to causing unnecessary wear and tear on their NPP's caused by stop/start operation of their NPP's including planned and <b>unplanned</b> <b>outages.</b> Overall, the DP model yields very accurate predictions of nuclear power generation including the impact of the relatively rare event of NPP decommissionings. ...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, the {{trade-off}} between quality {{and cost of}} power system components has {{become a matter of}} interest for many utilities. The widespread use of costly electricity networks either in residential or industrial areas has encouraged service providers to find a proper strategy that will minimize the overall life-cycle cost while keeping components in good working condition. The power transformer, which represents approximately 60 % of the overall cost of the network, is ranked {{as one of the most}} important and expensive components. However, the transformer's sudden failure puts the system in a serious or critical condition which in most cases causes catastrophic loss to both utilities and customers. Significant attention has been given to monitoring and diagnostic techniques that observe any abnormal behaviour, assess the transformer's condition, and therefore minimize the probability of <b>unplanned</b> <b>outage.</b> Yet, applying many various monitoring tests is not always applicable due to the following factors: some tests require the unit to be taken out from service for testing, insufficient availability of man power, and significant cost of applying all the tests. Thus, there is a vital demand for an intelligent method of minimizing the number of monitoring tests without losing much information about the transformer's actual condition. In this research, data mining techniques have been employed to evaluate the transformer's state through intelligent selection criteria that determines the optimal number of monitoring tests in cost-effectiveness. Feature selection technique based on ranker search method has been used to rank the monitoring tests (features) in a priority sequence from their individual evaluation, and to select the most inductive tests that provide the most information about the unit's condition. When the measured data from monitoring tests is collected and prepared, a diagnostic technique is applied to assess the condition of the transformer. In this regard, Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been utilized to perform this task due to its robust classification accuracy. SVM is first applied to the full number of tests, and then the number of monitoring tests is reduced by one after each classification process using the feature selection algorithm. The selected number of monitoring tests has shown the best possible accuracy the classifier can reach over the whole number of tests. Radial Basis Function (RBF) classifier has been used in the classification process for results comparison purposes. This proposed work contributes towards finding an intelligent method of evaluating the transformer state as well as minimizing the number of tests without losing much information about the unit's actual condition. Therefore, this method facilitates deciding a wise course of action regarding the transformer: either maintain, repair, or replace...|$|E

40|$|Japan has {{recently}} been urged to implement measures to increase utility factors for nuclear power plants {{in order to address}} energy security and greenhouse gas emission cuts. The average utility factor for Japan's nuclear power plants in 2009 rose from 58. 0 % in 2008 to 64. 7 %, still below levels in other major nuclear power generation countries including South Korea and the United States. Some major foreign nuclear power generation countries have kept their utility factors for nuclear plants at high levels at or above 90 % since 1990, while others including the United States and South Korea have raised their respective factors since 2000 following the 1990 s when their factors were close to the Japanese level. The latter group made ambitious efforts to raise these factors. Specifically, the United States has shortened planned outage time for periodic maintenance and repairs of nuclear power plants year by year as the nuclear industry and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission have tried to take advantage of risk information for optimizing instrument-by-instrument inspection frequencies and for expanding the scope for preventive maintenance during operation (PMO). <b>Unplanned</b> <b>outage</b> time to solve nuclear plant instrument issue has also been shortened substantially thanks to the reduction of the trouble incidence rate and shorter repair and restart times. The United States has also tried to lengthen operational cycle periods, adopting 18 -to- 24 -month cycles for many plants. In a bid to shorten plant outage time, South Korea has promoted not only the improvement of operational skills and the introduction of sophisticated instruments but also the enhancement of maintenance know-how including the reform of maintenance and repair processes and the improvement of inspection work steps. Overseas cases for the restart of nuclear plant operations from an unplanned plant outage include those in multiple countries in which thorough investigations into minor troubles or measures for their future prevention were not necessarily required for restarting plants. As far as our analysis generally indicates, local governments are not authorized to examine nuclear plant safety in foreign countries. An apparent dominant view in foreign countries is that it would be reasonable to utilize infrastructure as much as possible once safety regulation authorities conclude that a plant restart would have no safety problems. As existing nuclear power plants have been required to be effectively utilized under the top priority on safety, some countries have continuously achieved high utility factors for nuclear plants, between 85 % and 95 % over 10 to 20 years while meeting safety standards at the same level as in Japan. In considering specific measures to effectively utilize existing nuclear reactors, Japan should take full account of these overseas efforts and promote discussions on overall Japanese nuclear energy and safety approaches. nuclear power, Japan, utility factor...|$|E

The application of fault detection and identification helps to identify the presence of faults to improve mission success or increase up-time of plant equipment. Implementation of such systems can take the form of pattern recognition, statistical and geometric classifiers, soft computing methods or complex model based methods. This study deals with the latter, and focuses on a specific type of model, the Kalman filter. The Kalman filter is an observer which estimates the states of a system, i. e. the physical variables, based upon its current state and knowledge of its inputs. This relies upon the creation of a mathematical model of the system in order to predict the outputs of the system at any given time. Feedback from the plant corrects minor deviation between the system and the Kalman filter model. Comparison between this prediction of outputs and the real output provides the indication of the presence of a fault. On systems with several inputs and outputs banks of these filters can used in order to detect and isolate the various faults that occur in the process and its sensors and actuators. The thesis examines the application of the diagnostic techniques to a laboratory scale aircraft fuel system test-rig. The first stage of the research project required the development of a mathematical model of the fuel rig. Test data acquired by experiment is used to validate the system model against the fuel rig. This nonlinear model is then simplified to create several linear state space models of the fuel rig. These linear models are then used to develop the Kalman filter Fault Detection and Identification (FDI) system by application of appropriate tuning of the Kalman filter gains and careful choice of residual thresholds to determine fault condition boundaries and logic to identify the location of the fault. Additional performance enhancements are also achieved by implementation of statistical evaluation of the residual signal produced and by automatic threshold calculation. The results demonstrate the positive capture of a fault condition and identification of its location in an aircraft fuel system test-rig. The types of fault captured are hard faults such sensor malfunction and actuator failure which provide great deviation of the residual signals and softer faults such as performance degradation and fluid leaks in the tanks and pipes. Faults of a smaller magnitude are captured very well albeit within a larger time range. The performance of the Fault Diagnosis and Identification was further improved by the implementation of statistically evaluating the residual signal and by the development of automatic threshold determination.
