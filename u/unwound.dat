5|$|The RNAi pathway {{is found}} in many eukaryotes, {{including}} animals, and is initiated by the enzyme Dicer, which cleaves long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules into short double-stranded fragments of ~20 nucleotide siRNAs. Each siRNA is <b>unwound</b> into two single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs), the passenger strand and the guide strand. The passenger strand is degraded and the guide strand is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The most well-studied outcome is post-transcriptional gene silencing, which occurs when the guide strand pairs with a complementary sequence in a messenger RNA molecule and induces cleavage by Argonaute 2 (Ago2), the catalytic component of the RISC complex. In some organisms, this process spreads systemically, despite the initially limited molar concentrations of siRNA.|$|E

The game would, for the next year, only be mentioned by Nintendo in passing during an interview involving the Nintendo DSi XL, where it {{was referred to as}} Professor Layton and the Specter's Flute. At the end of May 2011, Level-5 filed a trademark in the United States for Professor Layton and the Last Specter, and {{the game was}} officially unveiled internationally following E3 2011.

5|$|Silkworms, the {{caterpillars}} and pupae of {{the moth}} Bombyx mori, have been reared to produce silk in China from the Neolithic Yangshao period onwards, c. 5000 BC. Production spread to India by 140 AD. The caterpillars are fed on mulberry leaves. The cocoon, produced after the fourth moult, {{is covered with}} a continuous filament of the silk protein, fibroin, gummed together with sericin. In the traditional process, the gum is removed by soaking in hot water, and the silk is then <b>unwound</b> from the cocoon and reeled. Filaments are spun together to make silk thread. Commerce in silk between China and countries to its west began in ancient times, with silk known from an Egyptian mummy of 1070 BC, and later to the ancient Greeks and Romans. The silk road leading west from China was opened in the second century AD, helping to drive trade in silk and other goods.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE. TO {{evaluate}} {{the expression of}} tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) mRNA in corneal tissues before and at early time points (6 and 12 hours and 1, 3, and 5 days) after corneal infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. METHODS. Ribonuclease protection assays were used to detect and quantitate TIMP mRNA expression in uninfected (wounded and <b>unwounded)</b> and in wounded corneas inoculated with P. aeruginosa. RESULTS. Expression of TIMP- 1 mRNA was undetectable in either wounded or <b>unwounded,</b> uninfected corneal tissues, but it increased in a time-dependent manner with peak expression occurring at 3 days after corneal wounding and bacterial inoculation. Constitutive low-level mRNA expression of TIMP- 2 was detected in both groups of uninfected corneal tissues; these groups remained essentially unchanged after corneal abrasion and bacterial inoculation. TIMP- 3 mRNA was detected in uninfected (wounded and <b>unwounded)</b> corneal tissues and appeared to decrease in a timedependent manner after corneal abrasion and bacterial inoculation. CONCLUSIONS. The evidence indicated that TlMPs were expressed in infected and in uninfected (wounded and <b>unwounded)</b> corneal tissues.

These three polymerases are essential for viability of the cell.|$|E

25|$|Initiation of {{eukaryotic}} DNA replication is {{the first}} stage of DNA synthesis where the DNA double helix is <b>unwound</b> and an initial priming event by DNA polymerase α occurs on the leading strand.

Priming occurs once at the origin on the leading strand and at the start of each Okazaki fragment on the lagging strand.|$|E

25|$|In G1 {{phase of}} the cell cycle, many of the DNA {{replication}} regulatory processes are initiated. In eukaryotes, {{the vast majority of}} DNA synthesis occurs during S {{phase of the}} cell cycle, and the entire genome must be <b>unwound</b> and duplicated to form two daughter copies. During G2, any damaged DNA or replication errors are corrected. Finally, one copy of the genomes is segregated to each daughter cell at mitosis or M phase. These daughter copies each contain one strand from the parental duplex DNA and one nascent antiparallel strand.|$|E
25|$|Topoisomerase inhibitors are {{drugs that}} affect the {{activity}} of two enzymes: topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II. When the DNA double-strand helix is <b>unwound,</b> during DNA replication or transcription, for example, the adjacent unopened DNA winds tighter (supercoils), like opening {{the middle of a}} twisted rope. The stress caused by this effect is in part aided by the topoisomerase enzymes. They produce single- or double-strand breaks into DNA, reducing the tension in the DNA strand. This allows the normal unwinding of DNA to occur during replication or transcription. Inhibition of topoisomerase I or II interferes with both of these processes.|$|E

The cable was rewound once or twice a day. On October 10, 1956, the weight came loose from the cable and plunged through two floors (narrowly avoiding killing a man, who had just gotten up from his desk). The mechanical clock was later replaced with an electric one.|$|E
25|$|Remedies {{are partly}} {{regulated}} by the Misrepresentation Act 1967.

In this case the misrepresentee can equally sue for damages as if the misrepresentation had been true. A misrepresentee may also sue for any losses due to relying on the misrepresentation.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{replication}} is {{the action}} of DNA polymerases synthesizing a DNA strand complementary to the original template strand. To synthesize DNA, the double-stranded DNA is <b>unwound</b> by DNA helicases ahead of polymerases, forming a replication fork containing two single-stranded templates. Replication processes permit the copying of a single DNA double helix into two DNA helices, which are divided into the daughter cells at mitosis. The major enzymatic functions carried out at the replication fork are well conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, but the replication machinery in eukaryotic DNA replication is a much larger complex, coordinating many proteins {{at the site of}} replication, forming the replisome.|$|E
