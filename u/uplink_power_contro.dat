40|$|Abstract — Ranging {{process in}} IEEE 802. 16 system {{provides}} {{a number of}} functionalities such as initial network entry, <b>uplink</b> synchronization, <b>power</b> adjustment, and system coordination. As the introduction of relay network in IEEE 802. 16 systems, a new transmission power control algorithm is necessary. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel ranging transmission power control algorithm which reduces the interference between MS-BS ranging (i. e. ranging between MS and BS) and MS-RS ranging (i. e. ranging between MS and RS). Computer simulation results show the performance of ranging process in terms of ranging detection success probability and validate {{the efficiency of the}} proposed transmission power control algorithm. These results will be beneficial as the guideline for the design of IEEE 802. 16 relay system. Keywords-component; IEEE 802. 16; Ranging; Relay; Transmission <b>power</b> <b>contro...</b>|$|R

Additionally, adaptive OL-PC improves {{the capacity of}} both macro- and femtocells by setting the open-loop parameter based on the average received SINR and the uplink interference caused by neighboring cells. The proposed PHR-based <b>uplink</b> <b>power</b> control scheme is verified by system-level simulation. The simulation results for the proposed PHR-PERA scheme with conventional OL-PC shows a remarkable increase of approximately 49.9  % in macrocell capacity and 5  % in femtocell capacity.

We first model the <b>uplink</b> <b>power</b> and subchannel allocation in femtocells as a non-cooperative game, where inter-cell interference is taken into account in maximizing femtocell capacity and uplink interference from femto users to the macrocell is alleviated by charging each femto user a price proportional to the amount of interference that it causes to the macrocell. Based on the non-cooperative game, we then devise a semi-distributed algorithm for each femtocell to first assign subchannels to femto users and then allocate power to subchannels accordingly. Simulation comparisons with existing unpriced subchannel assignment and modified iterative water filling (MIWF)-based power allocation algorithms show that the proposed interference-aware femtocell uplink resource allocation algorithm is able to provide improved capacities for not only femtocells, but also the macrocell, as well as comparable or even better tiered fairness in a co-channel two-tier network.|$|R
