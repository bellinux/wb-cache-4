It was found that <b>urban</b> traffic <b>noise</b> depends on the logarithmic functions of the hourly traffic flow (logQ), the number of heavy vehicles (logHV) and the average speed of vehicles (logV). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's studentized method confirmed that the hourly traffic flow {{and the number of}} heavy vehicles are the most significant factors in <b>urban</b> traffic <b>noise.</b> The {{regression model}} was analyzed using scattering diagrams and compared with the widely used CRTN model. Results show that the regression model would give an accurate prediction in an urban area with tall buildings and a high proportion of heavy vehicles (weight exceeding 1, 525 kg). The statistical frequency distribution of <b>urban</b> traffic <b>noise</b> was obtained based on the noise levels measured in the winter months of 2000. It was found that <b>urban</b> traffic <b>noise</b> is characterized by chi-squared distributions with a degree of freedom of 6 for interrupted traffic flow and with a different dof of 12 for free traffic flow.

40|$|Urbanization {{leads to}} {{structural}} changes to habitats and introduction of anthropogenic noise, {{both of which}} can interfere with avian communication. While studies suggest that birds can adjust their vocal behaviour in response to <b>urban</b> <b>noise,</b> the relative effects of urban habitat structure vs. noise on avian communication are not well understood. Further, understanding which species can adjust to noise and the mechanisms they use to achieve this can help conservation efforts predict which species will be most negatively affected by increasing urbanization. Species that possess certain vocal attributes (e. g., repertoires {{or the ability to}} learn new songs types) may be more or less able to adjust to <b>urban</b> <b>noise.</b> Here, I investigate how two closely related species (mountain chickadees Poecile gambeli and black-capped chickadees Poecile atricapillus) adjust their vocalizations in response to noise.

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that bird songs are {{modified}} in different {{ways to deal with}} <b>urban</b> <b>noise</b> and promote signal transmission through noisy environments. <b>Urban</b> <b>noise</b> is composed of low frequencies, thus the observation that songs have a higher minimum frequency in noisy places suggests this is a way of avoiding noise masking. Most studies are correlative and there is as yet little experimental evidence that this is a short-term mechanism owing to individual plasticity. Here we experimentally test if house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) can modulate the minimum frequency of their songs in response to different noise levels. We exposed singing males to three continuous treatments: low–high–low noise levels. We found a significant increase in minimum frequency from low to high and a decrement from high to low treatments. We also found that this was mostly achieved by modifying the frequency of the same low-frequency syllable types used in the different treatments. When different low-frequency syllables were used, those sung during the noisy condition were longer than the ones sang during the quiet condition. We conclude that house finches modify their songs in several ways in response to <b>urban</b> <b>noise,</b> thus providing evidence of a short-term acoustic adaptation...|$|E
40|$|Noise is {{a global}} problem. In 1972 the World Health Organization (WHO) {{classified}} noise as a pollutant. Since then, most industrialized countries have enacted laws and local regulations to prevent and reduce acoustic environmental pollution. A further aim is to alert people {{to the dangers of}} this type of pollution. In this context, urban planners need to have tools that allow them to evaluate the degree of acoustic pollution. Scientists in many countries have modeled <b>urban</b> <b>noise,</b> using a wide range of approaches, but their results have not been as good as expected. This paper describes a model developed for the prediction of environmental <b>urban</b> <b>noise</b> using Soft Computing techniques, namely Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in acoustic monitoring systems {{make it possible}} to measure complex <b>noise</b> situations, like <b>urban</b> traffic <b>noise,</b> continuously. Monitoring provides more insight in the noise situation, from which more specific and (cost) effective measures can be taken.

However, continuously monitoring with high sample rates results in large quantities of data, which need to be processed to obtain the relevant information. Intelligent onboard processing is an efficient way of dealing with this issue. Additionally, onboard processing results in less data communication which is often a of practical relevance.

40|$|International audienceIncreasing {{levels of}} {{anthropogenic}} noise represent {{a challenge for}} animals living in urban areas and birds, especially, may suffer from noisy conditions as they use singing to attract mates. Most anthropogenic noise is low in frequency and singing at high frequencies under noisy urban conditions may avoid masking and thus be a good strategy for breeding success in cities. Despite comparative, correlational and some experimental studies supporting this hypothesis, empirical studies {{on the impact of}} noise on sexual behaviour are largely lacking. Domestic canaries, Serinus canaria, provide an excellent model system to test unequivocal sexual responsiveness as receptive females perform copulation solicitation displays (CSD) to male song. We have previously shown that CSD rate was higher for low- than for high-frequency songs. In the current study, we tested whether a typical <b>urban</b> <b>noise</b> spectrum, with a bias towards low frequencies, could undermine sexual preferences. Using overlapping and alternating noise exposure regimes while broadcasting male songs we found that masking by <b>urban</b> <b>noise</b> reduced female responsiveness to low-frequency attractive songs. Under the same conditions the responsiveness to high-frequency songs remained unaffected and, consequently, the sexual preference for low- over high-frequency songs had faded because of the <b>urban</b> <b>noise.</b> We discuss to what extent our results can be extrapolated to other wild bird species and speculate about the adaptive value of the typical upward shift in frequency found in many city birds...|$|E

40|$|Engine {{noise is}} one of the most {{critical}} <b>noises</b> in <b>urban</b> <b>noises.</b> NVH improvements are essential in order to fulfill various noise emission regulations such as ISO 362. Reducing engine noise has become a necessity for engine developers. Measurement plays an important role beside the simulations to improve the NVH behavior, because the engine is a rather complicated mechanical system with many components. ISO 3745 is an ideal method for sound power measurement for internal combustion engines since it provides a fast measurement through many different engine speeds. However room as well as the measurement method, should comply with this standard. Because of the size and installation situation for a running engine there is limited space for measurement; and it is difficult to reach standards requirements especially for such a directive sound source. The difficulty to meet these requirements also applies to Scania's anechoic room.

40|$|Problem statement: The {{problem of}} <b>urban</b> traffic <b>noise</b> {{pollution}} is universal {{and in the}} past few decades it has grown to the point that it has become a major concern for both the public and the policy-makers. Approach: In a comprehensive 18 month research project, traffic-generated noise was monitored at 47 roadway locations in fourteen districts in metropolitan Kuwait in 2004 - 2005. Simultaneously with noise, traffic flow variables of volume-by mix and traffic speed were also measured. Measurements of noise and traffic flow variables were performed for a period of 20 min at each location, repeated 3 - 5 times, during peak and off-peak hours to account for time-fluctuation of these variables. At each district, a sample of freeway, arterial, collector and local residential streets were included in the noise and traffic flow monitoring plan. In addition to the analysis of noise, flow and their interrelationships, two models-regressions and the FHWAs traffic noise model, were employed to predict noise pollutions from traffic. Results: Findings indicated that traffic noise is at or above, the standard outdoor limits in most locations and especially at arterial roadways and freeways. Recommendations concerning measured to improve the problem of <b>urban</b> traffic <b>noise</b> pollution in Kuwait are also made. Conclusion: Findings of this research project had shown that level of traffic-generated noise pollution in Kuwait urban area is high enough to adversely affect the welfare activities and productivities of its residents.
