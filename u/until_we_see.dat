2500|$|Like earlier {{influential}} Islamist Sayyid Qutb, Azzam {{urged the}} creation of a [...] "pioneering vanguard", as the core of a new Islamic society. [...] "This vanguard constitutes the solid base [...] for the hoped-for society ... We shall continue the jihad no matter how long the way, until the last breath and the last beat of the pulse - or <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> the Islamic state [...] established." ...|$|E
2500|$|And [...] when Moses {{said to his}} people, [...] "O my people, indeed {{you have}} wronged yourselves by your taking of the calf [...] So repent to your Creator and kill yourselves. That is best for [...] you {{in the sight of}} your Creator." [...] Then He {{accepted}} your repentance; indeed, He is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful. And [...] when you said, [...] "O Moses, we will never believe you <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> Allah outright"; so the thunderbolt took you while you were looking on.|$|E
2500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Roth Cornet of IGN gave the episode an 8 out of 10, saying [...] "The Walking Dead {{took a moment}} to remind us that there is – figuratively and literally – a {{light at the end of}} the tunnel after last week’s grim events. The intention seems to be to present us with the notion that there is, perhaps, such a thing as a happy ending just as we head into the season closer. The bright and shiny Stepford Wives feel of Terminus may be bit manufactured, but we won’t really know if this was the set up for a sucker-punch <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> the events of next week’s “A” play out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{must wait}} <b>until</b> <b>we</b> have <b>seen</b> him," [...] was Peter's judicious view. [...] "I {{should be so}} glad {{to think that the}} dear lady was happy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good tidings, indeed!" [...] exclaimed Issachar, [...] "and never shall I know a {{peaceful}} hour <b>until</b> <b>we</b> have <b>seen</b> {{the last of}} the towers of this doomed city and its accursed people of devil-worshippers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may just}} as well be {{pleasant}} over it," [...] said Mrs. Tipping, severely; [...] "because we sha’n’t go away <b>until</b> <b>we</b> have <b>seen</b> him. After all, it’s {{got nothing to do}} with you." ...|$|R
2500|$|Groucho and Chico briefly {{appeared}} {{together in}} a 1957 short film promoting The Saturday Evening Post entitled [...] "Showdown at Ulcer Gulch," [...] directed by animator Shamus Culhane, Chico's son-in-law. Groucho, Chico, and Harpo worked together (in separate scenes) in The Story of Mankind (1957). In 1959, the three began production of Deputy Seraph, a TV series starring Harpo and Chico as blundering angels, and Groucho (in every third episode) as their boss, the [...] "Deputy Seraph." [...] The project was abandoned when Chico {{was found to be}} uninsurable (and incapable of memorizing his lines) due to severe arteriosclerosis. On March 8 of that year, Chico and Harpo starred as bumbling thieves in The Incredible Jewel Robbery, a half-hour pantomimed episode of the General Electric Theater on CBS. Groucho made a cameo appearance—uncredited, because of constraints in his NBC contract—in the last scene, and delivered the only line of dialogue ("We won't talk <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> our lawyer!").|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{get that}} topsail {{up from the}} sail locker. We won't shift jibs just yet, <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> whether the breeze is going to freshen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Louisa, I {{will take}} {{particular}} heed {{of what you}} have said, and will be mum as a mouse, <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> how the cat jumps." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We promised {{ourselves}} not to {{be afraid}} of any ghost," [...] put in little Giant. [...] "I, for one, don't believe in turning back <b>until</b> <b>we</b> have <b>seen</b> and heard these things for ourselves." ...|$|R
60|$|Then came a {{sheet of}} flame which lighted up {{surrounding}} objects <b>until</b> <b>we</b> could distinctly <b>see</b> {{the deck of the}} bomb-vessel, and the eager men thronging her deck.|$|R
6000|$|... "He did {{not know}} that his mother was still in New Orleans. And when we told him how ill she was he would have come to her then. It was as much as we could do to persuade him to wait <b>until</b> <b>we</b> had <b>seen</b> Monsieur de Carondelet. Mr. Ritchie and I came {{directly}} to town and saw his Excellency." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Hold on!” he cautioned, as {{the driver}} reached out toward the horn. “Let her go <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> who they are. I suppose there’s no way round?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Get {{into the}} car, father," [...] said the girl, with a laugh. [...] "You mustn't forget you're the people's warden. Good-bye, Ralph, <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> {{you at the}} chalet." ...|$|E
60|$|Telegraph us {{your address}} at once, day message. Keep {{telegraphing}} every ten minutes {{at our expense}} <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> you. Will start on first train after receiving your wire.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{brothers}} are, {{and have}} been kinder than I dared to expect. It was thought better to tell no one else <b>until</b> <b>we</b> could <b>see</b> our way; {{but you have a}} right to know now, and I have the more hope that you will find comfort in the arrangement, since I know how warmly and gratefully she feels towards you. I may tell her?' he added, with a good deal of affirmation in his question.|$|R
60|$|Vive l'Empereur! Let him {{live for}} an hundred days, while we forget our enthusiasm and Europe prepares its final {{crushing}} blow. Let him live <b>until</b> <b>we</b> remember {{once again the}} horrors of war, the misery, the famine, the devastated homes! <b>until</b> once more <b>we</b> <b>see</b> the maimed and crippled crawling back wearily from the fields of glory, until our ears ring with the wails of widows and {{the cries of the}} fatherless.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{will not}} be deserted by us, aunty, <b>until</b> <b>we</b> shall <b>see</b> {{occasion}} to do so. Why not endeavour {{to get on board}} of yonder ship, and return to New York in her; or at least induce her captain to put us ashore somewhere near this, and go home by land. Your health never seemed better than it is at this moment; and as for mine, I do assure you, aunty, dear, I am as perfectly well as I ever was in my life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon not, lad. We {{must wait}} <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> {{what sort of}} place Harry is in, {{and how we can}} best help him, before we fix on any scheme." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go to {{the western}} turret," [...] said the Lady, [...] "and remain there in ward <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> how this gear will terminate. I know thy {{resolved}} disposition--thou wilt not attempt escape." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said doubtfully, [...] "I can't refuse you shelter. You {{can stay}} for a while, anyway, <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> how we get on. I'll {{go up to the}} {{homestead}} with you." ...|$|E
50|$|Over {{the years}} the {{population}} has fluctuated, starting off at 181 people in 1801 when first recorded in the census, this dropped significantly in 1811 to 139 people. However, by 1821 this had risen back {{to a high of}} 202 people. This stayed stable <b>until</b> 1901 when <b>we</b> <b>see</b> another dip to a 145 people.|$|R
2500|$|In November 2013, Mari Yamaguchi {{reported}} for Associated Press {{that there are}} computer simulations which suggest that [...] "the melted fuel in Unit 1, whose core damage was the most extensive, has breached {{the bottom of the}} primary containment vessel and even partially eaten into its concrete foundation, coming within about 30 centimeters (one foot) of leaking into the ground" [...] – a Kyoto University nuclear engineer said with regards to these estimates: [...] "We just can't be sure <b>until</b> <b>we</b> actually <b>see</b> the inside of the reactors." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Be wary, Leon, {{and speak}} less loudly, for <b>until</b> <b>we</b> have <b>seen</b> your mother <b>we</b> should keep {{ourselves}} secret. As {{to the red}} galleys they are indeed as large as any, for they are the Imperial ships of war, which come forth from the harbour of Theodosius. Round yonder green point is the Golden Horn, where the merchant ships are moored. But now, Leon, {{if you follow the}} line of buildings past the great church, you will see a long row of pillars fronting the sea. It marks the Palace of the Caesars." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we won't quarrel {{about that}} <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> {{how it all}} turns out. It may not be worth my time up here. I shall charge you roundly as your lawyer; depend on that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You mustn't {{be getting}} excited, Uncle John, <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> how this {{wonderful}} adventure turns out." [...] she said. [...] "But I really must wash and iron that necktie for you, if you're {{going to wear}} it on Sundays." ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS MARCH. Well, then, Cook {{will show}} you where things are kept, and how to lay the table and that. Your wages will be thirty <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> where we are. Every other Sunday, and Thursday afternoon. What about dresses? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hardly know}} myself," [...] Nat laughed, {{as they sat}} {{together}} in the cabin after dinner. [...] "Except when I was on the sick list, {{this is my first}} experience of not having a night watch to keep. However, I expect I shall be up and down, and at any rate call me if there is the slightest change in the weather. We know what she can do in a light wind now, but we won't risk anything <b>until</b> <b>we</b> have <b>seen</b> how she carries her sails in a sharp blow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stand by your muskets, lads; this {{is but a}} {{trick to}} prevent us from seeing what the troops are doing!" [...] some one shouted, and just then, as if God himself was aiding us of the colonies, the first breeze of wind I had felt that day came up from the west, {{sweeping}} away the smoke <b>until</b> <b>we</b> could <b>see</b> line after line of the Britishers marching steadily up the hill, but not coming in such close formation, being forced to turn aside here and there lest they trample upon the bodies {{of those who were}} left behind during the first retreat.|$|R
60|$|P.S.--I {{open this}} {{to tell you}} that such a {{gorgeous}} fish-knife, with our monograms upon it, has just arrived from Mrs. Preston, my father's old friend. I went to the Goldsmith's Company in Regent Street yesterday afternoon, and I bought--what do you think? It looks so beautiful upon its snow-white cotton wadding. I like them very broad and rather flat. I do hope you will think it all right. It fills me with the strangest feelings when I look at it. Come what may, foul weather or fair, sorrow or joy, that little strip of gold will still be with us--we shall <b>see</b> it <b>until</b> <b>we</b> can <b>see</b> no more.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've got {{my pocket}} compass with me," [...] {{answered}} Sam. [...] "That may help some. We know those towns are west of us. We can sail along <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> {{the lights and}} then go down and ask about the touring car." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{want to go}} to one {{of those}} high-toned places where they charge big prices," [...] {{observed}} Andy, as he began to fall to. [...] "We can't afford to cut a spread <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> how our venture is going to pan out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We never {{realize what}} the pioneers {{had to contend}} with when they first settled this country <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> things as they are here. To cut down forests, level the land, build houses and barns, and fix roads--it's an immense amount of labor, truly." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{had a long}} passage. Every inch {{of the way to}} the Downs was tide-work. Here we lay several days, waiting far a wind. It blew {{fresh from}} the southwest-half of that summer, and the captain was not willing to go out with a foul wind. We were {{surrounded}} with vessels of war, most of the Channel Fleet being at anchor around us. This made a gay scene, and we had plenty of music, and plenty of saluting. One day all hands turned-to together, and fired starboard and larboard, <b>until</b> <b>we</b> could <b>see</b> nothing but a few mast-heads. What it all meant I never heard, but it made a famous smoke, and a tremendous noise.|$|R
60|$|When {{the youth}} had been {{dispatched}} with the note, Sherlock Holmes gave his {{instructions to the}} servants. If any visitor were to call asking for Mrs. Hilton Cubitt, no information should be given as to her condition, but {{he was to be}} shown at once into the drawing-room. He impressed these points upon them with the utmost earnestness. Finally he led the way into the drawing-room, with the remark that the business was now out of our hands, and that we must while away the time as best <b>we</b> might <b>until</b> <b>we</b> could <b>see</b> what was in store for us. The doctor had departed to his patients, and only the inspector and myself remained.|$|R
50|$|Almighty God, {{through your}} grace, Blessed Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster, by his {{exemplary}} virtue, built up the flock entrusted to him. Grant that we, {{under the guidance}} of the Gospel, may follow his teaching and walk in sureness of life, <b>until</b> <b>we</b> come to <b>see</b> you face to face in your eternal kingdom. We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your son, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. Amen.|$|R
