5|$|Stela T was {{dedicated}} in 692 {{by an unknown}} ruler. It is a badly eroded schist sculpture bearing mostly <b>unreadable</b> glyphs accompanying a poorly preserved figure. The stela is conservative in style, being similar to the much older StelaU.|$|E
5|$|The captain {{asked for}} the descent {{checklist}} at 20:24:24. The fasten seat belt sign was switched on and the flight attendant started the process of preparing the cabin for landing. At 20:24:46 the captain, {{as part of the}} checklist, informed the first officer that they would go down to 1,500 ft at Torghatten and then down to 550ft. This was followed first by a partially <b>unreadable</b> conversation between the captain and the first officers, which included if they were to fill fuel, and then an <b>unreadable</b> conversation between the captain and the jump seat passenger. The direction of the VHF omnidirectional radio range (VOR) and distance measuring equipment (DME) at Brønnøysund was checked at 20:26:37.|$|E
5|$|Controversy {{had arisen}} before the Giro {{when it was}} {{revealed}} that many of 's sponsors in Kazakhstan had not paid their full obligations to the team, and that the riders had therefore not been paid their full salaries to that point in the season. In protest, the team wore new jerseys beginning with this stage, that had the names of those underpaying sponsors faded out {{to the point of being}} <b>unreadable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pirates of the Caribbean was {{the first}} film {{released}} under the Walt Disney Pictures banner to be rated PG-13 by the MPAA; one executive noted that she found the film too intense for her five-year-old child. Nonetheless, the studio was confident enough to add The Curse of the Black Pearl subtitle to the film in case sequels were made, and to attract older children. Verbinski disliked the new title {{because it is the}} Aztec gold rather than the ship that is cursed, so he requested the title to be <b>unreadable</b> on the poster.|$|E
5|$|This type of sundial {{is known}} as an {{equatorial}} sundial because {{the plane of the}} dial face is parallel to the Earth's equatorial plane. Two primary examples of modified equatorial sundials are bowstring equatorial and armillary dials. Both of these modified equatorial sundials can be read year-round on the same surface, regardless of whether the Sun is above or below the equatorial plane whereas a standard equatorial sundial changes sides with each equinox and is virtually <b>unreadable</b> near the equinoxes when the Sun is located on the equatorial plane.|$|E
5|$|First {{discovered}} in March 1973, the tablets were initially {{thought to be}} wood shavings until one of the excavators found two stuck together and peeled them apart to discover writing on the inside. They {{were taken to the}} epigraphist Richard Wright, but rapid oxygenation of the wood meant that they were black and <b>unreadable</b> {{by the time he was}} able to view them. They were sent to Alison Rutherford at Newcastle University Medical School for multi-spectrum photography, which led to infra-red photographs showing the scripts for researchers for the first time. The results were initially disappointing as the scripts were undecipherable. However, Alan Bowman at Manchester University and David Thomas at Durham University analysed the previously unknown form of cursive script and were able to produce transcriptions.|$|E
5|$|Assisted by {{the school}} janitor Mister One, and pursued by a {{grotesque}} scarecrow-like being named Labor 9 who suddenly appears on the school grounds, Ryouta and Sakuya begin investigating the dome and the murder. They visit the lab and compare alibis; Shuu, who Ryouta distrusts, asks if Ryouta has forgotten anything important, to which he replies that he hasn't. Upon investigating the headmaster's office, they discover the headmaster had likewise been poisoned to death, what they saw earlier being merely pre-recorded footage; they also find a computer {{and a pair of}} documents, one titled The Human Representative and a torn, <b>unreadable</b> one titled Operation Hatoful. The Human Representative reveals that if the protagonist, a symbol of humanity, were to die, the campus would be sealed off and the birds inside handed over to humans as sacrifices—something confirmed when the computer is used to open a small hatch in the dome and students are shot dead as they attempt to flee—when the dome is lifted twelve hours after her death is reported.|$|E
5|$|At the Middle Preclassic city of Nakbe in {{the central}} lowlands, Maya sculptors were {{producing}} {{some of the earliest}} lowland Maya stelae, depicting richly dressed individuals. Nakbe Stela1 has been dated to around 400BC. It was broken into pieces, but originally represented two elaborately dressed figures facing each other, and perhaps represents the transference of power from one ruler to his successor, however it also has features that recall the myth of the Maya Hero Twins, and would be the earliest known presentation of them. Around 200BC the enormous nearby city of ElMirador had started to erect stela-like monuments, bearing inscriptions that appear to be glyphs but that are so far <b>unreadable.</b> Stela dating to the Late Preclassic period are also known from the sites of El Tintal, Cival, and San Bartolo in Guatemala, and Actuncan and Cahal Pech in Belize.|$|E

25|$|With {{increasing}} {{technology in}} computer filtering and {{manipulation of the}} results, samples in solution can now be measured accurately (water produces a broad absorbance across the range of interest, and thus renders the spectra <b>unreadable</b> without this computer treatment).|$|E

Informal votes include voting papers in which the voter had not clearly indicated their first preference. Invalid votes include voting papers that were <b>unreadable</b> or cancelled.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} his {{emphatic}} declaration that science is not technology, Dewdney seems here to pillory neural nets as bad science when most of those devising them {{are just trying to}} be good engineers. An <b>unreadable</b> table that a useful machine could read would still be well worth having.|$|E
25|$|Burned CD-Rs {{suffer from}} {{material}} degradation, just like most writable media. CD-R media have an internal layer of dye used to store data. In a CD-RW disc, the recording layer {{is made of}} an alloy of silver and other metals—indium, antimony, and tellurium. In CD-R media, the dye itself can degrade, causing data to become <b>unreadable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Adherents of Dongba had no {{places of}} worship, {{and so they}} were not officially {{recognized}} as a religion by the Communists following their arrival to the region. A Dongba shaman is merely a part-time practitioner priest, who is literate in Dongba religious texts that were <b>unreadable</b> by most Nashi, who are not usually taught to read their own language.|$|E
25|$|Australian {{vehicle number}} plates are {{issued by the}} states and territories, the Commonwealth government, and {{the armed forces of}} Australia. The plates are {{associated}} with a vehicle and generally last for the time the vehicle remains registered in the state, though as they become <b>unreadable</b> (or for other reasons) they may be recalled or replaced with newer ones.|$|E
25|$|Major recent {{historical}} {{research has been}} based on a set of documents that have survived from that period, untranslated. They are the administrative records of the colony, <b>unreadable</b> by most scholars. Since the 1970s, a professor named Charles Gehring has made it his life's work to translate this first-hand history of the Colony of New Netherland.|$|E
25|$|The Tale of Genji {{was written}} in an archaic court {{language}} that was already <b>unreadable</b> a century after it was written. Thus, the Japanese have been reading annotated and illustrated versions of the work since {{as early as the}} 12th century. It was not until the early 20th century that Genji was translated into modern Japanese, by the poet Akiko Yosano.|$|E
25|$|A blank 40‑track disk {{formatted}} {{and written}} on an 80‑track drive {{can be taken}} to its native drive without problems, and a disk formatted on a 40‑track drive can be used on an 80‑track drive. Disks written on a 40‑track drive and then updated on an 80 track drive become <b>unreadable</b> on any 40‑track drives due to track width incompatibility.|$|E
25|$|Out of some {{hundreds}} of thousands of intercepted encrypted texts, it is claimed under 3,000 have been partially or wholly decrypted. All the duplicate one-time pad pages were produced in 1942, and almost all of them had been used by the end of 1945, with a few being used as late as 1948. After this, Soviet message traffic reverted to being completely <b>unreadable.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Civil War Memorial in Washington Park is {{a marble}} {{memorial}} column erected in 1873. The monument {{was designed and}} built by Edward McInnhill. The monument and statue atop it, known as the Goddess of Liberty, pays tribute to LaSalle County American Civil War veterans. The marble faces contain the name of over 800 Civil War dead {{but most of the}} names are <b>unreadable</b> due to deterioration.|$|E
25|$|After Cassini launch, it was {{discovered}} that data sent back from the probe to European Space Agency's mission control center was largely <b>unreadable.</b> It was determined that Cassini receiver was unable to accurately process the changes in frequency and wavelength of the signal it would be receiving from Huygens during its descent to Titan. The problem was rectified by changing the distance and angle of Cassini trajectory to Huygens during the landing.|$|E
25|$|Though it is {{difficult}} to define what can properly be called a 'Cubist sculpture', Picasso's 1909-10 Head bares the hallmarks of early Cubism in that the various surfaces constituting the face and hair are broken down into irregular fragments that meet at sharp angles, rendering practically <b>unreadable</b> the basic volume of the head beneath. These facets are obviously a translation from two to three dimensions of the broken planes of Picasso's 1909-10 paintings.|$|E
25|$|All {{practitioners}} of Tresum {{are divided into}} two houses: Moon, related to water and female energy, and Sun related to fire and male energy, each having a book <b>unreadable</b> to non-initiates in which its knowledge is kept. A third house, Sky, is stated to combine both houses, with a book merging the knowledge of both. A fourth house, Shadows, is revealed as a major threat in season three, having previously been imprisoned by the other houses.|$|E
25|$|Detractors {{described}} Cozzens as a hardcore {{political and}} religious conservative, although in fact he was largely apolitical and not particularly religious. His attempts to counter this incorrect image met with little success, and he soon forfeited whatever fanbase he gained from By Love Possessed. His reputation was further lambasted during 1968 by critics (in particular John Updike) of his final book, Morning, Noon, and Night, which had a nearly <b>unreadable</b> style (even by the author's usual standards) and an uninteresting, uncompelling protagonist.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the modern}} era, {{cryptography}} focused on message confidentiality (i.e., encryption)—conversion of messages from a comprehensible form into an incomprehensible one {{and back again}} at the other end, rendering it <b>unreadable</b> by interceptors or eavesdroppers without secret knowledge (namely the key needed for decryption of that message). Encryption attempted to ensure secrecy in communications, {{such as those of}} spies, military leaders, and diplomats. In recent decades, the field has expanded beyond confidentiality concerns to include techniques for message integrity checking, sender/receiver identity authentication, digital signatures, interactive proofs and secure computation, among others.|$|E
25|$|An example: Suppose {{there is}} a library {{function}} whose purpose is to parse a single syslog file entry. What should this function do if the entry is malformed? There is no one right answer, because the same library could be deployed in programs for many different purposes. In an interactive log-file browser, {{the right thing to}} do might be to return the entry unparsed, so the user can see it—but in an automated log-summarizing program, {{the right thing to do}} might be to supply null values for the <b>unreadable</b> fields, but abort with an error, if too many entries have been malformed.|$|E
25|$|Another {{source of}} {{contention}} {{is that the}} Brown crime scene fingerprint has the appearance of having been rolled, which is the practice of taking a person's inked finger and rolling it on an index card, and not the smudged, bloody and <b>unreadable</b> print as originally reported. Traditionally, after the fingertip is covered in ink from either the suspect's hand being pressed {{on top of an}} ink pad or an ink roller being run across it, the finger is placed on the card on one edge. It is rolled once from one edge to the finger's other edge to produce a large, clear print.|$|E
25|$|Luftwaffe {{messages}} {{were the first}} to be read in quantity. The German navy had much tighter procedures, and the capture of code books was needed before they could be broken. When, in February 1942, the German navy introduced the four-rotor Enigma for communications with its Atlantic U-boats, this traffic became <b>unreadable</b> for a period of ten months. Britain produced modified bombes, but it was the success of the US Navy bombe that was the main source of reading messages from this version of Enigma {{for the rest of the}} war. Messages were sent to and fro across the Atlantic by enciphered teleprinter links.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} text is from Alexanders saga, an Alexander romance. The manuscript, AM 519 a 4to, is dated c. 1280. The facsimile {{demonstrates the}} sigla used by scribes to write Old Norse. Many {{of these were}} borrowed from Latin. Without familiarity with these abbreviations, the facsimile will be <b>unreadable</b> to many. In addition, reading the manuscript itself requires familiarity with the letterforms of the native script. The abbreviations are expanded in a version with normalized spelling like the standard normalization system's. Comparing this to the spelling of the same text in Modern Icelandic shows that, while pronunciation has changed greatly, spelling has changed little.|$|E
25|$|They were {{originally}} used, and still are, {{to increase the}} sensitivity range of photographic emulsions, i.e., to increase the range of wavelengths which will form an image on the film, making the film panchromatic. Cyanines are also used in CD-R and DVD-R media. The ones used are mostly green or light blue in color, and are chemically unstable. This makes unstabilized cyanine discs unsuitable for archival CD and DVD use, as they can fade and become <b>unreadable</b> in a few years, however, recent cyanine discs contain stabilizers that slow down the deterioration significantly. These discs are often rated with an archival life of 75 years or more. The other dyes used in CD-Rs are phthalocyanine and azo.|$|E
25|$|That is to say, the {{question}} {{can only be}} answered {{in terms of the}} broader goals of the program, which are not known to the general-purpose library function. Nonetheless, exiting with an error message is only rarely the right answer. So instead of simply exiting with an error, the function may establish restarts offering various ways to continue—for instance, to skip the log entry, to supply default or null values for the <b>unreadable</b> fields, to ask the user for the missing values, or to unwind the stack and abort processing with an error message. The restarts offered constitute the mechanisms available for recovering from error; the selection of restart by the condition handler supplies the policy.|$|E
25|$|For non-sighted users (for example blind users, {{or color}} blind {{people on a}} color-using test), visual CAPTCHAs present serious problems. Because CAPTCHAs are {{designed}} to be <b>unreadable</b> by machines, common assistive technology tools such as screen readers cannot interpret them. Since sites may use CAPTCHAs as part of the initial registration process, or even every login, this challenge can completely block access. In certain jurisdictions, site owners could become targets of litigation if they are using CAPTCHAs that discriminate against certain people with disabilities. For example, a CAPTCHA may make a site incompatible with Section 508 in the United States. In other cases, those with sight difficulties can choose to identify a word being read to them.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the four}} copies {{made by the}} Home Army, one, hidden in the {{basement}} of former Arka workers Hanna and Adam Mickiewicz, was accidentally destroyed by Soviet soldiers who were billeted at the Mickiewiczes' home and used the basement as a latrine and waste dump. Another copy was buried in the ground, but soon after the war a housing project was constructed on top of the site. A third copy was burned by its holder who was afraid of being imprisoned if it were found by the Polish Communist Secret Police or the NKVD; during the Stalinist era in Poland, former Home Army were persecuted by the authorities and the microfilm would have been proof that he {{had been a member of}} the organization. The fourth copy survived however, sewn into Hanna's corset and was not found despite several searches of the Mickiewiczes' home and the arrest of Adam (he was released after Stalin's death in 1953 during the resulting period of political liberalization). Based on these experiences Hanna kept the existence of the final microfilm secret for many years, to keep appearances wore the corset in everyday life, and did not come forward with the information until after the fall of communism, in 1991. When finally recovered many of the microfilms had sweat stain on them and some were <b>unreadable.</b> The recovery took several years; the first restored documents were not available until 1999.|$|E
25|$|Errors in the {{original}} body and coffins counts quickly became apparent. Father John P. Chidwick, the Roman Catholic chaplain aboard the Maine {{at the time of}} its destruction, had overseen {{the original}} interments in February and March 1898. He now also oversaw the disinterment. Chidwick's records showed that there should have been 154 coffins, but only 151 were recovered. Additionally, Chidwick's list of the dead showed two unidentified bodies were unaccounted for. Several reasons for the discrepancies were offered: Clerical errors, errors made by the overburdened Chidwick, and more than one body in the same casket. Chidwick, Colon Cemetery officials, and Cuban authorities were convinced, however, that no bodies had been lost. Disinterment also revealed a new problem: At the time of burial, identified remains had a number painted on the exterior of the coffin that corresponded with a name on Chidwick's list of dead. But by the time of disinterment, the numbers on many of these coffins were <b>unreadable.</b> Identified remains thus became unidentified. Another problem was the way the dead were buried. As bodies were buried at Colon Cemetery, the row and grave number was supposed to be noted for each casket. Unfortunately, the cemetery superintendent only noted which row each identified body was in—not the actual grave number. This, too, made it sometimes impossible to determine in which grave identified remains laid. Some casket numbers were readable, however. Those bodies which still could be identified had their names painted on the exterior of the new coffin. The old coffins were burned.|$|E
