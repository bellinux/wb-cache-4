5|$|A {{number of}} non-SI units {{that had never}} been {{formally}} sanctioned by the CGPM have continued to be used across the globe in many spheres including health care and navigation. As with the units of measure in Tables 6 and 7, these have been catalogued by the CIPM in the SI Brochure to ensure consistent usage, but with the recommendation that authors who <b>use</b> <b>them</b> should define them wherever they are used.|$|E
5|$|A {{well-known}} practical joke among chemists is {{to fashion}} gallium spoons and <b>use</b> <b>them</b> to serve tea to unsuspecting guests, since gallium {{has a similar}} appearance to its lighter homolog aluminium. The spoons then melt in the hot tea.|$|E
5000|$|A towel dryer or {{a heated}} towel rail is a feature {{designed}} to heat towels before <b>using</b> <b>them.</b> For many years European hotels have been <b>using</b> <b>them</b> as combined towel- dryers/racks.|$|R
40|$|More {{and more}} {{development}} workers tell stories of mobile surprises - not just who is <b>using</b> <b>them,</b> {{and where they}} are <b>using</b> <b>them,</b> but also how they are <b>using</b> <b>them.</b> Through mobiles, the first digital information and communication technologies (ICTs) have reached poor households and communities. In less than a generation, the majority of poor people will have access to mobile phones and services...|$|R
5000|$|UK railway {{companies}} did {{not agree}} {{on the merits of}} snifting valves. The London and North Eastern Railway <b>used</b> <b>them</b> very widely. The Southern Railway <b>used</b> <b>them</b> for a while but later removed them.|$|R
5|$|Archaeal lipid tails {{differ from}} those of other organisms in that they are based upon long isoprenoid chains with {{multiple}} side-branches, sometimes with cyclopropane or cyclohexane rings. By contrast, the fatty acids in the membranes of other organisms have straight chains without side branches or rings. Although isoprenoids {{play an important role in}} the biochemistry of many organisms, only the archaea <b>use</b> <b>them</b> to make phospholipids. These branched chains may help prevent archaeal membranes from leaking at high temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Ascending and {{descending}} chain {{conditions are}} general, {{meaning that they}} can be applied to many types of mathematical objects—and, on the surface, they might not seem very powerful. Noether showed how to exploit such conditions, however, to maximum advantage: for example, how to <b>use</b> <b>them</b> to show that every set of sub-objects has a maximal/minimal element or that a complex object can be generated by a smaller number of elements. These conclusions often are crucial steps in a proof.|$|E
5|$|At present, hang baits {{are illegal}} off Isla Guadalupe and reputable dive {{operators}} do not <b>use</b> <b>them.</b> Operators in South Africa and Australia {{continue to use}} hang baits and pinniped decoys. In South Australia, playing rock music recordings underwater, including the AC/DC album Back in Black has also been used experimentally to attract sharks.|$|E
5000|$|Dhwansak sarp : short-living magical snakes which explode at will causing major {{damage to}} their surroundings. Though Nagfani-sarp warned Nagraj about <b>using</b> <b>them</b> too frequently, Nagraj never {{ever had any}} {{problems}} with their numbers while <b>using</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
50|$|Scotticisms are {{generally}} {{divided into two}} types: covert Scotticisms, which generally go unnoticed as being particularly Scottish by those <b>using</b> <b>them,</b> and overt Scotticisms, usually used for stylistic effect, with those <b>using</b> <b>them</b> aware of their Scottish nature.|$|R
50|$|Today, 3D {{models are}} used {{in a wide variety}} of fields. The medical {{industry}} uses detailed models of organs; these may be created with multiple 2-D image slices from an MRI or CT scan. The movie industry <b>uses</b> <b>them</b> as characters and objects for animated and real-life motion pictures. The video game industry <b>uses</b> <b>them</b> as assets for computer and video games. The science sector <b>uses</b> <b>them</b> as highly detailed models of chemical compounds. The architecture industry <b>uses</b> <b>them</b> to demonstrate proposed buildings and landscapes in lieu of traditional, physical architectural models. The engineering community <b>uses</b> <b>them</b> as designs of new devices, vehicles and structures as well as a host of other uses. In recent decades the earth science community has started to construct 3D geological models as a standard practice. 3D models can also be the basis for physical devices that are built with 3D printers or CNC machines.|$|R
5|$|Coprinopsis variegata can attack soil bacteria, such as {{species of}} Pseudomonas and Agrobacterium, and <b>use</b> <b>them</b> as {{nutrient}} sources. The fungus achieves this by growing specialized hyphae {{in the direction}} of the bacteria, sensing them with some chemoattractive mechanism not yet fully understood. The fungus then secretes compounds to digest the bacteria while growing assimilative hyphae to absorb the nutrients. The process is relatively rapid, and bacterial colonies can be assimilated in less than 24 hours.|$|E
5|$|Following their defeat, straggling gendarmes retreated {{back into}} Angola. Tshombe began {{planning}} to <b>use</b> <b>them</b> to stage {{an invasion of}} the Congo, but this was cut short by his imprisonment in 1967. They reconstituted themselves as the Front de Libération Nationale Congolaise and made two attempts retake Katanga in the 1970s. Both failed, but secessionist insurgency activity continued. Hostilities resurfaced in 2006 after a new national constitution, which promulgated the division of Katanga into four new provinces, was adopted.|$|E
5|$|Foreseeing {{another war}} in Europe, Szilard {{moved to the}} United States in 1938, where he worked with Enrico Fermi and Walter Zinn on means of {{creating}} a nuclear chain reaction. He was present when this was achieved on December 2, 1942. He worked for the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory on aspects of nuclear reactor design. He drafted the Szilard petition advocating {{a demonstration of the}} atomic bomb, but the Interim Committee chose to <b>use</b> <b>them</b> against cities without warning.|$|E

50|$|The {{construction}} of improvised fighting vehicles may also reflect {{a lack of}} means for the force that <b>uses</b> <b>them.</b> This {{is especially true in}} developing countries, where various armies and guerrilla forces have <b>used</b> <b>them,</b> as they are more affordable than military-grade combat vehicles.|$|R
25|$|High school {{teachers}} and college professors have used Slinkys to simulate the properties of waves, United States troops in the Vietnam War <b>used</b> <b>them</b> as mobile radio antennas (as have amateur radio operators), and NASA has <b>used</b> <b>them</b> in zero-gravity physics experiments in the Space Shuttle.|$|R
5|$|In 1936, the {{previously}} dirt-covered yard was paved. The yard {{was part of}} the most violent escape attempt from Alcatraz in May 1946 when a group of inmates hatched a plot to obtain the key into the recreation yard, kill the tower guards, take hostages, and <b>use</b> <b>them</b> as shields to reach the dock.|$|E
5|$|In July 2017 the {{critical}} WiFi vulnerability BroadPwn affecting many iOS devices, including the iPad 2 was published. It allows an attacker to remotely {{take control of}} all affected devices within WiFi range without any user interaction. Since iOS 9 is in its end of life the iPad 2 won't receive a security patch for this vulnerability, making it dangerous to <b>use</b> <b>them</b> further.|$|E
5|$|In the 23 February 1859 {{edition of}} the Deseret News, the editors {{announced}} their approval of the two new letters and eventual intention to <b>use</b> <b>them</b> in the newsletter. However, due to the hot metal typesetting technology in use at the time, casting the new letters for use {{would have been a}} considerable expense, so it was never realized.|$|E

5|$|Morales had {{not taken}} {{a leading role in}} these protests, but did <b>use</b> <b>them</b> to get across his message that the MAS was not a single-issue party, and that rather than simply {{fighting}} for the rights of the cocalero it was arguing for structural change to the political system and a redefinition of citizenship in Bolivia.|$|E
5|$|Named {{after the}} nearby city of Winona, {{she was given}} her middle name, Laura, because of her parents' {{friendship}} with Laura Huxley, writer Aldous Huxley's wife. Her stage name derives from Mitch Ryder, a soul and rock singer of whom {{her father was a}} fan. Ryder's father is an atheist and her mother is a Buddhist; they encouraged their children to take the best part of other religions and <b>use</b> <b>them</b> to make their own belief systems.|$|E
5|$|On 17 December 1954, the North Atlantic Council {{approved}} MC 48, a key {{document in}} the evolution of NATO nuclear thought. MC 48 emphasized that NATO would have to use atomic weapons from the outset of a war with the Soviet Union whether or not the Soviets chose to <b>use</b> <b>them</b> first. This gave SACEUR the same prerogatives for automatic use of nuclear weapons as existed for the commander-in-chief of the US Strategic Air Command.|$|E

5|$|She grew {{close to}} Strasberg {{and his wife}} Paula, {{receiving}} private lessons at their home due to her shyness, and soon became like a family member. She dismissed her old drama coach, Natasha Lytess, and replaced her with Paula; the Strasbergs remained an important influence {{for the rest of}} her career. Monroe also started undergoing psychoanalysis at the recommendation of Strasberg, who believed that an actor must confront their emotional traumas and <b>use</b> <b>them</b> in their performances.|$|E
5|$|Surgical implants, {{either of}} {{flexible}} rods or inflatable tubes, {{are reserved for}} when other methods fail {{because of the potential}} for serious complications, which occur in as many as 10% of cases. They carry the risk of eroding penile tissue (breaking through the skin). Although satisfaction among men who <b>use</b> <b>them</b> is high, if they do need to be removed implants make other methods such as injections and vacuum devices unusable due to tissue damage.|$|E
5|$|The Catechism {{explains}} that this commandment regulates worldly goods, and forbids unjustly taking, using or damaging those {{that belong to}} someone else. It places requirements upon those who possess worldly goods to <b>use</b> <b>them</b> responsibly, taking into consideration the good of society. The Catechism addresses the concept of human stewardship of God's creation in its explanation of the seventh commandment and forbids abuse of animals and the environment.|$|E
