50|$|Kenny has {{described}} his style:"Do you want bland television where everything you hear reinforces your own view, {{or do you}} want to be challenged? I favour the latter. I like to challenge people. You might get angry and pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>to</b> Joe Duffy, or you might complain to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission; that's great.

5000|$|With Peter Webber selling HIWATTS {{as quickly}} as the Hylight Electronics garage {{workshop}} could turn them out, Dave Reeves knew he needed help. The most critical and time-consuming stage in building the amps was in the wiring of the chassis. (Note that the trademark [...] "right angles and neat bundles" [...] internal wiring was being used in Hiwatts as early as 1969, before anyone external was brought into the picture.) In 1971 Reeves picked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> book <b>to</b> find a wirer that would be able to re-create and fine tune his [...] "super neat" [...] approach to wiring amplifiers, and came across the name Harry Joyce.|$|R

Tyler and Marla embark on an uneasy affair that confounds the narrator and confuses Marla.

Because Tyler and Marla are never seen at the same time, the narrator wonders whether Tyler and Marla are the same person.|$|E

The gangsters and the rest of the ghosts fade away (even the bullet holes fade) and Manners is left alone with his memories, holding a gun, in the empty house, hand turning a doorknob but not fully, unable or unwilling to leave.|$|E
50|$|The {{main source}} of the {{controversy}} stems from portions of the film concerned with the Clinton administration in the 1990s. Critics say that certain dramatized scenes tend to suggest that blame for the events that took place on September 11, 2001 lies with Clinton and his cabinet. One example cited is {{a scene in which}} then National Security Advisor, Sandy Berger, does not approve of the order to take out a surrounded Osama bin Laden and tells the squad in Afghanistan that they will have to do the job without official authorization and then hangs <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> According <b>to</b> Sandy Berger and others - including conservative author and Clinton critic Richard Miniter - this never happened. Screenwriter Cyrus Nowrasteh has now admitted that the abrupt hang-up was not in the script and was improvised.|$|R
40|$|Although {{cell phones}} are {{extremely}} useful, {{they can be}} annoying and distracting to owners and others nearby. We describe sensing techniques intended to help make mobile phones more polite and less distracting. For example, our phone’s ringing quiets {{as soon as the}} user responds to an incoming call, and the ring mutes if the user glances at the caller ID and decides not to answer. We also eliminate the need to press a TALK buttontoansweranincomingcallby recognizing if <b>the</b> user picks <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and listens <b>to</b> it...|$|R

50|$|On August 24, 2007, George Hotz, a 17-year-old hacker from Glen Rock, New Jersey, {{broke the}} lock that ties Apple's iPhone to AT&T's {{wireless}} network. He confirmed that he unlocked {{the phone and}} was using it on T-Mobile's network. The hack opened up a realm of possibilities for overseas customers because iPhone was only sold in the US at the time. By unlocking it, Hotz opened <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>to</b> all kinds of phone networks across the world. Hotz posted the hack on his blog. The process is complicated and requires both disassembling iPhone and executing software commands on a personal computer. Hotz, along with four others across the world, reportedly spent about 500 hours unlocking the phone.|$|E
5000|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding Untermeyer led to him being blacklisted by the television industry. According to Untermeyer's friend Arthur Miller, Untermeyer became so depressed by his forced departure from What's My Line? that {{he refused to}} leave his home in Brooklyn {{for more than a}} year, and his wife Bryna answered all incoming phone calls. [...] It was she who eventually told Miller what had happened because Untermeyer would not pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>to</b> talk to him, even though Miller's support of blacklisted writers and radio and television personalities was well-known to Untermeyer and many others. But for more than a year, whenever Miller dialed the Untermeyers' phone number, Bryna [...] "talked obscurely about husband Louis not wanting phone conversations anymore, preferring to wait until we could all get together again," [...] wrote Miller.|$|E
50|$|Terry calls Gwen {{after hearing}} of the attack and tells her to leave Washington for Tennessee with Mako, but the FBI enter and force her <b>to</b> hang <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> She decides <b>to</b> {{accompany}} Terry back to Japan, as he is due to be deported in an Ambassador exchange, and there is nearly a riot as she leaves with the other Japanese families, because of anti-Japanese fervor sweeping {{the nation in the}} aftermath of the attack on Pearl Harbor, The Philippines, and other European and American held colonies and bases in the Pacific and Asia.|$|R

500|$|From 1930 to 1934, Beebe and Barton {{used the}} Bathysphere {{to conduct a}} series of dives of {{increasing}} depth {{off the coast of}} Nonsuch Island, becoming the first people to observe deep-sea animals in their native environment. The Bathysphere was lowered into the ocean using a steel cable, and a second cable carried a <b>phone</b> line which <b>the</b> Bathysphere's occupants used to communicate with the surface, as well as an electrical cable for a searchlight to illuminate animals outside the Bathysphere. Beebe's observations were relayed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> line <b>to</b> be recorded by Gloria Hollister, his chief technical associate who was also in charge of preparing specimens obtained from dredging. Beebe and Barton made a total of 35 dives in the Bathysphere, setting several consecutive world records for the deepest dive ever performed by a human. The record set by the deepest of these, to a depth of [...] on August 15, 1934, lasted until it was broken by Barton in 1949.|$|R
5000|$|Teams next {{made their}} way to Isaac Tamayo Street, where they were told to find [...] "Miguel". They had to figure out that the person with their next clue was man named Miguel who was playing a set of panpipes. Specifically, he would be playing [...] "Indian Love Song (Miguel)" [...] by Alma Zohar, a song about an woman calling Miguel from Israel to say that she loved him. The clue Miguel gave them told them to enter the {{confusing}} market nearby and find a marked stall on Garcilaso de la Vega Street. The woman at the stall did not have a clue, but when teams arrived the telephone would start ringing. Teams would pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>to</b> find that their loved ones were calling them from Israel, just like in the aforementioned song. After the call, the teams' family told them their next clue.|$|E
50|$|Another simple trick {{used by the}} {{fraudsters}} is to ask the called {{parties to}} hang up and dial their bank, but after the victim hangs up, the fraudster does not, keeping the line open and remaining connected when the victim picks <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>to</b> dial. When in doubt, calling a company's telephone number listed on billing statements or other official sources is recommended, as opposed to calling numbers received from messages or callers of dubious authenticity. However, sometimes hanging up and redialing is insufficient: if the caller has not hung up, the victim might still be connected, and the fraudster spoofs a dial tone down the phone line to entice the victim to dial. Then the fraudster's accomplice answers and impersonates whomever the victim is trying to call. This {{is known as a}} 'no hang-up' scam. Hence consumers are advised to use a different phone when dialing a company's number to confirm.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou" [...] Mona and the Liars go to Mona's bedroom {{expecting to}} meet Leslie. Leslie texts Mona {{to tell her}} that she won't be coming to meet them as {{confrontations}} like this could set her recovery back. Aria thinks that they should drive over to Leslie's house because she knows more about Charles than she is letting on. Mona says that if Leslie knew more about Charles then she would have told her. Later in the episode Mona and Mike reconcile with each other, but she thinks that he should stay away from her because she deserved to be in the dollhouse. Mike ends this by kissing Mona passionately. Alison gets a lift from Mona. Alison says that Mona {{was the only one that}} picked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>to</b> her. Alison calls the police and confesses that Charles Dilaurentis is A and her brother. Mona says she shouldn't have done that.|$|E

Four days later, Brendan Rodgers slammed Sterling's advisors (Aidy Ward) on the interview, saying, [...] "You are not a 20-year-old boy and you pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and ask <b>to</b> speak to the BBC.
