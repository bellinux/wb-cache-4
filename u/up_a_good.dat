5|$|Scotland {{hosted the}} Magical Magyars of Hungary in December 1954 {{in front of}} 113,506 fans. The Scots put <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> fight {{against one of the}} most {{outstanding}} teams in the world at the time, but eventually lost 4–2. Scotland qualified for the 1958 FIFA World Cup by defeating Spain, including Luis Suarez, Ladislao Kubala and Alfredo Di Stéfano, at Hampden.|$|E
5|$|In {{the trials}} {{match for the}} 1910 Five Nations Championship, Guillemin was {{selected}} {{to play for the}} Possibles against the Probables. The Probables won a close game 9–6, and Guillemin was selected again to play for France. The fourth match between England and France was held at Leicester on 30 January 1909. The English dominated from the start but the French put <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> fight, as both the English and French press reported. The French forwards were compared in their style of play with those of Ireland, with good footballing skills. Although the English won a fourth successive victory, 22–0, it seemed as though the French game was beginning to develop.|$|E
5|$|Nakajima {{once again}} {{participated in the}} Junior League in June 2007, {{finishing}} in third place for his block with four points, behind Hijikata and Kondo. The league was won by American wrestler Chris Sabin, setting up a title match between Sabin and Nakajima on August 26, 2007, in which Nakajima was victorious. On September 1, 2007, Nakajima challenged Pro Wrestling Noah's Takeshi Morishima for his ROH World Championship in the main event of a Kensuke Office show, putting <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> fight but losing in the end. On September 19, 2007, Nakajima was pinned in a tag team match by visiting luchador Silver King, who then challenged Nakajima to a future junior heavyweight title match. The match was made official for October 18, 2007 at All Japan's 35th anniversary show; on October 8, 2007, Nakajima suffered a fractured navicular bone in his right hand, forcing him off of several shows on the tour, though he defended the title as scheduled. When the match came, Nakajima and Silver King fought to a no contest, forcing PWF commissioner Hiroshi Hase {{to hold up the}} title belt, although Nakajima remained the official champion. Katsuhiko then took time off to nurse his injured hand.|$|E

25|$|Because of Muawiyah's {{families}} previous {{opposition to}} the Muslims, before they converted to Islam, there was still some level of resentment towards him. Some of his relatives {{had been killed in}} battles fighting against the Muslims. But Muawiyah felt that after his conversion to Islam, for over 20 years, he had been the governor of Syria and expanded the state, confronted the Romans, built <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> administration, a good economy and therefore felt that people should not resent his past.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} his late teens that {{it was pointed out}} that he would turn into an {{international}} wicket-keeper, as he was a budding fast bowler that was building <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> reputation at junior level. He was clocked at 75mph at the age of 14, although the only issue was that the majority of his bowling was waist-high. He then moved onto unorthodox off-breaks, which were deemed illegal right from the start, and so he started to keep wicket for his school.|$|E

25|$|The Marine Corps’ {{military}} operations in urban terrain doctrine recognizes that tactical success does not necessarily translate to strategic victory. It notes the Israeli’s tactical victory in Beirut was a strategic defeat—and observes the same about the Battle of Hue in the Vietnam War, when Marines defeated an enemy that sought to put <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> fight but never expected to win. Much {{the same can be}} said of Fallujah’s defenders. In spite of the beating they took in November, they will continue to assert they repelled the initial attack and fought well thereafter.|$|E
25|$|Botham {{took over}} the {{captaincy}} in 1980 and they put <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> fight against the West Indies, losing a five match Test series 1–0, although England were humbled in the return series. After scoring a pair in the first Test against Australia, Botham lost the captaincy due to his poor form, {{and was replaced by}} Mike Brearley. Botham returned to form and played exceptionally in the remainder of the series, being named man of the match in the third, fourth and fifth Tests. The series became known as Botham's Ashes as England recorded a 3–1 victory.|$|E
25|$|Dean Bailey was {{appointed}} as {{coach for the}} 2008 season, but success did not follow, as Melbourne lost their first six matches, before breaking through with a record comeback win in round seven against Fremantle. They showed signs of improvement, putting <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> fight in round nine against top-of-the-ladder team Hawthorn, who were undefeated at the time. Melbourne {{had to wait until}} Round 14 for the second win. After good performances against Collingwood, Richmond, and Sydney in the preceding weeks, the Demons defeated Brisbane by a solitary point in the two teams' first encounter at the MCG in nine years.|$|E

25|$|In 1945, {{with the}} defeat of the major fascist regimes in World War II, Salazar was forced to fake some {{democratic}} changes to keep <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> image {{in the eyes of the}} West, so in October of that year, the democratic resistance was authorized to form a platform, which was named Movement of Democratic Unity (Portuguese: Movimento de Unidade Democrática, or MUD). Initially, the MUD was controlled by the moderate opposition, but it soon became strongly influenced by the PCP, which controlled its youth wing. In the leadership of the youth wing were several communists, among them Octávio Pato, Salgado Zenha, Mário Soares, Júlio Pomar and Mário Sacramento. This influence led to the MUD being outlawed by the government in 1948, after several waves of suppression.|$|E
25|$|Heavy {{overnight}} rain {{made the}} pitch responsive to spin and Bradman seizing this opportunity, declared, setting the Indians {{a target of}} 337. The Indians fared poorly in the second innings, with only Gul Mohammad and Kanwar Rai Singh making any noteworthy contributions, scoring 28 and 24. Singh stuck around giving a few lust hits here and there, but unfortunately for India, they folded up at 125, a score which seemed probable when they lost half of their side with just 60 runs on the board. Noteworthy performers for Australia were Bradman, Morris, Johnston, Johnson and Hassett. The Indians had some good individual performances {{in the form of}} Mankad and Amarnath, the former putting <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> all-round show, while the latter, picking up a match haul of 7 for 130.|$|E
25|$|In 1024, Pope John XIX {{confirmed}} Orso's {{right to}} hold Grado and confirmed the patriarchal rights of his see vis-à-vis Aquileia. However, Otto {{continued to use}} church appointments to his own personal and familial advantage and the enemies of the Orseoli in Venice, with popular support, moved to depose him in 1026. They arrested him, shaved his beard, and banished him to Constantinople. There he was well received by Constantine VIII, the uncle of his sister-in-law, who repealed trade privileges previously granted to the Republic under Pietro II. Not for nothing had Otto built <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> rapport with the emperors of Europe: the Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II likewise revoked Venetian trade privileges {{in response to his}} deposition. His father-in-law Stephen I of Croatia, at the instigation of Otto's son Pietro, attacked the coastal cities of Dalmatia, capturing several from Venice.|$|E
