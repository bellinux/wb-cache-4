The result was a deliberate state-led industrialisation policy to enable Japan to quickly catch <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Bank</b> of Japan, founded in 1882, used taxes to fund model steel and textile factories. Education was expanded and Japanese students were sent to study in the west.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, the British economy {{suffered}} from several difficulties. Despite tax increases announced in July 1966, the 1967 budget {{had set the}} greatest deficit in post-war history of £1,000,000,000. Each month, the Board of Trade published figures of the 'balance of trade' between exports and imports which seemed to show an ever-increasing deficit. The closure of the Suez Canal after the Six-Day War hit exporters, as did an unofficial dock strike, which broke {{out at the end}} of September. Having put <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> rate to 6 percent on 19 October, on 18 November, the government abandoned three years of attempting to maintain the exchange rate and devalued the pound sterling from $2.80 to $2.40. Although it was an economic defeat, devaluation was perceived as an export opportunity that British industry needed to seize.|$|E

500|$|The closing {{decade of}} the seventeenth century saw the {{generally}} favourable economic conditions that had dominated since the Restoration come to an end.

The famines of the 1690s were seen as particularly severe, partly because famine had become relatively rare in the second half {{of the seventeenth century}}, with only one year of dearth (in 1674) and the shortages of the 1690s would be the last of their kind.

500|$|On {{the same}} day Lieutenant Chris Pearce's 13 Troop, 3 Commando, on patrol with a platoon of Rhodesian African Rifles under Lieutenant Ron Marillier, was fired upon {{on the bank of}} the Maura River in {{northern}} Mashonaland by about 70 ZIPRA, encamped in a strong defensive position on the side of a hill feature. [...] "We were going on <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> and all hell broke loose," [...] recalled Pearce. [...] "How we didn't take casualties I didn't quite know." [...] Pearce's 12 men were pinned down by heavy machine-gun fire and outnumbered by around six to one. Lance-Corporal Dennis Croukamp [...] "on his own initiative and with complete disregard for his own safety" [...] in the words of the official report, twice crawled forward to throw grenades at the enemy position to allow the troop to redeploy into better cover. Pearce unsuccessfully attempted to assault the enemy position, then gave covering fire to an abortive flank attack by Marillier's RAR men. The security forces then attempted one final assault just before nightfall, but this also failed due to the superior numbers of ZIPRA fighters. The cadres dispersed and evacuated the area during the night and were gone when a Rhodesian sweep took place the next morning.|$|E

2500|$|Paris {{emerged as}} an {{international}} center of finance in the mid-19th century second only to London. It had a strong national bank and numerous aggressive private banks that financed projects all across Europe and the expanding Second French Empire. Napoleon III had the goal of overtaking London to make Paris the premier financial center of the world, but the war in 1870-71 hit finance hard and sharply reduced {{the range of the}} financial influence of Paris. One major development was the establishment of one of the main branches of the Rothschild family. In 1812, James Mayer Rothschild arrived in Paris from Frankfurt and set <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> Rothschild Frères. This bank helped fund Napoleon I's brief return from Elba and became one of the leading banks in European finance. The Rothschild banking family of France, along with other new investment banks, funded some of France's industrial and colonial expansion. [...] The Banque de France, founded in 1796, helped resolve the financial crisis of 1848 and emerged as a powerful central bank. The Comptoir National d'Escompte de Paris (CNEP) was established during the financial crisis and republican revolution of 1848. Its innovations included both private and public sources in funding large projects {{and the creation of a}} network of local offices to reach a much larger pool of depositors. Other major banks included the Société Générale and the Crédit Mobilier. The Crédit Lyonnais began in Lyon and moved to Paris.|$|E
