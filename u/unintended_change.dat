The results suggest that the inferior parietal region, in and around SMG, plays a role in sensorimotor adaptation for speech.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a parametric synthesis algorithm for planar mechanical systems comprised of higher kinematic pairs {{in which each}} part translates along a fixed axis or rotates around a fixed point. Kinematic functions are computed from the CAD models of the parts and are represented graphically as configuration spaces. The designer can request kinematic changes in the configuration spaces. The program constructs an objective function from the change requests. The objective function is minimized by line search. The line search repeats selection of a search direction and minimization of the objective function along a line with the selected search direction. To select a search direction, we use linear approximation or the conjugate gradient method. In the linear approximation method, the program linearizes contact equations and solves a linear system for a search direction. In the conjugate gradient method (a standard method to solve a quadratic problem), the program uses conjugate vectors as search directions. We use an approximate version of the original conjugate gradient method to minimize the objective function. After the line search has found a new design, the program compares the new kinematics with the initial kinematics by configuration space matching. If it detects an <b>unintended</b> <b>change,</b> it backs up, adds kinematic constraints that prevent the change, and resumes the computation. ...|$|E

40|$|Genetic {{modifications}} of trees may provide many benefits, e. g. increase production, and mitigate {{climate change and}} herbivore impacts on forests. However, genetic modifications sometimes result in unintended effects on innate traits involved in plant-herbivore interactions. The importance of intentional changes in plant defence relative to unintentional changes and the natural variation among clones used in forestry has not been evaluated. By a combination of biochemical measurements and bioassays we investigated if insect feeding on GM aspens is more affected by intentional (induction Bt toxins) than of unintentional, non-target changes or clonal differences in innate plant defence. We used two hybrid wildtype clones (Populus tremula x P. tremuloides and Populus tremula x P. alba) of aspen that have been genetically modified for 1) insect resistance (two Bt lines) or 2) reduced lignin properties (two lines COMT and CAD), respectively. Our measurements of biochemical properties suggest that <b>unintended</b> <b>changes</b> by GM modifications (occurring due to events in the transformation process) in innate plant defence (phenolic compounds) were generally smaller but fundamentally different than differences seen among different wildtype clones (e. g. quantitative and qualitative, respectively). However, neither clonal {{differences between the two}} wildtype clones nor <b>unintended</b> <b>changes</b> in phytochemistry influenced consumption by the leaf beetle (Phratora vitellinae). By contrast, Bt induction had a strong direct intended effect as well as a post experiment effect on leaf beetle consumption. The latter suggested lasting reduction of beetle fitness following Bt exposure that is likely due to intestinal damage suffered by the initial Bt exposure. We conclude that Bt induction clearly have intended effects on a target species. Furthermore, the effect of <b>unintended</b> <b>changes</b> in innate plant defence traits, when they occur, are context dependent and have in comparison to Bt induction probably less pronounced effect on targeted herbivores...|$|R

To be effective and efficient in managing this change, organizations and their managers need to develop effective and efficient change management strategy for the extreme ends stages in the innovation process – idea generation and implementation. Thus, the study was designed to explore the relationship among the various images of managing, the innovation process and change outcomes. The study adopted a survey research method, while simple random sampling technique was employed to select the employees that completed the questionnaire. The generated data were analysed using linear regression. It was found that coaching, interpreting and nurturing images of managing are significantly related to idea generation, while directing, navigating and caretaking images are related to idea implementation. Also, the directing, navigating and caretaking images are significantly related to intended, partially intended and <b>unintended</b> <b>change</b> outcomes respectively. The study recommends the employment of coaching, interpreting and nurturing images in idea generation, while directing, navigating and caretaking images should be employed by change managers in the management of idea implementation. However, this must be done with recourse to the managerial capabilities of the change manager and the nature of the prevailing business environment.

30|$|Phytic acid {{constitutes}} 75 - 80 % of {{the total}} phosphorus in cereal seeds {{but most of it}} is not accessible because the monogastric animals lack phytase, which is important for degradation of phytate molecule. This eventually leads to accelerate eutrophication due to the influx of phosphorus from animal waste which is the major source of agricultural phosphorus runoff (Reynolds and Davies 2001). Moreover, phytic acid readily binds to mineral cations and renders them unavailable for absorption by animals. Therefore, generation of low phytate rice is desirable for improving human nutrition and to reduce the load of phosphorus on environmental pollution. From the present investigation, it is evident that silencing of MIPS can yield major perturbation in the phytic acid biosynthetic pathway leading to substantial decrease in levels of phytate along with an increase in the amount of Pi content. However, the study also revealed that low phytate seeds had an <b>unintended</b> <b>change</b> in the levels of myo-inositol and ascorbate synthesis which is not desirable in view of its role in plants growth and development. Hence, it is clear that though MIPS presents itself as a candidate gene for manipulating phytate biosynthesis efficiently, silencing myo-inositol- 3 -phosphate synthase can yield major alterations in important metabolic pathways utilizing myo-inositol, which play key roles in different plant metabolisms. Therefore, a much detailed study of alterations caused in myo-inositol metabolism in view of disrupting MIPS expression, is required.|$|E
40|$|There are {{a growing}} number of rich, {{qualitative}} studies investigating patterns in the development of strategic change. These reveal that {{it is not possible to}} understand the incremental and emergent nature of strategic change in organisations without recognising the impact of micro organisational political and social processes. However, few studies set out to explore in depth the implementation of a particular strategic change initiative to examine how these micro processes affect the way the implementation develops through time. This thesis uses a longitudinal real-time case study of a planned strategic change implementation to do this. It examines how facilitating and obstructing processes developed during the implementation, and how these interacting processes affected the way the implementation progressed, from the perspective of middle managers as change recipients. r The findings show that during intended change implementation, the planned interventions put in place by senior managers as they intentionally try to carry out change also lead to the development of emergent facilitating and obstructing processes. A sensemaking perspective is adopted to show how these emergent change elements arise from recipient interpretations of the planned change interventions. A theory of mediation is proposed to account for the findings. However, the contribution of the research is not to do with the identification of the centrality of sensemaking processes during change. It is an empirical study which draws on existing theories on sensemaking to show how recipient sensemaking contributes to both intended and <b>unintended</b> <b>change</b> outcomes, thereby providing fresh insights into how and why change implementation becomes an emergent and incremental process.

The first part deals with the research background and methodology; the second part the research site context and, the ethnographic stories of change; the third part the findings and theory development; and the last chapter the theoretical and practical implications of the research findings...|$|E

40|$|It takes {{long time}} and huge {{amount of money to}} {{construct}} inter-city railway network. Careful demand forecasting and rational service planning are therefore required. However, long ranged demand forecasting is always facing to <b>unintended</b> <b>change</b> of regional population or change of the service level of competing transportation modes such as airline and inter-city express bus. Those changes sometimes resulted in severe decrease of demand for the constructed railway lines and discussion of abolishment of train service occurs. In order to avoid such tragedy, we want to build a robust network plan not vulnerable for the changes in forecasting conditions. This paper discusses the robustness of optimal inter-city railway network structure in Japan against alternative population distributions. Genetic Algorithm is applied to find best mixture of maximum operation speed category and number of daily train service for each link, which maximize the total consumer surplus of inter-city railway passengers. Consumer surplus is assessed by a gravity demand model considering service level along several routes for each OD pair. Travel time calculated by allocated link speed category, allocated train frequency, and estimated fare regressed by travel speed, will be summarized as route service level via ML route choice model parameters. In the GA, we consider a chromosome consists of two parts; speed category of 275 links and relative operation distance of trains in those links. Besides the real distribution of population in 197 Japanese local areas in the year of 1995, we set four other hypothetic population distributions; two of them concentrate in megalopolises like Tokyo, others disperse along geographically remote areas. We first obtain network structures optimized by the GA for each population setting. Speed category allocation will be compared for the five network plans. Secondly, we calculate total consumer surplus of each network plan under the different population settings and discuss the vulnerability of those plans. Thirdly, we optimize train operation plans for different population settings under the given speed category arrangements. The results shows that spatial arrangement of high speed railway service in 1995 keeps optimality for wide range of population settings, if we adjust number of trains according to alternative population distribution. ...|$|E

To do so, it injects semantics markers to the binary code before and after control transfer statements. The semantics markers also bear the conditions of branches. Thus, <b>unintended</b> <b>changes</b> in control flows can be revealed with only semantics markers in the program code.|$|R
