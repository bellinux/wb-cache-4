500|$|Until the 1970s, {{the chief}} {{academic}} publications on Cantor were two short monographs by Schönflies (1927) – largely the correspondence with Mittag-Leffler – and Fraenkel (1930). Both were at {{second and third}} hand; neither had much on his personal life. The gap was largely filled by Eric Temple Bell's Men of Mathematics (1937), which one of Cantor's modern biographers describes as [...] "perhaps the most widely read modern book {{on the history of}} mathematics"; and as [...] "one of the worst". Bell presents Cantor's relationship with his father as Oedipal, Cantor's differences with Kronecker as a quarrel between two Jews, and Cantor's madness as Romantic despair over his failure to win acceptance for his mathematics, and fills the picture with stereotypes. Grattan-Guinness (1971) found that none of these claims were true, but they may be found in many books of the intervening period, owing to the absence of any other narrative. There are other legends, independent of Bell – including one that labels Cantor's father a foundling, shipped to Saint Petersburg by <b>unknown</b> <b>parents.</b> A critique of Bell's book is contained in Joseph Dauben's biography.

He addressed this letter to his cousin Maria, partly in consideration of the dramatic farewell of that young lady, and its possible influence in turning her susceptible heart towards his protege.

6000|$|He {{had always}} called Sir Hugo Mallinger his uncle, {{and when it}} once {{occurred}} to him to ask about his father and mother, the baronet had answered, [...] "You lost your father and mother when you were quite a little one; that is why I take care of you." [...] Daniel then straining to discern something in that early twilight, had a dim sense of having been kissed very much, and surrounded by thin, cloudy, scented drapery, till his fingers caught in something hard, which hurt him, {{and he began to}} cry. Every other memory he had was of the little world in which he still lived. And at that time he did not mind about learning more, for he was too fond of Sir Hugo to be sorry for the loss of <b>unknown</b> <b>parents.</b> Life was very delightful to the lad, with an uncle who was always indulgent and cheerful--a fine man in the bright noon of life, whom Daniel thought absolutely perfect, and whose place was one of the finest in England, at once historical; romantic, and home-like: a picturesque architectural outgrowth from an abbey, which had still remnants of the old monastic trunk. Diplow lay in another county, and was a comparatively landless place which had come into the family from a rich lawyer on the female side who wore the perruque of the restoration; whereas the Mallingers had the grant of Monk's Topping under Henry the Eighth, and ages before had held the neighboring lands of King's Topping, tracing indeed their origin to a certain Hugues le Malingre, who came in with the Conqueror--and also apparently with a sickly complexion which had been happily corrected in his descendants. Two rows of these descendants, direct and collateral, females of the male line, and males of the female, looked down in the gallery over the cloisters on the nephew Daniel as he walked there: men in armor with pointed beards and arched eyebrows, pinched ladies in hoops and ruffs with no face to speak of; grave-looking men in black velvet and stuffed hips, and fair, frightened women holding little boys by the hand; smiling politicians in magnificent perruques, and ladies of the prize-animal kind, with rosebud mouths and full eyelids, according to Lely; then a generation whose faces were revised and embellished in the taste of Kneller; and so on through refined editions of the family types in the time of Reynolds and Romney, till the line ended with Sir Hugo and his younger brother Henleigh. This last had married Miss Grandcourt, and taken her name along with her estates, thus making a junction between two equally old families, impaling the three Saracens' heads proper and three bezants of the one with the tower and falcons argent of the other, and, as it happened, uniting their highest advantages in the prospects of that Henleigh Mallinger Grandcourt who is at present more of an acquaintance to us than either Sir Hugo or his nephew Daniel Deronda.|$|E

An earlier study with SSR markers indicated the original recorded pedigree of Honeycrisp' was incorrect and Keepsake' was identified as one putative parent, the other being unknown. The objective {{of this study was}} to verify Keepsake' as a parent and identify and genetically describe the <b>unknown</b> <b>parent</b> and its grandparents. A multi-family based dense and high-quality integrated SNP map was created using the apple 8 K Illumina Infinium SNP array. This map was used alongside a large pedigree-connected data set from the RosBREED project to build extended SNP haplotypes and to identify pedigree relationships. Keepsake' was verified as one parent of Honeycrisp' and Duchess of Oldenburg' and Golden Delicious' were identified as grandparents through the <b>unknown</b> <b>parent.</b> Following this finding, siblings of Honeycrisp' were identified using the SNP data. Breeding records from several of these siblings suggested that the previously unreported parent is a University of Minnesota selection, MN 1627. This selection is no longer available, but now is genetically described through imputed SNP haplotypes. We also present the mosaic grandparental composition of Honeycrisp' for each of its 17 chromosome pairs. This new pedigree and genetic information will be useful in future pedigree-based genetic studies to connect Honeycrisp' with other cultivars used widely in apple breeding programs. The created SNP linkage map will benefit future research using the data from the Illumina apple 8 and 20 K and Affymetrix 480 K SNP arrays. </p...|$|R

40|$|Address City, State/Province, Postal Code, Country email We view a dataset {{as having}} an {{underlying}} unknown tree structure and exploit this assumption in learning. This tree dependent identically distributed or tdid assumption preserves exchangeability and naturally generalizes iid assumptions. Each datum is sampled sequentially after being conditioned on an <b>unknown</b> <b>parent.</b> The resulting tdid likelihood of data is the determinant of a Laplacian of pairwise conditional distributions evaluations. Variants of tdid likelihood cover undirected and directed trees and can also reduce to iid likelihood (a simple product) when conditionals become independent. These build upon the graph Laplacian, a sufficient statistic that captures a distribution over tree structures for improved inference over standard point-estimates of structure. The tdid assumption leads to novel maximum likelihood estimators and inference methods. ...|$|R

40|$|Average {{relationship}} coefficients {{between groups}} of animals were calculated by repeating three calculation steps until convergence was reached. The {{first step was}} a stratified sampling of pedigrees. Second, relationships between animals in the sample were calculated, using the group relationships computed in a previous round for <b>unknown</b> <b>parent</b> relationships. Third, results were accumulated by group. Average relationship coefficients calculated in this way {{can be used for}} such purposes as to better understand the structure of a population, to more accurately calculate inbreeding coefficients, and to assign <b>unknown</b> <b>parent</b> groups using clustering methods. This method was applied to the pedigree data for the worldwide Holstein sire population. The data was derived from Interbull and North American pedigree databases. Groups were defined by year of birth, sex, and country. Average relationships between US and Canadian bulls increased across time from 0. 02 in 1960 to 0. 12 in 1999. The increase was continuous except for a plateau in 1992, followed by a slight decrease until 1995 when the trend to increase resumed. Average relationships across time comparing Canadian with European bulls and US with European bulls are quite similar. They increased from about 0 in 1963 to 0. 10 in 1999. After a peak of 0. 05 in 1966, the relationships dropped to 0. 03 in 1976 before starting to increase again. For bulls born in 1996 in the US, Canada, and Germany (representing a typical European country), the average relationships were: 0. 116 (CanadaCanada), 0. 112 (Canada-USA), 0. 1 (Canada-Germany), 0. 101 (USA-USA), 0. 101 (USAGermany) and 0. 084 (Germany-Germany).

40|$|A Bayesian {{treatment}} of latent directed graph structure for non-iid data is provided where each child datum is sampled with a directed conditional dependence {{on a single}} <b>unknown</b> <b>parent</b> datum. The latent graph structure is assumed to lie in the family of directed out-tree graphs which leads to efficient Bayesian inference. The latent likelihood of the data and its gradients are computable in closed form via Tutte’s directed matrix tree theorem using determinants and inverses of the out-Laplacian. This novel likelihood subsumes iid likelihood, is exchangeable and yields efficient unsupervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms. In addition to handling taxonomy and phylogenetic datasets the out-tree assumption performs surprisingly well as a semi-parametric density estimator on standard iid datasets. Experiments with unsupervised and semisupervised learning are shown on various UCI and taxonomy datasets. ...|$|R
