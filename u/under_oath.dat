5|$|The {{situation}} was so serious that Augustus himself {{appeared at the}} trial, {{even though he had}} not been called as a witness. <b>Under</b> <b>oath,</b> Augustus declared that he gave no such order. Murena disbelieved Augustus's testimony and resented his attempt to subvert the trial by using his auctoritas. He rudely demanded to know why Augustus had turned up to a trial to which he had not been called; Augustus replied that he came in the public interest. Although Primus was found guilty, some jurors voted to acquit, meaning that not everybody believed Augustus's testimony, an insult to the 'August One'.|$|E

5|$|Revie's {{reputation}} {{suffered in}} the late 1970s after his highly controversial England resignation. Both the Daily Mirror and Sunday People claimed that Revie had attempted to bribe Wolverhampton Wanderers players to lose a crucial match in May 1972. The papers quoted Wolves midfielder Danny Hegan and former Leeds United goalkeeper Gary Sprake's claims that Revie's captain Billy Bremner had tried to arrange a bribe. Bremner sued for libel and won £100,000 libel damages, along with legal costs, after both Hegan and Sprake refused to repeat their allegations <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> in court. Wolves player Derek Dougan, who had scored against Leeds in the match in question, testified {{that he had heard}} no mention of the alleged bribes.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} former Drexel Burnham Lambert {{investment}} banker Ken Moelis marked a major coup for Costas.

In his six years at UBS, Moelis ultimately {{assumed the role of}} president of UBS Investment Bank and was credited, along with Costas, with the build-out of UBS's investment banking operation in the United States. Within weeks of joining, Moelis brought over a team of 70 bankers from Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. Costas and Moelis hired more than 30 senior U.S. bankers from 2001 through 2004.|$|E

5|$|The {{election}} was {{opposed by the}} Cistercian monasteries of Yorkshire, and by the archdeacons of York. The Cistercians opposed {{on the grounds that}} the Second Lateran Council in 1139 had given the religious houses of a diocese the right to participate in the election of the bishop. Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury, refused to recognise William's election due to allegations of simony, or the acquisition of church positions by bribery, and of interference by King Stephen. In 1143, Pope Innocent II ruled that William could be confirmed in office if he swore <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> that the allegations were false. After he swore the oath, Henry of Blois, who was also papal legate, found William innocent, and he was consecrated as archbishop on 26 September 1143.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the Federal Election Commission {{ruled that}} Jackson could hire {{his wife on}} his {{campaign}} payroll {{as long as she}} was paid no more than the fair market value for her services. In 2002, Jackson was challenged in the Democratic primary by three candidates. Jackson claimed that state Sen. William Shaw and his brother, Cook County Board of Review Commissioner Robert Shaw, had planted a bogus candidate in the primary race. The claim was that they selected 68-year-old retired Robbins truck driver, Jesse L. Jackson, as an opponent in order to confuse voters and derail the congressman's re-election campaign. Jackson asked a Cook County court to question the Shaws and others <b>under</b> <b>oath,</b> but his effort was rejected and no criminal wrongdoing was found. As Jackson prepared to take further legal action, Jesse L. Jackson withdrew his candidacy after the unexpected deaths of his wife and grandson.|$|E

Burke showed about ten minutes of clips from the show at the April 28, 1999 meeting of the City Council's Police and Fire Committee and convinced aldermen to invite, under threat of subpoena, show host Jerry Springer to testify <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> as to whether the violence on the show was genuine or scripted.

5|$|Pelat {{had been}} a friend of François Mitterrand, then President of France, and at the centre of a scandal {{involving}} French Prime Minister Pierre Bérégovoy. As an investigative judge, Jean-Pierre could not dismiss any information brought to his attention pertaining to the case, especially if it might {{have led to a}} scandal similar to the one implicating an illegal Masonic lodge named Propaganda Due in the 1982 Banco Ambrosiano bank failure in Italy, Jean-Pierre ordered a search of Plantard's home. The search turned up a hoard of false documents, including some proclaiming Plantard the true king of France. Plantard admitted <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> that he had fabricated everything, including Pelat's involvement with the Priory of Sion. Plantard was threatened with legal action by the Pelat family and therefore disappeared to his house in southern France. He was 74 years old at the time.

5|$|Spivey {{intended}} {{to return to}} the Wildcats once the situation was resolved, which Kentucky's athletic association expected before reinstatement. On February 16, 1952, he and the association's directors agreed to have him testify before a grand jury in New York. After Spivey's grand jury appearance later in February, however, the university banned him permanently on March 2. In its statement, Kentucky's athletic board said evidence pointed to him fixing games during the 1950 Sugar Bowl Tournament. Gambler Jack West was charged with bribing two Wildcats players, Spivey and Walter Hirsch, to engage in point shaving during one of the tournament's games, and eventually pleaded guilty. In his grand jury testimony, Spivey denied receiving $1,000 to shave points in games from December 1950 to January 1951, or talking about doing so with gamblers. In April, the grand jury indicted him on charges of perjury for lying <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> during his testimony, claiming he had done so on seven occasions.|$|E
5|$|Inscriptions that specify land grants, {{rights and}} {{ownership}} were descriptive of {{the boundaries of}} demarcation using natural features such as rivers, streams, water channels, hillocks, large boulders, layout of the village, location of forts (kote) if any in the proximity, irrigation canals, temples, tanks and even shrubs and large trees. Also included {{was the type of}} soil, the crops meant to be grown and tanks or wells to be excavated for irrigation. Inscriptions mention wet land, cultivable land, forest and waste land. There are numerous references to hamlets (palli) belonging to the hunter communities who resided in them (bedapalli). From the 6th century onwards, the inscriptions refer to feudal lords by the title arasa. The arasas were either brahmins or from tribal background who controlled hereditary territories paying periodic tribute to the king. The velavali who were loyal bodyguards of the royalty were fierce warriors <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> (vele). They moved with the royal family and were expected to fight for the master and be willing to lay down their lives in the process. If the king died, the velavali were required to self immolate on the funeral pyre of the master.|$|E

5|$|Peter then {{returned}} to Constantinople with letters from Theodahad and the Roman Senate to the imperial couple, bearing pleas for a peaceful solution, {{but by the time}} he reached the imperial capital, Emperor Justinian had resolved on war and was preparing his forces. Consequently, Peter returned to Italy in the summer of 535 conveying an ultimatum: only if Theodahad abdicated and returned Italy to imperial rule, could war be averted. A two-pronged Byzantine offensive followed soon thereafter, attacking the outlying possessions of the Ostrogothic kingdom: Belisarius took Sicily, while Mundus invaded Dalmatia. Upon hearing these news, Theodahad despaired, and Peter was able to secure wide-ranging concessions from him: Sicily was to be ceded to the Byzantine Empire; the Gothic king's authority within Italy was severely restricted; a gold crown was to be sent as an annual tribute and up to 3,000 men were to be provided for the imperial army, underlining Theodahad's subject status. Theodahad, however, fearing that his first offer would be rejected, then instructed Peter, <b>under</b> <b>oath,</b> to offer the cession of all Italy, but only if the original concessions were rejected by Justinian. In the event, Justinian rejected the first proposal, and was delighted to learn of the second one. Peter was sent back to Italy with Athanasius, bearing letters to Theodahad and the Gothic nobles, and for a time it seemed as if the cradle of the Roman Empire would return peacefully to the fold. It was not to be: upon their arrival in Ravenna, the Byzantine envoys found Theodahad in a changed disposition. Supported by the Gothic nobility and buoyed up by a success against Mundus in Dalmatia, he resolved to resist, and imprisoned the ambassadors.|$|E
