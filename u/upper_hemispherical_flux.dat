The robotic {{system is a}} 5 -DOF manipulator that can be installed above a patient to make an <b>upper</b> <b>hemispherical</b> workspace centered in a target point. In {{order to determine the}} optimal lengths of the link, we consider the requirements for the workspace of a linear accelerator for radiosurgery. A more suitable kinematic structure than conventional industrial manipulators is proposed, and the kinematic analysis is also provided.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the presence and}} related signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of rod-shaped bacteria on a produce surface using elastic scattering. The theoretical noise {{was defined as a}} scattering signal from a rough produce surface while the signal was defined as a scattering signal from the increasing numbers of rod-shaped bacteria on the produce surface. In this research, we measured the surface topography of a tomato using BioAFM to provide the quantitative nature of the surface roughness which was, in turn, modeled with the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) for an accurate estimation of the background scattering signature. Then we included the DDA model of rod-shaped bacteria and calculated the combined elastic scattering signature in the <b>upper</b> <b>hemispherical</b> space with different polarizations, wavelengths, and incident angles. The total scattering cross-section (TSC) and partial scattering cross-section (PSC) were both computed on six predefined aperture locations. The results indicate that, upon proper selection of the wavelength and incident angle, it was possible to provide the minimum number of bacteria (~ 32) to provide a differentiable elastic scattering signal from the produce surface...|$|R
40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has {{established}} the Constellation Program. The Constellation Program has defined {{one of its}} many goals as long-term lunar habitation. Critical {{to the design of}} a lunar habitat is an understanding of the lunar surface environment; of specific importance is the primary meteoroid and subsequent ejecta environment. The document, NASA SP- 8013 'Meteoroid Environment Model Near Earth to Lunar Surface', was developed for the Apollo program in 1969 and contains the latest definition of the lunar ejecta environment. There is concern that NASA SP- 8013 may over-estimate the lunar ejecta environment. NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office (MEO) has initiated several tasks to improve the accuracy of our understanding of the lunar surface ejecta environment. This paper reports the results of experiments on projectile impact into powdered pumice and unconsolidated JSC- 1 A Lunar Mare Regolith simulant targets. Projectiles were accelerated to velocities between 2. 45 and 5. 18 km/s at normal incidence using the Ames Vertical Gun Range (AVGR). The ejected particles were detected by thin aluminum foil targets strategically placed around the impact site and angular ejecta distributions were determined. Assumptions were made to support the analysis which include; assuming ejecta spherical symmetry resulting from normal impact and all ejecta particles were of mean target particle size. This analysis produces a <b>hemispherical</b> <b>flux</b> density distribution of ejecta with sufficient velocity to penetrate the aluminum foil detectors...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, a new {{technique}} for the measurement of the total <b>hemispherical</b> radiation <b>flux</b> and the convective flux was proposed. The proposed concept can be applied both to low and high heat flux levels, however it is particularly suitable for high temperature, harsh environments. The heat flux assessment {{is based on the}} temperature measurement in a porous disc crossed by a known cold gas stream. Different conceptions to determine the heat flux reaching the sensing element were proposed and discussed. The separation of the <b>hemispherical</b> incident radiation <b>flux</b> and total heat flux is achieved by the effect of the transpiration gas blown though the porous disc on the external boundary layer developing on the sensing element surface. Mathematical models representing the heat and mass transfer mechanisms in the instrument head were developed and solved. Design rules aiming the specification of the instrument characteristics {{in order to meet the}} required sensibility and accuracy were established with the help of the developed models. Several prototypes have been constructed based on the established rules. Three of those prototypes where chosen for experimental verification of the instrument performance acting as a radiometer, i. e., to measure radiation heat fluxes.

40|$|Comprehensive surface-based retrievals {{of cloud}} optical and microphysical {{properties}} {{were made at}} Taihu, a highly polluted site in the central Yangtze Delta region, during a research campaign from May 2008 to December 2009. Cloud optical depth (COD), effective radius (Re), and liquid water path (LWP) were retrieved from measurements made with a suite of ground-based and spaceborne instruments, including an Analytical Spectral Devices spectroradiometer, a multi␣lter rotating shadowband radiometer, a multichannel microwave radiometer profiler, and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Terra and Aqua satellites. Retrievals from zenith radiance measurements capture better the temporal variation of cloud properties than do retrievals from <b>hemispherical</b> <b>fluxes.</b> Annual mean LWP, COD, and Re are 115. 8 ± 90. 8 g/m 2, 28. 5 ± 19. 2, and 6. 9 ± 4. 2 microns. Over 90 % of LWP values are less than 250 g/m 2. Most of the COD values (> 90 %) fall between 5 and 60, and ~ 80 % of Re values are less than 10 microns. Maximum (minimum) values of LWP and Re occur in summer (winter); COD is highest in winter and spring. Raining and nonraining clouds have signi␣cant differences in LWP, COD, and Re. Rainfall frequency is best correlated with LWP, followed by COD and Re. Cloud properties retrieved from multiple ground-based instruments are also compared with those from satellite retrievals. On average, relative to surface retrievals, mean differences of satellite retrievals in cloud LWP, COD, and Re were - 33. 6 g/m 2 (- 26. 4 %), - 5. 8 (- 31. 4 %), and 2. 9 ␣m (29. 3 %) for 11 MODIS-Terra overpasses and - 43. 3 g/m 2 (- 22. 3 %), - 3. 0 (- 10. 0 %), and - 1. 3 ␣m (- 12. 0 %) for 8 MODIS-Aqua overpasses, respectively.

40|$|We {{present the}} design and {{evaluation}} of the Roly-Poly Mouse (RPM), a rolling input device that combines {{the advantages of the}} mouse (position displacement) and of 3 D devices (roll and rotation) to unify 2 D and 3 D interaction. Our first study explores RPM gesture amplitude and stability for different <b>upper</b> shapes (<b>Hemispherical,</b> Convex) and hand postures. 8 roll directions can be performed precisely and their amplitude is larger on Hemispherical RPM. As minor rolls affect translation, we propose a roll correction algorithm to support stable 2 D pointing with RPM. We propose the use of compound gestures for 3 D pointing and docking, and evaluate them against a commercial 3 D device, the SpaceMouse. Our studies reveal that RPM performs 31 % faster than the SpaceMouse for 3 D pointing and equivalently for 3 D rotation. Finally, we present a proof-of-concept integrated RPM prototype along with discussion on the various technical challenges to overcome to build a final integrated version of RPM...|$|R

40|$|According to the {{importance}} of rehabilitation and recovery of Architectural Heritage in the live of people, this paper is aimed to strengthen the traditional methods of stone vaults calculation taking advantage of the technological characteristics of the powerful program ANSYS Workbench. As an example of this, it could find out the possible pathologies that could arise during the construction history of the building. To limit this research, the upper vault of the main chapel of the Santiago parish church in Orihuela -Alicante- is selected as a reference which is a Jeronimo Quijano´s important building work in the XVI century in the Renaissance. Moreover, it is an innovative stone masonry vault that consists of 8 double intercrossed arches with each other and braced by severies. During the seventeenth century there was a lantern in the central cap and it is unknown why it was removed. Its construction could justify the original constructive solution with intercrossed arches that freed the center to create a more enlightened and comfortable presbytery. By similarity with other Quijano’s works, it is considered a small lantern drilling the central spherical cap. It is proposed to carry out a comparative study of it with different architectural solutions from the same period and based on several common parameters such as: a vault of square plant with spherical surround, intercrossed arches, a possible lantern, the dimension of the permitted space, similar states of loads and compact limestone masonry. The three solutions are mainly differentiated by their size and the type of lantern and its comparison lets us know which one is the most resistant and stable. The other two building works maintain some connection with the Quijano's professional scope. It has selected the particular case of the Communion chapel of the Basilica in Elche (a large prismatic lantern with a large cylindrical drum that starts from the own arches and an <b>upper</b> <b>hemispherical</b> dome), for its conservation, its proximity to Orihuela and its implementation during the century XVIII. Finally, a significant Dome Spanish Renaissance complete the selection: a cross vault of the Benavides Chapel of the Saint Francisco Convent in Baeza - Jaén-, designed by Andres of Vandelvira in the sixteenth century (a large hemispherical dome that starts from the own arcs). To simplify the calculation and standardize the work that have to be contrasted, all of them were considered with some similar characteristics: 30 cm constant thickness, the intercrossed arches were specifically analyzed and had identical loads, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. Regarding the calculation solutions, in general terms, the compressive stresses predominate, influencing on it the joint collaboration of the filling material on the vault, the vault itself, the thick side walls, the buttresses and the top cover weight. In addition, the three solutions are suitable, being the Orihuela one the safest and the Baeza one the riskiest for its large dimensions. Thus, the idea of intercrossed arches with suitable thickness would allow carry out the heaviest lantern and this would confirm it as a Renaissance architectural typology built in stone...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of aerosol radiative effect on broadband <b>hemispherical</b> solar <b>flux</b> is often performed using simplified spectral and directional scattering characteristics of atmospheric aerosol and underlying surface reflectance. In {{this study we}} present a rigorous yet fast computational tool that accurately accounts for detailed variability of both spectral and angular scattering properties of aerosol and surface reflectance in calculation of direct aerosol radiative effect. The tool is developed {{as part of the}} GRASP (Generalized Retrieval of Aerosol and Surface Properties) project. We use the tool to evaluate instantaneous and daily average radiative efficiencies (radiative effect per unit aerosol optical thickness) of several key atmospheric aerosol models over different surface types. We then examine the differences due to neglect of surface reflectance anisotropy, nonsphericity of aerosol particle shape and accounting only for aerosol angular scattering asymmetry instead of using full phase function. For example, it is shown that neglecting aerosol particle nonsphericity causes mainly overestimation of the aerosol cooling effect and that magnitude of this overestimate changes significantly as a function of solar zenith angle (SZA) if the asymmetry parameter is used instead of detailed phase function. It was also found that the nonspherical–spherical differences in the calculated aerosol radiative effect are not modified significantly if detailed BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function) is used instead of Lambertian approximation of surface reflectance. Additionally, calculations show that usage of only angular scattering asymmetry, even for the case of spherical aerosols, modifies the dependence of instantaneous aerosol radiative effect on SZA. This effect can be canceled for daily average values, but only if sun reaches the zenith; otherwise a systematic bias remains. Since the daily average radiative effect is obtained by integration over a range of SZAs, the errors vary with latitude and season. In summary, the present analysis showed that use of simplified assumptions causes systematic biases, rather than random uncertainties, in calculation of both instantaneous and daily average aerosol radiative effect. Finally, we illustrate application of the rigorous aerosol radiative effect calculations performed as part of GRASP aerosol retrieval from real POLDER/PARASOL satellite observations...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to investigate the macroscopic thermal behaviour of 2 m diameter Jet A fires in crosswinds of 3 m/s to 13 m/s. Two scenarios were considered: with and without a 2. 7 m diameter, 10. 8 m long, blocking object situated 3. 4 m downwind of the fire. These scenarios simulated transportation accidents with the fire representing a burning pool of aviation fuel and the object simulating an aircraft fuselage. To date, {{the limited number of}} experiments that have been conducted to examine wind effects on fire behaviour have been performed at small scale, which does not fully simulate the physics of large fires, or in outdoor facilities, with poorly controlled wind conditions. This thesis presents the first systematic characterization of the thermal environment in a large, turbulent fire under controlled wind conditions, with and without a large downwind blocking object. In experiments without the object, flame geometry was measured using temperature contour plots and video images, and the results compared to values predicted using published correlations. Results were greatly affected by the method used to measure flame geometry and by differences in boundary conditions between experiments. Although the presence of the blocking object prevented direct measurement of flame geometry due to interaction between the fire plume and object, temperature and heat flux measurements were analyzed to describe overall effects of the object on fire plume development. The fire impinged on the blocking object at wind speeds below 7 m/s and interacted with the low-pressure wake region behind the object. Laboratory-scale experiments were also conducted to examine the responses of different heat flux gauges to controlled heating conditions simulating those found in wind-blown fires. Schmidt-Boelter, Gardon and <b>Hemispherical</b> Heat <b>Flux</b> gauges and a Directional Flame Thermometer were exposed to a convective flow and to radiation from a cone calorimeter heater. Measurements were influenced by differences between the calibration and measurement environments, differences in sensor surface temperature, and unaccounted thermal losses from the sensor plate. Heat flux results from the fires were consistent with those from the cone calorimeter, but were additionally affected by differences in location relative to the hot central core of the fire...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} {{mechanisms}} by which granitic magmas rise through the crust to be empiaced at a level above their source, with particular reference to diapirisni. and how these mechanisms may be analysed by combined structural and petrological studies. The Northern Arran granite is used {{as an example of how}} this problem may be approached. The Northern Arran granite is a two component granite of Tertiary age intruded into structurally heterogeneous upper crustal rocks under regional tension. A synform concentric to the granite, synchronous with the development of a narrow thermal aureole, records the vertical ascent of a single body of magma with a <b>hemispherical</b> <b>upper</b> surface. Post ascent, radial expansion of this body, indicated by flattening strains parallel to its surface and superimposed on the concentric synform records a change in shape of the pluton. This was permitted by the reactivation of an existing fault which the pluton intersected during its ascent. Petrological studies of the outer coarse unit of the northern granite indicate that it is a single body of magma derived by differentiation of a crustally contaminated basaltic source. Theoretical modelling of the crystallisation of the coarse granite shows that textural and chemical variations, are consistent with solidification by sidewall crystallisation (liquid fractionation) but not fractional crystallisation. The inner (younger) fine granite is also a single body of magma derived from the same or a similar source as the coarse granite. The sharp undeformed contacts between the coarse and fine granites and the presence of internal sheets in the fine granite parallel to its contacts with the coarse granite are consistent with emplacement of the fine granite as a series of pulses which filled a propagating ring dyke fracture within the coarse granite. Theoretical modelling of the ascent of the coarse granite using the Hot Stokes equation indicates that bouyancy driven ascent aided by a reduction in wall rock viscosity controlled by the rate of heat loss of from the granite is a viable ascent mechanism. The patterns of strain in the aureole of the Northern Arran granite result from the ascent and emplacement of a single diapiric body. They provide examples of the types of structure which may be used to recognise and distinguish between diapiric ascent and radial expansion. This has important implications for the study of ballooning diapirs. The reactivation of an existing fault system during emplacement suggests that existing crustal structure can influence the final geometry of an intrusive body. It is shown that the complete evolution of the Northern Arran granite can be determined using a combination of structural and petrological data. Structural data provides constraints on the later stages of ascent and the emplacement of granitic plutons. Petrological data can be used to constrain the origin, early stages of ascent and the crystallisation of a magma body...|$|R
