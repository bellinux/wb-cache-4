We found that rice straw addition in anoxic Fuyang (F) rice field soil stimulated CH 4 production from SOM {{at the expense of}} CO 2, whereas in Uruguay (<b>U)</b> <b>soil</b> it suppressed SOM degradation to CO 2 plus CH 4 (negative PE). Reciprocal inoculation experiments with non-sterile and sterile soils showed that the soils always displayed the effect of rice straw characteristic for the live microbial community rather than for the soil physicochemical properties. Pyrosequencing of 16 S rRNA genes showed that bacterial communities in these soil samples were separated into two clusters (F and U). Symbiobacterium was abundant or dominant in microbiota from <b>U</b> <b>soil,</b> but negligible in those from F soil. Network analysis indicated that the bacterial populations involved in SOM decomposition were different between soils of F and U clusters; moreover, they were more tightly connected to methanogens in U than in F clusters. Ultimately, our results suggested that the PE of rice straw is mediated by the composition and activity of soil microbial community...|$|E

40|$|Widespread use of {{depleted}} uranium (DU) in munitions {{around the world}} has raised questions about contamination of soils, water and vegetation with uranium (U). However, understanding of processes controlling the fate and behaviour of <b>U</b> in <b>soils</b> is poor. The aim {{of this research was}} to investigate the contributions of abiotic and biotic processes to <b>U</b> transport in <b>soils,</b> by measuring transport in well-controlled experimental systems, and comparing the results with predictions of models of solute transport and reaction. Investigating the role of abiotic processes is challenging due to the complex speciation chemistry of <b>U</b> in <b>soil</b> solutions, sorption reactions with soil surfaces, and the kinetics of local equilibration with soil particles. To simplify the system, the self- diffusion of 235 U against 238 U isotopes was considered, such that speciation and sorption environments were constant. Rates of self-diffusion of these isotopes were measured in four contrasting soils, together with the components of the <b>soil</b> <b>U</b> diffusion coefficient. The results showed that U diffusion was controlled by sorption processes in all the soils, and that slow local-equilibration processes had a major effect. The concentration-distance profiles of <b>U</b> in the <b>soils</b> could not be explained with a simple model assuming instantaneous solid:solution equilibration, and some U spread far further than predicted for equilibrium sorption. Differences in U sorption between the soils were not simply related to differences in soil pH, clay content, CEC or mineralogy. To investigate biotic effects, rates of bulk diffusion of U were measured in sterilised soil, and soil in which prokaryotes or eukaryotes were inhibited by biocides. Slow local-equilibration processes were again found to affect diffusion, but transport was also somewhat increased by biotic processes, hypothesised to be due to differences in CO 2 pressure arising from microbial activity and thereby U speciation. This has implications for the effects of perturbation on rates of <b>U</b> transport through <b>soil.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Both types of organic fertilizer and GH reduced the relative abundance of amoeba whereas increased relative abundance of flagellate in experiment. However, relative abundance of amoeba in the three treatments have occupied the overall majority. This result was positively related to the high level of phosphorus in this experiments which probably suppressed fungi thus increasing the food resources for bacterivorous protozoa, especially in flagellate. The GH and organic fertilizer treatments remarkably increased the overall abundance of protozoa.

40|$|Reducing the tillage of {{agricultural}} soils can increase early-season crop-P uptake. Consistent increases in plant-P {{have been found}} in both field- and laboratory-systems with undisturbed (U) compared to disturbed (D) soil. A concomitant stimulatory effect on colonization of roots in <b>U</b> <b>soil</b> by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi has been found in some cases, but in others the colonization has been similar in U and D treatments. Disruption of the extraradical mycelium that remains from the previous crop is the mechanism by which soil disturbance restricts mycorrhizally mediated P uptake for the subsequent crop, with a tandem change in colonization not necessary, but sometimes seen. Nonetheless, a complete account of these processes will need an understanding of the conditions under which the extent of colonization is affected. Soil-P does not explain when a difference in colonization will appear. Among ecosystems in Western Australia, high inoculum density in a pasture was reported previously to preclude the appearance of a difference in colonization in response to soil disturbance, whereas for other ecosystems with lower inoculum densities a difference in colonization was seen. Here, we determined if a similar mechanism operates for an agricultural soil collected mid-season during the growth of a maize (Zea mays L.) crop in Ontario, Canada. Blending various proportions of pasteurized and non-pasteurized soil gave a range of inoculum densities. Maize was taken through two 3 -week growth cycles in pots, and for the D treatment the soil was passed through a 5 mm sieve between cycles. All plants became colonized with AM fungi.

The common features and dissimilarities in the origin and nature of street dust were investigated through a series of studies in two widely different cities, Madrid (Spain) and Oslo (Norway), between 1990 and 1994. The most comprehensive sampling campaign was carried out in the Norwegian capital during the summer of 1994. An area of 14 km 2, covering most of downtown Oslo and some residential districts {{to the north of the}} city, was divided into 1 km 2 mapping units, and 16 sampling increments of approximately 150 g were collected from streets and roads in each of them. The fraction below 100 μm was acid-digested and analysed by ICP-MS. Statistical analyses of the results suggest that chemical elements in street dust can be classified into three groups: “urban” elements (Ba, Cd, Co, Cu, Mg, Pb, Sb, Ti, Zn), “natural” elements (Al, Ga, La, Mn, Na, Sr, Th, Y) and elements of a mixed origin or which have undergone geochemical changes from their original sources (Ca, Cs, Fe, Mo, Ni, Rb, Sr, <b>U).</b> <b>Soil</b> resuspension and/or mobilisation appears to be the most important source of “natural” elements, while “urban” elements originate primarily from traffic and from the weathering and corrosion of building materials. The data for Pb seem to prove that the gradual shift from leaded to unleaded petrol as fuel for automobiles has resulted in an almost proportional reduction in the concentration of Pb in dust particles under 100 μm. This fact and the spatial distribution of Pb in the city strongly suggest that lead sources other than traffic (i. e. lead accumulated in urban soil over the years) may contribute as much lead, if not more, to urban street dust...|$|E

It is also suggested that the migration of uranium in soils in the presence of HA can be either accelerated by formation of the humic compounds or partly retarded by sorption of humic compounds.

40|$|Ranger Uranium Mine (RUM) is {{situated}} in the wet-dry tropics of Northern Australia. Land application (irrigation) of stockpile (ore and waste) runoff water to natural woodland on the mine lease is {{a key part of}} water management at the mine. Consequently, the soil in these Land Application Areas (LAAs) presents a range of uranium (U) and other metals concentrations. Knowledge of seasonal and temporal changes in <b>soil</b> <b>U</b> and physicochemical parameters at RUM LAAs is important to develop suitable management and rehabilitation strategies. Therefore, soil samples were collected from low, medium, high and very high U sites at RUM LAAs for two consecutive years and the effect of time and season on soil physicochemical parameters particularly U and other major solutes applied in irrigation water was measured. Concentrations of some of the solutes applied in the irrigation water such as sulphur (S), iron (Fe) and calcium (Ca) showed significant seasonal and temporal changes. Soil S, Fe and Ca concentration decreased from year 1 to year 2 and from dry to wet seasons during both years. <b>Soil</b> <b>U</b> followed the same pattern except that we recorded an increase in <b>soil</b> <b>U</b> concentrations at most of the RUM LAAs after year 2 wet season compared to year 2 dry season. Thus, these sites did not show a considerable decrease in <b>soil</b> <b>U</b> concentration from year 1 to year 2. Sites which contained elevated U after wet season 2 also had higher moisture content which suggests that pooling of U containing rainwater at these sites may be responsible for elevated U. Thus, U may be redistributed within RUM LAAs due to surface water movement. The study also suggested that a decrease in U concentrations in LAA soils at very high U (> 900 mg kg− 1) sites is most likely due to transport of particulate matter bound U by surface runoff and U may not be lost from the surface soil due to vertical movement through the soil profile. Uranium attached to particulate matter may reduce its potential for environmental impact.

Uranium and many other elements (e. g., As, Bi, Cu, Sn, W) were found in high total concentrations, however the risk assessment code indicates a potentially hazardous situation in the mine site only for U pollution...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Hydrology {{modelling}} {{has developed}} and this useful for {{water resources management}} basic data. This study intends to predicate direct runoff. Method which is used {{is one that has}} been developed by <b>U.</b> S. <b>Soil</b> Conservation Service, now (Natural Resources Conservation Service, NRCS). The SCS method calculates physical condition of Catchment Area as an input in hydrology analysis. Parameter used in this method is land cover and soil type, then the physical condition to be translated into index reflecting direct run off potential called curve number. The result of this study indicates that applied Soil Conservation Service (SCS) model in the Bantimurung Catchment area to predicate the volume of direct run-off become over estimate with amount of 22. 92 % in predicting maximum discharge...|$|R
