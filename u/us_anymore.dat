It was originally set for May 2010, but was subsequently pushed back to late August or early September. It was finally completed in October 2010 with the installation of a decorative ship mast structure at the Durand Boulevard roundabout. Following the project's completion, NY590 was truncated to Titus Avenue and ownership and maintenance of Sea Breeze Drive was transferred to the town of Irondequoit. According to New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) official Rick Papaj, the state turned Sea Breeze Drive over to the town because the portion of NY590 north of Titus Avenue had low traffic volumes and was situated in a residential area. Papaj added, [...] " [...] didn't make sense (to <b>us)</b> <b>anymore.</b> 590 effectively ends at Route104." ...|$|E

Protestors converged outside the hospital where Feng was staying, carrying a banner that read [...] "severely beat the traitors and expel them." [...] Local media reported that the local government had organized the protest. [...] About a dozen guards patrolled outside Feng's hospital room for two weeks, following family members wherever they went. [...] "We feel like prisoners," [...] remarked Deng Jicai.

[...] A spokesperson for the Shaanxi provincial government called the allegations of harassment unfounded rumors. [...] However, Liang Zhongtang, an independent researcher, said it was common for people who seek outside help to be harassed by local governments. He speculated that the township government was trying to prevent further {{media coverage of the}} case. [...] On July 13, Jiyuan said that he remained concerned over his family's future safety, noting: [...] "There are rumors on the street that after this thing calms down, when people are not paying attention to <b>us</b> <b>anymore,</b> they [...] will kill my family." ...|$|E

5000|$|After this, AEY {{continues}} to secure larger deals {{and make more}} money, even moving into a larger office and hiring more employees, and David's daughter Ella is born. Efraim, however, {{continues to}} grow more unstable and untrustworthy, as the company is suddenly {{given a chance to}} land their biggest deal yet. Known as [...] "The Afghan Deal", the US Government wishes to arm the Afghan military for the long-term, and post a massive order worth $300 million, which includes 100 million rounds of AK-47 ammunition and would have netted the war dogs a $100 million profit. Filling this order proves to be near-impossible for such a relatively small company, particularly in that there is a global shortage on AK-47 ammunition, but the two end up lucking into an encounter with legendary US arms dealer Henry Girard. Girard has access to the massive weapon storages that were created in Albania but never used, and must now be disposed of in accordance with NATO treaties, which includes well over a hundred million rounds of AK-47 ammunition. Girard can not directly deal with the <b>US</b> Government <b>anymore,</b> due to being on a watchlist, and wants to make the deal through AEY. Efraim agrees, although David expresses discomfort working with a man who is on a terrorist watchlist.|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} a fashion {{over the last two}} or three decades to claim that {{political}} party is in decline in the US politics, as ample evidence, the aforesaid argument goes, suggests believing so. According to the claimants in favor of party decline, political party’s role has been diminishing in the political processes, including the presidential and congressional elections. Some even goes further, asserting that political party is over in the US. This extreme view suggests that political party is not a useful tool in the <b>US</b> politics <b>anymore.</b> In this regard, it is asserted that the Political Action Committees (PACs) have successfully supplanted the political parties, making them outdated and unnecessary. Since candidates are not dependent on political parties in order to get elected, parties have become less and less significant and relevant. It is, however, the objective of this study to demonstrate that political party still plays a significant role in many processes of American politics. The evidence that is presented as the sign of party decline in fact suggests that political party in the US is transforming, rather than declining. Therefore, political parties are well and alive in the US. It is further argued that although the new political environment is more candidate-centered than it used to be, this does not necessarily mean that political parties are declining in the US...|$|R

Stay strong Israel, January 20 is fast approaching!". The passage, and the United States' decision to abstain rather than veto it, is controversial in the United States, which has used its veto power 42 times to protect Israel, including with respect to a very similar resolution in 2011. In reaction to the United States' abstention, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan stated that the abstention was [...] "absolutely shameful" [...] and a [...] "blow to peace". Incoming Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer said it was [...] "extremely frustrating, disappointing and confounding" [...] that the Obama administration failed to veto the UN's vote. The American organization J Street said [...] "the resolution is consistent with long-standing bipartisan American policy, which includes strong support for the two-state solution, and clear opposition to irresponsible and damaging actions, including Palestinian incitement and terror and Israeli settlement expansion and home demolitions." [...] The United States House of Representatives, on the other hand, voted 342-80 to condemn the UN Resolution on January 5, 2017.|$|R

It was Newcastle's sixth successive victory and their fourth away from home in a row. Afterwards, Keegan said [...] "We look more resilient. No one's calling <b>us</b> entertainers <b>anymore</b> - we're more like grinders now. We're sticking the odd chance away and defending well. Which you (the press) won't want to write because you like saying how badly we defend." [...] Newcastle's next fixture was at home to champions Manchester United on 20 October 1996. Despite their impressive league form, the pre-match focus remained on apparent defensive shortcomings, with writer Neil Harman claiming [...] "The achilles heel of Newcastle's extravagant attempt to wrest the Premiership from Manchester United is a defence which, at moments of pressure, tends to react {{like a bunch of}} frisky colts. Defend like that against Manchester United tomorrow and they are surely done for. Newcastle continue to resemble a defensive sow's ear, with no silk purse in sight." [...] Keegan ignored the criticism and sent his side out with his usual instructions to entertain and the result for his team was [...] "their crowning achievement, a sign that their swashbuckling football that had lost them the title in tragi-comic circumstances the previous seasons could endure." [...] First-half goals from Peacock and Ginola saw the home side lead 2-0 at the interval before further goals from Ferdinand, Shearer and a lob over Schmeichel by Albert [...] - [...] described by writer Steve Millar as [...] "magnificent; fit to win any game" [...] - [...] gave Newcastle a comprehensive 5-0 win. Keegan claimed the result was revenge for the Charity Shield defeat, claiming [...] "`This is my most satisfying day as a manager. I tell our players our fans expect miracles and we try to provide them. Today we were near to giving them one. After what happened last season and the Charity Shield, today's win was for our fans. My players went out today with my reminder of the Charity Shield ringing in their ears.

5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Until We Meet Again, Murray {{announced}} that the band would continue working on new music, leading up to a release of a full-length album. In July 2014, the band announced that they would reconvene to work on more material in August. In September, the band provided an update that they were working on writing more music, making plans to record material, and practicing for live shows. In November, Fahnstock revealed that he had been recording bass parts for six new songs, and shortly after it was announced that the band was aiming for a release for sometime in 2015. The band later announced that the full-album release was pushed back to 2016. Hunt explained the reasons for the delay:We have been working on new material now {{for the better part of}} a year. We have got some really cool stuff and it is certainly much different than anything I have ever been a part of. I think that we have got a deal in play right now, and I cannot say what it is yet, but it is not from America, it is for overseas. We are still working on America. For America, it is a new band, which you know is hard to break here as a Rock band. It is really tough, and I guess the thing is, with White Noise Owl, we are just looking for the right situation. None of <b>us</b> are young <b>anymore,</b> none of <b>us</b> can say, 'Hey, let’s just hop in the van and eat bologna sandwiches and try and break our band that way', that is just not realistic. We are taking our time with it, we are not in any hurry at all, and I think that the thing is, that the way that we carry ourselves about it, that it is kind of this open ended thing. We are hoping that this deal that I am talking about will allow us to go tour overseas for a little bit." [...] In January 2016, the band revealed that the record deal previously referred to had been in reference to signing to Warner Music of New Zealand. Final recording sessions for the album began on December 13, 2015 and went through the month of February, starting the mixing process on February 29, 2016.
