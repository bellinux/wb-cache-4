The <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>transmitters</b> induce cavitation in the electrolyte {{in the vicinity of}} the palladium cathode for in-situ cleaning and activation of the cathode surface, generation of dislocations, assistance in loading and excitation of the Pd-D system. The ultrasonically assisted electrolysis cells are described and excess heat generating experiments using these cells are illustrated. All of these experiments used the Dardik’s modified SuperWaves to drive the electrolysis. The reproducibility of excess heat generation obtained using the ultrasonically assisted electrolysis experiments approaches 80 %, which is the highest of all types of electrolysis experiments performed at Energetics Technologies. A significant amount of excess heat was generated and a very large Coefficient Of Performance (COP) was obtained in several experiments. The largest excess power obtained is 34 watts; the largest total excess energy is 3. 5 MJ; the largest COP achieved is 3000 %; and the longest duration of excess heat generation in a single experiment is 40 days. The largest amount of specific excess energy is 27 KeV per Pd or D atom. This is at least three orders of magnitude larger than the specific energy that can be generated by chemical reactions or that can be stored in the cell in the form of mechanical energy.

We then tested the weighted means analysis and a multiple regression analysis for estimating the transmitter positions. The relationship between the rate of signal receptions and the distance from each receiver were not always linear, probably because of bottom topography, and there were relatively large errors in both analyses.
