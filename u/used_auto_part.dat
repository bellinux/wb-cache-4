50|$|While {{there are}} 236 officially {{registered}} {{businesses in the}} colonia, {{there are an estimated}} 400 businesses dedicated to the sale of used car parts alone. These businesses have a reputation for selling parts from stolen cars. One {{reason for this is that}} a boom in stolen parts began in the 1970s, when chrome accessories such as bumpers and mirrors began to be replaced by cheaper and interchangeable plastic parts. The Unión de Comerciantes de Refacciones y Accesorios Nuevos y Usados para Autos y Camiones de la Colonia Buenos Aires says that this is not the case, that there exists a norm for the acquisition and sale of used auto parts. The government, too, has ceased to consider the area as a major focus for the traffic in stolen auto parts but the reputation persists. In the 2000s, there were efforts between the business association and the city government to help the <b>used</b> <b>auto</b> <b>part</b> market here but these talks fell though after then mayor Andrés Manuel López Obrador was told that the market here was primarily in stolen parts.|$|E

50|$|The {{area around}} Calzada de la Ronda {{is filled with}} stored selling mostly <b>used</b> <b>auto</b> <b>parts</b> as well as {{informal}} mechanics. This has caused problems for neighbors who complain that the businesses block sidewalks and streets with merchandise and cars under repair.

50|$|Born in Leiden, Netherlands, Kolff was {{the eldest}} {{of a family of}} 5 boys. Kolff studied {{medicine}} in his hometown at Leiden University, and continued as a resident in internal medicine at Groningen University. One of his first patients there was a 22-year-old man who was slowly dying of renal failure. This prompted Kolff to perform research on artificial renal function replacement. Also during his residency, Kolff organized the first blood bank in Europe (in 1940). Kolff's first prototype dialyzer was developed in 1943, built from orange juice cans, <b>used</b> <b>auto</b> <b>parts,</b> and sausage casings. Over a two year span, Kolff had attempted to treat 15 people with his machine, but all had died. In 1945, Kolff successfully treated his first patient, a 67 year old woman, from renal failure using his hemodialysis machine.|$|R

50|$|The {{area has}} a {{reputation}} for crime and has been the scene of a number of violent robberies and murders. In 2006, 25,000 pesos was robbed from a secondary school cooperative after a shootout with police in the streets of the colonia as the robbers tried to escape. In 2008, the third highest ranking police official in Mexico City, Hugo Moneda Range, was shot to death on the intersection of Calzada de los Misterios and Berlioz. In 2004, the Agencia Federal de Investigación, conducted raids in Peralvillo and other areas of the city to shut down establishments making illegal slot machines and illegally operating casinos. However, the major business in the area is the black market in autoparts. This business began in the late 1980s, when only twelve businesses selling used autoparts existed, and has expanded to over 9,000, with 90 to 95% of these selling stolen parts. Making Colonia Peralvillo and neighboring Colonia Hipodromo de Peralvillo one of the city's major areas for chop shops. However, genuine <b>used</b> <b>auto</b> <b>parts,</b> whether obtained illegally or not, are facing pressure from imitation parts made in Taiwan and other parts of Asia. This is making the stealing of automobiles less profitable.|$|R

However, although an aluminum alloy is lighter than steel, the elongation is smaller than that. Therefore, in press forming, some problems often occur. We have proposed use of explosive forming, in order to solve this problem.

40|$|Marketing {{is a very}} {{important}} function in business management and plays a vital role in the success of any organisation. But most of the research into marketing has focussed on large scale organisations which have the scale and motive to manage marketing activities. SMEs {{play a vital role in}} the almost all regional economies and also in the global economy. They are the backbone of a society and account for most of the employment and productivity in any country. Yet, research into management of SMEs is quite limited. It is widely believed that business management approaches of SMEs and large scale organisations vary a lot and marketing function is one of these aspects which is different between SMEs and large scale organisation. Nevertheless, the significance of marketing cannot be ignored. This research investigates the marketing strategies of SMEs in developing nations <b>using</b> <b>auto</b> <b>part</b> manufacturers in the Indian State of Punjab as case study. This research uses a mixed research strategy and data was collected using structured questionnaires and semi structured interviews. This research finds that the SMEs mainly rely on word of mouth marketing and relationship marketing. SMEs tend not to use mass media for advertising and SMEs in developing countries also lack the usage of electronic media for marketing purposes. This research also finds that the main focus of SME’s marketing strategy in developing nations are the intermediaries and not the end consumers because intermediaries play a vital role in the purchase decision of the consumer as the end consumers are information poor...|$|R

40|$|Spheroidal {{graphite}} {{cast irons}} are widely <b>used</b> for <b>auto</b> <b>parts</b> {{because they have}} large degrees of freedom in shape and are inexpensive. When they are welded, however, they show serious drawback of crack generation due to excess carbon at thehardened region of heat-affected zone. We have studied on decarburized {{spheroidal graphite cast iron}} which has a possibility of welding because of graphite free in the surface region. In the present study, some characteristics of the decarburized layer in the spheroidal graphite cast iron were investigated. The results obtained are as follows. Growth of decarburized layer is controlled by diffusion of carbon atoms toward the surface region in the iron during the heat-treatment and there is a critical temperature of 930 K for the decarburization, below which decarburization does not occur. When the area ratios of the decarburized layer to whole sectional area in the rod-shaped tensile test specimen was defined to be a ratio of decarburized layer, the tensile strength of the specimen scarcely influenced by the ratio of decarburized layer. However, when the overdecarburization was processed, the tensile strength showed a tendency to decrease. Therefore, it should be noted in practical use of the decarburized spheroidal graphite cast iron that the excessive decarburization makes the strength of thin parts of the iron to decrease...|$|R
5000|$|The {{question}} of when an off road [...] "go-kart" [...] becomes an off road [...] "buggy" [...] or when a dune buggy becomes an off road buggy or {{even if there is}} any difference will no doubt elicit many opinions and responses.
