On the former hypothesis, for example, the teeth of the foetal Balæna have a meaning; on the latter, none. So far as we are aware, there is not a phrase in the [...] "Origin of Species," [...] inconsistent with Professor Kölliker's position, that [...] "varieties arise irrespectively of the notion of purpose, or of utility, according to general laws of Nature, and may be either useful, or hurtful, or indifferent." ...|$|E

If, having certain funds for supporting labour at my disposal, I pay men merely to keep my ground in order, my money is, in that function, spent once for all; but if I pay them to dig iron out of my ground, and work it, and sell it, I can charge rent for the ground, and per-centage both on the manufacture and the sale, and make my capital profitable in these three bye-ways. The greater part of the profitable investment of capital, in the present day, is in operations of this kind, in which the public is persuaded to buy something of no <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> on production, or sale, of which, the capitalist may charge per-centage; the said public remaining all the while under the persuasion that the per-centages thus obtained are real national gains, whereas, they are merely filchings out of partially light pockets, to swell heavy ones.|$|E
6000|$|And that is {{just what}} too often the {{children}} of light forget. The children of light have a higher light, a deeper teaching from God, than {{the children of the}} world. They have a great insight into what ought to be; they see that mankind might be far wiser, happier, better, holier than they are; they have noble and lofty hopes for the future; they desire the welfare and the holiness of mankind. But they are too apt to want practical common sense. And so they are laughed at (and deservedly) as dreamers, as fanatics, as foolish unpractical people, who are wasting their talents on impossible fancies. Often while their minds are full of really useful and noble schemes, they neglect their business, their families, their common duties, till they cause misery to those around them, and shame to themselves. Often, too, they are tempted to be actually dishonest, to fancy that the means sanctify the end; that it is lawful to do evil that good may come; and so, in order to carry out some fine scheme of theirs, to say false things, or do mean or cruel things, not for their own interest, but, as they fancy, for the cause of God: as if God, and God's cause, could ever be helped by the devil and his works. [...] And so they cast a scandal on religion, and give the enemies of the Lord reason to blaspheme. So it was, it seems, in our Lord's time--so it has been too often since. The children of light--those who ought to be of most use to their own generation--are sometimes of least <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> through their own weaknesses and follies. They will not remember that he that is not faithful in that which is least, in the every-day concerns of life, {{is not likely to be}} faithful in that which is greatest; that if they will not be faithful in the unrighteous mammon--that is, if they cannot resist the temptations to meanness and unfairness which come with all money transactions, God will not commit to them the true riches--the power of making their fellow creatures wiser, happier, better. If they will not be faithful in that which is another man's--in plain English, if they will not pay their debts honestly, who will give them that which is their own--the inspiration of God's indwelling Spirit? Would to God all high religious professors would recollect that, and be just and honest, before they pretend to higher graces and counsels of perfection.|$|E

60|$|Now let us {{consider}} how this kind of protection must act. Tropical insectivorous birds very frequently sit on dead branches of a lofty tree, or on those which overhang forest paths, gazing intently around, and darting off at intervals to seize an insect at a considerable distance, which they generally return to their station to devour. If a bird began by capturing the slow-flying, conspicuous Heliconidæ, and found them always so disagreeable {{that it could not}} eat them, it would after a very few trials leave off catching them at all; and their whole appearance, form, colouring, and mode of flight is so peculiar, that {{there can be little doubt}} birds would soon learn to distinguish them at a long distance, and never waste any time in pursuit of them. Under these circumstances, it is evident that any other butterfly of a group which birds were accustomed to devour, would be almost equally well protected by closely resembling a Heliconia externally, as if it acquired also the disagreeable odour; always supposing that there were only a few of them among a great number of the Heliconias. If the birds could not distinguish the two kinds externally, and there were on the average only one eatable among fifty uneatable, they would soon give up seeking for the eatable ones, even if they knew them to exist. If, on the other hand, any particular butterfly of an eatable group acquired the disagreeable taste of the Heliconias while it retained the characteristic form and colouring of its own group, this would be really of no <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> whatever; for the birds would go on catching it among its eatable allies (compared with which it would rarely occur), it would be wounded and disabled, even if rejected, and its increase would thus be as effectually checked as if it were devoured. It is important, therefore, to understand that if any one genus of an extensive family of eatable butterflies were in danger of extermination from insect-eating birds, and if two kinds of variation were going on among them, some individuals possessing a slightly disagreeable taste, others a slight resemblance to the Heliconidæ, this latter quality would be much more valuable than the former. The change in flavour would not at all prevent the variety from being captured as before, and it would almost certainly be thoroughly disabled before being rejected. The approach in colour and form to the Heliconidæ, however, would be at the very first a positive, though perhaps a slight advantage; for although at short distances this variety would be easily distinguished and devoured, yet at a longer distance it might be mistaken for one of the uneatable group, and so be passed by and gain another day's life, which might in many cases be sufficient for it to lay a quantity of eggs and leave a numerous progeny, many of which would inherit the peculiarity which had been the safeguard of their parent.|$|E

40|$|Greetings Dear {{readers of}} TOJDE, I {{am pleased to}} inform you that in the 8 th year of TOJDE are {{appeared}} on your screen now as Volume 8, Number: 4. Ti is the last issue of the year 2007. As you volume (Number 3 was the special issue of TOJDE on “Web 2. 0 and Social Software in Distance Education” subject. I received many congrulation for this special issue from the subject expert and TOJDE readers. During 6 months I received more than 45 submissions. Some of them rejected by me for the reason that their subjects were not fit for TOJDE’s publishing content strategy, and some of them rejected by TOJDE’s editors. And others can be publish next year’s issues In this issue we published one notes for Editor, 13 articles, already one review (maybe I can update for one or two reviews in due course which I am waiting from my book reviewers), news and announcements for our readers. This time 24 authors from eighth different countries are placed in this issue. These published articles are from Australia, Gana, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Turkey, and UK. The first article of this issue is coming from Faculty of Education, Monash University, Victoria, AUSTRALIA. Article is entitled as “Globalization, Distance Education And Hegemonic Futures” and written by Dr. Glenn RUSSELL. He says in his paper that “Available options for distance educators can be understood in terms of instrumental and interpersonal axes that can potentially indicate the relative consideration that can be given to these factors. This approach is suggested as one way to understand available options {{at a time when there}} has been an apparent increase in instrumental approaches to distance education at the expense of interpersonal approaches and issues of social justice. While this problem is of concern, it is more appropriate to reflect on the unintended consequences of distance education for society and identify them than it is to uncritically oppose globalisation and its adherents” and discusse Distance education; globalisation; instrumentalism; null curriculum hegemony, Second article is from India and it is dealt with “Science Education Through Open And Distance Learning At Higher Education Level”, written by Dr. Amrita NIGAM and Dr. Vibha JOSHI from Indira Gandhi National Open University, INDIA. This paper examines an attempt to study the experiences of the open science learners of IGNOU on different aspect of the science higher education. Here a questionnaire was used to collect the data and responses from 81 students enrolled for B. Sc. from IGNOU were collected. The findings of the study reported that society has undergone drastic changes in the last few decades. The revolution led due to Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have widely affected all aspects of society. The emerging jobs require entirely new skills and competencies i. e., employment in BPOs or switching over to e-governance, e-Banking and e- based sectors. Even e-learning has made numerous expectations from teachers and other personnel. The use of ICTs in almost every field needs adequately trained workers so that they can work efficiently and effectively. The training and retraining avenues in the conventional system is grossly inadequate to cope up with the present and future demands. In this situation open and distance education is the available alternative. In the third article is about “Attidues of Graduate Students Toward Distance Education, Educational Technologies And Independent Learning”, written by Dr. Ozana URAL. Elementary Education Department, Atatürk Faculty of Education University of Marmara, TURKEY. She discusse in her paper the views of the doctoral students at traditional universities on the use of distance education systems and technologies and independent learning are determined. Findings indicate that doctoral students do not have a positive attitude towards the use of distance education systems and technologies, and they do not agree with the idea that distance education systems can support independent learning. The 4 th articles arrived from Universitas Terbuka, INDONESIA, on “A Provision Of Student Learning Support Services In A Large-Scale Distance Education System At Universitas Terbuka, Indonesia”, which is written by Aminudin ZUHAIRI, Irma ADNAN and Dina THAIB. This paper addresses the practice and experience of Universitas Terbuka (UT) in the provision of learning support services for students in a large-scale distance education system. The UT, which has a network of 37 regional offices and participating institutions, has challenges to provide and manage effective learning support system for more than 340, 000 students, residing in various locations of Indonesia, a country with diverse level of the quality in terms of transportation, communication and technological infrastructure and facilities. The fifth article came from GANA, the subject is “Wıdenıng Access To Tertıary Educatıon For Women In Ghana Through Dıstance Educatıon”, written by Olivia Adwoa Tiwaah Frimpong KWAPONG, University of Ghana, Institute of Adult Education. This paper explores the unique nature of DE for widening access to tertiary education most especially for women in Ghana and the issues to consider in the process. by the baseon women, ICTs, distance education, tertiary education cohcepts. The sixth article which is entitled as “REMOTE RF LABORATORY REQUIREMENTS: Engineers’ and Technicians’ Perspective”, written by Dr. Nergiz Ercil CAGILTAY, Dr. Elif Uray AYDIN and Dr. Ali KARA from Atilim University, Ankara, TURKEY This study aims to find out requirements and needs to be fulfilled in developing remote Radio Frequency (RF) laboratory. Remote laboratories are newly emerging solutions for better supporting of e-learning platforms and for increasing their efficiency and effectiveness in technical education. By this way, modern universities aim to provide lifelong learning environments to extend their education for a wider area and support learners anytime and anywhere when they need help. However, as far as the authors concern, there is no study investigating the requirements and needs of remote laboratories in that particular field in the literature. This study is based on electrical engineers’ and technicians’ perspectives on the requirements of a remote laboratory in RF domain. Its scope covers investigation of the participants’ perceptions toward computer mediated communication and it attempts to answer the questions: which studying strategies are preferred by the learners and what kind of RF laboratory content should be provided. The analysis of the results showed that, geographic independence, finding quickly the elements of past communication and temporal independence are declared as the most important advantages of computer-mediated communication. The seventh article is came from again Indira Gandhi National Open University, INDIA, on “Knowledge Management & Its Applications In Distance Education” subject written by Anurag SAXENA. I remember that he had written an article to TOJDE many years ago He hdeclares in his paper that Knowledge management (KM) can provide a university with an opportunity to integrate processes, facilitate collaboration, and form relationship across traditional organizational boundaries. It no longer stands that the most knowledgeable only will conquer; it has become that one who actually uses that knowledge will get the edge. KM provides the opportunities to rethink, recast and re-engineer. Present communication tries to build a framework for open universities to effectively use KM to maintain relationships with existing students and attracting new students, build high-valued knowledge assets, build a knowledge based value-chain to respond to the changing demands for education. The 8 th article is arrived to us MALAYSIA. The article which is entitled “THE NEED FOR PARTICIPATION IN OPEN AND DISTANCE EDUCATION: The Open University Malaysia Experience”, which written by Santhi RAGHAVAN Faculty of Business & Management and P. Rajesh KUMAR from Faculty of Science Open University Malaysia,MALAYSIA. Their paper provides an overview of adult learner participation in open and distance education by focusing participation needs based on selected socio-demographic variables such as age, years of working experience and monthly income. The related study involved a sample of 454 Open University Malaysia students from a number of learning centres located in different parts of the country. The study found that adult learners are generally below the age of 39, relatively not affluent, have less than 20 years of work experience and have a high need for participation. The highest need is professional advancement, followed closely by cognitive interest, and communication improvement while the lowest reported need is escapism/social stimulation. Age and work experience exhibited negative regression coefficients, indicating inverse associations with participation need. These results are comparable to the findings of previous research on the role of age, work experience and monthly income as factors determining participation in adult higher education. Next and the ninth article were sent to TOJDE by Dr. Muhammad Imran YOUSUFfrom University of Arid Agriculture, PAKISTAN. Title of paper is “Effectiveness Of Mobile Learning In Distance Education”. The main aim of his research is to better understand and measure students’ attitudes and perceptions towards the importance of mobile learning in distance education. Results of this survey clearly indicate that facilitating mobile learning can improve the entire distance education by enhancing ways of communication among distance learners, tutors and supporting staff. The biggest advantage of this technology is that it can be used anywhere, anytime and its usage is easy access to a larger number of distance learners. This study draws the preferences and the extant to which distance learners in Pakistan are use to mobile learning. The tenth article is written by four Nigerian academics from Covenant University Paper is titled as “The Prospects Of E-Examination Implementation In Nigeria” and written by Ayo C. K., Akinyemi I. O., Adebiyi A. A., Ekong U. O. This paper propose of this paper is looking for a model for e-Examination in Nigeria where all applicants are subjected to online entrance examination as a way of curbing the irregularities as proposed by the Joint Admissions Matriculation Board (JAMB), the body saddled with the responsibility of conducting entrance examinations into all the Nigerian universities. This model was designed and tested in Covenant University, one of the private universities in Nigeria. There were 120 questions drawn from English (30), Mathematics (30), General Science (20), Commercial Courses (20), and Religion Knowledge (20), all for one hour duration. Questionnaires were administered to the applicants at the end of the examination to assess their level of ICT literacy, ease of use of the system and the difficulties encountered. Findings revealed that the system has the potentials to eliminate some of the problems that are associated with the traditional methods of examination such as impersonation and other forms of examination malpractices. The system is easy to use and candidates can get <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> with time. The timing of examination can be spaced without compromising the quality and integrity of the examination. However, much is still desired if the system were to be adopted on a national scale, particularly in terms of infrastructural and manpower development. Similarly, the quest for e-Examination can fast track the development of e-Learning facilities in the country with improved access to education. The eleventh article is written by Qadir BUKHSH, Lecturer, Department of Education The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Pakistan on “Empowerment Of Women Through Distance Education In Pakistan”. The presented study was undertaken to highlight the gender disparities of Pakistan as well as at regional and international level. The study, measured the comparative outcome of formal and non-formal system of education in Pakistan. To achieve the desired goal, documentary analysis was considered appropriate. The number of schools and enrollment during the years 2001 to 2004 of the formal system for primary, middle and high level was considered and enrollment during the year 198 - 1999 and 2004 for Secondary School Certificate to Ph. D level of non-formal system was considered. Data was analyzed in term of percentage and average. It was found that enrollment of female is less than male in formal system while enrollment of female is higher than male in non-formal system of education in Pakistan. Next article is which numbered as 12, from again PAKISTAN. USA. Article is entitled as “A Study Of Student’s Attitude Towards Distance Teacher Education Programme In Pakistan”, written by Aijaz Ahmed GUJJAR, Lecturer, Federal College of Education, Muhammad Akhlaque Trained Under Graduate Teacher Federal Government Secondary School and Muhammad Rashid HAFEEZ Lecturer, Federal College of Education, Islamabad & Doctoral Scholar Department of English Bahauddin Zakariya University. The presented study was undertaken to measure the attitude of the students towards teacher training programmes through Distance Education offered by Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU), Islamabad, Pakistan. To achieve the said end, the descriptive method of research was considered appropriate. The population of the study consisted of the B. Ed. Students of AIOU. Three hundred students from the Sahiwal region were selected as sample for the study. Questionnaire was used as a Research tool to gather the relevant data. Data was analysed in terms of percentage and mean score. It was found that majority of the students appreciated the overall input of the programme though a few eyebrows were raised concerning the assessment of the assignmentsThe thirteenth and the last article is from Anadolu University, TURKEY, which is written by Dr. Ergun TUNCKAN entiled as STRUCTURAL DIMENSIONS AND FUNCTIONS OF STUDENT CENTERS IN THE OPEN EDUCATION FACULTY PRACTICES:Three Metropolis Sampling - Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir”. His paper tells The Open Education Faculty Students Centers have been offering many services to students in Turkey since 1982. Building up bridges between students and faculties; student’s centers have had technological improvements since 1998 and thereafter quality of services have been increased and services given to students at the student’s center have been variated by implementing a low-cost computer network. Operations of the student’s centers in The Open Education system, modifications taking place in the automation systems of the centers and qualifications of services given to students have been examined comprehensively in this article. I this issue already I am giving a place only one reviewing. This is CASES ON GLOBAL E-LEARNING PRACTICES: Successes and Pitfalls, edited by Sharma, R. C., & Mishra, S. (Eds.). Hershey, PA: Information Science Publishing. (ISBN 1 - 59904 - 340 - 8). And reviewed by Yavuz Akbulut, from Anadolu University, TURKEY. The book properly serves to the objective of providing learning opportunities through a set of case studies on e-learning application in different contexts. Practical experience and research-based information have been synthesized meticulously in almost all chapters. Except for slight deviations from the accepted format of the book and except for slight ambiguities stemming from language use, most parts are reader friendly. Moreover, the readers are able to locate relevant information checking specific headings and abstracts all of which are organized effectively. Thus, the book might also serve as a reference book to be used whenever and wherever it is necessary to ameliorate reflection in action. The conclusion section of the book is particularly helpful in understanding the guidelines on how to plan, design and implement e-learning. Besides, the section groups the guidelines into six subcategories each one sheltering insightful reflections. Practitioners who are interested in e-learning practices will be able to find invaluable information in this book all of which results from reflective practice. Thus, the book might really help the readers gain insights into what makes an e-learning endeavor effective along with successes and pitfalls regarding practices in question.
