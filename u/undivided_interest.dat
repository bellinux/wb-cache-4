He canvassed many of his farmer friends and customers for miles around Caledonia persuading them to invest in shares of a new milling firm. There were successful examples in other milling establishments. And so on Feb 16, 1892 The Caledonia Milling Company Limited received its provincial charter and in March, 1892 a Bargain and Sale was recorded: “William Scot and wife and Hugh Scott and wife to The Caledonia Milling Co. Ltd. Supposed flouring mill and an <b>undivided</b> <b>interest</b> in Dam #5 – 2 acres, 2 roods, 9 perches.” (A rood is the fourth part of an acre, and a perch is a land measure of 5 and a half yards).|$|E

Here in the country it is only a few idle boys or loafers that go a-fishing on a rainy day; but there it appeared as if every able-bodied man and helpful boy in the Bay had gone out on a pleasure excursion in their yachts, and all would at last land and have a chowder on the Cape. The gazetteer tells you gravely how many of the men and boys of these towns are engaged in the whale, cod, and mackerel fishery, how many go to the banks of Newfoundland, or the coast of Labrador, the Straits of Belle Isle or the Bay of Chaleurs (Shalore the sailors call it); as if I were to reckon up the number of boys in Concord who are engaged during the summer in the perch, pickerel, bream, hornpout, and shiner fishery, of which no one keeps the statistics,--though I think that it is pursued with as much profit to the moral and intellectual man (or boy), and certainly with less danger to the physical one.|$|E
6000|$|The majority, {{the other}} four fifths, is {{perfectly}} sound, and of the best possible disposition to religion, to government, to the true and <b>undivided</b> <b>interest</b> of their country. Such men are naturally disposed to peace. They who are in possession of all they wish are languid and improvident. With this fault, (and I admit its existence in all its extent,) they would not endure to hear of a peace {{that led to the}} ruin of everything for which peace is dear to them. However, the desire of peace is essentially the weak side of that kind of men. All men that are ruined are ruined on the side of their natural propensities. There they are unguarded. Above all, good men do not suspect that their destruction is attempted through their virtues. This their enemies are perfectly aware of; and accordingly they, the most turbulent of mankind, who never made a scruple to shake the tranquillity of their country to its centre, raise a continual cry for peace with France. [...] "Peace with Regicide, and war {{with the rest of the}} world," [...] is their motto. From the beginning, and even whilst the French gave the blows, and we hardly opposed the vis inertiæ to their efforts, from that day to this hour, like importunate Guinea-fowls, crying one note day and night, they have called for peace.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{believed}} in Baslehurst that Mr. Bungall had not bequeathed his <b>undivided</b> <b>interest</b> in the concern to his nephew. Indeed people {{went so far}} as to say that he had left away from Mr. Tappitt all that he could leave. The truth in that respect may as well be told at once. His widow had possessed a third of the profits of the concern, in lieu of her right to a full half share in the concern, which would have carried with it the onus of a full half share of the work. That third and those rights she had left to her nephew,--or rather to her great-nephew, Luke Rowan. It was not, however, in this young man's power to walk into the brewery and claim a seat there as a partner. It was not in his power to do so, even if such should be his wish. When old Mrs. Bungall died at Dawlish at the very advanced age of ninety-seven, there came to be, as was natural, some little dispute between Mr. Tappitt and his distant connection, Luke Rowan. Mr. Tappitt suggested that Luke should take a thousand pounds down, and walk forth free from all contamination of malt and hops. Luke's attorney asked for ten thousand. Luke Rowan at the time was articled to a lawyer in London, and as the dinginess of the chambers which he frequented in Lincoln's Inn Fields appeared to him less attractive than the beautiful rivers of Devonshire, he offered to go into the brewery as a partner. It was at last settled that he should place himself there as a clerk for twelve months, drawing a certain moderate income out of the concern; and that if at the end of the year he should show himself to be able, and feel himself to be willing, to act as a partner, the firm should be changed to Tappitt and Rowan, and he should be established permanently as a Baslehurst brewer. Some information, however, beyond this has already been given to the reader respecting Mr. Rowan's prospects. [...] "I don't think he ever will be a partner," [...] Rachel had said to her mother, [...] "because he quarrels with Mr. Tappitt." [...] She had been very accurate in her statement. Mr. Rowan had now been three months at Baslehurst, and had not altogether found the ways of his relative pleasant. Mr. Tappitt wished to treat him as a clerk, whereas he wished to be treated as a partner. And Mr. Tappitt had by no means found the ways of the young man to be pleasant. Young Rowan was not idle, nor did he lack intelligence; indeed he possessed more energy and cleverness than, in Tappitt's opinion, were necessary to the position of a brewer in Baslehurst; but he was by no means willing to use these good gifts in the manner indicated by the sole existing owner of the concern. Mr. Tappitt wished that Rowan should learn brewing seated on a stool, and that the lessons should be purely arithmetical. Luke was instructed as to the use of certain dull, dingy, disagreeable ledgers, and informed that in them lay the natural work of a brewer. But he desired to learn the chemical action of malt and hops upon each other, and had not been a fortnight in the concern before he suggested to Mr. Tappitt that by a salutary process, which he described, the liquor might be made less muddy. [...] "Let us brew good beer," [...] he had said; and then Tappitt had known that it would not do. [...] "Yes," [...] said Tappitt, [...] "and sell for twopence a pint what will cost you threepence to make!" [...] "That's what we've got to look to," [...] said Rowan. [...] "I believe it can be done for the money,--only one must learn how to do it." [...] "I've been at it all my life," [...] Tappitt said. [...] "Yes, Mr. Tappitt; but it is only now that men are beginning to appreciate all that chemistry can do for them. If you'll allow me I'll make an experiment on a small scale." [...] After that Mr. Tappitt had declared emphatically to his wife that Luke Rowan should never become a partner of his. [...] "He would ruin any business in the world," [...] said Tappitt. [...] "And as to conceit!" [...] It is true that Rowan was conceited, and perhaps true also that he would have ruined the brewery had he been allowed to have his own way.|$|E

50|$|Unfortunately, {{this policy}} of {{promoting}} private ownership of land among the Sioux had disastrous consequences. Instead of working the land themselves, the Sioux sold, or more frequently leased, the lands to whites, and lived off the meager revenues. Worse yet, each successive generation found their parcels became splintered into multiple <b>undivided</b> <b>interests</b> in land, with many parcels having dozens (and in some cases, hundreds) of owners. Because {{the land was}} held in trust and often could not be alienated or partitioned, the fractionation problem grew steadily worse over time. Financial returns from the leased lands were divided up among so many parties that the holders of the fractionated interests would get as little as one cent from their holdings, and the administrative costs of bookkeeping and monitoring all of the fractional interests was economically unfeasible.|$|R

40|$|The {{structure}} of national continental systems of administrative law is typically {{determined by the}} classical notions of strict legal verticality and the <b>undivided</b> public <b>interest.</b> In the present era of individualization, privatization, decentralization and internationalization, these notions have come under increasing pressure. This article presents an analysis of Dutch administrative law as a case in point. How may a stable and legitimate system of judicial review of government actions take shape that responds to its modern context of ‘horizontalization’ and ‘fragmentation’, but still remains connected to its classical ideals of abstract right and the common good? In search for answers, this article first provides a theoretical and historical account of Dutch administrative law’s basic fundaments. Then, it presents an analysis of its recent ‘relational turn’, drifting away from its classical ‘autonomous’ focus on the lawful distribution of rights and goods among all members of society towards a modern ‘relational’ conception of administrative law that primarily concentrates on the settling of disputes between concrete parties. Ultimately, it proposes a way forward in which the ‘autonomous’ notions of legal verticality and the <b>undivided</b> common <b>interest</b> are still taken into consideration – embedded, to be sure, within a ‘relational’ and ‘pluralist’ theory of public law that acknowledges the ‘horizontalized’ and ‘fragmentized’ social and institutional context that {{it is supposed to}} regulate...|$|R
