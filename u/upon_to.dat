5|$|In 1865, the English {{economist}} William Stanley Jevons {{observed that}} technological improvements that increased {{the efficiency of}} coal-use led to the increased consumption of coal {{in a wide range}} of industries. He argued that, contrary to common intuition, technological progress could not be relied <b>upon</b> <b>to</b> reduce fuel consumption.|$|E
5|$|Minister James Snow {{was charged}} with violating the act, and called <b>upon</b> <b>to</b> resign. The Minister did not resign, but paid a $3,500 fine.

5|$|Sonic Unleasheds engine, the Hedgehog Engine, {{would later}} be refined for use with later titles in the franchise, such as Sonic Generations (2011) and Sonic Forces (2017).

40|$|Contemporary corporate-related {{human rights}} abuses are often {{attributed}} to the processes of neo-liberal globalisation. Pressures <b>upon</b> nations <b>to</b> compete in the global marketplace, <b>upon</b> suppliers <b>to</b> produce ever-cheaper and everfaster, <b>upon</b> workers <b>to</b> accept more precarious terms of employment and <b>upon</b> communities <b>to</b> give up land and natural resources, all {{in the pursuit of}} economic growth have unveiled examples of the darker side of business operations within the global economy. Whereas this side was more hidden and less susceptible to resistance in a different era, transnational activism in this age – with the aid of new forms of communication technology and media – has enabled greater public awareness of this miscreant behaviour and the ensuing injustices...|$|R

5|$|A {{few months}} later, {{at a party}} meeting, {{it was decided that}} {{administrative}} actions against the writers who openly expressed support of reformation would be taken. Since {{only a small part of}} the union held these beliefs, the remaining members were relied <b>upon</b> <b>to</b> discipline their colleagues. Control over Literární noviny and several other publishing houses was transferred to the Ministry of Culture, and even members of the party who later became major reformers — including Dubček — endorsed these moves.|$|E
5|$|According to Brelsford, {{the elderly}} Harrison Clark {{remained}} highly respected among {{the indigenous people}} and was sometimes called <b>upon</b> <b>to</b> settle disputes. His last job was personnel manager at a local mine. He dedicated his final years to the writing of {{a book about his}} life, the manuscript for which was lost when his house burned down. Clark alleged that the BSAC orchestrated the fire to stop him from publishing unflattering information about the early days of Company rule. He died from heart disease in Broken Hill on 9 December 1927, aged about 67, and was buried in the Protestant section of the town cemetery. The modest savings he possessed {{at the time of his}} death were left to his sister in Port Elizabeth.|$|E

5|$|After McDonnell {{had made}} 103 out of 158, Murdoch and Scott {{completed}} the first double-century partnership in Test cricket. England, as the score mounted, used 11 bowlers: {{the first time}} in Test cricket that an entire team including the wicketkeeper was called <b>upon</b> <b>to</b> bowl. On this occasion, the wicketkeeper Lyttelton was the most successful bowler, taking 4/19. Grace, keeping wicket to Lyttelton, took a catch to dismiss Midwinter.|$|E
5|$|As {{lieutenant}} governor, Collins {{presided over}} the state Senate. Members of both major parties praised Collins for her impartiality and knowledge of parliamentary procedure in this role. She was twice called <b>upon</b> <b>to</b> break tie votes in the Senate, once on a bill allowing the state's teachers to engage in collective bargaining and another on a bill to allow branch banking across county lines within the state; in both instances she voted in the negative, killing the bill. During her tenure, she also chaired the National Conference of Lieutenant Governors, becoming {{the first woman to}} hold that position. In 1982, she was named to the board of regents of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville.|$|E
5|$|As the BBC {{broadcasting}} {{unit was}} about to order another batch of the monitor, {{it was found that}} the supplier had modified the drive units, meaning the LS3/5 design had to be fundamentally revised.

Modifications were made to adapt to the new drive units and deal with the altered resonance pattern, and the LS3/5 became the LS3/5A.|$|E

5|$|At that time, many in Britain {{worried that}} coal {{reserves}} were rapidly dwindling, {{but some experts}} opined that improving technology would reduce coal consumption. Jevons argued that this view was incorrect, as further increases in efficiency would tend to increase the use of coal. Hence, improving technology would tend to increase {{the rate at which}} England's coal deposits were being depleted, and could not be relied <b>upon</b> <b>to</b> solve the problem.|$|E
5|$|Benchley {{enrolled}} at Harvard University in 1908, again with Duryea's financial help. He joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity {{in his first}} year, and continued to partake in the camaraderie that he had enjoyed at Phillips Exeter while still doing well in school. He did especially well in his English and government classes. His humor and style began to reveal themselves during this time: Benchley was often called <b>upon</b> <b>to</b> entertain his fraternity brothers, and his impressions of classmates and professors became very popular. His performances gave him some local fame, and most entertainment programs on campus and many off-campus meetings recruited Benchley's talents.|$|E
5|$|Chauvel began {{training}} his brigade {{upon arrival}} in Egypt. He was noted for insisting on {{high standards of}} dress and bearing from his troops. The 1st Light Horse Brigade became part of Major General Alexander Godley's New Zealand and Australian Division, along with the 4th Infantry Brigade, the New Zealand Infantry Brigade and New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. When {{the rest of the}} Australian and New Zealand Army Corps departed for Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, the mounted brigades remained in Egypt – the Gallipoli Peninsula being unsuited to mounted operations. Following heavy casualties {{in the early days of}} the Gallipoli Campaign, however, the light horse were called <b>upon</b> <b>to</b> provide 1,000reinforcements. The British commander in Egypt, Lieutenant General Sir John Maxwell, elected instead to ship the mounted brigades to Anzac Cove intact.|$|E
