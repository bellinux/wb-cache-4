Against her parents' wishes the couple were married on 1 July 1916, resulting in them threatening to disinherit her. The early days of Nagle's marriage were hard; she was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> wealthy lifestyle– her family money came from her father's successful business, Maypole Dairies– but her parents offered the couple no financial assistance. Nagle always worked hard and subsidised their income by making cream teas, cleaning windows and scrubbing toilets. The couple had two children, a son, David, and a daughter, Patricia.|$|E

Surface supplied heliox bounce divers will be provided with mixtures suitable for their current depth, and the mixture may be changed several times during descent and ascent from great depths.|$|E

5|$|The Comos' first child, Ronnie, {{was born}} in 1940 while the Weems band was working in Chicago.
