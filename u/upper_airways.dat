40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction: The mouth, the pharynx and {{the larynx}} are {{potential}} sites of aerosol deposition in the <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> during inhalation of aerosolized drugs. The right angle {{bend of the}} lumen {{at the back of}} the mouth, the position of the tongue, the variable size and shape of the lumen in the pharynx and the larynx, and the breathing pattern could increase aerosol deposition in the <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> and decrease lung deposition. Areas covered: In this review, the anatomy of the <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> from the oral cavity to the glottis and the impact of mandibular protrusion and incisal opening on the size of the <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> are highlighted. In addition, the impact of inhalation maneuvers, inhaler mouthpiece geometries and a stepped mouthpiece on the size of the <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> are discussed. Expert opinion: The structure of the <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> lumen does not have a fixed cross sectional area and is susceptible to both constriction and distension during inhalation. The size of the <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> can be enlarged through mandibular protrusion and/or incisal opening which might decrease aerosol deposition in the <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> and increase lung deposition...|$|R

Children have a greater ventilatory drive than adults. We therefore hypothesized that children have increased neuromotor activation of their pharyngeal airway during sleep compared to adults. As infants have few obstructive apneas during sleep, we hypothesized that infants would have an <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> that was resistant to collapse. We therefore compared the <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> pressure-flow relationship during sleep between normal infants, prepubertal children and adults.

Smokers are known to have an increased incidence of coughing and laryngospasm on induction of anaesthesia. The effect of cigarette smoking and the changes in the sensitivity of <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> reflexes which occur on stopping smoking were investigated. Benzodiazepines are commonly used for premedication and intravenously to produce sedation, the effects of these drugs on the sensitivity of <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> reflexes was examined as well as the effect of the reversal agent flumazenil. Patients who have consumed ethyl alcohol may readily aspirate gastric contents with fatal consequences. The effect of ethyl alcohol on the sensitivity of <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> reflexes is measured and the relevance to anaesthetists providing emergency anaesthesia is discussed. The inhalation of nitrous oxide and oxygen mixtures is frequently used for analgesic purposes in groups of patients known to have full stomachs and who are at risk from aspiration of gastric contents.

40|$|Mechanisms linking obesity with <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> {{dysfunction}} in obstructive {{sleep apnea}} are reviewed. Obstructive sleep apnea is due to alterations in <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> anatomy and neuromuscular control. <b>Upper</b> <b>airway</b> structural alterations in obesity are related to adipose deposition around the pharynx, which can increase its collapsibility or critical pressure (Pcrit). In addition, obesity and, particularly, central adiposity lead to reductions in resting lung volume, resulting in loss of caudal traction on <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> structures and parallel increases in pharyngeal collapsibility. Metabolic and humoral factors that promote central adiposity may contribute to these alterations in <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> mechanical function and increase sleep apnea susceptibility. In contrast, neural responses to <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> obstruction can mitigate these mechanical loads and restore pharyngeal patency during sleep.

40|$|A patent <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> is {{essential}} for survival. Increased age, obesity and some <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> anatomical features are associated with failure to maintain <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> patency during sleep, leading to obstructive sleep apnoea. However, many healthy subjects with these risk factors do not develop this condition. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine how anatomical factors and active dilator muscle contraction contribute to <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> patency in healthy volunteers across a broad range of age and body mass index (BMI). A 'tagged' magnetic resonance imaging technique quantified respiratory-related motion of the anterior and lateral walls of the <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> during quiet breathing in the supine position. Fifty-two subjects aged 22 − 68 years with BMI from 17. 5 to 40. 1 kg m⁻² were studied. Higher BMI was associated with smaller airway cross-sectional area at the level of soft palate (P < 0. 05). The genioglossus moved anteriorly to dilate the <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> during inspiration. This movement increased with increasing BMI, increasing age, a smaller airway area, and steeper tongue-base angle (all P < 0. 05). Motion of the lateral <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> at the soft-palate level was variable and less strongly linked to anatomical features of the <b>upper</b> <b>airway.</b> Multiple regression indicated that anterior genioglossus motion decreased with increasing airway area (P = 0. 03) and with increasing tongue-base angle (P = 0. 02).

50|$|During a total laryngectomy, {{the entire}} voicebox (larynx) is removed, {{which leads to}} a {{permanent}} disconnection of the upper and lower airways and a permanent tracheostoma (a breathing hole in the neck). Prior to the operation, breathing primarily occurs through the nasal airways. In the <b>upper</b> <b>airways,</b> the inhaled air is warmed up or cooled down, to prepare the optimal temperature before the air reaches the lungs. After a total laryngectomy, the <b>upper</b> <b>airways</b> are bypassed and breathing in and out occurs through the tracheostoma in the neck which means that the inhaled air flows directly into the lungs. These anatomical changes lead, among others, to changes in voice production, breathing, and olfaction. The nasal functions of regulating the temperature, humidifying, and filtering of the inhaled air are lost. The lack of these functions impairs the lower airways and the activity of the cilia, which leads to pulmonary problems such as tracheobronchial mucus, excessive sputum production, crusting, which can also cause fatigue and shortness of breath. To at least partially reduce these restrictions and compensate the nasal functions, an HME cassette can be attached over the tracheostoma to provide a means for conditioning, humidifying and to a certain extent filtering the inhaled air.|$|E

Obstructive sleep apnea and partial <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> obstruction during sleep were measured with the static charge-sensitive bed (SCSB) and pulse oximeter. The patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome were treated with tracheostomy. Palatal surgery was performed only if the <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> narrowing occurred exclusively at the soft palate level in patients with partial <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> obstruction during sleep. The ultrasound scalpel technique was compared to laser-assisted UPPP. The efficacy of LUPP to reduce partial <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> obstruction during sleep was assessed and histology of uvulopalatal specimen was compared to body fat distributional parameters and sleep study findings. Tracheostomy was effective therapy in severe obstructive sleep apnea. Partial <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> obstruction and arterial oxyhemoglobin desaturation index during sleep decreased significantly after LUPP. The minimal retropalatal airway dimension increased and soft palate collapsibility decreased at the level where the velopharyngeal obstruction had occurred before the surgery. Ultrasound scalpel did not offer any significant benefits over the laser-assisted technique, except fewer postoperative haemorrhage events. The loose connective tissue {{as a manifestation of}} edema was the only histological finding showing correlation with partial <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> obstruction parameters of SCSB. Tracheostomy remains a life-saving therapy and also long-term option when adherence to CPAP fails in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. LUPP effectively reduces partial <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> obstruction during sleep provided that obstruction at the other levels than the soft palate and uvula were preoperatively excluded. Technically the ultrasound scalpel or laser surgeries are equal. In patients with partial <b>upper</b> <b>airway</b> obstruction the loose connective tissue is more important than fat accumulation in the soft palate.
