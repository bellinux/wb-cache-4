When the EH-indirect or EH-direct formulations of the CMM are combined with the classical Mode Matching Method (MMM) a hybrid technique is obtained that is capable of solving three dimensional (3 D) discontinuities without restriction in number.

We consider a two-dimensional problem for which wave propagation is described by the scalar Helmholtz equation. The main difficulty in the modeling of the scattering problem lies in the choice of conditions which characterize the outgoing behavior of a scattered wave. We use here modal radiation conditions which extend the classical conditions used for closed waveguides. They are based on the generalized Fourier transforms which diagonalize the transverse contributions of the Helmholtz operator {{on both sides of the}} junction. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution, which seems to be the first result in this context.

These polymer optical components have localized gradient index structures, which are self-developed in diffusive photopolymers by introducing localized illuminations. Based on {{the sizes of}} the formed index structures, the photopolymer optics studied in this thesis fall into two categories: GRIN lens based optics and waveguide based optics. GRIN lenses and lens arrays with parabolic index profiles are created through Gaussian beam exposure, while GRIN lenses with arbitrary index profiles are created through a dual-axis galvo scanning system. Waveguide based optics, which include <b>uniform</b> <b>waveguides,</b> waveguide tapers, waveguides through thin optics and 900 sharp waveguide bends, are fabricated through direct-write lithography. Several quantitative characterization methods for the fabricated polymer optics are described. The index profiles of the GRIN lens based optics are quantitatively measured by a modified scanning transmission phase microscope and a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor. Three-dimensional mode profile characterization of the polymer waveguides is carried out through a novel polymer sample preparation procedure and an active mode imaging system. A single mode performance is confirmed for the fabricated waveguides. A loss measurement for the waveguides is also accomplished. An index formation model is developed for a diffusive polymer developed by Dr. McLeod 2 ̆ 7 s group, which provides a fundamental guidance for fabricating custom-design index structures in the polymer.

We demonstrate the concept of Parity-Time (PT) -symmetry in coupled <b>uniform</b> <b>waveguides</b> with balanced and symmetric gain and loss and how this condition {{is associated with a}} second order EPD. We show that by introducing gain into naturally lossy structures provides for the conditions whereby exceptional points of non-Hermitian degeneracies can be manifested, such as in PT- symmetric structures. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that PT- symmetry, despite being the method often suggested for obtaining non-Hermitian degeneracies at optical frequencies, is not a necessary condition and indeed we show that EPD can be obtained with broken topological symmetry in uniform TLs. Operating near such special degeneracy conditions leads to potential performance enhancement in a variety of microwave and optical resonators, and devices such as distributed oscillators, including lasers, amplifiers, radiating arrays, pulse compressors, and Qswitching sensors.

We show that in an adiabatically tapered waveguide, the frequency conversion has a much broader bandwidth and the efficiency within the bandwidth is almost constant, which is favorable for short pulses. We demonstrate both analytically and numerically an "area law" for the frequency conversion, i. e. the product of bandwidth and efficiency is conserved as long as peak conversion efficiency does not saturate. The adiabatic structure shows higher saturation thresholds in pump power or interaction length, outperforming the conventional <b>uniform</b> <b>waveguide</b> design.
