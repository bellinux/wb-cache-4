Introducing dielectric loading makes it possible to tune antenna to operate over a frequency range not covered with <b>unloaded</b> <b>antenna,</b> while maintaining an omnidirectional radiation pattern. The simulations are performed when loading is done with lossy as well as lossless dielectric and the results are compared. The observational frequency range is extended up to 40 GHz.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{with the}} performance of different loaded (e. g. inverted L, T, I and C-shaped <b>antennas)</b> and <b>unloaded</b> wire <b>antennas</b> as electromagnetic interference (EMI) sensors. To determine electromagnetic radiation from an electronic component, it is required to evaluate the field strength at a certain distance from it using the sensor. The most common performance descriptor of a sensor is its antenna factor. Here, the method of moments with pulse basis function and point-matching technique has been used to evaluate the current distribution on the antenna surface, and hence, the antenna factor of different wire antennas. The same theory for <b>unloaded</b> <b>antennas</b> has been extended for different loaded-wire antennas. The loaded antennas in transmitting mode are widely used for low-frequency communication. However, while using these antennas as EMI sensors, the extra loading is likely to introduce the reception of cross-polarised component of incident electric field. This paper highlights the results of the initial investigation on the performance of these loaded antennas as EMI sensors in terms of the antenna factor for the desired and cross-polarised component of incident electric field...|$|R

The fidelity factor was calculated, with and without loading, using the simulated transmitted and received pulses in three points in the azimuth plane. Results show that this dielectric loading technique does not cause significant pulse distortion. The fidelity factor is affected only by an average of 2. 8 % relative to the <b>unloaded</b> <b>antennas</b> in all situations considered. Two versions of the same antenna design were studied: coplanar- and microstrip-fed. It was found that the influence of feeding on the fidelity factor is also minimal.

40|$|A compact 2 × 2 metamaterial-MIMO antenna for WLAN {{applications}} {{is presented}} in this paper. The MIMO antenna is designed by placing side by side two single metamaterial antennas which are constructed based on the modified composite right/left-handed (CRLH) model. By adding another left-handed inductor, the total left-handed inductor of the modified CRLH model is increased remarkably in comparison with that of conventional CRLH model. As a result, the proposed metamaterial antenna achieves 60 % size reduction {{in comparison with the}} <b>unloaded</b> <b>antenna.</b> The MIMO antenna is electrically small (30 [*]mm × 44 [*]mm) with an edge-to-edge separation between two antennas of 0. 06 λ 0 at 2. 4 [*]GHz. In order to reduce the mutual coupling of the antenna, a defected ground structure (DGS) is inserted to suppress the effect of surface current between elements of the proposed antenna.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a {{new method}} is given for {{reducing}} the size and/or increasing the gain and bandwidth of Planar Inverted F Antenna (PIFA). Slow Wave Enhancement (SWE) factor is used inorder to achieve miniaturization. This paper investigates the feasibility of utilizing antenna with capacitive load to reduce the overall length. The antenna is being loaded with shunt capacitors {{to slow down the}} waves in the structures so as to achieve size reduction. Experimental results show that there is a size reduction of about thirty-two times from the unloaded counterpart of the antenna at the expense of degraded gains and bandwidth. The Planar Inverted F Antenna loaded with capacitors shows a gain and bandwidth of 5. 125 dB and 90 MHz at the operating frequency. Inorder to increase the gain and bandwidth further, a matching circuit designed from filter design techniques is used. The Planar Inverted F Antenna combined with the filter type impedance matching circuit produced a gain and bandwidth of 6. 362 dB and 548. 8 MHz at the operating frequency. The <b>unloaded</b> <b>antenna</b> shows an efficiency of 98. 5 % while the capacitively loaded antenna has an efficiency of 94. 9 %.

40|$|Abstract—A simple {{theory is}} {{presented}} to predict the lumped reactance loading for circularly polarized circular loop antennas with a uniform traveling-wave current distribution. The reactive load is located on a circular wire loop of one-wavelength circumference at a position of 45 away from the feed point. To achieve a uniform traveling-wave current distribution, the loading reactance and the input impedances of the loaded and <b>unloaded</b> loop <b>antennas</b> need to satisfy certain conditions. First, the input resistance and the input reactance of the <b>unloaded</b> loop <b>antenna</b> {{should have the same}} absolute value. Second, the input impedance of the loaded loop must be purely resistive and its value needs to be two times of the input resistance of the unloaded loop. Third, the loading reactance should be chosen to be two times in value and opposite in sense of the input reactance of the unloaded loop. These conditions can be approximately met when the circular loop is placed above a ground plane. The loading reactance is determined from the input impedance of the unloaded loop and is optimized for an optimal performance of circular polarization. It is found that the reactive load must be capacitive and its value depends on the height of the loop above the ground plane and the thickness of the wire. The characteristics of the circular polarization and the input impedance of the capacitance-loaded circular loop antennas are investigated. An experimental example {{is presented to}} verify the theoretical prediction.

40|$|The {{integral}} equation and moment method solution is developed for two different antennas {{in the presence}} of an infinite grounded dielectric substrate. The first antenna is a rectangular microstrip patch antenna. This antenna is analyzed for excitation by an incident plane wave in free space and a vertical filament of uniform current in the dielectric.

The radar cross section of the microstrip antenna is found from the plane wave excitation and shows good agreement to measurement for both an <b>unloaded</b> and loaded <b>antenna.</b> The input impedance is found from the current filament excitation. This is compared to the measured input impedance of a coaxially fed microstrip antenna and shows good agreement for both <b>unloaded</b> and loaded <b>antennas</b> when the dielectric substrate is much less than a wavelength.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} the radiation Q and the volume enclosed by a certain strength of near electric field, by using the dielectric loaded monopole antennas (DLMAs) which have center monopole antennas with 1. 3 mm diameter and 6 mm height. The dielectric loading material is cylindrical and has 9. 6 mm diameter and 6 mm height. The relative permittivity (Er) values are from 1. 00 (an <b>unloaded</b> monopole <b>antenna)</b> to 12. 0. The volume enclosed by near electric fields is obtained only by the FDTD calculation, where the FDTD simulator Fidelity Ver. 2. 16 (Zeland Co.) is used. We picked up two values of electric field strength (40 V/m and 50 V/m) as measueres for the volume. As a result, we found that dependence of the normalized radiation Q of the DLMAs on the Er value has a minimum point at the Er value of about 3 - 4. The normalized radiation Q is a radiation Q normalized by that of the unloaded monopole. Also, we confirmed that the dependence of the normalized radiator Q on the Er value of the DLMAs showed a similar tendency to the dependence of the volume enclosed by a certain strength of near electric field on the Er value...|$|R

40|$|A compact, fully-printed negative-refractive-index transmission-line (NRI-TL) metamaterial-loaded {{dipole antenna}} is proposed, which {{exhibits}} multiband resonant characteristics {{that are not}} harmonically related. The multiband behavior is achieved by loading a host dipole antenna with series capacitive gaps and shunt inductive strips, to form a two unit-cell NRI-TL loaded antenna. By modeling the right-handed dipole sections as biconical transmission lines, the rich dispersion properties of the NRI-TL structure can be exploited, while still creating an effective radiator. An equivalent circuit model of the NRI-TL antenna is developed, and it is shown that its performance agrees well with the results obtained using full-wave simulations. It is also shown that the resonant behavior of the antenna can be adjusted by changing its geometrical parameters, which in turn tune the loading parameters of each NRI-TL unit cell. As such, both dual-band and triband versions of the antenna are designed and fabricated. The dual-band version exhibits three distinct resonances at 1. 15, 2. 88, and 3. 72 GHz, with measured- 10 dB bandwidths of 37 and 1150 MHz. The lowest resonance at 1. 15 GHz corresponds to a 47 % reduction in the resonant frequency {{compared to that of}} a reference <b>unloaded</b> dipole <b>antenna,</b> which translates into a size miniaturization factor of approximately two.
