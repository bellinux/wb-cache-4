40|$|An energy-based swing {{hammer mill}} {{model has been}} {{developed}} for coke oven feed preparation. it comprises a mechanistic power model to determine the dynamic internal recirculation and a perfect mixing mill model with a dual-classification function to mimic the operations of crusher and screen. The model parameters were calibrated using a pilot-scale swing hammer mill at various operating conditions. The effects of the <b>underscreen</b> configurations and the feed sizes on hammer mill operations were demonstrated through the fitted model parameters. Relationships between the model parameters and the machine configurations were established. The model was validated using the independent experimental data of single lithotype coal tests with the same BJD pilot-scale hammer mill and full operation audit data of an industrial hammer mill. The outcome of the energy-based swing hammer mill model is the capability to simulate the impact of changing blends of coal or mill configurations and operating conditions on product size distribution. Alternatively, the model {{can be used to}} select the machine settings required to achieve a desired product. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{breakage}} {{characteristics of}} low rank coals {{were tested in}} a laboratory using ECO coal from an Indonesian mine as the feed material. The grinding test results were used to fit {{the parameters of the}} breakage functions of an existing continuous hammer mill model. The mill hold-up, specific energy and projection rate to the screen were analyzed to observe the effects of operating conditions. The results indicate that for each <b>underscreen</b> aperture there exists a characteristic threshold point of the feed rate above which over-grinding occurs. This threshold point can be used to determine the optimal operating conditions of the breakage process. Additionally, a scale-up model of the hammer mill is established based on the energy-size relationship to predict the mill capacity {{as a function of the}} mill design and the operating parameters. A comparison between the prediction from the model and the manufacturer's data illustrates that the model based on Rittinger's theory fits the breakage characteristics of the hammer mill better than the models based on Bond's and Kick's theories. The established scale-up model agrees well with the manufacturer's test data within an acceptable degree of accuracy...|$|E
40|$|We study a {{generalization}} of the Kondo {{model in which}} the impurity spin is represented by Abrikosov fermions in a rotation group SU(P) larger than the SU(N) group associated to the spin of the conduction electrons, thereby forcing the single electronic bath to <b>underscreen</b> the localized moment. We demonstrate how to formulate a controlled large N limit preserving the property of underscreening, and which {{can be seen as}} a "dual" theory of the multichannel large N equations usually associated to overscreening. Due to the anomalous scattering on the uncompensated degrees of freedom, the Fermi liquid description of the electronic fluid is invalidated, with the logarithmic singularities known to occur in the S= 1 SU(2) Kondo impurity model being replaced by continuous power laws at N=∞. The present technique can be extended to tackle the related underscreened Kondo lattice model in the large N limit. We discover the occurence of an insulating pseudogap regime in place of the expected renormalized metallic phase of the fully screened case, preventing the establishement of coherence over the lattice. This work and the recent observation of a similar weakly insulating behavior on transport in CeCuAs_ 2 should give momentum for further studies of underscreened impurity models on the lattice.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} recently by Gan, Coleman, and Andrei that studying the <b>underscreened</b> Kondo problem may help {{to understand the nature}} of magnetism in heavy fermion systems.

The <b>underscreened</b> Kondo necklace is the simplest lattice model on which the competition between Kondo spin compensation, and magnetic ordering due to an RKKY–type interaction can be examined. We used the mean–field approximation to determine the phase diagram, and found that the lowtemperature phase is always an x − y antiferromagnet. This contention is further supported by the derivation of the exact form of the effective hamiltonian in the limit of very large Kondo coupling: it is found to be an antiferromagnetic x −y model for the residual S − 1 / 2 spins.

We sought to gather the perceptions of clinic personnel at Latino-serving Federally Qualified Health Centers (operating 17 clinics) about barriers to utilization of screening services for colorectal cancer. MethodWe conducted one-on-one interviews among 17 clinic personnel at four Latino-serving Federally Qualified Health Center networks in Oregon.

40|$|We {{study the}} role of strong {{electron}} confinement in surface-enhanced Raman scattering from molecules adsorbed on small noble-metal particles. We describe {{a new source of}} Raman signal enhancement which originates from different behavior of sp-band and d-band electron densities near the particle boundary. In small particles, a spillover of sp-electron wave-functions beyond the classical radius gives rise to a thin layer with diminished population of d-electrons. In this surface layer, the screening of sp-electrons by d-band electron background is reduced. We demonstrate that the interplay between finite-size and <b>underscreening</b> effects results in an increase of the surface plasmon local field acting on a molecule located in a close proximity to the particle boundary. Our calculations, based on two-region model, show that the additional enhancement of Raman signal gets stronger for smaller nanoparticles due to a larger volume fraction of <b>underscreened</b> region.

For large values of J_K, we obtain a ferromagnetically ordered solution and a Kondo regime with a Kondo temperature, T_K, larger than the Curie temperature, T_C. This finding suggests a scenario for a coexistence of Kondo effect and ferromagnetic order. In some uranium compounds, like UTe or UCu_ 0. 9 Sb_ 2, this kind of coexistence has been experimentally observed: they order ferromagnetically with a Curie temperature of order T_C ∼ 100 K and exhibit a Kondo behavior for T > T_C.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{extensive}} {{study of the}} two-impurity Kondo problem for spin- 1 adatoms on square lattice using an exact canonical transformation to map the problem onto an effective one-dimensional system that can be numerically solved using the density matrix renormalization group method. We provide a simple intuitive picture and identify the different regimes, depending on {{the distance between the}} two impurities, Kondo coupling $J_K$, longitudinal anisotropy $D$, and transverse anisotropy $E$. In the isotropic case, two impurities on opposite(same) sublattices have a singlet(triplet) ground state. However, the energy difference between the triplet ground state and the singlet excited state is very small and we expect an effectively four-fold degenerate ground state, i. e., two decoupled impurities. For large enough $J_K$ the impurities are practically uncorrelated forming two independent <b>underscreened</b> states with the conduction electrons, a clear non-perturbative effect. When the impurities are entangled in an RKKY-like state, Kondo correlations persists and the two effects coexist: the impurities are <b>underscreened,</b> and the dangling spin-$ 1 / 2 $ degrees of freedom are responsible for the inter-impurity entanglement.

40|$|We {{extend the}} Schwinger boson large N {{treatment}} of the <b>underscreened</b> Kondo model {{in a way that}} correctly captures the finite elastic phase shift in the singular Fermi liquid. The new feature of the approach, is the introduction of a flavor quantum number with K possible values, associated with the Schwinger boson representation. The large N limit is taken maintaining the ratio k=K/N fixed. This approach differs from previous approaches, in that we do not explicitly enforce a constraint on the spin representation of the Schwinger bosons. Instead, the energetics of the Kondo model cause the bosonic degrees of freedom to ``self assemble'' into a ground-state in which the spins of K bosons and N-K conduction electrons are antisymmetrically arranged into a Kondo singlet. With this device, the large N limit can be taken, {{in such a way that}} a fraction K/N of the Abrikosov Suhl resonance is immersed inside the Fermi sea.

First, by using the second-order perturbation theory we show that the coupling to spin-polarized electrode results in an effective exchange field B_ eff and an effective magnetic anisotropy D_ eff. Second, we confirm these findings by using the numerical renormalization group method, which is employed to study the dependence of the quantum dot spectral functions, as well as quantum dot spin, on various parameters of the system. We show that the <b>underscreened</b> Kondo effect is generally suppressed due to the presence of effective exchange field and can be restored by tuning the anisotropy constant, when |D_ eff| = |B_ eff|. The Kondo effect can also be restored by sweeping an external magnetic field, and the restoration occurs twice in a single sweep. From the distance between the restored Kondo resonances one can extract the information about both the exchange field and the effective anisotropy. Finally, we calculate the temperature dependence of linear conductance for the parameters where the Kondo effect is restored and show that the restored Kondo resonances display a universal scaling of S= 1 / 2 Kondo effect.

40|$|We {{show that}} {{thermodynamics}} {{is insufficient to}} probe {{the nature of the}} low energy dynamics of quantum impurity models and a more subtle analysis based on scattering theory is required. Traditionally, quantum impurity models are classified into one of two categories: Fermi liquids and non-Fermi liquids, depending on the analytic properties of the various thermodynamic quntities. We show, however, that even when a quantum impurity model is a Fermi liquid (an incoming electron at the Fermi level scatters elastically off the impurity), one may find singular thermodynamic behavior if characteristics of quasiparticles are not analytic near the Fermi surface. Prompted by this observation, we divide Fermi liquids into two categories: regular Fermi liquids and singular Fermi Liquids. The difference between regular Fermi liquids, singular Fermi liquids, and non-Fermi liquids fixed points is explained using properties of the many-body S-matrix for impurity quasiparticle scattering. Using the Bethe-Ansatz and numerical RG, we show that whereas the ordinary Kondo Model is a regular Fermi liquid the <b>underscreened</b> Kondo model is a a singular Fermi liquid. This results in a breakdown of Nozieres' Fermi liquid picture for the <b>underscreened</b> and explains the singular thermodynamic behavior noticed in Bethe Ansatz and large-N calculations. Furthermore, we show that conventional regular Fermi liquid behavior is re-established in an external magnetic field H, but with a density of states which diverges as 1 /H.

We evaluated how vaccine uptake distribution affects inequalities in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) incidence between groups with different screen-ing participation. Methods:We used an individual-based transmission dynam-ic model of HPV infection and disease (HPV-ADVISE). Females were stratified by routine screening frequency. We modeled the impact of vaccination on SCC incidence rate differences (absolute inequality) and incidence rate ratios (relative inequality) between women who have routine screen-ing intervals of < 5 years (frequently screened), 5 years (<b>underscreened),</b> and who are never screened. We compared simulations with uniform vaccine uptake with scenarios with unequal vaccine uptake, in which never and <b>underscreened</b> women have lower vaccine uptake than frequently screened women. Results: Absolute SCC inequalities between groups with dif-ferent screening rates were predicted to decrease after vaccination, evenwhenwomenwith the lowest screeningparticipationhad the lowest vaccine uptake. Herd effects helped reduce absolute inequalities when vaccine uptake was unequal. Conversely, rel-ative SCC inequalities remained unchanged or increased after vaccination. Results were robust to different overall vaccination coverages and sexual mixing scenarios. Conclusion: Though mass HPV vaccination is predicted to substantially decrease SCC incidence rates, never screenedwomen will still have the highest disease burden after vaccination. Impact: To reduce both absolute and relative SCC inequalities, public health initiatives will need to address inequalities in both vaccine uptake and in cervical cancer screening participation.

40|$|International audienceWe review here some {{universal}} {{aspects of}} the physics of two-electron molecular transistors {{in the absence of}} strong spin-orbit effects. Several recent quantum dot experiments have shown that an electrostatic backgate could be used to control the energy dispersion of magnetic levels. We discuss how the generally asymmetric coupling of the metallic contacts to two different molecular orbitals can indeed lead to a gate-tunable Hund's rule in the presence of singlet and triplet states in the quantum dot. For gate voltages such that the singlet constitutes the (non-magnetic) ground state, one generally observes a suppression of low voltage transport, which can yet be restored in the form of enhanced cotunneling features at finite bias. More interestingly, when the gate voltage is controlled to obtain the triplet configuration, spin S = 1 Kondo anomalies appear at zero bias, with non-Fermi liquid features related to the <b>underscreening</b> of a spin larger than 1 / 2. Finally, the small bare singlet-triplet splitting in our device allows fine-tuning with the gate between these two magnetic configurations, leading to an unscreening quantum phase transition. This transition occurs between the non-magnetic singlet phase, where a two-stage Kondo effect occurs, and the triplet phase, where the partially compensated (<b>underscreened)</b> moment is akin to a magnetically 'ordered' state. These observations are put theoretically into a consistent global picture by using new numerical renormalization group simulations, tailored to capture sharp finite-voltage cotunneling features within the Coulomb diamonds, together with complementary out-of-equilibrium diagrammatic calculations on the two-orbital Anderson model.
