5|$|The torrential {{rainfall}} in Florida flooded about 93,000homes, affecting 214,000residents in Miami-Dade County. An incomplete damage {{survey of}} Miami-Dade County indicated the flooding destroyed 1,005houses, severely damaged 1,358, and caused minor damage to 3,443. The flood waters, which were fourft (1.2m) deep in places, stranded many in their houses, {{forcing them to}} use canoes or inflatable rafts to move to higher grounds. All schools in the Miami area were closed, and all non-essential Miami-Dade County employees were asked to stay home. Numerous flights in Miami International Airport were canceled or delayed, although the airport remained opened. The flooding, which was greatest in Sweetwater, West Miami, Hialeah, Opa-locka, and Pembroke Park, lasted {{up to a week}} in areas. The extreme flooding damaged electrical stations, leaving more than 27,000 without power. The flooding indirectly killed three people, two from drowning as a result of driving vehicles into deep water, and one when a man fell from a tall building while trying to <b>unclog</b> a roof drain. Property damage totaled $450million.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of May 31, in a {{farmhouse}} on a hill just above the South Fork Dam, Elias Unger, president of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, awoke {{to the sight of}} Lake Conemaugh swollen after a night-long heavy rainfall. Unger ran outside in the still-pouring rain to assess the situation and saw that the water was nearly cresting the dam. He quickly assembled a group of men to save the face of the dam by trying to <b>unclog</b> the spillway; it was blocked by the broken fish trap and debris caused by the swollen waterline. Other men tried digging a ditch {{at the other end of}} the dam, on the western abutment which was lower than the dam crest. The idea was to let more water out of the lake to try to prevent overtopping of the crest, but without success. Most remained on top of the dam, some plowing earth to raise it, while others tried to pile mud and rock on the face to save the eroding wall.|$|E

40|$|Gravity driven flows {{such as in}} hoppers and silos are {{susceptible}} to clogging due {{to the formation of}} arches at the exit whose failure is the key to re-initiation of flow. In vibrated hoppers, clog durations exhibit a broad distribution, which poses a challenge for devising efficient <b>unclogging</b> protocols.

Treating arch failure as a first passage process of this random walk, we argue that the distribution of <b>unclogging</b> times is determined by this waiting time distribution. We hypothesize that this is a generic feature of <b>unclogging,</b> and that specific characteristics, such as hopper geometry, and mechanical properties of the grains modify the waiting time distribution.

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{experimentally}} quantify {{the influence of}} a reduction of surface sediment permeability on microbial characteristics and ecological processes (respiration and leaf litter decomposition) occurring in the hyporheic zone (i. e. the sedimentary interface between surface water and groundwater). The physical structure of the water-sediment interface was manipulated by adding a 2 -cm layer of coarse sand (<b>unclogged</b> systems) or fine sand (clogged systems) at the sediment surface of slow filtration columns filled with a heterogeneous gravel/sand sedimentary matrix. The influence of clogging was quantified through measurements of hydraulic conductivity, water chemistry, microbial abundances and activities and associated processes (decomposition of alder leaf litter inserted at a depth of 9 cm in sediments, oxygen and nitrate consumption by microorganisms). Fine sand deposits drastically reduced hydraulic conductivity (by around 8 -fold in comparison with <b>unclogged</b> systems topped by coarse sand) and associated water flow, leading to a sharp decrease in oxygen (reaching less than 1 mg L(- 1) at 3 cm depth) and nitrate concentrations with depth in sediments. The shift from aerobic to anaerobic conditions in clogged systems favoured the establishment of denitrifying bacteria living on sediments. Analyses performed on buried leaf litter showed a reduction by 30 % of organic matter decomposition in clogged systems in comparison with <b>unclogged</b> systems. This reduction was linked to a negative influence of clogging on the activities and abundances of leaf-associated microorganisms. Finally, our study clearly demonstrated that microbial processes involved in organic matter decomposition were dependent on hydraulic conductivity and oxygen availability in the hyporheic zone...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{detecting}} and separating CTCs {{can play a}} key role in early cancer detection and treatment. In recent years, there has been growing interest in using deformability-based CTC separation microfilters due to their simplicity and low cost. Most of previous studies in this area are mainly based on experimental work. Although experimental research provides useful insights in designing CTC separation devices, there is still a lack of design guidelines based on fundamental understandings of the cell separation process in the filers. While experimental efforts face challenges especially microfabrication difficulties, we adopt numerical simulation here to study conical-shaped microfilters using deformability difference between CTCs and blood cells for separation process. We use liquid drop model for modeling a CTC passing through such microfilters. The accuracy of the model in predicting the pressure signature of the system is validated by comparing with previous experiments. Pressure-deformability analysis of the cell going through the channel is then carried out in detail in order to better understand how a CTC behaves throughout the filtration process. Different system design criteria such as system throughput and <b>unclogging</b> of the system are discussed. Specifically, pressure behavior under different system throughput is analyzed. Regarding the <b>unclogging</b> issue, we define pressure ratio as a key parameter representing the ability to overcome clogging in such CTC separation devices and investigate the effect of conical angle on the optimum pressure ratio. Finally, the effect of <b>unclogging</b> applied pressure on the system performance is examined. Our study provides detailed understandings of the cell separation process and its characteristics, which can be used for developing more efficient CTC separation devices...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{study of}} the {{clogging}} of two soils, a sand with grains ranging from 0. 4 to 4 mm, and a gravel with grains ranging from 1 to 10 mm, {{was carried out by}} feeding the bacteria initially present in the soils. The focus of this research is to study the durability of bioclogging. The results showed that clogging occurred quickly after the injection of nutrients. The soils were subjected to gradient increases and a critical hydraulic gradient i(crit) (corresponding to the gradient for which <b>unclogging</b> occurred and an increase in the flow of water was observed) was determined. It is equal to 0. 8 for the sand and to 0. 06 for the gravel. The durability of bioclogged soils was also studied by performing 10 to 30 hydraulic gradient cycles between the initial value and i(crit) / 2. For the sand, the permeability increase after the cycles was very low. In contrast, in the gravel, <b>unclogging</b> occurred very quickly, highlighting the influence of grain size and materials grading. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the content of colloids in septic tank effluent and their impact on textile filter permeability. Measurements were performed on septic tank effluent without suspended solids but containing colloids and without colloids - including only dissolved substances (filtered by micro-filters and centrifuged). The study was conducted on <b>unclogged</b> and clogged textile filter coupons. During the study the following measurements were determined: turbidity, chemical oxygen demand and hydraulic conductivity of textile filter coupons. The colloid size range was assumed to be less than 1. 2 microns according to the literature. Despite the relatively low content in the septic tank effluent the colloids played an important role in the clogging process. Both the filtering media, filled with low (<b>unclogged)</b> and high content of biomass (clogged) were sensitive to the clogging process of colloid acceleration due to the possibility of small diameter pore closure and oxygen access termination. Moreover, small size pores were probably sensitive to closing or bridging by small size colloidal particles...|$|R
