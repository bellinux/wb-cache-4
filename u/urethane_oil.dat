40|$|AbstractPost-consumer PET bottles were depolymerized with {{propylene}} glycol at a weight ratio between PET and glycol of 37. 5 : 62. 5 under microwave energy at irradiation power of 600 watt, using zinc acetate as a catalyst. The glycolyzed product, consisting of oligomeric diols with a hydroxyl value of 253 mg KOH/g, was obtained. Analysis of the glycolyzed product by GPC {{indicated that it}} consists of compounds with a number-average molecular weight of 2265. The glycolyzed product was further reacted with linseed oil and toluene diisocyanate to obtain <b>urethane</b> <b>oil</b> at hydroxyl to isocyanate ratio of 1 : 0. 8 with methanol acting as a blocking agent. It {{was found that the}} obtained <b>urethane</b> <b>oil</b> was a transparent yellowish liquid with low viscosity. The prepared <b>urethane</b> <b>oil</b> was characterized for molecular weight and its properties were determined and compared with those of the conventional and commercial urethane oils. Results showed that the properties of waste PET bottles-based <b>urethane</b> <b>oil</b> were comparable to those of the commercial <b>urethane</b> <b>oil...</b>|$|E
30|$|Chemically {{recycled}} PET can be {{used for}} applications in the manufacture of polyurethane (Lee et al. 1994, 1995; Vaidya and Nadkarni 1990) and unsaturated polyester resin (Abdel-Azim et al. 1994; Lu and Kim 2001; Suh et al. 2000). Polyurethane is a widely used polymer for various applications such as insulation, seating materials, and artificial leather (Park et al. 2013). The oligoesters obtained from PET glycolysis can be further reacted with aliphatic diacids to form polyester polyols, which can be utilized as the starting material for polyurethane synthesis (Nikles and Farahat 2005). The PET oligoesters can be directly reacted with diisocyanate for preparation of polyurethane (Ikladious 2000; Chen et al. 2001 b; Pardal and Tersac 2007; Kosmidis et al. 2001). Mercit (Mercit and Akar 2001) reported on the synthesis of new <b>urethane</b> <b>oil</b> from glycolysis-treated PET waste. The glycolysis of PET using different diol compounds produces different glycolysis products, leading to a broad spectrum of physical properties of the polyurethane obtained from these products.|$|E
30|$|Before their uses as architectural, {{domestic}} and automotive paints, the main applications of PU coatings were clear wood varnishes, leather finishes, maintenance and protective paints. Starting from 1952, {{most of the}} early PU coatings were made of polyester-polyisocyanate polymers. In the 1960 s, the gradual decrease of costs for diisocyanates and other chemical precursors contributed to the market expansion of the PU coatings [14]. At this time, in the US, <b>urethane</b> <b>oils,</b> obtained by reacting diisocyanates with drying oils or their derivatives, were the most widespread type of PU coatings.|$|R
5000|$|In 2013, Wise began a {{collection}} of sculptures featuring different kinds of bread adorned with designer labels modeled after various It bags. The sculptures were made out of <b>urethane</b> and <b>oil</b> paint and finished with a designer label or charm along with straps {{to make it look}} like a functional bag or purse. The collection began with a play on the Louis Vuitton [...] "baguettes," [...] in which Wise created a bread mold of a baguette out of urethane and then painted it with oil paints to resemble a real loaf of bread. She then drilled into the sculpture to add straps and a Louis Vuitton charm. The collection also includes a Prada backpack made of a sculpted, braided challah loaf titled [...] "Ainâ€™t No Challah Back Girl," [...] and another piece with a sculpted bagel with cream cheese completed with a Chanel chain and charm called [...] "Bagel No. 5." ...|$|R
40|$|CHIECO-BIANCHI et al. (1963) {{reported}} that Swiss mice receiving urethane as a subcutaneous injection at birth (1 mg. /g. body weight) followed by twice weekly applications of croton oil, starting at forty days, developed skin papillomas. The tumour incidence was {{significantly greater than}} that in mice given <b>urethane</b> or croton <b>oil</b> only, and that in mice given an equivalent dose (on a body weight basis) of urethane at forty days and similar treatment with croton oil. Graffi, Scharsach and Heyer (1955) found that doses of 400 - 1200,ug. 9, 10 dimethyl- 1, 2 -benzanthracene (DMBA) effectively initiated the induction of skin tumours when given orally, intravenously, or intraperitoneally to adult mice. Croton oil, applied to the skin, was the promoter. Small doses of DMBA induce malignant lymphomas, lung adenomas and {{a wide variety of}} other tumours whe...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{foundries}} increasingly use chemically-bonded no-bake sand cores and molds {{because they}} provide ease of molding, good surface finish, and collapsibility. One {{of the most popular}} binder systems is <b>oil</b> <b>urethane</b> no-bake comprising three parts: alkyd resin, catalyst, and crosslinking agent. Their amounts and ratios can influence mold shrinkage, and thereby dimensional quality of the resulting casting. With rising emphasis on net-shape casting, {{there is a need to}} optimize the binder composition to minimize the dimensional errors, while achieving the desired bench life, stripping time and hardness. This work investigates the effect of binder composition on the dimensions of chemically-bonded sand cores (25 mm diameter and 100 mm length) with respect to time. The maximum shrinkage of 0. 15 % over length was observed when resin content was 2. 4 % by weight of sand. The rate of shrinkage was higher with increase in the amount of catalyst. Core hardness and reduction in weight were also measured followed by SEM studies to gain a better understanding of the underlying phenomena, including formation of resin bridges between compacted sand particles and evaporation of solvent. This work is expected to aid in selection of the most appropriate binder composition for a given set of molding process constraints and cast product requirements...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the literature indicates that changes occurring in the calibre of the bronchi during the normal respiratory movements have never been demonstrated. In {{a review of the}} subject by von Skramlik (1925) it is remarked that one would anticipate a widening during inspiration, a narrowing during expiration, but that in quiet respiration these differences are obviously too small to record. In forced respiratory movements as in cough it is known (Briinings, 1912) that a narrowing in the bronchi occurs just at the instant that the vocal chords are forced apart. METHODS Within the past few years lipiodol has permitted the outlining of the bronchial tree in the living subject with great accuracy and detail (Forestier, 1926). It was therefore decided to investigate the possibility of using this substance to demonstrate any changes {{in the size of the}} bronchi which might occur during normal respiration. For the observations on living subjects, one cat, two dogs, and five human subjects were employed. The animals were anesthetized with <b>urethane</b> and the <b>oil</b> administered by tracheal puncture. In man the films were taken in the course of diagnostic procedures. No anesthetic was required, the technique described by Singer (1926) being employed. After injection of the oil, x-ray films were taken in man during the actual process of breathing and also while holding the breath at the end of inspiration and at the end of expiration...|$|R
