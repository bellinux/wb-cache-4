50|$|The {{atmosphere}} within waveguide assemblies {{is often}} pressurized, either {{to prevent the}} ingress of moisture, or to raise the breakdown voltage in the guide and hence increase the power that it can carry. Pressurization requires that all joints in the waveguide be airtight. This is usually achieved {{by means of a}} rubber O-ring seated in a groove in the face of at least one of flanges forming each join. Gasket, gasket/cover or pressurizable flanges (such as that on the right of figure 2), are identifiable by the single circular groove which accommodates the O-ring. It is only necessary for one of the flanges in each pressurizable connection to be of this type; the other may have a plain flat face (like that in figure 1). This ungrooved type is known as a cover, plain or <b>unpressurizable</b> <b>flange.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is also {{possible}} to form air-tight seal between a pair of otherwise <b>unpressurizable</b> <b>flanges</b> using a flat gasket made out of a special electrically conductive elastomer. Two plain cover flanges may be mated without such a gasket, but the connection is then not pressurizable.|$|R
50|$|It is {{considered}} wrong to join together two choke flanges; the resulting {{gap between the}} flange faces is twice that intended, and the effect {{is similar to that}} of having two joins in the guide rather than one. In the absence of <b>unpressurizable</b> choke <b>flanges,</b> all flanges fall into one of three categories: choke, gasket/cover and cover. An E-plane cross section of an assembled choke connection is shown in figure 3. This is the plane cutting each of the broad walls of the waveguide along its centre-line, which is where the longitudinal surface currents—those that must cross the join—are at their strongest. The choke ditch and the gap between the flange faces together form a somewhat convoluted side-branch to the path of the main guide. This side branch is designed to present a low input impedance where it meets the broad walls of the waveguide, so that the surface currents there are not obstructed by the gap, but instead flow onto and off of the separated faces of the flanges. Conversely, on the outer edge of the choke ditch, at the point where the two flanges come into physical contact, the ditch presents a high series impedance. The current through the contact point is thus reduced to a small value, and the danger of arcing across any crack between the flanges is likewise reduced.|$|R
