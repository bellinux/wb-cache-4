50|$|The USS {{standard}} {{is no longer}} supported. It, together with the SAE fastener standard, was incorporated into the <b>Unified</b> <b>Thread</b> Standard. However, the term, USS, continues to be used occasionally today to describe inch based threaded fasteners with a coarse thread pitch and inch based washers that {{are a little bit}} larger than the corresponding SAE washer. The <b>Unified</b> <b>Thread</b> Standard uses the term UNC (Unified National Coarse) to describe a fastener that previously would have been designated USS and the <b>Unified</b> <b>Thread</b> Standard uses the term UNF (Unified National Fine) to describe a fastener that would have previously been designated SAE.|$|E

50|$|Latin American music {{comes in}} many varieties, from the simple, rural conjunto music of {{northern}} Mexico to the sophisticated habanera of Cuba, from the symphonies of Heitor Villa-Lobos {{to the simple}} and moving Andean flute.
