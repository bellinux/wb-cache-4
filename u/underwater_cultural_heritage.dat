The Mediterranean could be considered a primary heritage and concern for the bordering States (and for the EU as well). The regime governing this kind of seas could be oriented towards the protection of the marine environment, the sound management of living resources, the preservation of the common <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage.</b> It would be interesting to evaluate whether the idea of "prime responsibility" (applied in the case of Antarctica) may present some purpose also in the Mediterranean...|$|R

Reports in September indicated that crane-equipped barges had stripped off most of the wreck's superstructure, forward turrets, and forward decking, and that explosives {{have been used to}} break the ship up for easier recovery. These actions have compromised the structural integrity of the wreck site, and have potentially exposed live munitions and oil tanks. Perths wreck is not protected as a war grave, either through the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the <b>Underwater</b> <b>Cultural</b> <b>Heritage</b> (Australia and Indonesia are not signatories to the treaty) or through legislation in either nation. The stripping of Perths wreck was not publicly reported until December 2013; the Australian Broadcasting Corporation speculated that the government departments made aware of the issue tried to keep it under wraps to avoid further deteriorating relations between Australia and Indonesia, particularly following the Australia–Indonesia spying scandal.|$|E

The donor countries investigated are Japan, Germany, Sweden and Norway. The purpose of the thesis is to describe and discuss the discourse of <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> aid and scrutinize how the donors define the concept 'cultural heritage', their motives for giving aid to <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage,</b> and if the countries deal with aspects of power in their <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> policies. The investigation is done with the methodology of discourse analysis through text analyses. The sources constitute of <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> theory literature, foreign aid theory literature and policy papers, guidelines and other documents from donor countries concerning their <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> aid. The thesis is disposed in one theoretical part and one empirical part. In the theoretical part, the <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> sector’s definition of <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage,</b> usual motives within foreign aid and different views of the ownership of <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> is described. This chapter also includes aspects of power connected to <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> aid. The empirical part presents text analyses of the donor countries´ <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> policies. The thesis concludes that the foreign aid sector is coherent in its definition of <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> as something material or immaterial, something from the past used and valued in and by today’s society. All usual motives within foreign aid such as humanitarian, moral, economic, political and environmental are adjusted to fit in <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> aid policies. Relating to power structures, the donor countries acknowledge different kinds of power aspects within <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> aid. The conclusion that the motives vary from moral to economic reasons show that the donor countries have a great belief in the effects of <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage.</b> The <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> is mainly used through its utilitarian value. The thesis questions the notion of global responsibility and highlights the issue that <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> can foster both positive and negative forms of development.

500|$|Tourist and {{scientific}} visits to Titanic are still continuing; by April 2012, 100 {{years since the}} disaster and nearly 25 since {{the discovery of the}} wreck, around 140 people had visited. [...] On 14 April 2012 (the 100th anniversary of the ship's sinking), the wreck of the Titanic became eligible for protection under the 2001 UNESCO Convention on the Protection of <b>Underwater</b> <b>Cultural</b> <b>Heritage.</b> In the same month, Robert Ballard, the wreck's discoverer, announced a plan to preserve the wreck of the Titanic by using deep-sea robots to paint the wreck with anti-fouling paint, to help keep the wreck in its current state for all time. The proposed plan that Ballard announced has been outlined in a documentary made to time with the Titanic's 100th sinking anniversary called Save the Titanic With Bob Ballard where Ballard himself talks about how this proposed paint job on the wreck will work. Ballard says that he proposed to robotically clean and repaint the Titanic with a colour scheme mimicking rusticles because he saw [...] "original anti-fouling paint on the ship's hull, which was still working even after 74 years on the seabed" [...] when he visited the Titanic in 1986.|$|E

On 28 June 2011 it was reported that the museum was postponing the show. The Sackler Gallery has received condemnation of the exhibition due to the time-frame and nature of the original excavation of the artefacts; with arguments put forwards about whether the display should be allowed. According to The New York Times, [...] "a group of archaeologists and anthropologists from the National Academy of Sciences — including Robert McCormick Adams, a former leader of the Smithsonian" [...] wrote {{to the head of the}} Smithsonian Institution, G. Wayne Clough, on 5 April 2011 claiming that [...] "proceeding with the exhibition would 'severely damage the stature and reputation' of the institution." [...] Proponents of the arguments against display say that the excavation was for commercial gain and conducted so quickly as to have caused a loss of information pertaining to the crew and cargo. The New York Times article goes on to say that further comments were made by [...] "the Society for American Archaeology, the Council of American Maritime Museums and the International Committee for <b>Underwater</b> <b>Cultural</b> <b>Heritage,</b> as well as groups within the Smithsonian, including the members of the anthropology department and the Senate of Scientists at its National Museum of Natural History" [...] all asking that the Smithsonian reconsider the exhibition. There are also claims that exhibiting the artefacts would be against international agreements on underwater excavations. Kimberly L. Faulk, a marine archaeologist and vice chairwoman of the non-governmental Advisory Council on Underwater Archaeology said that, [...] "by proceeding with the exhibition the Smithsonian — which is a research institution as well as a network of museums — would be violating its own set of professional ethics and promoting the looting of archaeological sites." ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> {{has become}} {{something}} of an in-word in recent times. Intangible <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage,</b> however, is a category that has received relatively little attention. This folkloristic study focuses on intangible <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> as concept and as process. Folkloristics as a scholarly branch emphasizes non-material culture. Consequently, there is a big potential in bringing existing knowledge of folklore together with current scholarly theories concerning <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> in order to expand the understanding of intangible <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage.</b> In this thesis <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> is regarded as a symbolic construct, which is spoken of and discussed in specific ways. The study of intangible <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> (Swe. kulturarv) as concept focuses on this area. For a cultural component to be experienced as intangible <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> it is, however, not enough to discuss it in those terms. Instead, <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> status needs to be acted out during lengthy processes. This is demonstrated by the study of intangible <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> as process. As a consequence performativity appears crucial to an understanding of <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> – when a sufficient number of people speak and act as if a cultural component has a special status, it will also be perceived as <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage.</b> In this dissertation intangible <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> is studied through cultural analysis, more specifically through discourse analysis. The usage of the concept intangible <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> within <b>cultural</b> organizations, in scholarly use and in the Swedish-speaking press in Finland is examined. Traditional music in the Swedish-speaking districts of Finland is used as a case study of intangible <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> as process. The examination concerns how traditional music, an intangible cultural component, has been discussed, transformed, standardized and objectified in a <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> process. <b>Cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> is generally used as a token of value so that certain cultural components, both intangible and tangible, which are discussed in terms of <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> are perceived to be valuable and should therefore be safeguarded. Intangible <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> depends on performance, that is practitioners use their bodies to act out their traditional knowledge through song, handicraft, storytelling and so on. Intangible cultural components can be transmitted to other individuals in a performance situation, and they can also be documented. In Finland documentation and subsequent filing in archives have been associated with safeguarding of intangible <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage.</b> If the aim of safeguarding is to uphold traditional practices, which is the case for among others UNESCO’s programs aimed at intangible <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage,</b> other efforts are called for: forms of safeguarding that support performance and transmission...|$|R
