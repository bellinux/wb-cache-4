40|$|The data {{collected}} by NA 48 / 2 in 2003 – 2004 allowed several precise measurements in the charged kaon decay sector. In this paper we present the results obtained using a sample of 2. 5 × 106 K ± → π 0 µ ±ν (Kµ 3) and 4. 0 × 106 K ± → π 0 l ±ν (Ke 3) events, collected in 2004 using a minimal trigger conﬁguration. This <b>unbiassed</b> <b>sample</b> of kaon decays allows a high precision measurement of the semileptonic form factors...|$|E
40|$|The RoboPol {{instrument}} and the relevant program {{was developed in}} order to conduct a systematic study of the optical polarisation variability of blazars. Driven by the discovery that long smooth rotations of the optical polarisation plane {{can be associated with}} the activity in other bands and especially in gamma rays, the program was meant to investigate the physical mechanisms causing them and quantify the optical polarisation behaviour in blazars. Over the first three nominal observing seasons (2013, 2014 and 2015) RoboPol detected 40 rotations in 24 blazars by observing a gamma-ray-loud and gamma-ray-quite <b>unbiassed</b> <b>sample</b> of blazars, providing a reliable set of events for exploring the phenomenon. The obtain datasets provided the ground for a systematic quantification of the variability of the optical polarisation in such systems. In the following after a brief review of the discoveries that relate to the gamma-ray loudness of the sources we move on to discuss a simple jet model that explains the observed dichotomy in terms of polarisation between gamma-ray-loud and quite sources and the dependence of polarisation and the stability of the polarisation angle on the synchrotron peak frequency.

40|$|The Danish Multiple Sclerosis Registry was {{established}} in 1948 in continuation with a nationwide survey of the prevalence of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in Denmark. The register has since collected information on MS patients from all Danish departments of neurology, practising neurologists, MS rehabilitation centres, the National Patient Registry, the Danish MS Society, and departments of neuropathology. The registry is linked with the Danish Central Population Registry. The completeness has been estimated at more than 90 %. All cases are reclassified by two neurologists as to diagnosis and year of onset. 12 070 cases with a confirmed diagnosis of MS are kept in the databases. They were prevalent in 1949 or have had onset in the period 1948 – 1993. The registry is continuously updated with new information on registered cases and new cases. The crude average annual incidence rate 1980 – 89 was 4. 99 / 105; the prevalence rate was 112 / 105 by 1 January 1990. Cross-linking with other registers have enabled analytical prospective epidemiological studies, and the registry has provided population based <b>unbiassed</b> <b>samples</b> of patients {{for a number of}} clinical studies...|$|R
