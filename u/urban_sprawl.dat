40|$|HIV related stigmatizing attitudes {{constitute}} one of {{the greatest}} stumbling blocks to the fight against the HIV epidemic the world over. The study examined the different levels of stigmatizing attitudes expressed by religious adherents of Orthodox, Pentecostal/Charismatic, African Independent Churches, Islam and African Traditional Religion in <b>urban</b> <b>sprawling</b> and industrial communities of Ghana. The study used structured questionnaire administered during forenoon services and snowball techniques to gather the information. An in-depth interview technique was also used to gather information from key informants on the topic. The outcome of the research indicated that generally expressions of HIV related stigmatizing attitudes were high in the two study areas. While expressions of HIV related shame stigmatizing and judgmental attitudes tended to be higher in Ashaiman Municipality, <b>Urban</b> <b>Sprawling</b> community, expressions of fear of casual contact were the case in the Tema Municipality, an industrial community. In addressing this problem there is the need to educate religious adherents about the epidemic and to express love and compassion towards persons living with HIV/AIDS.

5|$|A {{study by}} the National Audubon Society has found that populations of some the most common birds in North America have {{plummeted}} since 1967, with some species showing a decline of 80 percent. The {{study also found that}} California species were particularly affected, with population declines of 75 to 96 percent for several species, including the northern pintail, horned lark and loggerhead shrike. The decline may be due to loss of habitat to <b>urban</b> <b>sprawl,</b> especially grasslands, forests and wetlands, energy development and industrialized agriculture.

5|$|Reactions {{to the new}} freeway {{were not}} all positive. In a special {{editorial}} in The Grand Rapids Press after the freeway opened in 2004, local resident Curt MacDougall summarized the criticisms of the new freeway. He cited the loss of rural farmland and wetlands as a negative effect of the highway. The editorial also discussed that the freeway does decrease travel times for some residents, but it will mean increased development. That development will mean further <b>urban</b> <b>sprawl,</b> and could spur the creation of additional highways in the area.|$|E

In the early 21st century, Albany has experienced growth in the high-technology industry, with great strides in the nanotechnology sector.|$|E

Major upgrades {{took place in}} the 1870s, the 1910s and the 1960s, each trying to add additional platforms and space while trying to preserve the existing services and architecture as much as possible. Paddington was first served by London Underground trains in 1863, as the original western terminus of the Metropolitan Railway, the world's first underground railway. In the 20th century, suburban and commuter services appeared at Paddington as the <b>urban</b> <b>sprawl</b> of London moved westwards.

Uncontrolled <b>urban</b> <b>sprawl</b> has challenged the city's infrastructure, producing shortages of clean water and electricity, sanitation and public health problems, and heavy traffic congestion. There are more than 5,000 church buildings in the city and its suburbs, including an Anglican and a Roman Catholic cathedral. Antananarivo is the see city of Madagascar's Roman Catholic Archdiocese. The city has repeatedly been the site of large demonstrations and violent political clashes, including the 1972 rotaka that brought down president Philibert Tsiranana and the 2009 Malagasy political crisis, which resulted in Andry Rajoelina replacing Marc Ravalomanana as head of state.|$|E
5|$|More people {{joined the}} middle class in the 1950s, with more money to spend, and the {{availability}} of consumer goods expanded along with the economy, including the automobile. Americans were spending more time in their automobiles and viewing them as an extension of their identity, which helped to fuel a boom in automobile sales. Most businesses directly or indirectly related to the auto industry saw tremendous growth during the decade. New designs and innovations appealed to a generation tuned into fashion and glamour, and the new-found freedom and way of life in the suburbs had several unforeseen consequences for the inner cities. The 1950s saw the beginning of white flight and <b>urban</b> <b>sprawl,</b> driven by increasing automobile ownership. Many local and national transportation laws encouraged suburbanization, which in time ended up damaging the cities economically.|$|E

In sustainable architecture the recent movement of New Classical Architecture promotes a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops smart growth, architectural tradition and classical design. This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture, as well as opposing solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl. Both trends started in the 1980s.

The crux is lack of a system provided for making the effectiveness and efficiency of TOD strategies and programs. Thus, this paper aims at illustrating about sustainable development and TOD. In order to provide workable tools for achieving TOD goals, an evaluation model and implementation tools are suggested.

5|$|The {{major threat}} for crested and marbled newts is habitat loss. This {{concerns}} especially breeding sites, which are lost through the upscaling and intensification of agriculture, drainage, <b>urban</b> <b>sprawl,</b> and artificial flooding regimes (affecting {{in particular the}} Danube crested newt). Especially in the southern ranges, exploitation of groundwater and decreasing spring rain, possibly caused by global warming, threaten breeding ponds. Aquatic habitats are also degraded through pollution with agricultural pesticides and fertiliser. Introduction of crayfish and predatory fish threatens larval development; the Chinese sleeper {{has been a major}} concern in Eastern Europe. Exotic plants can also degrade habitats: the swamp stonecrop replaces natural vegetation and overshadows waterbodies in the United Kingdom, and its hard leaves are unsuitable for egg-laying to crested newts.|$|E

Though some have blamed the city's low density, <b>urban</b> <b>sprawl,</b> and lack of pedestrian-friendliness on these policies, the city's land use has also been credited with having significant affordable housing, sparing Houston the worst effects of the 2008 real estate crisis.

According to Narain, [...] "our <b>urban</b> <b>sprawls</b> such as Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai, Srinagar, etc., have not paid adequate attention to the natural water bodies that exist in them. In Chennai, each of its lakes has a natural flood discharge channel which drains the spillover. But we have built over many of these water bodies, blocking the smooth flow of water. We have forgotten the art of drainage. We only see land for buildings, not for water." [...] According to research conducted by CSE, Chennai had over 600 lakes in the 1980s, but a master plan published in 2008 showed only a fraction of them to be in a healthy condition.
