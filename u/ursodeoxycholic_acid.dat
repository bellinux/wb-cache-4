40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} shown that the {{partitioning}} of vinblastine in 1, 2 -dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) single and multiple bilayer dispersions induces partial interdigitation of the lipid alkyl chains. Similar behavior has been observed for abietic and <b>ursodeoxycholic</b> <b>acids</b> and may well be generalized for the partitioning of bulky amphoteric molecules, which tend to localize {{in the vicinity of the}} polar heads. For the present study, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) has been employed to investigate the role of lipid molecular characteristics such as the alkyl chain length and the polarity of the head-group, as well as the impact of cholesterol upon vinblastine-induced interdigitation. It is found that vinblastine does not induce interdigitation in lipids with either shorter or longer alkyl chains than DPPC, or having head-groups of different polarity. In addition, it is shown that the presence of cholesterol in the lipid bilayer tends to modulate the phase behavior of the lipid/vinblastine bilayer system. Preliminary studies show that such properties directly affect the encapsulation efficiency and the pharmacokinetics of liposomes...|$|R

The subunit molecular weight was calculated to be about 56, 000. The enzyme was separated from bile acid UDP-glucuronosyltransferase [UDP-glucuronate beta-D-glucuronosyltransferase (acceptor-unspecific), EC 2. 4. 1. 17] during purification and does not catalyze the formation of bile acid glucuronides. The purified glucosyltransferase utilizes lipophilic alkyl beta-D-glucopyranosides as artificial donor substrates and dolichyl phosphoglucose as natural donor for the transfer of glucose to bile acids and does not exhibit bile acid conjugating activity {{in the presence of}} sugar nucleotides such as UDP-glucose. The apparent Km values estimated for various alkyl beta-D-glucopyranosides decreased with increasing alkyl chain length from 680 X 10 (- 6) M for hexyl beta-D-glucopyranoside to 20 X 10 (- 6) M as estimated for decyl and dodecyl beta-D-glucopyranoside.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effects of}} bile acids and other organic anions on the {{secretion}} of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) were evaluated in rat hepatocytes in primary culture. Incubation of cells with portal blood concentrations (10 - 200 microM) of bile acids resulted in dose-dependent suppression of secretion of VLDL-associated [3 H]triglyceride (TG) formed from [3 H]glycerol, and also of TG mass. The degree of the inhibition was highly correlated with intracellular bile acid concentration. Prolonged incubation with 100 microM extracellular taurocholic acid (TC) decreased the secretion of [3 H]TG and TG mass to 35 % and 50 % of the controls respectively. Cellular content of mass and of [3 H]TG during prolonged incubation with TC were about 20 % and 60 % higher than the controls respectively. The inhibitory effect remained for at least 24 h in the presence of TC without altering VLDL-lipid and VLDL-apolipoprotein compositions or the size distribution of the particles. Secretion of apoB- 100 and of apoB- 48 was inhibited to a similar extent. Cells largely lost their capacity to accumulate bile acids intracellularly after 48 h in culture. In these cells TC was unable to exert its suppressive effects. Taurine and glycine conjugates of all common bile acids were capable of suppressing [3 H]TG secretion. Trihydroxylated (cholic acid) and various dihydroxylated (deoxycholic, chenodeoxycholic and <b>ursodeoxycholic</b> <b>acids)</b> bile acids had similar capacities in this respect, suggesting that their common sterol- 3 alpha-OH structure is required for the suppressive effect. Neither non-bile acid organic anions, e. g. bilirubin ditaurate and dibromosulphthalein, nor dianionic bile acid metabolites, e. g. sulphated taurolithocholic acid and lithocholate- 3 -O-glucuronide, showed any effect on [3 H]TG secretion.

Whereas no organ-specific differences in the affinities of individual bile acids to hepatic and extrahepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferases were observed, the individual bile acids showed reaction rates in liver that were about twice the rates estimated in kidney and about twice to three times the rates observed in duodenal mucosa. In intestinal mucosa the rate of chenodeoxycholic acid glucuronidation exhibited a progressive decrease from duodenum to colon, where it was 30 % of the duodenal level. Comparison of the glucuronidation rates that were estimated with different bile acids in hepatic or extrahepatic tissues showed that for each organ a bile acid structure-activity relationship existed, with highest activity observed for lithocholic and <b>ursodeoxycholic</b> <b>acids,</b> which was about twofold higher compared with chenodeoxycholic or deoxycholic acids.

40|$|Subtotal {{colectomy}} and ileorectal anastomosis in {{familial adenomatous polyposis}} {{patients can}} induce temporary regression of adenomas in the rectum. The mechanism for this phenomenon is unclear. We evaluated the effect of colectomy on rectal mucosal proliferation, in relation to changes in bile acid metabolism. Four familial adenomatous polyposis patients were studied before and 3 - 6 months after surgery, and eight others 7 - 22 years postoperatively. Within 6 months after surgery, {{the size of the}} proliferative zone of the colonic crypts was found to be reduced (P < 0. 05). The proliferative activity of total colonic crypts was not affected within this period. More than 7 years postoperatively, increased cell proliferation of total crypts (P < 0. 02), as well as mid (P < 0. 05) and basal (P < 0. 05) crypt compartments, were observed compared to shortly after colectomy. In duodenal bile, deoxycholic acid was absent shortly after operation, whereas several years after operation only a small fraction (2 %) was present. Fecal secondary bile acid excretion diminished after colectomy and did not change several years postoperatively. In postoperative stools only, small proportions of ursocholic and <b>ursodeoxycholic</b> <b>acids</b> (about 5 % each) were consistently found. As subtotal colectomy causes a temporary decrease in the length of the proliferative zone of rectal crypts toward a normal pattern, this may explain regression of rectal polyps.

Each of the unconjugated bile acids examined inhibited the transport and tissue uptake of 5 -CH 3 H 4 PteGlu in a concentration dependent manner. At low concentrations (0. 01 - 0. 1 mM) of cholic and deoxycholic acids, no structural or functional damage to the intestinal mucosa occurred and the transport of 5 -CH 3 H 4 PteGlu was inhibited competitively with Ki values of 0. 114 mM and 0. 055 mM for cholic and deoxycholic acids, respectively. The greater inhibition of 5 -CH 3 H 4 PteGlu transport by unconjugated bile acids at 1 mM {{can be attributed to}} observed structural and functional damage to the intestinal mucosa. The addition of 2 mM lecithin to the mucosal medium failed to prevent the inhibitory effect of 0. 1 mM deoxycholic acid on the transport of 0. 5 microM 5 -CH 3 H 4 PteGlu. Compared with the effect of unconjugated bile acids, the conjugated bile acid taurocholic acid (0. 01 - 5 mM) showed no effect on the transport and tissue uptake of 5 -CH 3 H 4 PteGlu. The results of this study show that intestinal transport and tissue uptake of 5 -CH 3 H 4 PteGlu are inhibited by unconjugated bile acids in a dose-dependent fashion.

This study investigated whether guar gum and pectin-two fibers with distinct functional characteristics-affect BA profiles, microbiota composition, and gut metabolites in rats. Low- (LM) or high-methoxylated (HM) pectin, and low-, medium-, or high-molecular-weight (MW) guar gum were administered to rats that were fed either low- or high-fat diets. Cecal BAs, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and microbiota composition, and plasma lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) levels were analyzed, by using novel methodologies based on gas chromatography (BAs and SCFAs) and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Strong correlations were observed between cecal BA and SCFA levels, microbiota composition, and portal plasma LBP levels in rats on a high-fat diet. Notably, guar gum consumption with medium-MW increased the cecal amounts of cholic-, chenodeoxycholic-, and <b>ursodeoxycholic</b> <b>acids</b> as well as α-, β-, and ù-muricholic acids {{to a greater extent than}} other types of guar gum or the fiber-free control diet. In contrast, the amounts of cecal deoxycholic- and hyodeoxycholic acid were reduced with all types of guar gum independent of chain length. Differences in BA composition between pectin groups were less obvious, but cecal levels of α- and ù-muricholic acids were higher in rats fed LM as compared to HM pectin or the control diet. The inflammatory marker LBP was downregulated in rats fed medium-MW guar gum and HM pectin; these two fibers decreased the cecal abundance of Oscillospira and an unclassified genus in Ruminococcaceae, and increased that of an unclassified family in RF 32.

Initially, the acidity constants of cholic, deoxycholic, chenodeoxycholic and dehidrocholic acids and their glycine conjugated in an aqueous solution whose ionic strength was adjusted to 0. 15 mol dm"-" 3 with NaCI were determined by potentiometric titration. These determinations were carried out either using bile acids or bile acids salts aqueous solutions at three different temperatures (10, 25 and 37 deg C), which also allowed the evaluation of the temperature effect on the pK_a. The glycocholic acid acidity constants were also determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy under the same experimental conditions. The cholic, chenodeoxycholic and <b>ursodeoxycholic</b> <b>acids</b> acidity constants were determined by potentiometric titration at 25 deg C in various methanol/water solutions of different co-solvent concentrations. The pK_a values in water were calculated by extrapolation for 0 % methanol.

40|$|To {{elucidate}} the mechanism {{responsible for the}} bile acid-induced changes of biliary lipid secretion, we evaluated bile flow and biliary output of bile acids, cholesterol, phospholipids, and alkaline phosphatase activity in seven cholecystectomized subjects with a balloon occludable T-tube during two experimental periods: (a) depletion of the endogenous bile acid pool and (b) replacement of the pool by means of duodenal infusion with individual bile acids, such as deoxycholic (DCA), chenodeoxycholic (CDCA), cholic (CA), and <b>ursodeoxycholic</b> (UDCA) <b>acids.</b> Bile flow, cholesterol, and phospholipid output were linearly related to bile acid secretion in all experimental periods. During the replacement periods, the amount of cholesterol and phospholipids coupled to bile acids was significantly different (at 1 % level at least) for each individual bile acid secreted; it was the highest during DCA secretion (slope value: 0. 209 for cholesterol and 0. 434 for phospholipids) followed, in the order, by CDCA (0. 078 and 1. 794), CA (0. 044 and 0. 127), and UDCA (0. 030 and 0. 122). The phospholipid to cholesterol ratio was higher during secretion of CA and UDCA as compared with DCA and CDCA. The secretion of CA seemed to stimulate a greater bile flow than the other bile acids did.

The mean highest increase (13 -fold the pretreatment value) was observed during DCA secretion followed by CDCA (fivefold) and CA (1. 5 -fold). These results would suggest that the physical chemical properties, namely the lipid-solubilizing capacity, of bile acids could directly contribute to the regulation of biliary lipid secretion.

40|$|The {{process of}} drug discovery, by which new {{potential}} medicines are discovered, {{is a long}} and intricate path that can be approached with many different strategies. For a long time, drugs have been discovered by studying secondary metabolites produced by plants and other organisms mainly as defense or {{as a way to}} interact with competitors and mutualists. During recent years, high-throughput screening (HTS) of large compounds libraries has become very popular since it promised to drastically fasten the process of hit identification though requiring consistent initial investments. However, despite the rise of combinatorial chemistry {{as an integral part of}} the lead discovery process, natural products still play a major role as starting material for drug discovery. In fact, a 2012 report found that of the 175 small molecule new chemical entities developed as anticancer agents since 1940 s, 48. 6 % were natural derived or semi synthetic derivatives of natural products. During my PhD, I had the chance to work in different laboratories thus gaining knowledge in different fields ranging from natural products chemistry to HTS by NMR, two approaches that converge in the common purpose of identifying and optimizing pharmacologically active molecules. At the department of Pharmacy, in Naples, under the guidance of Prof. D'Auria and Prof. Zampella, I focused on isolation, characterization and synthetic studies of naturally-occurring compounds working on two different projects: isolation and characterization of secondary metabolites from natural sources; and design, synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of dual agonists of bile acid receptors. The investigation of bioactive natural products from the Indian soft coral Sinularia inelegans led to the isolation of a novel norcembranoid, named 5 -epi-norcembrenolide, along with twelve known compounds, which were characterized by means of high resolution mass spectrometry and 1 D and 2 D NMR experiments. All the isolated compounds, including sinuleptolide and 5 -epi-sinuleptolide for which anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities had already been reported, are actually under pharmacological investigation to evaluate their antimicrobial activity and binding to nuclear receptors. As regards dual agonists of bile acid receptors, the project involved a preliminary synthetic study in order to produce the reference compound INT- 767 and several analogs that were all synthesized starting from the commercially available chenodeoxycholic and <b>ursodeoxycholic</b> <b>acids.</b> Semi synthetic derivatives were tested in vitro and in vivo to evaluate their activity on the bile acid receptors FXR and GP-BAR 1. One of the compounds turned out to be the most potent dual FXR/GP-BAR 1 agonist so far reported and docking studies elucidated its binding mode in the ligand binding domains of the two receptors revealing the structural requisites to achieve potent GP-BAR 1 /FXR dual agonism. This study is relevant for further investigations on the functional mechanism of these two receptors and for the design of novel dual GP-BAR 1 /FXR agonists, providing new opportunities for the treatment of enterohepatic and metabolic disorders. The second part of my thesis was carried out at Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, in San Diego, California, tutored by prof. Pellecchia and Dr. Barile. I applied a new screening technique known as HTS by NMR - which involves a target-based screening of combinatorial libraries using NMR as detection method - to the study of protein-protein interactions. The research conducted on the BIR 3 domain of XIAP, an inhibitor of apoptosis protein, resulted in the identification of an inhibitor with a potency comparable to the one of the clinical candidate GDC- 0152 by Genentech (Kd~ 30 nM), which went through a phase I clinical trial as anticancer agent, but endowed with a more favorable thermodynamic profile and a higher binding specificity. The compound was subjected to a process of medicinal optimization and three prodrugs are currently being tested to evaluate their ability of delivering the active molecule inside the cells. At the same time, I studied the ligand binding domain of EphA 3, a tyrosine kinase receptor overexpressed in several types of cancer and involved in stem cells maintenance. The EphA 3 -LBD has been expressed for the first time in a soluble 13 C-Met-labeled form. By using HTS by NMR as screening method we identified first small molecule EphA 3 binders endowed with good selectivity between the homolog receptors EphA 3 and EphA 4, and with dissociation constants against EphA 3 in the range of 5 - 10 µM. These binders will be further optimized in order to afford a useful tool to deepen our knowledge of EphA 3 pathological role in cancer development...|$|R
