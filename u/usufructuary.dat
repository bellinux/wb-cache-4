25|$|Since {{some of the}} Renaissance {{changes were}} done in haste (especially the wooden roof), as early as in 1616 a new, gradual Early Baroque {{reconstruction}} started based on a design by the main imperial architect Giovanni Battista Carlone. The works were intensified in 1635 and finished around 1647. It was mostly financed by Count Paul Pálffy (Pálfi), {{the captain of the}} castle and county head of Pozsony county. The look the castle received through this conversion is basically the look the castle has kept till the present. The northern and western part of the main building have been newly built and a new, 3rd floor was added in the whole building, the main entrance was shifted back {{to the middle of the}} wall, the ancient fortifications were improved, the chapel was shifted from the southern part to the northern part (today’s Musical Hall), and 2 new towers were added– yielding in sum the present 4 towers in the corners. As a reward for not having misappropriated state funds during the conversion, the Diet appointed Count Paul Pálffy lifelong captain of Pressburg Castle, county head of the Pozsony county and <b>usufructuary</b> of the castle (which remained in possession of the crown) in 1650. One year later, the emperor made those functions and titles hereditary for the Pálffys.|$|E
50|$|A {{usufruct}} is {{a limited}} real right, typically employed when a testator wishes to provide for surviving family members after his death, but wants the property to go to someone other than the <b>usufructuary.</b> The <b>usufructuary</b> may use and enjoy the property, which can be either movable or immovable, corporeal or incorporeal, and draw and acquire ownership of the property's fruits, which may be either natural (like crops and the young of livestock) or civil (such as rental income and interest on a capital investment). The <b>usufructuary</b> must gather the natural fruits {{in order to obtain}} ownership of them. Civil fruits, on the other hand, are acquired by the <b>usufructuary</b> as soon as they become due. A usufruct cannot extend beyond the life of the <b>usufructuary,</b> who, not being the owner of the property, is not entitled to alienate or consume or destroy it. The <b>usufructuary</b> interest may, however, be alienated or pledged or mortgaged or sold in execution.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a case study of}} how church, land and {{dispossession}} of land has influenced identity formation of a coloured community in the Eastern Province, namely the Klipfontein community. Coloured history in the Eastern Province has largely been neglected. This study attempts to rectify such a lack of in-depth enquiry as it may lead to misinterpretations that may influence contemporary politics and identity formation. Through research based on primary sources, it is evident that the social landscape of Klipfontein Farm and the relationships between that community and surrounding black African and white communities have largely been shaped by the stipulations contained in the joint will of the community’s ancestors: Dirk and Sarah Janse van Rensburg. The land devolved into a trust and has been administered by trustees since the death of the first spouse in 1877. By keeping the land in a trust, it enabled the descendants to continue to live on the farm in perpetuity, without the risk of being forced off the land via financial restraints or racially-based legislation. But the <b>usufructuaries</b> could also never fully utilise Klipfontein as an agricultural concern due to a combination of a lack of equipment and skill, and the provisions of the will. These complications inevitably led to inter-familial disputes and tension. Before 1939 there had already been three court cases dealing with the interpretations of the Will. In that same year the Supreme Court ordered that tracts of the land, including a part of Boesmansriviermond village, be sold in order to pay off arrear rates and taxes. Although the responsibility for these sales lay with the trustees, the community has been suspicious of the <b>usufructuaries</b> ever since. A key element of the Klipfontein identity is their religion. The church legitimises their right to the farm - against those who wish to take that right away. Their claim to occupation is couched in scriptural discourse, viewing Klipfontein as 'their Garden of Eden' that God gave to the stamvader, Dirk Janse van Rensburg. This seemed to have been partially successful for the Klipfontein community in staving off harassment by authorities. It also caused friction between the community and the black African residents. Some <b>usufructuaries</b> and family members felt that such right was exclusively given to the coloured community and so they became increasingly annoyed by the black Africans who settled there. Other <b>usufructuaries</b> did not share this feeling. They allowed evicted black African farm labourers to settle on certain portions of Klipfontein until the late 1970 s. The black African population rapidly increased due to misinformation and evictions from neighbouring farms. This only further exacerbated the inter-familial conflict between <b>usufructuaries,</b> flaring tensions between the black Africans and their reluctant hosts as well as animosity from the white community towards Klipfontein. In 1979, after a series of court cases, a decision was made to remove all the African settlers by force and relocate most of them to the ‘homeland’ of Ciskei. The rest, who were of ‘working-age’ were left behind in a ‘temporary emergency camp’ on the outskirts of Kenton-on-Sea. The effects of these removals still impact the relationships between the different racial groups in the area to this day...|$|R

The parties in proceedings con¬cerning damages should be the persons who were owners Or perpetual <b>usufructuaries</b> of the real estate when the decision determrning the road project location became final.

50|$|In Durban v Woodhaven, {{the court}} {{questioned}} the fine distinction drawn between the usufruct {{itself and the}} right of enjoyment comprised by the <b>usufructuary</b> interest. This decision implies that the nature and purpose of a particular personal servitude should determine whether the rights under the servitude are alienable. The usufructuary's rights include possession, administration, use and enjoyment of the property, as well as its natural and civil fruits. Consumable property cannot be the object of a usufruct, since the <b>usufructuary</b> must be able to give the property back to the owner salva rei substantia (or substantially intact) {{at the end of the}} <b>usufructuary</b> period. The <b>usufructuary</b> must use the property reasonably: that is, for the purpose for which it was intended. The owner of the property retains all the rights of ownership, subject to the usufruct, and may therefore alienate or mortgage the property, subject to the usufruct.|$|E
50|$|Under Roman law, {{usufruct}} was a type {{of personal}} servitude (servitutes personarum), a beneficial right in another's property. The <b>usufructuary</b> never had possession of this property (on the basis that if he possessed at all, he did so through the owner), {{but he did have}} an interest in the property itself for a period, either a term of years, or a lifetime. Unlike the owner, the <b>usufructuary</b> did not have a right of alienation (abusus), but he could sell or lease his usufructory interest. Even though a <b>usufructuary</b> did not have possessory title, he could sue for relief {{in the form of a}} modified possessory interdict (prohibiting order).|$|E

40|$|Rarely {{does one}} come across {{critical}} analysis which looks at islands as the strategic and candid promoters {{of a role}} as political and economic <b>usufructuaries</b> over external resources. This paper is premised on the proposition that a small territory is especially obliged to use extra-territorial resources as its hinterland for economic success. Such resources extend over {{a whole range of}} goods and services and include access to investment, welfare, security, stable currency, international relations, specialised labour power, transfers, markets and higher education. The MIRAB syndrome is one way of articulating this condition. This paper proposes a second cluster of features that are, or can be, deployed by small territories in a manner somewhat different from MIRAB; this second cluster has a more proactive policy orientation and a disposition towards carving out procedural and jurisdictional powers. It is thus proposed to consider a small territory’s engagement with the external hinterland as a position on a sliding scale, a strategic mix of options located between two distinct development trajectories, of which MIRAB is one and the PROFIT model the otherpeer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In Poland, 82 % {{of forests}} are State-owned, and only 17 % of forests {{constitute}} private property. Each year, forests are converted to other land-use types, mainly for road construction. The afforestation rate on privately-owned low-productivity land is decreasing steadily. The owners and perpetual <b>usufructuaries</b> {{of this kind}} of land are eligible to government subsidies to cover establishment expenditures in whole or in part, provided that the afforestation scheme complies with the local zoning plan or an outline planning permission. The above creates a dilemma for farmers—is this a profitable option of managing low-productivity land? Owners of small farms particularly often face such dilemmas. Owners of small farms, which consist of low-yield agricultural land, can be regarded as investors operating on the real estate market, but those investors have features characteristic of agricultural producers. This study relied on the net present value (NPV) criterion, which is popularly used to assess the effectiveness of investments on the real estate market. A financial feasibility assessment performed with the use of such method in view of afforestation statistics and the 5 % discount rate on the Polish forest market revealed the highest increase in net cumulative cash flows in the first five years, followed by a gradual decrease in successive years. The first negative cash flow was reported in year 20. NPV would remain negative because farmers would be charged with periodic maintenance expenditures until the stand reaches harvestable age at approximately 40 years. The longer the investment period, the lower the profits, even if discount rate is excluded. Investments of the type are difficult to terminate because forests younger than 20 years are difficult to sell at a price that covers growing outflows. Afforestation projects are also influenced by other economic and non-economic factors. The paper validates the research hypothesis that afforestation is a long-term investment that delivers benefits for future generations...|$|R
50|$|These two {{interests}} {{are similar in}} some respects, but they differ in others. They are very much alike, in that both a <b>usufructuary</b> and a fiduciary have the use and the enjoyment of the property for their lifetime; they differ in that, whereas a <b>usufructuary</b> can never automatically acquire any greater right in the property, a fiduciary’s right may {{in his or her}} lifetime ripen into absolute ownership (if, for example, the fideicommissary dies before him).|$|E

The limited interest conferred on the survivor is, as a rule, either a <b>usufructuary</b> or a fiduciary interest. For example, the testators leave “all property belonging to us to our children, subject to a usufruct in favour of the survivor;” in this case the survivor acquires a <b>usufructuary</b> interest in the massed property. Or, again, the testators may leave “our joint estate to the survivor, and after the death of the survivor to our children;” in this case the survivor acquires a fiduciary interest.|$|E

5000|$|Usufruct {{comes from}} civil law, under {{which it is}} a {{subordinate}} real right (ius in re aliena) of limited duration, usually for a person's lifetime.

50|$|It is {{frequently}} difficult to ascertain from a will {{which of these}} interests a testator intended to grant. The law reports contain numerous instances of the courts’ being requested to interpret wills where one party contends that the interest is <b>usufructuary</b> and the other claims that it is fiduciary.

50|$|The {{presumption}} {{in favour}} of a direct substitution does not arise if {{it is clear that}} the testator intended to grant different interests in the same property to two persons, not alternatively but either successively (as in the case of a fideicommissum) or concurrently (as in the case where the ownership is left to one person subject to a usufruct {{in favour of}} another); in other words, there is no presumption that the interest of the beneficiary first mentioned is an ownership subject to a direct substitution, nor is there a presumption that his interest is <b>usufructuary</b> and not fiduciary.|$|E
50|$|Most libertarians (such as {{free market}} {{environmental}}ists and Objectivists) believe environmental damage {{is more often}} than not a result of state ownership and mismanagement of natural resources, for example by the military-industrial complex, and claim that private ownership of all natural resources will result in a better environment, as a private owner of property will have more incentive to ensure the longer term value of the property.

50|$|A usufruct, {{which is}} often {{confused}} with the fideicommissum, essentially forms part {{of the law of}} property, although it is often used in wills. A testator bequeaths the property rights to one person (the dominus or remainderman), but the right to use, enjoy and take the fruits of the property to another (the <b>usufructuary).</b> In other words, instead of leaving the full ownership of the estate, or of a specified thing, to one person, the testator may leave the ownership to one person, subject to a usufruct in favour of another person. For example, the testator leaves “my farm to A subject to a life usufruct in favour of B.” On the testator’s death, both of these interests vest, the usufruct in B, and the remaining rights of ownership in A.|$|E

5000|$|Slash-and-burn {{fields are}} {{typically}} used and {{owned by a}} family until the soil is exhausted. At this point the ownership rights are abandoned, the family clears a new field, and trees and shrubs are permitted to grow on the former field. After a few decades, another family or clan may then use the land and claim <b>usufructuary</b> rights. In such a system there is typically no market in farmland, so land is not bought or sold in the open market and land rights are traditional. In slash-and-burn agriculture, forests are typically cut months before a dry season. The [...] "slash" [...] is permitted to dry, and then burned in the following dry season. The resulting ash fertilizes the soil and the burned field is then planted {{at the beginning of}} the next rainy season with crops such as upland rice, maize, cassava, or other staples. Most of this work is typically done by hand, using such basic tools as machetes, axes, hoes, and makeshift shovels.|$|E
50|$|Firstly, the lex {{applied only}} where the aggrieved person was the dominus. The praetor {{provided}} an actio utilis, or one in factum, to persons with lesser property {{rights in the}} thing, e.g. the <b>usufructuary,</b> alongside the owner. Damages {{would be based on}} the value of the interest. A bona fide possessor had the action for the full value, but if ultimately sued by the owner, must give up what he had recovered. Under Justinian, but probably not before, a pledgee had it if the debtor was insolvent, or if he had from any cause lost his personal claim against the debtor. In all these cases it lay against the owner himself, as an actio in factum. Secondly, leges did not in themselves apply to persons who were not true Roman citizens but an actio ficticia was given in this case for others. Thirdly, the lex covered only cases of property. Injury of a freeman was thus not within it, as a man was not considered to own his body. The praetor gave an actio utilis to a freeman who, or whose filiusfamilias, had been injured, but not where a freeman was killed.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{suggested}} {{in the course of}} the argument for the Dominion, that inasmuch as the proclamation recites that the territories thereby reserved for Indians had never 'been ceded to or purchased by' the Crown, the entire property of the land remained with them. That inference is, however, at variance with the terms of the Proclamation, which shew that the tenure of the Indians was a personal and <b>usufructuary</b> right, dependent upon the good will of the Sovereign. The lands reserved are expressly stated to be 'parts of Our dominions and territories;' and it is declared to be the will and pleasure of the sovereign that, 'for the present,' they shall be reserved for the use of the Indians, as their hunting grounds, under his protection and dominion. There was a great deal of learned discussion at the Bar with respect to the precise quality of the Indian right, but their Lordships do not consider it necessary to express any opinion upon the point. It appears to them to be sufficient for the purposes of this case that there has been all along vested in the Crown a substantial and paramount estate, underlying the Indian title, which became a plenum dominium whenever that title was surrendered or otherwise extinguished.|$|E
