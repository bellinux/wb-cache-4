25|$|Race nine showed Oracle Team USA {{at their}} best. Spithill again won the start, and {{extended}} the lead at every mark including {{for the first}} time, a notable gain against the Kiwi boat on the <b>upwind</b> <b>leg.</b> Recording consecutive victories {{for the first time}} allowed Oracle to finally get a point, with the score at 1–6.|$|E
25|$|Alcatraz Island is {{a unique}} part of the racecourse for this event. For {{the first week of}} the event, San Francisco Bay {{experienced}} flood tides during the America's Cup races. As water flowed into the bay, there was a cone close to the Island where the incoming tide was noticeably less than the rest of the racecourse. On the <b>upwind</b> <b>leg,</b> when boats have to sail against the flood tide, tactical use of this cone was crucial.|$|E
25|$|Trying to wrap {{things up}} in the first race of the day, Barker was {{aggressive}} in the pre-start. It did not pay off, and Spithill was able to get into a position where Team New Zealand was forced to keep clear. From that lead off the start line, Oracle led the whole race to win race twelve by 31 seconds on the line. During the <b>upwind</b> <b>leg,</b> Oracle's performance was excellent, which including getting up on the foils at speeds approaching 32 knots. Oracle gained their second point to take the score to 2–8.|$|E
5000|$|To {{offset the}} large sail {{area and the}} {{resulting}} significant heeling momentum there are 3 main design philosophies: 1. a deep and heavy keel; 2. {{a way to get}} the crew further off the centreline by using wings, racks, hiking aids or trapezes; and, 3. a reduction in sail area, leading to a reduction in displacement, leading to less need for sail area and thus a reduction in heeling momentum. Many modern sportsboats use some combination of 1&2 or 2&3 also, with option 1 tending to favour <b>upwind</b> <b>legs,</b> and option 3 tending to favour downwind; option 2 being an advantage in all respects except rating.|$|R
50|$|Formula boards have {{excellent}} upwind and downwind ability, {{but are not}} as comfortable on a beam reach unless fin sizes are reduced. This explains why the course is usually a box with longer <b>upwind</b> and downwind <b>legs,</b> or just a simple upwind-downwind return course.|$|R
25|$|The 34th America's Cup {{began in}} stark {{contrast}} to the one-sided races that dominated the 2013 Louis Vuitton Cup. Team New Zealand skippered by Dean Barker led at the first mark, and held it for second (first downward) leg. The gap to Oracle Team USA was only 4 seconds at the bottom mark, and during the <b>upwind</b> third <b>leg</b> the lead changed several times. Team New Zealand led at the top mark by 25 seconds, and kept the lead until the finish line, winning by 36 seconds.|$|R
25|$|Race {{fourteen}} {{was another}} {{end to end}} win by Oracle. Starting in the leeward position, Spithill again luffed Barker hard substantially past the reach mark. This set up a strong lead for the first downwind beat. On the <b>upwind</b> <b>leg</b> Team New Zealand were able to close, {{and at one point}} had to dip under the American boat. They could not press the advantage however, and Oracle led well around the top mark. Team New Zealand once again closed right up to the American boat about halfway down the fourth leg, but could not make the pass. Oracle closed out the win by 23 seconds to bring the score to 4–8.|$|E
25|$|In race {{eighteen}} the Kiwis led at {{the start}} {{and up to the}} first mark. They set the speed record of the series, reaching 47.57 knots (55mph, 88 kph) as they rounded the mark, to lead by 5 seconds. They kept the lead during the first downwind run, but Oracle got ahead at the first crossing on the <b>upwind</b> <b>leg</b> after the Kiwis made a poor tack. Team New Zealand had starboard tack advantage and the lead at the time, but did not properly cover Oracle. The American boat was up on the foils, and powered past the Kiwis. Oracle went on to lead by 57 seconds at the windward gate and kept the lead for the rest of race, winning by 54 seconds.|$|E

25|$|Race three {{initially}} {{looked good}} for Oracle as Spithill luffed Team New Zealand at the reach mark to successfully draw a penalty. Oracle held the lead {{for the first}} downwind leg, and were 18 seconds to the good heading into the <b>upwind</b> third <b>leg.</b> The pivotal moment of the race occurred when Barker brought the New Zealand boat back on port tack within three boat lengths of the boundary.

50|$|The junk rig {{typically}} produces less drive than {{a similarly}} sized Bermuda rig at low angles of attack (e.g. when sailing upwind, close-hauled) {{and this is}} especially pronounced in light wind.

40|$|International audienceAn {{implementation}} of a kite modelling approach into {{6 degrees of freedom}} sailboat dynamic simulator is introduced. This enables an evaluation of kite performance in comparison with classical rig sailing. A zero-mass model was used to model kite forces. Influence of the wind gradient was properly taken into account leading to significant modifications in the calculation of the relative wind. The modelling was performed with experimental aerodynamic characteristics. An optimization was done to determine the best kite flight trajectory in terms of performance. Validation steps of the sail yacht simulator were performed for a classical rig on the example of an 8 m one design yacht. The experimental set-up is described and validation results are discussed. Particularly, a wind mesh was used, based on measurements made at four different locations of the navigation spot. Additionally boat motions were recorded by high resolution GPS and inertial unit systems. Speed polar diagram results, reached by kite propulsion, were predicted versus true wind angle. At last a comparison was made for <b>upwind</b> and downwind <b>legs</b> in sea trials conditions, between simulations with the classical rig and the kite. It is shown that the boat towed by kite would achieve much better sailing performance...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} current {{progress made}} towards {{the realization of}} a match-racing simulator. The aim of the project {{is to be able}} to simulate and to modify typical situations while introducing quantifiable data for strategic and tactical analysis. The fundamental model consists of six fully coupled equations of the dynamics of two boats. The largest possible number of variables is taken into account, even though some are initially approximations. The influences of the three attitude angles on the hydrodynamic forces are taken into account using the ‘experiment planning method' applied to towing-tank tests. For the aerodynamics, empirical models (for example IMS) are adopted. The interaction between the two boats is obtained by representing the sail perturbation by means of a single horseshoe vortex and a self-preserved viscous plane wake. The simulator has a modular structure, which allows the progressive improvement of each part as studies and knowledge advance. Comparisons with calculations of three-dimensional flows and with wind tunnel measurements validate the interaction model. The results presented show a satisfactory agreement with the polar velocity diagram available for the studied boat, even if more reliable trials at sea are needed, with measurements of boat behaviour, wind and sea state. Simulations allow us to quantify the relative influence of model coefficients on boat behaviour. Thus it is possible to identify which factors must be improved first. Tacking simulations are used to illustrate this possibility. To conclude, an example of the practical use of the simulator is presented by comparing two tactical scenarios for the final part of the <b>upwind</b> <b>leg...</b>|$|E
