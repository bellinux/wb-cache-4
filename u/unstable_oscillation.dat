50|$|Fluttering is a {{physical}} phenomenon in which several degrees of freedom of a structure become coupled in an <b>unstable</b> <b>oscillation</b> driven by the wind. This movement inserts energy to the bridge during each cycle so that it overcomes the natural damping of the structure; the composed system (bridge-fluid) therefore behaves {{as if it had}} an effective negative damping (or had positive feedback), leading to an exponentially growing response. In other words, the oscillations increase in amplitude with each cycle because the wind pumps in more energy than the flexing of the structure can dissipate, and finally drives the bridge toward failure due to excessive deflection and stress. The wind speed that causes the beginning of the fluttering phenomenon (when the effective damping becomes zero) is known as the flutter velocity. Fluttering occurs even in low-velocity winds with steady flow. Hence, bridge design must ensure that flutter velocity will be higher than the maximum mean wind speed present at the site.|$|E

The possibility of the development of various types of instabilities in a thin gaseous disks is very attractive one for understanding different aspects of the accretion-disk (AD) phenomenon. In order to explain the required large values of dissipative coefficients, the concept of the turbulent viscosity has been used, which may be caused by the developed turbulence of a gaseous medium arising from the loss of stability. On the other hand, the nonlinear evolution of <b>unstable</b> <b>oscillation</b> modes may be responsible for many nonstationary phenomena in accreting systems. There are four <b>unstable</b> <b>oscillation</b> modes in the framework of the standard α-{{model of a}}n accretion disk [1].

40|$|Collective <b>unstable</b> <b>oscillations</b> of {{rotor blades}} {{in case of}} flatter are under study. From a linear theory point of view, such <b>unstable</b> <b>oscillations</b> can consist of a single {{structural}} mode of blades. It {{has been found that}} flutter of real rotor blades can be two-modal: both torsion and bending mode excites simultaneously. As the collective oscillation amplitude increases, the flutter modes become nonlinear for all rotor blades simultaneously. Nevertheless, as usual, an analysis of respective simultaneous time-series is performed by a linear transform. In present paper it is the Independent component analysis (ICA). The linear ICA transform of multi-dimensional time–series under study displays that, as the rotation frequency increases, the rotor blade flutter evolves through four sequential time-phases: linear torsion flutter, nonlinear torsion flutter with bending mode excitation (torsion-bending flutter), linear bending-torsion flutter with a dominating role of bending mode, and nonlinear bending flutter of an unbounded amplitude increase with time.

40|$|A {{new class}} of predictor/corrector {{algorithms}} is proposed to solve the complex system of differential equations that arises from a Galerkin spatial discretization of the equations of motion in a recent formulation of dynamic vehicle/structure interaction. The applicability {{of the concept of}} a building-block vehicle/structure interaction model developed in our previous work-where the vehicle nominal motion is not prescribed a priori, but is part of the unknown motion of the system-is demonstrated through the construction of a simple vehicle model. In the new algorithms, the presence of the accelerations of the vehicle component is eliminated in the predictor structural equations, making these equations different from the corrector structural equations. The special treatment of the predicted axial motion that provides an artificial damping to eliminate <b>unstable</b> <b>oscillations</b> in the numerical results as proposed in the old algorithms is avoided. Accurate results from numerical simulations using the new algorithms are obtained, and there are no <b>unstable</b> <b>oscillations</b> that were observed in some other predictor/corrector schemes.

This work compares the observed rich oscillation spectrum of the rapidly rotating B 3 IV star HD 43317 with the first results obtained by a new method to calculate <b>unstable</b> <b>oscillation</b> modes in rapidly rotating stars {{in order to see}} whether some of the observed modes can be identified.

The complex oscillation frequency used in the forcing is now no longer prescribed, but added as an extra unknown.
