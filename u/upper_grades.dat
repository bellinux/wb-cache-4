40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the study was to {{determine}} if a parenting program would affect the reading achievement scores of single-parent children. Secondary purposes were to determine if male and female students were affected differently and if middle school students were affected differently than elementary students. Ninety-three students from a rural school district in northern Shelby County, Indiana, were identified to participate in the program. Forty-seven experimental children, were instructed in the parenting program twenty-one weeks, twenty-five minutes, two times a week. Forty-seven control students remained in the classroom. Multivariate analysis of covariance was done to test the null hypotheses. The criterion for rejecting or retaining the null hypothesis was set at the. 05 level of probability. Data collected from the pre- and post-test reading scores of the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills, the Piers-Harris Self-Concept Scale, the Martinek-Zaichkowsky Self-Conce t Scale for Children, and the Behavioral Characteristics of Single-Parent Children Checklist were analyzed. Findings were: 1. There was not a significant difference between experimental and control groups or gender;however, the following differences did exist:a. The experimental group scored higher in reading than the control group, with the exception of the lower grade control females, who scored higher than the experimental lower grade females. b. The females of both groups had higher gain scores than the males. 2. There was a significant difference at the. 05 level in reading for the variable grade with lower grade students making larger positive gains than the <b>upper</b> <b>grade</b> students. 3. There were significant differences in self-concept between the control and experimental groups in the area of anxiety, school status, happiness and athletics. a. The lower <b>grade</b> experimental, <b>upper</b> <b>grade</b> control, and male students (of both groups) were less anxious. b. The lower grade students felt better about school and were happier than the <b>upper</b> <b>grade</b> students. c. The second grade control group felt more confident about ability in athletics than the experimental group. 4. The teachers perceived the experimental students as needing less discipline, having higher general achievement and better reading comprehension. Conclusions based on the findings were: 1. The group or the gender did not make a significant difference:a. However, the <b>upper</b> <b>grade</b> experimental group did perform better than the <b>upper</b> <b>grade</b> control group. b. The lower control females performed better than the lower grade experimental females, but the lower grade experimental males out performed the lower grade males in comprehension. 2. The lower grade students performed significantly better than the <b>upper</b> <b>grade</b> students in reading vocabulary and comprehension. 3. The lower grade experimental students, the <b>upper</b> <b>grade</b> control students and the male students were significantly less anxious. 4. The lower grade students felt significantly better about school than the <b>upper</b> <b>grade</b> students. 5.

2500|$|The {{treaty of}} Paris and the Congress of Vienna {{at the end}} of the Napoleonic Wars annexed Belgium to the kingdom of the Netherlands, with Belgian Freemasonry coming under Dutch instead of French influence. [...] Some of its lodges {{disappeared}} with the end of French control, some of which were revived later. [...] The Grand Lodge of the Netherlands (Grand Loge des Pays-Bas) formed at this time, with two administrative Grand Lodges (one for the north, known as Holland, and the other for the south, known as Belgium); the southern one included the [...] "Bonne amitié" [...] lodge of Namur, which was number one on the southern administrative Grand Lodge's tablet. Prince Frédéric d'Orange-Nassau became the overall lodge's Serenest Grand Master and Prince Charles-Alexandre de Gavre, a member of the [...] "Bonne Amitié" [...] lodge of Namur since the mid-1770s, became the southern lodge's official representative. [...] Nevertheless, few records survive on the relations between the two administrative lodges and between the Serenest Grand Master and the various lodges, especially those in Belgium. [...] These relations are illustrated by an episode in 1821 when the Belgian lodges suppressed the <b>upper</b> <b>grades</b> to replace them with a system of two contemporary grades to three top grades ("Élu" [...] and [...] "Maître Élu").|$|E

"Your uncle has had {{something}} {{in the nature of}} a stroke," [...] he said bluntly, and he fixed keen light-coloured eyes on those of Luke, watching the effect which the news--baldly and crudely put--would have on the young man's nerves.

He had had plenty of opportunity of studying those men and women who compose the <b>upper</b> <b>grades</b> of English society. They and their perfect sang-froid, their well-drilled calm under the most dire calamities, or most unexpected blows had often caused him astonishment when he was a younger man, fresh from hospital work, and from the haunts of humbler folk, who had no cause or desire to hide the depth of their feelings. Now he was used to his fashionable patients and had ceased to wonder, and Luke's impassiveness on hearing of his uncle's sudden illness did not necessarily strike him as indifference.|$|E
