40|$|Males {{are usually}} born {{in excess of}} females and the ratio of male births to female births is {{conventionally}} referred to as M/F. Many factors, including stress, privation and natural disasters {{are associated with a}} lowering of M/F. Malta has a North-South divide, with a more affluent North as opposed to a more industrialised and less prosperous South. This study was carried out in order to ascertain whether regional economic differences influenced M/F in Malta. Births by gender, year of birth and locality from 1999 to 2013 were subdivided into ten regions in a geographic distribution devised by the Department of Health Information and Research. Regions were also amalgamated into two groups of five which represented North-West and South-East Malta. The island of Gozo was considered separately. There were no statistically significant differences in M/F between the ten regions nor between North-West, South-East and Gozo regions. There were no significant secular trends in M/F in these regions. M/F declines <b>under</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>factors</b> (including economic stress) but despite the overall poorer economic circumstances in the South of the Island, this study failed to show a significant difference in M/F by region. This may be due at least in part to the relatively small numbers involved. Alternatively, the purported socio-economic differences may not have been sufficiently large so as to skew M/F to statistically significant levels. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Coordinated {{transcriptional}} and metabolic reprogramming ensures a plant's {{continued growth}} and survival <b>under</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>environmental</b> conditions. Transcription <b>factors</b> (TFs) act to modulate gene expression through complex cis-regulatory element (CRE) interactions. Genome-wide analysis of known plant CREs was performed for all currently predicted protein-coding gene promoters in grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.). Many CREs such as abscisic acid (ABA) -responsive, drought-responsive, auxin-responsive, and evening elements, exhibit bona fide CRE properties such as strong position bias towards the transcription start site (TSS) and over-representation when compared with random promoters. Genes containing these CREs are enriched in a large repertoire of plant biological pathways. Large-scale transcriptome analyses also show that these CREs are highly implicated in grapevine development and stress response. Numerous CRE-driven modules in condition-specific gene co-expression networks (GCNs) were identified {{and many of these}} modules were highly enriched for plant biological functions. Several modules corroborate known roles of CREs in drought response, pathogen defense, cell wall metabolism, and fruit ripening, whereas others reveal novel functions in plants. Comparisons with Arabidopsis suggest a general conservation in promoter architecture, gene expression dynamics, and GCN structure across species. Systems analyses of CREs provide insights into the grapevine cis-regulatory code and establish a foundation for future genomic studies in grapevine. © The Author 2017.

In this study, photosynthetic mechanisms and water relationships displayed byJatropha curcasL. (physic nuts) andRicinus communisL.

R. communis showed higher CO 2 assimilation, stomatal and mesophyll conductance thanJ. curcas as light intensity and intercellular CO 2 pressure increased. On the other hand,R. communis was less effective in stomatal control in response to <b>adverse</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>factors</b> such as high temperature, water deficit and vapor pressure deficit, indicating lower water use efficiency. Conversely,J. curcas exhibited higher photosynthetic efficiency (gas exchange and photochemistry) and water use efficiency <b>under</b> these <b>adverse</b> <b>environmental</b> conditions.

During {{the course of a}} typical day, in a semiarid environment, with high irradiation, high temperature and high vapor pressure deficit, but exposed to well-watered conditions, the two studied species presented similar photosynthesis. Losing potential photosynthesis, but maintaining favorable water status and increasing non-photochemical quenching to avoid photoinhibition, are important acclimation mechanisms developed byJ. curcas to cope with dry and hot conditions. We suggest thatJ. curcas is more tolerant to hot and dry environments thanR. communis but the latter species displays higher photosynthetic efficiency under well-watered and non-stressful conditions...|$|R

The effects of these stressors were studied during different stages of early development. The fish developed in ponds for four months after exposure to MFs. The weight, standard length and morphological characteristics of underyearlings which developed from the exposed embryos were recorded. An increase in embryo mortality and a decrease in size-weight indices in underyearlings were noted after fish had been exposed to a combination of magnetic fields and different <b>adverse</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>factors.</b> In addition, exposure to magnetic fields led to changes in the total number of vertebrae and in the number of seismosensory system openings in the mandibular bones of underyearlings.
