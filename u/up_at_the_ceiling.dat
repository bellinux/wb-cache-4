500|$|In the HIStory album booklet {{there is}} an image of Gottfried Helnwein's 1981 {{watercolor}} [...] "Das Lied / The Song" [...] which is {{an image of a}} distressed child huddled in the corner of a room, screaming <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Jackson's handwritten lyrics to [...] "Scream" [...] were scrawled on the wall beside the child. Towards the end of the booklet is a copy of a child's letter to the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, asking him to end war, pollution, and to stop the negative press reports about Jackson.|$|E
60|$|He {{moved his}} feet uneasily {{on the marble}} hearth, and put his {{cigarette}} to his mouth, looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "Are you {{game for}} five shillings?" [...] inquired the landlord, rubbing his stubby double chin and looking <b>up</b> thoughtfully <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> above him.|$|R

6000|$|... "What is it, me boy?" [...] {{the major}} asked, with languid curiosity, puffing at his weed and staring <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> smoke-blackened <b>ceiling.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Scarcely human, in fact," [...] Decoud commented {{under his}} breath, {{his head at}} rest against the wall, his eyes gazing <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{professor}} looked quickly <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> We saw {{the blue}} sky through a hole {{the size of an}} orange nearly above Don Rafael's chair.|$|E
6000|$|Aunt Dorcas looked {{straight}} <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> {{for as many}} as two minutes, and then said, abruptly, as if having decided upon some course of action: ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. George is mightily curious {{in respect}} of the room. He looks <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> painted <b>ceiling,</b> looks round <b>at</b> <b>the</b> old law-books, contemplates the portraits of the great clients, reads aloud {{the names on the}} boxes.|$|R
60|$|He looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pantry <b>ceiling,</b> {{which was}} shaking with the {{stamping}} and shuffling of {{feet on the}} floor above, listened for a moment to the piano and then glanced <b>at</b> <b>the</b> girl, who was folding his overcoat carefully <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of a shelf.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Gallilee {{was leaning}} back in her chair: her hands hung down {{on either side of}} her; her eyes looked <b>up</b> drowsily <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Prepared to see a person with an {{overburdened}} mind, the maid (without sympathy, to quicken her perceptions) saw nothing but a person on the point of taking a nap.|$|R
6000|$|HE, sinking {{mechanically}} {{into the}} chair she indicates: [...] "Oh, just as you like!" [...] He looks <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> in hopeless bewilderment, while she writes.|$|E
60|$|He got off {{my table}} and, looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> cocked his beard a little awry; {{at the same}} time making it stick out before him.|$|E
60|$|On {{the third}} night, the ghost reappeared, quite unabashed, {{and for a}} third time made for the kitchen. Arrived there, it looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> and vanished.|$|E
50|$|Introduced {{earlier in}} the series, he is a soldier from Sou Beil. He died trying to thwart Allison, Wil, and Carr Benedict from {{revealing}} the mural. His death {{was caused by the}} injury Wil inflicted on his shoulder; he ended shooting <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cave's <b>ceiling</b> and being crushed by the rocks that fell. His daughter is Ann.|$|R
60|$|He backed slowly {{towards the}} door, {{with his eyes}} fixed on them. I stood by and waited. Inch by inch he retreated. Lady Georgina looked down abstractedly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> carpet. Mrs. Evelegh looked <b>up</b> abstractedly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Neither spoke another word. The rogue backed out by degrees. Then he sprang downstairs, and before they could decide was well out into the open.|$|R
60|$|As {{he passed}} from the dressing-room a few minutes later, Brooks {{paused for a moment}} to look <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{wonderful}} <b>ceiling</b> above <b>the</b> hall. Below, Lord Arranmore was idly knocking about the billiard balls, and all around him was the murmur of pleasant conversation. Brooks drew the envelope from his pocket and glanced <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cheque. He gave a little gasp of astonishment. It was for a thousand pounds.|$|R
60|$|Poor Pinch {{looked down}} uneasily at Mr Pecksniff, whose eye was fixed upon him {{as it had}} been from the first; and looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> again, made no reply.|$|E
60|$|Pierson raised himself, {{and moved}} {{back from the}} bed. Her words confounded him, yet {{he was afraid to}} answer. She pushed her head deep into the pillow, and lay looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Septimus Hicks looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> {{and down}} at the floor; at last an idea struck him. ‘Let {{the man of the}} house, Tibbs, be the father,’ he suggested; and then he quoted, as peculiarly {{applicable}} to Tibbs and the pair— ...|$|E
50|$|An {{interactive}} {{exhibit is}} located on the lower level of the museum below <b>the</b> pergola <b>ceiling</b> where <b>the</b> tower rests. Visitors can sit on circular, rotating benches in order to look <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pergola <b>ceiling</b> and observe <b>the</b> colours, shapes, and the light interacting with the glass. The exhibit includes hands-on elements that allow visitors to build towers using plastic pieces of coloured shapes. Computer kiosks walk the user through the glassblowing process.|$|R
60|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> name Pico started, {{and there}} was a {{movement}} as of fear from the three grooms who followed him. The Count looked down at that splendid, blood-spattered figure lying there so still, its sightless eyes staring <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> frescoed <b>ceiling,</b> so brave and so pitiful in his gold-broidered suit of white satin, with the richly jewelled girdle carrying gloves and purse and a jewelled dagger that had been so useless in that extremity.|$|R
6000|$|... "At any rate," [...] he said, [...] "you won't {{have any}} trouble {{settling}} up—no debts or anything of that. I believe there's a bit to leave—so it's not so bad. Poor devil—he was very down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> last; {{but we have to}} pay at one end or the other. What on earth is the old girl after?" [...] he asked, looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> raftered <b>ceiling,</b> which was rumbling and thundering with the old lady's violent rummaging.|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess I {{took the}} cold that day, from havin' the window open," [...] she concluded; and she passed her hand across her lap, {{and looked down}} demurely, and then <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> and her head twitched a little and trembled.|$|E
6000|$|... "Though unsatisfactory, my {{research}} {{has not been}} entirely barren," [...] he observed, staring <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> with dreamy, lack-lustre eyes. [...] "Subject to your correction, I should judge that the watch belonged to your elder brother, who inherited it from your father." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is 'er," [...] ses Bill, {{stroking}} his long white beard and casting 'is eyes <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> [...] "You don't remember me, Mrs. Pearce, but I {{used to see}} you years ago, when you and poor Charlie Pearce was living down Poplar way." ...|$|E
6000|$|Madame de Bellegarde did {{not move}} in her place, but she was as pale as her daughter. The marquis looked down at her. She said nothing for some moments, but she kept her keen, clear eyes upon Newman, bravely. The marquis drew himself <b>up</b> and looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> [...] "It's impossible!" [...] he said softly.|$|R
60|$|He went {{straight}} to Roderick's apartment, deeming this, at an early hour, the safest place to seek him. He found him in his sitting-room, which had been closely darkened {{to keep out the}} heat. The carpets and rugs had been removed, the floor of speckled concrete was bare and lightly sprinkled with water. Here and there, over it, certain strongly perfumed flowers had been scattered. Roderick was lying on his divan in a white dressing-gown, staring <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> frescoed <b>ceiling.</b> <b>The</b> room was deliciously cool, and filled with the moist, sweet odor of the circumjacent roses and violets. All this seemed highly fantastic, and yet Rowland hardly felt surprised.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, ay," [...] said <b>the</b> coachman, looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of {{the page}} immediately. [...] "His last Will and Testament. Hech, sirs! there's a sair confronting of Death in a Doecument like yon! A' flesh is grass," [...] {{continued}} the coachman, exhaling an additional puff of whisky, and looking <b>up</b> devoutly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> [...] "Tak' those words in connection with that other Screepture: Many are ca'ad, but few are chosen. Tak' that again, in connection with Rev'lations, Chapter the First, verses One to Fefteen. Lay the whole to heart; and what's your Walth, then? Dross, sirs! And your body? (Screepture again.) Clay for the potter! And your life? (Screepture once more.) The Breeth o' your Nostrils!" ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs Foster did not {{ask this}} of Amy; no, she gazed <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> where an uncommonly large spider was {{affixing}} its web,--with the design, no doubt, of lowering itself down to the tea-table,--and demanded {{the solution of the}} problem, apparently, from that creature.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Right again, quite right,' said Mr Swiveller, '{{caution is}} the word, and caution is the act.' with that, he winked {{as if in}} {{preservation}} of some deep secret, and folding his arms and {{leaning back in his}} chair, looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> with profound gravity.|$|E
60|$|As {{the black}} straw hat made no reply, the captain looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> but not meeting with any {{response}} from that quarter, {{he looked out}} at the window and encountered the gaze of a seaman flattening his nose on a pane of glass, and looking in.|$|E
50|$|The novel {{starts off}} with Daisuke, the protagonist, waking <b>up</b> and staring <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> {{with his hand}} on his heart, feeling for his heartbeat. He is a son of a wealthy family. He is a {{polyglot}} and well-read, and has graduated from a prestigious university. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time in Japan, universities were a new element in society and the government had to hire Western professors in order to teach students. But despite graduating, he is now thirty years old and unemployed, and depends on his father's wealth.|$|R
6000|$|While this {{reflection}} {{was passing}} through my mind, Miss Jillgall came in--saw the nosegay on the table--and instantly pounced on it. [...] "Oh, for me! for me!" [...] she cried. [...] "I noticed {{it this morning}} on Elizabeth's table. How very kind of her!" [...] She plunged her inquisitive nose into the poor flowers, and looked <b>up</b> sentimentally <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> [...] "The perfume of goodness," [...] she remarked, [...] "mingled with the perfume of flowers!" [...] "When you have quite done with it," [...] I said, [...] "perhaps you will be so good as to return my nosegay?" [...] "Your nosegay!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "There is Mrs. Tenbruggen's letter," [...] I replied, [...] "if {{you would like to}} look at it." [...] She did look <b>at</b> it. All <b>the</b> bile in her body flew up into her eyes, and turned them green; {{she looked as if she}} longed to scratch my face. I gave the flowers afterward to Maria; Miss Jillgall's nose had completely spoiled them.|$|R
60|$|All {{these details}} I {{observed}} afterwards. At present my attention was centred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon the boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> discoloured <b>ceiling.</b> It {{was that of}} a man about forty-three or forty-four years of age, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and a short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar and cuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor beside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while his lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been a grievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror, and as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human features. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low forehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly simious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his writhing, unnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never has it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy apartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban London.|$|R
