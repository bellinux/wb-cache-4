2500|$|One {{variant of}} selling short {{involves}} a long position. [...] "Selling short against the box" [...] consists of holding a long position {{on which the}} shares have already risen, whereupon one then enters a short sell order for {{an equal number of}} shares. The term box alludes to the days when a safe deposit box was used to store (long) shares. [...] The purpose of this technique is to lock in paper profits on the long position without having to sell that position (and possibly incur taxes if said position has appreciated). Once the short position has been entered, it serves to balance the long position taken earlier. Thus, from that point in time, the profit is locked in (less brokerage fees and short financing costs), regardless of further fluctuations in the <b>underlying</b> <b>share</b> price. For example, one can ensure a profit in this way, while delaying sale until the subsequent tax year.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a structural valuation model for exchangeable convertible bonds, since such bonds are widespread by now. The model is solved through the Hopscotch finite difference method. As the issuer owns the <b>underlying</b> <b>shares,</b> exchangeable convertibles {{may be called}} and the exchange option may be exercised even as the issuer experiences financial distress. The value of exchangeable convertibles always decreases in the volatility of the issuer's assets (unlike the value of ordinary convertibles) and decreases in {{the correlation between the}} <b>underlying</b> <b>shares</b> and the issuer's assets. The analysis confirms that the dominant motive for issuing exchangeable convertibles is likely to be to dispose of the <b>underlying</b> <b>shares.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|Vega is {{typically}} expressed {{as the amount}} of money per <b>underlying</b> <b>share</b> that the option's value will gain or lose as volatility rises or falls by 1%. All options (both calls and puts) will gain value with rising volatility.|$|E
50|$|The <b>underlying</b> <b>share</b> {{universe}} includes approximately 230 equity issues. For a company's {{shares to}} be included, the company must be domiciled in Switzerland and the shares {{must have a}} free float {{equal to or greater}} than 20%.

(The extent of the co-relation is {{sometimes referred to as}} a delta, and these typically have a delta of between 0.5 and 1)In addition, some of these securities include minimum and maximum conversion terms, effectively giving the holder a put and call option if the share price reaches a certain prices.|$|E
25|$|Tax advantages. The {{market for}} {{convertibles}} is primarily pitched towards the non taxpaying investor. The price will substantially reflect (1) {{the value of}} the <b>underlying</b> <b>shares,</b> (2) the discounted gross income advantage of the convertible over the <b>underlying</b> <b>shares,</b> plus (3) some figure for the embedded optionality of the bond. The tax advantage is greatest with mandatory convertibles. Effectively a high tax-paying shareholder can benefit from the company securitising gross future income on the convertible, income which it can offset against taxable profits.|$|R
40|$|We examine {{voluntary}} disclosures {{around the}} exercise of CEO stock options. Previous research shows that managerial incentives depend on the intended disposition of the exercised options' <b>underlying</b> <b>shares.</b> When CEOs intend to sell the <b>underlying</b> <b>shares</b> of exercised options, they {{have an incentive to}} increase stock prices in the pre-exercise period. In contrast, when CEOs intend to hold the <b>underlying</b> <b>shares,</b> they have a tax incentive to decrease stock prices in the pre-exercise period. Consistent with these private incentives, we find {{a significant increase in the}} frequency and magnitude of good (bad) news announcements in the pre-exercise period when CEOs implement exercise-and-sell (exercise-and-hold) strategies. We provide some evidence that CEOs' propensities for opportunistic disclosures are positively related to the value of their exercised stock options. Lastly, we find that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) generally reduces, but does not eliminate, this type of managerial opportunism.

50|$|An equity swap, like {{an equity}} index swap, is an {{agreement}} between two parties to swap two sets of cash flows. In this case the cash flows will be the price of an underlying stock value swapped, for instance, with LIBOR. A typical example {{of this type of}} derivative is the Contract for difference (CFD) where one party gains exposure to a share price without buying or selling the <b>underlying</b> <b>share</b> making it relatively cost efficient as well as making it relatively easy to transact.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a valuation {{model for a}} perpetual convertible bond when the price dynamics of the <b>underlying</b> <b>share</b> are governed by continuous-time Markovian regime-switching models. We suppose that the appreciation rate and the volatility of the <b>underlying</b> <b>share</b> are modulated by a continuous-time, finite-state, observable Markov chain. The states of this chain are interpreted as the states of an economy. Here the valuation problem of the perpetual convertible bond {{can be viewed as}} that of valuing a perpetual stock loan, or a perpetual American option with time-dependent strike price. With the presence of the regime-switching effect, the market in the model is, in general, incomplete. To provide a convenient method to determine a price kernel for valuation, we employ the regime-switching Esscher transform introduced in Elliott, Chan and Siu (2005) [4]. We then adopt the differential equation approach in Guo and Zhang (2004) [7] to solve the optimal stopping problem associated with the valuation of the perpetual convertible bond. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the practical implementation of the proposed model. Â© 2009 Academic Publications. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Long-run {{convergence}} {{evidenced by}} cointegration {{suggests that if}} price movement of ADR and the <b>underlying</b> <b>share</b> diverges, market forces will act to eliminate the gap. The dynamics of the ADR portfolios can well {{be influenced by the}} deviation from the long-run relationship, or specifically, the error terms in the cointegration equation. Therefore, we examine the long run relationship of stock price between ADRs and their respective underlying securities particularly in emerging markets, especially those countries experience the financial crisis in this decade. We employ the EC terms as proxies for the amount of information generated by individual equity markets and add dummy variables to capture the effect of financial crisis and exchange rate volatility to the long-run equilibrium relationship between ADRs market and underlying stocks market. Resolving the value discrepancies by adjustment in prices of foreign equities become stronger during the financial crisis period, however, become weaker by adjustment in prices of ADRs. The results also demonstrate that high exchange rate volatility will improve the market forces to eliminate the gap of same-day price movement of ADR and the <b>underlying</b> <b>share</b> diverges by adjustment in prices of foreign equities. On the contrary, low exchange rate volatility will improve the market forces to eliminate the gap of one-day lag price movement of ADR and the <b>underlying</b> <b>share</b> diverges by adjustment in prices of ADRs. 1.
