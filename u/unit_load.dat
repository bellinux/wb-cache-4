5|$|A bus-powered hub is a {{high-power}} device providing low-power ports. It draws 1 <b>unit</b> <b>load</b> for the hub controller and 1 <b>unit</b> <b>load</b> {{for each}} of at most 4 ports. The hub may also have some non-removable functions in place of ports. A self-powered hub is a device that provides high-power ports. Optionally, the hub controller draw power for its operation as a low-power device, but all high-power ports draw from the hub's self-power.|$|E
5|$|There {{are limits}} on the power a device may draw, {{stated in terms of}} a <b>unit</b> <b>load,</b> which is 100mA or 150mA for SuperSpeed devices. There are {{low-power}} and high-power devices. Low-power devices may draw at most 1 <b>unit</b> <b>load,</b> and all devices must act as low-power devices when starting out as unconfigured. High-power devices draw at least 1 <b>unit</b> <b>load</b> and at most 5 unit loads (500mA) or 6 unit loads (900mA) for SuperSpeed devices. A high-powered device must be configured, and may only draw as much power as specified in its configuration. I.e., the maximum power may not be available.|$|E
25|$|Tertiary or transit {{packaging}} is {{used for}} bulk handling, warehouse storage and transport shipping. The most common form is a palletized <b>unit</b> <b>load</b> that packs tightly into containers.|$|E
40|$|The <b>unit</b> <b>loads,</b> e. g., plastic {{containers}} or EUR-pallets, {{used in an}} assembly plant can {{have a significant impact}} on time efficiency, and hence cost, of both the materials supply and the receiving assembly stations. Smaller <b>unit</b> <b>loads</b> can reduce the time the assemblers spend fetching parts. However, larger <b>unit</b> <b>loads</b> result in fewer moves for a given volume of materials, which implies efficient in-plant materials supply. The current paper explores how the time efficiency of in-plant materials supply is affected by the size of <b>unit</b> <b>loads.</b> Based on the case study, it is clear that the efficiency of the in-plant materials supply is not proportional to the size of the <b>unit</b> <b>loads.</b> There are fundamental differences between how large pallets, compared to smaller <b>unit</b> <b>loads,</b> are delivered, meaning that the increased delivery frequency required for smaller <b>unit</b> <b>loads</b> does not necessarily result in an increased man-hour consumption...|$|R
50|$|<b>Unit</b> <b>loads</b> move by an {{unpredictable}} mix of {{many types of}} vehicles and storage areas, the exact set is difficult to predict. Therefore, <b>unit</b> <b>loads</b> must be designed to travel by any such vehicles, and be stored {{in a wide variety}} of places. There are therefore many similarities in the requirements for long term storage and long distance transportation of <b>unit</b> <b>loads.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} a device for the palletization and/or sorting of <b>unit</b> <b>loads</b> of different sizes, presented in any sequence and in any mixture ratio, into transportation and/or storage units, said device consisting of an intermediate store, in which the <b>unit</b> <b>loads</b> can be buffered before palletization, a detection system which detects the shape {{and size of the}} individual <b>unit</b> <b>loads,</b> and a multi-axis handling and positioning unit which grabs the <b>unit</b> <b>loads</b> stored in the intermediate store and deposits them on the transportation and storage unit at a location specified by an evaluation and control unit. The invention is characterized {{by the fact that the}} intermediate store is a conveyor belt, which is movable in two directions and on which individual <b>unit</b> <b>loads</b> can be arranged in at least one row in any sequence without any fixed position allocation, that the evaluation and control unit also detects the precise location of the <b>unit</b> <b>loads</b> on the conveyor belt and the conveyor belt moves in such a way that the <b>unit</b> <b>loads</b> can be removed from the conveyor belt at specified points in free access...|$|R
25|$|A <b>unit</b> <b>load</b> device (ULD) is a pallet or {{container}} used to load luggage, freight, {{and mail}} on wide-body aircraft and specific narrow-body aircraft. It allows a large quantity of cargo to be bundled {{into a single}} unit. Since this leads to fewer units to load, it saves ground crews time and effort and helps prevent delayed flights. Each ULD has its own packing list (or manifest) so that its contents can be tracked.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, {{there were}} about 20.5million {{intermodal}} containers {{in the world of}} varying types to suit different cargoes. Containers have largely supplanted the traditional break bulk cargo – in 2010 containers accounted for 60% of the world's seaborne trade. The predominant alternative methods of transport carry bulk cargo – whether gaseous, liquid or solid – e.g. by bulk carrier or tank ship, tank car or truck. For air freight, the more light-weight IATA-defined <b>unit</b> <b>load</b> device is used.|$|E
25|$|The 747-400F has a {{main deck}} nose {{door and a}} {{mechanized}} cargo handling system. The nose door swings up so that pallets or containers up to 40ft (12 m) can be loaded straight in on motor-driven rollers. An optional main deck side cargo door (like the 747-400M (Combi)) allows loading of dimensionally taller cargo modules. A lower deck ("belly") side door allows loading of <b>unit</b> <b>load</b> devices (ULD) up to 163cm in height. Boeing delivered 126 Boeing 747-400F aircraft with no unfilled orders as of November 2009. The last −400F was delivered to Nippon Cargo Airlines on August 2, 2008.|$|E

Using a conventional tail design also allowed the rear fuselage to be tapered over a shorter section, providing for parallel aisles along {{the full length of}} the passenger cabin, and eliminating irregular seat rows toward the rear of the aircraft.|$|E

50|$|Another {{standard}} for <b>unit</b> <b>loads</b> is MIL-STD-1660, a {{standard for}} ammunition <b>unit</b> <b>loads.</b> DOD <b>unit</b> <b>loads</b> generally use 40 x 48 in pallets, which unfortunately do not pack efficiently into ISO containers. They weigh less than 4000 lb to limit the stresses on handling equipment. They are weatherproof, and stack 16 ft high. They often use steel pallets, steel straps with notched seals, outdoor plywood, and plastic film. MIL-STD-1660 mandates that loads must never be less than {{the width of a}} pallet, while permitting some overhang. The markings are LOGMARS bar codes and standard inventory numbers. The standard describes major parts of the logistic path, including storage, ship, air, truck, forklift and sling (i.e. ship-to-ship and parachute). There are auxiliary standards for ship-to-ship transfers, and amphibious transfers.
