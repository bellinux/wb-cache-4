25|$|One of the para-Alpine skiing {{techniques}} used by this class {{is called the}} three track method, and was developed {{as part of the}} American Training System. One of the first skills learned using this technique is how to walk with the ski so the skier can learn how to flex the ankle, knee and hip. This allows the skier to determine their centre of gravity. The skier is then taught how hop turn in order to understand arm and leg coordination while on skis. This technique is only used while stationary and is not a competition skill. The skier next learns how to fall down and get back up again. The next skill learned is climbing gentle terrain, followed by learning to go down a straight run and learning to stop. After this, the skier learns how to get on and off a ski lift. This is followed by learning how to traverse the fall line, which teaches the skier how to maintain the ski edge. Other skills are then taught including the <b>Uphill</b> <b>Christie,</b> beginning turns, parallel turns, short swings and moguls.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to reveal the characteristics of la terality in skiing. 	The questionnaire survey of 32 items of daily movements， 27 exercise movements except 	for skiing movements and 16 skiing movements was analyzed. The subject's 	skiing technique was in the third class of the badge test by S. A. J. and the following 	results were obtained. 	 1. Twenty-three factors were extracted by principal component analysis with normal 	varimax rotation from 75 items. The first factor which is that the outside foot of 	turning in skiing has 10 items was related to skiing movements. Exactly， it shows 	that regardless of the. <b>uphill</b> and downhill <b>christie</b> of the snow plow， the parallel 	and the jump christie， all subjects have a fixed dominant on the outside foot of 	turning. 	 2. The laterality in skiing does not exist in the same factor of the crossing foot， 	the take off foot， the step forward foot and the dominant trunk turning factors. 	Therefore， it seems that the laterality in skiing does not relate to the daily movements 	and exercise movements except for skiing movements. 	 3. It seems that the traverse is similar to the sideslipping， because both techniques 	have the same facto...|$|R
