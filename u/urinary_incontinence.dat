5|$|Alterations in the {{autonomic}} {{nervous system}} can lead to orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing), oily skin and excessive sweating, <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> and altered sexual function. Constipation and impaired stomach emptying (gastric dysmotility) can be severe enough to cause discomfort and even endanger health. Changes in perception may include an impaired sense of smell, disturbed vision, pain, and paresthesia (tingling and numbness). All of these symptoms can occur years before diagnosis of the disease.|$|E
5|$|Behavioural and neuropsychiatric changes {{become more}} prevalent. Common manifestations are wandering, {{irritability}} and labile affect, leading to crying, outbursts of unpremeditated aggression, or resistance to caregiving. Sundowning can also appear. Approximately 30% {{of people with}} AD develop illusionary misidentifications and other delusional symptoms. Subjects also lose insight of their disease process and limitations (anosognosia). <b>Urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> can develop. These symptoms create stress for relatives and carers, which can be reduced by moving the person from home care to other long-term care facilities.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Both {{pregnancy}} and childbirth are important {{risk factors for}} <b>urinary</b> stress <b>incontinence</b> in women. For its prevention, exercies of the pelvic floor musculature {{have been shown to}} be effective. Guidelines for <b>urinary</b> stress <b>incontinence</b> management recommend offering pelvic floor muscle training to women during their first pregnancy as a preventive measure. Objective: To update the information provided in the scientific literature on <b>urinary</b> stress <b>incontinence</b> during postpartum and possible forms of treat it. Methodology: A systematic bibliographic review was carried out in the following databases: PUBMED, COCHRANE, CINHAL, MEDLINE, SciELO and SCOPUS. The date was restricted to the last 5 years (2012 - 2017), in Spanish, English and Portuguese. Restrictions were made regarding the type of study, and Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) were considered for this review. Results: After reviewing the literature consulted, it is concluded that the training of the pelvic floor musculature is beneficial to prevent the occurrence of <b>urinary</b> stress <b>incontinence</b> during {{pregnancy and}} the postpartum period. Conclusions: The results obtained in this review are consistent with previous studies and bibliographic reviews of the same topic. It follows that training of the pelvic floor muscles is beneficial in preventing the occurrence of <b>urinary</b> stress <b>incontinence</b> during pregnancy or postpartum. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{injuries}} {{at or above}} the lumbar or sacral regions of the spinal cord (lower back and pelvis) include decreased control of the legs and hips, genitourinary system, and anus. People injured below level L2 may still have use of their hip flexor and knee extensor muscles. Bowel and bladder function are regulated by the sacral region. It is common to experience sexual dysfunction after injury, as well as dysfunction of the bowel and bladder, including fecal and <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> It is also possible for the bladder to fail to empty, leading to a potentially harmful buildup of urine. One sign of spinal cord injury that emergency providers may find is priapism, an erection of the penis.|$|E
5|$|Hydrocephalus is an {{abnormal}} accumulation of CSF in the ventricles of the brain. Hydrocephalus can occur because {{of obstruction of}} the passage of CSF, such as from an infection, injury, mass, or congenital abnormality. Hydrocephalus without obstruction associated with normal CSF pressure may also occur. Symptoms can include problems with gait and coordination, <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> nausea and vomiting, and progressively impaired thinking. In infants, hydrocephalus can cause an enlarged head, as {{the bones of the}} skull have not yet fused, seizures, irritability and drowsiness. A CT scan or MRI scan may reveal enlargement of one or both lateral ventricles, or causative masses or lesions, and lumbar puncture may be used to demonstrate and in some circumstances relieve high intracranial pressure. Hydrocephalus is usually treated through the insertion of a shunt, which diverts fluid {{to another part of the}} body, such as a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt.|$|E

3000|$|Introduction: The {{principle}} of abdominal colposuspension, first initiated in 1961, {{has been used}} for many years as [...] "gold standard" [...] technique in the treatment of the <b>urinary</b> stress <b>incontinence.</b> The laparoscopic colposuspension, first reported in 1991, was accepted in the medical world due to its lower postoperative morbidity and shorter hospital stay.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{compare the}} results of {{modified}} MMK operation with vaginal repair in female stress incontinence and to study the prognostic variables that determine the success. MATERIALS AND METHODS: <b>Urinary</b> stress <b>incontinence</b> was treated by modified MMK operation in 59 and by Kelly’s vaginal repair in 42 women. All were assessed preoperatively by detailed history, clinical examination. No sophisticated urodynamic studies were done. Follow up was done initially at 3 months, then at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: Better results were obtained with modified MMK operation (88. 1 %) compared to vaginal repair (69 %). Results were excellent in type I incontinence {{and in the absence}} of pelvic floor relaxation. Hysterectomy did not seem to improve the results. Complication rates were acceptable with modified MMK operation. CONCLUSION: Though laparoscopic Burch colposuspension is the preferred management in female <b>urinary</b> stress <b>incontinence,</b> this modality is not available at all centers. For institutions which provide basic gynaecological services, we recommend modified MMK operation as a primary surgery for female <b>urinary</b> stress <b>incontinence</b> to obtain higher cure rates and to minimize the incidence of recurrent <b>urinary</b> stress <b>incontinence</b> following vaginal repair.

25|$|<b>Urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> and vaginal {{prolapse}} {{are well}} known adverse effects that develop with high frequency {{a very long time}} after the surgery. Typically, those complications develop 10–20 years after the surgery. For this reason exact numbers are not known, and risk factors are poorly understood. It is also unknown if the choice of surgical technique has any effect. It has been assessed that the risk for <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> is approximately doubled within 20 years after hysterectomy. One long-term study found a 2.4 fold increased risk for surgery to correct urinary stress incontinence following hysterectomy.|$|E
