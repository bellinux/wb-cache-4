Also, a Greek astronomer, Andronicus of Cyrrhus, supervised the construction of his Horologion, known today as the Tower of the Winds, in the Athens marketplace (or agora) {{in the first half}} of the 1st century BCE.

50|$|While it {{is quite}} well known on campus, the Iron Ring Clock is not always {{recognized}} as a clock. The most common criticism of the clock {{is that it is}} counterintuitive to read. (It must be read straight on, with the number on the top ring denoting the hour and the number on the bottom ring denoting the minute. If there is no number directly under the <b>hour</b> <b>indicator,</b> the minute must be inferred from the nearest two numbers.) As the rings move slowly, the clock has been mistaken for a static display. It has shown the wrong time in the past, due to events such as power outages or breakdowns; in 2006/2007, the clock stopped for three months due to motor bearing failure. In 2007, an uninterruptible power supply was installed to eliminate the problem with power outages. However, in the absence of such events the motor and mechanism have shown themselves to be quite accurate.|$|R

40|$|Objective: Develop {{performance}} indicators reflecting {{the quality of}} trauma-patient-care {{in the emergency room}} and hospitalization within the first 48 hours. Material and Method: A two-round Delphi technique was conducted. A panel of 11 expert surgeons experienced in the fields of trauma care was consulted. The panel was initially asked to rate {{performance indicators}} that reflected the quality of trauma care given in the emergency department setting and hospitalization in the first 48 hours using a 5 -point on visual analogue scale. The statement of indicators that was collected from the first round was analyzed and necessary changes were before resending to the same experts. Each indicator statement was considered consensus if the expert’s opinion rating was 4 or 5 for more than 70 % (8 out of 11 experts). Results: Fifty-three performance indicators were proposed in four domains of trauma care in emergency room and four domains of trauma care in hospitalization within 48 <b>hours.</b> Altogether 35 <b>indicators</b> reached consensus reflecting quality of trauma performance after two rounds. Twenty-one of these were trauma care indicators in emergency room and 14 were trauma care indicators in hospitalization within 48 <b>hours.</b> Conclusion: Twenty-one <b>indicators</b> of quality of trauma care in the emergency room and 14 in the hospitalization within 48 hours have been developed.

Introduction: The following tests were made on the {{compressed air}} plant in the Engineering Laboratory of the Kansas State Agricultural College.

A Westinghouse engine with two 6 x 8 single acting cylinders {{was connected to the}} air receiver and used as an air motor. The object of the tests was to determine 1 st the efficiency of the plant, or the ratio of the developed brake horse power of the motor to the indicated horse power of the engine; 2 nd the efficiency between the engine and compressor cylinders, and between the compressor cylinder and the brake on the motor; 2 rd the horse power lost in heating the air and the cooling water.

40|$|A {{transformation}} {{of what had}} become a <b>universal</b> 40 <b>hour</b> standard work week in Germany began in 1985 with reductions negotiated in the metal-working and printing sectors. These reductions have continued through 1995, and were followed by reductions in other sectors. The union campaign aimed to increase employment through work-sharing, and is being emulated in the United States with the launch of a reduced hours campaign by the AFL-CIO. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, I find that increased overtime or reduced short time was little used to offset the reduction in standard hours: a one hour reduction in standard hours appears to have translated into a reduction in actual hours worked of between 0. 85 and 1 hour for workers in manufacturing. One might expect this to {{have resulted in a}} loss of earnings for workers in affected industries. However, I substantiate the union claim of full wage compensation : reductions in standard hours were accompanied by a relative rise in the hourly straight-time wage of 2 - 3 % for each hour fall in standard hours, enough to keep monthly earnings the same as in unaffected industries. ...|$|R
