The {{part in the}} snippet was from the, [...] "Love me, love me, please retweet. Let me be the girl <b>under</b> <b>you</b> that makes you cry," [...] line. Interscope Records later {{uploaded}} the track [...] "Gypsy" [...] on their SoundCloud account as list of singles they would send for radio play. This led to speculation in the media that [...] "Gypsy" [...] would be released as the third single from Artpop. Gaga also announced plans of shooting a new music video, which tied in with the single rumors. In March 2014, NBC announced that the next Artpop single would be [...] "G.U.Y." [...] {{and that they would}} premiere its music video on March 22. It officially impacted mainstream and rhythmic radio stations in the US on April 8, 2014, according to All Access Music Group. A radio edit was uploaded to Interscope's SoundCloud; the edit has 20 seconds of the introduction chopped off. Universal Music announced that in Italy, the song would be played from March 28, 2014, while BBC Radio 1 declared [...] "G.U.Y." [...] as new music on UK radio from April 21, 2014.|$|E

2500|$|Harold Holt {{disappeared}} while swimming on 17 December 1967 and {{was declared}} presumed drowned two days later. His presumed successor was Liberal deputy leader William McMahon. [...] However, on 18 December, the Country Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister John McEwen announced that if McMahon were named the new Liberal leader, {{he and his}} party would not serve under him. [...] His reasons were never stated publicly, but in a private meeting with McMahon, he said [...] "I will not serve <b>under</b> <b>you</b> because I do not trust you". McEwen's shock declaration triggered a leadership crisis within the Liberal Party; even more significantly, it raised {{the threat of a}} possible breaking of the Coalition, which would spell electoral disaster for the Liberals. [...] Up to that time, the Liberals had never won enough seats in any House of Representatives election to be able to govern without Country Party support. [...] Indeed, since the Coalition's formation in 1923, the major non-Labor party had only been able to govern alone once, during Joseph Lyons' first ministry—and even then, Lyons' United Australia Party had come up four seats short of a majority and needed confidence and supply support from the Country Party to govern.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Wei Shu, Guo Jia advised Cao Cao on how {{to handle}} Liu Bei when Liu Bei came to join Cao Cao in 196, after Lü Bu seized control of Xu Province from Liu's general Zhang Fei. On Cao Cao's suggestion, Emperor Xian {{appointed}} Liu Bei as the Governor (牧) of Yu Province (豫州). Someone told Cao Cao, [...] "Liu Bei has the ambition of a hero. If you don't eliminate him now, he'll become a threat to you in the future." [...] Cao Cao asked Guo Jia for his opinion, to which Guo replied, [...] "That's true. However, when you raised an army in the name of righteousness and pledged to help the common people eliminate tyrants, you attracted talented and capable people to serve <b>under</b> <b>you</b> based on your sincerity and integrity. Liu Bei is known to be a hero, so if you kill him when he comes to serve you, you will be viewed as someone who harms men of virtue. Other talented persons will start to doubt you and may even change their minds about serving you. If that happens, who will help you achieve your goals? Therefore, it's imperative that you carefully consider the consequences of ruining your good reputation for the sake of eliminating one man who poses a threat to you." [...] Cao Cao laughed and said, [...] "I understand." ...|$|E

[...] Later, when Sun Quan and his officers were celebrating the victory, Gan Ning left his seat and knelt down before his lord. He kowtowed until his face was covered in blood and with tears in his eyes, he pleaded with Sun Quan, [...] "I owe Su Fei a favour. If not for him, I'd have been dead and my body abandoned in a ravine. I'd {{not have been able}} to serve <b>under</b> <b>you.</b> Now, even though Su Fei's actions warrant death, I still hope you can spare him." [...] Sun Quan was moved and he asked, [...] "What if he leaves after I spare his life?" [...] Gan Ning replied, [...] "Su Fei will be grateful if he is spared from death. He'll not leave even if you try to chase him away. Why would he still seek his own doom? If he really does that, I'm willing to use my head to replace his in the box." [...] Sun Quan then pardoned Su Fei.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the federalist}} forces in open disarray and the polls {{showing that the}} yes side was going to win, Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin {{suggested}} organizing a gigantic [...] "unity rally" [...] in Montreal. Most of the Cabinet was opposed to Tobin's idea, but Chrétien decided to support the rally, telling Tobin at the Cabinet meeting [...] "Brian-Go!" [...] Chrétien's chief of staff Jean Pelletier later recalled that [...] "We muscled in" [...] on leading the no forces as Johnson, the nominal leader of the no committee {{was considered to be}} an inept leader who would lose the referendum on his own. Facing defeat, Chrétien did an U-turn on the question of a [...] "distinct society", saying in a speech on October 24 in Verdun that the federal government was now open to the idea of recognizing Quebec as a [...] "distinct society" [...] in the constitution. In a speech before the Liberal caucus on October 25, Chrétien acknowledged openly the possibility of defeat, and lashed out at the Quebec media whom he accused of pushing [...] "a big pile of shit" [...] that was allowing the yes side to win people over, and suggested that he might resign if the oui side won. On October 26, 1995, Montreal radio station disk jockey Pierre Brassard telephoned Queen Elizabeth II pretending to be Chrétien; he discussed the pending referendum, but also rambled about odd subjects, such as what the Queen would be wearing for Halloween and placing her effigy on Canadian Tire money. The Queen later said to Chrétien: [...] "I didn't think you sounded quite like yourself, but I thought, given all the duress you were <b>under,</b> <b>you</b> might have been drunk." [...] The result of Tobin's efforts was the Unity Rally of October 27, 1995, when 100,000 people showed up. On the night of the referendum, the prospect of a victory for the yes side was considered to be so realistic that Defence Minister David Collenette ordered the military to begin contingency plans to defend federal property in Quebec from a separatist take-over should the yes side prevail. On October 30, 1995, the federalist no side won by the narrowest of margins. Chrétien blamed the narrow victory on the Quebec Liberals under Johnson, whom he claimed had betrayed him, and argued the federalists would have done much better if only he had intervened in the referendum earlier, and presented the no case in terms of Trudeau-style [...] "hard federalism" [...] instead of the [...] "soft federalist" [...] no case presented by Johnson, which depicted the benefits of Confederation in purely economic terms, and had a strongly nationalist, albeit federalist tone of language.|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} genre elements, Damon Lindelof has stated that, [...] "We sort of suckered people into this show [...] not {{presenting}} it {{as a science}} fiction show {{right out of the}} gate … Lost has really been about the long con, because {{by the time we get}} to season 6, it's going to be...crazy!"s Past and Future]", IGN. [...] Retrieved on January 18, 2010. [...] The premiere will introduce a new narrative technique to the show, following flashbacks in the first five seasons, flashforwards in the third and fourth seasons and time travel in the fifth season. [...] According to Lindelof, who is apprehensive that the audience will not understand or reject it, [...] "the show demands constant shifts to best tell the story. [...] We've known what we were going to do for a couple years now and there's been a tremendous amount of work setting up the premise so it would work." [...] Lindelof has commented that the sixth season will most resemble the first for the show, even including characters sparsely seen since, saying, [...] "We want the show to feel like a loop is closing with this final year", to which Carlton Cuse added that when the characters in the first season [...] "were running around the jungle, things felt intense and surprising. [...] We have a way that we're going to be able to do that in the final season too." [...] Cuse has also stated, [...] "We feel tonally it's most similar to the first season of the show. [...] narrative device … is creating some emotional and heartfelt stories, and we want the audience to have a chance in the final season to remember the entire history of the show … We're hoping to achieve a circularity of the entire journey so the ending is reminiscent of the beginning." [...] Cuse further explained that the new narrative [...] "doesn't require either a deep investment or in-depth knowledge about the series", keeping in line with ABC Entertainment president Stephen McPherson's conclusion that [...] "you really don't have to have seen the show [...] [...] There will be stuff that will go completely over your head for sure, but because of the way that they're telling this last season, it is this beautiful standalone conclusion." [...] For years, Lindelof and Cuse have responded to theories about the greater meaning and answers of the show by pointing out that viewers did not have adequate information to theorize well. [...] Lindelof finally conceded that [...] "by the end of the season premiere of season six, you will have pretty much all the fundamental building blocks you need to put together a...theory as to what it all means and where the show [...] end." [...] Confronted that the bomb detonating would force a timeline change and thus render the past five seasons pointless, Damon Lindelof responded with [...] "Trust us." [...] While producing the fourth season, Lindelof said, [...] "We want people to believe in the stakes of the show. [...] The problem with alternative realities is that you never know when the rug is going to be pulled out from <b>under</b> <b>you.</b> [...] We want the audience to believe that the jeopardy is real. [...] Postulating alternative realities would be an escape valve that would be damaging that as a narrative value … Carlton and I are PRO time-space continuum bending! [...] But we're ANTI-paradox. [...] Paradox creates issues." [...] Actor Terry O'Quinn has divulged that [...] "it is revealed who Locke actually is. [...] Although that's still kind of a mystery of who is that. [...] But there's still a pretty big revelation there." ...|$|E
