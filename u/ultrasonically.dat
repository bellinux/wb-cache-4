25|$|Geogrids {{represent}} {{a rapidly growing}} segment within geosynthetics. Rather than being a woven, nonwoven or knitted textile fabric, geogrids are polymers formed into a very open, gridlike configuration, i.e., they have large apertures between individual ribs in the transverse and longitudinal directions. Geogrids are (a) either stretched in one, two or three directions for improved physical properties, (b) made on weaving or knitting machinery by standard textile manufacturing methods, or (c) by laser or <b>ultrasonically</b> bonding rods or straps together. There are many specific application areas; however, geogrids function almost exclusively as reinforcement materials.|$|E
25|$|In {{both the}} tension and shear joint design cases, some level of tension preload in the bolt and {{resulting}} compression preload in the clamped components {{is essential to the}} joint integrity. The preload target can be achieved by a variety of methods: applying a measured torque to the bolt, measuring bolt extension, heating to expand the bolt then turning the nut down, torquing the bolt to the yield point, testing <b>ultrasonically,</b> or by applying a certain number of degrees of relative rotation of the threaded components. Each method has a range of uncertainties associated with it, some of which are very substantial.|$|E
25|$|A {{contemporary}} woman's life-time {{probability of}} developing {{breast cancer is}} approximately one in seven; {{yet there is no}} causal evidence that fat grafting to the breast might be more conducive to breast cancer than are other breast procedures; because incidences of fat tissue necrosis and calcification occur in every such procedure: breast biopsy, implantation, radiation therapy, breast reduction, breast reconstruction, and liposuction of the breast. Nonetheless, detecting breast cancer is primary, and calcification incidence is secondary; thus, the patient is counselled to learn self-palpation of the breast and to undergo periodic mammographic examinations. Although the mammogram is the superior diagnostic technique for distinguishing among cancerous and benign lesions to the breast, any questionable lesion can be visualized <b>ultrasonically</b> and magnetically (MRI); biopsy follows any clinically suspicious lesion or indeterminate abnormality appeared in a radiograph.|$|E
25|$|Geocells (also {{known as}} Cellular Confinement Systems) are {{three-dimensional}} honeycombed cellular structures that form a confinement system when infilled with compacted soil. Extruded from polymeric materials into strips welded together <b>ultrasonically</b> in series, the strips are expanded {{to form the}} stiff (and typically textured and perforated) walls of a flexible 3D cellular mattress. Infilled with soil, a new composite entity is created from the cell-soil interactions. The cellular confinement reduces the lateral movement of soil particles, thereby maintaining compaction and forms a stiffened mattress that distributes loads over a wider area. Traditionally used in slope protection and earth retention applications, geocells made from advanced polymers are being increasingly adopted for long-term road and rail load support. Much larger geocells are also made from stiff geotextiles sewn into similar, but larger, unit cells that are used for protection bunkers and walls.|$|E
25|$|The {{substrate}} {{on which}} the film deposition takes place is <b>ultrasonically</b> cleaned and fastened to the substrate holder. The substrate holder {{is attached to the}} manipulator shaft. The manipulator shaft moves translationally to adjust the distance between the ingot source and the substrate. The shaft also rotates the substrate at a particular speed so that the film is uniformly deposited on the substrate. A negative bias DC voltage of 200–400 V {{can be applied to the}} substrate. Often, focused high-energy electrons from one of the electron guns or infrared light from heater lamps is used to preheat the substrate. Heating of the substrate allows increased adatom–substrate and adatom–film diffusion by giving the adatoms sufficient energy to overcome kinetic barriers. If a rough film, such as metallic nanorods, is desired substrate cooling with water or liquid nitrogen may be employed to reduce diffusion lifetime, positively bolstering surface kinetic barriers. To further enhance film roughness, the substrate may be mounted at a steep angle with respect to the flux to achieve geometric shadowing, where incoming line of sight flux lands onto only higher parts of the developing film. This method is known as glancing-angle deposition (GLAD) or oblique-angle deposition (OAD).|$|E
2500|$|One {{difference}} between ultrasonic welding and traditional welding {{is the ability}} of ultrasonic welding to join dissimilar materials. [...] The assembly of battery components {{is a good example of}} where this ability is utilized. [...] When creating battery and fuel cell components, thin gauge copper, nickel and aluminium connections, foil layers and metal meshes are often <b>ultrasonically</b> welded together. Multiple layers of foil or mesh can often be applied in a single weld eliminating steps and costs.|$|E
2500|$|Ultrasonicated honey {{has been}} {{processed}} by ultrasonication, a nonthermal processing alternative for honey. When honey {{is exposed to}} ultrasonication, most of the yeast cells are destroyed. Those cells that survive sonication generally lose their ability to grow, which reduces the rate of honey fermentation substantially. Ultrasonication also eliminates existing crystals and inhibits further crystallization in honey. <b>Ultrasonically</b> aided liquefaction can work at substantially lower temperatures around [...] and can reduce liquefaction time to less than 30 seconds.|$|E
2500|$|Polymer cores are not {{as common}} as metal cores and are usually only used for moldings that require simple {{internal}} surface details. They are usually [...] thick hollow cross-sections that are molded in two halves and are <b>ultrasonically</b> welded together. Their greatest advantage {{is that they can}} be molded in traditional injection molding machines that the company already has instead of investing into new die casting equipment and learning how to use it. Because of this polymer core materials are most adventitious for small production runs that cannot justify the added expense of metal cores. Unfortunately it is not as recyclable as the metal alloys used in cores, because 10% new material must be added with the recycled material.|$|E
2500|$|The {{applications}} of ultrasonic welding are extensive and {{are found in}} many industries including electrical and computer, automotive and aerospace, medical, and packaging. [...] Whether two items can be <b>ultrasonically</b> welded is determined by their thickness. [...] If they are too thick this process will not join them. [...] This is the main obstacle in the welding of metals. [...] However, wires, microcircuit connections, sheet metal, foils, ribbons and meshes are often joined using ultrasonic welding. [...] Ultrasonic welding is a very popular technique for bonding thermoplastics. [...] It is fast and easily automated with weld times often below one second {{and there is no}} ventilation system required to remove heat or exhaust. [...] This type of welding is often used to build assemblies that are too small, too complex, or too delicate for more common welding techniques.|$|E
2500|$|His {{interest}} in physics {{led him to}} develop new ultrasound technologies for examining and treating the eye. [...] Together with William Konig and Louis Katz, he created the first commercially available B-scan ultrasound equipment. [...] His numerous patents include those for an <b>ultrasonically</b> vibrated surgical knife, an ultrasonic diagnostic and therapeutic transducer assembly (with methodology), a system of therapeutic ultrasound and real-time ultrasonic scanning, and an ultrasound system for corneal biometry. His pioneering surgical techniques include the first vitreo-retinal surgery in New York and, using the ultrasound that he developed, demonstrating that operating at an earlier stage in ocular trauma could vastly improve the patient's prognosis for recovery. He has specialized in vitreo-retinal surgery and has had a career-long {{interest in}} imaging research. With a generous gift from Charles and Margaret Dyson, He established the Margaret M. Dyson Vision Research Institute, {{one of the major}} retinal research programs in the world. [...] The Dyson Institute continues research on the causes and possible therapies for age related macular degeneration and ultrasound imaging of the retina and choroid.|$|E

50|$|Whereas {{textiles}} {{are typically}} sewn together, other sail materials may be <b>ultrasonically</b> welded—a technique whereby high-frequency ultrasonic acoustic vibrations are locally applied to workpieces being held together {{under pressure to}} create a solid-state weld. It is commonly used for plastics, and especially for joining dissimilar materials.|$|E
5000|$|Chorioangioma (Placental hemangioma) is {{a benign}} tumor of placenta. It {{is seen in}} {{approximately}} 0.5 to 1% pregnancies.

Large chorioangiomas are known to cause complications in pregnancy, while the smaller ones are asymptomatic.|$|E
50|$|However, {{electronic}} filtering {{is inherently}} unable {{to solve this}} problem with the digital loudspeaker. The speaker elements must operate <b>ultrasonically</b> to avoid introducing (high levels of) audible artifacts, and this means ultrasonic airwaves are inevitable. Electronics can filter electrical signals, but can not remove ultrasonic frequencies already in the air.|$|E
50|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{hydroxyapatite}} synthesis via wet-chemical route can be improved by power ultrasound. The <b>ultrasonically</b> assisted synthesis (sono-synthesis) of hydroxyapatite is a successful technique to produce nanostructured hydroxyapatite at high quality standards. The ultrasonic route allows to produce nano-crystalline hydroxyapatite as well as modified particles, e.g. core-shell nanospheres, and composites.|$|E
50|$|Ultrasonic {{soldering}} uses either <b>ultrasonically</b> coupled heated solder iron tips (0.5 - 10 mm) or <b>ultrasonically</b> coupled solder baths {{as mentioned}} above. In these devices, piezoelectric crystals {{are used to}} generate high frequency (20 - 60 kHz) acoustic waves in molten solder layers or batch, to mechanically disrupt oxides that form on the molten solder surfaces. The tips for U/S soldering irons are also coupled to a heating element while the piezoelectric crystal is thermally isolated, not to degrade the piezoelectric element. Ultrasonic soldering iron tips can heat (up to 450 °C) while mechanically oscillating at 20 - 60 kHz. This soldering tip can melt solder filler metals as acoustic vibrations are induced in the molten solder pool. The vibration and cavitation in the molten solder then permits solders to wet and adhere to many metal surfaces.|$|E
50|$|The {{implementation}} {{of these systems}} {{can be achieved by}} using various technologies, such as electromagnetic fields, optical, or <b>ultrasonically</b> tracking, but all share the main limitation, they should have a fixed external reference, either a base, an array of cameras, or a set of visible markers, so this single system can be carried out in prepared areas.|$|E
5000|$|High-pressure {{cylinders}} {{that are}} used multiple times — as most are — can be hydrostatically or <b>ultrasonically</b> tested and visually examined every few years. [...] In the United States, hydrostatic/ultrasonic testing is required either every five years or every ten years, depending on cylinder and its service. Helium gas cylinders have the highest pressures possible when full, around 1000 atmospheres.|$|E
50|$|Tin(II) sulfide is a brown solid, {{insoluble}} in water, but soluble in concentrated hydrochloric acid. Tin (II) sulfide is soluble in (NH4)2S. It has a layer structure {{similar to}} that of black phosphorus. As per black phosphorus, tin(II) sulfide can be <b>ultrasonically</b> exfoliated in liquids to produce atomically thin semiconducting SnS sheets that have a wider optical band gap (>1.5 eV) compared to the bulk crystal.|$|E
50|$|Cellular {{confinement}} systems (CCS)—also {{known as}} geocells—are {{widely used in}} construction for erosion control, soil stabilization on flat ground and steep slopes, channel protection, and structural reinforcement for load support and earth retention. Typical cellular confinement systems are made with <b>ultrasonically</b> welded high-density polyethylene (HDPE) strips or novel polymeric alloy (NPA)—and expanded on-site to form a honeycomb-like structure—and filled with sand, soil, rock, gravel or concrete.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s an {{automated}} machine {{was invented by}} IMV. This machine would seal the straws (<b>ultrasonically)</b> one by one. Then several years later a machine that would fill and seal straws three at a time came out. This greatly increased processing times for bull studs. In the mid-2000s a machine that would not only fill three straws at a time but also {{have the capability to}} print the desired information on the straw, became available.|$|E

Composed of <b>ultrasonically</b> welded strips, the Neoweb geocell is opened up on-site {{to a form}} a 3D honeycomb-like matrix, and then infilled with soil material to stabilize and reinforce soil. In addition to the reinforcement of the subgrade, subbase or base layer of roads and railways, cellular confinement is also used for soil stabilization and erosion control in slopes, channels, retention walls, reservoirs and landfills.|$|E

5000|$|Dispersing {{graphite}} in {{a liquid}} medium can produce graphene by sonication followed by centrifugation, producing concentrations of [...] in N-methylpyrrolidone. Using a suitable ionic liquid as the dispersing liquid medium produced concentrations of [...] Restacking {{is an issue}} with this technique. Adding a surfactant to a solvent prior to sonication prevents restacking by adsorbing to the graphene's surface. This produces a higher graphene concentration, but removing the surfactant requires chemical treatments. The functionalization of <b>ultrasonically</b> prepared graphene nanosheets with polymers or biopolymers (e.g. polysaccharides) enables for the synthesis of water-dispersable graphene.|$|E
5000|$|The sonar {{guidance}} system {{was developed for}} Mod I and improved for Mod II. It used two ultrasonic transducers to determine distance, location within the halls, and obstructions in its path. This provided [...] "The Beast" [...] with bat-like guidance. At this point, it could detect obstructions in the hallway, such as people in the hallway. Once an obstruction was detected, the Beast would slow down and then decide whether to stop or divert around the obstruction. It could also <b>ultrasonically</b> recognize the stairway and doorways to take appropriate action.|$|E
