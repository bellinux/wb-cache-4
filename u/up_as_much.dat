Triceratops fossils are far and away the most common dinosaur remains found in the latest Cretaceous rocks in the western United States, making <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as 5/6ths of the large dinosaur fauna in some areas. These facts indicate that some ceratopsians were the dominant herbivores in their environments.|$|E
5|$|HTC One {{variants}} were unveiled {{for release}} in China in late-April 2013 with HTC TD101 802w for China Unicom, HTC TD101 802d for China Telecom, and HTC TD101 802t for China Mobile. Unlike the international version, the Chinese models feature a removable back cover, exposing a microSD slot for storage expansion and dual SIM card slots. Complementing this feature, {{a special edition}} with a Wang Leehom-autographed back cover was also released. HTC stated that {{it was able to}} include an SD card slot in the Chinese model because its radio hardware did not take <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> internal space as that of the international models.|$|E

5|$|The {{ring-tailed lemur}} is an {{opportunistic}} omnivore primarily eating fruits and leaves, {{particularly those of}} the tamarind tree (Tamarindus indica), known natively as kily. When available, tamarind makes <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as 50% of the diet, especially during the dry, winter season. The ring-tailed lemur eats from {{as many as three}} dozen different plant species, and its diet includes flowers, herbs, bark and sap. It has been observed eating decayed wood, earth, spider webs, insect cocoons, arthropods (spiders, caterpillars, cicadas and grasshoppers) and small vertebrates (birds and chameleons). During the dry season it becomes increasingly opportunistic.|$|E
5|$|Tensions and the {{geographic}} {{differences between the}} working and ruling classes led to Bacon's Rebellion in 1676, by which time current and former indentured servants made <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as 80% of the population. Rebels, largely from the colony's frontier, were also opposed to the conciliatory policy towards native tribes, and one result of the rebellion was the signing at Middle Plantation of the Treaty of 1677, which made the signatory tribes tributary states and {{was part of a}} pattern of appropriating tribal land by force and treaty. Middle Plantation saw the founding of The College of William & Mary in 1693 and was renamed Williamsburg as it became the colonial capital in 1699. In 1747, a group of Virginian speculators formed the Ohio Company, with the backing of the British crown, to start English settlement and trade in the Ohio Country west of the Appalachian Mountains. France, which claimed this area as part of their colony of New France, viewed this as a threat, and the ensuing French and Indian War became part of the Seven Years' War (1756–1763). A militia from several British colonies, called the Virginia Regiment, was led by then-Lieutenant Colonel George Washington.|$|E

25|$|Paul Ehrlich was a {{bacteriologist}} studying staining, {{a procedure}} that is used in many microscopic studies to make fine biological structures visible using chemical dyes. As Ehrlich injected some of these dyes (notably the aniline dyes that were then widely used), the dye stained all of the organs of some kinds of animals except for their brains. At that time, Ehrlich attributed this lack of staining to the brain simply not picking <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> of the dye.|$|E

25|$|Rice {{cultivation}} {{began in}} California during the California Gold Rush, when an estimated 40,000 Chinese laborers {{immigrated to the}} state and grew small amounts of the grain for their own consumption. However, commercial production began only in 1912 in the town of Richvale in Butte County. By 2006, California produced the second-largest rice crop in the United States, after Arkansas, with production concentrated in six counties north of Sacramento. Unlike the Arkansas–Mississippi Delta region, California's production is dominated by short- and medium-grain japonica varieties, including cultivars developed for the local climate such as Calrose, which makes <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as 85% of the state's crop.|$|E
25|$|The hosts {{did not put}} <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> {{fight in}} the second innings as in the first, however. During the course of 45 minutes, Irfan Pathan had removed four Zimbabwean batsmen – Taylor made 4, Masakadza 2, Ebrahim 2 and Streak a golden duck. Duffin, the {{discovery}} of the first innings, was also dismissed by Zaheer for 2. Only Taibu seemede vaguely comfortable against the swing bowler, and his partnership with Coventry at least added 49 runs on the board. However, in the last scheduled over of the day, Coventry gave a catch to Gambhir off Harbhajan Singh, resulting in Harbhajan's 200th Test wicket. Zimbabwe thus needed 208 for their last four wickets to avoid the innings defeat.|$|E

This once again is a huge health hazard and the Egyptian Government is looking for ways to combat this. The Cairo Cleaning and Beautification Agency was founded to collect and recycle the waste; however, they also work with the Zabbaleen (or Zabaleen), a community that has been collecting and recycling Cairo's waste {{since the turn of the}} 20th century and live in an area known locally as Manshiyat naser.

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1789, Paris became the center stage of the French Revolution and events that changed the history of France and Europe. In 1789, the {{population}} of Paris was between 600,000 and 640,000. Then as now, most wealthier Parisians lived {{in the western part}} of the city, the merchants in the center, and the workers and artisans in the southern and eastern parts, particularly the Faubourg Saint-Honoré. The population included about one hundred thousand extremely poor and unemployed persons, many of whom had recently moved to Paris to escape hunger in the countryside. Known as the sans-culottes, they made <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as a third of the population of the eastern neighborhoods and became important actors in the Revolution.|$|E
25|$|Tempranillo {{wines are}} ruby red in colour, while aromas and {{flavours}} can include berries, plum, tobacco, vanilla, leather and herb. Often making <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as 90% of a blend, Tempranillo is less frequently bottled {{as a single}} varietal. Being low in both acidity and sugar content, it is most commonly blended with Grenache (known as Garnacha in Spain), Carignan (known as Mazuela in Spain), Graciano, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. Blending the grape with Carignan makes a brighter and more acidic wine. Tempranillo is the major component of the typical Rioja blends and constitutes 90-100% of Ribera del Duero wines. In Australia, Tempranillo is blended with Grenache and Shiraz, also known as Syrah. In Portugal, where it is known as Tinta Roriz, {{it is a major}} grape in the production of some Port wines.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the medieval}} period the Catholic Church {{had always been}} {{important}} to the Spanish economy. This importance increased greatly in the reigns of Philip III and IV, who had bouts of intense personal piety and church philanthropy, donating {{large areas of the}} country to the Church. The later Habsburgs did nothing to promote the redistribution of land. By the end of Charles II's reign, most of Castile was {{in the hands of a}} select few landowners, the largest of which by far was the Church. It has been estimated that at the end of the 17th century the holdings of the Spanish church had expanded to include nearly 20% of Castilian land and that the clergy made <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as 10% of adult males in Castile. Government policy under the succeeding Bourbon dynasty was directed to steadily reducing the Church's vast holdings, which by then had come to be seen as an impediment to the country's development.|$|E

25|$|In other words, the {{considerable}} observable differences {{between humans and}} chimps may be due {{as much or more}} to genome level variation in the number, function and expression of genes rather than DNA sequence changes in shared genes. Indeed, even within humans, there {{has been found to be}} a previously unappreciated amount of copy number variation (CNV) which can make <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as 5 – 15% of the human genome. In other words, between humans, there could be +/- 500,000,000 base pairs of DNA, some being active genes, others inactivated, or active at different levels. The full significance of this finding remains to be seen. On average, a typical human protein-coding gene differs from its chimpanzee ortholog by only two amino acid substitutions; nearly one third of human genes have exactly the same protein translation as their chimpanzee orthologs. A major difference between the two genomes is human chromosome 2, which is equivalent to a fusion product of chimpanzee chromosomes 12 and 13. (later renamed to chromosomes 2A and 2B, respectively).|$|E

500|$|It was {{not always}} the case that every noun {{required}} a count-classifier. In many historical varieties of Chinese, use of classifiers was not mandatory, and classifiers are rare in writings that have survived. Some nouns acquired classifiers earlier than others; some of the first documented uses of classifiers were for inventorying items, both in mercantile business and in storytelling. Thus, the first nouns to have count-classifiers paired with them may have been nouns that represent [...] "culturally valued" [...] items such as horses, scrolls, and intellectuals. The special status of such items is still apparent today: many of the classifiers that can only be paired with one or two nouns, such as pǐ for horses and shǒu for songs or poems, are the classifiers for these same [...] "valued" [...] items. Such classifiers make <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as one-third of the commonly used classifiers today.|$|E

Most investors would label stock B as more risky. In fact, stock A has better return in every {{possible}} case. However, according to the capital asset pricing model, stock A and B {{would have the same}} beta, meaning that theoretically, investors would require the same rate of return for both stocks. This is an illustration of how using standard beta might mislead investors. The dual-beta model, in contrast, takes into account this issue and differentiates downside beta from upside beta, or downside risk from upside risk, and thus allows investors to make better informed investing decisions.|$|R
