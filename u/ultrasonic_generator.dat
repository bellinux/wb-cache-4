The users are generally not well aware of the details of the technology of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>generators</b> and cannot be asked to perform the complicated physical measurements to test their equipment. Frequently, the only way to check the performance of the device is the observance of oil or water bubbles on the surface of the piezoelectiric probe. If bubbles are present, the generator is regarded as operating correctly. Many surveys on the output of therapeutic ultrasound equipment have revealed discrepancies between the indicated and actual ultrasonic output of many devices. International safety standards recommend a limit below 30 % variation in acoustic intensity for ultrasound therapy equipment. So, further improvements in the accuracy of ultrasound machine calibration are needed. Proper calibration is essential to provide patients with a more accurate ultrasound dosage and, therefore, with a safer and more appropriate treatment. This review highlights the need for users to be aware of the potential inaccuracy of the machine and of the importance of regular calibration.

40|$|With {{reference}} to the application of magnetic oxides in the electronics industry, a comprehensive review is presented of the theoretical background of such materials existing {{up to the end}} of 1967. In considering magnetization characteristics of the spinel structure, attention is given to the crystal site preference of the various cations; in the commonly used ferrites, the magnetization is the net result of antiparallel magnetic moments of the cations. Also considered are ferromagnetic spinels with parallel moments; values are considered of the exchange interaction detg. the relative orientation of the magnetic moments and the magnetization/temp. curve. The relation of the magnetic anisotropy energy and the permeability (m) is discussed in terms of applications to transformers, inductors, etc. in the frequency range 103 - 108 Hz.; the value, sign, and temp. dependence of the anisotropy can be influenced by ion substitutions, e. g.

Stress-induced anisotropy is used in mech. devices such as <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>generators,</b> magnetoacoustic delay lines, etc.; anisotropy is also the cause of magnetostriction. Anisotropy relaxation is discussed, including influences of deviations from stoichiometry; cond., magnetic domain in ideal and in practical cases, where ceramic microstructure is of primary importance, damping, and microstructure are also considered.

40|$|AbstractFoam is a {{dispersion}} of gas in a liquid {{in which the}} distances between the gas bubbles are very small. Foams are frequently generated {{in the manufacture of}} many products as result from the aeration and agitation of liquids, from the vaporization of the liquid and also from biological or chemical reactions. Foams are generally an unwanted product in industrial processes because they cause difficulties in process control and in equipment operation. The most efficient conventional method for defoaming is the use of chemical agents but they contaminate the product. High-intensity ultrasonic waves offer a clean procedure to break foam bubbles. The potential use of ultrasound for foam breaking that was known since many years has been recently reinforced by the application of a new type of ultrasonic defoamer based on the stepped-plate high-power transducers to generate air-borne ultrasound. This defoamer has been successfully applied in several industrial problems such as the control of excess foam produced during the filling operation of bottles and cans on high-speed canning lines and in fermenting vessels and other reactors of great dimensions. The treatment of such industrial problems requires the proper characterization and quantification of the main parameters involved in the mechanisms of the defoaming effect.

The new droplet generator has demonstrated capability for producing micro droplets of controllable size and size distribution and desirable throughput at very low electrical drive power. For comparison, the serious deficiencies of current commercial droplet generators (nebulizers) and the other <b>ultrasonic</b> droplet <b>generators</b> explored in recent years are first discussed. The architecture, working principle, simulation, and design of the multiple Fourier horns (MFH) in resonance aimed at the amplified longitudinal vibration amplitude on the end face of nozzle tip, and the fabrication and characterization of the nozzles are then described in detail. Subsequently, a linear theory on the temporal instability of Faraday waves on a liquid layer resting on the planar end face of the MFHUN and the detailed experimental verifications are presented.
