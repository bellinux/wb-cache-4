40|$|The "universal" {{instability}} {{has recently}} been revived by Landreman, Antonsen and Dorland [1], who showed that it indeed exists in plasma geometries with straight (but sheared) magnetic field lines. Here it is demonstrated analytically that this instability can be present in more general sheared and toroidal geometries. In a torus, the <b>universal</b> <b>instability</b> is shown to be {{closely related to the}} trapped-electron mode, although the trapped-electron drive is usually dominant. However, this drive can be weakened or eliminated, as in the case in stellarators with the maximum-$J$ property, leaving the parallel Landau resonance to drive a residual mode, which is identified as the <b>universal</b> <b>instability...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{observed}} close {{correlation between}} the plasmapause and micropulsations is explained {{on the basis of}} a <b>universal</b> <b>instability</b> model. Both theoretical and experimental studies of a nonhomogeneous magnetoplasma indicate that a steep plasma density gradient at the plasmapause is likely the origin of the <b>universal</b> <b>instability</b> in the magnetosphere. Drift waves excited at the plasmapause may be unstable in the direction of the electron drift and propagate eastward nearly perpendicularly to the magnetic field. The drift waves, however, tend to convert very quickly to ion sound or Alfven waves with a much larger phase velocity parallel to the magnetic field. This may be a possible source mechanism for rather regular geomagnetic micropulsations, and specific mechanisms are identified for the long- and short-period cases...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the stability of}} a configuration consisting of a vertical magnetic field in a planar flow on elliptical streamlines in ideal hydromagnetics. In {{the absence of a}} magnetic field the elliptical flow is universally unstable (the ``elliptical instability''). We find this <b>universal</b> <b>instability</b> persists in the presence of magnetic fields of arbitrary strength, although the growthrate decreases somewhat. We also find further instabilities due to the presence of the magnetic field. One of these, a destabilization of Alfven waves, requires the magnetic parameter to exceed a certain critical value. A second, involving a mixing of hydrodynamic and magnetic modes, occurs for all magnetic-field strengths. These instabilities may be important in tidally distorted or otherwise elliptical disks. A disk of finite thickness is stable if the magnetic fieldstrength exceeds a critical value, similar to the fieldstrength which suppresses the magnetorotational instability.

40|$|The <b>universal</b> <b>instability</b> {{mechanism}} in an ascending moist air flow is theoretically proposed and analyzed. Its origin {{comes to the}} conflict between two processes: the increasing of pressure forcing applied to the boundary layer and the decelerating of the updraft flow due to air heating. It is shown that the intensification of tropical storm with the redistribution of wind velocities, pressure and temperature can result from the reorganization of the dissipative structure which key parameters are the moist air lifting velocity and the temperature of surrounding atmosphere. This reorganization can lead to formation of hurricane eye and inner ring of convection. A transition of the dissipative structure in a new state can occur when the temperature lapse rate in a zone of air lifting reaches certain critical value. The accordance of observational data with the proposed theoretical description is shown. Comment: 15 pages, 7 figure...|$|E

40|$|International audienceMagnetic {{fluctuations}} {{are recognized}} {{in a large}} variety of space plasmas by increasingly high resolution, in situ observations as mirror wave mode structures. A typical requirement for the excitation of mirror modes is a dominant perpendicular pressure in a high-beta plasma environment. Contrary, we demonstrate from a realistic kinetic analysis how details of the velocity space distributions are of considerable significance for the instability threshold. Introducing the most common characteristics of observed ion and electron distributions by a mixed suprathermal-loss-cone, we derive a <b>universal</b> mirror <b>instability</b> criterion from an energy principle for collisionless plasmas. As a result, the transition from two temperature Maxwellians to realistic non-thermal features provides a strong source for the generation of mirror wave mode activity, reducing drastically the instability threshold. In particular, a number of space-related examples illuminate how the specific structure of the velocity space distribution dominates as a regulating excitation mechanism over the effects related {{to changes in the}} plasma parameters...|$|R

A uniform magnetic field and a weak uniform density gradient are assumed. This paper differs from most other studies of this topic in three important ways: (1) no low frequency or long wavelength approximations are made, (2) no gauge condition is imposed and (3) a modification of the local approximation is used which is argued to be less arbitrary than the usual local approximation.

40|$|Observational {{evidence}} {{in space and}} astrophysical plasmas with long collisional mean free path suggests that more massive charged particles may be preferentially heated. One possible mechanism {{for this is the}} turbulent cascade of energy from injection to dissipation scales, where the energy is converted to heat. Here we consider a simple system consisting of a magnetized plasma slab of electrons and a single ion species with a cross-field density gradient. We show that such a system is subject to an electron drift wave instability, known as the <b>universal</b> <b>instability,</b> which is stabilized only when the electron and ion thermal speeds are equal. For unequal thermal speeds, we find that the instability gives rise to turbulent energy exchange between ions and electrons that acts to equalize the thermal speeds. Consequently, this turbulent heating tends to equalize the component temperatures of pair plasmas and to heat ions to much higher temperatures than electrons for conventional mass-ratio plasmas.

This article introduces a new queueing protocol called interval-strategy that {{is concerned with the}} reduction from dynamic to static routing. We discuss the maximum system time for a packet and estimate with up-to-date results how this can be achieved. We figure out the maximum amount of time where a packet can spend in the network (i. e. worst case system time), and argue that the <b>universal</b> <b>instability</b> of the presented interval-strategy can be reached through these results. When a large group of queueing strategies is used for queueing, we prove that the interval-strategy will be universally unstable.

The stabilizing effects related to the frictional constitutive law include velocity-strengthening friction (i. e. an increase in frictional resistance with increasing slip velocity, both instantaneous and under steady-state conditions) and a regularized response to normal stress variations.

Until now, however, it was not a success to identify a universal triggering mechanism responsible for the formation of the corresponding breaking of chiral vortex symmetry. Materials and methods In this paper we reveal the said linear <b>universal</b> <b>instability</b> mechanism of breaking of chiral symmetry in the sign of vortex circulation in the rotating medium in the presence of linear Eckman friction. Results Obtained is a condition for the linear dissipative - centrifugal instability (DCI), which leads (only when considering the external linear Eckman friction for an abovethreshold value of rotation frequency of the underlying boundary surface of fluid) to the breaking of chiral symmetry in the Lagrangian fluid particle dynamics and the corresponding realization of the cyclone-anticyclone vortex asymmetry. Conclusion A new non-stationary solution to the problem for the disc which carries out weak axial-torsional oscillations in fluid with the frequency which are superimposed on its rotation with the previously considered frequency ω 0 in connection with the experimental data on the rotating superfluid helium II has been found.

Here we report on a two-dimensional linear stability analysis of a deformable solid of a finite height H, steadily sliding on top of a rigid solid within a generic rate-and-state friction type constitutive framework, fully accounting for elastodynamic effects. We derive the linear stability spectrum, quantifying the interplay between stabilization related to the frictional constitutive law and destabilization related both to the elastodynamic bi-material coupling between normal stress variations and interfacial slip, and to finite size effects. The stabilizing effects related to the frictional constitutive law include velocity-strengthening friction (i. e. an increase in frictional resistance with increasing slip velocity, both instantaneous and under steady-state conditions) and a regularized response to normal stress variations. We first consider the small wave-number k limit and demonstrate that homogeneous sliding in this case is universally unstable, independent of the details of the friction law. This <b>universal</b> <b>instability</b> is mediated by propagating waveguide-like modes, whose fastest growing mode is characterized by a wave-number satisfying kH∼O(1) kH∼O(1) and by a growth rate that scales with H− 1.

We show that the dominant instability mode travels at nearly the dilatational wave-speed in the opposite direction to the sliding direction. In a certain parameter range this instability is manifested through unstable modes at all wave-numbers, yet the frictional response is shown to be mathematically well-posed. Instability modes which travel at nearly the shear wave-speed in the sliding direction also exist in some range of physical parameters.
