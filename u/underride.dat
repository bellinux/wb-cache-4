500|$|Reports that Mansfield was decapitated are untrue, {{although}} she suffered severe head trauma. The urban legend was spawned {{by the appearance}} in police photographs of a crashed car with its top virtually sheared off, and what resembled a blonde-haired head tangled in the car's smashed windshield. However, this was a wig Mansfield was wearing and possibly parts of her actual hair and scalp. The death certificate stated that the immediate cause of Mansfield's death was a [...] "crushed skull with avulsion of cranium and brain".

5000|$|Following the 1967 {{death of}} actress Jayne Mansfield in an auto/truck accident, the US {{government}} agency NHTSA recommended requiring a rear <b>underride</b> guard, {{also known as}} a [...] "Mansfield bar", an [...] "ICC bar", or a [...] "DOT (Department of Transportation) bumper". They are required to be not more than 22 in from the road. The trucking industry has been slow to upgrade this safety feature, and there are no requirements to repair ICC bars damaged in service. However, in 1996 NHTSA upgraded the requirements for the rear <b>underride</b> prevention structure on truck trailers, and Transport Canada went further with an even more stringent requirement for energy-absorbing rear <b>underride</b> guards, and in July 2015 NHTSA issued a proposal to upgrade the US performance requirements for <b>underride</b> guards.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to rear <b>underride</b> guards, truck tractor cabs may {{be equipped with}} a Front Underrun Protection System (FUPS) at the front bumper of the truck. The safest tractor-trailers are also equipped with side <b>underride</b> guards, also called Side Underrun Protection System (SUPS). These additional barriers prevent passenger cars from skidding underneath the trailer from the side, such as in an oblique or side collision, or if the trailer jackknifes across the road. In {{addition to}} safety benefits, these <b>underride</b> guards may improve fuel mileage by reducing air turbulence under the trailer at highway speeds.|$|E
50|$|Many European {{nations have}} also {{required}} side <b>underride</b> guards, to mitigate against lethal collisions where the car impacts the truck from the side.

5000|$|Thinning of the Cordilleran has {{previously}} been thought to be evidence and reason for flat subduction in the Sevier and Laramide orogenic events. However, isotopic data suggests that preservation of Cordilleran lithosphere implies Cordilleran thinning is not a sufficient answer for Sevier and Laramide flat subduction. This implies thinning and shearing of the Cordilleran was confined to the fore-arc region. [...] Data suggests throughout the Sevier-Laramide thrusting the crust was also uplifted and extended. [...] The modern Chilean subduction {{is thought to be}} a parallel model of the Sevier and Laramide events so there are possibly answers to this question in this modern model. Explanations may include a combination of plate motion rates increasing, the <b>underriding</b> oceanic plate becoming younger as the older portion subducts, and thus the <b>underriding</b> plate being hotter and more buoyant.|$|R
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} kinematic {{model for}} lithospheric thrusting that considers the flexural interction between the <b>underriding</b> and overriding plates {{was used to}} assess the mechanical implications of subducting trench-parallel fracture zones on the topography and free-air gravity anomalies of the Puysegur ridge/trench system. Fracture zones in the <b>underriding</b> plate are simulated by vertical discontinuities across which bending and shearing stresses cannot be supported. The implication of reactivating fracture zones on the outer trench slope is to suppresss the flexural bulge, creating topographic relief between the fracture zone and the trench, and reducing the trench gravity anomaly. In the studied region the trench subparallel l'Atalante fracture zone accounts for the lack of a flexural bulge, strong outer trench slope, and gravity gradients. The southward decrease of the trench fracture zone distance results in a decrease of the trench gravity anomaly. The effect of subducting and vertically reactivating fracture zones within the <b>underriding</b> plate is to segment the load of the overriding plate, creating a trough located above the underthrust fracture zone. The vertical offset and gravity modifications are functions of the fracture zone position relative to the trench. This model explains the 3500 -m-deep troughs and the 1700 -m subsidence observed at the Puysegure ridge. We speculate that reactiviating underthrust fracture zones can facilitate strike slip faults development withn the upper plate in case of oblique subduction and are conducive to the formation and dispersion of terranes at convergent margins. This process can account for basal tectonic erosion. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|Deep {{and bottom}} {{water from the}} Enderby basin, which is {{strongly}} enriched in silicate, enters the Weddell Sea off Kapp Norvegia parallel to the coast. However, the bottom water in this region originates from the northern Weddell Sea, indicating a southward return flow of bottom water west of the prime meridian. The eastern Weddell Sea margin was identified as the place where a significant silicate enrichment (at least 15 µmol kg- 1) and a weak CO 2 enrichment of the bottom water takes place, related to a regional recirculation cell. The deep and bottom water continue their course through the Weddell Sea along {{the base of the}} continental slope, where further in the west they are <b>underridden</b> by a thin layer of new, silicate-poor bottom water. A silicate maximum and weak TCO 2 maximum are formed at the interface between deep and bottom water at approximately 4000 m. This silicate maximum occurs in the central Weddell Sea as well. This indicates an exchange of the deep water between the boundaries and the interior of the Weddell basin; as an important site for this the northwestern Weddell Sea was identified. Bottom layer enrichment by CO 2 in the central Weddell Sea (3 µmol kg- 1) is comparable to that in the eastern Weddell Sea, but silicate enrichment in the former is much less than in the latter.

40|$|In the Upington region, {{there are}} three major- tectonic crustal provinces; namely the Kaapvaal Craton, Kheis and Namaqua tectonic provinces. The Eburnian-aged (early Proterozoic) Kheis Province {{developed}} along the western flank of the Archaean Kaapvaal Craton while the Kibaran-aged (middle Proterozoic) Namaqua Metamorphic Province, superimposed on the Eburnian-aged basement, developed {{to the east of}} the Kheis Province. The Namaqua Metamorphic Province is divided into the Gordonia and Bushmanland Subprovinces, the former being further subdivided into various tectonostratigraphic terranes. These are termed, from west to east, the Kakamas, Areachap, and Upington Terranes. The Upington Terrane includes fault bounded grabens with accompanied bimodal volcanism and sedimentation of the Wilgenhoutsdrif and Koras Groups. The Areachap Terrane consists predominantly of amphibolites generated in an island arc environment while the Kakamas Terrane is characterised by volcano-sedimentary sequences which have been extensively intruded by syn to late-tectonic predominantly I-type Keimoes Suite granitoids. The main styles of mineralisation correlate well with the various tectonostratigraphic terranes. Sedimentary exhalative massive sulphide deposits are characteristic of the Bushmanland Subprovince and are thought {{to be associated with the}} deposits at Aggeneys and Putsberg to the west of the area under investigation. These deposits are considered to have been deposited in an east-west-elongated intracontinental basin. The Kakamas Terrane is typified by granite-related mineralisation. In the eastern portion of the Kakamas Terrane, Sn-Wand base metal-bearing veins occur while pegmatites are developed in the western portion. These two styles of granite-related mineralisation is considered to reflect differing depths of formation due mainly to varying degrees of thrusting. The Areachap Terrane consists of volcanogenic massive sulphide deposits of the Besshi-type and is considered to have formed in a back-arc environment. In the Upington Terrane, the Wilgenhoutsdrif and Koras Groups consists essentially of minor Cu occurrences mainly disseminated within basalts and in structural trap sites. The possibility for sediment-hosted Cu deposits is not ruled out. More recent surface processes have led to uranium and gypsum deposits in pans, river beds and calcretes. Eburnian aged tectonic setting remains enigmatic. Kibaran-aged tectonics which best fits the metallogeny of the area under investigation is considered to be of a subduction zone from west to east formed by the collision of the Bushmanland "microcontinent" against the Kaapvaal Craton. Subduction fbrmed an island arc setting in which the massive sulphide deposits were formed in the Areachap Terrane while the Wilgenhoutsdrif Groups developed in a marginal basin. Further convergence led to collision of the two continents and <b>underriding</b> of the Bushmanland "microcontinent" which generated predominantly I-type granitoids represented by the Keimoes Suite. The level of emplacement of these granitoids is a reflection of the degree of foreland thrusting and produced shallower level Sn-W and base metal vein-type mineralisation closer to the suture zone and deeper level pegmatites further from the suture zone to the west. The final period of deformation is represented by northward lateral movement which created "pull apart" fault-bounded basins into which the Koras Group was deposited. ...|$|R

40|$|December 2006. "Accidents {{with heavy}} vehicles, {{especially}} in <b>underride</b> crashes, be it rear, side or frontal, {{are responsible for}} thousands of deaths all over the world. In many cases, these tragedies are consequences of not having effective <b>underride</b> guards mounted to the rear, side and front of the heavy vehicles. Lack of effective <b>underride</b> guards brings less compatibility making heavy vehicles more aggressive on roads. Several designs have been designed for energy absorbing <b>underride</b> guards. A new <b>underride</b> guard is developed based on the mechanical principle of simple pliers tool was conceived by Louis Otto Faber Schmutzler, SAE BRAZIL 1995. This research work describes nature of underrides, the design and analysis of two new guards for rear and side, vehicle behavior at different speeds and prevention of passenger compartment intrusion. With the advance in computer simulations, full finite element validated vehicle models are being analyzed for different impact scenarios. The main purpose of building the simulation models {{is to reduce the}} real time tests which are associated with significant cost. In this thesis, two new guards for rear and side are modeled using MSC-Patran and the performance of the guard in preventing passenger compartment intrusion is analyzed using LS- Dyna. A zero passenger compartment intrusion is achieved with the employment of the newly designed <b>underride</b> guards for rear and side of the trucks. The newly designed guard models are validated using FMVSS 223 / 224 regulations.

40|$|Abstract: Several crash {{discrimination}} algorithms {{have been}} developed {{in order to have}} timely air bag deployment during frontal crashes. However, it is still challenging to have timely air bag deploy-ment, especially during pole, <b>underride,</b> oblique and oVset crashes. Therefore, in this paper, a new algorithm for frontal crash discrimination is proposed, with the summation of the absolute value of the deceleration change being used as a metric and with the metric and its threshold being processed {{as a function of the}} velocity change. The new algorithm was applied to frontal crashes of a minivan and a sports utility vehicle, and it resulted in timely air bag deployment for frontal crashes, including pole, <b>underride,</b> oblique and oVset crashes. Moreover, it is proposed that an accelerometer be installed on each side of the rockers or pillars to assess the crash severity of each side and to deploy driver and passenger air bags at diVerent times, especially during an asymmetric crash such as an oblique and an oVset crash. As an example, the deceleration signals measured at the left and right B-pillar/rocker locations were processed through the algorithm, and earlier time-to-res (TTFs) were obtained for the air bag on the struck side than for the air bag on the non-struck side...|$|E
