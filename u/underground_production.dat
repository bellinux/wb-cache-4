25|$|Blast mining or {{conventional}} mining, is {{an older}} practice that uses explosives such as dynamite {{to break up}} the coal seam, after which the coal is gathered and loaded onto shuttle cars or conveyors for removal to a central loading area. This process consists of a series of operations that begins with “cutting” the coalbed so it will break easily when blasted with explosives. This type of mining accounts for less than 5 percent of total <b>underground</b> <b>production</b> in the US today.|$|E
2500|$|Longwall mining {{accounts}} for about 50 percent of <b>underground</b> <b>production.</b> The longwall shearer has a face of [...] or more. It is a sophisticated machine with a rotating drum that moves mechanically {{back and forth across}} a wide coal seam. The loosened coal falls onto an armored chain conveyor or pan line that takes the coal to the conveyor belt for removal from the work area. Longwall systems have their own hydraulic roof supports which advance with the machine as mining progresses. As the longwall mining equipment moves forward, overlying rock that is no longer supported by coal is allowed to fall behind the operation in a controlled manner. The supports make possible high levels of production and safety. Sensors detect how much coal remains in the seam while robotic controls enhance efficiency. Longwall systems allow a 60-to-100 percent coal recovery rate when surrounding geology allows their use. Once the coal is removed, usually 75 percent of the section, the roof is allowed to collapse in a safe manner.|$|E
