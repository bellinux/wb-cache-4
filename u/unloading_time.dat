40|$|We study an {{automated}} container terminal in which Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) {{are used to}} internally transport containers and Automated Stacking Cranes (ASCs) to store and retrieve containers. In designing container terminals, the terminal management has to consider the choice for interrelated AGV and ASC dispatching rules and {{the layout of the}} stack. In this paper, we, therefore, examine the joint decision problem of dispatching containers to AGVs, selecting ASCs and the layout of the stock. In choosing a certain combination of dispatching rules and layout, we have considered criteria, such as, <b>unloading</b> <b>times</b> of a ship, number of vehicles required and utilisation of equipment. From this specific study, we can conclude that hardly any differences in <b>unloading</b> <b>times</b> can be obtained if we choose another combination of AGV and ASC dispatching rules. However, savings of approximately 20 % in the number of AGVs can be obtained, if we apply the nearest-AGV-first rule in combination with the cyclic ASC rule. The results of the layout experiments only show small variations in <b>unloading</b> <b>times,</b> but they justify further research to the options for ASCs to span a wider stack. From the sensitivity analysis, it can be concluded that Quay Cranes should be distributed as evenly as possible over the stip and that twin-load AGVs can be used to obtain significant savings in <b>unloading</b> <b>times</b> and up to 50 % reductions in the number of AGVs required.

The batch dryers are usually {{operating}} under this sequence and repeating this sequence for several times. The bin-batch drying methods employ a full perforated floor as the dryer. Without stirring, large variety of equipment is available and the batch {{can be used as}} both dryer and cooler, but there may be large moisture gradient from top to bottom and losing time in loading and unloading process. When adding stirring system, unequilibrium moisture content problem is avoided, however, stirrer is an added expense. When using bin-batch roof dryer, time losing problem can be solved. There is a drying floor under the bin roof and the drying fan and burner is installed high on the bin wall. When the drying process is completed, grain is put in the regular bin floor, thus <b>unloading</b> <b>time</b> is reduced. However, there is no wet grain holding in bin-batch roof dryers and there is more expense on machines.|$|E

40|$|Royal Boskalis Westminster nv is an {{international}} group with a leading {{position in the world}} market for dredging services. In most practical cases a jet installation or a big discharge aperture is used for the fast unloading of a load of sand. When a relative small discharge opening, without the use of a jet installation, is used to unload a hopper, the <b>unloading</b> <b>time</b> will increase. Uncertain is how much longer this type of unloading will take and what kind of mechanisms {{play a crucial role in}} this unloading procedure. The goal of this study is to analyse and describe this unloading process. An attempt is made to model the processes in such a way that an estimation can be made for the <b>unloading</b> <b>time.</b> During this research two sets of experiments were executed, the preliminary and the main experiments, each with a different experiment set-up, to obtain more insight in the unloading process. The goal of both sets of experiments was to get a two dimensional view on the sand-water-processes above the discharge opening. The most important parameters which are varied during the experiments are the width of the discharge opening (wdo) and the height of the sand at the start of the unloading process. Out of the preliminary and main experiment comes the qualitative description of the unloading process in time: 1. Coming into existence of a dome. 2. The failure of the dome. 3. Fluidization of sand mass. 4. Break through of water through the sand-water mixture 5. Breaching of sand from the walls at both sides of the discharge opening. For two components out of the unloading process a first set-up for a quantitative model is made with as final goal a good prediction of the total <b>unloading</b> <b>time</b> of a barge. These two components are: 1. The dome that comes into existence 2. The moment of failure of the dome With the theory in this thesis and the data of the executed experiments can be concluded: Total unloading time: o The total <b>unloading</b> <b>time</b> decreases for an increasing width of the discharge opening Expanding velocities: o A new approach has been developed for the single particle mode in which the perpendicular expanding velocity for the roof of the dome (?= 180 degrees) is approximately 2. 2 times larger than expanding velocity perpendicular to the vertical walls (?= 90 degrees). This new approach fits a lot better with the data out of the experiments for the expanding velocities of the dome, but is not yet completely satisfying.

40|$|At {{automated}} container terminals, containers are transshipped {{from one}} {{mode of transportation}} to another. Automated vehicles transport containers from the stack to the ship and vice versa. Two different types of automated vehicles are studied in this paper, namely automated lifting vehicles and automated guided vehicles. An automated lifting vehicle is capable of lifting a container from the ground by itself. An automated guided vehicles needs a crane to receive and deliver a container. In designing automated container terminals one {{have to consider the}} choice for a certain type of equipment. The choice for a certain type of equipment should be made by performing a feasibility and economic analysis on various types of equipment. In this paper, we examine effects of using automated guided vehicles and automated lifting vehicles on <b>unloading</b> <b>times</b> of a ship, with simulation studies. In choosing a certain type of equipment we have considered criteria such as <b>unloading</b> <b>times</b> of a ship, occupancy degrees and the number of vehicles required. 38 % more AGVs need to be used than ALVs. From this specific study, we conclude that, by observing only purchasing costs of equipment, ALVs are a cheaper option than AGVs. To obtain an accurate analysis we have performed a sensitivity analysis. It can be concluded that the design of the terminal and technical aspects of quay cranes impact the number of vehicles required and as a result the choice for a certain type of equipment. © Springer-Verlag 2004...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Presentation date: 1994 - 07 - 22 This study {{concerns}} {{the use of}} a discrete-event simulation model for analyzing the production of a mechanized forest harvest system. The simulation models a field collection data set of a harvester-forwarder system which was previously collected by the Forest Engineering Department of Oregon State University. The computer software consisted of the statistical package Statgraphics and the simulation package Promodel PC. Special emphasis is given to the use of statistical distributions and linear regressions as simulation input data. The simulation model was built in productive machine time. Input quality and output capabilities of the simulation language Promodel PC produced realistic output of weekly predicted production of the system. Also, linear regressions of average yarding distance and <b>unloading</b> <b>time</b> of the forwarder estimated the production of the harvest system. The <b>unloading</b> <b>time</b> regression was used to develop a cost evaluation of the possibility of adding a loader to the harvest system.

These functions allow an easy programming transition despite the different system products. On the other hand, animation produced more model building difficulties than output benefits.
