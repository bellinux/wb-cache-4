5|$|On 20 February, {{companies}} of the 1st/4th Battalion, King's Shropshire Light Infantry (Territorials) arrived from Rangoon {{to relieve the}} sailors and the marines. They succeeded in quickly rounding <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> of the mutineers.|$|E
5|$|At 4:10am, the RMS Carpathia {{arrived at}} the site of the sinking and began rescuing survivors.

Of the 711 passengers and crew rescued by the Carpathia, six, including first class passenger William F. Hoyt, either died in a lifeboat during the night or on board the Carpathia the next morning, and were buried at sea.|$|E
5|$|Post-war {{growth in}} {{newspaper}} readership prompted an even larger, $3.5 million expansion in 1964 to fit eight-unit presses {{and a new}} three-story press room {{to the west of}} the printing plant. Four years later, an even larger $6 million addition would use <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> of the surface parking lots on the property's block, building a two-story newsroom clad in reinforced concrete instead of the limestone used on the 1931 building; a skybridge was built across an alley to connect to the older office building. In 1979, the new newsroom was renovated and modernized and a nearby alley was filled and enclosed.|$|E

5|$|The 24th Infantry {{consistently}} captured Battle Mountain in {{the same}} way. Artillery, mortar, and tank fire raked the crest and air strikes employing napalm blanketed {{the top of the}} peak. Then, the infantry attacked from the hill beneath the east slope of the summit. Supporting mortars would set up a base of fire and kept the heights under barrage until the infantry had arrived at a point just short of the crest. The mortar fire then lifted and the infantry moved rapidly <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> stretch to the top, usually to find it abandoned by the North Koreans.|$|E
5|$|Three {{teams from}} the League of Legends Champions Korea (LCK) circuit and one from the European League of Legends Championship Series (EULCS) {{made it to the}} semi-finals. H2K-Gaming ended the {{wildcard}} run of Albus NoX by sweeping them 3–0 in the quarterfinals. Meanwhile, the three Korean teams ended the runs of EDward Gaming and Royal Never Give <b>Up,</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> two Chinese teams, and the run of Cloud 9, the last North American team.|$|E
5|$|Using {{his various}} natural {{abilities}} and occasionally items or power-ups, Kirby must overcome obstacles while heading towards a goal door {{at end of}} the level, where he must fight a boss to obtain one of the Sparkling Stars. Most bosses are fought by sucking up the projectiles they create and spitting them back at the boss, however, the boss of the third level briefly turns the game into a Shoot 'em <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> <b>last</b> level before the final boss consists of a boss rush, where the player must fight all of the game's bosses again going through a short area based on the boss's home level.|$|E

5|$|Production on The Orphanage {{began on}} May 15, 2006 in Llanes, Asturias. This {{location}} was chosen {{due to the}} area's diverse natural settings that include beaches, caves, cliffs, forests, a small village, and the Partarríu Manor where the orphanage scenes take place. The orphanage was an old colonial house {{from the end of}} the nineteenth century. Bayona wanted to use certain cinematographic techniques that were impossible to achieve in the house, so several parts of the house were reconstructed in sound stages. After four weeks in Llanes, the team moved to Barcelona to finish <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> ten weeks of filming in sound stages, making over 80% of the film there. Bayona showed the films La residencia and The Innocents to his director of photography on the film, to make special notice of the Scope lensing used in both films.|$|E
25|$|In the WHA's last season, Kent Nilsson had 107 points, while Morris Lukowich had 65 goals, and Peter Sullivan had 46 {{goals and}} 86 points. The Jets {{made it to}} the Avco Cup and Gary Smith gave <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> goal in WHA history to Dave Semenko in a 7–3 Jets win.|$|E

25|$|When {{day three}} began, England may have harboured hopes of picking <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> four Australian wickets quickly, and setting about {{building}} a solid lead, however Steve Waugh wanted to press on. He was seeing the ball well, and moving {{into some of the}} best form of his career so far, and made the most of it. Well supported by Hughes, who made a solid 30, Waugh began to free his arms, and lifted the Australian's run-rate.|$|E
25|$|In August 1988, Wesbecker {{stopped working}} and was finally {{put on a}} {{long-term}} disability leave in February 1989, though {{there was also an}} agreement to re-employ him as soon as he recovered sufficiently. Between August 1988 and May 1989 Wesbecker bought several weapons, among them the AK-47 and pistol he later used in the shooting. Shortly before the shooting at Standard Gravure, where he showed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> time on September 13, Wesbecker presumably received a letter from the company, announcing the cancellation of his disability income.|$|E
25|$|Under his leadership, the Rough Riders {{became famous}} for the charge up Kettle Hill on July 1, 1898, while {{supporting}} the regulars. Roosevelt had the only horse, and rode {{back and forth between}} rifle pits {{at the forefront of the}} advance up Kettle Hill, an advance that he urged despite the absence of any orders from superiors. He was forced to walk <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> part of Kettle Hill, because his horse had been entangled in barbed wire. The victories came at a cost of 200 killed and 1,000 wounded.|$|E

25|$|By the mid-1920s, only {{a handful}} of {{survivors}} were able to attend the reunions. In 1929, only two men attended the Southern reunion. The next year, only one man showed <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> <b>last</b> Northern survivor, Private Jordan Barr of the 15th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment, died on May 16, 1938 at age 93. The last of the Southern survivors, and last overall survivor, was Private Charles M. Eldridge of the 3rd Tennessee Cavalry, who died at his home at age 96 on September 8, 1941, more than 76 years after the Sultana disaster.|$|E
25|$|Bogdanovich {{followed}} <b>up</b> <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> Picture Show {{with the}} popular comedy What's Up, Doc? (1972), starring Barbra Streisand and Ryan O'Neal, a screwball comedy indebted to Hawks's Bringing Up Baby (1938) and His Girl Friday (1940). Despite his reliance on homage to bygone cinema, Bogdanovich solidified his status {{as one of a}} new breed of A-list directors that included Academy Award winners Francis Ford Coppola and William Friedkin, with whom he formed The Directors Company. The Directors Company was a generous production deal with Paramount Pictures that essentially gave the directors carte blanche if they kept within budget limitations. It was through this entity that Bogdanovich's Paper Moon (1973) was produced.|$|E
25|$|Taylor and Marsh {{went on the}} attack, {{sensing the}} {{possibility}} of a humiliating 10 wicket victory. However it was not to be. They made a solid opening stand of 62, but Marsh mistimed Emburey to be caught by Robinson for 31. That left Boon to come in, and he and Taylor mopped <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> few runs. Boon swept Nick Cook to the square leg boundary for four to bring up the winning runs, and Australia had regained the Ashes by taking an unassailable 3-0 lead with only two tests remaining to be played. Geoff Lawson's match figures of 9 for 153 earned him the man-of-the-match award.|$|E

25|$|The Hungarians Re.2000s {{had their}} most {{successful}} day on 9 August 1942. That day, {{near the village}} of Davidovka, 16 Ilyushin Il-2s and a similar number of LaGG-3S were intercepted by four Reggianes. The Hungarians downed four LaGGs, suffering the loss of the Re.2000 of Lt Takács, who crash-landed behind his own lines, wounded. The Hungarian Reggianes flew their last sorties on the Soviet front on 14 and 15 January 1943, when they took off for uneventful patrols and reconnaissance missions. Between 16 and 19 January, with the Red Army rapidly approaching Ilovskoje airfield, and with no time to heat the Piaggio engine's frozen oil, mechanics were forced to blow <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> unserviceable Hejas.|$|E
25|$|The inaugural {{event was}} titled the McDonald's Bicentennial Youth World Cup, and {{was held in}} 1988 {{as part of the}} Australian Bicentenary celebrations. It took place in South Australia and Victoria. Teams from the seven Test-playing nations, as well as an ICC Associates XI, competed in a {{round-robin}} format. Australia lost only one match, their final round-robin game against Pakistan by which time they had qualified for the semis. They went on to beat Pakistan by five wickets in the final, thanks to an unbeaten hundred from Brett Williams. England and West Indies made <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> four, but India were the real disappointments. After opening with a good win against England, they suffered hefty defeats in four matches to be knocked out early.|$|E
25|$|At the Battle of Sutherland's Station, a Union Army {{division}} {{under the}} command of Brigadier General Nelson A. Miles broke <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> defense of the South Side Railroad on the afternoon of April 2, cutting off that railroad as a supply line or route of retreat for the Confederates. The initial attack by a single Union brigade against a hastily fortified line was repulsed with heavy losses. After a second futile attempt to take the Confederate position by two Union brigades, Miles attacked again with his entire force in mid-afternoon and overwhelmed the Confederates, starting {{with the collapse of the}} brigade of Brig. Gen. Samuel McGowan on the Confederate left flank. As a result of the Confederate defeat, the South Side Railroad, the Confederates' last supply line, was cut and General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia had to abandon Petersburg and Richmond and flee westward.|$|E
