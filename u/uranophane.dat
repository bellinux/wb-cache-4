40|$|Contamination of vadose zone sediments under tank BX- 102 at the Hanford site, Washington, {{resulted}} from the accidental release of 7 - 8 metric tons of uranium dissolved in caustic aqueous sludge in 1951. We have applied synchrotron-based X-ray spectroscopic and diffraction techniques to characterize the speciation of uranium in samples of these contaminated sediments. U LIII-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopic studies demonstrate that uranium occurs predominantly as a uranium- (VI) silicate from the <b>uranophane</b> group of minerals. XAFS cannot distinguish between {{the members of this}} mineral group due to the near identical local coordination environments of uranium in these phases. However, these phases differ crystallographically, and can be distinguished using X-ray diffraction (XRD) methods. As the concentration of uranium was too low for conventional XRD to detect these phases, X-ray microdiffraction (µXRD) was used to collect diffraction patterns on ~ 20 µm diameter areas of localized high uranium concentration found using microscanning X-ray fluorescence (µSXRF). Only sodium boltwoodite, Na(UO 2) (SiO 3 OH) • 1. 5 H 2 O, was observed; no other <b>uranophane</b> group minerals were present. Sodium boltwoodite formation has effectively sequestered uranium in these sediments under the current geochemical and hydrologic conditions.

Uranyl mineral basal surface microtopography, micromorphology, and composition were examined prior to, and after dissolution experiments on micrometer scale specimens using atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Evolution of etch pit depth at different pH values and experimental durations can be explained using a stepwave dissolution model. Effects of the cation in solution on etch pit symmetry and morphology can be explained using an adsorption model involving specific surface sites. Surface precipitation of the following phases was observed: (a) a highly-hydrated uranyl-hydroxy-hydrate in ultrapure water (on all minerals), (b) a Na-uranyl-hydroxy-hydrate in Na 2 CO 3 solution of pH 10. 5 (on uranyl-hydroxy-hydrate minerals), (c) a Na-uranyl-carbonate on zippeite, (d) Ba- and Pb-uranyl-hydroxy-hydrates in Ba-HCl and Pb-HCl solutions of pH 2 (on <b>uranophane),</b> (e) a (SiOx(OH) 4 − 2 x) phase in solutions of pH 2 (<b>uranophane),</b> and (f) sulfate-bearing phases in solutions of pH 2 and 3. 5 (on zippeite...|$|E

In 30 day batch experiments, {{only a small}} fraction of total U (~ 7. 4 %) was released to artificial groundwater solutions equilibrated with 1 % pCO 2. Synchrotron-based micro-X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy analyses showed that U was distributed among at least two types of species: (i) U discrete grains associated with Cu and (ii) areas with intermediate U concentrations on grains and grain coatings. Metatorbernite (Cu[UO 2] 2 [PO 4] 2 • 8 H 2 O) and <b>uranophane</b> (Ca[UO 2] 2 [SiO 3 (OH) ] 2 • 5 H 2 O) at some U discrete grains, and muscovite at U intermediate concentration areas, were identified in synchrotron-based micro-X-ray diffraction.

In µ- and bulk-X-ray absorption structure (µ-XAS and XAS) spectroscopy analyses, the structure of metatorbernite with additional U-C and U-U coordination environments was consistently observed at U discrete grains with high U concentrations. The consistency of the µ- and bulk-XAS analyses suggests that metatorbernite may comprise a significant fraction of the total U in the sample.

Lowering the sample temperature from RT to ~ 5. 5 K significantly enhanced the fluorescence intensity and spectral resolution of both the minerals and sediments, offering improved possibilities for identifying uranyl species in environmental samples. At 5. 5 K, all of the uranyl silicates showed unique, well-resolved fluorescence spectra. The symmetric O = U = O stretching frequency, as determined from the peak spacing of the vibronic bands in the emission spectra, were between 705 to 823 cm− 1 for the uranyl silicates. These were lower than those reported for uranyl phosphate, carbonate, or oxy-hydroxides. The fluorescence emission spectra of all four sediment samples were similar to each other. Their spectra shifted minimally at different time delays or upon contact with basic Na/Ca-carbonate electrolyte solutions that dissolved up to 60 % of the precipitated U(VI) pool. The well-resolved vibronic peaks in the fluorescence spectra of the sediments indicated that the major fluorescence species was a crystalline uranyl mineral phase, while the peak spacing of the vibronic bands pointed to the likely presence of uranyl silicate. Although an exact match was not found between the U(VI) fluorescence spectra of the sediments with that of any individual uranyl silicates, the major spectral characteristics indicated that the sediment U(VI) was a uranophane-type solid (<b>uranophane,</b> boltwoodite) or soddyite, as was concluded from microprobe, EXAFS, and solubility analyses...|$|E
