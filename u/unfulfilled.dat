5|$|A Moral Reckoning: The Role of the Catholic Church in the Holocaust and Its <b>Unfulfilled</b> Duty of Repair is a 2003 book by Daniel Jonah Goldhagen, {{previously}} {{the author}} or Hitler's Willing Executioners (1996). Goldhagen examines the Roman Catholic Church's {{role in the}} Holocaust, and offers a review of scholarship in English addressing what he argues is antisemitism {{throughout the history of}} the Church, which he claims contributed substantially to the persecution of the Jews during World War II.|$|E
5|$|As {{the poem}} continues, the narrator begins to focus {{less on the}} {{countryside}} and more on his immediate surroundings. His descriptions move from sensations to his own thoughts as he begins to emphasise what is not present in the scene; he contrasts an obscure country life with a life that is remembered. This contemplation provokes the narrator's thoughts on the natural process of wastage and <b>unfulfilled</b> potential.|$|E

5|$|Giles' dream {{presents}} a choice: either {{to remain a}} father figure and Watcher to Buffy, or to begin his own life, represented {{by the presence of}} his girlfriend Olivia, who pushes an empty baby stroller. During this part of his dream, Buffy is dressed as a child, with pigtails, and is unable to throw a ball straight without his help and instruction, an indication of his fear that she will be unable to do her job without his guidance. Later, Olivia is seen weeping, while the baby stroller has been overturned and abandoned, signifying elements of his <b>unfulfilled</b> life, such as marriage and children. Later, in The Bronze, he is explaining the reason they are all being stalked and attacked, performing his job as Watcher, but his singing this information represents his <b>unfulfilled</b> longing to be a musician, something he's been exploring privately throughout the season.|$|E
5|$|In a follow-up, to meet Specification O.21/44 for a two-seat strike fighter, the Spearfish was {{redesigned}} {{to accommodate}} a twin-coupled Rolls-Royce Merlin engine and contra-rotating propellers. A variety of other engines were considered and although a production order was placed for three examples in 1944, the programme was eventually shelved, remaining as an <b>unfulfilled</b> paper project.|$|E
5|$|On 30 March, Nasser proclaimed a {{manifesto}} stipulating {{the restoration of}} civil liberties, greater parliamentary independence from the executive, major structural changes to the ASU, and a campaign to rid the government of corrupt elements. A public referendum approved the proposed measures in May, and held subsequent elections for the Supreme Executive Committee, the ASU's highest decision-making body. Observers noted that the declaration signaled an important shift from political repression to liberalization, although its promises would largely go <b>unfulfilled.</b>|$|E

But, his {{ambition}} <b>unfulfilled,</b> {{he took a job}} with his uncle when he was 17, working as a sales assistant at Hepworths, Milford Haven; a high street tailor that would form the foundation of the Next retail empire. In the early 1980s, he became interested in the club scene, often driving to London, where he mixed with New Romantics such as Boy George at The Blitz; a trendy London nightclub run by Steve Strange of the group Visage.|$|E
5|$|Machine Head {{was formed}} when Flynn felt musically <b>unfulfilled</b> with his bands Forbidden and Vio-lence and {{requested}} {{to start a}} side project. When his request was denied, he left the band and formed Machine Head in 1991 with Duce, Logan Mader and Tony Constanza. The band's first album, Burn My Eyes, was a big success in Europe where it garnered attention on MTV's Headbangers Ball. In America (with HBB taken off the air during the grunge movement) Machine Head would not have success until later albums.|$|E
5|$|Contemporaries {{regarded}} Organt {{as something}} of a salacious novelty and it was quickly banned, but censors who tried to confiscate it discovered that few copies were available anywhere. It did not sell well and resulted in a financial loss for its author. The public's taste for literature had changed in the prelude to the Revolution, and Saint-Just's taste changed with it: aside from a few pages of an unfinished novel found amidst his papers {{at the end of his}} life, Saint-Just devoted his future writing entirely to undecorated essays of social and political theory. With his previous ambitions of literary and lawyerly fame <b>unfulfilled,</b> Saint-Just directed his focus on the single goal of revolutionary command.|$|E

5|$|Griffin {{designed}} the lake with many geometric motifs, {{so that the}} axes of his design lined up with natural geographical landmarks in the area. However, government authorities changed his original plans and no substantial work was completed before he left Australia in 1920. His scheme remained <b>unfulfilled</b> as the Great Depression and World War II intervened, {{and it was not}} until the 1950s that planning resumed. After much political dispute over several proposed variations, excavation work began in 1960 with the energetic backing of Prime Minister Robert Menzies. After the completion of the bridges and dams, the dams were locked in September 1963. However, a drought meant that the target water level was not reached until April 1964. It was formally inaugurated on 17 October 1964.|$|E
5|$|Hancock's General Order Number 40 {{was quickly}} {{condemned}} by Republicans in Washington, especially by the Radicals, while President Johnson wholeheartedly approved. Heedless {{of the situation}} in Washington, Hancock soon put his words into action, refusing local Republican politicians' requests to use his power to overturn elections and court verdicts, while also letting it be known that open insurrection would be suppressed. Hancock's popularity within the Democratic party grew {{to the extent that he}} was considered a potential presidential nominee for that party in the 1868 election. Although Hancock collected a significant number of delegates at the 1868 convention, his presidential possibilities went <b>unfulfilled.</b> Even so, he was henceforth identified as a rare breed in politics: one who believed in the Democratic Party's principles of states' rights and limited government, but whose anti-secessionist sentiment was unimpeachable.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the end of the war, Cilicia had also become a source of dispute between the British and French, who both aspired to establish influence in the region. The British government, however, was under strong domestic pressure to withdraw and demobilize its forces in the Middle East and on 15 September 1919, Prime Minister David Lloyd George begrudgingly accepted a proposal by Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau to have the French formally assume control of Cilicia. The transfer of command took place on 4 November, but Field Marshal Ferdinand Foch's promise to reinforce the existing forces in the area with at least 32 infantry battalions, 20 cavalry squadrons and 14 artillery batteries went <b>unfulfilled.</b> The French units were thus deprived of armored cars and air support and lacked automatic weapons, heavy artillery and even wireless transmitters and carrier pigeons.|$|E

5|$|On 30 May 1918, the Allies {{launched}} an offensive on the heavily fortified Skra salient, commencing {{the battle of}} Skra-di-Legen. Utilizing the cover of heavy artillery a Franco-Hellenic force made a rapid push into the enemy trenches, conquering Skra and the surrounding system of fortifications. Greek casualties amounted to 434–440 killed in action, 154–164 missing in action and 1,974–2,220 wounded, France lost approximately 150 men killed or injured. A total of 1,782 soldiers of the Central Powers became prisoners of war, including {{a small number of}} German engineers and artillery specialists that served in Bulgarian units; considerable amounts of military equipment also fell into Entente hands. The plan for a Bulgarian counterattack against Skra remained <b>unfulfilled</b> as the Bulgarian soldiers refused {{to take part in the}} operation. Both the Greek and the French press used the opportunity to extol the efforts of the Greek army, favorably influencing the Greek mobilization.|$|E
5|$|The {{impending}} {{dinner with}} Mr. Burns divides the Simpson household. Homer pragmatically supports Mr. Burns, while Marge and Lisa oppose him. Before the dinner arrives, Mr. Burns's advisers prepare {{the family for}} the event, even giving them pre-written questions to ask in lieu of conversation. Lisa becomes disillusioned by it all, but Marge tells her not to worry. To everyone's surprise, Marge serves Blinky for dinner. Mr. Burns tries {{to act as if}} it does not bother him, but is not able to keep from spitting it out. The cameras flash as the bite flies through the air, {{and by the time the}} chunk hits the floor the press is gone and his governatorial campaign dissolves. Bailey wins the election and, despite Mr. Burns saying that Homer's dreams will be <b>unfulfilled</b> for as long as he is alive, the Simpson family happily get together again.|$|E
5|$|Some authors like Boog and Lewin opine {{that while}} Creveld's {{statistics}} regarding the losses of supplies are not wrong {{and that the}} vast distances were a big problem, {{the failure of the}} seaborne supply lines was still a deciding factor because operationally effective supplies often failed to arrive at decisive moments of the campaigns. Douglas Austin points out that the overall port capacity at Tobruk and Benghazi was actually sufficient and that the recently published Enigma intercepts show that it was the bulk losses at sea (and not unloading or getting the supplies to forward areas) that had the greater impact on Rommel's decisions {{as well as those of}} other German commanders, like Kesselring. Levine dismisses poor port capacity and lack of transport vehicles as the Afrika Korps' crucial weaknesses, citing evidences gathered on British intelligence by Hinsley and Bennett. Others point out Rommel's dependence on captured resources as compensation for the unstable supply lines and <b>unfulfilled</b> promises (by 1942, 85% of his transport were captured vehicles). Butler opines that the myth of Rommel's bad logistical management is the result of rumours started by Halder.|$|E
25|$|After the war, O'Ferrall {{returned}} {{to run the}} family's inn, though he found this both personally and financially <b>unfulfilling.</b> He decided to pursue a law degree at Washington College (later Washington and Lee University).

5|$|The Greenbackers {{nominated}} Weaver {{for president}} in 1880, but he received only 3.3 {{percent of the popular}} vote. After several more attempts at elected office, he was again elected to the House in 1884 and 1886. In Congress, he worked for expansion of the money supply and for the opening of Indian Territory to white settlement. As the Greenback Party fell apart, a new anti-big business third party, the People's Party ("Populists"), arose. Weaver helped to organize the party and was their nominee {{for president in}} 1892. This time he was more successful and gained 8.5 {{percent of the popular vote}} and won five states, but still fell far short of victory. The Populists merged with the Democrats by the end of the 19th century, and Weaver went with them, promoting the candidacy of William Jennings Bryan for president in 1896, 1900, and 1908. After serving as mayor of his home town, Colfax, Iowa, Weaver retired from his pursuit of elective office. He died in Iowa in 1912. Most of Weaver's political goals remained <b>unfulfilled</b> at his death, but many came to pass in the following decades.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} occurred {{during a period}} of popular unrest by the Buddhist majority against the Roman Catholic rule of Diệm. Buddhist discontent had grown since the Huế Phật Đản shootings on May 8, 1963. The government decided to selectively invoke a law, prohibiting the display of religious flags, by banning the use of the Buddhist flag on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha. One week earlier, the Vatican flag had been flown at a celebration for Archbishop Ngô Đình Thục, Diệm's brother. The Buddhists defied the ban, flying their flags on Vesak and holding a demonstration, which was ended with government gunfire and eight deaths. The killings sparked nationwide protests by South Vietnam's Buddhist majority against the policies of Diệm's regime. The Buddhists demanded that Diệm give them religious equality, but with their demands <b>unfulfilled,</b> the protests increased in magnitude. The most notable of these was the self-immolation of Thích Quảng Đức on June 11, which was iconically photographed by the media and became a negative symbol of the Diệm régime.|$|E
5|$|The {{surge of}} German nationalism, {{stimulated by the}} {{experience}} of Germans in the Napoleonic period and initially allied with liberalism, shifted political, social, and cultural relationships within the German states. In this context, one can detect {{its roots in the}} experience of Germans in the Napoleonic period. The Burschenschaft student organizations and popular demonstrations, such as those held at Wartburg Castle in October 1817, contributed to a growing sense of unity among German speakers of Central Europe. Furthermore, implicit and sometimes explicit promises made during the War of Liberation engendered an expectation of popular sovereignty and widespread participation in the political process, promises that largely went <b>unfulfilled</b> once peace had been achieved. Agitation by student organizations led such conservative leaders as Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich, to fear the rise of national sentiment; the assassination of German dramatist August von Kotzebue in March 1819 by a radical student seeking unification was followed on 20 September 1819 by the proclamation of the Carlsbad Decrees, which hampered intellectual leadership of the nationalist movement.|$|E
