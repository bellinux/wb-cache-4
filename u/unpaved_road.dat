5|$|Wilkins Peak is not gated, {{and it can}} {{be reached}} via an <b>unpaved</b> <b>road</b> known as Wilkins Peak Road that starts on U.S. Route 191 {{southwest}} of Rock Springs, Wyoming. The mountain can also be accessed via another <b>unpaved</b> <b>road</b> that begins in the Scott's Bottom Nature Area in Green River, Wyoming. The peak is accessible year-round, weather permitting. The Green River access road is in worse shape than the Rock Springs side, and it has several road hazards such as steep grades, poor grading, and off-road vehicle traffic. Along with serving radio needs, the peak also is a popular hiking and mountain biking location in the area. There are many smaller roads and trails that spring from the peak that offer varied degrees of challenge.|$|E
40|$|The Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 require {{emission}} inventories {{be constructed}} for every area in nonattainment {{of any of}} six criteria pollutants, including particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 10 mm (PM 10). An essential component in building mobile emissions inventories is an accurate estimation of vehicular traffic; in California, one particularly important source of PM 10 is vehicle activity on <b>unpaved</b> <b>roads.</b> To develop a statewide estimate of VMT on <b>unpaved</b> <b>roads,</b> this research expands upon a pilot study developed to estimate VMT on <b>unpaved</b> <b>roads</b> for two counties in the San Joaquin Valley. Research to date indicates that the current method used by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) overestimates annual VMT on <b>unpaved</b> <b>roads,</b> particularly VMT attributable to agricultural harvest activities.

5|$|When routes were legislated in Pennsylvania in 1911, {{what is now}} PA 997 {{between the}} Maryland border and Waynesboro was {{designated}} as part of Legislative Route 44 while {{a section of the}} current route south of Roxbury became part of Legislative Route 264. At this time, an <b>unpaved</b> <b>road</b> ran between Waynesboro, Mont Alto, and Fayetteville. PA 997 was signed in 1928 from Mont Alto, where an unnumbered paved road continued south to Waynesboro, north to US 30 in Fayetteville, following Mont Alto Road. Upon designation, the entire length of PA 997 was paved. The present route between the Maryland border and Waynesboro was designated as part of PA 316, which was paved, while PA 433 was designated onto the <b>unpaved</b> <b>road</b> between Lurgan and Roxbury. PA 333 was designated in 1928 to run from US 30 in Chambersburg northeast to US 11 in Shippensburg, heading north on North Franklin Street and Letterkenny Road to Pleasant Hall before heading west to Upper Strasburg, northeast to Roxbury, east to Newburg, and south to Shippensburg. Upon designation, PA 333 was paved between Chambersburg and Pleasant Hall and Newburg and Shippensburg and was unpaved between Pleasant Hall and Newburg. On February 25, 1929, a bill passed that authorized the state to take over the road between Newburg and McCrea. By 1930, PA 997 was extended south from Mont Alto to PA 16 in Waynesboro, following a paved road. The same year, PA 333 was shifted east to a more direct alignment between Pleasant Hall and Roxbury that was under construction, running concurrent with PA 433 between Lurgan and Roxbury, while PA 996 was designated onto the paved road between Scotland and US 11 in Green Village. The former alignment of PA 333 became PA 633 (now PA 533) between Pleasant Hall and Upper Strasburg and an unnumbered road between Upper Strasburg and Roxbury. At this time, the road between Mont Alto and Scotland was an unnumbered, <b>unpaved</b> <b>road,</b> the road between Green Village and Culbertson was an unnumbered, paved road, and the road between Roxbury and McCrea was an unnumbered, <b>unpaved</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E
5|$|The second {{iteration}} has {{its origins}} with {{the formation of}} US-6. In 1937, US-6 was extended west from its former terminus at Greeley, Colorado to Long Beach, California. In eastern Utah the route used the existing alignment of US-50. However, in western Utah the route used an <b>unpaved</b> <b>road</b> through Delta reconnecting with US-50 in Ely. By 1954, this route was fully paved and US-50 was moved to this shorter alignment. With this change US-6/50 ran concurrent from Ely to Grand Junction, Colorado.|$|E
5|$|What is now MS 5 {{originally}} existed as an unnumbered <b>unpaved</b> <b>road</b> by 1928. The MS 5 designation {{was assigned}} by 1932 {{for the road}} running from US 78 in Hickory Flat to the Tennessee border in Michigan City, where it connected to SR 18. This road was a gravel road south of Ashland and an earth road north of Ashland. Two years later, the portion north of Ashland became a gravel road. In 1943, the northern terminus of MS 5 was cut back to its current location at US 72, with MS 7 connecting to SR 18 at the Tennessee border. By 1948, the portion of route south of Ashland was paved. The remainder of the route was paved three years later. Since then, the route has not undergone any alignment changes.|$|E

40|$|<b>Unpaved</b> <b>roads</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{relevant}} causes of erosion process in rural regions. Locating <b>unpaved</b> <b>roads</b> in low-resolution satellite images is not a trivial task. Although they have the spectral response of bare soil, their spatial width is often far below the pixel size. Therefore, the pixels crossed by <b>unpaved</b> <b>roads</b> have a different spectral response over the scene depending on the surrounding pixels. In this work, a new method to detect sub-pixel <b>unpaved</b> <b>roads</b> is proposed. The method tries to emulate the human ability to detect such roads in spite of all appointed aspects, by searching for long, narrow and smooth line segments whose spectral response are closer to the bare soil than the surrounding pixels.

5|$|SR104 was {{established}} during the 1964 state highway renumbering as {{the successor to}} several state highways: SSH9E between Discovery Bay and Port Gamble, PSH21 between Port Gamble and Kingston, SSH1W in Edmonds, and SSH2B between Edmonds and Lake Forest Park. The highway between Port Gamble and Kingston {{was established}} in 1915 as part of State Road21, which extended south to Bremerton. During {{the creation of the}} Primary and secondary state highways in 1937, State Road21 was re-designated as PSH21 and extended south to Gorst. SSH9E was also established, connecting US101 and PSH9 in Discovery Bay to Port Ludlow, along with SSH1W from US99 and PSH1 in Lynnwood through Edmonds to US99 and PSH1 in Woodway, following the route of an <b>unpaved</b> <b>road</b> built in the 1890s. SSH2B was created in 1937 to serve as a connector between US99 and PSH1 in Shoreline to a branch of PSH2 in Lake Forest Park.|$|E
5|$|The Apache Trail {{connected}} the Old Spanish Trail where Apache Junction is today and Roosevelt Lake with an <b>unpaved</b> <b>road</b> {{as early as}} 1925, following much of the modern route. By the next year, SR 66 followed the Apache Trail and the Old Spanish Trail was numbered as US 80. The number 88 {{was given to the}} route by 1927, but continued past its current terminus east to US 180 west of Globe. US 60 and US 89 became concurrent with US 80 at the western terminus by 1935, and the US 70 designation was added to the road by 1939. The section of the route from Apache Junction to Canyon Lake was paved in the late 1940s. By 1958, the section east of Roosevelt Dam was paved. The extra designations at SR 88's western terminus were removed by 1971, leaving only the US 60 designation. In 1999, the section east of Roosevelt Dam was renumbered as SR 188, cutting SR 88 back to its current terminus.|$|E
5|$|MD 5 was {{designated}} in 1927 {{to the state}} highway between north of Point Lookout and the Washington, D.C. border, passing through Leonardtown, Hughesville, and Waldorf. MD 5 ran concurrent with MD 3 (now US 301) between Waldorf and TB. In 1928, the route was paved between north of TB and Camp Springs. By 1933, MD 5 was paved between northwest of Leonardtown and north of Morganza and along the MD 3 concurrency between Waldorf and the Charles-Prince George's county border. Also, the route was extended south along an <b>unpaved</b> <b>road</b> into Point Lookout State Park. In 1939, MD 5 was rerouted to follow Naylor Road to the Washington, D.C. border while the portion of Branch Avenue leading to the border {{was designated}} as MD 637. DC 5 continued into Washington, D.C. along Naylor Road, Good Hope Road, and 11th Street SE to DC 4 (Pennsylvania Avenue SE). By this time, the section of route between Hughesville and Waldorf was paved while the section between Point Lookout and Leonardtown was a bituminous road. By 1946, MD 5 was paved between Great Mills and Leonardtown. Also, DC 5 was extended to follow DC 4 along Pennsylvania Avenue to US 1 and US 240 at {{the east side of}} the White House. In 1949, the DC 5 designation was decommissioned.|$|E
40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{pinpoint}} the sources of sediment pollution in Lake Victoria, the contribution of sediment from compounds, landing sites, <b>unpaved</b> <b>roads</b> and footpaths is determined in the catchment of Nabera Bay and Kafunda Bay at the northern shore of Lake Victoria in southern Uganda. The volume of soil loss is determined in 36 compounds, 1 school and 1 landing site by comparing the original and current soil surface. The original soil surface is reconstructed using botanical and man-made datable objects. The soil loss rates are calculated by dividing the eroded soil volume {{by the age of}} the oldest datable object. Considering all compounds and landing sites in the study area, the average soil loss rate in compounds amounts to 107 Mg ha‚àí 1 year‚àí 1 (per unit compound) and to 207 Mg ha‚àí 1 year‚àí 1 per unit landing site. The soil loss from footpaths and <b>unpaved</b> <b>roads</b> is calculated by multiplying the total length of footpaths and <b>unpaved</b> <b>roads</b> with the average width and soil loss depth. The mean soil loss rate on footpaths is 34 Mg ha‚àí 1 year‚àí 1 and on <b>unpaved</b> <b>roads</b> equals 35 Mg ha‚àí 1 year‚àí 1. Compounds, landing sites, footpaths and <b>unpaved</b> <b>roads</b> occupy {{a small fraction of the}} study area (2. 2 %), but contribute disproportionately to the total soil loss (i. e. 85 %) in the study area. It is concluded that compounds, landing sites, footpaths and <b>unpaved</b> <b>roads</b> are very significant sources of sediment pollution to Lake Victoria. This needs to be considered when designing strategies to reduce sediment production in the area. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|The state sign route {{system was}} {{established}} in 1934, {{but the majority of}} Route 33 did not receive a state route designation, instead becoming part of the new U.S. Route 466. However, US 466 turned southwest from Cholame Pass along Legislative Route 125 (modern SR 41) to Morro Bay. Sign Route 41, which followed Legislative Route 125 northeast of Cholame, continued along Route 33 west to the coast. However, Route 125 had still not been paved between Cholame and Atascadero by the 1950s, and so US 466 was moved to the longer but better-quality Route 33 via Paso Robles, replacing SR 41 to Paso Robles and overlapping US 101 to Atascadero. As SR 41 had not been signed over the <b>unpaved</b> <b>road</b> west of Paso Robles, it was truncated to Cholame. US 466 was eliminated in the 1964 renumbering, becoming SR 46 east from Paso Robles. However, instead of going south and west to Morro Bay, SR 46 continued west to Cambria, and the road via Creston and Atascadero to Morro Bay (which had since been paved) became part of SR 41. A new two-lane expressway carrying SR 46 west from Paso Robles was built in the mid-1970s, replacing Santa Rosa Creek Road.|$|E
