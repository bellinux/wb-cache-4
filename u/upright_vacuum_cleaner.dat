5000|$|Even though market {{research}} showed that people wouldn’t {{be happy with}} a transparent container for the dust, Dyson and his team {{decided to make a}} transparent container anyway and {{this turned out to be}} a popular and enduring feature which has been heavily copied. The DC01 became the biggest selling vacuum cleaner in the UK in just 18 months. By 2001, the DC01 made up 47% of the <b>upright</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> market.The company introduced a cylinder machine, the DC02, and produced a number of special editions and revised models (DC02 Absolute, DC02 De Stijl, DC05, DC04, DC06, DC04 Zorbster). On 2 January 2001 the company name was shortened from Dyson Appliances Ltd. to simply Dyson Ltd. In April of that year the DC07, a new <b>upright</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> using [...] "Root Cyclone" [...] technology with seven cyclone funnels instead of the original dual-cyclone design, was launched. By 2009 Dyson began creating other technologies: the AirBlade hand dryer, the Air Multiplier [...] "bladeless" [...] fan and Dyson Hot, the [...] "bladeless" [...] fan heater.|$|E
50|$|SEBO was {{established}} in 1978 by two German engineers, Klaus Stein and Heinz Kaulig, who were seeking to build a reliable, powerful {{and easy to use}} commercial <b>upright</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner.</b> Klaus Stein had previously worked at Vorwerk, the manufacturer of the Kobold vacuum cleaner since 1929. The first SEBO factory was located in Dannenberg, West Germany in a disused weaving factory where they developed in 1978 the SEBO 350 upright commercial vacuum cleaner.|$|E

50|$|<b>Upright</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> {{are popular}} in the United States, Britain and {{numerous}} Commonwealth countries, but very unusual in Continental Europe. They {{take the form of}} a cleaning head, onto which a handle and bag are attached. Upright designs generally employ a rotating brushroll or beater bar, which removes dirt through a combination of sweeping and vibration. There are two types of upright vacuums; dirty-air/direct fan (found mostly on commercial vacuums), or clean-air/fan-bypass (found on most of today's domestic vacuums).|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} <b>upright</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> use a {{drive-belt}} {{powered by the}} suction motor to rotate the brush-roll. However, a more common design of dual motor upright is available. In these cleaners, the suction is provided via a large motor, while the brushroll {{is powered by a}} separate, smaller motor, which does not create any suction. The brush-roll motor can sometimes be switched off, so hard floors can be cleaned without the brush-roll scattering the dirt. It may also have an automatic cut-off feature which shuts the motor off if the brush-roll becomes jammed, protecting it from damage.|$|R

50|$|The first <b>upright</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> {{was invented}} in June 1908 by Canton, Ohio {{department}} store janitor and occasional inventor James Murray Spangler (1848-1915). Spangler was an asthmatic, and suspecting the carpet sweeper he was using at work {{was the cause of}} his ailment, he created a basic suction-sweeper by mounting an electric fan motor on a Bissell brand carpet sweeper then adding a soap box and a broom handle. After refining the design and obtaining a patent for the Electric Suction Sweeper he set about producing it himself, assisted by his son, who helped him assemble the machines, and his daughter, who assembled the dust bags. Production was slow, just two to three machines completed a week.|$|E
50|$|As radio grew in {{popularity}} in the 1920s, gramophone sales dropped precipitously. This dire situation {{gave rise to the}} birth of the “Vorwerk Kobold” in 1929: chief engineer Engelbert Gorissen developed out of a gramophone motor a high-performance electric <b>upright</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner.</b> On 25 May 1930, a patent was granted for the Kobold “Model 30”. At first, sales of what was at the time a completely unknown appliance in Germany were very poor, despite the relatively modest price of 20 Reichsmarks. Only when direct sales were launched in 1930 - the brainchild of Werner Mittelsten Scheid (1904-1953), a son of the company founder - did the product meet with success. By 1935, 100,000 “Kobolds” had been sold, by 1937 half a million and by 1953 one million. Already before the Second World War, in 1938, the first foreign sales organization was established: Vorwerk Folletto in Italy.|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} of a drum-style pulley, without a groove or flanges, the pulley often is {{slightly}} convex to keep the flat belt centred. It is sometimes referred to as a crowned pulley. Though once widely used on factory line shafts, this type of pulley is still found driving the rotating brush in <b>upright</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners,</b> in belt sanders and bandsaws. Agricultural tractors built up to the early 1950s generally had a belt pulley for a flat belt (which is what Belt Pulley magazine was named after). It has been replaced by other mechanisms with more flexibility in methods of use, such as power take-off and hydraulics.|$|R
50|$|Closely {{resembling}} a large <b>upright,</b> wide-based <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> with handlebar controls and requiring two-handed steering, a floor buffer uses {{one or more}} variable-speed circular rotary brushes to dislodge dirt and dust from flat surfaces. They have a large, round scrubbing pad which is spun in one direction by a small motor, usually mounted directly over {{the center of the}} pad.|$|R
5000|$|The 350 {{was their}} first <b>upright</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> and it was {{engineered}} for commercial uses. The company understood that most cleaning staff weren't motivated to perform simple maintenance or {{be concerned about the}} operational status of the machine; their job was to clean the floor and their employer provided a machine so that they could do their job. If the machine was [...] "complicated" [...] for the employee to use, then the machine isn't any good. They still had to vacuum, but didn't care that the machine needed the disposable filter bag to be changed, readjusted for different floor surfaces, or that there was a clog somewhere. With that in mind, it offered a degree of functionality that didn't require the user to read an operations manual before using. It was equipped with a commercial-grade motor that could run continuously for 1000 hours or 41 days. The 350 was designed to pass the hardest test; to survive the abuse and neglect of cleaning professionals.|$|E
5000|$|Hoover's {{business}} {{began to}} flourish, and, {{a year after}} Hoover acquired the patent from Spangler, he established a research and development department for his new business. By 1926, Hoover had developed the 'beater bar' - a metal bar attached to the rotating brush roll, situated in the floor nozzle cavity of the <b>upright</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner.</b> [...] Introduced on Models 543 and 700, the beater bars alternated with the sweeping brushes to vibrate the carpet while sucking. It provided a more distinct 'tap' than the bristle tufts used on the former machines, {{and led to a}} 101% increase in efficiency. This cleaning action was marketed by Hoover as [...] "Positive Agitation". 'It Beats...as it Sweeps...as it Cleans' rang more true now than ever. In 1929, Hoover introduced the Model 200 Duster. This would be their first attempt at a cylinder cleaner. It used a Model 575 motor with a modified suction impeller, which was mounted on a unique aluminum body with runners, allowing the cleaner to be pulled behind the user. The Duster was produced for only three months and roughly 9,000 were made.|$|E
5000|$|In 1906 James B. Kirby {{developed}} his {{first of many}} vacuums called the [...] "Domestic Cyclone". It used water for dirt separation. Later revisions {{came to be known}} as the Kirby Vacuum Cleaner. In 1907 department store janitor James Murray Spangler (1848-1915) of Canton, Ohio invented the first portable electric vacuum cleaner, obtaining a patent for the Electric Suction Sweeper on June 2, 1908. Crucially, in addition to suction from an electric fan that blew the dirt and dust into a soap box and one of his wife's pillow cases, Spangler's design utilized a rotating brush to loosen debris. Unable to produce the design himself due to lack of funding, he sold the patent in 1908 to local leather goods manufacturer William Henry Hoover (1849-1932), who had Spangler's machine redesigned with a steel casing, casters, and attachments, founding the company that in 1922 was renamed the Hoover Company. Their first vacuum was the 1908 Model O, which sold for $60. Subsequent innovations included the beater bar in 1919 ("It beats as it sweeps as it cleans"), disposal filter bags in the 1920s, and an <b>upright</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> in 1926.|$|E
50|$|After the Southcorp takeover, {{a culture}} of fear was {{introduced}} based on a widespread campaign to strip all the indirect labour from the workforce, and a myth that the factory was inefficient and unproductive. Every month it was reported the factory was losing $1 million or more. Morale at the factory went into a downward spiral. This was followed by decisions to stop production of barrel and <b>upright</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners,</b> next {{was the end of}} the front loader washing machine. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> and front loaders were replaced with imported products, the plastic moulding production was contracted out, the factory was being stripped of production, volume and jobs. A cost reduction campaign followed with good quality components being replaced by inferior cheap components and a complete breakdown of any real preventative maintenance program, which gave way to a large number of machine and equipment breakdowns. The reality, rather than the myth, was the Hoover Meadowbank site was being run into the ground by corporate decisions.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{efficiency}} (dust {{collection and}} recirculation) {{of a conventional}} <b>upright</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> with a prototype vacuum bag (I) with pore size of 0 · 1 μm was compared with a standard vacuum cleaner bag (II), {{in the homes of}} 11 atopic asthmatic subjects with a known allergy to house dust mite. Four filter vacuum cleaners were assessed in pairs — the Vax 2000 with the Vorwerk VK 121 ET 340 (in 10 homes), and the Nilfisk GS 90 ‘Allergy Vac’ with the Bosch maxima 43 (in nine homes). All of the selected homes were vacuumed throughout (carpets and soft furnishings) for a 15 min period with each of the cleaners, and air was sampled simultaneously at 21 min− 1 (Casella personal sampler). The weight of dust retrieved was recorded, and a sample of sieved dust (2 g) and the air filters were extracted to determine the concentrations of the major allergen, Der pI, by ELISA (ALK). No significant difference was observed in either total weight of dust, or airborne and dust concentrations of Der pI between using the conventional cleaner with vacuum bags I, or vacuum bags II. The Vax and the Vorwerk filter vacuum cleaners produced no measurable airborne Der pI concentrations during use in any of the 10 homes tested, whilst the Nilfisk produced airborne Der pI in two, and the Bosch in one of the nine homes tested. The Vorwerk retrieved significantly more dust from the floors than the Vax (P< 0 · 002). There {{was no significant difference in}} dust retrieval between the Nilfisk and the Bosch. All of the filter vacuum cleaners investigated produced lower concentrations of airborne Der pI, compared to the conventional cleaner with or without a special dust bag. However, the amount of dust and concentration/amount of Der pI that these cleaners actually retrieved, varied and the Vorwerk appeared most effective overall...|$|E
40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis is directed towards the reduction of noise levels in the Hoover Turbopower <b>upright</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner.</b> The experimental work embodies a study of such factors as the application of noise source identification techniques, investigation of the noise generating principles for each major source and evaluation of the noise reducing treatments. It {{was found that the}} design of the vacuum cleaner had not been optimised from the standpoint of noise emission. Important factors such as noise `windows', isolation of vibration at the source, panel rattle, resonances and critical speeds had not been considered. Therefore, a number of experimentally validated treatments are proposed. Their noise reduction benefit together with material and tooling costs are presented. The solutions to the noise problems were evaluated on a standard Turbopower and the sound power level of the cleaner was reduced from 87. 5 dB(A) to 80. 4 db(A) at a cost of 93. 6 pence per cleaner. The designers' lack of experience in noise reduction was identified as one of the factors for the low priority given to noise during design of the cleaner. Consequently, the fundamentals of acoustics, principles of noise prediction and absorption and guidelines for good acoustical design were collated into a Handbook and circulated at Hoover plc. Mechanical variations during production of the motor and the cleaner were found to be important. These caused a vast spread in the noise levels of the cleaners. Subsequently, the manufacturing processes were briefly studied to identify their source and recommendations for improvement are made. Noise of a product is quality related and a high level of noise {{is considered to be a}} bad feature. This project suggested that the noise level be used constructively both as a test on the production line to identify cleaners above a certain noise level and also to promote the product by `designing' the characteristics of the sound so that the appliance is pleasant to the user. This project showed that good noise control principles should be implemented early in the design stage. As yet there are no mandatory noise limits or noise-labelling requirements for household appliances. However, the literature suggests that noise-labelling is likely in the near future and the requirement will be to display the A-weighted sound power level. However, the `noys' scale of perceived noisiness was found more appropriate to the rating of appliance noise both as it is linear and therefore, a sound level that seems twice as loud is twice the value in noys and also takes into consideration the presence of pure tones, which even in the absence of a high noise level can lead to annoyance...|$|E

Hess received a patent (U.S. patent #29,077) for his invention of the first <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> on July 10, 1860.
