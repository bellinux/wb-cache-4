Here we analyse the relationships between migrations and urbanisation by using a panel of ca 200 countries over the period 1960 - 2010. We describe the main global stylised facts on urbanisation and international migrations focusing on differences in these across world regions. We found that while there was a positive association between immigration and urbanisation, particularly in small and medium-sized cities, the association between emigration and urbanisation in developing countries was inverse. Both associations have become stronger over the few past decades, and our results highlight that international migration is an increasingly relevant and complementary dimension of the traditional rural-urban reallocation of workers which takes place during economic development...|$|R

The 1970 - 2000 period was investigated by using a gravitational model and estimates were obtained by using a a wide fixed-effects structure. The main finding was that changes in urbanisation matter more as a pull factor than changes in GDP per capita. This may be linked to the existence of greater opportunities arising in growing cities and to {{the fact that in the}} period of analysis these opportunities had been more important in small and medium sized cities than in large cities. In addition, it appears that immigrants not only look for monetary outcomes by migrating, but also cue on non-economic territorial features...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Urban sprawl {{refers to}} the {{outgrowth}} of urban areas caused by uncontrolled, uncoordinated and unplanned growth. This outgrowth seen along the periphery of cities, along highways, and along roads connecting a city, lacks basic amenities like sanitation, treated water supply, primary health centre, etc. as planners were unable to visualise such growth during planning, policy and decision-making. Sprawl generally infers to some type of uncoordinated development with impacts such as loss of agricultural land, open space and ecologically sensitive habitats in and around urban areas {{due to lack of}} integrated and holistic approaches in regional planning. In developing countries, where <b>urbanisation</b> <b>rates</b> are high, urban sprawl is a significant contributor of the land use change. However, characterising sprawl has become a contentious issue with numerous arguments both for and against the phenomenon. Meanwhile, effective metrics to characterise sprawl in India are required to characterise this. We have attempted to capture urban sprawl over the landscape and hence adopt landscape metrics for characterising sprawl. We further ascribe that prevalence of sprawl leads to erosion of landscape elements. Th...|$|R
