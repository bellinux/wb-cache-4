An article in Macworld praised the update and especially the new editing features, but said it had some quirks, such as a difficult-to-find Edit button. Some of the iHome software, which plays video content from a computer onto a television, was released in 2006 as a universal binary.|$|E

5|$|Marco Pesenti Gritti, the {{initiator}} of Galeon, {{originally developed}} Epiphany in 2002 as a fork of Galeon. The fork occurred {{because of the}} divergent aims of Gritti {{and the rest of}} Galeon development team about new features. While Gritti regarded Galeon's monolithic design and the number of user-configurable features as factors limiting Galeon's maintainability and user base expansion, the rest of the Galeon developers wanted to see more features added. At the same time the GNOME project created the GNOME human interface guidelines, which promoted simplification of user interfaces. As Galeon was oriented towards power users, most developers saw the implementation of those guidelines as unacceptable. As a result, Gritti created a new browser based on Galeon's codebase, with most of the non-mission-critical features removed. He intended Epiphany to comply fully with the GNOME human interface guidelines, with a very simple <b>user-interface.</b> As such, Epiphany does not have its own theme settings and uses GNOME's settings, which are specified in the GNOME Control Center.|$|E

40|$|A {{framework}} for <b>user-interfaces</b> to databases (IDSs) is proposed which draws from existing research on human computer interaction (HCI) and database systems. The framework {{is described in}} terms of a classification of the characteristic components of an IDS. These components, when progressively refined, may be mapped to a conceptual object-oriented language for the precise specification of the IDS. A prototype system is presented, showing the potential for automated mapping of a language specification to a fully functional implementation. As well as providing general support to any database interface developer, we believe that the framework will prove useful for researching a number of IDS issues.

25|$|Given that {{creating}} an OpenGL context {{is quite a}} complex process, and given that it varies between operating systems, automatic OpenGL context creation has become a common feature of several game-development and <b>user-interface</b> libraries, including SDL, Allegro, SFML, FLTK, and Qt.

25|$|Because JavaScript code can run locally in a user's browser (rather than on {{a remote}} server), the browser can respond to user actions quickly, making an {{application}} more responsive. Furthermore, JavaScript code can detect user actions that HTML alone cannot, such as individual keystrokes. Applications such as Gmail take advantage of this: much of the <b>user-interface</b> logic is written in JavaScript, and JavaScript dispatches requests for information (such as the content of an e-mail message) to the server. The wider trend of Ajax programming similarly exploits this strength.|$|E

In this paper we give a software-technological model for the construction of tools supporting two-dimensional editing.

Since the availability of bitmap terminals the number of activities to support two-dimensional representations in <b>user-interfaces</b> has steadily increased and quite a number of support tools have been constructed. The majority of graphical <b>user-interfaces</b> work appropriately for the particular class of two-dimensional representations that were planned to support, and they were constucted from scratch.

40|$|Abstract. Collaborative {{systems that}} {{automate}} {{the sharing of}} programmer-defined user interfaces offer limited coupling flexibility, typically forcing all users of an application to share {{all aspects of the}} user interfaces. Those that automatically support high coupling flexibility are tied to a narrow set of predefined <b>user-interfaces.</b> We have developed a framework that provides high-level and flexible coupling support for arbitrary, programmer-defined user interfaces. The framework refines an abstract layered model of collaboration with structured application layers and automatic acquisition, transformation, and processing of updates. It has been used to easily provide flexible coupling in complex, existing single-user software and shown to support all known ways to share <b>user-interfaces.</b> Coupling flexibility comes at the cost of a small amount of additional programming. We have carefully crafted the framework to ensure that this overhead is proportional to the degree of coupling flexibility desired. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a heuristic {{for assessing the}} usability of mobile <b>user-interfaces</b> in life-threating, time-critical and unstable situations in a qualitative way. The major advantages of our approach as opposed to standardized quantitative questionnaires is the independence from a baseline, the possibility to make absolute statements {{and the potential for}} adaptations. When creating a qualitative semi structured interview we adhere to the common modus operandi of the qualitative social research. On the basis of 17 common quantitative questionnaires on usability we identified the five major categories Utility, Intuitiveness, Memorability, Learnability and Personal Effect. We selected all questions from the questionnaires which are useful for assessing the usability of <b>user-interfaces</b> in emergencies. Furthermore, we rephrased the closedended questions to open-ended ones. The quantification of research results is possible by weighting the qualitative results in dependence to the research question. ...|$|R
25|$|For {{more than}} two decades, the floppy disk was the primary {{external}} writable storage device used. Most computing environments before the 1990s were non-networked, and floppy disks were the primary means of transferring data between computers, a method known informally as sneakernet. Unlike hard disks, floppy disks are handled and seen; even a novice user can identify a floppy disk. Because of these factors, {{a picture of a}} 3Â½-inch floppy disk has become an interface metaphor for saving data. The floppy disk symbol is still used by software on <b>user-interface</b> elements related to saving files, such as the release of Microsoft Office 2013, even though the physical floppy disks are largely obsolete.|$|E
25|$|Not {{only is the}} {{information}} contained within the database continually updated, the software itself has gone through several revisions. Version 1.0 of BIND was released in 1999 and based on user feedback it was modified to include additional detail on experimental conditions required for binding and a hierarchical description of cellular location of the interaction. Version 2.0 was released in 2001 and included the capability to link to information available in other databases. Version 3.0 (2002) expanded the database from physical/biochemical interactions to also include genetic interactions. Version 3.5 (2004) included a refined <b>user-interface</b> that aimed to simplify information retrieval. In 2006, BIND was incorporated into the Biomolecular Object Network Database (BOND) where {{it continues to be}} updated and improved.|$|E
500|$|FTL Games' Dungeon Master (1987) for the Atari ST {{introduced}} several <b>user-interface</b> innovations, such {{as direct}} manipulation {{of objects and}} the environment using the mouse.

The game's complex magic system used runes that could be combined in specific sequences to create magical spells. These sequences were not detailed in the game manual, instead players were required to discover them through trial and error. Sequels followed in 1989 and 1993. The game's first-person, real-time mechanics were copied in SSI's [...] "Black Box" [...] series, from Eye of the Beholder (1990) onward.

500|$|Regardless of how {{the sound}} in an {{instrument}} is produced, many musical instruments have a keyboard as the <b>user-interface.</b> Keyboard instruments are any instruments that are played with a musical keyboard. Every key generates one or more sounds; most keyboard instruments have extra means (pedals for a piano, stops and a pedal keyboard for an organ) to manipulate these sounds. They may produce sound by wind being fanned (organ) or pumped (accordion), vibrating strings either hammered (piano) or plucked (harpsichord), by electronic means (synthesizer), or in some other way. Sometimes, instruments that do not usually have a keyboard, such as the glockenspiel, are fitted with one. Though they have no moving parts and are struck by mallets held in the player's hands, {{they have the same}} physical arrangement of keys and produce soundwaves in a similar manner.

Subjects experienced greater presence, satisfaction, enjoyment, comprehension, perceived ability, and likelihood to use and recommend the application when they use software with high social and spatial cues.
