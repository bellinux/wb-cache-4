40|$|Abstract Background Global obesity {{prevalence}} {{is increasing}} and population health programs {{are required to}} support changes to modifiable lifestyle risk factors. Such interventions benefit from mass-communications to promote their use. The Get Healthy Information and Coaching Service ® (GHS) utilised mass-reach media advertising to recruit participants to an Australian state-wide program. Methods A stand alone population survey collected awareness, knowledge and behavioural variables before the first advertising phase, (n[*]=[*] 1, 544; August -September 2010), during (n[*]=[*] 1, 500; February - March 2011) and after the advertising period (n[*]=[*] 1, 500; June-July 2011). GHS usage data (n[*]=[*] 6, 375) was collated during July 2010 – June 2011. Results The results showed that television-lead mass-media significantly increased <b>unprompted</b> <b>awareness</b> (0 % to 31. 8 %, p[*] Conclusions GHS mass-communications campaigns are effective at increasing awareness and usage of the GHS, especially among hard-to-reach population groups. Television advertising provides universal reach, but should be supplemented by health professional referrals and targeted mail-out information to recruit participants to the intensive GHS coaching program. </p...|$|E
40|$|While {{there are}} many {{measures}} of advertising awareness, there are few guidelines about which of these a researcher should select. We examine how using the brand influences consumer responses to three measures commonly used in advertising tracking instruments. We find that for both top-of-mind and total <b>unprompted</b> advertising <b>awareness</b> measures, brand users are about 2. 5 {{times more likely to}} recall advertising exposure than non-users; however, this ratio was lower for brand-prompted advertising awareness, with brand users only about 1. 7 times more likely than non-users. This, we find, is because non-users respond more to brand-prompted advertising awareness measures. This result influences the scores for small brands, which get 80 % of their responses from non-users only when they are prompted with the brand name. Our conclusion is therefore that scores from different advertising awareness measures are not directly comparable, unless split into separate brand user/non-user groups. Further, practitioners interested in the results for small-share or new brands should use brand-prompted measures, otherwise they risk underestimating the advertising reach and effectiveness of these brands. ...|$|R
40|$|The Get Healthy Information and Coaching Service® (GHS) was {{introduced}} in New South Wales in February 2009. It used mass reach media advertising and direct mail and/or proactive marketing to recruit participants. This article reports on the long-term impact of the campaign on GHS participation from July 2011 to June 2012. A stand-alone population survey collected awareness, knowledge, and behavioral variables before the first advertising phase, (n = 1, 544, August-September 2010), during the advertising period (n = 1, 500, February-March 2011; n = 1, 500, June-July 2011; n = 1, 500, February 2012), and after the advertising period (n = 1, 500, June-July 2012). GHS usage data (n = 6, 095) were collated during July 2011 -June 2012. <b>Unprompted</b> and prompted <b>awareness</b> of GHS mass media significantly increased (0...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to evaluate television advertisements targeted at 55 – 70 -year olds that promoted physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption. Awareness of the campaign, perceived credibility of the source, intentions to visit a promoted website, and intentions to perform the healthy behaviors were evaluated using mixed methods research. Results from a population level survey (n = 1600) showed low <b>unprompted</b> and prompted <b>awareness</b> of the campaign and no differences in intentions or behaviors among those who were aware of the campaign. Unprompted recall resulted in a very wide range of responses including the citation of many commercial advertisers. Qualitative themes that emerged from the focus groups included neutral, positive, and negative comments about the advertisements, source credibility, website considerations specific to seniors, and suggestions about appropriate advertising for older adults. This research showed that the increased attention paid to the advertisements was due in a large part to negative reactions to the character used in the advertisements. Another important finding was the government was not considered to be a credible source of health information. Finally, health promoters should be cautious about websites as the primary source of information, particularly for older adults...|$|R

40|$|Children {{are at a}} {{heightened}} risk for foodborne illness. Handling leftover food safely {{was identified as a}} concern from focus groups with the main food preparer in families with young children in two Midwestern states. To design, implement, and evaluate a theory-based food safety education intervention to raise awareness of the USDA guideline for handling leftover food. The food safety social marketing campaign “ 4 Day Throw Away” launched in towns throughout Nebraska and Iowa. The campaign included both traditional and social media methods to relay the message of discarding leftovers after four days. A total of 600 guardians of young children participated in the study along with the 7 professionals who were involved with {{the development and implementation of}} the campaign. Intercept surveys were conducted in 6 separate locations. Comments were extracted from the social media outlets utilized during the campaign. A process evaluation was conducted of how the team worked to develop and implement the campaign. Of the 300 participants surveyed from the test sites, 24 % provided <b>unprompted</b> or prompted <b>awareness</b> of the 4 Day Throw Away campaign. Half of the participants from test locations reported throwing away leftovers 4 days or less after preparation compared to 38 % from the control locations. The key strategies that emerged from the process evaluation included strong communication techniques, opportunities for personal and professional development, and clear roles and schedule of team member expectations. There continues to be a need to educate parents of young children on proper leftover food safety practices. This campaign was effective in reaching young audiences with the intended message.
