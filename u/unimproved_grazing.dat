40|$|The Monuments at Risk Survey 1995 (MARS) {{outlined}} {{rates and}} causes of identified monument loss in England, showing that 16 % of recorded monuments {{had been completely}} destroyed by 1995, and that 95 % of surviving monuments in England had suffered partial destruction. Hitherto, no equivalent research has been undertaken in Scotland. Using a 17 % random stratified sample of 779 field monuments surviving in 1850 within a study area encompassing much of the local authority areas of Perth and Kinross, Fife and Angus, the present research has analysed the distribution and quantified loss of archaeological monuments since 1850 {{in relation to a}} number of variables including land use, Land Capability for Agriculture, elevation, local authority area, monument period and material construction. Results show that monument distribution within the study area varies most noticeably according to land use and elevation. The highest densities of extant monuments are found in semi-natural woodland (17. 2 extant sample monuments per 100 km 2) and non-intensive land uses such as <b>unimproved</b> <b>grazing</b> and moorland (13. 8 extant sample monuments per 100 km 2). The lowest density of extant monuments is found in arable and improved pasture (4. 5 extant sample monuments per 100 km 2), although this is offset by a recorded density of 11. 5 cropmark sample monuments per 100 km 2. By elevation, monument densities are highest below 100 m OD (24. 4 monuments per 100 km 2) and between 250 m OD and 400 m OD (21 monuments per 100 km 2) with a pronounced paucity of recorded monuments between 100 m OD and 200 m OD, particularly on improved and arable land. For each sample monument, a condition history has been constructed through a desk-based study using data from the National Monuments Record of Scotland. This desk-based study has recorded the greatest causes of monument loss since 1850 as unknown causes (28 % of loss), archaeological excavation (24 % of loss), farming (15 % of loss) and development (11 % of loss). The monument condition histories created through the desk-based study have then been augmented and calibrated for a subsample of 258 monuments by means of an accuracy assessment, using information from vertical and oblique aerial photographs, survey reports from Historic Scotland Monument Wardens and a programme of field survey. Using these additional data sources, the accuracy assessment has identified the largest causes of monument loss within the study area since 1850 as forestry (31 % of loss), farming (28 % of loss) and development (12 % of loss). Analysis shows that among monuments extant in 1850, a minimum of 38 % have been reduced in extent, with at least 5 % destroyed. Loss has been greatest among monuments found in arable and improved land (39 % reduced, 27 % destroyed), forestry (79 % reduced, 9 % destroyed) and developed land (63 % reduced, 27 % destroyed), and lowest among monuments found in permanent pasture (91 % undamaged), semi-natural woodland (75 % undamaged) and rough grazing and moorland (85 % undamaged). Although the use of a desk-based study and accuracy assessment has proved successful in identifying trends in the loss of visible monuments, it has been necessary to employ alternative methods by which to assess damage at buried monuments represented by cropmarks. To this end, a programme of excavation, topographic survey and soil depth recording has been undertaken at five locations in Perth and Kinross. Analysis of the results from this programme of excavation and survey has identified statistically significant relationships between land surface curvature and topsoil depth at three of the five sites examined, enabling the mapping at site scale of areas which are likely to have been subject to greatest agricultural damage. Extrapolating from these site-specific maps, it has been possible to map probable damage and risk to cropmark monuments at a regional scale. Although the validity of this regional scale mapping has been limited by the 25 m cell size of the digital terrain model on which it has been based, the potential of such a technique in enabling a rapid preliminary assessment of damage and risk to cropmark monuments has been demonstrated.

5000|$|In Scotland a crofting {{township}} is a {{group of}} agricultural smallholdings (each with its own few hectares of pasture and arable land (in-bye land)) holding in common a substantial tract of <b>unimproved</b> upland <b>grazing.</b> Each township comprises a formal legal unit. Like older Scottish land measurements, such as the davoch, quarterland and oxgang, the extent of a township often varies according {{to the quality of the}} land it is on, and this can range from a hundred to a few thousand hectares. There is often a substantial tract of <b>unimproved</b> upland common <b>grazing</b> - known as a [...] "shieling" [...] or [...] "Ã irigh" [...] which is held in common. This tends to be used in the summer, but with the advent of fertilisers it is often used in colder times as well.|$|R

In <b>grazed</b> pastures, sheep urine causes local changes in nutrient concentration which may be a source of heterogeneity in microbial community structure. In the present study, we investigated the effects of synthetic urine on soil microbial community structure, using physiological (community level physiological profiling; CLPP), biochemical (phospholipid fatty acid analysis, PLFA) and molecular (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; DGGE) fingerprinting methods. PLFA data suggested that synthetic urine treatment had no significant effect on total microbial (total PLFA), total bacterial or fungal biomass. However, significant changes in microbial community structure were observed with both PLFA and DGGE data. PLFA data suggested that synthetic urine induced a shift towards communities with higher concentrations of branched fatty acids. DGGE banding patterns derived from control and treated soils differed, due to a higher proportion of DNA sequences migrating only to the upper regions of the gel i...|$|R
40|$|Soils {{support an}} {{enormous}} microbial diversity, but the ecological drivers of this diversity are poorly understood. Interactions between {{the roots of}} individual grass species and the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and bacteria in their rhizoplane were studied in a <b>grazed,</b> <b>unimproved</b> upland pasture. Individual root fragments were isolated from soil cores, DNA extracted and used to identify plant species and assess rhizoplane bacterial and AM fungal assemblages, by amplifying part of the small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene, followed by terminal {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} analysis. For the first time we showed that AM fungal and bacterial assemblages are related in situ and that this relationship occurred at the community level. Principal coordinate analyses of the data show that the AM fungi were a major factor determining the bacterial assemblage on grass roots. We also report a strong influence of the composition of the plant community on AM fungal assemblage. The bacterial assemblage was also influenced by soil pH and was spatially structured, whereas AM fungi were influenced neither by the bacteria nor by soil pH. Our study shows that linkages between plant roots and their microbial communities exist in a complex web of interactions that act at individual and at community levels, with AM fungi influencing the bacterial assemblage, but not the other way round...|$|R

The shifts in community structure measured by PLFA and DGGE were significantly correlated with one another, suggesting that both datasets reflected the same changes in microbial communities. Synthetic urine treatment preferentially stimulated the use of rhizosphere-C in sole-carbon-source utilisation profiles. The changes caused by synthetic urine addition accounted for only 10 - 15 % of the total variability in community structure, suggesting that overall microbial community structure was reasonably stable and that changes were confined to a small proportion of the communitie...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSoil {{microbial}} communities play {{an important}} role in nutrient cycling and nutrient availability, especially in <b>unimproved</b> soils. In <b>grazed</b> pastures, sheep urine causes local changes in nutrient concentration which is thought to be a source of heterogeneity in microbial community structure. However, microbial community structure is influenced by a variety of different factors operating at a range of spatial scales, the relative importance of which may depend upon the local environment in which the microbial communities exist. In this study, the relationship between bacterial and fungal rhizoplane and rhizosphere populations was investigated in an upland grassland using tRFLP. The extent to which the short term response of bacterial populations to external perturbation such as the application of synthetic urine was modulated by differences in their immediate environment was also investigated. Procrustean analysis of bacterial and fungal principal coordinate scores showed that the rhizoplane populations were significantly correlated. The analysis also suggested that the closeness of the relationship between the populations depended on the local environment. No significant relationship was found for rhizophere populations however. The effect of synthetic urine deposition on rhizoplane and rhizosphere populations was similar, though much more pronounced for rhizosphere populations, with an increasing divergence between urine treated and control populations during the first 15 days after treatment. In both cases this was followed by a return towards the initial state. Redundancy analysis suggested that of the environmental variables measured (DOC, pH, NH 4 and NO 3) only pH had a significant effect. These data indicate that in heterogeneous environments such as soil fine scale interactions must be taken into consideration if a complete understanding of soil microbial populations is to be obtained...|$|R
