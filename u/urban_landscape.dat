5|$|Lissitzky, {{aware of}} severe {{mismatch}} between his {{ideas and the}} existing <b>urban</b> <b>landscape,</b> experimented with different configurations of the horizontal surface and height-to-width ratios so that the structure appeared balanced visually ("spatial balance is in the contrast of vertical and horizontal tensions"). The raised platform was shaped {{in a way that}} each of its four facets looked distinctly different. Each tower faced the Kremlin with the same facet, providing a pointing arrow to pedestrians on the streets. All eight buildings were planned identically, so Lissitzky proposed color-coding them for easier orientation.|$|E
5|$|The Broadmead {{shopping}} centre was redeveloped {{in the early}} years of the century, involving the demolition of one the city's tallest mid-century towers, Tollgate House, in the construction of Cabot Circus. The former Bristol and West Tower was reworked into a glass skyscraper with glass panels in place of its concrete outer cladding. In 2005, the city council undertook extensive consultations about the future of tall buildings in Bristol, and identified support for new tall buildings so long as they are well designed, sustainable, distinctive and 'fit' into the existing <b>urban</b> <b>landscape.</b>|$|E

5|$|The <b>urban</b> <b>landscape</b> of {{the cities}} changed {{dramatically}} during this period. The Praetorian Building in Dallas (1907) and the Amicable Life Insurance Company building in Waco (1911) {{were among the first}} skyscrapers in Texas. The Perlstein Building in Beaumont was the first skyscraper built {{as a direct result of}} the boom. Beaumont's downtown grew rapidly during the first decade after the 1901 strike. After a second major strike at Spindletop in 1925, Beaumont had the largest skyline of any city between Houston and New Orleans by the end of the decade. The twenty–two story Edson Hotel, completed in 1929, was the tallest hotel building in Texas for several years.|$|E
5|$|Two Rivers is {{the final}} {{checkpoint}} in the Whitehorse–Fairbanks route. Mushers are required to rest at least eight hours in Two Rivers in odd years to ensure the health of their dogs during the final leg of the race. The terrain in this stretch is among the easiest on the trail, with gently rolling hills and forest which gradually change into an <b>urban</b> <b>landscape</b> as racers approach Fairbanks. The greatest challenge for racers in the Two Rivers area is distinguishing the Yukon Quest trail from other sled dog trails, {{many of which have}} similar markings. Mushers have occasionally been deceived by these markings and taken wrong turns.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the {{tradition}} of Scottish landscape painting are in the capriccios of Italian and Dutch landscapes undertaken by James Norie and his sons. These were further developed by Jacob More, who added a romantic sensibility to the Scottish landscape. Alexander Nasmyth helped found the Scottish landscape tradition and was highly influential as a teacher in Edinburgh on the subsequent generation of artists. John Knox linked it with the Romantic works of Walter Scott {{and was one of}} the first artists to take an interest in the <b>urban</b> <b>landscape</b> of Glasgow. Aberdeen-born John Alexander and William Mossman were the leading portrait artists of the first half of the century. Allan Ramsay emerged as the leading portrait painter of the mid-century and to the royal family, noted for his intimate representations. Towards the end of the century Henry Raeburn emerged as the leading portraitist and one of the first artists to spend the majority of their career in Scotland, extending his range to leading figures of the Enlightenment and most famous for his depiction of the Skating Minister.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{deal with}} the effects of <b>urban</b> <b>landscapes</b> on land prices under uncertainty, {{represented}} by fuzzy numbers. To this end, the factors for evaluating <b>urban</b> <b>landscapes</b> are designed using fuzzy numbers. Moreover, we consider 11 factors for utilizing the approach, like as Continuity of external walls, Conformity of colors and materials, Favorable pedestrian space, Decorations and street furniture and etc. Then, two fuzzy hedonic approaches are applied to examine if the essential components of <b>urban</b> <b>landscapes</b> were significant determinants of land prices. Finally, we propose a pessimistic/optimistic approach for analyzing and extracting the relation between effects of <b>urban</b> <b>landscapes</b> on land prices. To the best of our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} in the literature that such effects are examined on the land prices under fuzzy numbers...|$|R
5|$|Beginning in the 1870s, {{entrepreneurs}} {{transformed the}} economy from small, craft-organized factories located {{inside the city}} limits to a large integrated industrial region stretching 50 miles across Allegheny County. The new industrial Pittsburgh was based on integrated mills, mass production, and modern management organization in steel and other industries. Many manufacturers searched for large sites with railroad and river accessibility. They purchased land, designed modern plants, and sometimes built towns for workers. Other firms bought into new communities that began as speculative industrial real estate ventures. Some owners removed their plants from the central city's labor unions to exert greater control over workers. The region's rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas accentuated this dispersal. The rapid growth of steel, glass, railroad equipment, and coke industries resulted in both large mass-production plants and numerous smaller firms. As capital deepened and interdependence grew, participants multiplied, economies accrued, {{the division of labor}} increased, and localized production systems formed around these industries. Transportation, capital, labor markets, and the division of labor in production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district. By 1910 the Pittsburgh district was a complex <b>urban</b> <b>landscape</b> with a dominant central city, surrounded by proximate residential communities, mill towns, satellite cities, and hundreds of mining towns.|$|E
5|$|Hogarth {{replicates}} all {{the features}} of the pastoral scene in an <b>urban</b> <b>landscape.</b> The shepherds and shepherdesses become the beggars and whores, the sun overhead is replaced by the clock on the church, the snow-capped mountains become the snowy rooftops. Even the setting of Covent Garden with piles of fruit and vegetables echoes the country scene. In the centre of the picture the icy goddess of the dawn {{in the form of the}} prim churchgoer is followed by her shivering red-nosed pageboy, mirroring Hesperus, the dawn bearer. The woman is the only one who seems unaffected by the cold, suggesting it may be her element. Although outwardly shocked, the dress of the woman, which is too fashionable for a woman of her age and in the painting is shown to be a striking acid yellow, may suggest she has other thoughts on her mind. She is commonly described as a spinster, and considered to be a hypocrite, ostentatiously attending church and carrying a fashionable ermine muff while displaying no charity to her freezing footboy or the half-seen beggar before her. The figure of the spinster is said to be based on a relative of Hogarth, who, recognising herself in the picture, cut him out of her will. Fielding later used the woman as the model for his character of Bridget Allworthy in Tom Jones.|$|E
5|$|Nasmyth {{was also}} a highly {{influential}} teacher at the Trustee's Academy in Edinburgh. Among his students were painters who took the landscape tradition into the nineteenth century. They included Andrew Wilson (1780–1840), who would become Master of the Academy in 1818, the watercolourist Hugh William Williams (1773–1829), clergyman and artist John Thompson of Duddingston (1778–1840) and probably the artist that would be most directly influenced by Nasmyth, John Knox (1778–1845). Williams' most famous work are interpretive versions of Greek landscapes, based on sketches taken on his travels there, among them The Temple of Poseidon, Cape Sunium (1828). His close friend John Thompson focused on a dark dramatic version of Scottish landscape, as in his most famous work Fast Castle from Below (1824). Knox directly linked Nasmyth's style with the Romantic literature of Walter Scott. Knox's Landscape with Tourists at Lock Katrine (c. 1820), was a commentary on the tourist trade that {{grew up in the}} Trossachs {{in the aftermath of the}} publication of Scott's poem The Lady of the Lake in 1810. He {{was also a}}mong the first artists to take a major interest in depicting the <b>urban</b> <b>landscape</b> of Glasgow. Towards the end of his career he undertook panoramic works of the views from the top of Ben Lomond, which played a part in opening up the Highlands as a spectacle that would be taken up by artists in the second half of the century.|$|E

40|$|The urban {{transformation}} of the planet has spurred interest across {{a wide variety of}} disciplines in the fundamental changes to human society and the environment that result from urbanization. Landscape ecology is no exception. Since the late 1980 s, the number of papers devoted {{to the study of the}} ecology of <b>urban</b> <b>landscapes</b> has risen dramatically. This trend prompted the question I address in this paper: what are the distinguishing features of the study of the ecology of <b>urban</b> <b>landscapes?</b> To answer this question, I reviewed 894 papers, published between 1987 and 2011, describing the ecology of <b>urban</b> terrestrial <b>landscapes.</b> Landscape ecologists who study <b>urban</b> <b>landscapes</b> use the gradient paradigm and the urban ecosystem framework to shape their research questions. They study subjects such as land use/land cover change, the ecological effects of land use type and pattern, and human-made habitats that receive less attention from landscape ecologists studying non-urban areas. They also study a very wide variety of disturbances that occur in <b>urban</b> <b>landscapes.</b> And, increasingly, they are making use of citizen-generated data to answer their questions. Knowledge of the ecology of <b>urban</b> <b>landscapes</b> is largely based on comparisons of land use types, investigations along the urban gradient, and research centered on remnant habitat fragments in an urban matrix. Future directions for the study of the ecology of <b>urban</b> <b>landscapes</b> include testing whether understanding derived in less modified landscapes can be applied to intensively modified <b>urban</b> <b>landscapes,</b> investigating the interactions between agents of global change, such as climate change, and urbanization, investigating the effects of matrix quality on the biodiversity of habitat fragments, expanding our understanding of the ecological effects of land use pattern, and assessing the trade-offs between human needs and the needs of other species by means of transdisciplinary collaborations...|$|R

40|$|To support decision-makings in {{landscape}} management and related policies, an objective methodology for evaluating <b>urban</b> <b>landscapes</b> is necessary. In particular, {{it is anticipated}} to show the economic value of <b>urban</b> <b>landscapes</b> so that the social benefits of regulations on landscapes can be verified. This paper developed a three-step framework for assessing the economic value of <b>urban</b> <b>landscapes,</b> i. e. conducting standardized landscape survey, extracting critical evaluation factors, and identifying the marginal effect of the factors with a hedonic approach. Using Tokyo and Kitakyushu city data, which are typical of large metropolitan areas and local cities, it was empirically demonstrated that the compatibility of buildings and the greenery of neighborhood are distinctively perceived factors, and in both cities, compatibility and greenery were significant determinants of land prices. Although Tokyo and Kitakyushu city differ {{in landscape}} features and many other ways, the economic impacts of <b>urban</b> <b>landscapes</b> were very alike. These results empirically confirmed {{the usefulness of the}} three-step approach for evaluating <b>urban</b> <b>landscapes,</b> and because the improvement of compatibility and greenery require for the collaboration of residents, the results, in a general sense, implied the importance of coordination at neighborhood level...|$|R
