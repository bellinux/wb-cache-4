50|$|In Fall 2006, Height {{released}} a short-run EP of rarities, called <b>Utility</b> <b>Fog.</b> He {{would go on}} to release four EP's in the <b>Utility</b> <b>Fog</b> series, releasing the final EP of the series in 2009.|$|E
40|$|The Internet of Things (IoT) is {{offering}} unprecedented observational {{data that are}} used for managing Smart City <b>utilities.</b> Edge and <b>Fog</b> gateway devices {{are an integral part}} of IoT deployments to acquire real-time data and enact controls. Recently, Edge-computing is emerging as first-class paradigm to complement Cloud-centric analytics. But a key limitation is the lack of a platform-as-a-service for applications spanning Edge and Cloud. Here, we propose ECHO, an orchestration platform for dataflows across distributed resources. ECHO's hybrid dataflow composition can operate on diverse data models [...] streams, micro-batches and files, and interface with native runtime engines like TensorFlow and Storm to execute them. It manages the application's lifecycle, including container-based deployment and a registry for state management. ECHO can schedule the dataflow on different Edge, Fog and Cloud resources, and also perform dynamic task migration between resources. We validate the ECHO platform for executing video analytics and sensor streams for Smart Traffic and Smart Utility applications on Raspberry Pi, NVidia TX 1, ARM 64 and Azure Cloud VM resources, and present our results.

50|$|Hall and his correspondents soon {{realised}} that <b>utility</b> <b>fog</b> {{could be}} manufactured en masse {{to occupy the}} entire atmosphere of a planet and replace any physical instrumentality necessary to human life. By foglets exerting concerted force an object or human could be carried from location to location. Virtual buildings could be constructed and dismantled within moments, enabling the replacement of existing cities and roads with farms and gardens. While molecular nanotech might also replace the need for biological bodies, <b>utility</b> <b>fog</b> would remain a useful peripheral with which to perform physical engineering and maintenance tasks. Thus, <b>utility</b> <b>fog</b> also {{came to be known}} as ″the machine of the future".|$|E
5000|$|Since nanorobots {{would be}} {{microscopic}} in size, {{it would probably}} be necessary for very large numbers of them to work together to perform microscopic and macroscopic tasks. These nanorobot swarms, both those unable to replicate (as in <b>utility</b> <b>fog)</b> and those able to replicate unconstrainedly in the natural environment (as in grey goo and its less common variants, such as synthetic biology or <b>utility</b> <b>fog),</b> are found in many science fiction stories, such as the Borg nanoprobes in Star Trek and The Outer Limits episode [...] "The New Breed".|$|E
5000|$|<b>Utility</b> <b>fog</b> (coined by Dr. John Storrs Hall in 1993) is a {{hypothetical}} collection of tiny robots that can replicate a physical structure. [...] As such, it {{is a form}} of self-reconfiguring modular robotics.|$|E
5000|$|About ten billion {{humans are}} {{alive in the}} solar system, each mind {{surrounded}} by an exocortex of distributed agents, threads of personality spun right out of their heads to run on the clouds of <b>utility</b> <b>fog</b> - infinitely flexible computing resources as thin as aerogel - in which they live.

He founded the sci.nanotech Usenet newsgroup and moderated it for ten years, and served as the founding chief scientist of Nanorex Inc. for two years.

5000|$|Nanochondria {{would be}} able to {{replicate}} themselves within the body, even to the point where a mother would pass them on to her children, reducing the need for them to be implanted after the first generation. Even a single nanochondrion inside of an egg cell {{would be able}} to replicate {{to the point where the}} person that was born from the egg would have nanochondria in every cell in their body. They would interact with and modify cells in the body, [...] potentially allowing people to modify or even make copies of themselves. Due to this, they have been criticized for their ability to make synthetic humans, or even [...] "natural robots", as well as their potential to damage DNA. Nanochondria would even allow a person to exhale a <b>utility</b> <b>fog,</b> allowing them to in effect [...] "breathe" [...] a needed tool.|$|E

5000|$|In {{one school}} of thought the {{programming}} could be external to the material and might be achieved by the [...] "application of light, voltage, electric or magnetic fields, etc." [...] For example, a liquid crystal display {{is a form of}} programmable matter. A second {{school of thought}} is that the individual units of the ensemble can compute and the result of their computation is a change in the ensemble's physical properties. An example of this more ambitious form of programmable matter is claytronics. There are many proposed implementations of programmable matter. Scale is one key differentiator between different forms of programmable matter. At one end of the spectrum reconfigurable modular robotics pursues a form of programmable matter where the individual units are in the centimeter size range.At the nanoscale end of the spectrum there are a tremendous number of different bases for programmable matter, ranging from shape changing molecules to quantum dots. Quantum dots are in fact often referred to as artificial atoms. In the micrometer to sub-millimeter range examples include MEMS-based units, cells created using synthetic biology, and the <b>utility</b> <b>fog</b> concept.|$|E
40|$|Active, {{polymorphic}} material ('Utility Fog') can {{be designed}} as a conglomeration of 100 -micron robotic cells ('foglets'). Such robots could be built with the techniques of molecular nanotechnology. Controllers with processing capabilities of 1000 MIPS per cubic micron, and electric motors with power densities of one milliwatt per cubic micron are assumed. <b>Utility</b> <b>Fog</b> should be capable of simulating most everyday materials, dynamically changing its form and properties, and forms a substrate for an integrated virtual reality and telerobotics...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Robots in {{medicine}} deserve enhanced attention, being a field where their instrumental ids enable exacting options. The availability of oriented effectors, capable {{to get into}} the human body with no or negligible impact, is challenge, evolving while micro-mechanics aims at nanotechnology. The survey addresses sets of known achievements, singling out noteworthy autonomous in body devices, either co-robotic surgical aids, in view of recognizing shared benefits or hindrances, to explore how to conceive effective tools, tailored to answer given demands, while remaining within established technologies. Robotics for medical applications started fifteen years ago while for biological applications it is rather new (about five years old). Robotic surgery can accomplish what doctors cannot because of precision and repeatability of robotic systems. Besides, robots are able to operate in a contained space inside the human body. All these make robots especially suitable for noninvasive or minimally invasive surgery and for better outcomes of surgery. Today, robots have been demonstrated or routinely used for heart, brain, and spinal cord, throat, and knee surgeries at many hospitals in the United States (International Journal of Emerging Medical Technologies, 2005). Nanorobotics is the still largely hypothetical technology of creating machines or robots at or close to the scale of a nanometer(10 - 9 meters). Also known as nanobots or nanites, they would be constructed from nanoscale or molecular components. So far, researchers have only been able to produce some parts of such a machine, such as bearings, sensors, and synthetic molecular motors, but they {{hope to be able to}} create entire robots as small as viruses or bacteria, which could perform tasks on a tiny scale. Possible applications include micro surgery (on the level of individual cells), <b>utility</b> <b>fog,</b> manufacturing, weaponry and cleaning. This presentation provides a survey of current developments, in the spirit of focusing the trends toward the said turn...|$|E
