5|$|A second British raid, {{which had}} been {{scheduled}} to take off from 08:00 on 17 July, was cancelled two minutes before the aircraft were to begin launching when fog began to build <b>up</b> <b>near</b> the carriers, and the British fleet turned south to return to Scapa Flow. Swordfish and Seafire aircraft flew protective patrols over the Home Fleet throughout the morning's operations.|$|E
5|$|Geschwaderkommodore Major Gerhard Michalski {{commanded}} the force. Five pilots {{were shot down}} by ground fire. Another pilot got lost during the flight and ended <b>up</b> <b>near</b> Eindhoven where he was shot down and killed. Reduced in number, 8–10 fighters of IV./JG 4 continued to their target. After 10 minutes, they located a fairly large airfield and attacked, believing it to be Le Culot. It was in fact Sint-Truiden.|$|E
5|$|Gold rush–related boomtowns sprang <b>up</b> <b>near</b> Mono Basin in the 19th {{century to}} exploit bonanzas. The largest of these, Bodie (north of Mono Lake), {{was founded in}} the late 1870s and grew large enough to need a tree mill, which was located at Mono Mills, {{immediately}} northeast of Mono Domes. Trees directly around the domes and on their slopes were felled to provide timber for the mill.|$|E

5|$|At first, {{the forests}} of the {{watershed}} were not significantly affected, but after logging operations sprung <b>up</b> <b>near</b> {{the start of the}} 20th century, most of the virgin timber in the watershed was cleared. The first sawmills were built to provide lumber for local uses, such as building houses and barns. Soon, however, the Washington, Idaho and Montana Railway extended its tracks into the area, allowing lumber to be exported out of the basin. Logging {{turned out to be a}} very profitable industry but had a lasting negative effect on the ecology of the Potlatch River watershed.|$|E
5|$|Blue whale strandings are {{extremely}} uncommon, and, {{because of the}} species' social structure, mass strandings are unheard of. When strandings do occur, they can {{become the focus of}} public interest. In 1920, a blue whale washed <b>up</b> <b>near</b> Bragar on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. It had been shot by whalers, but the harpoon had failed to explode. As with other mammals, the fundamental instinct of the whale was to try to carry on breathing at all costs, even though this meant beaching to prevent itself from drowning. Two of the whale's bones were erected just off a main road on Lewis and remain a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|Born in Johannesburg {{and brought}} <b>up</b> <b>near</b> London, Clarke joined the Royal Artillery {{as an officer}} in 1916 but {{transferred}} to the Royal Flying Corps after finding {{he was too young}} to fight in France. He spent the First World War learning to fly, first in Reading and then Egypt. Clarke returned to the Royal Artillery in 1919 and had a varied career doing intelligence work in the Middle East. In 1936 he was posted to Palestine, where he helped organise the British repression of the 1936 Arab uprising. During the Second World War, Clarke joined John Dill's staff and proposed and helped implement, an idea for commando raids into France– an early form of the British Commandos.|$|E

He grew <b>up</b> <b>near</b> Windsor, Berkshire, where his father {{afterwards}} worked in the Great Park, and as a child frequently encountered members of the Royal Family. After leaving school in 1890, he worked as a boy on the estates, where one of his duties was to look after a mule given to Queen Victoria by Lord Kitchener. In 1892 he enlisted in the 3rd Dragoon Guards, and after leaving the army joined the Glamorganshire Yeomanry as a volunteer.|$|E
5|$|By 1900, Rodin's artistic {{reputation}} was entrenched. Gaining exposure from a pavilion of his artwork set <b>up</b> <b>near</b> the 1900 World's Fair (Exposition Universelle) in Paris, he received requests to make busts of prominent people internationally, while his assistants at the atelier produced duplicates of his works. His income from portrait commissions alone totaled probably 200,000 francs a year. As Rodin's fame grew, he attracted many followers, including the German poet Rainer Maria Rilke, and authors Octave Mirbeau, Joris-Karl Huysmans, and Oscar Wilde.|$|E

This {{was part of}} a three-month-long celebration of the 600th anniversary of Zheng He's maiden voyage, which began in Nanjing, China. A storyboard telling Long Ya Men's significance to Singapore and Zheng He's story, was also put up next to the replica.|$|E

5|$|The Mexican {{army and}} {{emergency}} services were stationed near the coast, while classes at {{public schools in}} and around Acapulco were canceled. Officials in Acapulco advised residents in low-lying areas to be on alert, and also urged fishermen to return to harbor. Authorities in the twin resort cities of Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo closed the port to small ocean craft. Government officials {{in the state of}} Jalisco declared a mandatory evacuation for 8,000citizens in low-lying areas to 900temporary shelters. Temporary shelters were also set <b>up</b> <b>near</b> Acapulco. The state of Michoacán was on a yellow alert, the middle of a five-level alert system. Carnival Cruise Lines diverted the path of one cruise ship traveling along the Pacific waters off Mexico.|$|E

Records show that the mill in Cullompton was owned by a Mr Simon Mills in 1757 and {{was taken over by}} a Mr Theodore Dart in 1799.

US-62 starts to overlap State Highway 51 in Tahlequah as well; the two highways split <b>up</b> <b>near</b> Eldon. The route enters Adair County near Proctor. It intersects with US-59 in Westville before US-62 crosses the state line into Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Leros, New Zealand withdrew its {{squadron}} {{from the}} Long Range Desert Group, compelling the LRDG to reorganise itself into two squadrons of eight patrols each. A Squadron {{was composed of}} Rhodesians and B Squadron comprised British troops and a squadron of signallers; around 80 of the officers and men were from Southern Rhodesia. The group was reassigned from the Middle East Command to the Central Mediterranean Force in early 1944, and deployed to the Gargano peninsula in south-eastern Italy, where a new LRDG headquarters was set <b>up</b> <b>near</b> the seaside town of Rodi. Britain hoped to compel the Germans to commit as many divisions as possible to south-eastern Europe so {{they could not be}} used on the more important fronts closer to Germany. In June 1944 the LRDG was assigned to operate on the western coast of Yugoslavia, with orders to set up observation posts, report the movements of German ships and undertake minor raids.|$|E
