25|$|<b>Unmoderated</b> newsgroups {{form the}} {{majority}} of Usenet newsgroups, and messages submitted by readers for <b>unmoderated</b> newsgroups are immediately propagated for everyone to see. Minimal editorial content filtering vs propagation speed form one crux of the Usenet community. One little cited defense of propagation is canceling a propagated message, but few Usenet users use this command and some news readers do not offer cancellation commands, in part because article storage expires in relatively short order anyway. Almost all <b>unmoderated</b> Usenet groups have become collections of spam.|$|E
25|$|Usenet newsgroups in the Big-8 {{hierarchy}} {{are created}} by proposals called a Request for Discussion, or RFD. The RFD is required to have the following information: newsgroup name, checkgroups file entry, and moderated or <b>unmoderated</b> status. If the group is to be moderated, then at least one moderator with a valid email address must be provided. Other information which is beneficial but not required includes: a charter, a rationale, and a moderation policy if the group is to be moderated. Discussion of the new newsgroup proposal follows, and is finished {{with the members of}} the Big-8 Management Board making the decision, by vote, to either approve or disapprove the new newsgroup.|$|E
25|$|Reviews can {{be given}} by both {{anonymous}} and registered users of most sites, and sites are often programmed to notify the author of new feedback, making them a common way for readers and authors online to communicate directly. This system is intended for a type of bond between the reader and the writer, as well as helping the author improve his or her writing skills through constructive criticism, enabling {{him or her to}} produce a better work next time. Occasionally, <b>unmoderated</b> review systems are abused to send flames, spam, or trolling messages. As a result, the author of the story can either disable or enable anonymous reviews, depending on his/her preference. Internet fan fiction gives young writers a wider audience for their literary efforts than ever before, resulting in improved literacy.|$|E

500|$|Dawkins rose to {{prominence}} in public debates relating {{science and religion}} {{since the publication of}} his most popular book The God Delusion in 2006, which became an international best seller. As of 2015, more than three million copies were sold and the book has been translated into over 30 languages. Its success has been seen by many as indicative of a change in the contemporary cultural zeitgeist and has also been identified with the rise of New Atheism. In the book, Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion—"a fixed false belief". In his February 2002 TED talk entitled [...] "Militant atheism", Dawkins urged all atheists to openly state their position and to fight the incursion of the church into politics and science. On 30 September 2007, Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris, and Daniel Dennett met at Hitchens' residence for a private, <b>unmoderated</b> discussion that lasted two hours. The event was videotaped and titled [...] "The Four Horsemen".|$|E
2500|$|The {{goals are}} to {{increase}} the efficiency of uranium usage by breeding plutonium and eliminating the need for transuranic isotopes ever to leave the site. [...] The reactor design uses an <b>unmoderated</b> core running on fast neutrons, designed to allow any transuranic isotope to be consumed (and in some cases used as fuel). [...] In addition to the benefits of removing the long half-life transuranics from the waste cycle, the SFR fuel expands when the reactor overheats, and the chain reaction automatically slows down. In this manner, it is passively safe.|$|E
2500|$|Highly {{enriched uranium}} (HEU) has a 20% or higher {{concentration}} of 235U. The fissile uranium in nuclear weapon primaries usually contains 85% {{or more of}} 235U known as weapons-grade, though theoretically for an implosion design, a minimum of 20% could be sufficient (called weapon(s)-usable) although it would require hundreds of kilograms of material and [...] "would not be practical to design"; even lower enrichment is hypothetically possible, but as the enrichment percentage decreases the critical mass for <b>unmoderated</b> fast neutrons rapidly increases, with for example, an infinite mass of 5.4% 235U being required. For criticality experiments, enrichment of uranium to over 97% has been accomplished.|$|E
2500|$|This is a reactor {{design that}} is cooled by liquid metal, totally <b>unmoderated,</b> and {{produces}} more fuel than it consumes. They {{are said to}} [...] "breed" [...] fuel, because they produce fissionable fuel during operation because of neutron capture. These reactors can function much like a PWR in terms of efficiency, and do not require much high-pressure containment, as the liquid metal {{does not need to}} be kept at high pressure, even at very high temperatures. BN-350 and BN-600 in USSR and Superphénix in France were a reactor of this type, as was Fermi-I in the United States. The Monju reactor in Japan suffered a sodium leak in 1995 and was restarted in May 2010. All of them use/used liquid sodium. These reactors are fast neutron, not thermal neutron designs. These reactors come in two types: ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 30, 2014, dissenters {{released}} a [...] "controversial, vulgar" [...] rant Driscoll had written under the pseudonym [...] "William Wallace II" [...] in 2000, dubbed the [...] "Pussified Nation" [...] rant. The rant contained [...] "blunt and emotional comments critical of feminism, homosexual behavior, and 'sensitive emasculated' men", {{and called for}} [...] "real men" [...] to rise up {{in the spirit of}} Scottish warrior William Wallace as depicted in the film Braveheart. Mars Hill Church had long since deleted their <b>unmoderated</b> [...] "Midrash" [...] discussion board where the forum postings occurred. Driscoll referenced the incident in his 2006 book Confessions of Reformission Rev, where he confirmed and expressed regret that, though he believed his intentions were [...] "good", he had personally written the rant. He wrote in 2006, [...] "I had a good mission, but some of my tactics were born out of anger and burnout, and I did a lot of harm and damage while attracting a lot of attention." [...] Driscoll responded to the release of the rant {{in a letter to his}} congregation, writing that [...] "the content of my postings to that discussion board does not reflect how I feel or how I would conduct myself today." [...] On September 8, 2014, blogger Libby Anne republished other examples of material written by [...] "William Wallace II" [...] in 2001, and remarked she had “rarely seen an evangelical man assert male superiority and prominence this directly.” ...|$|E
2500|$|His bestseller God Is Not Great affirmed Hitchens's {{position}} in the [...] "New Atheism" [...] movement, and he was made an Honorary Associates of the Rationalist International and the National Secular Society. Hitchens said he would accept an invitation from any religious leader who wished to debate with him. He also served on the advisory board of the Secular Coalition for America, a group of atheists and humanists. On 30 September 2007, Richard Dawkins, Hitchens, Sam Harris, and Daniel Dennett met at Hitchens's residence for a private, <b>unmoderated</b> discussion that lasted two hours. The event was videotaped and titled [...] "The Four Horsemen". In it, Hitchens stated {{at one point that}} he considered the Maccabean Revolt the most unfortunate event in human history due to the reversion from Hellenistic thought and philosophy to messianism and fundamentalism that its success constituted. That year, Hitchens began a series of written debates on the question [...] "Is Christianity Good for the World?" [...] with Christian theologian and pastor Douglas Wilson, published in Christianity Today magazine. This exchange eventually became a book by the same title in 2008. During their promotional tour of the book, they were accompanied by the producer Darren Doane's film crew. Doane produced the film Collision: Is Christianity GOOD for the World?, which was released on 27 October 2009. On 4 April 2009 Hitchens debated William Lane Craig on the existence of God at Biola University. In God Is Not Great, he expanded his criticism to include all religions, including those rarely criticised by Western secularists, such as Buddhism and neo-paganism. The book received mixed responses, from praise in The New York Times for his [...] "logical flourishes and conundrums" [...] to accusations of [...] "intellectual and moral shabbiness" [...] in the Financial Times. God Is Not Great was nominated for a National Book Award on 10 October 2007. Hitchens said that organised religion is [...] "the main source of hatred in the world", [...] "iolent, irrational, intolerant, allied to racism, tribalism, and bigotry, invested in ignorance and hostile to free inquiry, contemptuous of women and coercive toward children: [...] ought to have a great deal on its conscience". Hitchens therefore says in God Is Not Great that humanity is in need of a renewed Enlightenment.|$|E

50|$|MUN {{committees}} can {{be divided}} into three general sessions: formal debate, moderated caucus, and <b>unmoderated</b> caucus. In a formal debate, the staff maintains a list of speakers and the delegates follow the order written on the 'speaker list'. Speakers may be added to the speaker list by raising their placards or sending a note to the chair. During this time, delegates talk to the entire committee. They make speeches, answer questions, and debate on resolutions and amendments. If there are no other motions, the committee goes back to formal debate by default. There is usually a time limit. In a moderated caucus, the committee goes into a recess and the rules of procedure are suspended. Anyone may speak if recognized by the chair. A vote on a motion is necessary to go into a moderated caucus. There is a comparatively shorter time limit per speech. In an <b>unmoderated</b> caucus, the delegates informally meet with other delegates and the staff for discussions.|$|E
