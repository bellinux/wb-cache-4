5|$|HSP occurs {{more often}} in {{children}} than in adults, and usually follows an <b>upper</b> <b>respiratory</b> tract infection. Half of affected patients are below the age of six, and 90% are under ten. It occurs about twice as often in boys as in girls. The incidence of HSP in children is about 20 per 100,000 children per year, making it the most common vasculitis in children.|$|E
5|$|By late 2004, Brokaw {{had retired}} from his {{anchoring}} duties at NBC, ceding the reins to Brian Williams; Rather planned {{to step down}} in March 2005. Jennings and ABC saw an opportunity to gain viewers, and initiated a publicity blitz touting the anchor's foreign reporting experience. However, despite having almost always reported {{from the scene of}} any major news story, Jennings was sidelined by an <b>upper</b> <b>respiratory</b> infection in late December 2004; he was forced to anchor from New York during the aftermath of the Asian tsunami, while his competitors traveled to the region. For Jennings, the situation was agonizing.|$|E
5|$|Prolonged skin {{contact with}} {{glacial acetic acid}} may result in tissue destruction. Inhalation {{exposure}} (eight hours) to acetic acid vapours at 10 ppm can produce some irritation of eyes, nose, and throat; at 100 ppm marked lung irritation and possible damage to lungs, eyes, and skin may result. Vapour concentrations of 1,000 ppm cause marked irritation of eyes, nose and <b>upper</b> <b>respiratory</b> tract and cannot be tolerated. These predictions were based on animal experiments and industrial exposure. Skin sensitization to acetic acid is rare, but has occurred.|$|E

5000|$|Sulcatone A, a {{naturally}} occurring biflavonoid isolated from Ouratea sulcata. Extracts {{of the leaves}} of this plant, used with and with other plant's extracts, are used in many African countries to treat some infections such as <b>upper</b> tract <b>respiratory</b> infections, dysenteria, diarrhoea and toothache. Positive antimicrobial activity has been shown in-vitro against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis. Escherichia coli showed to be resistant in the same study.|$|R
40|$|Hypogammaglobulinemia is {{a feature}} of several B-cell {{disorders}} and is manifested clinically by recurrent infection, most commonly chronic <b>upper</b> and lower <b>respiratory</b> tract disease. Immunoglobulin replacement therapy is available, with at least four different routes of administration. There are as yet no convincing data that allow comparison of the cost-effectiveness of these methods. However, by individualizing therapy for each patient, {{it is possible to}} prevent life-threatening acute infections, reduce the severity of chronic <b>upper</b> and lower <b>respiratory</b> tract disease, improve pulmonary function and achieve normal levels of IgG. These are the currently acceptable goals of therapy in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia...|$|R
5|$|The {{common cold}} is a viral {{infection}} of the <b>upper</b> <b>respiratory</b> tract. The most commonly implicated virus is a rhinovirus (30–80%), a type of picornavirus with 99 known serotypes. Other commonly implicated viruses include human coronavirus (≈15%), influenza viruses (10–15%), adenoviruses (5%), human respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, and metapneumovirus. Frequently more than one virus is present. In total over 200 viral types are associated with colds.|$|E
5|$|The common cold, {{also known}} simply as a cold, is a viral {{infectious}} disease of the <b>upper</b> <b>respiratory</b> tract that primarily affects the nose. The throat, sinuses, and larynx may also be affected. Signs and symptoms may begin less than two days following exposure. They include coughing, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, headache, and fever. People usually recover in seven to ten days. Some symptoms may last up to three weeks. In those with other health problems, pneumonia may occasionally develop.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinction}} between viral <b>upper</b> <b>respiratory</b> tract infections is {{loosely based on}} the location of symptoms with the common cold affecting primarily the nose, pharyngitis the throat, and bronchitis the lungs. However, there can be significant overlap and multiple areas can be affected. The common cold is frequently defined as nasal inflammation with varying amount of throat inflammation. Self-diagnosis is frequent. Isolation of the viral agent involved is rarely performed, and it is generally not possible to identify the virus type through symptoms.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{symptoms}} that are characteristic of lower respiratory tract infections. The two most common are bronchitis and cancer and adema. Influenza affects both the <b>upper</b> and lower <b>respiratory</b> tracts.|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{aim of this}} {{analysis}} is to explore views of patients with CRS (chronic rhinosinusitis) about of the aetiology of their respiratory symptoms {{and the relationship between}} <b>upper</b> and lower <b>respiratory</b> symptoms. Methods: This study {{is part of a larger}} mixed methods study investigating the epidemiology of CRS which comprises a questionnaire study of patients with CRS and controls and a qualitative study of 21 patients with CRS. Semi structured qualitative interviews were undertaken these patients; 11 male, 10 female. 12 patients had asthma. Patients were recruited from a tertiary outpatient rhinology clinic. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis using Nvivo software. Several important and recurring themes were highlighted. Results: Patients described many perceived triggering factors and an interaction between <b>upper</b> and lower <b>respiratory</b> tract symptoms. They felt that their symptoms could be managed more holistically. Conclusions: Concerns about triggers of respiratory symptoms and interactions between <b>upper</b> and lower <b>respiratory</b> symptoms are of significant concern to patients. These should be appropriately managed and acknowledged in formal treatment pathways, for example through the use of combined ENT/respiratory clinics...|$|R

5|$|Exposure to yttrium {{compounds}} in humans may cause lung disease. Workers exposed to airborne yttrium europium vanadate dust experienced mild eye, skin, and <b>upper</b> <b>respiratory</b> tract irritation—though {{this may be}} caused by the vanadium content rather than the yttrium. Acute exposure to yttrium compounds can cause shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, and cyanosis. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) limits exposure to yttrium in the workplace to 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended exposure limit (REL) is 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 500mg/m3, yttrium is immediately dangerous to life and health. Yttrium dust is flammable.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that, in 12 workers exposed for two or more years to acetic acid airborne average concentration of 51 ppm (estimated), produced symptoms of conjunctive irritation, <b>upper</b> <b>respiratory</b> tract irritation, and hyperkeratotic dermatitis. Exposure to 50 ppm or more is intolerable to most persons and results in intensive lacrimation and irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, with pharyngeal oedema and chronic bronchitis. Unacclimatised humans experience extreme eye and nasal irritation at concentrations in excess of 25 ppm, and conjunctivitis from concentrations below 10 ppm {{has been reported}}. In a study of five workers exposed for seven to 12 years to concentrations of 80 to 200 ppm at peaks, the principal findings were blackening and hyperkeratosis of {{the skin of the}} hands, conjunctivitis (but no corneal damage), bronchitis and pharyngitis, and erosion of the exposed teeth (incisors and canines).|$|E

40|$|AIM [...] To {{determine}} {{concentrations of}} fibronectin and fibronectin receptor {{in children with}} pertussis. METHODS [...] Concentrations of circulating fibronectin and serum fibronectin receptor were detected in eight children affected by pertussis, eight children with acute <b>upper</b> or lower <b>respiratory</b> tract infections, and in 14 healthy control children. The single radial immunodiffusion technique and a solid phase enzyme immunoassay were used to detect circulating serum concentrations of fibronectin and fibronectin receptor. RESULTS [...] On admission, {{a significant decrease in}} fibronectin was detected in children with pertussis (p = 0. 0006). Significant and decreased concentrations of fibronectin were also observed in children with <b>upper</b> or lower <b>respiratory</b> tract infections (p = 0. 0002). On the other hand, serum fibronectin receptor concentrations were significantly increased in patients with pertussis, whereas patients with <b>upper</b> or lower <b>respiratory</b> tract infections had normal circulating fibronectin receptor concentrations. CONCLUSIONS [...] Fibronectin deficiency in children with pertussis may be related to diffusion and deposition of this protein in bronchial and alveolar spaces to limit infection, while increased fibronectin receptor concentrations are probably the expression of T cell activation and cell-mediated immunity during Bordetella pertussis infection...|$|R
