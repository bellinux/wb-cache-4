5|$|Massaro was a {{contestant}} on CBS's , {{which was}} the fifteenth season of the show, in 2007. Massaro approached the WWE {{with the idea of}} doing the show, and after going through the casting process, she found out she made the show ten days before she had to leave for China to film. Prior to the experience, Massaro had never been camping before, so to train for the show she had to get <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> outside. She was assigned to the Zhan Hu tribe in the first episode and quickly began quarreling with fellow contestant Dave Cruser. In the second episode, Massaro was voted off after six days with a 6â€“1 vote.|$|E
5|$|Upon his {{accession}} to the imperial throne, Joseph ruled less land {{than his father}} had in 1740. Believing that the emperor must possess enough land to maintain the Empire's integrity, Maria Theresa, who was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> assisted {{in the administration of}} her vast realms, declared Joseph to be her new co-ruler on 17 September 1765. From then on, mother and son had frequent ideological disagreements. The 22million gulden that Joseph inherited from his father was injected into the treasury. Maria Theresa had another loss in February 1766 when Haugwitz died. She gave her son absolute control over the military following the death of Count Leopold Joseph von Daun.|$|E
25|$|During the 18th century, opium {{was found}} to be a good remedy for nervous disorders. Due to its {{sedative}} and tranquilizing properties, it was used to quiet the minds of those with psychosis, help with people who were considered insane, and also to help treat patients with insomnia. However, despite its medicinal values in these cases, it was noted that in cases of psychosis, it could cause anger or depression, and due to the drug's euphoric effects, it could cause depressed patients to become more depressed after the effects wore off because they would get <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> high.|$|E
500|$|Conservative columnists George Will and Pat Buchanan {{state that}} {{opponents of the}} team name are being oversensitive, {{although}} Charles Krauthammer drew a parallel between the evolution of [...] "Negro" [...] and [...] "Redskin" [...] from <b>being</b> in common <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> condescending and insulting. [...] W. James Antle III, Rich Lowry, and Dennis Prager wrote that outrage over mascots is manufactured by white liberals, rather than being the authentic voice of Native Americans.|$|R

25|$|The robot Gort, {{who serves}} Klaatu, was played by Lock Martin, {{who worked as}} an usher at Grauman's Chinese Theater and stood seven feet, seven inches tall. Not <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> in such a confining, heat-inducing costume, he worked {{carefully}} when wearing the two oversize, laced-up-the-front or back, foamed neoprene suits needed for creating the illusion on screen of a seamless metallic Gort. Wise decided that Martin's on-screen shooting time {{would be limited to}} half-hour intervals, so Martin, with his generally weak constitution, would face no more than minor discomfort. These segments, in turn, were then edited together into film's final print.|$|E
25|$|Expert {{scientists}} {{helped the}} producers to film animal behaviour that is rarely seen. The team 'staked out' radiotagged timber rattlesnakes {{in order to}} witness one of them despatching its prey. However, for Attenborough's close encounter with a spitting cobra, a captive snake that was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> handled {{was placed in a}} natural setting and the presenter wore a face visor. Other examples of 'pets' being used were for sequences depicting the lassoing tongue of a chameleon (which had to be filmed at ultra-high speed) and the digestive system of a python (which was enhanced by computer-generated imagery).|$|E
25|$|This an {{opportunity}} to put people who would normally {{have no reason to}} interact with each other on one team... I want people whose power sets really build on each other so that there are specific limitations that can only become overcome by working together. Nobody's so overpowered that it gets boring and nobody's so underpowered that they have to be saved all the time. I wanted a balance visually and practically... What's also going to be interesting is working out the power structure of the group.

5000|$|Arden Frederick [...] "Freddie" [...] Sessler (26 May 1923 - 18 December 2000) was {{the brother}} of London restaurateur and club owner Siegi Sessler, and a {{long-term}} intimate of the Rolling Stones, particularly Keith Richards, to whom he supplied drugs. A raconteur, Sessler claimed to have met and become friends {{with a number of}} important figures in twentieth century music. He attributed his manic lifestyle of partying and drug <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> almost the only one of his family to escape extermination by the Nazis during the Second World War. Ronnie Wood described Sessler as a [...] "sex-fuelled, vodka charged, coke mountain".|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-1950s, further {{continental}} influences {{brought a}} more elegant image to light, lower-cut slip-ons, which moved from purely casual <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> paired with suits in the 1960s (but still only in America). [...] In 1966, Italian designer Gucci made the further step of adding a metal strap {{across the front}} {{in the shape of}} a horse's snaffle bit. These Gucci loafers (now a general term referring to shoes of this style by any manufacturer) also spread over the Atlantic and were worn by 1970s businessmen, becoming almost a Wall Street uniform, reaching widespread use by the 1980s.|$|R
25|$|Katie (Megan Prescott) and Emily Fitch (Kathryn Prescott) {{are very}} {{different}} identical twin sisters. Katie thinks of herself {{as something of a}} WAG and wants to usurp Effy's place as queen bee of the group. Katie's homophobic attitudes cause problems between them, as Emily comes to terms with her homosexuality. The quieter of the two, Emily is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> in her sister's shadow, and is sulky but perceptive. She tends to not stand out in a crowd due to her insecurities, but later grows out within the show. She is in love with Naomi Campbell (Lily Loveless), a fiery, politically charged and passionate young woman with idealistic views and an abundance of ambition. Emily also develops a good friendship with JJ, becoming close confidantes to one another.|$|E
25|$|When Kline joined Mackay, Australia were 207-9 and {{appeared}} doomed, {{for there was}} still one hour and fifty minutes playing time remaining. Only two minutes later, Sobers, fielding only four yards from the bat, appealed confidently for a catch from Mackay off Worrell, but Egar ruled {{that it was not}} out. In one of the great rearguard actions, the pair proceeded to play out the remaining time. Mackay was a capable batsman but Kline was a bowler and less <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> asked to make a long stand at the crease. In his thirteen Tests Kline never exceeded the 15 not out that he made on this occasion. Mackay's 62 not out occupied 223 balls, and Kline's score was made from 109. Their unbroken last wicket stand added 66, though the runs were almost an irrelevance.|$|E
500|$|Bill Nighy as General of Infantry Friedrich Olbricht: Nighy {{was cast}} {{to give a}} {{sympathetic}} quality, so Olbricht {{would not be the}} [...] "fall guy". Nighy wanted to convey Olbricht as divided between complaining about Hitler's regime and actually doing something about it. The actor described his portrayal, [...] "One of the most disconcerting things imaginable is to put on a Nazi uniform. It's so associated with evil that it took me several days to get <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> in costume." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1966 Walton {{successfully}} {{underwent surgery}} for lung cancer. Until {{then he had}} been an inveterate pipe-smoker, but after the operation he never smoked again. While he was convalescing, he worked on a one-act comic opera, The Bear, which was premiered at Britten's Aldeburgh Festival, in June 1966, and enthusiastically received. Walton had become so <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> written off by music critics that he felt [...] "there must be something wrong when the worms turned on some praise." [...] Walton received the Order of Merit in 1967, the fourth composer to be so honoured, after Elgar, Vaughan Williams and Britten.|$|E
500|$|Manning began basic {{training}} at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, on October 2, 2007. She wrote that she soon {{realized she was}} neither physically nor mentally prepared for it. Six weeks after enlisting, she {{was sent to the}} discharge unit. She was allegedly being bullied, and in the opinion of another soldier, was having a breakdown. The soldier told The Guardian: [...] "The kid was barely five foot ... He was a runt, so pick on him. He's crazy, pick on him. He's a faggot, pick on him. The guy took it from every side. He couldn't please anyone." [...] Nicks writes that Manning, who was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> bullied, fought backâ€”if the drill sergeants screamed at her, she would scream at themâ€”to the point where they started calling her [...] "General Manning".|$|E
500|$|As Bambi grows older, {{his mother}} begins {{to leave him}} alone. While searching for her one-day, Bambi has his first {{encounter}} with [...] "He"â€”the animals' term for humansâ€”which terrifies him. The man raises a firearm and aims at him; Bambi flees at top speed, joined by his mother. After he is scolded by a stag for crying for his mother, Bambi gets <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> alone at times. He later learns the stag is called the [...] "Old Prince," [...] the oldest and largest stag in the forest {{who is known for}} his cunning and aloof nature. During the winter, Bambi meets Marena, a young doe, Nettla, an old doe who no longer bears young, and two princes Ronno and Karus. Mid-winter, hunters enter the forest, killing many animals including Bambi's mother. Gobo also disappears and is presumed dead.|$|E

500|$|Vikram allotted 18 {{months and}} 190 {{days of his}} call sheet for the film, {{including}} 165 days of bulk dates spread across six months. Speaking {{on the extent of}} his involvement in the filmmaking process, Vikram said, [...] "Before beginning the film, I was totally involved in the research and preparation, but once on the sets, I go by what the director says." [...] He further clarified that he discussed every shot with Shankar, went for re-takes where necessary to make the scenes better, and gave suggestions, but left the [...] "ultimate verdict" [...] to the director. Disclosing that, among the three shades to his character, he found playing Ambi to be the toughest, he reasoned, [...] "Because as a hero you are not <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> a wimp on screen. It's difficult digesting getting beaten up." [...] In contrast, being a graduate in English literature, he found playing Remo much easier and more in his comfort zone.|$|E
500|$|Eurogamer's Kristan Reed was unimpressed {{with the}} game, calling it [...] "a bit half-baked". He praised {{the opening of}} the game, arguing that, like Hansen himself, the player feels a strong sense of {{disorientation}} as they get <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> on the ship {{in the middle of a}} storm. However, he felt the strong opening soon gives way to clichÃ©s. He was highly critical of the absence of a map, arguing that because the environments all look similar, getting lost is a regular occurrence. GameSpot's Carrie Gouskos scored the PlayStation 2 version 6.9 out of 10 and the Xbox version 7.2 out of 10. She argued [...] "Atmospherically, Cold Fear is derivative and predictable, which is a shame considering that it is, at times, an enjoyable action game." [...] Although she praised the outdoor scenes on the boat, she felt there were not enough of them, with too many [...] "generic indoor locations." [...] She was also highly critical of the lack of a map and the autosave feature, feeling the save points were unevenly distributed.|$|E
500|$|Romney {{was largely}} outside the president's inner circle and had minimal {{influence}} within the Nixon administration. [...] His intense, sometimes bombastic style of making bold advances and awkward pullbacks lacked adequate guile {{to succeed in}} Washington. Desegregation efforts in employment and education had more success than in housing during the Nixon administration, but HUD's many missions and unwieldy structure, which sometimes worked at cross-purposes, made it institutionally vulnerable to political attack. [...] Romney also failed to understand or circumvent Nixon's use of counsel Ehrlichman and White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman as policy gatekeepers, resulting in de facto downgrading {{of the power of}} cabinet officers. [...] Romney was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> listened to and making his own decisions; he annoyed Nixon by casually interrupting him at meetings. At one point, Nixon told Haldeman, [...] "Just keep [...] away from me." [...] A statement by Romney that he would voluntarily reduce his salary to aid the federal budget was viewed by Nixon as an [...] "ineffective grandstand play".|$|E

500|$|Frank {{has been}} outspoken on many civil rights issues, {{including}} lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights. In 1987, he publicly {{came out as}} gay. In 1990, Frank was instrumental in crafting the 1990 Immigration Act, which restated the reasons for which a person could be denied entry into the country. [...] The act did not include [...] "sexual preference exclusion", reforming earlier immigration law which allowed persons to be excluded for a sexual deviance [...] "afflict". He said in a 1996 interview: [...] "I'm <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> in the minority. I'm a left-handed gay Jew. I've never felt, automatically, a member of any majority." [...] In 1995, then-Republican House Majority Leader Dick Armey famously referred to Frank as [...] "Barney Fag" [...] in a press interview. Armey apologized {{and said it was}} [...] "a slip of the tongue". Frank did not accept Armey's explanation, saying [...] "I turned to my own expert, my mother, who reports that in 59 years of marriage, no one ever introduced her as Elsie Fag." [...] In 1998, Frank founded the National Stonewall Democrats, the national LGBT Democratic organization.|$|E
500|$|Eve was {{contracted}} {{to appear in}} two episodes of Glee, having been offered the role of Grace after Whitney Houston declined to appear. Discussing her casting, Eve stated: [...] "I got asked and I'd heard the buzz about the show. When the first pilot episode came out, I figured it was something different and something we haven't seen on TV before. I didn't want to turn it down!" [...] She commented {{that she would have}} loved to have seen Whitney Houston appear in the show, explaining: [...] "I think it would've been different in a sense because she's an original diva. She would've brought a whole other energy, which would've been amazing." [...] Comparing her character Grace to McKinley High glee director Will, Eve explained: [...] "For me especially, I come from a harder place. I'm the teacher of a reform school. I'm <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> very strict." [...] Asked if she would return to the show in the future, she replied: [...] "If I'm asked to do it, I definitely would. It's just a really well-made, smart show." [...] Though she does not sing in [...] "Hairography", Eve commented that she would like to do so if she returned to Glee in the future, naming [...] "Sweet Dreams" [...] by Eurythmics as her ideal song choice.|$|E
500|$|The {{new system}} of {{government}} in Athens opened up a wealth of opportunity for men like Themistocles, who previously {{would have had no}} access to power. Moreover, the new institutions of the democracy required skills that had previously been unimportant in government. Themistocles was to prove himself a master of the new system; [...] "he could infight, he could network, he could spin... and crucially, he knew how to make himself visible." [...] Themistocles moved to the Ceramicus, a down-market part of Athens. This move marked him out as a 'man of the people', and allowed him to interact more easily with ordinary citizens. He began building up a support base among these newly empowered citizens: [...] "he wooed the poor; and they, not <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> courted, duly loved him back. Touring the taverns, the markets, the docks, canvassing where no politician had thought to canvas before, making sure never to forget a single voter's name, Themistocles had set his eyes on a radical new constituency" [...] However, he took care to ensure that he did not alienate the nobility of Athens. He began to practice law, the first person in Athens to prepare for public life in this way. His ability as attorney and arbitrator, used {{in the service of the}} common people, gained him further popularity.|$|E
