50|$|The {{park was}} {{landscaped}} on the northeastern extremity {{of what was}} originally a woodland area in the Manor or Prebend of Brownswood. It {{was part of a}} large expanse of woodland called Hornsey Wood that was cut further and further back for <b>use</b> <b>as</b> <b>grazing</b> <b>land</b> during the Middle Ages. In the mid-18th century a tea room had opened on the knoll of land on which Finsbury Park is situated. Londoners would travel north to escape the smoke of the capital and enjoy the last remains of the old Hornsey Wood. Around 1800 the tea rooms were developed into a larger building which became known as the Hornsey Wood House/Tavern. A lake was also built {{on the top of the}} knoll with water pumped up from the nearby New River. There was boating, a shooting and archery range, and probably cock fighting and other blood sports. The Hornsey Wood Tavern was destroyed in the process of making the area into a park, but the lake was enlarged. Once the park had opened, a pub across the road from its eastern entrance along Seven Sisters Road called itself the Hornsey Wood Tavern after the original. This pub was later renamed the Alexandra Dining Room and closed for business in April 2007. It was subsequently demolished.|$|E

40|$|Generally, the Subcarpathian {{area between}} the Dâmboviţa and the Prahova is {{characterized}} by very diverse landscapes and an intense human impact. Secondary or derived vegetal associations are also present to a large extent, in relative balance with a certain type and degree of human pressure. Some of these vegetal associations are extremely rich in flora and fauna. The most frequent are the lawn associations <b>used</b> <b>as</b> hayfields and pastures. Orchards are often associated with grassy vegetation <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>grazing</b> <b>land</b> or more often as hayfields. There are relatively frequent shrub clusters and they represent isolated vegetation on rocky crests or, quite often, an intermediary stage towards the initial forest vegetation on formerly deforested terrains where there {{is more or less}} intense degradation. All these remain stable as long <b>as</b> man <b>uses</b> them rationally. When human impact goes beyond nature’s capacity to withstand it, most of the terrains <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>grazing</b> <b>land</b> or covered by shrub clusters show significant degradation, which leads to much fewer species with diminished productive potential. The landscape types of this Subcarpathian area are: the high hill landscape, the low and medium altitude hill landscape and the large corridors and depressions landscape...|$|R
50|$|From Thaleischweiler-Fröschen to Zweibrücken, {{the line}} crosses the {{predominantly}} agriculturally dominated Westricher plateau. It runs through many curves through the Schwarzbach valley, {{which is located}} between rolling hills; the valley floor is mostly <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>grazing</b> <b>land</b> and its slopes are reserved for forests. Shortly before {{the confluence of the}} Schwarzbach with the Blies, it passed through Zweibrücken Central Station. It then crosses the state border with Saarland at Einöd and now runs through the Saar-Palatinate district.|$|R
50|$|Nearby is Minchinhampton Common, a Site of Special Scientific Interest. It {{offers an}} area of 580 acre for the {{recreation}} of walkers and golfers and is managed by the National Trust. The Common is also <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>grazing</b> <b>land</b> for the cows of local farmers in the summer. On the Common are long parallel ditches and mounds which formed {{part of a large}} Iron Age fort. There are outstanding views from the Common, west over the Severn estuary into Wales, and east to the Golden Valley and further into the Cotswolds.|$|R
50|$|The largest {{open area}} is Hob Moor {{which is part}} of the Knavesmire, that {{together}} make up Micklegate Stray. This land was once used for growing crops as demonstrated by the ridges and furrows still evident. As of 2010, it is still <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>grazing</b> <b>land,</b> licensed by York City Council. Hob Moor was designated as a Local Nature Reserve in 2003 and hosts a variety of flora and fauna. Amongst the birds that can be found here are meadow pipit, skylark, whinchat, wheatear, yellow wagtail and merlin.|$|R
50|$|It can {{be assumed}} that in earlier centuries, when the forests were <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>grazing</b> <b>lands,</b> the {{woodland}} edge was less prominent than it is today. Evidence {{of this is the}} striking frequency of the holly tree, that was not cleared and thus spread rapidly. Since the mid-twentieth century the forest has been on the advance and it requires regular care to prevent a forestation of the edge of the meadows. A diploma thesis found that in the early 18th century, the local people cultivated the soil of the upper and lower plateaus, although these plateaus were forest regions at that time.|$|R
50|$|Until {{then there}} was little {{development}} outside {{the center of the}} city, except with special permission. Even though much of the area was <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>grazing</b> <b>land,</b> by the 1780s there were approx. 1,000 inhabitants of the area, {{as well as a number}} of commercial enterprises (lumberyards, tobacco farm, several industrial buildings), and the house of the Royal Copenhagen Shooting Society and Danish Brotherhood (‘’Det kongelige kjøbenhavnske Skydeselskab og danske Broderskabs’’). The society received permission to build outside the old city limits in the 1750s, and the building has housed the Copenhagen City Museum since 1956.|$|R

50|$|From {{the time}} of the Anza {{expedition}} until the Mexican Rancho Period, the land around Upland was <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>grazing</b> <b>land</b> by the San Gabriel Mission. Under mission rule, cattle ranching became a major industry. The rangy cattle thrived and bred rapidly in the benign climate, and thousands of cattle wandered across the Cucamonga Rancho. Following the secularization of the missions by the Mexican government, the Cucamonga Rancho was granted to Tiburcio Tapia in 1839. Upon the death of Tapia in 1845, the Rancho passed to his daughter and her husband, Leon V. Prudhomme. An 1886 report by the California Surveyor General listed the size of the Cucamonga Rancho as 13,045 acres.|$|R
50|$|There {{are small}} glades in the {{hawthorn}} and blackthorn thickets in Back Common which indicates this area's past <b>use</b> <b>as</b> common <b>grazing</b> <b>land.</b> The rough {{banks in the}} north of the reserve have a typical limestone grassland flora including wild thyme, common rock-rose and early-purple orchid.|$|R
25|$|During {{the period}} of {{dereliction}} much of the garden (including kitchen gardens and greenhouses to the north) became severely overgrown, and the parkland was <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>grazing</b> <b>land</b> (with the Library employed as a grain store). Much of the ornamental garden {{to the south and}} east has been restored and replanted, with work done by volunteers from the National Trust Activities Group (NTAG) and the London Wildlife Trust (and, in the replanting of trees, by the Stanley Smith Horticultural Trust, the Men of the Trees, the Countryside Commission and the South East Electricity Board after the Great Storm of 1987). Forming part of the High Weald AONB since October 1983, the parkland and gardens were given Grade II listed status in 1987.|$|R

50|$|Before {{it was a}} {{national}} park, the area was <b>used</b> largely <b>as</b> <b>grazing</b> <b>land</b> for domestic animals. The conditions in the park are very harsh, but several pioneering families lived there, and remnants of their occupation remain. Sheep and cattle continued to graze on the plateau until around the 1950s. It was an isolated place, and the stockmen {{in charge of the}} cattle often would not see another human for months at a time.|$|R
50|$|Settlement of {{the area}} dates to the 1830s when Tarneit was <b>used</b> <b>as</b> {{agricultural}} <b>grazing</b> <b>land.</b> Tarneit was named when it was surveyed in 1839 - 1840 and comes from the Wathaurong word for the colour white.
