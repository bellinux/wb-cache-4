5|$|During {{the initial}} {{stage of the}} voyage to Antarctica from Buenos Aires, he was kept busy {{with a number of}} routine tasks. He worked on the pram dinghy Nancy Endurance; made a small chest of drawers for Shackleton; {{specimen}} shelves for the biologist, Robert Clark; instrument cases for Leonard Hussey, the meteorologist; and put <b>up</b> <b>wind</b> screens to protect the helmsman. He constructed a false deck, extending from the poop-deck to the chart-room to cover the extra coal that the ship had taken on board. He also acted as the ship's barber. As the ship pushed into the pack ice in the Weddell Sea it became increasingly difficult to navigate. McNish constructed a six-foot wooden semaphore on the bridge to enable the navigating officer to give the helmsman directions, and built a small stage over the stern to allow the propeller to be watched in order to keep it clear of the heavy ice.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight of}} the {{fieldfare}} is slow and direct. It takes several strong beats then closes its wings briefly before flapping on. It is highly gregarious, quite shy and easily scared {{in the winter and}} bold and noisy in the breeding season. When a group is in a tree they all tend to face in the same direction, keeping up a constant chatter. When foraging on the ground, often in association with redwings, the group works its way <b>up</b> <b>wind,</b> each bird pausing every so often to stand erect and gaze around before resuming feeding. When alarmed they fly off down wind and the feeding group reforms elsewhere. In woodland they do not skulk in the undergrowth as do blackbirds or song thrushes, instead they perch in the open on bushes and high branches. They roost socially, sometimes in overgrown hedges and shrubberies but usually on the ground. Common sites are in rough grass among bushes or clumps of rushes, in young plantations, on stubble and in the furrows of ploughed fields.|$|E
2500|$|Carpenter {{immediately}} {{secured the}} area and pitched a number of tents <b>up</b> <b>wind</b> nearby. The wounded men were carefully carried there for more healthy air and the dead men were buried to reduce the stench and possibility of disease. Twenty-six hours later, [...] Carpenter sent a detachment to look for Bankhead's unit. They found Stilwell and Trudeau several miles in advance of Bankhead. Captain Bankhead followed bringing with him the two troops of the 2nd Cavalry.|$|E

25|$|An {{accounting}} period ends {{and a new}} one begins with the commencement of a <b>winding</b> <b>up.</b> For this purpose a <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> is taken to commence on the passing of a resolution for the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of the company, or on the presentation of a <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> petition if no such resolution has previously been passed and a <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> order is made on the petition, or on the doing of any other act for a like purpose {{in the case of}} a <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> otherwise than under the Insolvency Act 1986.|$|R

25|$|During {{the course}} of a <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> a company may make an {{estimate}} of when it will be wound up so that it can prepare tax returns for its final accounting period before that period ends. If the date assumed for the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> turns out to be before the actual <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> then an accounting period ends on the date assumed for the <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> a new accounting period starts, and the immediately preceding paragraph applies as if the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> had started with that accounting period.|$|R

60|$|And so {{they came}} to a small gate which let into the castle wall where the shadow of a great tower made the {{blackness}} of a black night doubly black. Through many dim corridors, the lackey led them, and <b>up</b> <b>winding</b> stairways until presently he stopped before a low door.|$|R

Of this fact he is perfectly aware, but he always makes the most of his natural gifts. For instance, when he lies down he invariably does so with his head down wind. Thus, if any enemy crosses his wind he will {{still be able to}} escape, or attack him; and if, on the other hand, the danger approaches <b>up</b> <b>wind</b> he will at least have a chance of seeing it. Otherwise, by walking delicately, one might actually kick him up like a partridge, if only the advance was made <b>up</b> <b>wind.</b>|$|E

40|$|I have {{my thesis}} {{dividend}} into two parts. In {{the first part}} (theory) I tried to draw up the legal background of the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of the commercial company, then I aimed to general aspects of the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> with liquidation (general reasons for <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> liquidator, insolvency proceeding), specifics of the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> with liquidation appertaining to particular type of commercial company and finally I described the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of the company with the legal successor (legal forms of conversions). In the second part I made up an imaginary limited lability company (I couldn't get any real dates from the existing company because they are all subject of business secret) and tried to illustrate the process of <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of the company with liquidation. I put emphasis on particular steps of liquidator and the formal standpoints of the liquidation process...|$|R
50|$|Ungoed Thomas J {{held that}} the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> {{petition}} could not succeed. It would be an abuse of process {{to ask for a}} <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> petition when a debt was bona fide under dispute.

5000|$|On 4 June, the {{barometer}} reading {{began to}} drop; and <b>winds</b> picked <b>up.</b> <b>Winds</b> reached 70 knots (130 km/h) by 06:00, and Twining again faced the might of a typhoon but emerged undamaged and resumed her picket duties {{late in the}} day.

60|$|Again {{and again}} was the awful sound {{repeated}} {{and each time}} she was certain that it came nearer. She could locate the direction of this sound although she could not that of the guns, for {{the origin of the}} former was much closer.

60|$|As {{she spoke}} {{a cloud of}} smoke arose above the man, and {{presently}} the loud report of a roer reached their ears. One of the buck rolled over and lay struggling on the ground, while the rest, together with many others at a distance, turned and galloped off this way and that, frightened by this new and terrible noise. The old rhinoceros under the tree rose snorting, sniffed the air, then thundered away <b>up</b> <b>wind</b> towards the man, its pig-like tail held straight above its back.|$|E
60|$|Pan-at-lee, {{descended from}} a long line of hunters, assumed that Tarzan would move <b>up</b> <b>wind</b> and in this {{direction}} she sought his tracks, which she soon found well marked, since he had made no effort to conceal them. She moved rapidly until she reached the point at which Tarzan had taken to the trees. Of course she knew what had happened; since her own people were semi-arboreal; but she could not track him through the trees, having no such well-developed sense of scent as he.|$|E

60|$|Amidships, {{squatting}} on {{the deck}} near the sky-light, he investigated several of the boat's crew and Lerumie. He identified them circumspectly, going suddenly stiff-legged as Lerumie made a low, hissing, menacing noise. Aft, at the wheel, he found a black steering, and, near him, the mate keeping the watch. Just as the mate spoke to him and stooped to pat him, Jerry whiffed Skipper somewhere near at hand. With a conciliating, apologetic bob of his tail, he trotted on <b>up</b> <b>wind</b> and came upon Skipper on his back, rolled in a blanket so that only his head stuck out, and sound asleep.|$|E
60|$|The {{youth and}} the ape had {{traveled}} slowly {{and with no}} precautions against a successful pursuit. Nor was their attitude of careless indifference to the blacks at all remarkable. So many similar raids had gone unpunished that the two had come to look upon the Negroes with contempt. The return journey led them straight <b>up</b> <b>wind.</b> The result being that the scent of their pursuers was borne away from them, so they proceeded upon their way in total ignorance {{of the fact that}} tireless trackers but little less expert in the mysteries of woodcraft than themselves were dogging their trail with savage insistence.|$|E

50|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Eric Welch.
