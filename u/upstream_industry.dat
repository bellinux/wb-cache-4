40|$|International audienceThis paper {{explores the}} {{heterogeneous}} productivity impact of trade, product market and financial market policies {{over the last}} decade in China. The paper makes a critical distinction between downstream and <b>upstream</b> <b>industries,</b> focusing on the indirect effects of regulation in <b>upstream</b> <b>industries</b> on firm performance in downstream manufacturing industries. We identify the differential effect of these policies on firm productivity growth depending on how far incumbents are relative to the technological frontier. Trade and product market reforms are found to deliver stronger gains for firms that are closer to the industry-level technological frontier, while the reverse holds for financial market reforms. The key conclusion that can be derived from the empirical analysis is that further product, trade and financial market reforms would bring substantial gains in China and could therefore speed up the convergence process. Taken at face value, the empirical estimates would imply that aligning product, trade and financial market regulation to the average level observed in OECD countries would bring aggregate manufacturing productivity gains of respectively 9 %, 3 % and 6. 5 % after 5 years...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This study {{examines}} whether {{the degree of}} spillovers from foreign direct investment {{is affected by the}} foreign ownership share in investment projects. The analysis, based on an unbalanced panel of Romanian firms during 1998 - 2000, produces evidence consistent with positive intra-sectoral spillovers resulting from fully-owned foreign affiliates but not from projects with joint domestic and foreign ownership. This finding is in line with the literature suggesting that foreign investors tend to put more resources into technology transfer to their wholly-owned projects than to those owned partially. Further, the data indicate that the presence of partially foreign-owned projects is correlated with higher productivity of domestic firms in <b>upstream</b> <b>industries</b> suggesting that domestic suppliers benefit from contacts with multinational customers. The opposite is true, however, in the case of fully-owned foreign affiliates which appear to {{have a negative effect on}} domestic firms in <b>upstream</b> <b>industries.</b> These results are consistent with the observation that foreign investors entering a host country through greenfield projects are less likely to source locally than those engaged in joint ventures or partial acquisitions. They are also in line with the evidence suggesting that fully-owned foreign subsidiaries use newer or more sophisticated technologies than jointly owned investment projects and thus may have higher requirements vis-à-vis suppliers...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the knowledge retrieval networks behind the adoption of farm biogas in an area of Mediterranean Europe featuring arable farming systems. The overarching objective of the analysis is to help and understand the interplay between biogas adopters and the stakeholders of the Agricultural Knowledge and Innovations System (AKIS). Specifically, the paper proposes an application of social network analysis that aims at bringing out the influence of knowledge exchanged within the system on adopters' business decisions, as well as adopters' contribution to knowledge upgrading. Social network analysis focuses on the estimation of three network attributes (cohesion, knowledge co-creation, and brokerage) using primary data, collected in 2015 via questionnaire to plant adopters. Self-education, <b>upstream</b> <b>industry,</b> agronomists, farmer/biogas unions, university, public-funded projects, and public research centers are AKIS’ stakeholders, which adopters turn to when seeking for information and/or know-how. <b>Upstream</b> <b>industry</b> is the most influential node and the one that can help knowledge diffusion across adopters, regardless of their background. Self-accessible resources are major providers of information at the adoption-decision stage. The networks are centralized on self-education tools, while <b>upstream</b> <b>industry</b> and the Research Center on Animal Productions are the brokers. Policy intervention aimed at improving AKIS in the biogas sector should involve the <b>upstream</b> <b>industry</b> in decision-making, while considering the duality of self-accessible information vs. physical advisors. This paper shows evidence from a region where public incentives have allowed biogas diffusion, despite the region not being intrinsically suitable for it.
