Avalanche multiplication is a statistical process and hence leads to carrier generation fluctuation which leads to excess noise in the avalanche multiplied photocurrent. The excess noise of SAM-SAPDs {{is an important issue}} in improving device characteristic and the relationships between excess noise factor (Fe) and mean multiplication (Me) will be described in our research. In this study, the theoretical relationships of (Fe) vs. Me for these SAM-SAPDs are simulated using the formulas presented by Shih. Several amorphous SAM-SAPD fabricated by Chiu, with different amorphous silicon-alloy layers in multiplication region are employed for discussing the relationships between Fe vs. Me. Chiu also presented experimental results of Fe vs. Me for these SAM-SAPDs. According to the optical gap diagrams of these devices, the electron ionization coefficients (α) and hole ionization coefficients (β) of each substage layer are estimated. The ratio of β to α is defined as ionization rate ratios (ks). In this study, ks is selected in theoretical calculations developed in this research to fit with the experimental results provided by Chiu. A quite consistence result is obtained to understand avalanche process in these SAM-SAPDs.

Sometime in June 1943, Himmler issued the Bandenbekämpfung (bandit fighting) order, simultaneously announcing {{the existence of the}} Bandenkampfverbände (bandit fighting formations), with SS-Obergruppenführer Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski as its chief. Employing troops primarily from the SS police and Waffen-SS, the Bandenkampfverbände had four principal operational components: propaganda, centralized control and coordination of security operations, training of troops, and battle operations. Once the Wehrmacht had secured territorial objectives, the Bandenkampfverbände first secured communications facilities, roads, railways, and waterways. Thereafter, they secured rural communities and economic installations such as factories and administrative buildings. An additional priority was securing agricultural and forestry resources. The SS oversaw the collection of the harvest, which was deemed critical to strategic operations. Any Jews in the area were rounded up and killed.
