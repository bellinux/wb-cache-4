25|$|In South Africa, {{circular}} migration exists {{in part because}} of the population mobility associated with Apartheid. Cheap labor for men existed primarily in mines and industry in urban areas, pulling men from rural areas around the country. However, their family members who were unemployed were legally bound to remain their rural villages, thus establishing a pattern of {{circular migration}} that continues to this day. These mining and industrial centers attract workers from rural areas within South Africa, as well as rural areas in neighboring countries. There is a minimum of 2.5 million legal migrants, though the number of <b>undocumented</b> <b>workers</b> is likely very high. 55% of households in 2001 had at least one temporary migrant.|$|E
25|$|Even when undocumented {{individuals}} are employed, their positions are often precarious. Approximately 40% of immigrant workers in low-wage jobs are undocumented. A lack of formal documentation means {{that many of}} these individuals must find work in the informal economy where {{there is a lack of}} protection for worker rights. <b>Undocumented</b> <b>workers</b> may have difficulty obtaining justice in cases of mistreatment since employers can easily threaten them with deportation. This leaves these immigrant workers vulnerable to exploitation. Exploitation may take many forms, one of these being wage theft. While there are regulations to protect the rights of workers, such as laws that cover private domestic work, these policies are often underutilized since workers may be unaware of their existence. Individuals who lack formal documentation may also feel less empowered to seek legal recourse because of fear of having their undocumented status made known.|$|E
25|$|According to NPR in 2005, about 3% {{of illegal}} {{immigrants}} were working in agriculture. The H-2A visa allows U.S. employers to bring foreign nationals to the United States to fill temporary agricultural jobs. The passing of tough immigration laws in several states from around 2009 provides a number of practical case studies. The state of Georgia passed immigration law HB 87 in 2011; this led, according to the coalition of top Kansas businesses, to 50% of its agricultural produce being left to rot in the fields, {{at a cost to}} the state of more than $400 million. Overall losses caused by the act were $1 billion; it was estimated that the figure would become over $20 billion if all the estimated 325,000 <b>undocumented</b> <b>workers</b> left Georgia.

2500|$|Truesdale {{played a}} key role in several {{important}} decisions during his term on the Board. Among these were Makro, Inc., 316 NLRB 109 (1995) (better known as Loehmann's Plaza II), in which the Board reversed a precedent (Makro, Inc., 305 N.L.R.B. 663 , also known as Loehmann's Plaza I) established just four years earlier and denied union picketers the right to access an employer's property; Oakland Mall, 316 NLRB 1160 (1995), also known as Oakland Mall II, in which the Board held that nonemployee handbilling on behalf of a labor union may not occur on an employer's property; Leslie Homes, Inc., 316 NLRB 123 (1995), aff'd Metropolitan District Council of Philadelphia and Vicinity United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, AFL-CIO v. NLRB, 68 F.3d 71 (3d. Cir. 1995), in which the Board held that a union may not picket on land occupied by homes being sold by a real estate developer. He also voted with the majority in important cases (California Saw & Knife Works, 320 NLRB 224 , Paperworkers Local 1033 (Weyerhaeuser Paper Co.), 320 NLRB 349 [...] ) involving the rights of workers who are not union members as established in Communications Workers of America v. Beck, 487 U.S. 735 (1988). California Saw was the NLRB's first ruling in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Beck. Truesdale and the majority held that whenever a union seeks to make employees pay dues under a union security agreement, it must inform all workers that they have the legal right to remain a non-member of the union and to pay only such fees as may be used for collective bargaining purposes (and no more). Paperworkers Local 1033 (Weyerhaeuser Paper Co.) addressed issues which California Saw did not, and Truesdale and the Board unanimously held that a union must inform all bargaining unit members (not just existing nonmembers) of their Beck rights and that they must inform all union members that they have the right to become a nonmember. In Canteen Co., 317 NLRB 1052 (1995), enf'd. 103 F.2d 1355 (7th Cir. 1997), Truesdale joined with the majority in a major new ruling on successorship. [...] In Fall River Dyeing & Finishing Corp. v. NLRB, 482 U.S. 27 (1987), the Supreme Court had held that if a one company succeeds another, it has a duty to bargain with the previous company's union if there is a substantial continuity between the two companies and the new company retains at least 50 percent of the workforce. Joining an opinion written by Gould, Truesdale held that the duty to bargain was not sundered by the employer's decision to change wage rates or benefit levels. In Keeler Brass Automotive group, 317 NLRB 1110 (1995), Gould convinced Truesdale and Cohen to change their vote and form a five-member majority in holding that a grievance committee is not a labor organization under the NLRA and hence cannot be a [...] "company union" [...] (even if employer-dominated). In A.P.R.A. Fuel Oil Buyers Group, 320 NLRB 408 (1995), Truesdale joined with Gould against Democratic Member Peggy Browning to interpret the Supreme Court's ruling in Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467 U.S. 883 (1984). [...] The Court had held in Sure-Tan that <b>undocumented</b> <b>workers</b> are entitled to back pay awards under the NLRA. In A.P.R.A. Fuel Oil, the collective bargaining agreement required the employer to reinstate laid-off workers first when it begins hiring again. If there were no dismissed workers available, then the employer was required to hire union-referred workers. [...] The union asserted that this included <b>undocumented</b> <b>workers.</b> But Truesdale and the majority held that the Board has no authority to force an employer to hire such <b>undocumented</b> <b>workers.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Domestic {{servitude}} is {{the forced}} employment of someone as a maid or nanny, and victims are often migrant women {{who come from}} low-wage communities in their home countries.

[...] Domestic workers are commonly US citizens, <b>undocumented</b> <b>workers</b> or foreign nationals most commonly holding {{one of the following}} visa types: A-3, G-5,NATO-7 or B-1 [...] The most common victims of this type of trafficking are women. Similar means of control to Agricultural Work are common. [...] Additionally, a lack of legislation regarding the duties and protection of these workers facilitates their exploitation. [...] Employers commonly use the workers lack of knowledge of the language or legal system as a means of control and intimidation. This is also commonly paired with various forms of abuse and/or passport revocation. [...] Many domestic workers are brought to the United States on a promise of a better life or an education. [...] Traffickers are usually married couples from the same country of origin as the trafficked person, and are usually not involved in organized criminal networks, making it more difficult to identify instances of this type of trafficking. Perpetrators of domestic servitude are often well-respected members of their communities and lead otherwise normal lives. Areas with large middle-class and upper-middle-class populations are commonly the destinations of this type of trafficking.|$|E

40|$|This article {{considers}} recent legal {{developments on}} <b>undocumented</b> migrant <b>workers,</b> finds {{the acceptance of}} international legal standards unsatisfactory and argues that the private law rights derived from the "semi-legal" employment contract between the employer and the <b>undocumented</b> migrant <b>worker</b> generates a solid base for significant legal claims. It further monitors {{the promotion of the}} position of the <b>undocumented</b> migrant <b>workers</b> under recent EU law and calls for a re-focusing on the employment contract in the reading of a relevant EC Directive, with a particular emphasis on the issue of access to justice for the migrant workers. The increased number of undocumented migrants who leave their countries of origin for reasons outside the scope of the asylum procedure, as well as the circumstances under which this migration is undertaken and the working conditions of these individuals in the host countries, have brought about legal activities from governments and institutions such as the EU. The aim has in general been to establish sanctions against employers of <b>undocumented</b> migrant <b>workers,</b> but a shift towards a compensatory, employee protective, attitude has recently emerged, both in EU legislation and in a broader perspective in US case law. The article concludes that such a development must be massively supported in relation to access to justice in order to fulfill the ambition. The poor legal position of the <b>undocumented</b> migrant <b>workers</b> is significantly connected to issues of legal representation, trade union participation and the threat of repatriation...|$|R

2500|$|Most of {{the victims}} that are {{currently}} working under forced labor conditions are doing so because they were either mislead about job opportunities or were enslaved or forced to against their will. According to a policy brief on human trafficking in Southeast Asia, although victims include girls, women, boys, and men the majority are women. Women {{tend to be more}} highly targeted by traffickers {{due to the fact that}} they are seeking opportunity in an area of the world where limited economic opportunities are available for them. Unskilled and poorly educated women are commonly led into human trafficking. According to the UNODC report, the numbers for women and men in forced labor may be skewed due to the fact that only a few countries released the numbers for adult men. The forced labor market in this region also is dominated by male adults and females while the trade of children is evident it is considered small in comparison to the total. [...] Most of these workers are undocumented and from different countries of origin than the country they work in. Countries like Thailand and Laos attract migrants of similar cultural backgrounds and language. Ethnic majority migrants from Laos are attracted to the similarities between the two countries and migrate to Thailand where they can assimilate easily. The combination of <b>undocumented</b> <b>workers</b> and similar cultures can cause problems for authorities to properly document and estimate the number of trafficked persons without confusing them for illegal immigrants and locals.|$|E
