25|$|Carved Stone Balls {{found at}} various sites in Scotland, {{northern}} England and north eastern Ireland. Spirals and rings of concentric circles carved {{on the balls}} {{can be found on}} standing stones and megalithic structures of the same period. Sites such as Maughanby Circle and Newgrange were designed to monitor the movements of the sun with special emphasis on the winter solstice. The connection with megalithic art infers these carved stone balls had significant cultural importance to the pre-Celtic people who made them. They thought in a symbolic way and displayed ceremonial behaviour we may look <b>upon</b> <b>today</b> as religious. No written records exist for the Neolithic people of Britain and Ireland. From reading the archaeology it has not been possible to determine whether these peoples understood the concept of a ball game. However, as playing ball games feature in later religious festivities including Christmastide which coincides with Yuletide, the winter solstice and the Pagan rebirth of the sun the possibility cannot be ruled out.|$|E
500|$|Wolfenstein 3D (created by id Software and {{released}} in 1992) {{was an instant}} success, fueled largely by its shareware release, and has been credited with inventing the first-person shooter genre.

500|$|In a 2009 {{report of}} a 2006 trip, {{botanist}} Andreas Fleischmann noted that the higher altitude site is overgrown with plants of the family Restionaceae {{and he could not}} locate any remaining D.regia. The lower altitude site was in a similar state, but he recorded approximately 50 mature plants, making this one of the most critically endangered Drosera species. While D.regia has not been evaluated under the current International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) standards for a rating on the Red List of Threatened Species, the International Carnivorous Plant Society recognised D.regia on their list of imperiled carnivorous plant species. Droseraregia was also listed as [...] "rare" [...] on an early IUCN report in 1997, but these earlier IUCN assessments were often poorly documented and are thus not relied <b>upon</b> <b>today.</b> Several other authors have identified how rare D.regia is in the wild, even calling it [...] "threatened with extinction".|$|E

This is a process known as [...] "stretching" [...] or [...] "cutting in" [...] the wine. During the 18th century, Bordeaux wine producers would often import wine from Spain, Rhone or the Languedoc to blend and stretch out their wine which they sold to the English as claret. While this practice would be frowned <b>upon</b> <b>today</b> by Bordeaux authorities, the French wine writer André Jullien noted that some merchants believed this practice was necessary in order for the claret to be agreeable with English tastes—a practice he describes as [...] "travail à l'anglaise".|$|E
2500|$|The sex {{industry}} emerged in Southeast Asia {{in the mid}} 20th century {{as a way for}} women to generate more income for struggling migrants and locals trying to support families or themselves. Nicola Piper claims the industry's growth throughout the region can be attributed to growing tourism and military bases that dotted the region during times of major wars. Sex industries first catered to military personnel on leave from bases but as military installations began to recede the industry turned its attention to growing tourism.

In addition to the human tragedy, total destruction was estimated in excess of $160 million (about $821 million in 2009 dollars), which included 1,335 homes and 5,000 automobiles that were destroyed. Runoff from this storm produced record floods (highest peak flows recorded) along Battle, Spring, Rapid, and Box Elder Creeks. Smaller floods also occurred along Elk Creek and Bear Butte Creek. Canyon Lake Dam, {{on the west side}} of Rapid City, broke the night of the flood, unleashing a wall of water down the creek. The 1972 flooding has an estimated recurrence interval of 500 years, which means that a flood of this magnitude will occur on average once every 500 years. Every year there is a 0.2 percent chance (1 in 500) of experiencing a similar event. To prevent a similar tragedy from occurring in the future, the city's flood plain is no longer allowed to be built <b>upon.</b> <b>Today</b> the flood plain features golf courses, parks, sports arenas, and arboretums where neighborhoods and businesses once stood.|$|E
