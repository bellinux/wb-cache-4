50|$|<b>Umespirone</b> (KC-9172) {{is a drug}} of the azapirone class which {{possesses}} anxiolytic and antipsychotic properties. It behaves as a 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist (Ki = 15 nM), D2 receptor partial agonist (Ki = 23 nM), and Î±1-adrenoceptor receptor antagonist (Ki = 14 nM), {{and also}} has weak affinity for the sigma receptor (Ki = 558 nM). Unlike many other anxiolytics and antipsychotics, <b>umespirone</b> produces minimal sedation, cognitive/memory impairment, catalepsy, and extrapyramidal symptoms.|$|E
50|$|Azapirones {{are poorly}} but {{nonetheless}} appreciably absorbed {{and have a}} rapid onset of action, but have only very short half-lives ranging from 1-3 hours. As a result, they must be administered 2-3 times a day. The only exception to this rule is <b>umespirone,</b> which has a very long duration with a single dose lasting as long as 23 hours. Unfortunately, <b>umespirone</b> has not been commercialized. Although never commercially produced, Bristol-Myers Squibb applied for a patent on Oct 28, 1993 and received the patent on Jul 11, 1995 for an extended release formulation of buspirone. An extended release formulation of gepirone is currently under development and if approved, should help to improve this issue.|$|E
