It {{was one of}} a series of very high dams built in Europe in the two decades after World War II; these were designed with a downstream face inclined toward the <b>upstream</b> <b>flow.</b> This simplified the dam's design and construction (although it required more concrete to build), and more readily incorporated the spillways into the dam face. The dam's face is nearly vertical. Design work on the dam began in 1956, and construction completed in 1963. The structure was built by the Iberdrola Ingeniería y Construcción construction firm. Pedro Martínez Artola was the design engineer. The dam was built on high-quality granite rock. During construction, grouting was used to fill cracks in the rock which ran parallel to the dam's foundation, and on the Portuguese bank where two fractures in the rock occurred.|$|E

5000|$|In general, a {{hydraulic}} jump is formed {{at a location}} where the upstream and downstream flow depths satisfy the conjugate depth equation. However, there can be conditions in a channel, such as downstream controls, that can alter where the conjugate depths form. Tailwater depth can play a very influential role on where the jump will occur in the channel, and changes in this depth can shift the jump either upstream or downstream. Figure 6 contains three scenarios of tailwater elevations (yd): yd [...] {{is equal to the}} conjugate depth (y2) of the <b>upstream</b> <b>flow</b> depth (y1), yd [...] is less than the conjugate depth (y2) of the <b>upstream</b> <b>flow</b> depth (y1), and yd [...] is greater than the conjugate depth (y2) of the <b>upstream</b> <b>flow</b> depth (y1). The upstream depth (y1) in all three cases is controlled by a sluice gate and remains constant. Its corresponding conjugate depth (y2) is shown by the dashed line in each of the scenarios.|$|E

The controller is represented as an infinite series and a statement about the convergence of this series is made. A comparison is made with controllers for thermal systems from a similar problem available in the literature.
