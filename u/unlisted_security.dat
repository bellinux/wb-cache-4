An overview of {{the historical development of}} the company which is parallel to the regulation of securities shows the crystallized principles which are compared against the development and enactment of the current regulatory regime. The concept of “complete law” as key element to effective regulation is discussed and applied in the review of Chapter 4 determining the effectiveness of the dispensation. The three determining concepts of regulation: the “offer,” “securities” and “public” are studied against the definitions which determine regulation and the inclusion of secondary market regulation of <b>unlisted</b> <b>securities.</b> Serious shortcomings in the process are identified. These errors, together with the practical problems of defining and regulating the secondary market in Chapter 4 read with the remainder of the delineating definitions, concludes that the current system is not in line with the principles of regulation and the Grundnorm of fraud prevention, resulting in Chapter 4 falling under the concept of “incomplete law” resulting in a high probability of enforcement failure and inefficiency.

40|$|Equity {{crowdfunding}} is {{a relatively}} new investment format that allows investors to purchase <b>unlisted</b> <b>securities</b> from a company that does not meet listing requirements for an initial public offering.

While the US and the UK have extensive crowdfunding regulations, Hong Kong does not, although crowdfunding is not specifically banned under the Securities and Futures Ordinance.

40|$|In trend with {{a global}} pattern and {{following}} recommendations of the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the number of stock markets in African countries has increased dramatically over the last ten years. Despite a scarcity of studies {{on the impact of}} stock markets on these economies, some policymakers have been arguing in favor of stock exchanges (national or regional) in eastern and southern Africa. The creation of such exchanges may be a premature project as they might lack an actual economic rationale. The present case study, for instance, suggests that the Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE) has little effect on the larger Zambian economy.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the factors affecting portfolio equity flows into India using monthly data. Flows to India are {{small compared to}} other emerging markets, but seem to be relatively less volatile. They also seem to be quite resilient. The paper shows that portfolio flows are determined by both external and domestic factors. Among external factors, LIBOR and emerging market stock returns are important, while the primary domestic determinants are the lagged stock return and changes in credit ratings. In quantitative terms, both external and domestic factors {{are found to be}} about equally important.
