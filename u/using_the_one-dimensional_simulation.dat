40|$|Thermal {{stratification}} The US Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station was {{tasked with}} evaluating {{the water temperature}} release capabilities of a proposed hydropower intake structure at Wynoochee Dam near Montesano, WA. The existing dam structure has passageways for juvenile fish migrating downstream and has flexible operation capabilities due to multilevel ports to meet downstream target temperatures. The hydropower developers have proposed a single wet well intake structure with two variable-opening gates. The study objective was to demonstrate {{the ability of the}} proposed structure to meet water temperature objectives at least equal to that of the existing structure. All objectives were accomplished by modifying and <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>one-dimensional</b> thermal <b>simulation</b> model, WESTEX. After verification of WESTEX to 2 years of historical temperature release data, prediction runs were made using an assumed range of intake loss coefficients and withdrawal angles for 3 years of data.

40|$|We {{present and}} discuss {{results of a}} new model for ion {{injections}} and acceleration at quasi-perpendicular collisionless shocks. We <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>one-dimensional</b> hybrid <b>simulation</b> (kinetic ions/fluid electrons) and impose an assumption on the ion motion so that diffusion across the magnetic field (normal to the shock front) is possible. These motions are otherwise suppressed by both one- and two-dimensional simulations. We find that, even in strictly perpendicular shocks, when scattering normal to the field is included, {{a fraction of the}} incident ions are accelerated to suprathermal energies. When reasonable scattering times are considered, only pickup ions are injected, whereas thermal solar wind ions are not. The acceleration of these ions is very rapid. We have found that a few of the initially low-energy pickup ions can reach many tens to a few hundred times the plasma ramming energy in less than 100 gyroperiods. Furthermore, highly field aligned energetic ions are found to exist upstream of the slightly oblique shock. The most direct applications of this study is toward the interpretation of observations of both solar wind and interstellar pickup ion distributions in the vicinity of interplanetary shocks which are most often quasi-perpendicular. This work also directly addresses a fundamental issue with regard to our current understanding of the anomalous component of cosmic rays...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of the {{acoustic}} source characteristics of internal combustion engines (IC-engines) {{is of great}} importance when designing the exhaust duct system and its components to withstand the resulting dynamic loads and to reduce the exhaust noise emission. Number of studies has been published earlier on the low frequency in-duct exhaust noise of high speed engines. The goal {{of the present study}} is to investigate the medium speed IC-engine acoustic source characteristics numerically and experimentally not only in the low frequency - plane wave range but also in the high frequency range. The low frequency acoustic source characteristics were predicted by simulating {{the acoustic}} multi-load measurements using a <b>one-dimensional</b> process <b>simulation</b> code. <b>The</b> engine model <b>used</b> in <b>the</b> <b>one-dimensional</b> process <b>simulations</b> was validated with measurements. In this study, it is shown that the low frequency in-duct exhaust noise of a medium speed IC-engine can be predicted quite accurately by using a onedimensional process simulation code. The high frequency source data is estimated by averaging the measured acoustic pressures with different methods. According to this study, <b>using</b> <b>the</b> simple cross spectra averaging method instead of two microphone method to estimate the induct downstream acoustic power of medium speed IC-engine exhaust noise seems promising.

40|$|Hydroelectric power plants' open-type {{surge tanks}} may {{be built in}} {{mountains}} subject to the provision of atmospheric air. Hence, a ventilation tunnel is indispensable. The air flow in the ventilation tunnel {{is associated with the}} fluctuation of water-level in the surge tank. There is a great relationship between the wind speed and <b>the</b> safe <b>use</b> and project investment of ventilation tunnels. To obtain the wind speed in a ventilation tunnel for a surge tank during transient processes, this article adopts <b>the</b> <b>one-dimensional</b> numerical <b>simulation</b> method and establishes a mathematical model of a wind speed by assuming the boundary conditions of air discharge for a surge tank. Thereafter, the simulation of wind speed in a ventilation tunnel, for the case of a surge tank during transient processes, is successfully realized. Finally, the effective mechanism of water-level fluctuation in a surge tank and the shape of the ventilation tunnel (including length, sectional area and dip angle) for the wind speed distribution and the change process are discovered. On the basis of comparison between the simulation results of 1 D and 3 D computational fluid dynamics (CFD), the results indicate that <b>the</b> <b>one-dimensional</b> <b>simulation</b> method as proposed in this article can be used to accurately simulate the wind speed in the ventilation tunnel of a surge tank during transient processes. The wind speed fluctuations can be superimposed by <b>using</b> <b>the</b> low frequency mass wave (i. e., fundamental wave) and the high frequency elastic wave (i. e., harmonic wave).

Localized reaction centers produce compression waves capable of conditioning the gas such that a finite amount of time elapses before spontaneous ignition occurs.

40|$|Using {{detailed}} kinetic {{models in}} {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) simulations is extremely challenging {{because of the large}} number of species that need to be considered and the stiffness of the associated set of differential equations. The high computational cost associated with using a detail-ea kinetic network in CFD <b>simulations</b> is why <b>one-dimensional</b> <b>simulations</b> are still used, although this leads to substantial differences compared to reference three-dimensional simulations. Therefore, a methodology was developed that,allows one to use, detailed single-event microkinetic Models in CFD simulations by on the fly application of the pseudo-steady-state assumption to the radical reaction intermediates. Depending on the reaction model size, a speed-up factor of More than 50 was obtained compared to the standard ANSYS Fluent routines without losing accuracy.
