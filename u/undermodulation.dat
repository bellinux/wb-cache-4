50|$|While {{clipping}} limiters {{are often}} used {{as a form of}} last-ditch protection against overmodulation, a properly designed vogad circuit actively controls the amount of gain to optimise the modulation depth in real time. As well as preventing overmodulation, it boosts the level of quiet signals so that <b>undermodulation</b> is also avoided. <b>Undermodulation</b> can lead to poor signal penetration in noisy conditions, consequently vogad is particularly important for voice applications such as radiotelephones.|$|E
40|$|COMpensator) is {{increasingly}} popular in Power System applications. In general, power factor {{and stability of}} the utility system can be improved by STATCOM. Specially, STATCOM can stabilize a given node voltage and compensate the power factor {{of the system and}} also load by that node. The steady state and dynamic performance of STATCOM are very critical to the performance of the power system. These performances depend on the modulation index of the converter. The concept of SVPWM (Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation) is extended, in principle, for the inverter switching of STATCOM. The SVPWM gives a greater value of modulation factor in the <b>undermodulation</b> as well as the overmodulation range compared to Sine PWM (SPWM). A PI and an H Controller have been designed for closed-loop control of the system. It is found through simulation that, H controller gives better responses than PI controller...|$|E
40|$|With the aim to {{implement}} a suitable controller for a three-phase dc-ac multilevel active-clamped converter to enable its use in practice, and {{as a first step}} toward a full closed-loop converter control implementation into a single field-programmable gate array (FPGA) device, this paper presents the structure and features of an FPGA implementation of an appropriate pulsewidth modulation (PWM) strategy. The selected PWM strategy guarantees dc-link capacitor voltage balance in every switching cycle, and covers both the <b>undermodulation</b> and overmodulation regions. A flexible implementation is conceived, allowing the variation of important operating parameters, such as the modulation index and switching frequency, through a simple user interface. The key aspects to achieve an efficient and robust FPGA implementation are discussed. Experimental results in a four-level converter prototype controlled with an Altera Cyclone III device under different operating conditions match fairly well with the expected results obtained through simulation, thus verifying the accurate performance of the FPGA-based modulatorPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|Author for Correspondence A {{voltage source}} {{inverter}} (VSI) is commonly used to supply a three-phase induction motor with variable frequency and variable voltage for variable speed applications. Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Control technique is an excellent control strategy to control various parameters in an induction motor. A number of Pulse width modulation (PWM) schemes are used to obtain variable voltage and frequency supply. The most widely used PWM schemes for three-phase {{voltage source inverter}}s are carrier-based sinusoidal PWM and space vector PWM (SVPWM). In PWM, three phase reference modulating signals are compared against a common triangular carrier to generate the PWM signals for the three phases. In SVPWM methods, a revolving reference voltage vector is provided as voltage reference instead of three phase modulating waves. There is an increasing trend of using space vector PWM (SVPWM) because of their easier digital realization and better dc bus utilization. The Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation of a three level inverter provides the additional advantage of superior harmonic quality and larger <b>undermodulation</b> range that extends the modulation factor to 90. 7 % from the traditional value of 78. 5 % in Sinusoida...|$|E
40|$|Background: Posttraumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) and depression are common among populations displaced due to large-scale political conflicts and war. Objective: The {{aim of this}} study is to investigate the prevalence and gender-based differences in symptoms of PTSD and depression among Iraqi Yazidis displaced into Turkey. Method: The study was conducted on 238 individuals who were evaluated using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I) and the Stressful Life Events Screening Questionnaire. Results: Of the participants, 42. 9 % met the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for PTSD, 39. 5 % for major depression, and 26. 4 % for both disorders. More women than men suffered from PTSD and major depression. More women than men with PTSD or depression reported having experienced or witnessed the death of a spouse or child. Women with PTSD reported flashbacks, hypervigilance, and intense psychological distress due to reminders of trauma more frequently than men. Men with PTSD reported feelings of detachment or estrangement from others more frequently than women. More depressive women than men reported feelings of guilt or worthlessness. Conclusions: PTSD and major depression affected women more frequently than men. While women tended to respond to traumatic stress by <b>undermodulation</b> of emotions and low self-esteem, men tended to respond by overmodulation of emotions. Rather than being a derivative of sex differences, this complementary diversity in response types between genders seems to be shaped by social factors in consideration of survival under extreme threat...|$|E
