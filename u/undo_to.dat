Although this new party was more nationalistic and authoritarian, it was legal and continued UNDO's opposition to the terrorism of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists. [...] Because the Poles were only willing to apply concessions to Galicia, and not to Volhynia, UNDO's leader Dmytro Levytsky resigned from his post as head of the party. While not resigning from the party itself, he went into internal opposition. Levytsky was supported by many of UNDO's members and by the editorial board of the newspaper Dilo. This split incapacitated the party. Levytsky was replaced as head of the party by Vasyl Mudry, who became speaker of the Polish parliament.|$|E

Introduction Weikum presented a multi-level transaction model [1, 18], which has received considerable attention for designing high performance transaction processing and concurrency control algorithms [2, 15, 16,].

40|$|We {{present a}} set of new {{operations}} for managing screen real estate that allow windows to acquire more desktop space. This set of operations obeys the following guidelines: (1) the visible information contents of each window are preserved (i. e., operations never result in covering already-exposed window contents), (2) operation invocation requires only simple user action, and (3) windows grow and move in a natural and easily understandable manner, mimicking the interactions of colliding physical objects. We call the main operations expand and shove. Expand and shove represent two endpoints on a space-acquisition scale, and we give other possible operations called jostle and ram that fall between these two points. Additional concepts of <b>undo</b> (<b>to</b> allow windows to revert to earlier sizes and positions) and relevant regions (to allow more tightly controlled window information regions to be indicated) are also introduced. To theoretically support the methods used by the operations, we present a classification of the possible ways that pairs of windows can initially overlap and subsequently interact during the operations...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to clarify the social phases of schools in the Taisho era. They were the {{changing}} situations of schools which the interaction between the national values and people's values provided. Then, this paper pays attention to the turning point from CHIHO KAIRYO <b>UNDO</b> <b>to</b> MINRYOKU KANYO UNDO, because it had two notable facts. The first was that the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education began to differ in their policies of controlling people in the process of MINRYOKU KANYO UNDO, though they were in unanimous cooperation during the period of CHIHO KAIRYO UNDO. Though the Ministry of Interior held the traditional national value, the Ministry of Education took a critical attitude to it and put forward a new value. As a result, the national value became dual. The second fact is that a new value of people appeared in MINRYOKU KANYO UNDO, though people considered "IE" and "MURA" a unified value during the period of CHIHO KAIRYO UNDO. As consumption-oriented people appeared after World War I, the Ministry of Education presented a new value; "SEIKATSU" as one of ideal patterns of consumption-oriented people. There were different reactions to this "SEIKATSU" between urban areas and rural areas, and they made people's value dual. This meant not only the changes of the national and people's values but also the changes in the relations between nation and people, and actual situations of schools in the said era were changed in connection with those changes. Social phases of schools in the Taisho era were divided into two types. The first was the old type which subsumed people's values. Schools included the logic of "IE" and "MURA", and, for people, the participation in schools by themselves had the meaning of the formation of their value. In the Taisho era, however, a new social phase of schools was formed by the forthcoming of a new value, "SEIKATSU". As a result, schools did not subsume people's values, but they became a means to get the "SEIKATSU". This new phase had two types between urban areas and rural areas. The urban type was "the consumption of schools" for the purpose of getting "SEIKATSU". The rural type was "the production by schools". People in the rural area made use of schools to produce a rural "SEIKATSU" to make up for "SEIKATSU"...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 1998 Pacific Islands StudiesMy first {{encounter}} with Modekngei was {{in the summer of}} 1995 when I was introduced by my professor at the Center for the Pacific Islands Studies, University of Hawai'i. to an ethnographic monograph. written by a Japanese anthropologist. Machiko Aoyagi. 2 Being a Japanese woman, and a student who is interested in Belau/Palau,: 9 it was an exciting invitation for me to learn about Japanese ethnographic work, which, until then, I had not had a chance to study closely. In her book, Aoyagi describes Modekngei as a new religion, started by a shaman name Temedad from Chol village in Palau, that emerged around 1914 when the Japanese naval forces occupied the islands, formerly under the German administration. She mentions that there is an alternative interpretation made by an American anthropologist, Arthur J. Vidich, who characterizes Modekngei as an anti-Japanese political movement. 4 Her discussion of Vidich's account is brief (about five pages in Chapter 8 : Teikou <b>Undo</b> <b>to</b> Shite no Modekugei [Modekngei as a Resistant Movement]), 5 but it comes quite clear that she strongly disagrees with Vidich's perspective on Modekngei. Aoyagi argues that Vidich's research was conducted right after World War II, in an atmosphere where all Japanese were considered as criminals of war. 6 She speculates, therefore, that Palauan people provided the American ethnographer with what he wanted to hear and that Vidich himself could have selectively emphasized the anti-Japanese aspects of the movement. 7 With this criticism in mind, Aoyagi began her eleven-year research on Modekngei in 1973. From 1973 to 1984, she conducted her fieldwork in Palau with seven visits ranging in time from one to four months. e She points out that during her fieldwork, all her informants, both Modekngei followers and former policemen during the Japanese administration, testified to her that Modekngei was never an anti-Japanese movement. 9 By contrasting the statements of these Palauan people, she refutes Vidich's argument about the anti-Japanese nature of Modekngei. Aoyagi's account was intriguing to me in two ways; I sensed "something" strongly appealing to me about the nature of Modekngei, and at the same time, the discrepancies in interpretations and representations of a history of a social phenomenon, made by two scholars from two different nations, grabbed my interest. I eagerly read Vidich's account, which is precise and convincing in his argument and description of Modekngei as an anti-Japanese movement, and I was left with a ceaseless feeling of wonder. Why is it that Vidich's account is almost entirely absent of description of Modekngeis religious aspects? Why does Aoyagi discuss very little about the political nature of Modekngei? What was it that "actually" happened? Did Aoyagi inadvertently try to defend Japanese colonialism? Is Vidich a part of a typical "Japan bashing" discourse? Were Palauan people selective in giving information to Vidich as Aoyagi speculates? How about to Aoyagi? Why? In my mind, the entire issue was soon connected to assumptions that I was learning at that time in seminars: knowledge is power; all knowledge is political. Debates in the seminars concerned long held assumptions in the western scientific traditions. Search for the objective truth was one of them. Is there such thing as objective truth...|$|E
