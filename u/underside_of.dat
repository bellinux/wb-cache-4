5|$|Only the {{serrated}} {{and often}} keratinized {{tip of the}} sublingua is free to move small distances along the <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the tongue, {{while the majority of}} its length adheres to the <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the tongue. These free-moving folds or filaments are called the plica fimbriata and attach {{to the base of the}} sublingua and are supported at the midline by the plica mediana. The plica fimbriata is highly developed and specialized in lemurs, and makes up the majority of the sublingua.|$|E

5|$|The abdomen is {{long and}} slender and {{consists}} of 10 segments and a terminal appendage-bearing segment. The second and third segments are enlarged, and in males, a cleft on the <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the second segment contains a pair of claspers and the penis. The spermaries open on the 9th segment. In females, the genital opening is on the <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the eighth segment and is covered by a simple flap or an ovipositor, depending on species and the method of egg-laying.|$|E
5|$|The adult California condor is {{a uniform}} black with the {{exception}} of large triangular patches or bands of white on the <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the wings. It has gray legs and feet, an ivory-colored bill, a frill of black feathers surrounding the base of the neck, and brownish red eyes. The juvenile is mostly a mottled dark brown with blackish coloration on the head. It has mottled gray instead of white on the <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> its flight feathers.|$|E

5|$|Like other boletes, Boletus pinophilus has small pores on the <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> its cap {{rather than}} gills. These are {{coloured}} white at first, becoming yellow {{with age and}} olivaceous-brown at full maturity. The spores are cylindric-ellipsoid, smooth, with oil drops and dimensions 15.520 by 4.55.5µm. They produce an olive-brown spore print.|$|E
5|$|No fossil {{evidence}} of Dimetrodons skin {{has yet been}} found. Impressions of {{the skin of a}} related animal, Estemmenosuchus, indicate {{that it would have been}} smooth and well-provided with glands. Dimetrodon also may have had large scutes on the <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> its tail and belly, as other synapsids did.|$|E
5|$|The M249 is a belt-fed {{light machine}} gun. It fires the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge, usually a {{combination}} of one M856 tracer and four M855 ball cartridges fed from M27 linked belts. Belts are typically held in a hard plastic or soft canvas box attached to the <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the weapon.|$|E

5|$|This {{response}} {{lowers the}} surface area available to herbivores, which are presented with the <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> each leaflet, and results in a wilted appearance. It may also physically dislodge small herbivores, such as insects.|$|E
5|$|Ventral grooves {{run from}} the lower jaw to the umbilicus, about halfway along the <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the body. These grooves are less {{numerous}} (usually 14–22) than in other rorquals, but are fairly wide.|$|E
5|$|Ziphiids {{consist of}} 22 species of beaked whale. These vary from size, to coloration, to distribution, {{but they all}} share a similar hunting style. They use a suction technique, aided {{by a pair of}} grooves on the <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> their head, not unlike the throat pleats on the rorquals, to feed.|$|E

5|$|Cockroaches are {{generalized}} insects, {{with few}} special adaptations, {{and may be}} among the most primitive living neopteran insects. They have a relatively small head and a broad, flattened body, and most species are reddish-brown to dark brown. They have large compound eyes, two ocelli, and long, flexible antennae. The mouthparts are on the <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the head and include generalized chewing mandibles, salivary glands and various touch and taste receptors.|$|E
5|$|Down {{the middle}} of the sublingua is a thick {{strengthening}} rod called the plica mediana or lytta, which connects the sublingua to the <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the tongue, and is part of the lingual septum (septum of the tongue). The thickness and size of the plica mediana can vary between species, and except in treeshrews, it is cartilaginous and provides support for the sublingua.|$|E
5|$|In tarsiers, the sublingua {{does not}} have {{serrations}} along its tip and is much simpler and generalized in structure, making it clearly distinguishable {{from that of the}} lemuriform primates. The tarsier has a distinct plica mediana and its plicae fimbriatae are large and stick to the entire <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the tongue. The plica sublingualis is also prominent.|$|E

5|$|Mantas {{evolved from}} bottom-dwelling stingrays, {{eventually}} developing more wing-like pectoral fins. M. birostris {{still has a}} vestigial remnant of a sting barb {{in the form of}} a caudal spine. The mouths of most rays lie on the <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the head, while in mantas they are right at the front. Manta rays and devil rays are the only ray species that have evolved into filter feeders.|$|E
5|$|Many {{families}} of moths have special organs to help detect bat echolocation. These organs {{are known as}} tympana (singular – typanum). The Pyraloidea and almost all Geometroidea have tympana located on the anterior sternite of the abdomen. The Noctuoidea also have tympana, but in their case, the tympana are located on the <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the metathorax, the structure and position of which are unique and a taxonomic distinguishing feature of the superfamily.|$|E
5|$|Newcastle United hosted Chelsea at St James' Park in {{the fifth}} round of the competition. The home team came close to scoring after the midway point of the first half; Obafemi Martins's shot towards the Chelsea goal hit the <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the {{crossbar}} and bounced down, before the ball was cleared. In the 79th minute, Drogba – on as a substitute – scored the winning goal of the match, from a free-kick.|$|E
