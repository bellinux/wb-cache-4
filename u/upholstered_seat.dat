60|$|As Hopkins ran {{he became}} aware of a big, low, red, racing {{automobile}} that kept abreast of him in the street. This auto steered in {{to the side of the}} sidewalk, and the man guiding it motioned to Hopkins to jump into it.

The big machine, with a diminuendo cough, flew away like an albatross down the avenue into which the street emptied.|$|E
60|$|One: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms {{extended}} and back slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply <b>upholstered</b> <b>seat</b> a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration. The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame {{from top to}} seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush.|$|E

A minimalist frame was also adopted for the 675 Chair (1953), a dining chair with a slender floating moulded plywood seat back. In the Q Stak Chair (1954), Day’s first one-piece moulded plywood shell chair, the number of components was reduced to the bare minimum in order to keep costs down.|$|E

The Chair best {{represents}} Wegner's design {{philosophy of}} [...] "continuous purification...to cut {{down to the}} simplest possible elements of four legs, a seat, and a combined top rail and armrest" [...] The Chair was a collaboration of Wegner and furniture maker Johannes Hansen (now made by PP Mobler as models PP501/PP503). The construction features 11 pieces of wood joined by 12 mortise and tenons and two large finger joints. The finger joints orient the wood grain as the back rail wraps around the body to maximize material strength. The Chair was offered with a solid <b>upholstered</b> <b>seat,</b> or a seat of airy woven caning. It rose to prominence in the 1961 televised debate between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy. Both presidential candidates sat in The Chair during the debate.|$|E

40|$|X-radiography of textile objects reveals hidden {{features}} {{as well as}} unexpected components and materials. This non-destructive technique throws light on construction, manufacturing techniques, use, wear, repair, patterns of decay and dating. X-radiography improves artefact documentation and interpretation as well as guiding conservation approaches by enhancing understanding. This book explores techniques for X-raying textiles. It describes approaches to image interpretation and explains how, through digitisation and digital image manipulation, maximum information can be realised. Case studies include archaeological, ecclesiastical and ethnographic textiles, items of dress and accessories, upholstery, quilts, embroideries, dolls and toys. Museum professionals will find this stimulating book an essential guide for developing their own practice or commissioning textile X-radiographs. Audience Student and professional conservators working with textiles, or dealing with x-radiography of objects.
