25|$|The {{result was}} the New York Arbitration Act of 1920, {{followed}} by the United States Arbitration Act of 1925 (now known as the Federal Arbitration Act). Both made agreements to arbitrate valid and enforceable (unless one party could show fraud or <b>unconscionability</b> or some other ground for rescission which undermined {{the validity of the}} entire contract). Due to the subsequent judicial expansion of the meaning of interstate commerce, the U.S. Supreme Court reinterpreted the FAA in a series of cases in the 1980s and 1990s to cover almost the full scope of interstate commerce. In the process, the Court held that the FAA preempted many state laws covering arbitration, some of which had been passed by state legislatures to protect their consumers against powerful corporations.|$|E
25|$|Another {{issue as}} regards mutual wills is the {{question}} of revocability. In Re Hobley Charles Aldous QC held that there could be either unilateral or mutual revocation provided it occurred during the lifetime of both testators. However, the problem with this approach is that unilateral revocation is against the general principle of contract. Several explanations for this could be proffered. Firstly, there could be an implicit term that the agreement is revocable. Secondly, it could be conceptually viewed that the agreement takes on the revocable nature of the will to which it relates. Thirdly, as the doctrine is based on detrimental reliance, the agreement only concretized on the death of the other party. Fourthly, one could apply the <b>unconscionability</b> rationale that unjust enrichment could only be complete when one party takes a benefit under the will of the other party.|$|E

2500|$|The Court heard oral {{arguments}} on November 9, 2010. Justices Scalia and Sotomayor questioned Pincus (attorney for AT Mobility) about when <b>unconscionability</b> doctrines are made under state law. Pincus {{argued that the}} California law was not being applied uniformly. Scalia challenged that assertion when he asked, [...] "Are we {{going to tell the}} State of California what it has to consider unconscionable?". Other justices questioned different procedural issues arising from the <b>unconscionability</b> discussion and the scope of the rule AT was proposing. Deepak Gupta, representing the Concepcions, argued that the contract AT imposed on Respondents was clearly unfair. He asserted that state law should be a guidepost in these questions. Some of his arguments drew criticism from Chief Justice John Roberts. Gupta concluded by arguing that California [...] "has made a judgment that if you preclude class-wide relief... that will gut the State's substantive consumer protection laws..." ...|$|E
2500|$|If a {{contract}} is {{in a written}} form, and somebody signs it, then the signer is typically bound by its terms {{regardless of whether they}} have actually read it [...] provided the document is contractual in nature. However, affirmative defenses such as duress or <b>unconscionability</b> may enable the signer to avoid the obligation. Further, reasonable notice of {{a contract}}'s terms must be given to the other party prior to their entry into the contract.|$|E

[...] "Scalia’s opinion in Buckeye is an astonishing attempt to ..... an explicit federal policy imposing arbitration and rejecting judicial resolution of many legal issues." [...] He, too, notes the fundamental contradiction posed by allowing defenses to contract formation to remain adjudicable by courts. Before and after the decision, most state court cases he looked at challenging contracts on those defenses have been very receptive to arguments, particular <b>unconscionability.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A {{representation}} {{can be made}} by statement or conduct. [...] Although {{the representation}} must be clear and unambiguous, a representation can be inferred from silence where there is a duty to speak or from negligence where a duty of care arises. [...] Under English law, estoppel by representation of fact is not a cause of action, though it may be a defence or acts in support of a cause of action. There is some debate whether under English law courts will take into account <b>unconscionability</b> under estoppel by representation of fact, although Australian courts clearly do.|$|E
2500|$|The Concepcion {{decision}} also impacted {{the usage}} of arbitration clauses in consumer contracts, including {{the usage of}} [...] "consumer-friendly" [...] arbitration terms like the ones in AT's agreement. [...] Jean Sternlight said that the Concepcion decision would cause businesses to include arbitration clauses with class action waivers, saying that the Concepcion decision removed the possibility of [...] "costly litigation" [...] over whether such terms are enforceable. [...] In a 2012 research paper, Gilles wrote that the majority opinion in Concepcion led to a [...] "race to the top" [...] in implementing arbitration procedures that are more friendly to consumer claims {{and more likely to}} allow their vindication. [...] Gilles wrote that corporate lawyers encouraged companies to implement terms similar to the ones used by AT Mobility and upheld in Concepcion. [...] According to Gilles, many large consumer-oriented businesses changed their arbitration provisions in 2011 and 2012. [...] However, Gilles noted that only 6 out of the 37 companies she examined had arbitration clauses that [...] "offered anything close to AT's set of incentives, and none were quite as generous". [...] Ann Marie Tracey and Shelley McGill wrote that businesses would introduce more consumer-unfriendly terms in their arbitration clauses since <b>unconscionability</b> [...] "provided strong motivation for business to draft agreements fairly in the pre-Concepcion environment; that motivation does not exist in the post-Concepcion era." [...] Suzanna Sherry said that the broad holding of the decision would make harsh arbitration clauses, similar to the earliest consumer arbitration clauses, enforceable, since the <b>unconscionability</b> doctrine that had been used to strike down those harsh clauses could be found preempted based on Concepcion.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} opinion {{was written by}} Justice Antonin Scalia, and joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito. [...] "Requiring the availability of classwide arbitration interferes with fundamental attributes of arbitration," [...] Scalia wrote. [...] "We {{find it hard to}} believe that defendants would bet the company with no effective means of review, and even harder to believe that Congress would have intended to allow state courts to force such a decision." [...] Justice Scalia focused on the impact California's <b>unconscionability</b> law was having on arbitration clauses - since the rule was invalidating a large proportion of arbitration agreements, the rule must violate the policy in favor of arbitration. [...] Therefore, it was preempted by the FAA.|$|E
2500|$|The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) of 1925 {{established}} {{a public policy}} in favor of arbitration. For the first six decades of its existence, courts did not allow arbitration for [...] "federal statutory claims" [...] through a bright-line [...] "nonarbitrability" [...] doctrine, but in the 1980s the Supreme Court of the United States reversed and began to use the act to require arbitration if included in the contract for federal statutory claims. Although some legal scholars {{believe that it was}} originally intended to apply to federal courts only, courts now routinely require arbitration due to the FAA regardless of state statutes or public policy <b>unconscionability</b> determinations by state courts. In consumer law, standard form contracts often include mandatory predispute arbitration clauses which require consumer arbitration. Under these agreements the consumer may waive their right to a lawsuit and a class action. In 2011, one of these clauses was upheld in AT Mobility v. Concepcion.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Unconscionability</b> is {{a defense}} to the {{enforcement}} of a contract. Most jurisdictions in the United States determine <b>unconscionability</b> based on two prongs: procedural <b>unconscionability</b> and substantive <b>unconscionability.</b> Procedural <b>unconscionability</b> arises from [...] "contract formation" [...] issues such as inconspicuous terms or terms offered on a [...] "take-it-or-leave-it basis", while substantive <b>unconscionability</b> arises from [...] "overly-harsh" [...] or [...] "one-sided" [...] terms.|$|E

5000|$|In 1998, Richard E. Speidel {{discussed}} the possibility the <b>unconscionability</b> {{could be a}} defense to the enforcement of a consumer arbitration agreement, but he concluded that such a defense {{would be unlikely to}} succeed (even in a standard form contract) when the arbitration clause is not hidden or there are competitors that offer similar products or services without requiring arbitration. Alan Kaplinsky and Mark Levin wrote in a May 1999 article that [...] "relatively few consumer arbitration provisions have actually been struck down by courts as 'unfair' or 'unconscionable'". Charles L. Knapp, in a 2009 article, noted that Speidel only cited one case where an arbitration clause was unconscionable, and, in that case, it was based on what the Court described as [...] "unique facts". Aaron-Andrew P. Bruhl wrote that courts are not allowed to refuse to enforce an arbitration clause {{because of the nature of}} arbitration, but courts have considered whether specific arbitration terms are unconscionable. Knapp wrote that since Speidel's 1998 paper, more cases have arisen where a party successfully asserted <b>unconscionability</b> as a defense to the enforcement of an arbitration agreement. According to Bruhl, <b>unconscionability</b> was an issue in about 15 to 20 percent of cases in the mid 2000s, up from 1 percent a decade earlier. Bruhl posited that the rise in <b>unconscionability</b> defenses may have arisen from the Supreme Court's arbitration jurisprudence striking down other defenses to the enforcement of arbitration agreements. Bruhl wrote that some <b>unconscionability</b> challenges to arbitration terms (such as punitive damages limitations) do not fit in the mold of classical <b>unconscionability</b> cases. According to Bruhl, scholars have seen the <b>unconscionability</b> doctrine as a check against the Supreme Court's pro-arbitration jurisprudence. Bruhl suggested that courts opposing arbitration turned to fact-specific <b>unconscionability</b> inquiries as opposed to categorical rules to make their decisions more likely to stand after appeal. Overall, Bruhl concluded that [...] "unconscionability might operate as a sort of safety valve that makes arbitration politically sustainable" [...] since courts can use <b>unconscionability</b> to strike egregiously unfair terms, while the threat that an arbitration provision may be found unconscionable can encourage businesses not to include unfair arbitration terms.|$|E

5000|$|To avoid {{a ruling}} of {{procedural}} <b>unconscionability,</b> some businesses began allowing consumers to reject ("opt out" [...] of) arbitration agreements {{at the time}} of entering into a contract without penalty. F. Paul Bland and Claire Prestel wrote that more consumers will fail to exercise an opt-out option (which may be inconspicuously placed in a contract and difficult to understand) than would affirmatively agree to arbitrate, citing consumer optimism that disputes will not arise and transaction costs. They added that having an opt-out option would only affect procedural <b>unconscionability</b> and would not apply to other defenses, nor would it prevent a ruling of <b>unconscionability</b> in jurisdictions where substantive <b>unconscionability</b> alone can make a contract term unenforceable. Deepak Gupta, who argued on behalf of the consumer respondents in Concepcion, said that those opt-out provisions are illusory since consumers would not likely opt out before a dispute arises. Plaintiffs and lawyers attributed the lack of opt-outs to consumers not being aware of the existence of the arbitration clause or not understanding the ramifications of not opting out. [...] Charles Gibbs wrote that consumers who opt out would only be able to join in a class action with other consumers who also opted out, and therefore such a class action would have less of a deterrent effect against the business.|$|E
