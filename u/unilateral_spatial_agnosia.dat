40|$|A test of {{auditory}} language comprehension {{was given}} to 110 right brain-damaged patients and to 94 normal controls in order to check if patients with lesions of the right (nondominant) hemisphere make a significantly higher number of semantic errors than normals. Confirmation of the hypothesis was obtained, but the relationship between semantic errors and lesion of the right hemisphere did not seem a simple and direct one. In fact, most of the lexical-semantic errors were due to associated variables (such as <b>unilateral</b> <b>spatial</b> <b>agnosia</b> and general mental deterioration) {{and not to the}} lesion of the right hemisphere per se.

The Spanish {{version of the}} Behavioral Inattention Test shows {{a high degree of}} reliability both in the complete test (α =. 90) and in the conventional (α =. 93) and behavioral subtests (α =. 75). The concurrent validity between the total conventional and behavioral scores was high (r=-. 80; p< 0. 001). Significant differences were found between patients with and without <b>unilateral</b> <b>spatial</b> neglect (p< 0. 001).

40|$|Patients with <b>unilateral</b> <b>spatial</b> neglect are {{impaired}} in directing focal attention {{toward the}} contralesional side of space. Provision of static spatial cues on the neglected side {{has previously been}} shown to help overcome this deficit. Common movement of visual stimuli may also guide the allocation of spatial attention, although examined in patients with <b>unilateral</b> <b>spatial</b> neglect. Eleven patients with right hemisphere damage and clinical evidence of left: <b>unilateral</b> <b>spatial</b> neglect, and 11 matched, healthy controls were tested on a task of horizontal line bisection. Lines were presented on a computer display, with a neutral, static, or slowly drifting, random dot background. Under conditions of motion, background stimuli drifted either leftward or rightward, across the full width of the display, at speeds that did not elicit optokinetic nystagmus or perceptual aftereffects. Controls were accurate in all conditions, and showed minimal effects of background conditions. By contrast, patients with left <b>unilateral</b> <b>spatial</b> neglect were sensitive to leftward background motion, showing a significant leftward shift in bisection error, relative to neutral, static, and rightward moving backgrounds. There was no significant effect of rightward motion {{in comparison with the}} neutral and static conditions. The extent to which patients were susceptible to the effects of background motion was not related to severity of <b>unilateral</b> <b>spatial</b> neglect, as measured by clinical tests.

40|$|Three {{patients}} with left <b>unilateral</b> <b>spatial</b> neglect after predominantly frontal lobe lesions {{were asked to}} extend a horizontal line leftwards to double its original length. In this line extension task, they readily executed movements in or towards the contralesional left space. They performed the task in {{the left and right}} hemispaces {{as well as in the}} midline. The mean extension lengths did not differ significantly among these three spatial conditions. These results suggest that directional hypokinesia takes little part in left <b>unilateral</b> <b>spatial</b> neglect due to frontal lobe lesions. It is considered that the patients could execute leftward movements as the task oriented their attention sufficiently to the left. Two of the three patients, like reported cases with frontal neglect, showed a typical exploratory deficit for the left space in the line cancellation test. Such a deficit found in the traditional tasks, however, does not mean the presence of directional hypokinesia. All three patients showed visual extinction on double simultaneous stimulation.

40|$|The authors' {{previous}} study {{with an eye}} camera revealed that when asked to mark the centre of a line patients with left <b>unilateral</b> <b>spatial</b> neglect persist in fixating a point on its right part and place the subjective midpoint there without searching leftwards. The present study examined the patterns of leftward search of nine patients with left <b>unilateral</b> <b>spatial</b> neglect when {{they were required to}} search for the left endpoint of the line after the bisection. The patients could search leftwards beyond the subjective midpoint to place the mark at the subjective left endpoint. The initial fixation in this search always fell near the point located {{to the left of the}} subjective midpoint by the distance between the subjective midpoint and the right endpoint of the line. In patients with severe neglect the search further to the left of this point was laborious and fell short of the true left endpoint in about 80 % of the trials.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether visual evoked fields (VEFs) elicited by {{right and left}} hemifield stimulation differ in patients with <b>unilateral</b> <b>spatial</b> neglect that results from cerebrovascular accident. METHODS: Pattern-reversal stimulation of {{the right and left}} hemifield was performed in three patients with left <b>unilateral</b> <b>spatial</b> neglect. Magnetoencephalography was recorded using a 160 -channel system, and VEFs were quantified in the 400 ms after each stimulus. The presence or absence of VEF components at around 100 ms (P 100 m component) and 145 ms (N 145 m component) after stimulus onset was determined. The source of the VEF was determined using a single equivalent current dipole model for spherical volume conduction. All patients were evaluated using the behavioral inattention test (BIT). RESULTS: In response to right hemifield stimulation, the P 100 m and N 145 m components of the VEF were evident in all three patients. In response to left hemifield stimulation, both components were evident in Patient 3, whereas only the P 100 m component was evident in Patient 1 and only the N 145 m component was evident in Patient 2. Patient 1 exhibited impairments on the line bisection and cancellation tasks of the BIT, Patient 2 exhibited impairments on the copying, drawing and cancellation tasks of the BIT, and Patient 3 exhibited impairments on the cancellation task of the BIT. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that early VEFs are disrupted in patients with <b>unilateral</b> <b>spatial</b> neglect and support the concept that deficits in visual processing differ according to the clinical subtype of <b>unilateral</b> <b>spatial</b> neglect and the lesion location. This study also demonstrates the feasibility of using magnetoencephalography to explore subtypes of neglect...|$|R

Consequently, it is possible that since the sensorimotor experience in the affected space is perturbed, patients avoid this space, which results in neglect behavior.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{clarify the}} reason why {{patients}} with left <b>unilateral</b> <b>spatial</b> neglect fail to copy {{the left side of}} a daisy like flower, not continuing to draw petals all around.  METHODS—A flower was simplified and a figure was made that consisted of a large central circle and small circles surrounding it. Four patients with typical left <b>unilateral</b> <b>spatial</b> neglect performed copying and arrangement tasks to make this figure. In the arrangement task, they were instructed to arrange small circles all around the printed central circle.  RESULTS—The patients' identification of the composition seemed flawless. In the copying task, they showed neglect, leaving a space on the left side. They seemed to adhere to their plan to place the same number of small circles as those of the model figure. By contrast, neglect disappeared in the arrangement task.  CONCLUSION—Patients with neglect can draw the figure satisfactorily if they use a spatial strategy to arrange small circles all around. This strategy seems to improve motivation for drawing and awareness for the left space. It is considered that in the copying of figures such as a daisy, failure to use a spatial strategy plays an important part in the appearance of left <b>unilateral</b> <b>spatial</b> neglect. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} virtual reality training on <b>unilateral</b> <b>spatial</b> neglect in stroke patients.

All patients were randomly assigned to either the virtual reality (VR) group (n= 12) or the control group (n= 12). The VR group received VR training, which stimulated the left side of their bodies. The control group received conventional neglect therapy such as visual scanning training. Both groups received therapy for 30 minutes a day, five days per week for three weeks. Outcome measurements included star cancellation test, line bisection test, Catherine Bergego scale (CBS), and the Korean version of modified Barthel index (K-MBI). These measurements were taken before and after treatment. Results There {{were no significant differences in}} the baseline characteristics and initial values between the two groups. The changes in star cancellation test results and CBS in the VR group were significantly higher than those of the control group after treatment.

40|$|Contrasting {{results have}} been {{obtained}} in previous investigations, which have used the standard version of Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices for studying the effects of localized brain lesion on visual-spatial intelligence. Some of these discrepancies {{might be due to}} the fact that specific factors, such as <b>unilateral</b> <b>spatial</b> neglect, could contribute to decreased performance obtained on Raven's test by patients with focal brain lesions. A new set of Colored Matrices, devised to minimize the influence of <b>unilateral</b> <b>spatial</b> neglect without changing the essential features of the original task, was therefore constructed. The test was administered to 76 normal controls, 74 right brain-damaged patients, 87 aphasics, and 61 nonaphasic left brain-damaged patients, in order to study the effect of laterality of lesions and of language impairment on Raven's scores. The results show that, if the influence of <b>unilateral</b> <b>spatial</b> neglect is minimized and Raven's scores are corrected in reference to age, educational level, and lesion size, then: no significant differences are observed between right and left brain-damaged patients; aphasics score worse than nonaphasic left brain-damaged patients; impairment is greater in patients with Wernicke's and Global aphasia (i. e., in patients with severe language comprehension disorders) than in patients classified as Broca's, Anomic, or Conduction aphasia; impairment is greater in patients with semantic-lexical discrimination errors than in patients free from semantic-lexical comprehension disorders...|$|R

40|$|SYNOPSIS Patients with {{unilateral}} brain lesions {{were given}} a task requiring exploration of space with the hand {{in order to assess}} the visual dependency of <b>unilateral</b> <b>spatial</b> neglect. The task was carried out both without visual control and under visual control. Performances were compared with that ofnormal subjects.

The performance of the patients with right brain damage without visual field defect is not clearly understood. The other results suggest that inner spatial representation remains intact in most cases of spatial neglect. The role of parietal lobe damage in the development of this visually induced phenomenon is hypothesised. The dominant position of vision among the senses is indicated.

40|$|Detailed {{analyses}} {{of reading and}} nonlexical tasks by three patients with <b>unilateral</b> <b>spatial</b> neglect (USN) secondary to stroke indicate that the USN {{in each of these}} patients affects the left side (contralateral to brain damage) of the viewer, with respect to the viewer’s head, mid-sagittal plane of the body, or line of sight. In one case, the neglect was further specified as concerning {{the left side of the}} viewer’s line of sight (the left half of her residual visual field). Thus, the frame of reference of USN in these three cases appears to have viewer-centered (in at least one case, specifically retinotopic) coordinates. The performance of these patients is contrasted to that of other patients in the literature whose USN appears to have a frame of reference with stimulus-centered or object-centered coordinates.

Typically the patient's deficit is supramodal: patients with hemineglect fail to respond to novel or meaningful stimuli irrespective of whether they are presented in the visual, auditory, and somesthetic (somatosensory) domain. As adequate perception and spatial representation of both the body and the outside world are mandatory for almost all activities of daily living, hemineglect is known to limit the degree of active participation in rehabilitation programs and is thus commonly associated with poor functional recovery and less successful social reintegration.

METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out over a 10 -year period in a pediatric rehabilitation department specializing in acquired brain lesions. Twelve cases were selected involving children aged 7 months to 14 years. Neglect was assessed by behavior observation for all children and, depending on age, by drawing, copying, reading, writing, and arithmetic tasks.

Right hemisphere lesions often lead to severe disorders in spatial awareness and behavior, such as left hemispatial neglect. Neglect involves not only pathological biases in attention and exploration but also deficits in internal representations of space and spatial working memory. Here we designed a new paradigm to test whether one potential component may involve a failure to maintain an updated representation of visual locations across delays when a gaze-shift intervenes. Right hemisphere patients with varying severity of left spatial neglect had to encode a single target location and retain it across an interval of 2 or 3 sec, during which the target was transiently removed, before a subsequent probe appeared for a same/different location judgment. During the delay, gaze could have to shift {{to either side of}} the remembered location, or no gaze-shift was required.

Attention facilitating effects in neglect patients have been reported separately both for audiovisual and for looming stimulation. The current study attempts to improve the orientation of attention to the neglected (left) hemi-space using a multisensory synchronous combination of audiovisual and looming stimulation. <b>Unilateral</b> <b>spatial</b> neglect can be described as a problem with the disengagement from the right hemi-space and a reduced attention for the left, leading to a loss of perceptual awareness for the left side of the surroundings. Because of this primarily quantitative – behavioural - difference between patients and healthy people a simulation of the effects with an experimental technique in healthy participants could be valuable. In our study the awareness of the left side of the visual field was inhibited in healthy participants using continuous flash suppression, a potent form of binocular rivalry wherein a visual stimulus presented to one eye is suppressed from awareness as a result of a rapidly changing sequence of high-contrast, contour-rich patterns viewed by the other eye.
