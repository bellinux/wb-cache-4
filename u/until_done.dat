50|$|In the Philippines, Banana cue is {{a popular}} snack. The {{portmanteau}} 'Banana cue' may be a misnomer as {{it is not really}} cooked in a skewer over hot embers like a barbecue. Rather, the peeled flesh of an under ripe plantain is fried in hot oil over medium fire before it is held in a skewer ready for sale. There are two ways to prepare a banana cue. One way is to fry the peeled banana in oil with some amount of brown sugar thrown in to caramelize the flesh. Another way is to fry the flesh in oil <b>until</b> <b>done.</b> When done, they are scooped out of the cooking pan and placed on a dripping pan to allow the oil to drip, before a generous amount of refined sugar is sprinkled over them. A variant from Mindanao, known as Ginanggang, is different in that it is actually grilled over charcoal.|$|E

Modern {{supermarkets}} who sell beef tripe offer {{a version of}} this meat which has been previously processed by scalding it in very hot water, which significantly reduces cooking time by several hours.

The water is removed and discarded, then the tripe is then placed back into the pot and fresh water, oregano, red chili paste or powder, lime/lemon juice, and salt are added and boiled over low heat for another hour until the tripe is tender, after which hominy is added then allowed to cook an additional half hour <b>until</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E
