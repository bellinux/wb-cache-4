25|$|A {{system with}} an {{intermediate}} quality factor (Qnbsp&=nbsp&) {{is said to}} be critically damped. Like an overdamped system, the output does not oscillate, and does not overshoot its steady-state output (i.e., it approaches a steady-state asymptote). Like an underdamped response, the output of such a system responds quickly to a <b>unit</b> <b>step</b> input. Critical damping results in the fastest response (approach to the final value) possible without overshoot. Real system specifications usually allow some overshoot for a faster initial response or require a slower initial response to provide a safety margin against overshoot.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For any finite path v on {{the square}} grid {{consisting}} of north and east <b>unit</b> <b>steps,</b> starting at (0, 0), we construct a poset Tam(v) that consists of all the paths weakly above v with {{the same number of}} north and east steps as v. For particular choices of v, we recover the traditional Tamari lattice and the m-Tamari lattice. Let←−v be the path obtained from v by reading the <b>unit</b> <b>steps</b> of v in reverse order, replacing the east steps by north steps and vice versa. We show that the poset Tam(v) is isomorphic to the dual of the poset Tam(←−v). We do so by showing bijectively that the poset Tam(v) is isomorphic to the poset based on rotation of full binary trees with the fixed canopy v, from which the duality follows easily. This also shows that Tam(v) is a lattice for any path v. We also obtain as a corollary of this bijection that the usual Tamari lattice, based on Dyck paths of height n, is a partition of the (smaller) lattices Tam(v), where the v are all the paths {{on the square}} grid that consist of n − 1 <b>unit</b> <b>steps.</b> We explain possible connections between the poset Tam(v) and (the combinatorics of) the generalized diagonal coinvariant spaces of the symmetric group. 1...|$|R
