50|$|S. s. stuarti, a {{very dark}} variant of the {{northern}} rough-winged swallow, was described by Pierce Brodkorb in 1942. It is resident to the southern Mexico lowlands and south to eastern Guatemala. Like the race fulvipennis, it has a slightly buff throat. The <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> also have black tips.|$|R
50|$|S. s. ridgwayi, {{described}} by Edward Nelson in 1901, is a subspecies resident {{to the northern}} Yucatán Peninsula. It {{is larger than the}} nominate race with a whitish spot above its lores and has blackish tips on the longest of its <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts.</b> In addition, it is darker above and has paler anterior underparts.|$|R
50|$|The mature bird has the head, neck, flanks, and rump blue grey, and {{the wings}} cinnamon, mottled with black. The breast is vinaceous, the abdomen and <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> are white. The bill is black, {{the legs and}} eye rims are red. The black and white patch {{on the side of}} the neck is absent in the browner and duller {{juvenile}} bird, which also has the legs brown.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} plumage morphs exists, {{with the primary}} {{distinction}} being between the pale morph and the dark morph. Both morphs usually have dark brown upper parts and wing coverts. Dark morph birds have predominantly dark under parts, although some light streaking is common. Pale morph birds have white under parts that are varyingly streaked with brown, sometimes heavily so. Pale individuals may also have prominently white <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> and these may be diagnostic.|$|R
50|$|S. s. fulvipennis is a {{resident}} of central Mexico to Costa Rica. It was the first subspecies to be differentiated from the nominate race, serripennis, and was differentiated by Philip Sclater in 1860. It is darker above; the crown darker more so. The shafts of the <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts,</b> the feathers <b>under</b> the <b>tail,</b> covering the base, have been observed to be darker near the end. The throat of these swallows seem to be slightly buff, unlike {{most of the other}} subspecies.|$|R
50|$|The Asian fairy bluebird {{measures}} 24 to 27 cm in length. The iris is crimson and eyelids pinkish; the bill, {{legs and}} claws are black, and mouth a flesh- colour. Marked sexual dimorphism is evident. The male is a shining ultramarine-blue with lilac reflections on its upper plumage, lesser wing <b>coverts,</b> and <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts,</b> while {{the sides of}} its head and the whole lower plumage are deep black; greater wing-coverts, quills, and tail black, {{and some of the}} coverts tipped with blue, and the middle tail-feathers glossed with blue.|$|R
50|$|It {{is a small}} secretive crake with a short {{bill with}} black and olive brown streaks on the back. Its tail is black, its underparts are slate, except throat is pale grey. and lower flanks and <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> are barred black and white. Sexes are alike.The nest is a large open bowl made out of dry grass, {{on the ground or}} just above. Well hidden between tree roots or grass. Clutch size is 2-5 eggs. No further data available.Diet {{consists}} of insects and insect larvae and grass seeds. Only appears in the open to feed.|$|R
50|$|Adults are 13 - 15 cm in length, brown above {{with white}} underparts, a small bill, and a forked tail. Their throat {{is a white}} with a brownish-grey wash, and below the throat are its white underparts. The adults have a {{wingspan}} of 27 - 30 cm and a weight of 10 - 18 g. The males' <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> are longer and broader {{than that of the}} females. The males also have hooked barbs on the outer web of their outer primary wings. The barbs on the females are shorter and straighter than that of the males. Juveniles can be distinguished from adults by their reddish-brown wing-bars.|$|R
50|$|The Cooper's hawks are monogamous, {{but most}} do not mate for life. Pairs will breed {{once a year}} and raise one brood per {{breeding}} season. Courtship displays include stylized flights with the wings positioned in a deep arc. During their flight displays the male will begin by diving toward the female. A slow speed-chase follows involving the male flying around the female exposing his expanded <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> to her. The male raises his wings high above the back and flies in a wide arc with slow, rhythmic flapping. Courting usually occurs on bright, sunny days, in midmorning. After pairing has occurred, the males make a bowing display before beginning to build the nest.|$|R
50|$|The {{adult male}} has a black crown with a buff margin, and {{sometimes}} a buff central streak. The front and {{side of the head}} are buff, the individual feathers having black tips. The throat is pale buff, darkening to reddish-buff at the edges and on the breast, and paling again on the belly, becoming white at the <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts.</b> The sides of the breast are scattered with round black spots. The nape and upper parts of the body and tail are greyish-brown, with reddish and dark brown vermiculations and spotting. The main wing feathers are blackish-brown with buff margins, and the wing coverts are buff with dark spots. The beak is dull yellow, the irises whitish, and the legs and feet deep yellow.|$|R
50|$|These {{birds that}} can be found at Weed Lake have black heads and black under parts. They have a grey back, tail and wings, and white <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts.</b> They have a black bill and reddish- black legs. The black tern is {{approximately}} 23-25 cm long and 58-62 cm wide. Terns can live for 34 years or longer! Did you know? - they eat little fish from the lakes and ponds, as well as insects from the air, tall grass and the waters surface. They live in shallow, fresh water, cattail marshes, sloughs and lake edges that are grassy. Black terns communicate to each other with a “shrill” sound, “kik- kik-kik-kik and “kreea” sound. They leave Weed Lake in September to head to tropical coasts.|$|R
50|$|Adult {{length is}} between 21 and 22 cm. The upper parts are black heavily barred with white, with the mantle being unbarred. The upper tail is black with some white {{markings}} {{on the outer}} feathers. The crown and nape are red in the male and black in the female. The face is whitish with a black moustache which unites with a stripe {{on the edge of}} the breast. The throat, breast and belly are greyish-yellow or greyish-buff, boldly streaked with black. The <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> are red. The iris is chestnut and the beak is grey, long and sharply pointed. The legs and feet are bluish-grey. The juvenile has greyer underparts, the under-tail coverts are pink or orange, and the crown is a duller red in young males.|$|R
50|$|Ranging from 18-20 cm {{in length}} with a {{wingspan}} of 32-34 cm, weighing approximately 37 grams, the Masked Woodswallow {{is similar in}} size to the White-browed Woodswallow. Sexes differ markedly in colour and also in immature plumage. This difference between sexes is unique only to the Masked Woodswallow and White-browed Woodswallow. Adult males have a sharply defined black face mask with a pale edge. This mask covers the lores, ear coverts, chin and throat. Upperparts, dark blue grey with a prominent white tip on the tail. Underbody is pale grey, fading to greyish white on <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts.</b> Legs and feet are grey to grey black or black. Adult female is similar to adult male but is slightly browner then male and mask is indistinct. Juveniles are similar to adult females but slightly browner with fletched and mottled buff.|$|R
5000|$|The {{woodpecker}} is 23 cm long, and is {{very similar}} to the great spotted woodpecker, Dendrocopos major. The upper parts of the male are glossy black, with a crimson spot on the nape and white on the forehead, sides of the face and neck. On the shoulder is a large white patch and the flight feathers are black with white spots forming three wingbars. The three outer tail feathers show only a few white spots; these show when the short stiff tail is outspread, acting as a support in climbing. The under parts are buffish white, the abdomen and <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> reddish. The long bill is slate black and the legs greenish grey. [...] The female has no crimson on the nape, and in the young this nape spot is absent, but the crown is crimson.|$|R
50|$|Measuring 18 to 19 cm, the black-throated robin has a grey-black face, {{throat and}} upper breast with a grey crown and nape, {{and a white}} {{diagonal}} mark on the neck. The upperparts are blue-grey, and the underparts grey to white over the abdomen and <b>under</b> the <b>tail</b> <b>coverts.</b> The bill and legs are black, and the eyes are dark brown. The plumage is reminiscent of a cuckoo-shrike but the white neck marking is diagnostic.|$|R
50|$|When feeding {{they walk}} slowly up hill, {{picking up the}} tender blades of grass and young shoots of plants on the way. They have been noted feeding on the berries of Ephedra, leaves of Artemisia, grass shoots, bulbs and the heads of a rye-like grass. In the Hunza range, they have been {{observed}} to prefer Sibbaldia cuneata. Once they reach {{the top of a}} ridge of the hill, they fly off to adjacent hill, alighting some distance down, and again picking their way upwards. When walking, they cock their tails showing the white <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts.</b> They are generally wary and when disturbed run uphill and then launch themselves from the crests in flight, getting up considerable speed. They are more prone to predation on the alpine pastures than on steep slopes and flocking helps them to keep more eyes out for predators allowing them to forage more efficiently. In the Hunza range, flock sizes tended to be larger in rocky habitats, where they risked being attacked by Golden Eagles, than on grassy meadows.|$|R
40|$|On 6 August 1989, we {{observed}} a Sage Sparrow approximately one mile east of Coffee Park in Sow Belly Canyon in Sioux Co. The Sparrow flew {{from an area}} of sagebrush along the road and perched {{in the top of}} some brush about three to four meters high. The bird appeared to be an adult. Its bill was bluish-gray, breast was white with brownish streaks and a central dark spot. It had two faint pale wingbars, whitish eye-ring, a white stripe above the eye, whitish whisker stripe, grayish brown face patch, and light brown streaks on its sides. The head and nape were grayish, the back and wings were brownish, tail was slightly notched, and the crown was streaked with brownish marks. The <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> appeared to have streaks. It was {{about the size of a}} Vesper Sparrow. We observed the Sparrow for about 10 minutes, from a distance of about 15 meters. The bird did not call or sing during the observation period. The sky was sunny and viewing conditions were excellent. It was viewed using 7 x 35 binoculars and a 15 - 60 power, 60 mm zoom telescope. A photograph of the bird was not obtained. A description of this encounter has been submitted to the Records Committee...|$|R
50|$|Zosterops were numerous, and {{appeared}} to breed on the islands, judging by a few old nests. As at some of our more southern camps, it was delightful {{to listen to the}} subdued chorus of the birds’ sweet warbling songs at daybreak. Regularly on Masthead they commenced to warble from 10 to 5 minutes before 5 o’clock.White-eyes were observed in great numbers on North-West and Tryon Islands, where, also, the nesting season had not yet commenced. Several skins were procured - the first by Mr J.W. Mellor.From a critical examination of these skins it is at once noticeable that they are not referable to Z. caerulescens, but are more in agreement with the description of Quoy and Gaimard’s Z. westernensis. Should further research prove them different, we venture to suggest the name Z. chlorocephalus, or Green-headed White-eye (on account of the “clean-cut” markings of that colour), the following being the general description: - Male. - Distinct ring of silvery-white round the eye, succeeded by a black line under the eye; head, mantle, upper wing <b>coverts,</b> and upper <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> bright olive-green; back grey, blending into the greenish mantle; wings and tail dark brown, the primaries and tail feathers edged with bright olive-green; chin, throat, and <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> greenish-yellow; rest of the under surface grayish-blue, darkest on the chest, and approaching grayish-white on the abdomen. Bill dark brown, the basal half of the lower mandible lighter coloured; tarsus dark grey. Dimensions in inches: - Length, 4 ¾ mm; wing, 2 11/16 mm; bill, 7/16 mm; tail, 2 mm; tarsus, 11/16 mm.|$|R
2500|$|Adult {{male and}} female rufous-tailed scrub robin look alike and measure about [...] long with {{relatively}} long legs and a large rounded tail. The upper parts are a rich brownish chestnut, with the rump and upper tail-coverts rather more rufous. There is a distinct curved, creamy-white broad streak from the nostrils to behind the eye and a dark brown line through the eye. The under-eye area is whitish and the ear coverts pale brown. The eye and the beak are both brown but the lower mandible of the beak has a greyish base. The underparts are buffish white, with the chin, central belly and <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> paler than the other parts. The feathers of the wing are dark brown, fringed {{on the leading edge}} with buff and on the trailing edge with pale chestnut-brown and with the secondaries tipped with white. The central pair of feathers on the tail are bright rufous-chestnut with narrow black tips and the rest a similar colour with white tips and adjacent broad black bands. The legs and feet are pale brown. Juveniles are similar in appearance but generally a paler sandy-brown colour. The plumage is moulted in the autumn and prior to this, the white tips of the tail feathers may have become reduced in size or worn off.|$|R
5000|$|The woolly-necked stork is a {{medium-sized}} stork at 75-92 cm tall. The iris is deep crimson or wine-red. The stork is glistening black overall {{with a black}} [...] "skull cap", a downy white neck which gives it its name. The lower belly and under-tail coverts are white, standing out {{from the rest of}} the dark coloured plumage. Feathers on the fore-neck are iridescent with a coppery-purple tinge. These feathers are elongated and can be erected during displays. The tail is deeply forked and is white, usually covered by the black long <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts.</b> It has long red legs and a heavy, blackish bill, though some specimens have largely dark-red bills with only the basal one-third being black. Sexes are alike. Juvenile birds are duller versions of the adult with a feathered forehead that is sometimes streaked black-and-white. The African birds are described as having the edges of the black cap diffused or with a jagged border compared to a sharp and clean border in the Asian birds. Sexes are identical, though males are thought to be larger. When the wings are opened either during displays or for flight, a narrow band of very bright unfeathered skin is visible along the underside of the forearm. This band has been variously described as being [...] "neon, orange-red", [...] "like a red-gold jewel", and [...] "almost glowing" [...] when seen at close range.|$|R
40|$|On 13 May 1988 Dr. J. J. Baumel {{discovered}} a male Williamson 2 ̆ 7 s Sapsucker (Sphyrapicus thyroideus) lying dead below an elevated, glassed-in walkway between buildings on Creighton University 2 ̆ 7 s campus in downtown Omaha, Nebraska. The bird, beautiful in breeding plumage, was largely black from its awl-shaped bill to its stiff, acuminate central tail feathers. There {{was a white}} line beginning {{at the base of}} the lower mandible and extending over the face, while another ran back from the eye. The white wing coverts formed a broad white line on the wing. Also, there were white tips on the tertials, while small white dots on five feathers- formed four rows on the closed primaries. The rump and upper <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> were white. There was a narrow, bright red patch on the chin. While the upper breast was black, the lower breast and belly were yellow. The flanks and <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> were mottled white and black. The bird weighed 51 grams. Its total length was 225 millimeters, its wingspread 413 millimeters, and its wingchord 135 millimeters. Its left testis was 4 x 6 millimeters, while the right was 4 x 4 millimeters. This western species breeds in dry conifer forests of the Rockies and west. There have been only four previous sightings reported for the states. The two with adequate descriptions were also of males seen during spring migration, one 24 March 1939 at Hastings and one 5 May 1959 near Grand Island (T. E. Bray, B. K. Padelford, and W. R. Silcock, 1985. The Birds of Nebraska). Any sighting of Williamson 2 ̆ 7 s Sapsucker in Nebraska would be a treat, but the Omaha discovery is especially far east. This specimen, now at the state museum at University of Nebraska at Omaha, is the first collected in Nebraska...|$|R
40|$|From the Aroe Islands, four {{different}} species of White-eyes were recorded with more or less certainty in literature (Salvadori, 1881; Finsch, 1901; Stresemann, 1931). Mayr (1941), the latest revisor, lists three species, viz., Zosterops novaeguineae subsp., Z. minor sharpei, and Z. chloris chloris (now named Z. lutca chloris, cf. Mayr, 1944). The presence in the Leiden Museum of a small series (6 specimens) of Z. novaeguineae from the Aroe Islands, and of the type specimen of Z. sharpei, enables me to discuss these forms more fully than hitherto has been possible. Zosterops novaeguineae Salvadori As at Leiden no material for comparison was available, I sent 5 specimens from the Aroe Islands to the American Museum of Natural History, New York, where Dr. Mayr and Dr. Amadon compared them with series of Z. n. novaeguineae (7 adults) and Z. n. wuroi (4 adults and several immatures). I am very much indebted to Dr. Mayr and Dr. Amadon for their notes which enabled me to describe the Aroe specimens as a new race. Here follow the distinctive characters of the three races: Zosterops novaeguineae novaeguineae Salvadori, 1878. Eye-ring comparatively narrow; upper parts yellowish green; breast and flanks rather pale grey; throat and <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> yellow. Wing: ♂ 59 (Salvadori's type specimen); ♂ 57 (Leiden Museum); ♂♂ 55, 56, 56, 58; ♀♀ 54, 56; sex ? 55 mm (American Museum). All specimens are from the Arfak Mountains, Vogelkop, Dutch New Guinea. Zosterops novaeguineae wuroi Mayr & Rand, 1935. Eye-ring broad; upper parts much greener than in the nominate race (the original publicatio...|$|R
5000|$|B. b. hemachalana (Hume, 1873) - The Himalayan eagle-owl. The {{range of}} B. b. hemachalana {{extends from the}} Himalayas and Tibet, westward to the Tian Shan system in Russian Turkestan, west to the Kara Tau, north to the Dzungarian Alatau, east to at least the Tekkes Valley in Xinjiang, and south to the regions of Kashgar, Yarkant and {{probably}} the western Kunlun Mountains. This bird is partly migratory, descending to the plains of Turkmenistan with colder winter weather, and apparently reaches northern Balochistan. This is a medium-sized subspecies, though is larger than other potentially abutting arid Asian eagle-owl races which share a somewhat similar yellowish ground colour. The male attains a wing chord length of 420 - 485 mm, while the female’s wing chord is 450 - 505 mm. The bill measures 42 - 45 mm in length. 11 adult eagle-owls of this race from the Tibetan Plateau averaged 301 mm in tail length, 78 mm in tarsus length and scaled an average of 2.16 kg in mass. This race is physically similar to B. b. turcomanus but the background colour is more light yellowish-brown and less buff. The dark patterns on upper- and under-parts are some more expressed and less regular than in B. b. turcomanus and B. b. omissus and the general colour from the mantle to the ear tufts is a more consistent brownish colour than most other abutting races. B. b. hemachalana differs from B. b. yenisseensis by being much more yellow on the rump, <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts,</b> and outer <b>tail</b> feathers, rather than grayish or whitish, and the ground coloration of its body is more yellowish above, and is less whitish below.

40|$|The red bishop bird, Euplectes orix, is a {{widespread}} and locally abundant member of the weaver family, the Ploceidae. It is found over most of Southern Africa, and as, far north as Uganda in the Eastern savannah belt. Large flocks {{may be found in}} association with other seedeaters, and the breeding colonies in reeds or tall grass in marshy areas may contain from five to several thousand birds. Recently it has also been recorded as nesting in standing crops in some areas. The adult birds are sparrow-sized, 12 - 15 cm in length and weighing 20 - 30 gm. The wing-length in the males ranges from 70 - 83 mm, and in females from 64 - 72 mm. Mackworth- Praed and Grant (1962) mention that birds from the Cape are larger, and that {{there appears to be a}} decrease in size of birds further north; measurements taken in this study seem to confirm this. During most of the year, both sexes are a mottled light brown colour, with a pale streak above the eye, and the underside pale to almost white, with darker streaks. However, at the beginning of the breeding season the adult males moult into their striking nuptial plumage: the abdomen and face mask are black, while the crown, throat, breast, rump, upper and <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> are scarlet. The mantle feathers are tawny, but the wings and tail remain brown. The bill colour also changes from flesh-coloured to black. Hall and Moreau (1970), whose nomenclature is used for all the passerine species mentioned, regard three species Euplectes orix, franciscus and nigroventris as comprising the "orix superspecies". All three retain the brown wings and tail in the male breeding dress, but show variations in the extent of the red and black plumage. There is no apparent overlap in their ranges, or any evidence of inter-breeding. Two further species, E. hordeceu and E. gierowii, differ in that the wings and tail of the male are also black during the breeding season. Although slightly larger, their plumage is in other respects very similar, and these five species are termed a "species group". There is surprisingly little published information on any of these species. Lack (1935) first described territorial behaviour and polygyny in Euplectes hordeaceus, and later Moreau and Moreau (1938) and Fuggles-Couchman (1942) compared the ecology of E. hordeaceus and E. nigroventris. Skead (1956) produced a valuable basic study of E. orix, and showed it to be polygynous. Emlen (1957) made observations on several Euplectes species in Rhodesia, but the species orix and hordeaceus are confused in his paper, and it is not always clear which he is referring to. Later studies dealing with E. orix by Brooke (1964), Schmidt (1968) and Woodall (1971) are primarily concerned with clutch size, breeding seasons and nesting success, rather than behaviour. However, Crook (1962, 1963, 1964) has produced an important series of papers comprising a comparative study of behaviour in the entire weaver family. He refers mostly to the genus Euplectes, but also quotes observations on individual species, including E. orix. Collias and Collias (1964) have described nest-building behaviour in the weavers, but also mainly at the generic level...|$|R
