50|$|Conventional {{explicit}} certificates {{are made}} up of three parts: identification data, a public key and a digital signature which binds the public key to the <b>user’s</b> <b>identification</b> data (ID). The digital certificate is created by a trusted third party and its signature can be independently verified by anyone in the network. The public key, ID and digital signature are distinct data elements which make up the physical size of the certificate. Conventional certificates can get very large. For example, a standard X.509 certificate is on the order of 1KB in size (~8000 bits).|$|R

We presume {{that some of}} these users belong to a small community ofusers who have unusual preferences, such users are not compliant with the CFunderlying assumption. They are grey sheep users. This paper aims at accurately identifying grey sheep users. We introduce a new distribution-based grey sheep users identificationtechnique, that borrows from outlier detection and from informationretrieval, while taking into account the specificities of preferencedata on which CF relies: extreme sparsity, imprecision and users' bias.
