5|$|Although {{the regular}} Confederate {{military}} had a paper strength of 6,000 personnel, the first 100,000 volunteers {{from all over}} the South participated in a variety of dress. Many were from state militia outfits, which had their own state-issued uniforms. In the early battles, some Confederate <b>units</b> <b>that</b> wore dark blue uniforms were often mistaken on the field of battle for the enemy. Conversely, many Union <b>units</b> <b>that</b> were originally militia units went to war wearing gray.|$|E
5|$|In the British and Commonwealth {{system of}} battle honours, {{there was no}} {{distinct}} award for service in Operation Varsity.

5|$|Although cavalry {{was used}} {{extensively}} {{throughout the world}} during the 19th century, horses became less important to warfare after {{the beginning of the}} 20th century.

5|$|Auxiliary uniform, armour, {{weapons and}} {{equipment}} were probably standardised {{by the end}} of the Julio-Claudian period. Auxiliary equipment was broadly similar to that of the legions (see Section 2.1 below for possible differences in armour). By 68AD, there was little difference between most auxiliary infantry and their legionary counterparts in equipment, training and fighting capability. The main difference was that auxilia contained combat cavalry, both heavy and light, and other specialized <b>units</b> <b>that</b> legions lacked.|$|E

5|$|During its evolution, {{the metric}} system has adopted many units of measure. The {{introduction}} of SI rationalised both {{the way in}} which units of measure were defined and also the list of units in use. These are now catalogued in the official SI Brochure.

5|$|From its beginning, {{the main}} {{features}} of the metric system were the standard set of interrelated base units and a standard set of prefixes in powers of ten. These base units are used to derive larger and smaller <b>units</b> <b>that</b> could replace {{a huge number of}} other units of measure in existence. Although the system was first developed for commercial use, the development of coherent units of measure made it particularly suitable for science and engineering.|$|E
5|$|Governments {{sometimes}} operate <b>units</b> <b>that</b> {{specialize in}} {{measurement of the}} Earth's magnetic field.

Such observatories can measure and forecast magnetic conditions such as magnetic storms that sometimes affect communications, electric power, and other human activities.|$|E
