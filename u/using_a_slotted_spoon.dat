50|$|The whey used {{is usually}} a {{by-product}} in the production process of other harder cheeses, commonly that of halloumi or kefalotyri cheese. The whey is gradually heated to 65 C in a large cooking bowl. A small amount of goat or sheep milk (5-10%) can be added at this temperature to improve the end product quality. The temperature is then increased to boiling point, whilst mixing. At 80 - 85 C small crumbly curds of anari start forming and are skimmed off the surface <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>slotted</b> <b>spoon</b> or a colander. They are placed in a container that allows further drainage and then cut into cubes of roughly 10 cm sides.Excluding the drainage, the above process takes roughly 1 hour.|$|E

In a large bowl of an {{electric}} mixer, cream together the shortening and sugar until fluffy. Add the eggs and mix until creamy. Gradually add the dry ingredients, alternating with the milk, mixing on low speed, just until well-combined. Place on a floured board. Work the dough lightly with hands, adding a little more flour as needed if it is too sticky. (This dough should be very soft, something like a biscuit dough, so don't add more flour than necessary.) Gently roll {{the dough into a}} 1/2-inch thick rectangle or square. <b>Using</b> <b>a</b> sharp knife, cut into 2-inch squares or similarly sized rectangles. Heat the oil in a deep-sided pot over medium heat to 375 °F. Carefully add the fastnachts to the oil, about 6 per batch, and fry until well-browned on one side, about 2 minutes.

2500|$|The Bohemian Method is {{a recent}} {{invention}} that involves fire, and was not performed during absinthe's peak of popularity in the Belle Époque. Like the French method, a sugar cube is placed on <b>a</b> <b>slotted</b> <b>spoon</b> over <b>a</b> glass containing one shot of absinthe. The sugar is pre-soaked in alcohol (usually more absinthe), then set ablaze. The flaming sugar cube is then dropped into the glass, thus igniting the absinthe. Finally, a shot glass of water is added to douse the flames. This method tends to produce a stronger drink than the French method. A variant of the Bohemian Method involves allowing the fire to extinguish on its own. This variant is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "Cooking the Absinthe" [...] or [...] "The Flaming Green Fairy." [...] The origin of this burning ritual may borrow from a coffee and brandy drink that was served at Café Brûlot, in which a sugar cube soaked in brandy was set aflame. Most experienced absintheurs do not recommend the Bohemian Method and consider it a modern gimmick, as it can destroy the absinthe flavour and present a fire hazard due to the unusually high alcohol content present in absinthe.|$|R
5000|$|Bohemian-style absinth lacks {{much of the}} herbal {{profile and}} density of {{authentic}} absinthe, including the constituents that create the louche.Since this renders Czech style absinth unusable for the traditional method of preparation, a modern ritual involving fire was created. In the “fire ritual,” absinth is poured into a glass, and a sugar cube on <b>a</b> <b>slotted</b> <b>spoon</b> is placed over the glass. The sugar cube is then soaked with absinth and is set on fire. The cube is then dropped into the absinth, setting it ablaze. Then water is poured over the flame until it goes out. Usually, a 1:1 ratio of water to absinth is used. This procedure produces a minor simulation of the louche that is seen in traditional absinthe, and the low water-to-alcohol ratio increases {{the strength of the}} resulting drink. (A traditional absinthe drink is diluted with water to a ratio between 3:1 and 5:1.) Many Czechs do not dilute the drink at all. The fire ritual first appeared in advertisements after having been seen in a Prague bar in the late 1990s. [...] It has been mistaken at times as historical fact due to its having been misrepresented as such in several contemporary costume drama films.|$|R

5000|$|<b>A</b> {{perforated}} or <b>slotted</b> <b>spoon</b> is <b>used</b> {{to dissolve}} <b>a</b> sugar cube {{in a glass}} of absinthe, usually to sweeten the drink and counteract its mild bitterness.

Originating circa the 1870s their use increased over the 1880s and 1890s and were often stamped with brand names or logos as advertising, much like modern alcohol paraphernalia.

Intramedullary fixation devices with a single lag screw have been known to fail at the lag screw insertion hole. Using two lag screws is considered.

While the slot for the upper lag screw might be advantageous with regard to the stresses in the lag screws, it could be detrimental for cut-out occurring adjacent to the lag screws...|$|R
