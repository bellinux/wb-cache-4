50|$|Viral {{particles}} enter a {{plant cell}} and are <b>unencapsidated.</b> At this stage the viral DNA {{consists of three}} fragments, one on the - strand (α) and two on the + strand (β and γ) which are imperfectly assembled into a circular genome with three gaps or discontinuities (D1, D2, and D3).|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of mycoviruses have double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genomes and isometric particles, but approximately 30% have positive sense, single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) genomes. So far {{there is only}} one true example of a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) mycovirus. A geminivirus-related virus was found in Sclerotinia sclerotiorum conferring hypovirulence to its host. The updated 9th ICTV report on virus taxonomy lists over 90 mycovirus species covering 10 viral families, of which 20% were unassigned to a genus or sometimes not even to a family. Isometric forms predominate mycoviral morphologies in comparison to rigid rods, flexuous rods, clubshapedparticles, enveloped bacilliform particles, and Herpesvirus-like viruses. The lack of genomic data often hampers a conclusive assignment to already established groups of viruses or makes it impossible to erect new families and genera. The latter is true for many <b>unencapsidated</b> dsRNA viruses, which are assumed to be viral, but missing sequence data prevented their classification so far. So far, viruses of the families Partitiviridae, Totiviridae, and Narnaviridae are dominating the ‘mycovirus sphere’.|$|E
40|$|The DNA genome of {{cauliflower}} mosaic virus (CaMV) replicates in the cytoplasm of infected plant cells by reverse transcription of an RNA template. Viral RNA is {{generated in the}} nucleus by transcription of an episomal minichromosome containing supercoiled DNA. We have assessed the relative activities of the nuclear and cytoplasmic phases of the CaMV multiplication cycle by monitoring <b>unencapsidated</b> viral DNA forms and polyadenylylated RNAs in different organs of one host plant and in different host species. Systemically infected leaves of a highly susceptible host, turnip (Brassica rapa), contained abundant 35 S RNA and 19 S RNA transcripts and <b>unencapsidated</b> reverse transcription products but relatively little supercoiled DNA. In contrast, supercoiled DNA accumulated in roots and other tissues of turnip plants but without significant amounts of steady-state viral RNA. Infected but asymptomatic leaves of a less susceptible CaMV host, kohlrabi (Brassica oleracea), contained supercoiled DNA almost exclusively but negligible viral RNA and DNA products of reverse transcription. An allotetraploid species, rape (Brassica napus), exhibited infection characteristics and minichromosome expression levels intermediate between the other two species from which it was derived. We conclude that expression of the CaMV minichromosome is a key phase of the virus multiplication cycle, which is regulated differentially in organs of a highly susceptible host species. Furthermore, this regulation exhibits genetic variation among different Brassica species and controls host susceptibility to CaMV infection...|$|E
40|$|Barley tissue with {{an acute}} {{systemic}} infection of barley stripe mosaic virus contained {{a large amount}} of <b>unencapsidated</b> virus RNA which was stable in extracts made in ribosome isolation buffer. The virus RNA in ribosome preparations sedimented in a broad band at 80 S to 100 S in sucrose gradients, which is less than the virion sedimentation rate of 180 S to 200 S. A protein of apparent Mr 60 000, which sedimented with the virus RNA, was present in ribosome extracts from infected plants but absent from those from uninfected plants. The protein is probably a virus protein because its apparent molecular weight varied slightly with the strain of virus. The structure containing the Mr 60000 protein did not sediment in sucrose gradients in a compact zone as would be expected for a particle of uniform size. The Mr 60000 protein was present at a concentration equal to or slightly higher (up to 400 µg/g leaf tissue) than the <b>unencapsidated</b> virus RNA (up to 300 µg/g leaf tissue). Sedimentation results support the conclusion that the virus RNA and the Mr 60000 protein were combined in polydispersed nucleoprotein particles {{which may or may not}} have been attached to ribosomes or ribosome subunits. The Mr 60 000 protein was not serologically related to the capsid protein. Gold-labelled antibodies to the Mr 60000 protein stained the cytoplasm in thin sections of infected cells but not that of uninfected cells. However, no distinct immunogold-labelled particle could be identified as the presumed nucleoprotein...|$|E
40|$|The {{double-stranded}} DNA genome {{of human}} hepatitis B virus (HBV) and related hepadnaviruses is reverse transcribed from a pregenomic RNA by a viral polymerase (Pol) harboring both priming and RNA- and DNA-dependent elongation activities. Although hepadnavirus replication occurs inside viral nucleocapsids, or cores, biochemical systems for analyzing this reaction are currently limited to <b>unencapsidated</b> Pols expressed in heterologous systems. Here, we describe cis and trans classes of replicative HBV cores, {{produced in the}} recombinant baculovirus system via coexpression of HBV core and Pol proteins from either a single RNA (i. e., in cis) or two distinct RNAs (in trans). Upon isolation from insect cells, cis and trans cores contained Pol-linked HBV minus-strand DNA with 5 ′ ends mapping to the authentic elongation origin DR 1 and also plus-strand DNA species. Only trans cores, however, were highly active for the de novo priming and reverse transcription of authentic HBV minus strands in in vitro endogenous polymerase assays. This reaction strictly required HBV Pol but not the ɛ stem-loop element, although the presence of one ɛ, or better, two ɛs, enhanced minus-strand synthesis up to 10 -fold. Compared to <b>unencapsidated</b> Pol enzymes, encapsidated Pol appeared to be (i) highly processive, able to extend minus-strand DNAs of 400 nucleotides from DR 1 in vitro, and (ii) more active for HBV plus-strand synthesis. These observations suggest possible contributions to the replication process from the HBV core protein. These novel core reagents should facilitate the analysis of HBV replication in its natural environment, {{the interior of the}} capsid, and also fuel the development of new anti-HBV drug screens...|$|E
40|$|The {{exploration}} {{of the evolution of}} RNA viruses has been aided recently by the discovery of copies of fragments or complete genomes of non-retroviral RNA viruses (Non-retroviral Endogenous RNA Viral Elements, or NERVEs) in many eukaryotic nuclear genomes. Among the most prominent NERVEs are partial copies of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) of the mitoviruses in plant mitochondrial genomes. Mitoviruses are in the family Narnaviridae, which are the simplest viruses, encoding only a single protein (the RdRP) in their <b>unencapsidated</b> viral plus strand. Narnaviruses are known only in fungi, and the origin of plant mitochondrial mitovirus NERVEs appears to be horizontal transfer from plant pathogenic fungi. At least one mitochondrial mitovirus NERVE, but not its nuclear copy, is expressed...|$|E
40|$|Several {{different}} forms of cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) DNA were detected in nucleic acid preparations from CaMV-infected turnip leaves. As well as supercoiled and open-circular molecules, various linear DNA structures were identified. The relative amounts of these DNA forms varied in plants infected with different CaMV isolates. Restriction enzyme mapping and one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of linear molecules apparently formed by breaks in the second strand {{at each of the}} three discontinuities. Two major linear DNA forms are double-stranded over part of their length and appear to have single-stranded extensions of the -strand of variable length. Since these DNA forms are not produced during extraction and probably exist as <b>unencapsidated</b> or partially encapsidated molecules, they may represent intermediates either in DNA replication or in virion assembly...|$|E

40|$|Incompletely reconstituted {{particles}} of tobacco mosaic virus treated with moderate concentrations of dimethylsulfoxide prior to electron microscopy have two visible tails of <b>unencapsidated</b> RNA, {{a long one}} and a short one. The short tail has a constant length of 720 +/- 80 nucleotides in incomplete {{particles of}} diverse size and probably corresponds to the 3 'OH end of the RNA. The length of the long 5 ' tail is inversely related {{to the length of}} the unfinished rod. Surprisingly, both tails appear to protrude from the same end of the particle. These observations suggest that the strand of RNA coming out of one end of the particle loops back {{along the length of the}} rod so as to appear at the opposite end. The "looped-back" tail almost certainly passes down the empty central channel of the incomplete rod. The findings are compatible with a model of tobacco mosaic virus assembly in which the RNA inserts itself beneath layers of incoming protein from within the central channel...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAlthough {{previous}} work identified 12 complementation groups with possible roles in virus assembly, currently only one frog virus 3 protein, the major capsid protein (MCP), {{has been linked}} with virion formation. To identify other proteins required for assembly, we used an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide to target 53 R, a putative myristoylated membrane protein, and showed that treatment resulted in marked reductions in 53 R levels and a 60 % drop in virus titers. Immunofluorescence assays confirmed knock down and showed that 53 R was found primarily within viral assembly sites, whereas transmission electron microscopy detected fewer mature virions and, in some cells, dense granular bodies that may represent <b>unencapsidated</b> DNA-protein complexes. Treatment with a myristoylation inhibitor (2 -hydroxymyristic acid) resulted in an 80 % reduction in viral titers. Collectively, these data indicate that 53 R is an essential viral protein that is required for replication in vitro and suggest it plays {{a critical role in}} virion formation...|$|E
40|$|RNase mapping {{was used}} to {{estimate}} the levels of <b>unencapsidated</b> Sendai virus plus-strand RNAs which cross the leader-NP junction relative to NP mRNA. Significant amounts of leader readthrough RNAs were found in Z strain-infected cells, similar to that described for the polR mutant of vesicular stomatitis virus, even though this strain is considered wild type. The levels of the readthrough RNAs detected fell sharply when progressively longer probes were used, unlike that of NP mRNA. These studies suggest that polymerases which read through the first junction terminate shortly afterwards {{in the absence of}} concurrent assembly of the nascent chain, whereas those which reinitiate at NP continue efficiently to the next junction. Reinitiation appears to be necessary to convert the polymerase to a mode in which elongation is independent of concurrent assembly. Concurrent assembly appears to be required not only for the polymerase to read through the junction efficiently, but also for it to continue elongation between junctions...|$|E
40|$|A new 1 -hydroxy- 2, 6 -pyrazinedione, sclerominol (1), was {{isolated}} from cultures of hypovirulent isolates of Sclerotinia minor, a fungal plant pathogen associated with lettuce drop and other plant diseases. This compound {{was characterized by}} NMR, mass spectrometry, and X-ray crystallography. One other 1 -hydroxy- 2, 6 -pyrazinedione, flutimide, has been reported. Flutimide has activity as an inhibitor of influenza virus endonuclease, and therefore, sclerominol was evaluated for related biological activity. Sclerominol (1) displayed some activity against cancer cell lines but little activity against three influenza virus strains. The role of 1 in the physiology of hypovirulent isolates of S. minor has not been determined, but 1 has also been recovered from debilitated isolates of S. sclerotiorum. Hypovirulent isolates of fungal plant pathogens, which have a reduced ability to cause disease, are being examined for potential application in plant disease management.

40|$|Hypovirulence of the {{pathogenic}} fungus Cryphonectria parasitica, {{caused by}} the <b>unencapsidated</b> viral double-stranded RNA of Cryphonectria hypovirus (CHV 1), provides a means for biological control of chestnut blight.

The conserved regions of the putative RNA polymerase encoded by strain CHV 1 - 713 were cloned and expressed, and the recombinant protein was purified and used to produce polyclonal antibodies. The CHV 1 replication complex was solubilized from a membrane fraction of CHV 1 -infected C. parasitica hyphae. Antibodies raised against the putative viral polymerase reacted on a Western immunoblot with an 87 -kDa polypeptide of the replication complex but not with comparable preparations from an isogenic uninfected strain.

40|$|Five <b>unencapsidated,</b> {{intracellular}} {{forms of}} cauliflower mosaic virus DNA which accumulate in infected turnip leaves are described. The forms are double stranded (or partially double stranded), and one (form iv) is a covalently-closed circular {{form of the}} full-length genome. Form i is an open form composed of full-length genome strands (7. 6 kilobases) similar to encapsidated viral DNA. Form iii appears as a diffuse band on gels and is composed of two approximately half length strands (approximately 3. 8 kb) spanning {{the region of the}} genome between the two site-specific DNA breaks (delta 1 and delta 2). Form ii is composed of a full length strand and an approximately half-length strand as described for form iii DNA. Form v is a small form (approximately 0. 7 kilobase in undenatured form) that maps adjacent to the alpha-strand break (delta 1) and may be a foldback form. These forms appear to be intermediates in cauliflower mosaic virus DNA replication and the properties of these forms are consistent with possible intermediates in a model of reverse transcriptional replication of the viral genome...|$|E
40|$|Explants {{taken from}} turnip leaves {{infected}} systemically with cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) proliferate callus tissue when cultured on an appropriate medium. CaMV DNA, detected by spot hybridization, {{was found to}} persist in these cultured cells for at least 45 days. Analysis of <b>unencapsidated</b> virus DNA by blot hybridization after agarose gel electrophoresis howed that the truncated DNA forms characteristic of infected leaf tissue were virtually absent from callus cells. These cells contained predominantly genome-length supercoiled CaMV DNA together with discrete subgenomic supercoiled forms. Interest in cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) has centred around {{the nature of its}} 8 kilobase pair (kbp) double-stranded circular DNA genome which contains three single-strand discontinuities, the expression and function of its genes, its replication cycle apparently involving reverse transcription, and its potential as a plant gene vector (for reviews, see Hohn et al., 1982; Hull & Davies, 1983; Hull & Covey, 1983 a).

40|$|Transmissions {{of virus}} using the aphid Myzus persicae were {{performed}} using plants co-infected with two cucumoviruses, tomato aspermy virus (V-TAV) and cucumber mosaic virus (M-CMV). Five of the aphid-transmitted progeny viruses (3 - 7 %) induced symptoms distinct from those induced by either parental virus. Northern blot hybridization analysis of encapsidated RNAs from these novel progeny demonstrated {{that all of}} the RNA profiles were characteristic of pseudo-recombinants, i. e. viruses with reassorted genomic RNAs. The two larger RNAs, 1 and 2, originated from V-TAV, whereas RNA 3 was derived from M-CMV. A more sensitive RNase protection assay analysis of both <b>unencapsidated</b> and encapsidated RNAs revealed the presence of minor populations of V-TAV-derived RNA 3 in all of these novel progeny, and of M-CMV-derived RNA 1 (and presumably RNA 2) in one of the progeny. A bias against he encapsidation of the minor popula-tions of RNAs by the M-CMV coat protein was observed, suggesting that there is specificity or compe-tition with regard to the encapsidation of cucumoviral RNAs in vivo.

40|$|Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) DNA {{has been}} shown to exist as a linear, {{double-stranded}} molecule in the virion and as a non-linear (endless), episomal, nucleosomal form in latently infected trigeminal ganglia. The kinetics of the formation and appearance of endless viral genomes and the stability of linear genomes in neuronal cells are not well understood. Nerve growth factor (NGF) -differentiated PC 12 cells can sustain long-term, quiescent infections with HSV- 1. In this report, the structure and stability of HSV- 1 viral DNA in NGF-differentiated PC 12 cells was studied as a function of time following infection using both wild-type and replication-defective virus. Unexpectedly, <b>unencapsidated</b> linear genomes were stable in the nucleus of NGF-differentiated PC 12 cells for up to 2 – 3 weeks following infection, beyond the period at which there is no detectable viral gene expression. However, following infection with wild-type HSV, the majority of quiescent viral genomes were in an endless form after 3 – 4 weeks. These data suggest that the stability and fate of HSV- 1 DNA in non-mitotic neuronal-like cells is different from that in productively infected cells and thus there is a significant cellular role in this process. The relevance to the virus life-cycle in neurones in vivo is discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{capsid protein}} gene of tobacco ringspot virus (TobRV), {{which had been}} {{modified}} to contain an amino-terminal methionine codon, was ligated into a baculovirus transfer vector downstream from the polyhedrin promoter. The resulting plasmid was cotransfected with linearized baculovirus DNA into insect cells. Recombinant baculovirus expressed high levels of the TobRV capsid protein that assembled to form virus-like particles that were similar in size and shape to authentic TobRV capsids. These virus-like particles did not encapsidate any RNA, including the capsid protein mRNA. The capsid protein mRNA is a truncated RNA 2, which may lack a putative encapsidation signal. To determine whether an intact packaging substrate could be encapsidated by the TobRV capsid protein, another recombinant baculovirus, concomitantly expressing both capsid protein and TobRV satellite RNA, was constructed. Surprisingly, {{the vast majority of}} the satellite RNA molecules expressed from this recombinant baculovirus were ligated in the insect cells to form circular RNA molecules. Like circular forms of satellite RNA generatedin planta,these circular satellite molecules remained <b>unencapsidated</b> by the TobRV capsid protein. Computer-generated three-dimensional reconstruction using electron cryomicrographs of the empty virus-like particles allowed the first structural analyses of any nepovirus capsid. This 22 -Å resolution reconstruction resembled capsids of other members of the picornavirus superfamily. These data support the hypothesis that the nepovirus capsid is structurally analogous to those of the como- and picornaviruses...|$|E
40|$|We have {{utilized}} deletion mutants of adeno-associated virus (AAV) to investigate which {{elements of the}} AAV genome are required in cis for high yields of the wild-type virus in a plasmid transfection assay and in addition whether these elements affect primarily AAV DNA replication or encapsidation. All tested deletions from within the Rep region demonstrated a modest, approximately threefold, decrease in viral production. Deletions within the cap region resulted in markedly less virus. Previous observations suggested that in cells in which recom-binant AAV (rAAV) was produced, as in our assay with the helper plasmid pDG, {{there is a substantial}} excess of empty capsids. Cotransfections of high- and low-yielding constructs demonstrated that under conditions where Cap is abundant, the constructs with cap deletions did not package efficiently. These observation suggest that the lower yields of rAAV cannot be entirely due to lack of capsids but that elements within the cap region of the wild-type genome are important for efficient encapsidation. The production of virus by the mutants we tested was, however, not consistent with the disruption of a cis-acting packaging signal. Apparently, when Cap is provided “in trans, ” encapsidation is inefficient. A second observation is that there were equivalent amounts of replicated but <b>unencapsidated</b> viral DNA in cells transfected with each of our constructs. We propose that, in accord with the previously proposed link between DNA replication and encapsidation, the total amount of AAV DNA replication can be limited by the efficiency of encapsidation...|$|E
40|$|RNA {{silencing}} is {{a potent}} means of antiviral defense in plants and animals. A hallmark of this defense response is the production of 21 - to 24 -nucleotide viral small RNAs via mechanisms that remain to be fully understood. Many viruses encode suppressors of RNA silencing, and some viral RNAs function directly as silencing suppressors as counterdefense. The occurrence of viroid-specific small RNAs in infected plants suggests that viroids can trigger RNA silencing in a host, raising {{the question of how}} these noncoding and <b>unencapsidated</b> RNAs survive cellular RNA-silencing systems. We address this question by characterizing the production of small RNAs of Potato spindle tuber viroid (srPSTVds) and investigating how PSTVd responds to RNA silencing. Our molecular and biochemical studies provide evidence that srPSTVds were derived mostly from the secondary structure of viroid RNAs. Replication of PSTVd was resistant to RNA silencing, although the srPSTVds were biologically active in guiding RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) -mediated cleavage, as shown with a sensor system. Further analyses showed that without possessing or triggering silencing suppressor activities, the PSTVd secondary structure {{played a critical role in}} resistance to RISC-mediated cleavage. These findings support the hypothesis that some infectious RNAs may have evolved specific secondary structures as an effective means to evade RNA silencing in addition to encoding silencing suppressor activities. Our results should have important implications in further studies on RNA-based mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions and the biological constraints that shape the evolution of infectious RNA structures...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} susceptibilities and symptom {{responses of}} different Brassica species to infection by cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) have been compared {{and related to}} molecular events of the virus multiplication cycle. Variants ofB. rapa (genome descriptor aa) were highly susceptible to infection by CaMV strain Cabb B-JI and contained relatively large amounts of virus; B. oleracea (cc) variants howed low susceptibility and contained small amounts of virus. B. nigra (bb) and allotetraploid species, B. juncea (aabb), B. napus (aacc) and B. carinata (bbcc), showed moderate responses to CaMV. CaMV <b>unencapsidated</b> DNA forms were isolated from different Brassica plants and examined by two-dimen-sional gel electrophoresis and blot hybridization. Viral RNA was estimated by dot blot analysis. These analyses howed differences in accumulation of key viral replication cycle intermediates within {{the broad range of}} host plants studied. The most susceptible species contained relatively small amounts of super-coiled (SC) DNA, a component of the CaMV mini-chromosome, but abundant viral transcripts and re-verse transcription replication products. Tolerant plant hosts contained high levels of SC DNA but low levels of viral transcripts and reverse transcription DNA pro-ducts. Allotetraploids contained SC DNA, RNA transcripts and replication product levels which were generally intermediate between those of their respec-tive progenitor species. Evidence is presented that accumulation fCaMV SC DNA in the less susceptible host species is probably not due to autonomous DNA replication or tissue-specific expression. We conclude that a major component of the susceptibility of Brassica plants (and probably all CaMV host species) to CaMV infection is the level of viral minichromo-some expression, influenced directly by the host genotype...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In the 1970 s, mycoviruses were {{identified}} that infected the edible mushroom Lentinula edodes (shiitake), {{but they were}} not regarded as causal agents for mushroom diseases. None of their genes has been sequenced. In this study, the dsRNA genome of a mycovirus recently found in a shiitake commercial strain was sequenced and its molecular structure was characterized. Methods A cDNA library was constructed from a dsRNA purified from the fruiting body of L. edodes. The virus was tentatively named L. edodes mycovirus HKB (LeV). Based on the deduced RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) sequence, phylogenetic analysis of LeV was conducted. Because no virion particles associated with the dsRNA were observed by electron microscopic observation, atomic force microscopy (AFM) observation was chosen for achieving molecular imaging of the virus. Results The 11, 282 -bp genome of LeV was obtained. The genome encoded two open reading frames (ORFs). ORF 1 coded for a hypothetical protein and ORF 2 for a putative RdRp, respectively. In addition, a region coding for a NUDIX domain was present in ORF 1. There was a 62 -bp intergenic region between ORF 1 and RdRp. Similarity with coat protein of mycoviruses was not found within the whole sequence. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the putative RdRp sequence, LeV grouped into a clade with dsRNA found in the basidiomycetes Phlebiopsis gigantea and Helicobasidium mompa. The clade was placed apart from the Totiviridae and Chrysoviridae families. As suggested from the genome sequence, AFM revealed that the structure of LeV was linear <b>unencapsidated</b> dsRNA. Conclusions The results suggest that LeV represents a novel family of mycoviruses, found thus far only among the basidiomycetes. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Mycoviruses are {{viruses that}} {{naturally}} infect and replicate in fungi. Aspergillus fumigatus, an opportunistic pathogen causing fungal lung diseases in humans and animals, was recently shown to harbour several {{different types of}} mycoviruses. A well-characterised defence against virus infection is RNA silencing. The A. fumigatus genome encodes essential components of the RNA silencing machinery, including Dicer, Argonaute and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) homologues. Active silencing of double-stranded (ds) RNA and the generation of small RNAs (sRNAs) has been shown for several mycoviruses and it is anticipated that a similar mechanism will be activated in A. fumigatus isolates infected with mycoviruses. Results: To investigate the existence and nature of A. fumigatus sRNAs, sRNA-seq libraries of virus-free and virus-infected isolates were created using Scriptminer adapters and compared. Three dsRNA viruses were investigated: Aspergillus fumigatus partitivirus- 1 (AfuPV- 1, PV), Aspergillus fumigatus chrysovirus (AfuCV, CV) and Aspergillus fumigatus tetramycovirus- 1 (AfuTmV- 1, NK) which were selected because they induce phenotypic changes such as coloration and sectoring. The dsRNAs of all three viruses, which included two conventionally encapsidated ones PV and CV and one <b>unencapsidated</b> example NK, were silenced and yielded characteristic vsiRNAs together with co-incidental silencing of host fungal genes which shared sequence homology with the viral genomes. Conclusions: Virus-derived sRNAs were detected and characterised {{in the presence of}} virus infection. Differentially expressed A. fumigatus microRNA-like (miRNA-like) sRNAs and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were detected and validated. Host sRNA loci which were differentially expressed as a result of virus infection were also identified. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the sRNA profiles of A. fumigatus isolates...|$|E
40|$|Systemic {{induction}} of pathogenesis-related (PR) {{proteins in}} tobacco, which occurs during the hypersensitive response to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), {{may be caused}} by a minimum 10 -fold systemic increase in endogenous levels of salicylic acid (SA). This rise in SA parallels PR- 1 protein induction and occurs in TMV-resistant Xanthi-nc tobacco carrying the N gene, but not in TMV-susceptible (nn) tobacco. By feeding SA to excised leaves of Xanthi-nc (NN) tobacco, we have shown that the observed increase in endogenous SA levels is sufficient for the systemic induction of PR- 1 proteins. TMV infection became systemic and Xanthi-nc plants failed to accumulate PR- 1 proteins at 32 degrees C. This loss of hypersensitive response at high temperature was associated with an inability to accumulate SA. However, spraying leaves with SA induced PR- 1 proteins at both 24 and 32 degrees C. SA is most likely exported from the primary site of infection to the uninfected tissues. A computer model predicts that SA should move rapidly in phloem. When leaves of Xanthi-nc tobacco were excised 24 hr after TMV inoculation and exudates from the cut petioles were collected, the increase in endogenous SA in TMV-inoculated leaves paralleled SA levels in exudates. Exudation and leaf accumulation of SA were proportional to TMV concentration and were higher in light than in darkness. Different components of TMV were compared for their ability to induce SA accumulation and exudation: three different aggregation states of coat protein failed to induce SA, but <b>unencapsidated</b> viral RNA elicited SA accumulation in leaves and phloem. These results further support the hypothesis that SA acts as an endogenous signal that triggers local and systemic induction of PR- 1 proteins and, possibly, some components of systemic acquired resistance in NN tobacco...|$|E
