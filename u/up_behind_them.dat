5|$|These {{monitors}} {{will rise}} {{up on their}} hind legs to check their surroundings, a behavior that has also been documented in Gould's monitors (V.gouldii). They are known to exhibit a warning posture, in which they carry their tails rolled <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>them.</b> According to native belief, they will give a warning call if they see crocodiles. In general V.salvadorii avoids human contact, but its bite is capable of causing infection, like the Komodo dragon's. One fatality was reported from a bite in 1983 when a Papuan woman was bitten and later died from an infection.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{is divided into}} 14 missions in which the player plays as Joanna Dark. Each mission provides a number of objectives that the player has to complete to progress. To successfully clear a mission, the player must complete all primary objectives, and if Joanna is killed or fails an objective, the player will have to start the level again. The missions also feature optional objectives that are not critical but add to the player's overall completion score. Some objectives require the player to use numerous high-tech gadgets. For example, a device called Datathief allows the player to hack into electronic devices, while another called Loctopus {{can be used to}} open locked doors. Stealth is another important element of the gameplay, as the player is often given the freedom to kill enemies without being detected by sneaking <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>them.</b> Unlike the original Perfect Dark, every mission contains a single checkpoint at which the player may restart if Joanna is killed or loses beyond that checkpoint. However, checkpoints are removed as the player plays through a higher difficulty. There are four difficulty settings through which a mission can be played: Agent, Secret Agent, Perfect Agent, and an extra one called Dark Agent, which becomes available once the player completes the entire game on Perfect Agent. As the player plays on higher difficulties, the game adds more objectives and makes enemies tougher to increase the challenge.|$|E
5|$|Several {{groups of}} men {{eventually}} {{made their way}} to Pine Ridge. Among the first was Lieutenant Eric Plant's platoon from the 9th Battalion. Captain John Whitham's company of the 12th Battalion moved forward from Bolton's Ridge when they saw the 6th Battalion moving <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>them.</b> As the 6th Battalion reached the ridge, the companies carried on towards Gun Ridge, while Lieutenant-Colonel Walter McNicoll established the battalion headquarters below Bolton's Ridge. As the 6th Battalion moved forward they were engaged by Turkish small arms and artillery fire, causing heavy casualties. At 10:00 brigade headquarters received a message from the 6th Battalion asking for reinforcement, and McCay sent half the 5th Battalion to assist. At the same time the 8th Battalion were digging in on Bolton's, except for two companies which moved forward to attack a group of Turks that had come up from the south behind the 6th Battalion. By noon the 8th Battalion was dug in on the ridge; in front of them were scattered remnants of the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 9th Battalions, mostly out of view of each other in the scrub. Shortly after, McCay was informed that if he wanted the 6th Battalion to hold its position, it must be reinforced. So McCay sent his last reserves, a company of the 1st Battalion, and ordered the 8th to leave one company on the ridge and advance on the right of the 6th Battalion. The scattered formations managed to hold their positions {{for the remainder of the}} afternoon, then at 17:00 saw large numbers of Turkish troops coming over the southern section of Gun Ridge.|$|E

At {{the end of the}} fight, exhausted from more than 15 hours of continuous combat, out of contact with their division, and out of ammunition, after Bouck and most of his men had been wounded, the platoon was overrun by German soldiers. The remaining 15 men were captured and were prisoners of war in freezing, disease-infested prison camps for five months until the war ended, and were near death when their own Army division freed them.|$|E
25|$|The {{player can}} direct Drake to take cover behind corners or low walls using either aimed or blind-fire {{to kill his}} enemies. The player can also have Drake fire while moving. If Drake is undetected by his enemies, the player can attempt to use stealth to take them out, such as by sneaking <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>them</b> and killing them with one hit, or by {{dropping}} down onto an enemy whilst Drake is hanging from a ledge. The stealth mechanic has been simplified and improved. Some areas of the game will require the player to solve puzzles {{with the use of}} Drake's journal, which provides clues towards the puzzles' solutions. When enabled, a hint system provides gameplay clues, such as the direction of the next objective.|$|E

Mick pulls <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>them</b> but Ian drives away, so Rainie, a prostitute, propositions Mick. He says he is not interested, and then the police arrive. Rainie claims Mick is a regular punter, so he is arrested for soliciting. Later, Ian explains that he had sex with Rainie on the night his daughter Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater) was murdered, so Mick agrees not to tell anyone, though he is forced to tell Linda when she receives a call from his solicitor. Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell) overhears this and supports Linda at the court. Mick pleads guilty, and Cora discovers that the prostitute is her daughter. She reveals Mick's alleged crime to everyone in The Vic. Linda hates that Mick has put Ian before his own family, so Mick resolves to make Ian tell the truth to his partner Denise Fox (Diane Parish).|$|E

25|$|Uncharted 2 is an action-adventure {{platform}} {{video game}} played from a third-person view, with the player {{in control of}} Nathan Drake. Drake is physically adept {{and is able to}} jump, climb, and scale narrow ledges and wall-faces to get between points. Drake can be equipped with up to two firearms – one single-handed and one two-handed – and a limited supply of grenades. Drake can pick up weapons, automatically replacing the existing weapon he was using, and additional ammunition from slain enemies. The player can direct Drake to take cover behind corners or low walls using either aimed or blind-fire to kill his enemies. The player can also have Drake fire while moving. If Drake is undetected by his enemies, the player can attempt to use stealth to take them out, such as by sneaking <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>them</b> to knock them out with one hit, or by pulling an unsuspecting foe over a ledge from which Drake is hanging. In most areas, if all of the foes patrolling are killed stealthily then other waves that would normally appear do not. Some areas of the game require the player to solve puzzles with the use of Drake's journal, which provides clues towards the puzzles' solutions. When enabled, a hint system provides gameplay clues, such as the direction of the next objective.|$|E
25|$|On 8 February 1814, Bellegarde and Eugene clashed in the Battle of the Mincio River. After Eugene {{threw the}} bulk of his army across the Mincio River, he bumped into the Austrian left wing. The French array was drawn up with Quesnel's {{division}} on the left, Rouyer's division on the right, Marcognet and the Italian Guard in reserve, and cavalry on the flanks. After brisk fighting, Quesnel's soldiers cleared the Austrians out of the village of Pozzolo. As the Franco-Italians pressed their enemies north toward Valeggio sul Mincio and Borghetto, Eugene sent Quesnel and Rouyer to the left and brought Marcognet into the front line. Meanwhile, Bellegarde and the Austrian right wing crossed the Mincio near Borghetto and were overpowering Verdier's weak left wing. When they found Eugene's main body coming <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>them,</b> Bellegarde's Austrians fell back in confusion. The Franco-Italians counted 3,000 killed and wounded and 500 captured out of 34,000 men engaged. Austrian casualties numbered 2,800 killed and wounded plus 1,200 captured out of 32,000. At Pozzolo the Austrian grenadier brigade was mauled, suffering 790 casualties. In Quesnel's division, Campi's brigade included one battalion each of the 1st Light, 14th Light, and 10th Line, as well as three battalions of the 92nd Line. Forestier's brigade had three battalions of the 84th Line and one battalion of the 35th Line.|$|E

500|$|During {{the initial}} phase A Company had {{attacked}} southwest along a spur leading to Hill 317 and had met stiff opposition.

Meanwhile, D Company continued to press their attack along the high ground towards the 'Uniform' feature, assaulting the deeply entrenched Chinese positions, which included heavy automatic weapons. By 16:00 it had successfully captured the last of [...] the intermediate objectives assigned to it and a platoon from B Company was pushed forward to assist in the clearance of the feature. Later, Lieutenant L.G. Clark was awarded the Military Cross while Sergeant W.J. Rowlinson was awarded a bar to his Distinguished Conduct Medal for their actions during the fighting. By this time total Chinese casualties included 98 killed and 40 captured, while the Australians believed {{that a large number of}} Chinese had also been wounded. Following the progress of B and D Companies, C Company was moved <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>them</b> and with the capture of final objective they immediately commenced an assault on Hill 317, capturing 10 prisoners for no loss. Although the Chinese had been well dug-in, there were no barbed wire obstacles to hamper the attackers and the Australians had rapidly gained the position. By 17:00, Maryang San had fallen to the Australians, with the Chinese withdrawing under heavy artillery, mortar and machine-gun fire.|$|E
