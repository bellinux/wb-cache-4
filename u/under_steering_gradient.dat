This paper presents the prediction and correlation of full {{vehicle handling}} with ADAMS/Car. After building the initial model, major flexible component, steering friction and damping was introduced to optimize the model that makes the model much more accurate. The model will be used to run four major vehicle handling events; the predicted results are compared with measured data. The correlation includes time history of steering wheel angle, steering torque, lateral acceleration, side slip angle, roll, yaw etc. It also includes the derivates such as understeer <b>gradients,</b> <b>steering</b> <b>gradients,</b> side slip gradients, roll gradients etc. It is shown that good correlations are obtained in handling...|$|R

40|$|Magnetic Resonance Navigation (MRN) {{relies on}} the use of an {{upgraded}} clinical Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner to navigate therapeutic, imaging, or diagnostic magnetic micro‐agents in the vascular network. Although the high homogeneous field in the tunnel of the MRI scanner increases the magnetization of the navigable agents towards full saturation, the magnetic gradients superposed on such a high homogeneous field, generated by the Imaging Gradient Coils (IGC) typically used for MR‐image slice selection, allow the induction of pulling forces to steer such agents in the targeted branches at the vessel’s bifurcations. However, increasing the magnitude of such gradients leads to a significant decrease of the duty cycle, leading to a substantial reduction of the effective steering force being applied. To increase such a duty cycle, a <b>Steering</b> <b>Gradient</b> Coils (SGC) assembly capable of higher magnitudes while maintaining a 100 % duty cycle can be installed at the cost of a much slower slew rate. Here, the use and the potential effectiveness of IGC and/or SGC for guiding such agents are briefly investigated on the basis of known specifications and experimental data...|$|R

40|$|Interventional devices with {{ferromagnetic}} components can {{be manipulated}} remotely using forces induced by the MRI gradients. To deflect the tip of an endovascular catheter, large ferromagnetic spheres of 2 mm diameter are required to exert sufficiently high magnetic forces; however, tracking of these devices is difficult due to the large image artifacts. In this study, a new dual-echo technique is proposed to improve the stability of localizing and tracking medical devices with ferromagnetic components. MR tracking methods with selective off-resonant excitation and phase compensation with a rephasing gradient can detect ferromagnetic spheres up to a diameter of 1 mm only. In this work, a dual-echo technique is used with two rephasing gradients to stabilize the off-set localization. With rephasing being applied in orthogonal directions, an SNR of 5 was achieved in the signal projections. Compared to a single-echo acquisition the dual-echo method reduces the position error in a phantom from 8 mm to 1. 6 mm. In an in vivo study a tracking precision of 4 mm was measured without <b>steering</b> <b>gradients</b> at an image update rate of 2 images per second.

50|$|RPR {{works on}} a concept of dual counter {{rotating}} rings called ringlets. These ringlets are set up by creating RPR stations at nodes where traffic is supposed to drop, per flow (a flow is the ingress and egress of data traffic). RPR uses Media Access Control protocol (MAC) messages to direct the traffic, which can use either ringlet of the ring. The nodes also negotiate for bandwidth among themselves using fairness algorithms, avoiding congestion and failed spans. The avoidance of failed spans is accomplished by using one of two techniques known as <b>steering</b> and wrapping. <b>Under</b> <b>steering,</b> if a node or span is broken, all nodes are notified of a topology change and they reroute their traffic. In wrapping, the traffic is looped back at the last node prior to the break and routed to the destination station.|$|R

The analyzing results indicate that the test system based on active braking control can effectively assist vehicle travelling in the absence of ESP control or ESP control system failure; when vehicle has ESP control system, the driving stability control performance of this system and independent vehicle system has remarkable consistency.

50|$|Liquid {{sloshing}} strongly {{influences the}} directional dynamics and safety performance of highway tank vehicles {{in a highly}} adverse manner. Hydrodynamic forces and moments arising from liquid cargo oscillations in the tank <b>under</b> <b>steering</b> and/or braking maneuvers reduce the stability limit and controllability of partially-filled tank vehicles. Anti-slosh devices such as baffles are widely used in order to limit the adverse liquid slosh effect on directional performance and stability of the tank vehicles. Since most of the time, tankers are carrying dangerous liquid contents such as ammonia, gasoline and fuel oils; therefore stability of partially-filled liquid cargo vehicles is very important. Optimizations and sloshing reduction techniques in fuel tanks such as elliptical tank, rectangular, modified oval and generic tank shape have been performed in different filling levels using numerical, analytical and analogical analyses. Most of these studies concentrate on effects of baffles on sloshing while the influence of cross-section is completely ignored.|$|R
40|$|The leading {{automotive}} {{manufacturers have}} attempted to apply active brake systems to passenger and commercial vehicles. The ESC (electronic stability control) system helps drivers to maintain directional stability and control over <b>steering</b> and <b>under</b> <b>steering.</b> Previous studies on passenger vehicle ESC systems have mainly dealt with the control algorithm and evaluation results. In addition, few papers have considered bus and commercial ESC systems. Therefore, this study proposed a method for estimating the desired yaw rate using the already developed ESC system. The desired yaw rate is estimated from the steering wheel angle, vehicle speed, and vehicle parameters. This paper {{presents the results of}} a sine with dwell evaluation analysis of a large bus equipped with an ESC system. Through this process, we are able to estimate the ESC control strategy of the leading producer of commercial buses based on an air brake system.

40|$|Abstract: Quality of Service (QoS) becomes {{necessary}} for service-oriented computing. Web Services Agreement (WSA) aims at defining a language and a protocol for advertising {{the capabilities of}} providers, creating agreements based on creational offers, and monitoring of QoS. On the other hand, semantic web provides many burgeoning techniques that enable services intelligent and automatic on the web. Therefore, we intend to integrate semantic web techniques with WSA management to utilize its advantages. In this paper, we present some works for this study. We illustrate how to specify WSA with ontology language instead of XML schema. With this, WSA can be domain ontology to describe knowledge of service agreement, and be a unified information model for it. In addition, an agent-based runtime framework is presented for WSA management, where all agents share the WSA ontology for exchange and negotiation. This improves interoperability between these agents. The negotiation rules and policies are specially described with Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) for web service, and agents negotiate with each other <b>under</b> <b>steering</b> of such rules and policies...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{absorbing}} {{foam padding}} is widely applied in various areas of modern cars {{in conjunction with}} increasing number of airbags as passive safety systems. High efficient energy absorbing foams {{which can be used}} to optimise energy absorption or minimise packaging space are particularly popular. Foam padding is applied in doors for pelvis and thorax protection, behind headliners for head impact protection, in knee bolsters and <b>under</b> <b>steering</b> columns for knee impact protection, in the foot well area for ankle- and tibia protection and in bumpers to meet competing pedestrian, pendulum and insurance requirements. Since passive safety systems are developed with the aid of modern virtual simulation software such as LS-DYNA, it is imperative to have accurate and reliable material models for the energy absorbing systems used for the said applications. This paper describes the material model validation of high efficient energy absorbing foam based on a test matrix of physical tests. High speed drop tower tests were used to define the basic material model parameters. Sled tests with a rigid impactor shape based on SID IIs, dummy pelvis and head impact tests with a Free Motion Head (FMH) form according to FMVSS 201 U were used to validate the models and assess their accuracy with respect to various complexity of foam sample geometry.
