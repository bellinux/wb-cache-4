5|$|Because SI prefixes {{may not be}} {{concatenated}} (serially linked) {{within the}} name or symbol for a <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>measure,</b> SI prefixes are used with the gram, not the kilogram, which already has a prefix {{as part of its}} name.

5|$|The {{introduction}} of the metric system into France in 1795 was done on a district by district basis with Paris being the first district, but by modern standards the transition was poorly managed. Although thousands of pamphlets were distributed, the Agency of Weights and Measures who oversaw the introduction underestimated the work involved. Paris alone needed 500,000 metre sticks, yet {{one month after the}} metre became the sole legal <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>measure,</b> they only had 25,000 in store. This, combined with other excesses of the Revolution and the high level of illiteracy made the metric system unpopular.|$|E
5|$|Raymond {{purchased}} {{land in the}} Nishi Azabu {{district of}} Tokyo to build his new office and living quarters. The office was built using the traditional Japanese post and lintel type construction using unplaned timber logs. The office served as a proving ground for the latest American building innovations including veneered plywood and suspended metal ductwork for forced air heating. Taking influence from Le Corbusier's modulor, Raymond used the traditional Japanese module of the ken (based upon the size of tatami mats) as a <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>measure</b> to set out the building's structure. Again he used fusuma partitions and shoji screens, but in a modern way to divide up the spaces.|$|E

5|$|Spherical coordinates, {{known as}} {{ecliptic}} longitude and latitude or celestial longitude and latitude, {{are used to}} specify positions of bodies on the celestial sphere {{with respect to the}} ecliptic. Longitude is measured positively eastward 0° to 360° along the ecliptic from the vernal equinox, the same direction in which the Sun appears to move. Latitude is measured perpendicular to the ecliptic, to +90° northward or -90° southward to the poles of the ecliptic, the ecliptic itself being 0° latitude. For a complete spherical position, a distance parameter is also necessary. Different distance units are used for different objects. Within the Solar System, astronomical units are used, and for objects near Earth, Earth radii or kilometers are used. A corresponding right-handed rectangular coordinate system is also used occasionally; the x-axis is directed toward the vernal equinox, the y-axis 90° to the east, and the z-axis toward the north ecliptic pole; the astronomical unit is the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>measure.</b> Symbols for ecliptic coordinates are somewhat standardized; see the table.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the NHC {{expanded}} the windspeed range for Category 4 by 1mph in both directions, to 130–156mph, with corresponding {{changes in the}} other units (113–136 kn, 209–251km/h), instead of 131–155mph (114–135 kn, 210–249km/h). The NHC and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center assign tropical cyclone intensities in 5 knot increments, and then convert to mph and km/h with a similar rounding for other reports. So an intensity of 115 knots is rated Category 4, but the conversion to miles per hour (132.3mph) would round down to 130mph, making it {{appear to be a}} Category 3 storm. Likewise, an intensity of 135 knots (~155mph, and thus Category 4) is 250.02km/h, which according to the definition used before the change would be Category 5. To resolve these issues, the NHC had been obliged to incorrectly report storms with wind speeds of 115 kn as 135mph, and 135 kn as 245km/h. The change in definition allows storms of 115 kn to be correctly rounded down to 130mph, and storms of 135 kn to be correctly reported as 250km/h, and still qualify as Category 4. Since the NHC had previously rounded incorrectly to keep storms in Category 4 in each <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>measure,</b> the change does not affect the classification of storms from previous years. The new scale became operational on May 15, 2012.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{architectural}} prominence, {{very little}} is known of the church's history and its precise architecture. Most of {{the information on the}} church's original appearance is derived from the epigram in honour of Juliana and her family, which was inscribed in pieces {{in various parts of the}} church. The epigram claims that the church was laid out as a replica of the ancient Jewish Temple with the precise proportions given in the Bible for the Temple of Solomon, and using the royal cubit as a <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>measure,</b> as in its model. Richard Martin Harrison, the site's chief excavator, has reconstructed the church as a roughly square basilica, ca. 52 m long on the sides, with a central nave and two side aisles, fronted by a narthex and preceded by a large atrium of 26 m length. To the north of the atrium, remains of another building have been identified as either the church's baptistery or Juliana's palace. An oval substructure in the building's center indicates the position of the ambon, while strong foundations throughout the building indicate, according to Harrison, the presence of a dome, bringing the estimated height of the building to over 30 m. The area of the altar was not sufficiently excavated, and its shape remains unknown. The possible presence of a dome, although not universally accepted, is of major importance, since it would mean that it was St. Polyeuctus, and not Justinian's churches (Saints Sergius and Bacchus and the Hagia Sophia), which first combined the traditional basilica with a dome. From the epigram, we know that the interior featured two storeys with colonnades and galleries. Based on the epigram and the substructures, Harrison also posited the existence of a pair of two-storey exedrae, composed of three niches with a pier in between, on the northern and southern sides of the ambo. The spaces around the domed western bay would have been covered with barrel or cross-vaults.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} ninth century, when {{much of what}} later became France {{was part of the}} Holy Roman Empire, units of measure had been {{standardised}} by the Emperor Charlemagne. He had introduced standard units of measure for length and for mass throughout his empire. As the empire disintegrated into separate nations, including France, these standards diverged. It has been estimated that {{on the eve of the}} Revolution, a quarter of a million different units of measure were in use in France; in many cases the quantity associated with each <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>measure</b> differed from town to town, and even from trade to trade. Although certain standards, such as the pied du roi (the King's foot) had a degree of pre-eminence and were used by scientists, many traders chose to use their own measuring devices, giving scope for fraud and hindering commerce and industry. These variations were promoted by local vested interests, but hindered trade and taxation.
