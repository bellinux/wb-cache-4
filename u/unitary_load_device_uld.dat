50|$|A Unit <b>Load</b> <b>Device,</b> or <b>ULD,</b> is a {{container}} used to transport cargo on commercial aircraft.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{commercial}} aircraft suitable for carrying cargo {{such as the}} Boeing 747 and the bigger An&#8209;124, which was purposely built for easy conversion into a cargo aircraft. Such large aircraft employ quick-loading containers known as unit <b>load</b> <b>devices</b> (<b>ULDs),</b> much like containerized cargo ships. The ULDs {{are located in the}} front section of the aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|However, most baggage {{and loose}} freight items are loaded into {{containers}} called Unit <b>Load</b> <b>Devices</b> (<b>ULDs),</b> {{often referred to}} as [...] "cans". ULDs {{come in a variety of}} sizes and shapes, but the most common model is the LD3. This particular container has approximately the same height as the cargo compartment and fits across half of its width.|$|R
25|$|A unit <b>load</b> <b>device</b> (<b>ULD)</b> is a pallet or {{container}} used to load luggage, freight, {{and mail}} on wide-body aircraft and specific narrow-body aircraft. It allows a large quantity of cargo to be bundled {{into a single}} unit. Since this leads to fewer units to load, it saves ground crews time and effort and helps prevent delayed flights. Each ULD has its own packing list (or manifest) so that its contents can be tracked.|$|R

The nose door swings up so that pallets or containers up to 40ft (12 m) can be loaded straight in on motor-driven rollers. An optional main deck side cargo door (like the 747-400M (Combi)) allows loading of dimensionally taller cargo modules. A lower deck ("belly") side door allows loading of unit <b>load</b> <b>devices</b> (<b>ULD)</b> up to 163cm in height.

40|$|The {{real-time}} planning visualisation, precise allocation and loading optimisation in {{air cargo}} load planning operations are increasingly important as more considerations are needed on dangerous cargo loading, locations of lithium batteries, weight declaration and limited aircraft capacity. The planning {{of the unit}} <b>load</b> <b>devices</b> (<b>ULD)</b> can often be carried out only in {{a limited number of}} hours before flight departure. A dynamic air cargo load planning system is proposed with the optimisation of cargo load plan and visualisation of planning results in virtual reality systems. The system aims to optimise the cargo load planning and visualise the simulated loading planning decision on air cargo terminal operations. Adopting simulation tools, Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) and virtual reality technologies, the results of planning with reference to weight and balance, Unit <b>Load</b> <b>Device</b> (<b>ULD)</b> dimensions, gateway, cargo nature and aircraft capacity are optimised and presented. The virtual reality system facilities planning, operations, education and training. Staff in terminals are usually trained in a traditional push-approach demonstration with enormous manual paperwork. With the support of newly customized immersive visualization environment, users can master the complex air cargo load planning techniques in a problem based training with the instant result being immersively visualised. The virtual reality system is developed with three-dimensional (3 D) projectors, screens, workstations, truss system, 3 D glasses, and demonstration platform and software. The content will be focused on the cargo planning and loading operations in an air cargo terminal. The system can assist decision-making process during cargo load planning in the complex operations of air cargo terminal operations. The processes of cargo loading, cargo build-up, security screening, and system monitoring can be further visualised.

40|$|Abstract: The {{aircraft}} loading {{problem is a}} real-world combinatorial optimisation problem highly constrained. Indeed, loading the aircraft so the gross weight {{is less than the}} maximum allowable is not enough. This weight must be distributed to keep the centre of gravity (CG) within specified limits. Moreover, an aircraft has usually several cargo compartments with specific contours and structural limitations such as floor loading, combined load limits and cumulative load limitations. Finally, some shipments are particularly restrictive to transport, like dangerous goods, live animals and perishable goods. This paper is concerned with the incorporation of these latter constraints in a mixed integer linear program for the problem of loading a set of Unit <b>Loading</b> <b>Devices</b> (<b>ULDs)</b> and bulk into an aircraft. Experimental results for real data sets show that the model achieves better balanced solutions in only a few seconds compared to the solution obtained by load masters...|$|R
50|$|Dollies for unit <b>load</b> <b>device</b> (<b>ULD)</b> {{and cargo}} pallets are {{standard}} sized flatbed trolley or platform, with many wheels, roller bars or ball bearings protruding above the top surface for easy {{loading and unloading}} of ULD and cargo pallets respectively. Since ULD/pallet rest on ball bearings, these dollies are equipped with hinge/locks to secure {{the position of the}} ULD/pallet on them during tugging transportation. The aviation industry adopted ULD/pallets to be lightweight containers and supporting platforms respectively, intended to be loaded into aircraft and fly along with their loads, they need to be minimum in weight and thus do not have wheels or strong base structure. Also, the ULD/pallets have stringent dimensional standard following the aircraft cargo bay dimension. Therefore, these dollies are custom designed to complement the ULD/pallet's dimension, hinge/fixture position, weak overall physical strength and transportation need. Advanced dollies for ULD and pallets, such as those used on an airport apron, may have the following specialized facilities.|$|R

The A330 MRTT can also be configured to perform Medical Evacuation (Medevac) missions; up to 130 standard stretchers can be carried. The main deck cargo configuration allows carriage of standard commercial containers and pallets, military, ISO and NATO pallets (including seats) and containers, and military equipment and other large items which are loaded through a cargo door.

40|$|The {{aircraft}} loading {{problem is a}} real-world combinatorial optimisation problem highly constrained. Indeed, loading the aircraft so the gross weight {{is less than the}} maximum allowable is not enough. This weight must be distributed to keep the centre of gravity (CG) within specified limits. Balance control refers to the location of the CG. Both lateral and longitudinal balances are important in order to minimize fuel consumption and to satisfy stability and safety requirements. Moreover, an aircraft has usually several cargo compartments with specific contours and structural limitations such as floor loading, combined load limits and cumulative load limitations. The topic of this talk is the description of a mixed integer linear program for the problem of loading a set of Unit <b>Loading</b> <b>Devices</b> (<b>ULDs)</b> and bulk into an aircraft.

40|$|According to the International Air Transport Association and Air Transport Action Group, 51. 3 {{million metric}} tons of goods were transported by {{airlines}} in 2014. To transport luggage, freight and mail, special containers, called Unit <b>Load</b> <b>Devices</b> (<b>ULD),</b> are used. The method of loading packages into ULDs represents a key element for cargo safety and aircraft weight and balance, {{as well as for}} the economy of airline companies. This thesis aims to solve the problem of packing a set of boxes into containers of various shapes without wasting loading space. The goal is to select the best set of ULDs to pack all the boxes achieving a minimum unused volume. As for all the packing problems, geometric constraints have to be satis ed: items cannot overlap and have to lie entirely within the bins. The richness of this application is to manage additional and common constraints: the bin weight limit, rotations, stability and fragility of the boxes, and weight distribution within a ULD. In practice, this problem is manually solved with no strict guarantee that the constraints are met. First, the problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program. As this problem is NP-hard, it opens the way to heuristics. A second approach makes use of the formulation to apply three matheuristic methods, combining exact approaches and heuristics. Third, a tailored two-phase constructive heuristic is developed for this speci c problem; it aims to nd good initial solutions in short computational times. These approaches contain parameters that have been tuned using the irace parametrisation technique. For the experiments, several instances have been created on the basis of a box data set which stems from a real world case...|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores three {{consolidation}} problems {{derived from}} the daily operations of major international airfreight forwarders. First, we study the freight forwarder's unsplittable shipment planning problem in an airfreight forwarding network where a set of cargo shipments have to be transported to given destinations. We provide mixed integer programming formulations that use piecewise-linear cargo rates and account for volume and weight constraints, flight departure/arrival times, as well as shipment-ready times. After exploring the solution of such models using CPLEX, we devise two solution methodologies to handle large problem sizes. The first is based on Lagrangian relaxation, where the problems decompose into a set of knapsack problems {{and a set of}} network flow problems. The second is a local branching heuristic that combines branching ideas and local search. The two approaches show promising results in providing good quality heuristic solutions within reasonable computational times, for difficult and large shipment consolidation problems. Second, we further explore the freight forwarder's shipment planning problem with a different type of discount structure - the system-wide discount. The forwarder's cost associated with one flight depends not only on the quantity of freight assigned to that flight, but also on the total freight assigned to other flights operated by the same carrier. We propose a multi-commodity flow formulation that takes shipment volume and over-declaration into account, and solve it through a Lagrangian relaxation approach. We also model the "double-discount" scheme that incorporates both the common flight-leg discount (the one used in the unsplittable shipment problem) and the system-wide discount offered by cargo airlines. Finally, we focus on palletized loading using unit <b>loading</b> <b>devices</b> (<b>ULDs)</b> with pivots, which is different from what we assumed in the previous two research problems. In the international air cargo business, shipments are usually consolidated into containers; those are the ULDs. A ULD is charged depending on whether the total weight exceeds a certain threshold, called the pivot weight. Shipments are charged the under-pivot rate up to the pivot weight. Additional weight is charged at the over-pivot rate. This scheme is adopted for safety reasons to avoid the ULD overloading. We propose three solution methodologies for the air-cargo consolidation problem under the pivot-weight (ACPW), namely: an exact solution approach based on branch-and-price, a best fit decreasing loading heuristic, and an extended local branching. We found superior computational performance with a combination of the multi-level variables and a relaxation-induced neighborhood search for local branching...|$|R

Considering the limitations of previous designs, a new true triaxial <b>loading</b> <b>device</b> that provides mixed boundary conditions for a true triaxial apparatus (TTA) is introduced. This <b>loading</b> <b>device</b> consists of four sliding rigid plates and two flexible loading faces. The setup of the <b>loading</b> <b>device</b> together with the whole true triaxial system is described.

A three-dimensional finite element (FE) modelling study is carried out on the stress and strain distribution of a soil specimen subjected to loading from two different <b>loading</b> <b>devices.</b> It is found that stresses and strains of a soil specimen subjected to loading from the new sliding plates are far more uniform than those subjected to loading from nonsliding plates with preset gaps.

For mechanically induced bond rupture, the bond-rupture kinetics may be governed by <b>loading</b> <b>device.</b> However, the role of <b>loading</b> <b>device</b> on the kinetics of mechanical rupture has been rarely received much attention until recently. In this work, we have theoretically and/or computationally studied the effect of loading-device stiffness on the kinetics of mechanical unfolding.
