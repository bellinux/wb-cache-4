5|$|Mary was {{depicted}} by Jacobites as an unfaithful daughter who destroyed her father {{for her own}} and her husband's gain. In {{the early years of}} their reign, she was often seen as completely <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> <b>of</b> her husband, but after she had temporarily governed alone during his absences abroad, she was portrayed as capable and confident. Nahum Tate's A Present for the Ladies (1692) compared her to Queen Elizabeth I. Her modesty and diffidence were praised in works such as A Dialogue Concerning Women (1691) by William Walsh, which compared her to Cincinnatus, the Roman general who took on a great task when called to do so, but then willingly abandoned power.|$|E
5|$|Among Mahler's fellow {{students}} at the Conservatory was the future song composer Hugo Wolf, with whom he formed a close friendship. Wolf was unable {{to submit to the}} strict disciplines of the Conservatory and was expelled. Mahler, while sometimes rebellious, avoided the same fate only by writing a penitent letter to Hellmesberger. He attended occasional lectures by Anton Bruckner and, though never formally his pupil, was influenced by him. On 16 December 1877, he attended the disastrous premiere of Bruckner's Third Symphony, at which the composer was shouted down, and most of the audience walked out. Mahler and other sympathetic students later prepared a piano version of the symphony, which they presented to Bruckner. Along with many music students of his generation, Mahler fell <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> <b>of</b> Richard Wagner, though his chief interest was the sound of the music rather than the staging. It is not known whether he saw any of Wagner's operas during his student years.|$|E
25|$|<b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> <b>of</b> {{liberalization}} {{promoted by}} the new communist leader, Nicolae Ceaușescu, Ivașcu {{became a member of}} the Academy of Social and Political Sciences. In 1969 and 1971, he received the Romanian Writers' Union Prize. From 1971 until his death, Ivașcu directed România Literară, the Writers' Union magazine. According to Manolescu, who was to succeed him there, the move from Contemporanul to România Literară was rather a demotion, signaling that Ceaușescu did not trust him. Others contrarily note that Ceaușescu handpicked Ivașcu to direct the magazine after the fall from favor of a previous editor, Nicolae Breban. Breban had made public his criticism of the July Theses, through which Ceaușescu had reintroduced hardline Marxism-Leninism.|$|E

50|$|The first {{recorded}} Entrikens (or Entrekins) were Samuel and George. George joined the Quakers, renowned record keepers, whereas Samuel did not; {{and he went}} <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>spelling</b> <b>of</b> Entrekin. Electoral documents account for Moses and Elizabeth Entriken in Scotland in 1851, and Entrikens in Kennedy, Australia {{as early as the}} 1930s.

25|$|While {{borrowing}} {{much from}} the preceding Etruscan architecture, {{such as the use}} of hydraulics and the construction of arches, Roman prestige architecture remained firmly <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> <b>of</b> Ancient Greek architecture and the classical orders. This came initially from Magna Graecia, the Greek colonies in southern Italy, and indirectly from Greek influence on the Etruscans, but after the Roman conquest of Greece directly from the best classical and Hellenistic examples in the Greek world. The influence is evident in many ways; for example, in the introduction and use of the Triclinium in Roman villas as a place and manner of dining. Roman builders employed Greeks in many capacities, especially in the great boom in construction in the early Empire.|$|E
25|$|In his old age, {{he seems}} to have come <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> <b>of</b> his {{youngest}} wife Tishyaraksha. It is said that she had got Ashoka's son Kunala, the regent in Takshashila and the heir presumptive to the throne, blinded by a wily stratagem. The official executioners spared Kunala and he became a wandering singer accompanied by his favourite wife Kanchanmala. In Pataliputra, Ashoka heard Kunala's song, and realised that Kunala's misfortune may have been a punishment for some past sin of the emperor himself. He condemned Tishyaraksha to death, restoring Kunala to the court. In the Ashokavadana, Kunala is portrayed as forgiving Tishyaraksha, having obtained enlightenment through Buddhist practice. While he urges Ashoka to forgive her as well, Ashoka does not respond with the same forgiveness. Kunala was succeeded by his son, Samprati, who ruled for 50 years until his death.|$|E
25|$|Henze {{was born}} in Gütersloh, Westphalia, the eldest of six {{children}} of a teacher, and showed early interest in art and music. That and his political views led to conflict with his conservative father. Henze's father, Franz, {{had served in the}} First World War and was wounded at Verdun. He worked as a teacher in a school at Bielefeld, formed on progressive lines, but it was closed in 1933 by government order because its progressive style was out of step with official views. Franz Henze then moved to Dünne, a small village near Bünde, where he fell <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> <b>of</b> Nazi propaganda. Books by Jewish and Christian authors were replaced in the Henze household by literature reflecting Nazi views; the whole family was expected to fall into line with Franz's new thinking. The older boys, including Hans, were enrolled in the Hitler Youth.|$|E

25|$|The new duchess was adored by {{the poor}} and less {{fortunate}} tenants on her husband's estate, whom she visited and to whom she provided assistance. She later became involved with other philanthropic projects and was particularly interested in those that affected mothers and children. She was also a social success with royalty and the aristocracy of Britain. However, given the ill-fitting match between the duke and his wife, {{it was only a}} matter of time before their marriage was in name only. The duchess eventually was smitten by her husband's handsome cousin, the Hon. Reginald Fellowes (the liaison did not last, to the relief of Fellowes's parents), while the duke fell <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> <b>of</b> Gladys Marie Deacon, an eccentric American of little money but, like Consuelo, dazzling to look at and of considerable intellect. The Marlboroughs separated in 1906, divorced in 1921, and the marriage was annulled, at the duke's request and with Consuelo's assent, on 19 August 1926.|$|E
25|$|Deianira feared {{she would}} lose Heracles {{to the younger}} and more {{beautiful}} Iole. Years earlier, the centaur Nessus had ferried her across the river Evenus and attempted to rape her when {{they were on the}} other side. Heracles saved her from Nessus by shooting him with poisoned arrows. She had kept some of Nessus' blood for the centaur told her in his dying breath that if she were to give Heracles a cloak (chiton) soaked in his blood, it would be a love charm. Deianira, being concerned by Heracles' infidelity, believed Nessus’ lie that Heracles would no longer desire any other woman after he was <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> <b>of</b> the love philter. This seemed like the perfect solution to her problem to reclaim her husband's love from him Iole, the foreign concubine. The cloak was delivered to Heracles and when he put it on the poison went into his body. Deianira had unwittingly poisoned her husband with this purported love potion because of her sadness over her husband's unfaithfulness. Upon realizing the mistake she had made, Deianira then killed herself. Because of his love for his concubine Iole, Heracles asked his eldest son, Hyllus to marry her so that she would be well taken care of. Iole and Hyllus had a son called Cleodaeus, and also three daughters, Evaechme, Aristaechme, and Hyllis.|$|E

500|$|Harrison and Boyd {{returned}} to England on 22 October, {{and continued to}} adhere to a Hindu-aligned lifestyle of yoga, meditation and vegetarianism at their home in Esher. The education Harrison received in India, particularly regarding the illusory nature of the material world, resonated following his experiences with the hallucinogenic drug LSD (commonly known as [...] "acid") and informed his lyrics to [...] "Within You Without You". Having considered leaving the Beatles {{after the completion of}} their third US tour, on 29 August 1966, he instead gained a philosophical perspective on the effects of the band's international fame.

500|$|At this juncture, {{in early}} 1943, Robert Oppenheimer was {{establishing}} the Los Alamos Laboratory, a secret laboratory {{on a remote}} mesa in New Mexico where atomic bombs would be designed and built. An offer was made to the Princeton team to be redeployed there. [...] "Like a bunch of professional soldiers," [...] Wilson later recalled, [...] "we signed up, en masse, to go to Los Alamos." [...] Like many other young physicists, Feynman soon fell <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> <b>of</b> the charismatic Oppenheimer, who telephoned Feynman long distance from Chicago to inform {{him that he had}} found a sanatorium in Albuquerque, New Mexico, for Arline.

500|$|While {{the fort}} itself was never {{endangered}} by the British assault, Ticonderoga became a byword for impregnability. Even though the fort was effectively handed to the British by a retreating French army in 1759, future {{defenders of the}} fort and their superior officers, {{who may not have}} been familiar with the site's shortcomings, fell <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> <b>of</b> this idea. In 1777, when General John Burgoyne advanced down Lake Champlain {{at the beginning of the}} Saratoga campaign, General George Washington, who had never seen the fort, thought highly of its defensive value. Anthony Wayne, who was at Fort Ticonderoga preparing its defenses before Burgoyne's arrival, wrote to Washington that the fort [...] "can never be carried, without much loss of blood". Fort Ticonderoga was surrendered by the Americans without much of a fight in July 1777.|$|E

500|$|From 1903 to 1906 Walpole studied {{history at}} Emmanuel College, Cambridge.

As an undergraduate he met and fell <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> <b>of</b> A. C. Benson, formerly a greatly loved master at Eton, and by this time a don at Magdalene College. Walpole's religious beliefs, hitherto an unquestioned part of his life, were fading, and Benson helped him through that personal crisis. Walpole was also attempting to cope with his homosexual feelings, which for a while focused on Benson, who recorded in his diary in 1906 an unexpected outburst by his young admirer: [...] "e broke out rather eagerly into protestations – He cared for me more {{than anyone in the}} world. I could not believe it... It is extraordinarily touching.... It is quite right that he should believe all this passionately; it is quite right that I should know that it will not last... I tried to say this as tenderly as I could..." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} Heseltine began {{composing}} seriously, around 1915–16, {{he had started}} {{to shake off the}} overwhelming influence of Delius. He had discovered English folk-song in 1913, his Oxford year, and had begun to study Elizabethan and Jacobean music. In 1916 he came <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> <b>of</b> van Dieren, whose influence soon exceeded that of Delius and led to a significant development in compositional technique, first evident in the Saudades song cycle of 1916–17. Gray writes that from Van Dieren, Heseltine [...] "learned to purify and organise his harmonic texture ... and the thick, muddy chords which characterised the early songs gave place to clear and vigorous part-writing". [...] "In 1917–18 Heseltine's passion for Celtic culture, stimulated by his stay in Ireland, brought a new element to his music, and in 1921 he discovered Bartók. A late passion was the music of John Dowland, the Elizabethan lutenist, one of whose dances he arranged for brass band. These constituent parts contributed to the individual style of [...] Heseltine's music. Gray summarised this style thus; ...|$|E

She demands a bed in the nursery despite her husband's warning that it is likely the center of the disturbances. That night the group experiences loud banging and an unseen force attempting to force its way through the living room in which they are staying. [...] The banging then proceeds to move its way up towards the nursery, where the sounds of it destroying the room are heard. This prompts Eleanor to run towards the source; however, Grace is nowhere to be found. Her disappearance is then confirmed the following [...] morning. Eleanor's mental instability worsens as she falls further <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> <b>of</b> Hill House. She enters the library and climbs the dilapidated spiral staircase. Once she reaches the top, Grace appears unexpectedly at a trap door and the startled Eleanor nearly falls to her death. Markway rescues Eleanor but just misses seeing Grace, who has disappeared back into the house.|$|E

When Húrin resisted, Morgoth cursed him along with his kin, took him to Haudh-en-Ndengin and placed him high on the peaks of Thangorodrim, either chained or magically immobilized in a seat. Through the power of Morgoth, he could see and hear from the seat all the evils that later befell his son Túrin and daughter Nienor, who was born {{while he was a}} captive. But he saw only those things that Morgoth wished to reveal, lessening their good deeds and casting shadow on the counsels of Thingol and the Haladin. Húrin was thus embittered even more by the way his children, both <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>spells</b> <b>of</b> Glaurung, came to get married to each other, conceive a child and later commit suicide.|$|R

500|$|The {{episode is}} one of the few in the series that has no paranormal {{elements}} to it. Carter said of the episode's conception, [...] "My first chance to work with David Nutter in a long time, and I wanted to give him something he could sink his teeth into. It's a little bit different for us. It doesn't really have a paranormal aspect, except for Scully's perceptions of her deepest fears. I felt that I had to figure out what she is most afraid of, and she is most afraid of those things that most of us are afraid of. [...] The idea of dying at the hands of someone—creature or not—and she is helpless to do anything about it. I thought it was a very good way to explore Scully's character." [...] The scene where Dana Scully imagines Pfaster appearing as a devil was influenced by real-life accounts, as described by Carter: [...] "There are reports of people who had been <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> <b>of</b> Jeffrey Dahmer, who actually claimed that he shape-shifted during those hours when they were held hostage; that his image actually changed." [...] Nutter said [...] "In many ways, Chris wanted to sell the idea that, as established in Mulder's closing dialogue in the show, not all terror comes from the paranormal. It could come from the person next door." ...|$|E
500|$|Duality {{is another}} common theme in Caligari. Dr. Caligari is {{portrayed in the}} main {{narrative}} as an insane tyrant, and in the frame story as a respected authority and director of a mental institution. As {{a result of this}} duality, the viewer cannot help but suspect a malevolent aspect of him {{at the conclusion of the}} film, even despite all evidence indicating he is a kind and caring man. Even within the main narrative alone, Dr. Caligari lives a double life: holding a respectable position as the asylum director, but becoming a hypnotist and murderer at night. Additionally, the character is actually a double of the [...] "real" [...] Caligari, an 18th-century mystic whom the film character becomes so obsessed with that he desires to penetrate his innermost secrets and [...] "become Caligari". Francis also takes on a double life of sorts, serving as the heroic protagonist in the main narrative and a patient in a mental institution in the frame story. Anton Kaes described the story Francis tells as an act of transference with his psychiatrist, as well as a projection of his feelings that he is a victim <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> <b>of</b> the all-powerful asylum director, just as Cesare is the hypnotized victim of Dr. Caligari. The Cesare character serves as both a persecutor and a victim, as he is both a murderer and the unwilling slave of an oppressive master.|$|E
500|$|After the queen's death, Sophia {{lived in}} Kensington Palace during her final years, {{next to her}} niece Princess Victoria of Kent, the future Queen Victoria. As a result, Princess Sophia {{was one of the}} few {{paternal}} relatives that Victoria saw often. Like her sister-in-law the Duchess of Kent, Sophia fell <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> <b>of</b> Victoria's comptroller Sir John Conroy and let him manage her money. The princess became a part of the Duchess of Kent's social circle and, in return, Sophia spied for Conroy when he was absent from Kensington Palace. Sophia also reported to Conroy on what she heard at St. James's Palace, as she had privileged access to courtiers as well as to her two elder brothers. Gossipmongers speculated that Conroy's successful ability to deal with the [...] "bullying inopportunities" [...] of Sophia's illegitimate son endeared her to him, [...] while some historians write that Conroy took advantage of Sophia, who in her last years had become [...] "dizzy, easily muddled... mourning her fading looks" [...] and a [...] "confused, nearly blind aunt." [...] Sophia often dined with the household, but the Duchess of Kent despised her. Princess Victoria was aware her aunt was a spy and the two never became close. Sophia's wealth allowed Conroy to live a rich lifestyle, acquiring for himself a house in Kensington for £4000, as well as two other estates for £18,000. Sophia was also responsible for certain members of Victoria's household gaining higher statuses; Victoria's governess Louise Lehzen, for instance, was made a Hanoverian baroness on the orders of George IV, and Conroy was named a Knight Commander of the Hanoverian Order.|$|E
