5|$|Carl Linnaeus, {{the founder}} of modern {{binomial}} nomenclature, gave lemurs their name as early as 1758, when he <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the 10th edition of Systema Naturae. He included three species under the genus Lemur: Lemur tardigradus (the red slender loris, now known as Loris tardigradus), Lemur catta (the ring-tailed lemur), and Lemur volans (the Philippine colugo, now known as Cynocephalus volans).|$|E
5|$|Cumings, and {{simultaneously}} the New Zealand neurologist Derek Denny-Brown, {{working in the}} United States, first reported effective treatment with metal chelator British anti-Lewisite in 1951. This treatment had to be injected but {{was one of the}} first therapies available in the field of neurology, a field that classically was able to observe and diagnose but had few treatments to offer. The first effective oral chelation agent, penicillamine, was discovered in 1956 by British neurologist John Walshe. In 1982, Walshe also introduced trientine, and was the first to develop tetrathiomolybdate for clinical use. Zinc acetate therapy initially made its appearance in the Netherlands, where physicians Schouwink and Hoogenraad <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> 1961 and in the 1970s, respectively, but it was further developed later by Brewer and colleagues at the University of Michigan.|$|E
5|$|In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, {{also known}} as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, {{is one of the}} {{simplest}} and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> his private correspondence.|$|E

5|$|Many doctors {{considered}} {{the case to}} be unusual and debated the cause of death. Some, including family members, accused them of criminal negligence; that Shepard was fed well before the operation, which could have allowed him to choke on vomit. No autopsy was made, but an inquest {{was made by the}} coroner. The two doctors to perform the operation made a statement on March 28, 1893 that after prior examinations no diseases were found and his heart and lungs seemed healthy. A Tribune reporter met doctor William J. Morton, son of possible ether discoverer William T. G. Morton who had first <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> 1846. Morton said it was most improbable Shepard died of ether, ensuring its safety when properly used, and that deaths were one in 25,000. He recommended an autopsy.|$|E

In 2016, WSDOT calculated that 40,000 vehicles used SR202 at its western terminus in Woodinville and 7,500 vehicles <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Woodinville wine country, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively. The entire highway is also designated as the Cascade Valleys Scenic Byway, a state scenic and recreational highway and heritage corridor.|$|E
5|$|Though {{they were}} {{documented}} by droppings and tracks, {{pictures of the}} Bornean rhinoceros were first taken and widely distributed by modern conservationists in April 2006, when camera traps photographed a healthy adult in the jungles of Sabah in Malaysian Borneo. On 24 April 2007, {{it was announced that}} cameras had captured the first-ever video footage of a wild Bornean rhino. The night-time footage showed the rhino eating, peering through jungle foliage, and sniffing the film equipment. The World Wildlife Fund, which took the video, has <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> efforts to convince local governments to turn the area into a rhino conservation zone. Monitoring has continued; 50 new cameras have been set up, and in February 2010, {{what appeared to be a}} pregnant rhino was filmed.|$|E

5|$|Bonstelle {{sold her}} {{stake in the}} Garrick Theater in 1924. She and her company founded the Bonstelle Playhouse in Detroit, which opened on January 1, 1925. Backed by a {{syndicate}} led by a patron of hers, she bought a former synagogue on Woodward Avenue, Temple Beth El, for $500,000 and commissioned C. Howard Crane to renovate it. At first she carried on producing mostly Broadway-style plays. However, the company did perform classics, including modern-dress productions of Romeo and Juliet in 1926 and Hamlet in 1927, {{among the first to}} put on such performances. In February 1928 Bonstelle began a campaign to gain community support for the theater. A fund of over $200,000 was raised by donations from the public and Bonstelle made an agreement with local authorities to make the playhouse the city's unofficial premier theater. Later that year the group became known as the Detroit Civic Theater. In her plan for the theater she emphasized the importance of providing the public with the best drama, including both classics and modern works, and improving young people's knowledge of dramatic literature. Funded by public subscription, it had ticket prices as low as $1.50. Performances included works by Shakespeare, Henrik Ibsen and Richard Brinsley Sheridan. The theater also played a religious role. Bonstelle <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> an effort to improve understanding and co-operation between the church and the theater, holding multi-denominational religious services there during Lent, and she stated that her plays, while avoiding being preachy, were intended to have a positive moral influence on the audience. Local clergy publicly praised her work with the theater.|$|E
5|$|Okada {{described}} the main theme as power achieved through intelligence and overcoming the environments. The main narrative featured multiple references to Chinese mythology, {{while many of}} the player characters drew from historical and literary figures from each country the game visited. The Hakke leaders of the Sangokai were designed around a particular part of their body being malformed. A narrative element carried over from the Megami Tensei franchise was a system of choices based on morality that influenced the ending; while these elements had been thoroughly explored in Megami Tensei, the team felt the themes still had potential and so <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Maken X. The game was Atlus' first title to feature full voice acting; the team initially planned to voice event scenes in English and Chinese with Japanese subtitles, but included voice acting across the whole game due to positive feedback. A similar set of circumstances led to the wide use of stereophonic sound across the whole game when it was initially planned only for action sequences.|$|E
5|$|Siglas Poveiras are {{a form of}} proto-writing system, with a {{restricted}} number of symbols that were combined to form more complex symbols; these were used as a rudimentary visual communication system, and as a signature to mark belongings. Merchants wrote them in their books of credit; fishermen <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> religious rituals by marking them {{in the door of}} Catholic chapels near hills or beaches; in the table of the church during marriage and in their tombstone; and also had magical significance, such as the São Selimão sigla, that {{could be used as a}} protecting symbol and not as family mark. Children used the same family mark with piques as a form of cadency. The youngest son would not have any pique and would inherit his father's symbol. The siglas are still used, though much less commonly, by some families; and are related with Viking traditions.|$|E

5|$|The Magic Wand {{has found}} great {{commercial}} {{success as a}} vibrator, a masturbation aid for women. Its popularity for this purpose {{is associated with the}} American artist and sex educator Betty Dodson, who <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> demonstrations and instructional classes to instruct women regarding self-pleasure techniques. Dodson became active in the sex-positive movement in the late 1960s. She recommended women put a small towel over their sex organs in order to dull the sensation of the vibrator and prolong the pleasurable experience. Her technique became known as the Betty Dodson Method. Her sessions were known as Bodysex workshops and featured 15 naked women in supine position, each using a Magic Wand simultaneously to aid in masturbation. She provided a Magic Wand to each woman for these two-hour masturbation sessions. Dodson taught thousands of women to achieve orgasm using this technique.|$|E
5|$|There {{were some}} {{similarities}} between Ernő and Auric: both were Jewish immigrants {{who came to}} Britain from Eastern Europe in the 1930s and both were Marxists, although they were physically very different. The likely model for Goldfinger was American gold tycoon Charles W. Engelhard, Jr., who Fleming had met in 1949. Englehard had established a company, the Precious Metals Development Company, which circumvented numerous export restrictions, selling gold ingots directly into Hong Kong. Fleming had reinforced his knowledge of gold by sending a questionnaire to an expert at the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, one of the Livery Companies of the City of London {{with a list of}} queries about gold, its properties and the background of the industry, including smuggling. Fleming himself liked gold enough to commission a gold-plated typewriter from the Royal Typewriter Company, although he never actually <b>used</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> 1995, this machine was purchased by the Bond actor, Pierce Brosnan.|$|E
5|$|Though he {{secretly}} {{played a}} game for Rothwell Town in 1988, he played amateur football {{for the first time}} since childhood with pub side New Wheel in 2000, and broke his nose in a game for the club. He gained his A-licence, which allowed him to coach in the professional game, and he took up coaching at Ossett Town. He and John Beresford then set up an unsuccessful wooden flooring company called 'Major Oaks'. The pair then developed a football training product called 'BallMax', Alex Ferguson <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the Manchester United Academy, but this business also went nowhere. Billy Jennings then took the pair on as football agents at Premier Management International for a twelve-month period. Northampton Town manager Martin Wilkinson then took Swan on as a coach, but soon after Colin Calderwood took over as manager in 2003 Swan found himself again out of work. Swan instead found success in the building trade, constructing a house in his expansive back garden. He also found work as an 'expert witness' for Hull City's games at BBC Radio Humberside in 2003. The next year he also began working as a pundit for the Hull Daily Mail, and did occasional work for BBC Look North.|$|E

5|$|Traction trebuchet: The {{earliest}} type of trebuchet catapult was the traction trebuchet, developed {{first in}} China by the 5th or 4th century BC, {{the beginning of}} the Warring States period (403–221 BC); to operate the trebuchet, a team of men pulled on ropes attached to the butt of the shorter segment of a long wooden beam separated by a rotating axle fixed to a base framework, allowing the longer segment of the beam to lunge forward and use its sling to hurl a missile; by the 9th century a hybrid of the traction and counterweight trebuchet, employing manpower and a pivoting weight, was used in the Middle East, Mediterranean Basin, and Northern Europe; by the 12th century, the full-fledged counterweight trebuchet was developed under the Ayyubid dynasty of Islamic Syria and Egypt (described by Mardi bin Ali al-Tarsusi) and used in the Third Crusade; by the 13th century, the counterweight trebuchet found its way into Song Dynasty (960–1279) China via the Mongol invaders under Kublai Khan (r. 1260–1294) who <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the Siege of Xiangyang (1267–1273).|$|E
