Between Sean Connery giving his notice at the {{beginning}} of filming You Only Live Twice and its release, Saltzman had planned to adapt The Man with the Golden Gun in Cambodia and use Roger Moore as the next Bond, but political instability meant the location was ruled out and Moore signed <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> series of the television programme The Saint. After You Only Live Twice was released in 1967, the producers once again picked the often-delayed On Her Majesty's Secret Service, which had previously been considered to follow both Goldfinger and then Thunderball.|$|E

25|$|Airport {{proposals}} were defeated in two hotly contested ballot initiatives, and further challenges {{took place in}} the courts. A series of demonstration commercial flights from the airport in June 1999 generated less noise than the former military flights, but resulted in much public outcry due to the use of different flight paths from the military, and incessant circling over nearby cities to line <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> approach. Eventually the airport opponents prevailed, and in March 2002, the Department of Defense announced that it would sell the land to private interests to be developed into Orange County Great Park. This decision came right after the military stated that it wanted to return to the base.|$|E

500|$|... "Requiem" [...] {{was a story}} {{milestone}} for the series, {{featuring the}} alien abduction of Mulder. Mulder would appear sporadically {{in the last two}} seasons, only returning for about half of the episodes in season eight and only two episodes in season nine. Prior to being picked <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> season, however, many believed that the episode would serve as the series finale. As such, many elements from the show's pilot episode were brought in to bring the show closure and help it segue into a movie franchise.|$|E
500|$|The season saw {{drastic changes}} to the series' alien mythology. In the premiere episode, [...] "Herrenvolk", Williams—the actor who played Mulder's {{informant}} X—was written out of the show. He said that, [...] "Carter called me up personally [...] 'Got good news, got bad news. The good news is we're gonna bring you <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> episode this week. The bad news is you're gonna take a bullet." [...] The writers created a new character, Marita Covarrubias, to function as Mulder's informant. Carter felt it would be [...] "more interesting for Mulder's next contact to be a woman", noting that he [...] "wanted there to be some suspicion about whether Mulder would become involved with her romantically. [...] "Herrenvolk" [...] also introduced the killer bees, who {{would go on to}} play a larger part in the 1998 film. Carter described the fourth season as [...] "maybe the most intense and difficult season of the show." ...|$|E

Many fans denounced Gateworld's cancellation announcement, both the timing of it (apparently it had been made while the cast and crew were celebrating the episode's airing)—and the decision itself, on the ground that, while ratings were not as high as they had been in previous seasons, the series was still drawing an audience of a respectable size. (For example, it had a season average of 2million viewers in Australia, half of them in the 18–49 demographic.)

500|$|The album marked Shankar's first {{collaboration}} with Harris Jayaraj; all his previous directorial ventures had A. R. Rahman composing the music. As Rahman {{was busy with}} his debut Broadway musical Bombay Dreams and had also signed <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> musical Lord of the Rings, Rahman and Shankar decided to part ways. In early 2004, Harris Jayaraj went {{on a trip to}} Phuket Islands in Thailand for some inspiration for the album; he was accompanied by Shankar and Vairamuthu. Eventually, the three songs penned by the lyricist were composed in the island. The visit took place much before the tragic 2004 tsunami struck the countries bordering the Indian Ocean and wreaked havoc. In a chat with Shankar, Harris Jayaraj said [...] "the music was a challenge because the film was a mix of genres– action, comedy, thriller. In essence, it was a cock-mocktail [...]." [...] Harris Jayaraj commenced the film's re-recording in April 2005 and took more than a month to complete, delaying the film's release.|$|E

The Jayhawks were only able to score two points after Rosenbluth's disqualification. North Carolina then began to rally after scoring a basket and then an accompanying free throw. Bob Young — who had replaced Rosenbluth after his fifth foul [...] scored a layup to bring Carolina within two points. Carolina tied the game at 4646 after Tommy Kearns made a free throw in the closing seconds. The Tar Heels got the ball back and held it for one final possession. The ball was passed to Bob Cunningham who missed his initial shot, but was able to get the rebound. Cunningham went <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> shot, but received heavy contact from Chamberlain. No foul was called and the time ran out, sending the game to overtime.|$|E
