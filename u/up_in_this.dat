5|$|All {{of these}} factors have led to wide {{speculation}} {{that most of the}} 3.5million unsold copies of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial ultimately wound <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> landfill, crushed and encased in concrete. It has also been reported that prototypes for the proposed Atari Mindlink controller system were disposed of at the site, which only further fuels speculation, since Atari Museum owner Curt Vendel actually currently owns the Mindlink prototypes. Writing for the Pacific Historical Review, John Wills speculated that location's place in the public psyche—its proximity to the sites of both the Trinity nuclear test and Roswell UFO incident—has aided the popularity of the story.|$|E
5|$|During the Second Great Awakening, {{the region}} was a hotbed of {{religious}} enthusiasm. Between 1817 and 1825, there were several camp meetings and revivals in the Palmyra area. Although Smith's parents disagreed about religion, the family was caught <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> excitement. Smith later said he became interested in religion by {{about the age of}} twelve. As a teenager, he may have been sympathetic to Methodism. With other family members, Smith also engaged in religious folk magic, which was a relatively common practice in that time and place. Both his parents and his maternal grandfather reportedly had visions or dreams that they believed communicated messages from God. Smith said that, although he had become concerned about the welfare of his soul, he was confused by the claims of competing religious denominations.|$|E

5|$|Following {{this the}} 27th Battalion {{returned}} to Egypt, where the AIF undertook {{a period of}} training and re-organisation as reinforcements arrived from Australia. During this time the AIF was expanded from two infantry divisions to four– with a fifth forming in Australia– and many infantry battalions that had seen service at Gallipoli were split up to provide cadre staff for the newly raised battalions. The battalions of the 2nd Division, however, were not split <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> manner and the 27th Battalion remained intact.|$|E
5|$|In early January 1943, Lieutenant Colonel Derek Mills-Roberts {{arrived from}} the United Kingdom {{to take over the}} unit, and he was in command when on 26 February 1943 they were {{involved}} in bitter fighting against two battalions of German parachute infantry with armoured support which attacked their position as part of an attempt to encircle the 1st Army by cutting the Medjez road. In a fight that lasted over five hours, against an enemy that outnumbered them and had the advantage of heavy armoured support, the commandos, along with elements from the Reconnaissance Regiment, were able to stop the advance long enough for reinforcements to be brought <b>up.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> action, No. 6 Commando incurred 11 killed, 34 wounded and 55 missing in action. This represented over 40 per cent of the unit's strength at the time, although later a number of those that were captured were recovered after the Germans withdrew.|$|E
5|$|Wellingborough's {{population}} expanded rapidly from 26,000 to 60,000 in the 1960s and 1970s as agreements {{were signed}} between the Urban District Council and London County Council and the Greater London Council {{for the town}} to re-house over-spill population from London. Following the post World War II arrival of immigrants from the Commonwealth group of nations into Britain, a sizeable Black Caribbean and Indian/Pakistani community grew <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> small market town, and now represents 7% {{of the population in}} the Borough and to 11% within the town.|$|E

25|$|The {{nature of}} the {{relationship}} between the Cyclic epics and Homer is also bound <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> question. As told by Proclus, the plots of the six non-Homeric epics look very much as though they are designed to integrate with Homer, with no overlaps with one another.|$|E

25|$|According to Jim Allan in An Introduction to Elvish, the Númenórean Calendar {{is similar}} to the French Republican Calendar. For example, the names of the third month of Winter, Súlímë and Ventôse, both mean 'Windy'. When lined <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> way, most of the month names have {{matching}} or similar meanings.|$|E
25|$|The {{onset of}} the Great Depression in 1929–1930 {{substantially}} reduced international trade, and many mercantile vessels were laid <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> period {{due to lack of}} work. There is no record in readily available sources of Edentons movements in the later 1930s, which indicates that she may have been one of those ships laid up.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} granted land patents in rectangular {{blocks of}} eighty acres (320,000m2), {{with the most}} desirable lands along the coastline and inland waterways. By 1708, the entire island had been divided <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> fashion, creating 166 small farms and two large manorial estates, the Dongan estate and a 1600-acre (6.5km2) parcel on the southwestern tip of the island belonging to Christopher Billop (Jackson, 1995).|$|E

25|$|To sum <b>up,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> species {{predation}} by birds {{appears to}} be the main (but not the only) selective force driving the polymorphism. The snails live on heterogeneous backgrounds, and thrush are adept at detecting poor matches. The inheritance of physiological and cryptic diversity is preserved also by heterozygous advantage in the super-gene. Recent work has included the effect of shell colour on thermoregulation, and a wider selection of possible genetic influences is considered by Cook.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{arch-gravity dam}} was the Kasserine Dam in Tunisia, arguably the biggest Roman dam in North Africa with 150m length by 10m height by 7.3m width. However, despite its curved nature, it is {{uncertain}} whether the 2ndcenturyAD dam structurally acted by arching action and not solely by its sheer weight; {{in this case it}} would be classified as a gravity dam and considerably smaller structures in Turkey or the Spanish Puy Foradado Dam would move <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> category (see sortable List of Roman dams).|$|E
25|$|Named after Tony Maloney, {{a long-time}} Luna Park employee, Maloney's Corner {{was built on}} land {{purchased}} from the New South Wales government and the State Rail Authority during the 1994 development, so that supports for the Big Dipper could be built. During the 2003 redevelopment, this area was paved over and the Kids Rides, Ranger, and Spider were relocated here from the Midway, to provide room for other developments. In addition, temporary rides hired by Luna Park for use during peak periods (such as school holidays) are set <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> area.|$|E
