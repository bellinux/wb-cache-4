5|$|Although President Jimmy Carter {{tried to}} place another {{limit on the}} arms race with a SALT II {{agreement}} in 1979, his efforts were <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> the other events that year, including the Iranian Revolution and the Nicaraguan Revolution, which both ousted pro-US regimes, and his retaliation against Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in December.|$|E
5|$|He {{spent his}} {{remaining}} {{years trying to}} recover his health which was severely <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> prison confinement. In late 1926, he was admitted to Lindlahr Sanitarium in Elmhurst, Illinois. He died there of heart failure on October 20, 1926, {{at the age of}} 70. His body was cremated and buried in Highland Lawn Cemetery in Terre Haute, Indiana.|$|E
50|$|Cato is an {{opponent}} of campaign finance reform, arguing that government is the ultimate form of potential corruption and that such laws <b>undermine</b> democracy <b>by</b> <b>undermining</b> competitive elections. Cato also supports {{the repeal of the}} Federal Election Campaign Act.|$|R

5|$|In April, Austrian forces {{approached}} Mantua {{and started}} their siege. At first, the Austrians were content to simply blockade the fortress, {{but with the}} artillery duels and occasional skirmishes, attrition began taking its toll on the defenders. The defenders were also weakened by diminishing food supplies, and their morale was <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> lack of payment.|$|E
5|$|Little else {{is known}} about his childhood, {{although}} there is a persistent tradition that he was educated by his maternal great-grandfather Jean de St. Rémy — a tradition which is somewhat <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> the fact that the latter disappears from the historical record after 1504, when the child was only one year old.|$|E
5|$|The DRFLA was <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> its {{links with}} the Iraqi {{government}} after it emerged that Iraq had sponsored the training and equipping of the hostage-takers. The Iran–Iraq War started {{five months after the}} end of the siege and continued for eight years. The campaign for autonomy of Khūzestān was largely forgotten in the wake of the hostilities, as was the DRFLA.|$|E

5|$|City College's Tudor and Gothic-style building, {{designed}} by Baltimore City Hall architect George A Frederick, lasted until 1892, {{when it was}} <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> {{the construction of the}} Baltimore & Ohio Railroad tunnel from Camden Station to Mount Royal Station, and collapsed. Several years of political in-fighting and the change to a reformist city administration delayed construction of a new structure. Designed by the architects Baldwin and Pennington, the new structure was not completed until 1899.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, the Argentine austral {{replaced}} the discredited peso. In 1986, Argentina {{failed to pay}} the debt for several months, and the debt was renegotiated with the creditor banks. In 1986 and 1987, the Austral Plan faded away, as ﬁscal policy was <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> large off-budget spending and a loose monetary policy, again falling out of compliance with an IMF programme. A new IMF arrangement was reached in July 1987, only to collapse in March 1988.|$|E
5|$|Repairs {{were made}} to the castle between 1610 and 1611 by the captain, Sir George Bampfield, at a cost of £211. A survey in 1623 carried out by Sir Richard Morryson showed the castle to be {{equipped}} with ten iron guns – one culverin, five demi-culverins, two sakers, a minion and a falcon – and garrisoned by its captain, five gunners and three soldiers. It was in a poor condition, and one corner of the gun platform had been <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> the sea; Morryson's team estimated the likely costs of repairs to amount to £459.|$|E

2500|$|There {{were ten}} freshets on the Yamhill river from November 1900 to April 1901. [...] The river banks {{next to the}} lock and dam {{turned out to be}} much less stable then had been planned for, and the river {{conditions}} much worse than anticipated. [...] After a December freshet, a [...] long portion of a riprap protected section fell into the river, and the dam was being threatened with <b>undermining</b> <b>by</b> scour. [...] This was counteracted by depositing [...] of rock in front of the dam and {{at the foot of the}} slope.|$|R
5|$|Rowlands {{argues that}} {{the problem with the}} book's central {{approach}} is that it assumes that all interests have a clear relation to welfare and thus moral considerability; an assumption which, he argues, is partially <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> the introduction of biological interests. Jon Jensen, who reviewed the book for Ethics and the Environment, raised a similar worry, arguing that Varner did not sufficiently justify his claim that biological interests are inherently morally significant.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} pipeline transport – {{responsible for a}} high percentage of oil and natural gas transportation – is often <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> the general public {{due to the lack of}} visibility of this mode. Generally held to be safer and more economical and reliable than the other modes of transport, this mode has many advantages over rival modes, such as trucks and railways. Examples of modern pipeline transport include Alashankou-Dushanzi Crude Oil Pipeline and Iran-Armenia Natural Gas Pipeline. International pipeline transport projects, like the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, presently connect modern nation states– in this case, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey– through pipeline networks.|$|E
5|$|According to Domhoff, {{many people}} {{seem to believe that}} the United States is ruled from behind the scenes by a conspiratorial elite with secret desires, i.e., by a small secretive group that wants to change the {{government}} system or put the country under the control of a world government. In the past the conspirators were usually said to be crypto-communists who were intent upon bringing the United States under a common world government with the Soviet Union, but the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 undercut that theory. Domhoff notes that most conspiracy theorists changed their focus to the United Nations as the likely controlling force in a New World Order, an idea which is <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> the powerlessness of the U.N. and the unwillingness of even moderates within the American Establishment to give it anything but a limited role.|$|E
500|$|The {{base of the}} {{gatehouse}} is defended from <b>undermining</b> <b>by</b> large [...] "spurs". This {{design feature}} is characteristic of castles in the Welsh Marches, including Goodrich and Tonbridge Castle, but unlike these castles depends on a solid octagonal, rather than square, based interacting with {{the form of the}} circular towers. The gatehouse is well defended, except for the upper windows at the rear; the upper floors were designed for high status guests and these windows would have provided adequate light for the chambers. The south-east of the gatehouse is relatively modern, however, having been rebuilt after a past collapse.|$|R
5000|$|The {{battle was}} not {{confined}} to the two investigations and the columns of the Journal. Rathom and Rooseevelt had what the New York Times characterized as a [...] "tart exchange of telegrams" [...] over the issue of who in Washington authorized the improper methods used at Newport. Roosevelt said Rathom's [...] "attack on the navy was disingenuous and dishonorable." [...] Rathom asserted his sole interest was [...] "the protection of the honor of the United States Navy, which officials of the navy have sought to <b>undermine</b> <b>by</b> the most bestial and dishonorable methods known to man." ...|$|R

5|$|Coastal erosion {{remained}} a problem. By {{the middle of}} the century, the tides had reached the southern edge of the castle, and a 1866 report stated that the walls had been <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> the sea. Despite protective piles being driven around the castle, it was badly affected by flooding in 1875 and 1878, creating serious fissures in the stonework. The high costs of maintaining the property, combined with its dwindling utility, encouraged the government to sell the castle to the South Eastern Railway company in 1888, who intended {{to turn it into a}} railway station. It was then sold to private owners and a small museum was created in the castle, which was sometimes opened to the public for an entry price of one penny.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{suggested}} that sustained Keynesian policies {{could lead to}} both unemployment and inflation rising at once – a phenomenon that soon became known as stagflation. In the early 1970s stagflation appeared in both the US and Britain just as Friedman had predicted, with economic conditions deteriorating further after the 1973 oil crisis. Aided by the prestige gained from his successful forecast, Friedman led increasingly successful criticisms against the Keynesian consensus, convincing not only academics and politicians but also much {{of the general public}} with his radio and television broadcasts. The academic credibility of Keynesian economics was further <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> additional criticism from other monetarists trained in the Chicago school of economics, by the Lucas critique and by criticisms from Hayek's Austrian School. So successful were these criticisms that by 1980 Robert Lucas claimed economists would often take offence if described as Keynesians.|$|E
5|$|On 14 May the Germans had {{occupied}} {{almost all of}} North Brabant. SS-Standarte Deutschland, quickly advancing to the Western Scheldt, reached the Bath Position. This cut off the retreat of 27e Groupe de Reconnaissance de Division d'Infanterie, which was subsequently destroyed defending Bergen-op-Zoom. The morale of the defenders of the Bath Position, already shaken by stories from Dutch troops fleeing to the west, was severely <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> the news that Winkelman had surrendered; many concluded that it was useless for Zealand to continue resisting as the last remaining province. A first preparatory artillery bombardment on the position in the evening of 14 May caused the commanding officers to desert their troops, who then also fled.|$|E

50|$|Bagrat's {{death in}} 1478 {{provided}} Vameq {{with the opportunity}} to avenge his humiliation <b>by</b> <b>undermining</b> an attempt <b>by</b> the late king's son, Alexander, to seize the crown and aiding the rival monarch, Constantine II of Kartli, in taking hold of Imereti in 1479. Vameq died in 1482 and was succeeded by his grandnephew, Liparit II Dadiani.|$|R
5|$|St. Mary's Church is a Grade I listed Anglican {{church in}} Chesham, Buckinghamshire, and {{is part of}} the Diocese of Oxford. Built on the site of a Bronze Age stone circle of puddingstones, parts of the church {{building}} date to the 12th century. Remodelled in the 15th and 17th centuries, the church is architecturally a mixture of English Gothic styles. Weakened by additions to the church tower and <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> burials in and around the church, by the 19th century the building was structurally unsound. The church was remodelled and strengthened in the 1860s by George Gilbert Scott and again in the 20th century by Robert Potter.|$|E
5|$|The Maryland State Highway Administration {{plans to}} rebuild the portion of MD 24 that passes through Rocks State Park, which has been <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> the {{adjacent}} Deer Creek. The project was originally proposed in late 2009 and initially called for the route to be relocated further from the creek. The project was put on hold due to opposition from area residents and environmentalists. The Maryland State Highway Administration later proposed reconstructing the road along its current alignment while stabilizing the creek. Work on this project, which is projected to cost $13.3 million, is expected to start as soon as May 2014 and will require closing the road.|$|E
5|$|The Missing Link {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Destructoid's Maurice Tan enjoyed the story despite it not adding {{anything to the}} overall experience of Human Revolution and noted that the major choices lacked impact. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer found no strong narrative hook, feeling it existed more to plug the main game's narrative gap. GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd praised the story for its emotive moments and strong voice acting. Official Xbox Magazines Edwin Evans-Thirlwell found the plot <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> the villain and some poor dialogue. Tom Francis of PC Gamer, while giving minimal comment on the story as a whole, noted {{that it had a}} strong conclusion.|$|E

60|$|Mr Moffat {{did not do}} much towards {{improving}} the conviviality of the castle. He was, of course, a good deal intent upon his coming election, and {{spent much of his}} time with Mr Nearthewinde, the celebrated parliamentary agent. It behoved him to be a good deal at Barchester, canvassing the electors and <b>undermining,</b> <b>by</b> Mr Nearthewinde's aid, the mines for blowing him out of his seat, which were daily being contrived by Mr Closerstil, on behalf of Sir Roger. The battle was to be fought on the internecine principle, no quarter being given or taken on either side; and of course this gave Mr Moffat as much as he knew how to do.|$|R
