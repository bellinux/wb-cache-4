40|$|It is {{currently}} not known {{what are the}} best working memory training strategies to offset the age-related declines in fluid cognitive abilities. In this randomized clinical double-blind trial, older adults {{were randomly assigned to}} one of two types of working memory training - one group was trained on a predictable memory updating task (PT) and another group was trained on a novel, unpredictable memory updating task (UT). Unpredictable memory updating, compared to predictable, requires greater demands on cognitive control (Basak & Verhaeghen, 2011 a). Therefore, the current study allowed us to evaluate the role of cognitive control in working memory training. All participants were assessed on a set of near and far transfer tasks at three different testing sessions - before training, immediately after the training, and 1. 5 months after completing the training. Additionally, individual learning rates for a comparison working memory task (performed by both groups) and the trained task were computed. Training on unpredictable memory updating, compared to predictable, significantly enhanced performance on a measure of episodic memory, immediately after the training. Moreover, individuals with faster learning rates showed greater gains in this episodic memory task and another new working memory task; this effect was specific to UT. We propose that the unpredictable memory <b>updating</b> <b>training,</b> compared to predictable memory <b>updating</b> <b>training,</b> may a better strategy to improve selective cognitive abilities in older adults, and future studies could further investigate the role of cognitive control in working memory training...|$|E

40|$|Background: A {{wide range}} of {{medications}} are now available {{for the treatment of}} asthma and selection of the optimal treatment combination of agents is essential. Objectives: This study was designed to evaluate a self-reported drug prescribing pattern for asthma among Nigerian doctors in general practice. Methods: It was a cross-sectional survey conducted among general practitioners in six states of Nigeria. Results: For acute severe asthma, 75. 9 % of the doctors prescribed intravenous methylxanthines, which was combined with oral or inhaled short-acting β 2 agonists (SABA) by 56. 3 % of them. Systemic steroids were prescribed mainly via the intravenous route by 58. 8 % of them. Aberrant drugs such as antibiotics, antihistamines, and mucolytics were prescribed by 25. 6 % of them. For long-term, follow-up treatment of asthma, oral steroids, and oral SABA were commonly prescribed, while inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and ICS/LABA (long acting beta agonists) were infrequently prescribed. Aberrant drugs such as analgesics, antimalaria, and antihistamines were prescribed by 22. 8 % of them. About 48 % of the doctors had never attended any form of <b>update</b> <b>training</b> on asthma management, whereas, only 16. 3 % attended <b>update</b> <b>training</b> on asthma within the last year preceding this study.

40|$|During {{the past}} decade, working memory {{training}} has attracted much interest. However, the training outcomes have varied between studies and methodological problems have hampered {{the interpretation of}} results.

Thirty-one healthy Finnish young adults were randomized into either a working memory training group or an active control group. The working memory training group practiced with three working memory tasks, while the control group trained with three commercial computer games with a low working memory load. The participants trained thrice a week for five weeks, with one training session lasting about 45 minutes. Compared to the control group, the working memory training group showed strongest transfer to an n-back task, followed by working memory updating, which in turn was followed by active working memory capacity. Our results support the view that working memory training produces near transfer effects, and that the degree of transfer depends on the cognitive overlap between the training and transfer measures...|$|E

This trainer’s manual is a freely available learning resource for <b>updating,</b> <b>training</b> and supporting care co-ordinators with the new guidance. The care co-ordinator role may be taken on by a range of mental health and social care workers, most commonly nurses, doctors, occupational therapists or social workers.

40|$|An {{incremental}} learning system updates itself {{in response to}} incoming data without reexamining all the old data. Since classification systems capable of incrementally storing, filtering, and classifying data are economical, {{in terms of both}} space and time, which makes them immensely useful for industrial, military, and commercial purposes, interest in designing them is growing. However, the challenge with {{incremental learning}} is that classification tasks can no longer be seen as unvarying, since they can actually change with the evolution of the data. These changes in turn cause dynamic changes to occur in the classification system's parameters If such variations are neglected, the overall perfonnance of these systems will be compromised in the future. In this thesis, on the development of a system capable of incrementally accommodating new data and dynamically tracking new optimum system parameters for self-adaptation, we first address the optimum selection of classifiers over time. We propose a framework which combinesthe power of Swann Intelligence Theory and the conventional grid-search method to progressively identify potential solutions for gradually <b>updating</b> <b>training</b> datasets. The key here is to consider the adjustment of classifier parameters as a dynamic optimization problem that depends on the data available. Specifically, it has been shown that, if the intention is to build efficient Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers from sources that provide data gradually and serially, then {{the best way to do}} this is to consider model selection as a dynamic process which can evolve and change over time. This means that a number of solutions are required, depending on the knowledge available about the problem and uncertainties in the data. We also investigate measures for evaluating and selecting classifier ensembles composed of SVM classifiers. The measures employed are based on two different theories (diversity and margin) commonly used to understand the success of ensembles. This study has given us valuable insights and helped us to establish confidence-based measures as a tool for the selection of classifier ensembles. The main contribution of this thesis is a dynamic optimization approach that performs incremental learning in an adaptive fashion by tracking, evolving, and combining optimum hypotheses over time. The approach incorporates various theories, such as dynamic Particle Swann Optimization, incremental Support Vector Machine classifiers, change detection, and dynamic ensemble selection based on classifier confidence levels. Experiments carried out on synthetic and real-world databases demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the classification methods often used in incremental learning scenarios...|$|E
