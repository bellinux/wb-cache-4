The East German leadership considered <b>using</b> <b>force</b> but ultimately backed down, lacking support from the Soviet Union for a violent Tiananmen Square-style military intervention. Reformist members of the East German Politbüro sought to rescue the situation by forcing the resignation of the hardline Party chairman Erich Honecker, replacing him in October 1989 with the marginally less hardline Egon Krenz.|$|E
5|$|Despite Blom-Cooper's {{recommendations}} that Bird never {{be allowed to}} hold public office again and strong opposition disapproval, he was made Minister of Science, Technology and Communications in a cabinet reshuffle on 15 May 1996. He soon found himself {{at odds with the}} Prime Minister; after the government announced plans to evict Thomas Bufton and his wife from Guiana Island, where they had lived for 32 years, in order to build a tourist resort, Bird began serving as the Buftons' lawyer. A dispute between Bufton and Bird led to a fight at Bird's law offices, during which he was shot in the mouth and taken to intensive care on 16 December 1997; this followed Bird speaking up for the Buftons' cause before voting in support of a motion to allow the police to evict them, <b>using</b> <b>force</b> if necessary. Bufton was later acquitted of attempted murder, but still evicted.|$|E
5|$|Drivers are {{not legally}} {{required}} to take field sobriety tests, although the results are admissible in court. The Alcotest has replaced the Breathalyzer as the standard device for determining blood alcohol level. When a driver is arrested for DUI, the police are prohibited from <b>using</b> <b>force</b> to obtain a breath, blood, or urine sample, and must warn {{the driver of the}} consequences of refusing a breath sample. In 2010, the New Jersey Supreme Court overturned the breath sample refusal conviction of a non-English speaking driver, ruling that drivers must be notified of the law in a language that they understand. A person can be charged with DUI or breath refusal up to 90 days after the incident, except in cases of serious injury or death, in which case the statute of limitations is 5 years.|$|E
50|$|Police {{officers}} and court officials {{have a general}} power to <b>use</b> <b>force</b> {{for the purpose of}} performing an arrest or generally carrying out their official duties.

50|$|Policies on <b>use</b> of <b>force</b> can differ between departments. The type of {{policies}} established {{and whether or}} not they are enforced can affect an officer's likeliness to <b>use</b> <b>force.</b> If policies are established, but not enforced heavily by the department, the policies may not make a difference. For example, the Rodney King case was described as a problem with the departmental supervision not being clear on policies of (excessive) force. Training offered by the department can be a contributing factor, as well, though it has only been a recent addition to include information on when to <b>use</b> <b>force,</b> rather than how to <b>use</b> <b>force.</b>|$|R
5|$|Over {{the next}} two years, the Byzantines {{increased}} their forces in Lazica, but failed to achieve decisive success; Gubazes quarreled with their generals, and wrote to Emperor Justinian accusing them of incompetence following a defeat by the Persians. Bessas was recalled, but the other two, Martin and the sacellarius Rusticus, resolved {{to get rid of}} Gubazes. They sent a message to Constantinople accusing Gubazes of dealings with the Persians. Emperor Justinian, intending to question Gubazes himself, authorized the two generals to arrest him, <b>using</b> <b>force</b> if necessary. The two Byzantine generals then (September/October 555) invited Gubazes to observe the siege of a Persian-held fort, but when they met, John, Rusticus's brother, stabbed the king with his dagger. Gubazes fell from his horse, and one of Rusticus's servants gave him the finishing blow.|$|E
5|$|Beginning the mission's fourth spacewalk at 13:45 UTC, Massimino and Good {{went to work}} {{repairing}} the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The spectrograph failed in 2004 due to a blown power supply. As with the ACS, the STIS was not designed {{with the intention of}} servicing it while in space, and one of the major challenges was to remove a cover plate held tight with over 100 screws using a specially designed tool called a fastener-capture plate, designed to trap the screws and washers and prevent them from floating into space when removed. While preparing the fastener-capture plate, Massimino encountered issues with a handrail that had to be removed to accommodate the fastener-capture plate. The handrail had a stripped bolt on the bottom, preventing it from being released. After trying multiple options without success, managers on the ground advised Massimino to use brute force to remove the handrail, so he could proceed with the removal of the cover plate. The procedure was tested at Goddard Space Flight Center prior to approving it, showing that the stripped bolt could be broken off safely <b>using</b> <b>force.</b> Working inside the orbiter, Feustel walked Massimino through the procedure slowly, advising him to tape the handrail with Kapton tape to prevent any parts from breaking off or flying loose, {{to be aware of the}} reaction the force would have, as well as to watch for sharp edges on the handrail after removal.|$|E

40|$|The Article starts by {{investigating}} {{the manner in}} which the prohibition to <b>use</b> <b>force</b> is being incrementally corroded. In particular, it argues that the evanescence of the rule expressed in Article 2 (4) of the U. N. Charter does not stem from a conscious disregard for the prohibition on the <b>use</b> <b>force</b> since most States still feel constrained by it. Instead, it is submitted that the disintegration of the prohibition on the <b>use</b> <b>force</b> results from a general striving for looser limitations on that prohibition. This phenomenon is construed here as a liberalization of the <b>use</b> of <b>force.</b> Once it has been established how the prohibition on the <b>use</b> of <b>force</b> is being liberalized, only then this Article engages in a study of its consequences for the international legal order...|$|R

40|$|The {{authority}} to <b>use</b> <b>force,</b> including lethal force is a defining {{feature of the}} police profession. A police officer’s decision to <b>use</b> <b>force</b> carries potentially significant consequences for all involved and is arguably the most heavily scrutinized aspect of modern police work, despite its rare use. Situations involving the <b>use</b> of <b>force</b> are often characterized by a rapidly evolving scenario, complex environment, considerable uncertainty, and a potentially high degree of fear. These factors make it extremely challenging for officers to decide when and how to act. The high stakes nature of police <b>use</b> of <b>force</b> events and the level of scrutiny that the <b>use</b> of <b>force</b> attracts places a premium on the quality of training that officers are given, both in terms of content and application. Yet, in spite of the importance ascribed to training, the research in this area is limited, particularly from a Canadian perspective. What is known about <b>use</b> of <b>force</b> training comes largely from research and experience in the U. S. A., a significantly different policing environment than Canada. Using a qualitative research framework, this thesis seeks to fill the gap in Canadian <b>use</b> of <b>force</b> research and shed light on recruit and in-service training that is given to police officers. Using in-depth, semi-structured interviews with ten Canadian police academy and department-based <b>use</b> of <b>force</b> instructors, this study explores the factors involved in police <b>use</b> of <b>force</b> situations and how <b>use</b> of <b>force</b> training prepares officers for <b>use</b> of <b>force</b> events in Canada. The findings indicate that while current police training is evolving to better prepare officers for the realities of police <b>use</b> of <b>force</b> encounters, it is nonetheless limited by a number of factors. These factors are identified and discussed noting the implications for police services, policing scholars, and police oversight bodies...|$|R

40|$|A simplistic {{explanation}} of why tropical forests degrade or disappear all together is, because loggers take out too many trees, companies convert forest for plantations, and small farmers slash forest to make agricultural fields. Political ecology is a scientific inter-discipline that tries to identify the political dimension of forest resource appropriation, contestation over forest benefits, {{and the role of}} power and discourse in the processes of unsustainable use and resulting forest degradation. This chapter summarizes ten chapters in the volume in which it is published. Several of chapters demonstrate that modern struggles over forests have their roots in colonial periods. Colonial powers <b>used</b> <b>force,</b> but also the argument that deforestation negatively affected the local climate, to expulse forest farmers from timber rich forest lands. Often control of the trade of lucrative forest products like rattan was decided by force. In these struggles, colonial powers <b>used</b> <b>force</b> against local Sultans, local Sultans <b>used</b> <b>force</b> against forest dwellers, and powerful forest dweller groups <b>used</b> <b>force</b> against weaker groups...|$|R
