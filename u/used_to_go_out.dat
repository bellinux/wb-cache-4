25|$|There {{is another}} Nattapara in Hooghly district, a remote village in Balagarh block. There are some 100 dhakis in the village. There {{is not a}} single family without a dhaki. All <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> to work as dhakis during the festive season, but now the demand has {{declined}} {{to such an extent that}} many are forced to give up the traditional profession and work as wage labourers. Worse still, a dhaki from the village was contacted by a well-known Durga Puja in Kolkata for Rs. 2,000. After he had performed his duties they paid him less and insulted him. It is not an isolated incident and there are similar complaints from dhakis in the Tarakeswar and Dhaniakhali regions.|$|E

[...] The song [...] "Bodysnatchers" [...] {{is inspired by}} Victorian ghost stories, the 1972 novel The Stepford Wives and Yorke's feeling of [...] "your physical consciousness trapped {{without being able to}} connect fully with anything else." [...] "Jigsaw Falling into Place" [...] is about a set of observations and different experiences, partly of the chaos witnessed by Yorke when he <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> on the weekend in Oxford. Yorke said [...] "The lyrics are quite caustic—the idea of 'before you're comatose' or whatever, drinking yourself into oblivion and getting fucked-up to forget ... is partly this elation. But there's a much darker side." ...|$|E

Her other television roles include recurring appearances as Marlene on Dharma & Greg, and Penny in two episodes of Dead Like Me. Smith has also appeared in Phil of the Future and Teen Angel. Her one-scene role as pregnant checkout girl Nancy in 1991's City Slickers earned her [...] "more attention than all [...] previous roles combined", and taught her [...] "that it's far better to have small parts in big movies that everyone sees." [...] In 1997, she appeared as Lulu the palm reader in the independent film Just Write. Her other roles include parts in Barry Levinson's Toys and James L. Brooks' As Good as It Gets. Brooks, who is also executive producer of The Simpsons, had cast Smith in his 1994 film I'll Do Anything (in one of the film's musical numbers), but her part was cut. Aside from The Simpsons, Smith has recorded few voice-over parts, only commercials and the film We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story. She [...] "had a voice-over agent for about two years, and I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> [...] all the time, but it never really came to anything. Everybody said, 'Oh Yeardley, you'll clean up,' and that was definitely not the case." ...|$|E
500|$|Johnson was a devout, {{conservative}} Anglican and {{a compassionate}} man who supported {{a number of}} poor friends under his own roof, even when unable to fully provide for himself. Johnson's Christian morality permeated his works, and he would write on moral topics with such authority and in such a trusting manner that, Walter Jackson Bate claims, [...] "no other moralist in history excels or even begins to rival him". However, Johnson's moral writings do not contain, as Donald Greene points out, [...] "a predetermined and authorized pattern of 'good behavior, even though Johnson does emphasise certain kinds of conduct. He did not let his own faith prejudice him against others, and had respect for those of other denominations who demonstrated a commitment to Christ's teachings. Although Johnson respected John Milton's poetry, he could not tolerate Milton's Puritan and Republican beliefs, feeling that they were contrary to England and Christianity. He was an opponent of slavery on moral grounds, and once proposed a toast to the [...] "next rebellion of the negroes in the West Indies". Beside his beliefs concerning humanity, Johnson is also known for his love of cats, especially his own two cats, Hodge and Lily. Boswell wrote, [...] "I never shall forget the indulgence with which he treated Hodge, his cat: for whom he himself <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and buy oysters, lest the servants having that trouble should take a dislike to the poor creature." [...] It is a common error to think that these oysters were expensive, since they are so in modern Britain. However, in Johnson's time they were very cheap and eaten by the poor. [...] He thought that his servant, Frank, might resent Hodge {{if he had to}} go buy the oysters for him.|$|E

[...] In two 1903 interviews with the Pall Mall Gazette, Abberline spelled out his suspicions, referring to Kłosowski by name. Abberline thought Chapman was Jack the Ripper because during the [...] "Jack the Ripper" [...] frenzy he had closely interviewed his first [...] "wife" [...] since arriving in England, Lucie Badewski, and she had told him that her husband often <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> during the night for hours on end.|$|E

40|$|People are {{increasingly}} growing older. Growing older {{is likely to}} come with, for example, decreasing mobility and therefore increasing dependency. This can reduce the social connectedness of older people. As an effect, a social challenge is growing: loneliness. In response to this challenge, local governments offer mobility services that the elderly can <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out.</b> However, from our test bed of a mobility product-service system for seniors, we learned that many such services focus too much on transporting people from A to B, while the user experience of the service leaves room for improvement. In this paper we discuss how a demand responsive transport system, set-up as a social innovation, improves social connectedness, instead of delivering mobility alone. We found that the service itself provides social satisfaction, and that the service was not necessarily used for social activities. Rather, the service was used for activities of daily life...|$|R

2500|$|The Mishnah {{interpreted}} {{the prohibition of}} animals working in [...] (20:10 in the NJPS) to teach that on the Sabbath, animals could wear their tethers, and their caretakers could lead them by their tethers and sprinkle or immerse them with water. The Mishnah taught that a donkey could {{go out with a}} saddle cushion tied to it, rams strapped, ewes covered, and goats with their udders tied. Rabbi Jose forbade all these, except covering ewes. Rabbi Judah allowed goats to go out with their udders tied to dry, but not to save their milk. The Mishnah taught that animals could not go out with a pad tied to their tails. A driver could not tie camels together and pull one of them, but a driver could take the leads of several camels in hand and pull them. The Mishnah prohibited donkeys with untied cushions, bells, ladder–shaped yokes, or thongs around their feet; fowls with ribbons or leg straps; rams with wagons; ewes protected by wood chips in their noses; calves with little yokes; and cows with hedgehog skins or straps between their horns. The Mishnah reported that Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah's cow <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> with a thong between its horns, but without the consent of the Rabbis.|$|E

As a result, the fish and octopus began to dwindle. Then scientists, who had heard of their plight, came to Madagascar and worked beside them. The Vezo learned how to rotate their fishing grounds, avoid hunting octopus for a season and how to plant seaweed which would not only become a crash crop for them but would supplement their livelihood, further relieving the pressure on fishing and octopus hunting.|$|R
