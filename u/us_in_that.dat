In other countries, McDonald's restaurants are operated by joint ventures of McDonald's Corporation and other, local entities or governments.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the US oil {{marketing}} hub at Cushing {{was flooded}} with new oil because most new North American production from Canada, North Dakota, and Texas converged at that point, and there was insufficient capacity to {{take it from there}} to refineries on the Gulf Coast, where half of US oil refinery capacity is located. The American pipeline system is designed to take imported oil from the Gulf Coast and Texas to the refineries in the northern US, and the new oil was flowing in the opposite direction, toward the Gulf Coast. The price of West Texas Intermediate delivered at Cushing, which is the main benchmark for US oil prices, fell to unprecedented low levels below other international benchmark oils such as Brent Crude and Dubai Crude. Since the price of WTI at Cushing is usually quoted by US media as the price of oil, this gave many Americans a distorted view of world oil prices as being lower than they were, and the supply being better than it was internationally. Canada used to be in a similar position to the <b>US</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> offshore oil was cheaper than domestic oil, so the oil pipelines used to run westward from the east coast to Central Canada, now they are being reversed to carry cheaper domestic oil sands production from Alberta to the east coast.|$|E
500|$|The spacewalk was {{completed}} in six hours and thirty-six minutes, and the ACS passed the initial aliveness tests. It was the twenty-first Hubble servicing spacewalk, and Grunsfeld's seventh EVA, moving him up to fourth in the record book of spacewalking time. During the previous day's mission status briefing, Dave Leckrone, Hubble Space Telescope Senior Project Scientist, made a prediction, joking that since the first two spacewalks, which {{were considered to be}} straightforward, had run into issues, the most difficult EVA – to repair the ACS, would be the smoothest one of the mission. [...] "I have a prediction, We've always said EVA 3 {{was going to be the}} most difficult and the most challenging, and I predict it's going to go more smoothly than any other EVA on this mission. I just think that's some version of Murphy's Law that's going to lead <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> direction." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, {{along with the}} countercultural movement, {{a new form of}} comic art {{appeared}} from the avant-garde and literary scenes—underground comics (or [...] "comix") aimed at an adult audience. Early examples appeared in certain magazines, but an early precursor of Canadian underground comic books was Scraptures, as a special issue of the Toronto avant-garde literary magazine grOnk in 1967. In 1969, Canada saw its first true underground comics, with SFU Komix and Snore Comix. These comix drew their inspiration from the American underground movement that exploded after the release of Robert Crumb's Zap in early 1968. Martin Vaugh-James produced an early graphic novel when he had Elephant released by Press Porcépic in 1970. The underground movement paralleled that of the <b>US,</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> it peaked from 1970 to 1972 with the peak of the counterculture, and witnessed a sharp decline afterward. Saskatoon, Saskatchewan's Dave Geary and Vancouver, BC's Rand Holmes were key figures, Holmes being the creator of the Harold Hedd comic strip.|$|E
500|$|In the episode, the {{character}} of Sheriff Graham was killed off, something that actor Jamie Dornan had known would happen since ABC picked up the pilot. It {{was the first major}} death of the series. In an interview with E! reporter Kristin Dos Santos, Dornan hinted that while his counterpart in Storybrooke has died, the huntsman could return at some point, as Dornan is still a regular on the series. As much of the episode involves Graham discovering his fairytale past, the writers designed the episode to mislead viewers by having them invest in {{the character}}. Kitsis and Horowitz commented that while the death made them [...] "sad," [...] the battle between Emma and Regina requires [...] "stakes and unfortunately, sometimes stakes are people's lives." [...] They also decided to kill the character relatively early in the series in order to show viewers that [...] "it's real. It's not in Henry's head." [...] Kitsis continued, [...] "It’s interesting, but part of the intent was to make you love him and we loved him very much. And the fact that the audience seems to have loved him means a lot to <b>us,</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> we feel like we succeeded on that front. If you don’t feel sad, then it was a failure of the execution of the story." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Japan, bacon (ベーコン) is {{pronounced}} [...] "bēkon". It is cured and smoked belly meat {{as in the}} US, and is sold in either regular or half-length sizes.

Uncured belly rashers, known as bara (バラ), are very popular in Japan and are used in a variety of dishes (e.g. yakitori and yakiniku).|$|E

2500|$|Henley {{decided on}} the theme of Hotel California, noting how The Beverly Hills Hotel had become a literal and {{symbolic}} focal point of their lives at that time. Henley said of their personal and professional experience in LA: [...] "We were getting an extensive education, in life, in love, in business. Beverly Hills was still a mythical place to <b>us.</b> <b>In</b> <b>that</b> sense it became something of a symbol, and the 'Hotel' the locus of all that LA had come to mean for us. In a sentence, I'd sum it up {{as the end of the}} innocence, round one." ...|$|E
2500|$|The university's fraternities and sororities system (or Greek system) is {{somewhat}} {{different from other}} large universities in the southern <b>U.S.</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> there are no Greek houses on campus, as interfraternity activity did not begin until 1970, following the abolishing of the military cadre requirements at the university. There are residence halls designated for fraternities and sororities, {{but there are no}} traditional Greek houses on campus. However, there are a few fraternity houses off campus near the college. The Fraternity Quad on campus (consisting of seven fraternity and sorority halls) is certified by the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program.
