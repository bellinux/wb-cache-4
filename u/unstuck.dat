Tottenham managed to withstand pressure from Arsenal for most of the second half, but came <b>unstuck</b> in the 73rd minute when Pirès scored the decisive goal.|$|E
5|$|However, Purcell's music (and with it The Fairy-Queen) was resuscitated by {{two related}} movements: a growing {{interest}} in Baroque music {{and the rise of}} the countertenor, led by pioneers such as Alfred Deller and Russell Oberlin. The former movement led to performances of long-neglected composers such as Purcell, John Dowland, John Blow and even George Frideric Handel, while the latter complemented it by providing a way of making such performances as authentic as possible as regards the original music and the composer's intentions (less true for Handel, where countertenors appear as castrati replacements). This has led to The Fairy-Queen's increased popularity, and numerous recordings have been made, often using period instruments. The format of the work presents problems to modern directors, who must decide whether or not to present Purcell's music as part of the original play, which uncut is rather lengthy. Savage calculated a length of four hours. The decision to curtail the play is usually taken together with the resolution to modernise to such an extent that the cohesion between music, text and action sketched above is entirely lost, a criticism levelled at the English National Opera's 1995 production directed by David Pountney. The production was released on video the same year, and revived by the company in 2002. A bold approach was taken at the Brazilian Opera Company's 2000 staging by Luiz Päetow, with the libretto becoming <b>unstuck</b> in time.|$|E
25|$|Vieira {{was given}} a mandate by the club to reduce {{the average age of}} the squad. He made his {{managerial}} debut with the club in a 1–0 pre-season friendly win versus OKC Energy. His team won five out of six games in preseason, turning over opponents FGCE, OKC Energy, Montreal Impact, HB Køge and Knattspyrnufélag Reykjavíkur, only coming <b>unstuck</b> versus FC Cincinnati.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Kilkenny were {{aiming to}} capture an elusive third All-Ireland title in-a-row. The plan came <b>unstuck</b> in the Leinster {{championship}} when Wexford GAA brought Kilkenny’s provincial championship run of success to an end. ‘The Cats’ later reached the All-Ireland final; however, Cork pounced and defeated their arch-rivals. 2005 started well with Cody’s side winning National League and Leinster honours. However, their season {{ended with a}} defeat by Galway GAA in the All-Ireland semi-final.|$|E
25|$|Quinlan's {{enterprise}} came <b>unstuck</b> and {{he managed}} no more grand opera seasons. Despite the crash in Canada some artists had definitely been re-engaged and contracts signed. But {{the outbreak of}} World War I put paid finally {{to the possibility of}} Quinlan's plan to bring another company to Australia in 1915. The Quinlan Company became the Harrison Frewin Company, which was acquired by the impresario H B Phillips in 1916 for £1,750. In October 1918 the Carl Rosa Company acquired the Phillips and Harrison Frewin companies.|$|E
25|$|A {{largely unknown}} Kerry Packer arrived in London in late May 1977. He {{appeared}} on David Frost's The Frost Programme to debate his concept with commentators Jim Laker and Robin Marlar. Marlar's aggressive, indignant interrogation of Packer came <b>unstuck</b> when Packer {{proved to be}} articulate, witty and confident that his vision was {{the way of the}} future. The show significantly raised Packer's profile and converted some to his way of thinking. The main goal of his trip was to meet the game's authorities and reach some type of compromise. He made a canny move by securing Richie Benaud as a consultant. Benaud's standing in the game and his journalistic background helped steer Packer through the politics of the game.|$|E
25|$|Following their {{performance}} in 2003 Cork {{were regarded as}} one of the favourites to take the championship title in 2004. Some change to the team saw star forward Setanta Ó hAilpín depart while former star Brian Corcoran made a dramatic comeback. Cork's plan came <b>unstuck</b> in the Munster final when 14-man Waterford defeated O'Grady's side by a single point. This game is {{regarded as one of}} the greatest provincial finals ever played. Cork later qualified for the All-Ireland final via the qualifiers and, for the second year in-a-row, Kilkenny provided the opposition. After a poor first-half the sides were evenly matched, however, the final 23 minutes saw Cork score nine points without reply from Kilkenny. O'Grady had led Cork out of the doldrums and to an All-Ireland title.|$|E
25|$|Left {{unanswered}} by {{the professional}} analyses {{was the question}} of whose open microphone captured the sounds recorded on the Dictabelt, if not Officer H.B. McLain. Jim Bowles, a Dallas police dispatcher supervisor in November 1963, and later Dallas County Sheriff, believes it originated from a particular officer on a three-wheeled motorcycle stationed at the Dallas Trade Mart, the original destination of President Kennedy's motorcade, along the same freeway to Parkland Hospital, which would account {{for the sound of}} sirens rushing by. McLain himself believes that it was from a different officer on a three-wheeler near the Trade Mart, who was known for his whistling. When interviewed by author Vincent Bugliosi, the officer acknowledged that his microphone could have been stuck in the open position (he did not recall hearing any transmissions for several minutes), and could later have become <b>unstuck</b> after he followed the motorcade to Parkland Hospital.|$|E
25|$|Commons endured {{an injury}} plagued 2006–07 season, but {{still managed to}} hit 14 goals in all {{competitions}} in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to keep the club's dream of promotion to the Championship alive, which including a vital goal against league leaders Scunthorpe United. He had a particularly productive last six matches scoring six and chipping in with a further four assists, though Forest ultimately came <b>unstuck</b> in the playoff semi-finals against Yeovil Town. Despite rumours {{that he was going}} elsewhere on a Bosman deal, Commons signed a new one-year deal with Forest on 2 July 2007 and made his 100th league appearance for Forest in the opening game of the 2007–08 campaign which finished 0–0 at home to Bournemouth. Forest eventually won promotion back into the second tier as runners up to Swansea City, following a 3–2 home victory against Yeovil Town, the team who had denied them promotion 12 months earlier. Commons was named in the PFA League One Team of the Year.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} thirty-minute {{practice}} session, Asmer {{spent most of}} his time evaluating a new car setup that improved straightline speed and continued his strong form by posting the fastest lap of the session with a time of two minutes and 12.894 seconds. Tsukakoshi ended the session second-fastest and was only 0.038 seconds slower than Asmer's pace. Jarvis ran consistently near the top of the time sheets for the majority of practice and finished in third. Mortara was fourth-quickest; Oshima was fifth and Grosjean sixth. Buemi was seventh-fastest, Streit eighth, Jelley ninth and Van Dam completed the top ten ahead of second qualifying. Although no red flags were necessitated during the session, several drivers came <b>unstuck.</b> Mailleux spun at Lisboa corner and broke his rear wing, while Mustonen continued after spinning at the R Bend but later crashed at Lisboa after hitting another vehicle. Jakes prematurely ended his session in the barriers at Moorish Hill with eleven minutes remaining.|$|E
25|$|The 2004 tournament {{was held}} in Bangladesh. More than 350,000 spectators saw the 54 matches played in the tournament. The finale ended with a close final between the two best teams - West Indies and Pakistan. It was won by Pakistan by 25 runs against West Indies and a 30,000 crowd {{acclaimed}} the victorious Pakistanis almost as their own. The players, from the ten Test countries and six other nations, were feted wherever they went, and the appetite for cricket was remarkable: even Zimbabwe v Canada sold out. The shock was the elimination from the main competition of holders Australia, bowled out for 73 and beaten by Zimbabwe in the group stage when Tinashe Panyangara took 6 for 31, the second-best figures in the competition's history. And Australia then lost to Bangladesh in the plate final amid thumping drums and gleeful celebrations. The downside was {{the quality of the}} cricket, which was often mediocre on some indifferent pitches, and the reporting of six unidentified bowlers for having suspect actions. Pakistan would have finished unbeaten but for a hiccup against England - when both teams had already qualified for the semis. England reached the last four, which was progress, and Alastair Cook looked a class apart. But they came <b>unstuck</b> against West Indies' spinners in the semi-final. India completed the semi-finalists. Dhawan and Suresh Raina were the backbone of a strong batting line-up, and Raina's 90 from just 38 balls against the hapless Scots was as brutal an innings as one will see at any level. Both looked international-class already, though faced with a tough task breaking into their senior side's formidable top order. The captain Ambati Rayudu had been hailed as the next great batting hope, having scored a century and a double in a first-class match at the age of 17. But he did not score the runs promised and was banned by the referee John Morrison from the semi-final after allowing a funereal over-rate during the Super League win against Sri Lanka: eight overs were bowled in the first 50 minutes. India's Shikhar Dhawan was named Man of the Tournament, and was the tournament's leading run-scorer, with 505 runs at an average of 84.16. Bangladeshi Enamul Haque was the leading wicket-taker, with 22 wickets at 10.18.|$|E
500|$|Kurt Vonnegut has {{inspired}} numerous posthumous tributes and works. In 2008, the Kurt Vonnegut Society was established, and in November 2010, the Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library was opened in Vonnegut's hometown of Indianapolis. The Library of America published {{a compendium of}} Vonnegut's compositions between 1963 and 1973 the following April, and another compendium of his earlier works in 2012. Late 2011 saw the release of two Vonnegut biographies, Gregory Sumner's <b>Unstuck</b> in Time and Charles J. Shields's And So It Goes. Shields's biography of Vonnegut created some controversy. According to The Guardian, the book portrays Vonnegut as distant, cruel and nasty. [...] "Cruel, nasty and scary are the adjectives commonly used to describe him by the friends, colleagues, and relatives Shields quotes", said The Daily Beasts Wendy Smith. [...] "Towards the end he was very feeble, very depressed and almost morose", said Jerome Klinkowitz of the University of Northern Iowa, who has examined Vonnegut in depth.|$|E
500|$|However, in late 1941 the United States {{entered the}} war after Adolf Hitler's {{declaration}} of war on 11 December 1941. The failure of Operation Barbarossa by that time had meant the Luftwaffes method of concentrating all its resources {{on the front line}} was coming <b>unstuck.</b> The RAF began its campaign of night bombing in early 1942 and by mid-August of 1942, the [...] United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) would enter the air war in force. Even so, the OKL continued to resist sending its forces to defend Germany and weakening the front lines. It was only in May 1942—when the Luftwaffe faced the USAAF {{for the first time in}} daylight engagements—that the danger of Allied strategic bombing by day gave the OKL cause for concern. Nevertheless, even by the end of 1942 the measures taken to strengthen daylight anti-aircraft defences remained piecemeal and counter productive. Hans Jeschonnek summed up the attitude of the OKL when he stated that the Luftwaffe could deal with the Western Allies' daylight raids with [...] "one" [...] fighter wing. The events of 1943–1944 would prove this assumption wrong. Adolf Galland—General der Jagdflieger (General of the Fighter Force), 1941–1945—gave lack of organisation and of planning for air defence as one of the greatest mistakes made by the Luftwaffe during the war.|$|E
500|$|Reviews were positive. James Poniewozik of Time {{thought that}} [...] "Because You Left" [...] {{provided}} a good balance of characterization and mythology and commended {{the character of}} Faraday, partially [...] "because a perfectly-cast Jeremy Davies has {{turned him into a}} likeable, flawed, brusque, slightly-in-over-his-head nebbish-god." [...] Matt Mitovich of TV Guide stated that the premiere [...] "offer compelling twists … the foundation is laid for a pivotal penultimate season … it sends the mind reeling and uncorks infinite possibilities." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that [...] "it's hard to name a series that is as engaging, surprising and flat-out gorgeous as Lost, or one in which every effort and penny expended seems to be put to shimmering good use. [...] This is an epic big-screen adventure done for the small screen—and done {{in a way that makes}} most big-screen versions pale in comparison." [...] Bianco also commended the characterizations, noting them as realistic and compelling. [...] Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune praised the opening sequence, calling it [...] "really, really great … nerd-tastic for [...] hardcore Lost fan; it's full of shout-outs and callbacks to classic Lost moments and trivia." [...] She concluded that the premiere is [...] "quite good" [...] (three and a half out of four stars) with [...] "a lot to like", specifically the expanded screen time for Faraday; however, Ryan expressed difficulty in understanding the use of time (travel) in the show and felt that one to two more viewings were warranted for her to give a better review of that aspect. [...] Verne Gay of Newsday summed up that [...] "The season's premiere represents pig-in-the-python storytelling—there's so much to work through, so many details, stories, characters and time dimensions to attend to, that after a while this all starts to feel like a very full meal. [...] A bloated feeling may result." [...] Among other pieces of praise, Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle was impressed by the [...] "parallel plotting" [...] of the characters on and off the island in different times. [...] Despite deeming the premiere [...] "riveting" [...] and the script [...] "tantalizing as ever", Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe had a mixed response, for he worried that he would not be able to handle a season's worth of time travel, stating that [...] "I may be alone in this, and I hope I will be proven wrong, but I expected the solution to [...] "Lost" [...] to be more metaphysical, and more original, than simply people being <b>unstuck</b> in time." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger deemed it [...] "really good, in terms of keeping the momentum from last season going, servicing the characters and their emotions, and providing an appropriate number of 'Whoa's per hour." [...] In a three out of four stars review, Thomas Connor of the Chicago Sun-Times stated that [...] "the time-travel training wheels are coming off—and the path thus far seems blissfully free of the usual stumbling blocks", due to the previous four seasons of [...] "baby steps" [...] that set up the science fiction driven fifth season. [...] Caryn Kunz of the Honolulu Advertiser said that [...] "This was a great episode to get back into every aspect of our favorite show: relationships, mythology, reunions/cameos, and enough whoa moments to keep me on the edge of my seat throughout." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{book has}} been {{classified}} as a postmodern, metafictional novel. The first chapter of Slaughterhouse-Five is written {{in the style of}} an author's preface about how he came to write the novel. The Narrator begins the novel by telling of his connection to the Dresden bombing, and why he is recording it. He gives a description of himself, and the book, saying that it is a desperate attempt at scholarly work. He segues to the story of Billy Pilgrim: [...] "Listen: Billy Pilgrim has come <b>unstuck</b> in time," [...] thus the transition from the writer's perspective to that of the third-person, omniscient Narrator. (The use of [...] "Listen" [...] as an opening interjection mimics the epic poem Beowulf.) The Narrator introduces Slaughterhouse-Five with the novel's genesis and ends the first chapter by discussing {{the beginning and the end}} of the novel. The fictional [...] "story" [...] appears to begin in chapter two, although there is no reason to presume that the first chapter is not fiction. This technique is common to postmodern meta-fiction. The story purports to be a disjointed narrative, from Billy Pilgrim's point of view, of being <b>unstuck</b> in time. Vonnegut's writing usually contains such disorder. He apologizes for the novel being [...] "so short and jumbled and jangled," [...] but says [...] "there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Gary Flint, the truck's Variable Torque Management Four-Wheel Drive (VTM-4) system —co-developed with BorgWarner— [...] "provides {{front-wheel drive}} for dry-pavement {{cruising}} conditions and engages all-wheel drive when {{needed to improve}} stability or maneuverability" [...] and supports medium duty off-road use. The electromagnetically driven clutch-operated differential can be manually locked (VTM-4 Lock) to help the truck better handle adverse terrain or become <b>unstuck.</b> It also has a four-channel fully automatic Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA) system {{that is designed to}} enhance control during acceleration, cornering, and collision-avoidance maneuvers and can be manually disabled to prevent undesirable throttle intervention in off-road conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Lancashire's reply {{started to}} come <b>unstuck</b> when both openers, Stuart Law and Iain Sutcliffe, fell in {{successive}} balls with the score on 23. The game saw the return of Andrew Flintoff, back after his operation and playing just as a batsman. But he couldn't stop the rot and made only 17 before falling lbw to Scott Styris. The Lightning were finally all out for 141 and Middlesex completed their second win in two matches. All eleven bowlers used in the match got at least one wicket, but the most prolific wicket-taker, Kyle Hogg, also conceded the most runs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{purchase}} of AMC {{was instrumental in}} reviving Chrysler. According to Robert Lutz, former President of Chrysler, the AMC acquisition was a big and risky undertaking. The purchase was part of Chrysler's strategic [...] "retreat-cum-diversification" [...] plan that he states {{did not have the}} right focus. Initially the goal was to obtain the world-renowned Jeep brand. However, Lutz discovered that the decision to buy AMC {{turned out to be a}} gold mine for Chrysler. At that time, Chrysler's management was attempting to find a model to improve structure and operations, [...] "something that would help get our minds <b>unstuck</b> and thinking beyond the old paradigms that we were so familiar with". In this transformation, [...] "Chrysler's acquisition of AMC was one of the all-time great moments in corporate serendipity" [...] according to Lutz [...] "that most definitely played a key role in demonstrating how to accomplish change".|$|E
2500|$|On September 4, {{a devastating}} {{nighttime}} air raid struck a riverbank only 7 kilometres {{to the southwest}} of Kunduz. Taliban militants had hijacked civilian supply trucks with gasoline on a nearby road. After an attempt to bring the heavy vehicles across the Kunduz river had failed, the insurgents sent for nearby villagers to come and help unload the fuel. The German command center {{was aware of the}} incident, readied a quick reaction force and sent for close air support. Unbeknownst to them a considerable number of civilians had mixed with the insurgents and militant supporters in order to come by a free gallon of fuel. Fearing a truck bomb attack could be imminent if the trucks came <b>unstuck,</b> a German commander ordered a pair of American F-15s to attack the scene with bombs. A later German investigation concluded the attack caused up to 142 deaths, including an unknown amount of civilians.|$|E
2500|$|In 1963, the Ngô family's grip {{on power}} became <b>unstuck</b> during the Buddhist crisis, {{during which the}} nation's Buddhist {{majority}} rose up against the pro-Catholic regime. Nhu tried to break the Buddhists' opposition by using the Special Forces in raids on prominent Buddhist temples that left hundreds dead, and framing the regular army for it. However, Nhu's plan was uncovered, which intensified plots by military officers, encouraged by the Americans, who turned against the Ngô family after the pagoda attacks. Nhu {{was aware of the}} plots, but remained confident he could outmaneuver them, and began to plot a counter-coup, as well as the assassinations of US Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. and other American and opposition figures. Nhu was fooled by the loyalist General Tôn Thất Đính, who had turned against the Ngô family. On 1 November 1963, the coup proceeded, and the Ngô brothers (Nhu and Diệm) were detained and assassinated the next day.|$|E
2500|$|On {{receiving}} the third order to scatter on 4 July 1942, RNVR T/Lt Leo Gradwell commanding the ASW adapted [...] Middlesbrough-built trawler HMS Ayrshire (FY 225), concluded {{that as he}} was heading north to the Arctic ice shelf, nothing prevented him from escorting merchantmen. Leading his convoy of Ayrshire and three US merchant vessels, the Panamanian-registered Troubador, Ironclad and Silver Sword, he proceeded north, using only a sextant and The Times World Geographic Pocket Book. On reaching the Arctic ice pack, the convoy stuck fast and so the ships stopped engines and then banked their fires. Gradwell arranged a defence, formulated around the fact that Troubador was carrying a cargo of bunkering coal and drums of white paint: the crews painted all the vessels white; covered decks with white linen; and arranged the Sherman tanks on the merchant vessels decks into a defensive formation, with loaded main guns. After a period of waiting and having evaded Luftwaffe reconnaissance aircraft, finding themselves <b>unstuck,</b> they proceeded to the Matochkin Strait. They were found there by a flotilla of corvettes, who escorted the four-ship convoy plus two other merchant vessels to the Russian port of Archangel, arriving on 25 July. Gradwell was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross on 15 September 1942.|$|E
2500|$|As of 2004, the {{marketing}} mascots are a care-free Jamaican cinnamon stick named CinnaMon and an accident-prone apple named Bad Apple. Labeled as Apple Jacks Adventures in print advertising, the commercials focus on CinnaMon upstaging Bad Apple by reaching {{a bowl of}} Apple Jacks before he can, {{in spite of the}} apple's attempts to stop him. Bad Apple's antagonistic nature was latter dropped; Apple and CinnaMon were then portrayed as highly competitive friends, both getting into the bowl. The campaign was slated to be retired in 2007, and replaced by a retread of the 1990s campaign focused on children, but fan response to Apple and CinnaMon helped them remain as the mascots. [...] In 2007, Apple and Cinnamon were fused together with Cinnamon sticking through the center of Apple with both of their legs at the bottom of their body. [...] They remained this way for a few of the commercials until they became <b>unstuck</b> by a special machine. In 2009, Apple and Cinnamon were transported out of their cartoon world to the real world of New York City, where they continue to race each other to the bowl where they would enter the bowl at the same time. In 2010 Kellogg planned to have Apple and Cinnamon race across the country to see who would enter the bowl first, but the production team saw no real need to change their New York City commercial.|$|E

A 2–1 win for Prato over Como saw them progress to the second round, but the Tuscan side came <b>unstuck</b> the following week, succumbing 3–2 to Grosseto. Grosseto travelled to Parma for the tie on 21 August, but were soundly beaten 4–1.

Francesco Modesto on the other flank then delivered a cross for Graziano Pellè to see Parma double their lead with half an hour to go. Hernán Crespo then scored two goals in the last ten minutes as a substitute, his goals bisected by a Gabriel Paletta own goal, as Franco Colomba's 100% record at the Tardini remained intact and Parma completed their fourth victory in a row on home soil {{for the first time since}} April and May 2007 under Claudio Ranieri, although the team did fail to keep a clean sheet in a home Coppa Italia match on the twelfth [...] consecutive occasion in a run which extended back to 10 May 2002 when they overcame Juventus 1–0.|$|E
