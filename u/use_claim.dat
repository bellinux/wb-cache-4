Proponents of their <b>use</b> <b>claim</b> many benefits, however when the evidence is critically examined in systematic reviews of the topic, it is reported that there is insufficient evidence to show that occlusal splints are effective for sleep bruxism. Furthermore, occlusal splints are probably ineffective for awake bruxism, since they tend to be worn only during sleep. However, occlusal splints may be of some benefit in reducing the tooth wear that may accompany bruxism, but by mechanically protecting the teeth rather than reducing the bruxing activity itself. In a minority of cases, sleep bruxism may be made worse by an occlusal splint. Some patients will periodically return with splints with holes worn through them, either because the bruxism is aggravated, or unaffected by the presence of the splint. When tooth-to-tooth contact is possible through the holes in a splint, it is offering no protection against tooth wear and needs to be replaced.|$|E

40|$|One dilemma {{with health}} claims {{is that too}} much {{information}} can confuse consumers and too little information can mislead them. Instead of using only {{one side of the}} package, a laboratory study is used to examine the effectiveness of various front-sided health claims when used in combination with a full health claim on the back panel. The results indicate that the presence of a short health claim on the front label generates more specific attribute-related thoughts, more inferences, and creates a more believable and positive image of the product in the consumers ’ mind than does a longer health claim on the front label. This article concludes with a discussion of how labeling information needs to be presented to effectively allow consumers to understand and <b>use</b> <b>claim</b> information. 1 How Consumers Interpret Two-Sided Health Claims During the FDA’s consideration of a soy health claim, an important issue was how this claim should be worded on the label. While some believed a longer, more complete health claim would be most accurate, others believed a shorter claim would be better understood. The concerns over FDA claims being accurate but misunderstood is not without support. While the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA) was intended to make food labels more useful and informative for consumers, it is often found that consumers neither use nor comprehend nutrition information in their food purchase decisions (Szykman et al. 1997). Many consumers are skeptical of health claims, and they believe they are incomplete, stress trivial differences among products, and are misleading in other ways (Silverglad...|$|E

Since television becomes a part of children?s life, the writer chooses advertisements on television {{as the source of}} this study. This study is about the language claim on children advertisements. A claim usually shows the superiority of the product by using clever vocabulary to manipulate the consumers. Therefore, consumers should pay attention and carefully to the claim so they will not misunderstanding about the product. Moreover, the writer would like to identify the claims used on children advertisements, and also the claims that mostly used on the children advertisements. The data is analyzed employing the theories written by Schrank, (1998) which on the book titled "Exploring language". He has classified the kinds of claim into ten categories. For supporting the theory, the writer used Lutz?s theory, where he classified the words that are used for Weasel Claim. Descriptive quantitative approach is used in this study. Findings show that Weasel claim is the most frequently <b>use</b> <b>claim</b> on children advertisement because perhaps, children can understand the words such as help, can be, work, etc, easily. Furthermore, "can be" is used the most among the weasel claim.

40|$|Property and {{casualty}} actuaries are professional {{experts in}} the economic assessment of uncertain events related to non-life insurance products (e. g. fire, liability or motor insurance). For {{the construction of a}} fair and reasonable tariff associated with the risks in their portfolio, actuaries have many statistical techniques in their toolbox. In this paper tools for the pricing of multivariate risks are considered. Examples of situations where this problem occurs are numerous; e. g. workers’ compensation schemes where the insurer has information on accidents occurring ‘at work’ as well as ‘not at work’, policyholders having policies in multiple lines of business (e. g. flood, theft etc.) at the same company, or policyholders holding multiple contracts e. g. in a motor insurance context. The latter is the situation we will explore in this paper, using a data set from a European insurance company. The combination of a priori rating (through risk classification based on a priori measurable characteristics) and a posteriori rating is considered. A posteriori the claim experience of a policyholder is taken into account. In a multivariate context the pricing actuary should be able to <b>use</b> <b>claim</b> history from all business lines or risk components a policyholder is holding within the company. Intuitively, the number of claims a policyholder has reported on a particular business line or risk component reveals his general risk proneness and is as such relevant when pricing other lines or components. In contrast to the analytical approaches developed for multivariate experience rating in the literature, our approach is data-driven using Bayesian statistics. Empirical evidence has been found of positive dependence between different contracts belonging to the same policy holder, which is an intuitively appealing result. Focus is on applications of the multivariate Bayesian experience rating, as well as on graphical representations of the results...|$|E
40|$|In {{modern times}} the {{over-riding}} {{policy of the}} international {{law of the sea}} is commonly regarded as that of establishing and maintaining a public order in the shared use of, and shared competence over, the oceans, appropriately balancing the inclusive interests of all states and the unique, exclusive interests of particular states in the greatest production of values for all mankind. The broad outlines of both the highest level complementary principles and the more detailed specific prescriptions, embodying such contraposed inclusive and exclusive interests, by which the authoritative decision-makers of the general community seek to secure such economic balance, are the common knowledge both of scholarly observers and of participants in the processes of <b>use,</b> <b>claim,</b> and decision by which the oceans are exploited and regulated. The necessity, in the rational application of broad principles and detailed prescriptions, for a comprehensive, informed, and contextual approach, considering every specific problem in terms of all the factors in the context relevant to rational choice between alternatives in decision, seems, however, to have achieved somewhat less recognition. Thus, while officials and scholarly observers frequently appear to concur upon the general inclusive and exclusive interests at stake in particular problems, they also commonly appear either to neglect entirely the specific factors uniquely revelant to particular policy problems or to attempt to reach decision without adequate investigation of the appropriate weight to be accorded the relevant factors. Efforts to resolve the perennial problem of the permissible width of the territorial sea, which has recently provoked a spate of the most diverse and potentially harmful claims and has thus far proved refractory to explicit multilateral agreement, seem notably to have been affected by a disregard of certain special environmental factors particularly relevant to a rational policy choice. Because of the great importance of this problem to the whole public order of the oceans, it may not be inappropriate to suggest both a brief examination of the general context which establishes the importance of the problem and a more comprehensive, detailed scrutiny of the special factors which ought {{to be taken into account}} by decision makers...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT What is Transformative? An Explanatory Synthesis of the Convergence of Transformation and Predominant Purpose in Copyright Fair Use Law The {{transformative}} {{test has}} risen {{to the top of}} the agenda of the copyright academic community with no less than two major studies of copyright fair use and the impact of the transformative test released in 2011 by Professors Matthew Sag and Neil Netanel that follow up on three recent comprehensive studies of copyright fair use published since 2008. The lessons learned from these two 2011 statistical studies are significant, in that both studies confirm the importance of the transformative test in terms of its application by the courts as the dominant test of fair use and in the observation that a finding of transformation in a copyright fair <b>use</b> <b>claim</b> virtually assures a finding that the use is fair. Nevertheless, the two studies and those that preceded them have not made an empirical study of the entire body of appellate law on transformation with the specific intent of demonstrating the meaning and operation of the term “transformative”—in other words, how the term works—illustrated by a synthesis of the data set of appellate cases. This article seeks to address that need. This article analyzes the entire body of United States Supreme Court and United States Courts of Appeals case law applying the transformative test in copyright fair uses cases to present two points: first, that the transformative test modifies the first sentence (sometimes referred to as the preamble) of 17 U. S. C. § 107 —in particular, the terms, “the fair use of a copyrighted work”—rather than simply factor one of the four factor test. Second, the implementation of the transformative test by the courts indicates that the courts are to consider transformations in the content, context, and the predominant purpose of the original work and whether the alleged fair use changes the content, context, or predominant purpose in a manner that furthers the public policies reflected in the first sentence of section 107, namely the furtherance of the progress of the arts and the promotion of the creation of new, original expression. The transformative test has changed copyright law, and it has become the defining standard for fair use. My conclusions are that the data set of cases applying the transformative test to concrete legal situations producing final judgments in the cases highlights the importance of a change in the predominant purpose of the work rather than simply a change in the character (the form, the contents) of the work. It is evident from the record of cases that the courts take the “purpose” part of the analysis very seriously, for all of the approved fair uses in the appellate cases involved a change in the predominant purpose for the use of the work. Even if the works were not changed in form, function, or genre, the fair use works were transformed in predominant purpose either through alteration of the contents, or recontextualization of the copied material, or by the addition of significant creative expression so that the predominant purpose of the new work was significantly different from the original work. Non-alteration of the contents and expression of artistic and literary works still can be justified as fair use, but the function and purpose of the original works must be changed in the second works in a manner that fulfills fair use objectives that promote the progress of the arts and the creation of new, original expression that benefits the public, namely through research, comment and criticism, educational, archival, or historical-referential uses. Copyright law seeks first to promote new, original expression in the arts and literature, and second to allow other public interest activities such as education, research, archiving, news reporting, and comment and criticism of existing works. Transformation requires the copier to fulfill these objectives. The duplication of works just to show off their same creative, artistic, or literary virtues in a new time, a new place, a new mode or medium of communication, or for a new audience does not fulfill the goals of copyright. No new and original expression results from simple replication of the same communication and expression found in the original. The derivative works doctrine gives those rights to the original author or artist, not to the public at large. The lessons of the transformative test for those engaged in creative, artistic, or literary pursuits may be summed up in the following: if you copy an original work, use it for a different purpose than the purpose for which the original work was created. Modify the contents, function, and meaning of the original work through alteration of the original expression or the addition of significant new expression. Otherwise, you are making an unauthorized exploitation of the creative expression of the work for exactly the same reasons and purposes that the original author or artist created the work, and you are depriving the original author or artist of the derivative works right guaranteed by copyright...|$|E
