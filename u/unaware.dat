5|$|Keith David as John Garnett, Erin's {{father and}} Esquire's acquaintance. He is <b>unaware</b> {{of the fact}} that Esquire is lying about who he really is.|$|E
5|$|When {{discussing}} {{her approach}} to portray Valerie Davis, Duplaix stated {{that she was}} <b>unaware</b> that her character was secretly Vincent's split personality. Echoing Jeanmarie's comments, the actress confirmed that the show's cast were purposefully kept <b>unaware</b> of their characters' future storylines until they were given the final copies of the scripts. Duplaix played the role from December 16, 2004 to May 28, 2008; Siena Goines temporarily played the character from January 20, 2007 to March 29, 2007 while Duplaix was on maternity leave.|$|E
5|$|A mutant who can freeze {{objects and}} create ice. His family is <b>unaware</b> {{that he is}} a mutant and simply {{believes}} he is at a boarding school. After returning home, Bobby reveals to them what he actually is, much to his brother's derision. He is also Rogue's boyfriend.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} almost-collisions in 2005 in similar {{circumstances}} {{in the tunnel}} between Foggy Bottom and Rosslyn stations led to a new test procedure which would have identified the faulty circuit after installation. However, by 2009, Metro engineers were <b>unaware</b> of this incident or the tests developed to detect the failure condition.|$|E
5|$|After being summoned, Scar conspires with Janja, Ushari and a {{crocodile}} named Kiburi {{to defeat the}} Lion Guard (who are currently <b>unaware</b> of Scar's return) and Simba. Scar is voiced by David Oyelowo.|$|E
5|$|During the luau/inventory, Jan {{arrives at}} the office to speak with Michael in private. Michael is terrified that Jan is there to confront him over the widely spread photo, but she appears to be <b>unaware</b> of it, instead confessing her {{attraction}} to him against all reason.|$|E
5|$|Epidemiological {{studies of}} {{serotonin}} syndrome are difficult as many physicians are <b>unaware</b> of the diagnosis {{or they may}} miss the syndrome due to its variable manifestations. In 1998 a survey conducted in England found that 85% of the general practitioners that had prescribed the antidepressant nefazodone were <b>unaware</b> of serotonin syndrome. The incidence may be increasing as {{a larger number of}} pro-serotonergic drugs (drugs which increase serotonin levels) are now being used in clinical practice. One postmarketing surveillance study identified an incidence of 0.4 cases per 1000 patient-months for patients who were taking nefazodone. Additionally, around 14 to 16 percent of persons who overdose on SSRIs are thought to develop serotonin syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Finley & Figg {{are still}} blissfully <b>unaware</b> {{of the storm}} ahead of them. With a large {{settlement}} seemingly looming, Oscar hastens to start divorce proceedings against his wife, Paula, with whom had long been at odds, so as to cash out before the big Krayoxx money comes in.|$|E
5|$|Hanneman died {{of liver}} failure on May 2, 2013, in a Southern California {{hospital}} near his home. On May 9, 2013, the official {{cause of death}} was announced as alcohol-related cirrhosis. Hanneman and his family had apparently been <b>unaware</b> of the extent of the condition until shortly before his death.|$|E
5|$|Hardboiled had no {{specific}} {{goal for the}} Allies, other than to convince the Germans of an imminent invasion threat against Norway. Clarke had already established that deception operations should have {{a clear idea of}} what the enemy was supposed to do (rather than what they were expected to think). Stanley was <b>unaware</b> of this, not being in communication with Clarke's department in Cairo. As a result, the objective for Hardboiled was chosen because the resources existed and it would not affect real future operations (planners had already rejected Norway as a viable target), rather than for any strategic advantage it brought the Allies. Stanley was also <b>unaware</b> of the extensive double agent network {{under the control of the}} Twenty Committee, having merely been told that MI5 had an avenue through which to pass information to the enemy.|$|E
5|$|Houston {{learned of}} the Goliad {{massacre}} on April 3. <b>Unaware</b> that Secretary of War Rusk was already en route to Groce's with orders from President Burnet to halt the army's retreat and engage the enemy, he relayed the Goliad news by letter to Rusk.|$|E
5|$|If all of {{the loyalty}} {{missions}} have not been completed, an alternate ending out plays out, which sees the Saints make plans to take over more planets, <b>unaware</b> {{of their ability to}} use the technology.|$|E
5|$|In February 2012, BBC Sport {{reported}} that the Football Association of Wales were investigating his eligibility, but Hooper was <b>unaware</b> of having any Welsh ancestry. Hooper declared his desire to play for Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Olympics, but was not selected.|$|E
5|$|It possessed two {{advantages}} {{over the use}} of DCs; no pre-setting of depth was required, and the enemy was <b>unaware</b> of the attack if no hits were made.|$|E
5|$|Lack of publicity: without {{coverage}} by television or popular publications, {{many people are}} <b>unaware</b> that gliding is even a sport. Without this knowledge the public may have a poor understanding of how flying without an engine is possible and safe.|$|E
5|$|Larry Ball and Doug Swift of the undefeated 1972 Miami Dolphins team. Swift {{was left}} {{unprotected}} by the Dolphins, and the Buccaneers drafted him, <b>unaware</b> {{of the previous}} day’s newspaper report that Swift had been accepted into medical school and would be retiring from football.|$|E
5|$|Many HIV-positive {{people are}} <b>unaware</b> {{that they are}} {{infected}} with the virus. For example, in 2001 less than 1% of the sexually active urban population in Africa had been tested, and this proportion is even lower in rural populations. Furthermore, in 2001 only 0.5% of pregnant women attending urban health facilities were counselled, tested or receive their test results. Again, this proportion is even lower in rural health facilities. Since donors may therefore be <b>unaware</b> of their infection, donor blood and blood products used in medicine and medical research are routinely screened for HIV.|$|E
5|$|Side {{effects of}} {{midazolam}} {{in the elderly}} are listed above. People experiencing amnesia as {{a side effect of}} midazolam are generally <b>unaware</b> their memory is impaired, unless they had previously known it as a side effect.|$|E
5|$|The Americans {{were still}} <b>unaware</b> {{that this was}} not the main British attack, in part due to the ferocity of the {{fighting}} and the number of British troops engaged.|$|E
5|$|The French {{intended}} to deport Long to French Guiana, but {{the outbreak of}} World War I in 1914 interrupted their plans. As a result, Long remained in Saigon Central Prison, serving his life sentence with hard labour. The French were <b>unaware</b> that Long was still in contact with his supporters.|$|E
5|$|The Fringe team discovers a Triad {{gang member}} and ties to several shell {{companies}} the gang {{has set up}} in the US. They interview Elizabeth Jarvis (Ingrid Torrance), one of the companies' large investors, but she seems <b>unaware</b> of her investment's criminal background. While at her house, Peter (Joshua Jackson) observes signs of obsessive compulsive and germaphobe characteristics such as large quantities of hand sanitizer. Walter informs him the worm has a medicinal purpose, not a narcotic one as they previously believed. These two discoveries lead Peter and Olivia (Anna Torv) back to Jarvis' house, and they learn that her son (Colby Paul) has an immunodeficiency disorder. To allow him {{to be able to go}} outside, his mother and doctor have been giving him an injection to his spleen once a month, though he is <b>unaware</b> of the medicine's origins.|$|E
5|$|The LCS also lacked {{knowledge}} of MI5's Double-Cross System and its double agents. The department were <b>unaware</b> that no uncontrolled German operatives {{were active in}} the UK, and so incorrectly believed any deception {{would have to be}} highly realistic to appear genuine.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish Crown was <b>unaware</b> that, at the time, the United States had {{successfully}} infiltrated the island {{with a number}} of spies, among them Henry Howard Whitney, Henry Ward, George Bronson Brea, William Freeman, James Dewel, Frederick Ober and Edwin Emerson, Jr.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{authorities}} were <b>unaware</b> of the cofradías existence until 1840. However, {{as early as}} 1833, Filipino priests have noticed their activities {{in the vicinity of}} Mount San Cristobal and Mount Banahaw.|$|E
5|$|The loyalists were <b>unaware</b> that Đính's real {{intention}} was to engulf Saigon with his rebel divisions and lock Tung's loyalists in the countryside where they could not defend the president. Tung and the palace agreed to send all four Saigon-based special forces companies out of the capital of Saigon on 29 October 1963.|$|E
5|$|There is no need, under Churchill v Walton, to {{show that}} the conspirators knew that their {{proposed}} course of conduct amounted to a crime, but they must have intended the consequences; if two people conspire to put poison in the victim's tea, this is not a conspiracy to murder unless the poison was intended to kill the victim. The defendants will similarly not be found guilty if they are <b>unaware</b> that a crime will result; if two people agree to grow plants, <b>unaware</b> that the plants are illegal, they have not engaged in a conspiracy. On the other hand, if the two people believe the plants to be illegal even though they are not, they could be found guilty.|$|E
5|$|This contradicted Wright's earlier {{statement}} when stopped by {{police in the}} district {{in the early hours}} of the morning: he implied he was <b>unaware</b> he was in the red light district and was driving around because he could not sleep. Wright's rented flat was located in the red light area.|$|E
5|$|To deter pursuits of marching {{infantry}} or riding cavalry, the Han Chinese made caltrops (barbed iron balls {{with sharp}} spikes sticking {{out in all}} directions) that could be scattered {{on the ground and}} pierce the feet or hooves of those who were <b>unaware</b> of them.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked about}} the {{popularity}} of the band's MySpace site in an interview with Prefix Magazine, the band said that they were <b>unaware</b> what it was, and that the site had originally been created by their fans.|$|E
5|$|While traveling, Weed {{meets his}} other brother, Joe. First Joe dislikes Gin for leaving Sakura {{unattended}} in the Alps. He is <b>unaware</b> that Sakura had left Ōu under the false impression that Gin was dead, and that Gin had been <b>unaware</b> of Sakura's leaving. Joe explains {{that a large}} hybrid bear has attacked and killed his mate, Hitomi. Weed's group joins Joe to defeat the animal. During the battle, GB dies saving Weed, and Weed vows to avenge him. Weed knocks himself and the bear into a river. The bear dies after hitting a floodgate and Weed manages to survive. He returns to Ōu and learns that his mate, Koyuki, is pregnant. Weeks later, she gives birth to four pups.|$|E
5|$|Đôn {{and other}} {{officers}} were stunned when the corpses arrived at JGS headquarters. Đôn confronted Minh in his office, {{and while they}} were remonstrating, Xuân entered the room. <b>Unaware</b> of Đôn's presence, Xuân snapped to attention and stated in French, “Mission accomplie”. Despite Đôn's investigation, no one was ever charged with the killings.|$|E
5|$|A Covenant army {{attacks the}} academy causing {{confusion}} and panic. Although not made clear in Forward Unto Dawn, the Covenant are a theocratic collection of alien {{species that are}} religiously offended by Humanity and seek to eradicate it. The events portrayed in Forward Unto Dawn {{are some of the}} earliest encounters with the Covenant, and the characters other than Master Chief were <b>unaware</b> of their existence.|$|E
5|$|A poll on {{the issue}} of Scottish {{independence}} conducted by TNS-BMRB in December 2013 gave Lamont an approval rating of 6% among women and 8% among men, compared with 22% and 30% respectively for Salmond. 41% of respondents to that survey were <b>unaware</b> of her role as Scottish Labour leader, a figure rising to 62% among those aged 16–34.|$|E
5|$|A primary {{spontaneous}} pneumothorax (PSP) tends {{to occur in}} a young adult without underlying lung problems, and usually causes limited symptoms. Chest pain and sometimes mild breathlessness are the usual predominant presenting features. People who are affected by PSPs are often <b>unaware</b> of potential danger and may wait several days before seeking medical attention. PSPs more commonly occur during changes in atmospheric pressure, explaining to some extent why episodes of pneumothorax may happen in clusters. It is rare for PSPs to cause tension pneumothoraces.|$|E
5|$|A {{researcher}} {{examining the}} skeleton identifies {{it as the}} missing victim from 1933. However, {{there seems to be}} no substantial evidence proving that Tooms was the murderer. Scully relieves Mulder, who is watching Tooms' new residence; they are <b>unaware</b> that Tooms is hiding in the trunk of Mulder's car. He manages to break into Mulder's apartment, where he injures himself and imprints Mulder's shoe print on his face. Tooms' frameup leads the police to question Mulder. Skinner then forbids Mulder from contacting Tooms.|$|E
