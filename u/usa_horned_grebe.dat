Other similarly sized grebes are very distinct in plumage, i.e. the eared <b>grebe</b> and <b>horned</b> <b>grebe.</b> Both species bear much more colorful breeding plumage, with rufous sides, golden crests {{along the side of the}} head against contrasting slaty color (also a rufous neck in the horned); while in winter, both the eared and horned grebes are pied with slaty and cream color and have red eyes.|$|R
50|$|The {{conservation}} order aims {{to preserve}} and reinstate the sea region's function as a feeding, over-wintering, moulting, migration and rest area for the species living there, especially for red-throated loon (Gavia stellata), black-throated loon (Gavia arctica), <b>horned</b> <b>grebe</b> (Podiceps auritus), little gull (Larus minutus), common tern (Sterna hirundo), Arctic tern (Sterna paradisaea), red-necked grebe (Podiceps grisegena), long-tailed duck (Clangula hyernalis), scoter (Melanitta nigra), velvet scoter (Melanitta fusca), common gull (Larus canus), lesser black-backed gull (Larus fiscus), guillemot (Uria aalge), razorbill (Alca torda) and black guillemot (Cepphus grylle).|$|R
40|$|Wetlands of the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) provide {{important}} breeding habitat for greater than 30 species of waterbirds. Approximately 70 % of PPR wetlands {{have been lost}} since European settlement and remaining wetlands are subjected to frequent degradation, primarily due to agricultural activities. Horned grebes (Podiceps auritus) are experiencing long-term population declines and are listed as a species of Special Concern in Canada. Because {{there is virtually no}} information on the status and trends of pied-billed grebes (Podilymbus podicep) this species is also of considerable conservation concern. Grebes are recorded on the Waterfowl Breeding Population and Habitat Surveys (WBPHS) conducted annually in May by the Canadian Wildlife Service; however, how accurately these counts reflect actual abundance has been unknown. Using a repeated counts method in 2010 and 2011, estimates of detection probabilities averaged 0. 48 and 0. 18 for horned and pied-billed grebes, respectively. These results suggest that WBPHS ground surveys may be used as an efficient and effective management tool for monitoring <b>horned</b> <b>grebe</b> abundances. However, low detection rates for pied-billed grebes lend little support for including the species in future monitoring efforts using the WBPHS. I recommend that the Canadian Wildlife Service consider implementing standardized ground survey methods to facilitate annual monitoring of <b>horned</b> <b>grebe</b> abundances. Marshbird research has focused primarily on breeding habitat use or selection but has seldom examined how productivity is related to wetland characteristics. Understanding processes that affect distribution patterns and productivity of grebes could provide insights into actions needed to achieve conservation goals. Therefore, occupancy of wetlands by breeding and brood-rearing horned and pied-billed grebes was evaluated on 6 - 7 study sites (5. 8 - 11. 6 km 2) in south-central Saskatchewan, 2010 and 2011, and related to wetland and upland habitat features. Wetland occupancy by grebes was influenced by interspecific competition as well as local and landscape-level wetland features. Horned and pied-billed grebes rarely co-occurred on smaller (≤ 4 ha) semi-permanent and permanent wetlands. At the wetland level, <b>horned</b> <b>grebe</b> occupancy and productivity were highly correlated with the amount of emergent vegetation, whereas wetland area alone was a better predictor of adult pied-billed grebe occupancy and productivity. At a landscape level, the number of semi-permanent, permanent, and artificial wetlands on each study site was an important predictor of breeding and brood-rearing wetland occupancy probability for horned grebes in 2010 and for pied-billed grebes in both years. However, breeding <b>horned</b> <b>grebe</b> occupancy probability and productivity were higher in low wetland density landscapes in 2011. Horned grebes may be opportunistic, exploiting more of the available wetland habitats in low wetland density landscapes during years of above-average water conditions. Conservation initiatives for grebes should consider the roles of wetland-specific and landscape-level features while protecting semi-permanent and permanent wetlands in landscapes characterized by both high and low wetland densities...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>horned</b> <b>grebe</b> or Slavonian grebe (Podiceps auritus) is a {{relatively}} small waterbird in the family Podicipedidae. There are two known subspecies; (P. a. auritus), which breeds in Eurasia, and (P. a. cornutus), which breeds in North America. [...] In Eurasia, the subspecies is distributed over most of northern Europe and Asia, breeding from Greenland to western China. The North American subspecies spans most of Canada {{and some of the}} United States. Both subspecies appear physically similar and get their name from large patches of yellowish feathers, called “horns”, located behind the eyes that can raise and lower at will.|$|R
5|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} by Carl Ludwig Hablitz in 1783 as Colymbus caspicus, from {{a bird in}} Bandar-e Anzali. This was originally {{thought to be a}} synonym for the <b>horned</b> <b>grebe,</b> until Erwin Stresemann discovered that the description applied more to the black-necked grebe in 1948. Before this, the earliest description was thought to be by Christian Ludwig Brehm in 1831, who gave this bird its current scientific name of Podiceps nigricollis from a German bird. To resolve this, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature suppressed the name C. caspicus. The genus name Dytes is sometimes used for this species, a placement which was formalized by Robert Ridgway in 1881.|$|R
40|$|All {{species of}} loons, grebes, and auks are monogamous, with adults forming strong pair bonds that are {{established}} or reestablished each year, probably {{during the spring}} prenesting period. The extent of remating by birds mated the previous year in these groups is still largely undocumented, though at least in alcids it is fairly high, given the relatively long life-spans and the tendencies of the birds to return year after year to essentially the same territory and sometimes to the same nest site. Such conditions would promote reestablishment of contracts between previously paired birds, since it is not believed that in these birds pair or family units normally remain intact through the winter. Although in some grebes such as the <b>horned</b> <b>grebe</b> breeding site tenacity and mate fidelity may be very strong, in others such as the colonial-nesting eared grebe, {{there is no evidence}} of this and mate fidelity is poorly developed...|$|R
50|$|The winter plumage of the {{red-necked grebe}} is duskier {{than that of}} other grebes; its dark grey cap is less defined, and merges into the grey face, and a pale {{crescent}} that curves around {{the rear of the}} face contrasts {{with the rest of the}} head. The front of the neck is whitish or light grey, the hind neck is darker grey, and the yellow of the bill is less obvious than in summer. Although the red-necked grebe is unmistakable in breeding plumage, it is less distinctive in winter and can be confused with similar species. It is larger than the Slavonian (<b>horned)</b> <b>grebe,</b> with a relatively larger bill and a grey, rather than white face. It is closer in size to the Eurasian great crested grebe, but that species is longer-necked, has a more contrasting head pattern, and always shows white above the eye.|$|R

50|$|Government Island is a 1760 acre {{island in}} the Columbia River north of Portland, in Multnomah County, in the U.S. state of Oregon. Though Interstate 205 passes over it on the Glenn L. Jackson Memorial Bridge, access to the island is only by boat. There is a city {{controlled}} locked gate in the 205 fence. Government Island {{is known for its}} great blue heron colony and the Government Island State Recreation Area (primitive camping, beaches). The interior of the island, off limits to the public, contains a seasonal cattle ranch and protected natural areas, including Jewit Lake. There are also remnants of old pioneer buildings on the island. Camping is permitted below the vegetation line around the perimeter, and picnic tables and restrooms can be found in these areas as well. Many threatened or endangered wildlife species live on the island, including red-legged frog, pileated woodpecker, little willow flycatcher, olive-sided flycatcher, western meadowlark, <b>horned</b> <b>grebe,</b> red-necked grebe, bufflehead, purple martin, and possibly the endangered Columbian white-tailed deer.|$|R
5000|$|McCormick Island {{regularly}} supports {{thousands of}} waterfowl during the migratory season, {{such as the}} common loon, <b>horned</b> <b>grebe,</b> red-breasted merganser, lesser scaup, and bufflehead. [...] McCormick Island also represents the highest concentration of wading birds in Pennsylvania during the breeding season including the great egret, yellow-crowned night-heron and black-crowned night-heron. The island also provides important breeding habitat for the black-crowned night-heron, which is classified as a candidate- at risk species in Pennsylvania and under consideration for Pennsylvania endangered species status. Thus McCormick Island is declared an Important Bird Area (IBA) by The National Audubon Society. Any disturbance on the island could possibly impact the bird habitat. McCormick Island provides a great avian habitat because of the forested wetland complex and shallow foraging areas, and open water. Typically, the main birds spotted on McCormick Island are: great blue heron, green back heron, black-crown night heron, egrets, and bald eagles. Non avian species documented on the island include river otter, beaver, muskrat, snapping turtle, yellow-bellied slider turtle, map turtle and water snake. American toad populations are abundant on the islands.|$|R

40|$|The <b>horned</b> <b>grebe</b> (Podiceps auritus) {{population}} of the Magdalen Islands in the St. Lawrence Gulf (Québec, Canada) has declined sharply over the last decades. It is the only breeding {{population of}} this species in eastern North America with nearest breeding populations being> 2500 km apart in western North America and Europe, We used three types of genetic markers: mitochondrial (mt) DNA ND 2 sequence, a-enolase intron sequence, and 25 amplified fragment length polymorphism loci (AFLPs) to quantify the genetic diversity within the Magdalen Island population and to assess its genetic distinc-tiveness relative to populations from western Canada (five sites) and Iceland (one site). The Magdalen Island population retained a comparable amount of genetic diversity to the average diversity observed across all populations in all three markers. Horned grebe mtDNA sequences formed a monophyletic group and nearly all haplotypes present in Québec were found elsewhere. In the ND 2 fragment, popu-lations partitioned into two groups corresponding to subspecies (Iceland versus North American sites) and more strongly in three groups according to geographic disjunctions (Iceland versus Québec versus western Canada). In contrast, {{there was no evidence}} of structure between sites in the a-enolase intron. In the AFLPs, Iceland showed the greatest level of differentiation, followed by the Québec and British Columbia populations. For conservation purposes, we suggest that the Magdalen Islands population should be recognized as a separate unit...|$|R
