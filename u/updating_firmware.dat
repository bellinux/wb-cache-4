5000|$|The BIOS may be [...] "manually" [...] updated by a user, {{using a small}} utility program. In contrast, {{firmware}} {{in storage}} devices (harddisks, DVD drives, flash storage) rarely gets updated, even when flash (rather than ROM) storage {{is used for the}} firmware; there are no standardized mechanisms for detecting or <b>updating</b> <b>firmware</b> versions.|$|E
50|$|The target's JTAG {{interface}} is accessed {{using some}} JTAG-enabled application and some JTAG adapter hardware. There {{is a wide}} range of such hardware, optimized for purposes such as production testing, debugging high speed systems, low cost microcontroller development, and so on. In the same way, the software used to drive such hardware can be quite varied. Software developers mostly use JTAG for debugging and <b>updating</b> <b>firmware.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Olympus Master {{software}} {{provides the}} ability to upgrade the firmware of the users Olympus digital camera when it {{is linked to the}} computer via the USB cable. Olympus compact digital cameras, Olympus digital SLRs (E-System cameras), Olympus Zuiko Digital lenses and Olympus flash units are supported. This method is the only way of <b>updating</b> <b>firmware</b> within Olympus equipment. Many other manufacturers such as Nikon and Canon use a different method, which allows the user to temporarily save a patch file to a memory card. Once the user has placed the memory card into the camera they wish to update, the camera will install the new firmware directly from the memory card. Both methods have their advantages, as well as their disadvantages.|$|E

Through this transaction, Funai will acquire the capabilities to develop, manufacture and sell inkjet hardware as well as inkjet supplies. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions {{and is expected to}} close within the first half of 2013. However, in the year 2015 they started the process of analyzing printers and its firmware. As of 2015-2016 year, Kodak {{is now one of the}} many projects Funai service corporation has taken on. From refurbishing printers to <b>updating</b> <b>firmware</b> on new printers and even selling the ink jet cartridges.|$|E
50|$|Firmware {{is held in}} {{non-volatile}} memory devices such as ROM, EPROM, or flash memory. Changing the firmware of a device may rarely or never be done during its lifetime; some firmware memory devices are permanently installed and cannot be changed after manufacture. Common reasons for <b>updating</b> <b>firmware</b> include fixing bugs or adding features to the device. This may require ROM integrated circuits to be physically replaced, or flash memory to be reprogrammed through a special procedure. Firmware such as the ROM BIOS of a personal computer may contain only elementary basic functions of a device and may only provide services to higher-level software. Firmware such as the program of an embedded system {{may be the only}} program that will run on the system and provide all of its functions.|$|E

40|$|In any {{development}} cycle {{the push to}} get hardware available for the software is of high priority. Due to the complexity and time consuming nature of software development, it isn’t unusual to have a small satellite ready for launch with software features lagging behind. Continuing the software development while the satellite is integrated and waits on the launch pad is desired but the risk of attempting a software update in-orbit can be a high risk and daunting task. Including a simple firmware boot-loader can provide the satellite with a method for <b>updating</b> <b>firmware</b> through-out the small satellites life. Adopting simple but robust design strategies can {{be the difference between}} upgrading existing firmware and turning the small satellite into an expensive piece of orbital debris.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedGovernment at all levels, industry, military and critical infrastructure, {{may be at}} risk due to purposeful manipulation of micro-processing chips during the manufacturing process. Many microchips intentionally provide remote access to allow for monitoring and <b>updating</b> <b>firmware.</b> However, a remote access capability also introduces a vulnerability, which allows others to potentially take control of a system and shut it down remotely, spy, or remove data. If this is in fact occurring, the implications to the national and homeland security could be significant. It does not appear that there are currently policies and processes to identify purposefully manufactured vulnerable micro processing chips. Should it be determined that vulnerabilities do in fact exist, a federal government-led effort is needed to identify the entities producing these chips; to assess possible intentions of these actors; inventory hardware that is in use, which may have been compromised; and, finally, to pursue the development of a remediation strategy. Additionally, the current supply chain process will have to be re-examined to mitigate current and future concerns. Therefore, in 2012, the Government Accounting Office recommended that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) create and implement a cyber security supply chain vulnerability policy. This policy will assist the federal, state, and local governments, as well as private sector entities, to develop guidelines for procurement and policy decisions.

Previously, {{the initiation of}} UEFI <b>firmware</b> <b>updates</b> within an operating system could, on most systems, only be performed using Microsoft Windows-specific software. ESRT allows the firmware to expose updatable components to the operating system, which can pass a UEFI capsule with <b>updated</b> <b>firmware</b> for processing and installation on the next boot. Updates can be exposed via a command line tool, or within graphical package managers (such as GNOME Software) via a D-bus interface.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} <b>update</b> <b>firmware</b> is {{a feature that}} is found in nearly all modern {{embedded}} systems. We demonstrate how this feature can be exploited to allow attackers to inject malicious firmware modifications into vulnerable embedded devices. We discuss techniques for exploiting such vulnerable functionality and {{the implementation of a}} proof of concept printer malware capable of network reconnaissance, data exfiltration and propagation to general purpose computers and other embedded device types. We present a case study of the HP-RFU (Remote <b>Firmware</b> <b>Update)</b> LaserJet printer <b>firmware</b> modification vulnerability, which allows arbitrary injection of malware into the printer’s firmware via standard printed documents. We show vulnerable population data gathered by continuously tracking all publicly accessible printers discovered through an exhaustive scan of IPv 4 space. To show that <b>firmware</b> <b>update</b> signing is not the panacea of embedded defense, we present an analysis of known vulnerabilities found in third-party libraries in 373 LaserJet firmware images. Prior research has shown that the design flaws and vulnerabilities presented in this paper are found in other modern embedded systems. Thus, the exploitation techniques presented in this paper can be generalized to compromise other embedded systems...|$|R
