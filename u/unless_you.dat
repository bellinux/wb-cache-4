5|$|The VP {{update of}} 1991 {{featured}} cosmetic changes and mechanical however most were not visible <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> were {{to pull the}} motor down; and a very similar revised 3.8-litre V6 and 5.0-litre V8 engines from the VN were carried over. The 2.0-litre straight-four engine previously available in New Zealand was discontinued. Exterior cosmetic changes included a translucent acrylic grille on the base level Executive and Berlina, with a colour-coded grille for the S and SS, and a chrome grille for Calais. Updated tail lights and boot garnishes were {{also a part of}} the changes, which were different for each model, with the Berlina having grey stripes and the Calais chrome stripes. Semi-trailing arm independent rear suspension became standard on the Calais and SS, but was made an option on lower-end models in lieu of the live rear axle, improving ride and handling.|$|E
5|$|The {{only reason}} the Nazis put on {{prisoner}} broadcasts {{is to get}} people justifiably anxious about relatives reported missing at the front {{to listen to their}} propaganda. Although many of the messages undoubtedly are true, they represent but a small fraction of our prisoners and we have no assurance that many of them are not faked from papers picked up on the battlefield. What concerns some of us is the consequences of listening to Nazi broadcasts <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> are a well-trained listener (and often, even if you are). Nazi arguments often sound plausible. A person may listen to them with all the skepticism in the world, knowing that every word is a lie. But if the content is sufficiently sensational (and it often is) the source may be forgotten in time, and out pops the Nazi lie, all unsuspecting.|$|E

25|$|In The Horse and His Boy, Lewis {{uses the}} {{cultural}} settings of Narnia, Archenland, and Calormen {{to develop a}} theme of freedom in contrast to slavery. Lewis depicts the Calormene culture as one in which a primary guiding principle is that the weak must {{make way for the}} strong: For in Tashbaan there is only one traffic regulation, which is that everyone who is less important has {{to get out of the}} way for everyone who is more important; <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> want a cut from a whip or a punch from the butt end of a spear.|$|E
25|$|Isothermal - This model {{assumes that}} the {{compressed}} gas remains at a constant temperature throughout the compression or expansion process. In this cycle, internal energy {{is removed from the}} system as heat at the same rate that it is added by the mechanical work of compression. Isothermal compression or expansion more closely models real life when the compressor has a large heat exchanging surface, a small gas volume, or a long time scale (i.e., a small power level). Compressors that utilize inter-stage cooling between compression stages come closest to achieving perfect isothermal compression. However, with practical devices perfect isothermal compression is not attainable. For example, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> have an infinite number of compression stages with corresponding intercoolers, you will never achieve perfect isothermal compression.|$|E

25|$|<b>Unless</b> <b>you</b> have secret incriminating {{evidence}} against Furtwängler supporting your accusation {{that he was}} a tool of Nazi Party, I beg to take violent issue with your decision to ban him. The man never was a Party member. Upon numerous occasions, he risked his own safety and reputation to protect friends and colleagues. Do not believe that the fact of remaining in one's own country is alone sufficient to condemn a man. On the contrary, as a military man, you would know that remaining at one's post often requires greater courage than running away. He saved, and for that we are deeply his debtors, the best part of his own German culture... I believe it patently unjust and most cowardly for us to make of Furtwängler a scapegoat for our own crimes. If the man is guilty of specific crimes, accuse him and convict him. As far as I can see, it is no punishment to be banned from sordid, filthy Berlin and if the man now old and ill is willing and anxious to return to his exacting task and responsibilities he should be encouraged for that is where he belongs, right in Berlin...|$|E
25|$|The Longhorns {{came into}} Lincoln, Nebraska as the 16th {{best team in}} the country and one year removed from being in the College World Series. The Longhorns were the heavy {{favorite}} heading into the weekend series but found themselves down in the series after being defeated Friday night by the Huskers. In front of a crowd of 5,852, the Husker's made history. The Husker pitching staff combined for 19 strikeouts, 3 walks, 4 hits, 210 pitches thrown and 15 innings of work. The impressive part about this stat line wouldn't of even been noticed <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> attended the game. The Husker pitching staff threw 9 innings of no-hit baseball during this 15 inning marathon. From the 4th inning to the 14th inning, the Longhorns were unable to record a single hit off the Husker pitching staff of Kyle Kubat, Jake Hohensee, Colton Howell and Jeff Chesnut. These four pitchers were honored with the Louisville Slugger National Players of the week award; {{for the first time in}} NCAA history, this award was given to four pitchers from the same school, in the same week. Kubat threw 8.0 innings, Hohensee 2.0, Howell 2.2 and Chesnut 2.1 as well as the win.|$|E

[...] He noted that the original tournament characters are included, although they {{were not included in}} the original three separate modules, and that not all of them conform to the rules in the Players Handbook. Two spells were also added, which had been absent from the original modules. Bambra says that he [...] "would suggest not playing these <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> have been playing for a few years, success depends more on player skill than on high character levels and DMing adventures of this level can be a nightmare <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> have had plenty of experience." ...|$|E
