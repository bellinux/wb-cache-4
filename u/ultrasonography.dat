5|$|Specialized {{training}} in venous <b>ultrasonography</b> is not undertaken in some countries, which undermines best practice, mainly when varicose veins {{need to be}} examined.|$|E
5|$|No {{contraindications}} {{are known}} for this examination. <b>Ultrasonography</b> does not involve the use of ionizing radiation, and the procedure is harmless and can be safely used on anybody of any age. A World Health Organization report published in 1998 supports this.|$|E
5|$|Other imaging methods, such as <b>ultrasonography,</b> {{computed}} tomography (CT), and magnetic imaging (MRI), can aid in diagnosis. Blood tests {{can also help}} identify the presence of infection: the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), the C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and chlamydial and gonococcal DNA probes.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{simplified}} technique called compression <b>ultrasonography</b> {{which can be}} used for quick DVT diagnosis, mainly for the common femoral vein and the popliteal vein. It is very useful in an emergency situation and is performed just by vein compression using transducer pressure.|$|E
5|$|Researchers at the University of L'Aquila, using <b>ultrasonography,</b> {{presented}} {{evidence that}} women who experience vaginal orgasms are statistically {{more likely to have}} thicker tissue in the anterior vaginal wall. The researchers believe these findings make it possible for women to have a rapid test to confirm whether or not they have a G-spot. Professor of genetic epidemiology, Tim Spector, who co-authored research questioning the existence of the G-spot and finalized it in 2009, also hypothesizes thicker tissue in the G-spot area; he states that this tissue may be part of the clitoris and is not a separate erogenous zone.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} {{should not}} be used without a medical indication, such as with a reason to expect that a person is at heightened risk of having deep vein thrombosis. This screening is not effective at diagnosing DVT in the absence of other indications that the patient may have this condition. A common example of overuse of this procedure is the practice of performing <b>ultrasonography</b> routinely on patients without indication after knee or hip replacement.|$|E
5|$|Ultrasound is {{commonly}} used {{in the evaluation of}} people who have sustained physical trauma, for example with the FAST protocol. Ultrasound may be more sensitive than chest X-rays in the identification of pneumothorax after blunt trauma to the chest. Ultrasound may also provide a rapid diagnosis in other emergency situations, and allow the quantification {{of the size of the}} pneumothorax. Several particular features on <b>ultrasonography</b> of the chest can be used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{arterial}} ultrasound study, {{when the}} sonographer studies venous insufficiency, the vein wall itself has no relevance and attention will {{be focused on}} the direction of blood flow. The objective of the examination is to see how the veins drain. In this way, venous <b>ultrasonography</b> has at times become a hemodynamic examination which is reserved for experienced sonographers who have completed hemodynamic studies and training and have acquired a deep knowledge of this subject.|$|E
5|$|Perforator veins play a {{very special}} role in the venous system, {{carrying}} blood from superficial to deep veins. During the muscular systole their valves close and stop any blood flow coming from the deep to the superficial veins. When their valves become insufficient, {{they are responsible for}} a rapid deterioration in existing varicose disease and for the development of venous ulcers. Detection of insufficient perforators is important because they need to be ligatured. However, the detection of competent ones is as important because they may be used strategically in new techniques of conservative surgery, for example a minimally invasive CHIVA. The <b>ultrasonography</b> report will include insufficient and continent perforators, which will also be shown on venous mapping. To test these veins properly, the examiner will need to use some techniques like the Paraná maneuver, toe and foot flexion, and hyper-extension on tip toes.|$|E
5|$|The small {{saphenous vein}} (SSV), {{runs along the}} {{posterior}} aspect of the leg {{as far as the}} popliteal region, in the upper calf. Here it enters the popliteal space which is located between the two heads of the gastrocnemius muscle where it usually drains above the knee joint in the popliteal vein or a little less often in the great saphenous vein (GSV) or other deep muscular veins of the thigh. The use of <b>ultrasonography</b> has allowed a number of variations to be shown at this level; when no contact is made with the popliteal vein it might be seen to drain in the GSV, at a variable level; or, it may merge with the Giacomini vein and drain in the GSV at the superior 1/3 of the thigh. It can also but rarely, drain in the vein of the semimembranosus (thigh muscle) (shown below). Usually though, it connects with a perforator vein at its middle 1/3. To check for insufficiency, the Paraná maneuver is very useful.|$|E
5|$|The use of <b>ultrasonography</b> in {{medicine}} soon followed in different {{locations around the}} world. In the mid-1950s more research was undertaken by Professor Ian Donald et al., in Glasgow, which advanced the practical technology and applications of ultrasound. In 1963, in France, Léandre Pourcelot started on his thesis, which was presented in 1964, and used pulsed Doppler for blood flow calculation as its subject. This was followed up by Peronneau in 1969. Dr. Gene Strandness and the bio-engineering group at the University of Washington who conducted research on Doppler ultrasound as a diagnostic tool for vascular disease, published their first work in 1967. The first report published about the venous system appeared around 1967–1968.|$|E
5|$|Varansi {{has several}} hospitals, {{including}} Heritage Hospital, Marwari Hospital, Pitambari Hopspital, Mata Anand Mai Hospital, Rajkiya Hospital, Ram Krishna Mission Hospital, Shiv Prasad Gupta Hospital, Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital (managed by state govt.) {{the largest and}} superspeciality hospital is Sir Sundar Lal Hospital (University Hospital) having more 1150 beds separate trauma centre having 340 beds, and Varanasi Hospital and Medical Research Centre. A separate cancer institute is also operated in Varanasi. The Varanasi Hospital, established in 1964 by Dr. Baijnath Prasad. The hospital, which in 2012 had 66 beds, serves Varanasi and surrounding districts and states, many of which rely on it for surgery. Although the hospital suffers {{from a lack of}} funding, it has facilities such as x-ray, <b>ultrasonography,</b> echocardiography and a pathology lab. The urban portion of Varanasi District had an infant mortality rate of 70 per 1,000 live births in 2010–2011.|$|E
5|$|Liver AVMs may be {{suspected}} {{because of}} abnormal liver function {{tests in the}} blood, because the symptoms of heart failure develop, or because of jaundice or other symptoms of liver dysfunction. The most reliable initial screening test is Doppler <b>ultrasonography</b> of the liver; this has a very high sensitivity for identifying vascular lesions in the liver. If necessary, contrast-enhanced CT {{may be used to}} further characterize AVMs. It is extremely common to find incidental nodules on liver scans, most commonly due to focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), as these are a hundredfold times more common in HHT compared to the general population. FNH is regarded as harmless. Generally, tumor markers and additional imaging modalities are used to differentiate between FNH and malignant tumors of the liver. Liver biopsy is discouraged in people with HHT as the risk of hemorrhage from liver AVMs may be significant. Liver scans may be useful if someone is suspected of HHT, but does not meet the criteria (see below) unless liver lesions can be demonstrated.|$|E
25|$|Medical <b>ultrasonography</b> is a {{diagnostic}} aid to mammography. Adding <b>ultrasonography</b> testing {{for women with}} dense breast tissue increases the detection of breast cancer, but also increases false positives.|$|E
25|$|Velocity {{measurements}} of blood flow {{are also used}} in other fields of medical <b>ultrasonography,</b> such as obstetric <b>ultrasonography</b> and neurology. Velocity measurement of blood flow in arteries and veins based on Doppler effect is an effective tool for diagnosis of vascular problems like stenosis.|$|E
25|$|Currently, Doppler <b>ultrasonography</b> is not {{considered}} to significantly contribute to the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|The main imaging tests {{performed}} {{in order to}} identify renal cell carcinoma are pelvic and abdominal CT scans, ultrasound tests of the kidneys (<b>ultrasonography),</b> MRI scans, intravenous pyelogram (IVP) or renal angiography. Among these main diagnostic tests, other radiologic tests such as excretory urography, positron-emission tomography (PET) scanning, <b>ultrasonography,</b> arteriography, venography, and bone scanning {{can also be used to}} aid in the evaluation of staging renal masses and to differentiate non-malignant tumours from malignant tumours.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ultrasonography</b> and CT scan are {{not very}} useful in finding cause of dysphagia; but can detect masses in {{mediastinum}} and aortic aneurysms.|$|E
25|$|Most {{individuals}} with a significant ASD are diagnosed in utero or in early childhood {{with the use of}} <b>ultrasonography</b> or auscultation of the heart sounds during physical examination.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, the {{diagnosis}} is made {{at the time of}} birth by physical examination. Recent advances in prenatal diagnosis have allowed obstetricians to diagnose facial clefts in utero with <b>ultrasonography.</b>|$|E
25|$|Doppler <b>ultrasonography</b> of the uterine arteries to {{investigate}} {{for signs of}} inadequate placental perfusion. This test has a high negative predictive value among those individuals {{with a history of}} prior pre-eclampsia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ultrasonography</b> could {{demonstrate}} omphaloenteric duct remnants or cysts. Computed tomography (CT scan) {{might be}} a useful tool to demonstrate a blind ended and inflamed structure in the mid-abdominal cavity, which is not an appendix.|$|E
25|$|The {{conventional}} invasive arthrography is now-a-days {{being replaced}} by the non-invasive MRI and US and is used as an imaging reserve for patients who are contraindicated for MRI, for example pacemaker-carriers with an unclear and unsure <b>ultrasonography.</b>|$|E
25|$|Conventional x-rays and <b>ultrasonography</b> are {{the primary}} tools used to confirm a {{diagnosis}} of injuries sustained to the rotator cuff. For extended clinical questions, imaging through Magnetic Resonance with or without intraarticular contrast agent is indicated.|$|E
25|$|Diagnostic {{radiology}} {{is concerned}} with imaging of the body, e.g. by x-rays, x-ray computed tomography, <b>ultrasonography,</b> and nuclear magnetic resonance tomography. Interventional radiologists can access areas in the body under imaging for an intervention or diagnostic sampling.|$|E
25|$|Carotid Intima-media {{thickness}} Scan (CIMT can {{be measured}} by B-mode <b>ultrasonography)</b> measurement has been recommended by the American Heart Association as the most useful method to identify atherosclerosis and may now {{very well be the}} gold standard for detection.|$|E
25|$|Some {{physicians}} and patients may consider having lower limbs venous <b>ultrasonography</b> {{to screen for}} deep vein thrombosis after hip replacement. However, this kind of screening should only be done when indicated because to perform it routinely would be unnecessary health care.|$|E
25|$|For the ovarian {{hyperstimulation}} in itself, injectable gonadotropins (usually FSH analogues) {{are generally}} used under close monitoring. Such monitoring frequently checks the estradiol level and, {{by means of}} gynecologic <b>ultrasonography,</b> follicular growth. Typically approximately 10 days of injections will be necessary.|$|E
25|$|The {{hospital}} {{must have}} two operating rooms (and a recovery room) with personnel on duty that allow operation at any time, {{as well as}} support services that can perform additional examination or analysis at any time, such as medical imaging (radiography, medical <b>ultrasonography,</b> CAT Scanners, haematology, toxicology laboratory etc.).|$|E
25|$|Between 5% and 42% {{of women}} seen for {{ultrasound}} assessment {{with a positive}} pregnancy test have a pregnancy of unknown location (PUL), that is a positive pregnancy test but no pregnancy visualized at transvaginal <b>ultrasonography.</b> Between 6 and 20% of PUL are subsequently diagnosed with actual ectopic pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Cahn et al. prospectively followed-up 152 {{patients}} with {{coronary artery disease}} for 6–11 months by carotid artery <b>ultrasonography</b> and noted 22 vascular events (myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, stroke, and coronary angioplasty) within this time period. They concluded that carotid atherosclerosis measured by this non-interventional method has prognostic significance in coronary artery patients.|$|E
25|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} {{may occur}} at birth or develop in early life. Risk factors include family history, certain swaddling practices, and breech birth. If one identical twin is affected, {{there is a}} 40% risk the other will also be affected. Screening all babies for the condition by physical examination is recommended. <b>Ultrasonography</b> may also be useful.|$|E
25|$|The Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) Standard is used {{globally}} to store, exchange, {{and transmit}} medical images. The DICOM Standard incorporates protocols for imaging {{techniques such as}} radiography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), <b>ultrasonography,</b> and radiation therapy. DICOM includes standards for image exchange (e.g., via portable media such as DVDs), image compression, 3-D visualization, image presentation, and results reporting.|$|E
25|$|The {{next major}} {{development}} {{in the evolution of}} sclerotherapy was the advent of duplex <b>ultrasonography</b> in the 1980s and its incorporation into the practise of sclerotherapy later that decade. Knight was an early advocate of this new procedure and presented it at several conferences in Europe and the United States. Thibault's article was the first on this topic to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} several other tests {{that can be}} used to gather more {{information}} about the prostate and the urinary tract. Digital rectal examination (DRE) may allow a doctor to detect prostate abnormalities. Cystoscopy shows the urinary tract from inside the bladder, using a thin, flexible camera tube inserted down the urethra. Transrectal <b>ultrasonography</b> creates a picture of the prostate using sound waves from a probe in the rectum.|$|E
25|$|Some {{physicians}} and patients may consider having lower limbs venous <b>ultrasonography</b> {{to screen for}} deep vein thrombosis after knee replacement. However, this kind of screening should be done only when indicated because to perform it routinely would be unnecessary health care. If a medical condition exists that could cause deep vein thrombosis, a physician can choose to treat patients with cryotherapy and intermittent pneumatic compression as a preventive measure.|$|E
