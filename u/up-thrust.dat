30|$|Along the E–W seismic profile (Fig.  5), the onlapping seismic unit (U 5) of Pleistocene to Recent sediments {{occurring}} {{over the}} preformed flexure structure helps in inferring that this event of <b>up-thrusting</b> {{has taken place}} during Pleistocene–Recent time towards the northern forearc, but in the northern sector, {{the presence of this}} dome-like feature is not very clear (Fig.  3). Towards the south, the formation of these domal/folded features with thrust faults spread over a length of ~  27  km along E–W direction (Figs.  5, 7) indicates a zone of recent compressional uplift with probable linkage to the regional tectonics. These deformed sediments of the trough fill beyond EMF are separated from the AFB by a major thrust fault further east (Figs.  4, 5, 6, 7). The entire western rim of the AFB from north to south is associated with the domal-shaped seabed topography caused by the late Oligocene to Miocene upthrust activities. The uplifted part is separated from the surrounding basin configuration by an old marginal fault (of most likely pre-Miocene time). It also seems to have been reactivated in Recent times as evident from the updip reflection of sag fill deposition towards the basin (Figs.  4, 5, 6, 7). Along E–W profile L 4, the acoustic basement (the Oligocene top) between SP 3100 and 3300 is inferred as a westward dipping surface, deformed by normal faults (Fig.  7) and overlain by an upthrust sedimentary column of the Mid-Miocene–Recent age. The seismic reflection pattern within this entire assemblage suggests significant reactivation of small-scale faults prior to the Early Miocene that may have caused substantial deformation within the strata (Fig.  7). The seismic images along this line further show that the upthrusts partly extend towards the interior of the basin. Regional reactivation of faults during the same time has also been reported in the Sumatra Forearc region by Berglar et al. (2008).|$|R

The massif exhibits a conspicuous layered structure which consists of layers of dunite, lherzolite, plagioclase lherzolite, and {{a small amount of}} gabbro and pyroxenite. Coexisting minerals from all the rock types of the layered ultramafic to mafic sequence were analysed by EPMA. The ferromagnesian minerals show large compositional variations in accordance with lithological change in the series of dunite → lherzolite → plagioclase lherzolite → gabbro. Forsterite content of olivine varies successively from Fo 92. 5 to Fo 64. 5. Enstatite content of orthopyroxene also varies from En 93. 0 to En 85. 5. Large and continuous compositional variation was also obtained for clinopyroxenes, e. g. Ca 46 Mg 51 Fe 3 from dunite, Ca 48 Mg 48 Fe 4 from lherzolite, Ca 49 Mg 46 Fe 5 from plagioclase lherzolite, Ca 50 Mg 44 Fe 6 from the margin of gabbro, and Ca 38 Mg 39 Fe 23 from the center of gabbro. Al and Ti contents of clinopyroxcncs and pargasitic amphiboles increase with decrease of the Mg/ Mg + Fe ratio. The mineralogical characteristics indicate that the Horoman layered sequence represents a magmatic series formed by fractional crystallization. The gabbroic seams in the plagioclase lherzolite and the layers of gabbro were probably formed by crystallization of residual liquid which were slightly alkaline in chemical nature. The Horoman ultramafic rocks are strongly modified by deep-seated deformation and recrystallization, and additionally by mylonitization during the <b>up-thrusting</b> intrusion into the Earth's crust. The primary composition of minerals, obtained by step-scanning EPMA analyses are recognized as a distinct and uniform compositional plateaus at the cores of large, porphyroclastic, primary grains. The equilibration temperatures were calculated for the orthopyroxene-clinopyroxene pairs of primary porphyroclasts, using the Opx-Cpx geothermometer. The temperatures range from 900 ℃ to 1, 100 ℃. The estimates for the neoblastic pyroxene pairs are slightly lower, ranging between 850 ℃ and 1, 000 ℃. The rocks might have re-equilibrated under the subsolidus conditions in the upper mantle...|$|R
40|$|The Rubjerg Knude Glaciotectonic Complex is a thin-skinned thrust-fault {{complex that}} was formed during {{the advance of}} the Scandinavian Ice Sheet (30 000 – 26 000 B. P.); it is well exposed in a 6 km long coastal profile {{bordering}} the North Sea in northern Denmark. Theglaciotectonic thrust-fault deformation revealed by this cliff section {{has been subjected to}} detailed structural analysis based on photogrammetric measurement and construction of a balanced cross-section. Thirteen sections are differentiated, characterising the distal to proximal structural development of the complex. The deformation affected three stratigraphic units: the Middle Weichselian arctic marine Stortorn Formation, the mainly glaciolacustrine Lønstrup Klint Formation and the dominantly fluvial Rubjerg Knude Formation; these three formations are formally defined herein, together with the Skærumhede Group which includes the Stortorn and Lønstrup Klint Formations. The Rubjerg Knude Formation was deposited on a regional unconformity that caps the Lønstrup Klint Formation and separates pre-tectonic deposits below from syntectonic deposits above. In the distal part of the complex, the thrust-fault architecture is characterised by thin flatlying thrust sheets displaced over the footwall flat of the foreland for a distance of more than 500 m. Towards the proximal part of the complex, the dip of the thrust faults increases, and over long stretches they are over-steepened to an upright position. The lowest décollement zone is about 40 m below sea level in the proximal part of the system, and shows a systematicstep-wise change to higher levels in a distal (southwards) direction. The structural elements are ramps and flats related to hanging-wall and footwall positions. Above upper ramp-hinges,hanging-wall anticlines developed; footwall synclines are typically related to growth-fault sedimentation in syntectonic piggyback basins, represented by the Rubjerg Knude Formation. Blocks and slump-sheets constituting parts of the Lønstrup Klint Formation were derived from the tips of <b>up-thrusted</b> thrust sheets and slumped into the basins. Mud diapirs are a prominent element in the thrust-fault complex, resulting from mud mobilisation mainly at hanging-wallflats and ramps. Shortening during thrust-fault deformation has been calculated as 50 %. Only about 11 % of the initial stratigraphic units subjected to thrust faulting has been lost due to erosion. The thrust-fault deformation was caused by gravity spreading of an advancing ice sheet. Overpressured mud-fluid {{played an important role in}} stress transmission. The average velocity of thrust-fault displacement is estimated at 2 m per year, which led to compression of a 12 kmstretch of flat-lying sediments, c. 40 m in thickness, into a thrust-fault complex 6 km in length. The thrust-fault complex is truncated by a glaciotectonic unconformity, formed when the advancing ice sheet finally overrode the complex. When this ice sheet melted away, a hilland-hole pair was formed, and meltwater deposits derived from a new ice-advance (NE-Ice) filled the depression. The NE-Ice overran the complex during its advance to the main stationary line situated in the North Sea. When this ice in turn melted away (c. 19 000 – 15 000 B. P.), the glacial landscape was draped by arctic marine deposits of the Vendsyssel Formation (new formation defined herein) ...|$|R
40|$|In the {{state-of-the-art}} geology, {{concepts of}} evolution of interrelated geodynamic and biotic events {{throughout the history}} of the Earth have been developed (Fig. 1). Research results on sediments, bio-stratigraphy and geodynamics of the southern fragment of the Siberian craton (SSC, Fig. 2) provide for more or less reliable assessments of the status and evolution of ancient landscapes and biotas from the Lower Proterozoic to the Cenozoic. In the Lower Proterozoic, the geodynamic regime of the Urik-Iyskiy graben was {{similar to those of the}} westernpacific island-arc systems, which resulted in the orogen formation and established post-orogen granitoids of 1. 86 bln years of age. At the beginning of the Early Riphean, volcano-sedimentary masses were accumulated in continental basins (Fig. 2, 3 A). Collision orogenesis also resulted in the occurrence of the terrigeno-volcanogenic complex of the Akitkanskaya suite in the Western Pribaikalie and the transecting Irelskiy granitoids, aged 1. 86 bln years, at the edge of the craton. Later on, most probably before the Riphean, peneplanation took place, and a shallow peripheral sea was formed with highly-mature sediments of the Purpolskaya suite. Different environments are reconstructed in the KodarUdokan zone. Sediments of the Udokanskaya suite, varying in thicknesses from 11 to 14 km, suggest a complicated evolution of sedimentation in the peripheral marine basin. Dozens of radiochronological datings of granitoids of the Chuiskiy and Kodarskiy complex which transect the Udokanskaya suite are within the range from 1. 7 to 2. 0 bln years. From the deposit composition and texture, it can be suggested that the middle, Chineiskaya sub-suite was formed under island-arc conditions; and glacial phenomena occurred in the late Udokan time. Further geological history of the SSC can be described only within the period after the Late Riphean sedimentations (see Fig. 3 Б, В). The SSC evolution in the Neo-Proterozoic began with divergence events, which most probably occurred in the period of 1000 – 850 mln years in the east, and in the interval of 780 – 730 mln years in the west of the territory. The latest period is logically aligned with disintegration of Rodini, the super-continent. The period of 780 – 680 mln years in the eastern part of the region can defined by the beginning of convergency processes, formation and evolution of the island arc and the back-arc basin. It is supposed that basal layers of the Baikalskaya and Oselokskaya suites and their analogues occurred 730 mln years ago, and evidences of glacial processes in these series correlate with the global Sturtian glaciations. The period of 680 – 630 mln years was characterized by formation of the foreland-type peripheral basin which was then replaced by a system of orogen-type submontain troughs in the Early Vendian (from 630 mln years, see Fig. 3 Г). The second half of the Vendian in various zones of SSC was distinguished by shallow-water carbonate-terrigenous sediments of a similar type. Compensatory sedimentation occurred in residual valleys of the basin. Fast infill of the basin and leveling of the relief resulted in the stationary regime of the relatively shallow, yet vast basin. In the Early Cambrian, carbonate sedimentation occurred throughout the Siberian Platform and in the area adjacent to the SSC (see Fig. 3 Д). The Paleozoic sediments preserved mainly in the central and northern regions of the Siberian Platform reflect a complex evolution of internal and epicontinental seas and shallower basins of the Siberian continent named Angarida. In the Ordovician, predominating were carbonate rocks with marine fauna. In the Silurian was characterized by a variety of sediments formed in different marine environments, ranging from distal shelf to shallow water and salted gulfs. In the Late Silurian and the Early Devonian, the territory of Angarida was land. Local volcanism with mafic lava eruptions through fractures took place at the background of sub-continental sedimentation. In the Late Paleozoic, the geologic development was marked by major transformation of the pattern of tectonic structures, that was most likely related to inside-plate extension and thinning of the continental crust. In the Mid and Late Carbon (Fig. 4 A), the integrated Tungusskiy sedimentation basin was formed as a result of continuous and uniform bending. In the Early Permian (see Fig. 4 Б), positive tectonic movements led to significant dewatering of the Paleozoic basins, so that they turned into a washed-out area. Overall raising of the Siberian Platform preconditioned climate changes, such as aridization and climate cooling. In the Mesozoic, landscapes were presented by a combination of flat uplands, wide river valleys with swampy plains and lakes wherein carbonous sediments were accumulated. Basic volcanism with shield eruptions and sub-volcanic rocks was typical then. In the Jurassic (see Fig. 4 B), elements observed in the recent topography of the Siberian Platform were formed. In that period, major structural transformation occurred in association with the largest diastrophic cycles in the territory of the Eastern Asia, including formation of the Baikal rift and its branches. From the analyses of the available data which are briefly presented above, it is obvious that the period of two billion years in the Earth history includes numerous epochs of diastrophic processes of tremendous destructive capacity. Unconformities of formations differing in ages by millions and even hundreds of million years, as those dating back to the Pre-Cambrian, suggest quite realistic yet astounding visions. At the background of scenarios of floods, rock <b>up-thrusts,</b> volcanic explosions and earthquakes evidenced from the very remote past, the current geological and climatic phenomena may seem quite trivial. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAge-related {{changes in}} {{breeding}} performance {{are likely to}} be mediated through changes in parental foraging performance. We investigated the relationship of foraging performance with age in female little penguins at Phillip Island, Australia, during the guard phase of the 2005 breeding season. Foraging parameters were recorded with accelerometers for birds grouped into three age-classes: (1) young, (2) middle age and (3) old females. We found the diving behaviour of middleaged birds differed from young and old birds. The dive duration of middle age females was shorter than that of young and old birds while their dive effort (measure for dive and post-dive duration relation) was lower than that of young ones, suggesting middle-aged birds were in better physical condition than other ones. There was no difference in prey pursuit frequency or duration between age classes, but in the hunting tactic. Females pursued more prey around and after reaching the maximum depth of dives the more experienced they were (old. middle age. young), an energy saving hunting tactic by probably taking advantage of <b>up-thrust</b> momentum. We suggest middle age penguins forage better than young or old ones because good physical condition and foraging experience could act simultaneously...|$|E
40|$|The great Tohoku {{earthquake}} of March 11, 2011 {{generated a}} very destructive and anomalously high tsunami. To understand its source mechanism, an examination was undertaken of the seismotectonics {{of the region}} and of the earthquake ’ focal mechanism, energy release, rupture patterns and spatial and temporal sequencing and clustering of major aftershocks. It was determined that the great tsunami resulted from a combination of crustal deformations of the ocean floor due to <b>up-thrust</b> tectonic motions, augmented by additional uplift due to the quake’s slow and long rupturing process, as well as to large coseismic lateral movements which compressed and deformed the compacted sediments along the accretionary prism of the overriding plane. The deformation occurred randomly and non-uniformly along parallel normal faults and along oblique, en-echelon faults to the earthquake’s overall rupture direction – the latter failing in a sequential bookshelf manner with variable slip angles. As the 1992 Nicaragua and the 2004 Sumatra earthquakes demonstrated, such bookshelf failures of sedimentary layers could contribute to anomalously high tsunamis. As with the 1896 tsunami, additional ocean floor deformation and uplift of the sediments was responsible for the higher waves generated by the 2011 earthquake. The efficiency of tsunami generation was greate...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study has been to {{decipher}} the maximum paleo-temperatures and the exhumation rates of the sedimentary successions constituting the Eastern Sicily fold-and-thrust belt through a multidisciplinary approach based on the integration of different thermal and thermo-chronological methodologies. In particular, three sectors of the Eastern Sicily fold-and-thrust belt were investigated: the Internal Zone of the Peloritani Mts., the frontal part of the thrust belt in the Mt. Judica area and the outcropping area of the Numidian Flysch. In the Peloritani Mts., the integration of Vitrinite reflectance and mixed-layered clay minerals with published apatite fission-track and (U-Th) /He ages allowed to reconstruct the paleo-geothermal gradient of the Stilo-Capo d’Orlando basin in Oligocene-Miocene times, to constrain its burial evolution and discriminate between areas where it has been affected by sedimentary and/or tectonic load. In the southern area of the basin, organic and inorganic thermal parameters increase as function of depth suggesting that their evolution is ruled by sedimentary burial. They recorded a decrease in paleo-geothermal gradient values which marked the evolution of the basin from a fore-arc to a thrust-top setting during the convergence-collision process between the Calabria-Peloritani Arc and the African plate. Differently, in the northern edge of the basin, high vitrinite reflectance values (0. 46 - 0. 58 %) indicate that the thermal evolution of this area was controlled by tectonic burial related to a late Langhian-early Serravallian out-of-sequence thrusting. The tectonic overburden has been totally removed by extensional tectonics and/or erosion since Late Miocene. The short time span at maximum temperature (< 2 Ma) elapsing between thrust stack emplacement and the beginning of its removal have allowed only vitrinite reflectance and thermo-chronological indicators to record this compressive reactivation. In the Mt. Judica area, the integration of X-ray diffraction (XRD) data concerning the illite content in mixed layer illite-smectite with data derived from Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) on H-rich organic matter allowed to constrain the burial- exhumation path of the Mt. Judica sedimentary succession cropping out in tectonic window in Eastern Sicily. Thermal constraints showed that the Mt. Judica succession experienced paleo-temperatures in the range of 100 - 130 °C in late diagenetic conditions and early mature stage of hydrocarbon generation with a general depth-dependent thermal maturity feature. Specifically, the illite content in mixed layer I-S increases from 50 to 76 % and FTIR-derived indexes suggest a thermal maturity equivalent to VRo values of at least 0. 5 - 0. 7 %. As a whole, the Mt. Judica succession experienced maximum tectonic burial (ranging between 2. 4 and 3. 2 km) during the Middle Miocene {{as a result of the}} emplacement of the Allochthonous Units atop it.

Restoration of balanced cross-sections revealed an increase of shortening from the salient to the Mt. Judica recess with values from 12. 3 to 23. 9 km, consistent with the increase of tectonic thickening of the fold-and-thrust belt. Integration of maximum burial and shortening values along the strike of the Sicilian fold-and-thrust belt allowed to reconstruct the wedge paleo-geometry in the Mt. Judica recess area, to investigate the along-strike variations of the tectonic overburden, and to discuss the geodynamic causes of these changes. These results were compared with theoretical models of wedge dynamics. For the Numidian Flysch thrust stack an increasing level of diagenesis from the uppermost to the lowermost tectono-stratigraphic units has been observed. From the top to the bottom of the tectonic pile, the Nicosia Unit showed the lowest % I values in I-S mixed layers in the range of 20 - 50 % and vitrinite reflectance data between 0. 36 - 0. 42 % in the immature stages of hydrocarbon generation. The Mt. Salici Unit displayed random ordered mixed layers I-S with an illite content of 50 - 55 %. These data correlated to slightly higher levels of diagenesis than those recorded in the Nicosia Unit, suggesting that sedimentary burial is the main factor affecting the thermal maturity of both units. The lowermost of the Numidian tectonic pile (Maragone Unit) revealed mixed-layered ordered structures with % of I in I-S between 66 and 79 % indicating the highest levels of thermal maturity for the Numidian Flysch. The integration of organic and inorganic thermal parameters with thermo-chronological data performed for my PhD project on the main outcropping tectono-stratigraphic Units in Eastern Sicily, contributed to the reconstruction of the burial and exhumation history of the Peloritani Mts. and the Apenninic-Maghrebian fold-and-thrust belt between the Nebrodi Mts. and the Hyblean Foreland...|$|E
