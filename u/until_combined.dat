40|$|AbstractA novel {{potassium}} channel gene has been cloned, characterized, and associated with cardiac arrhythmia. The gene encodes MinK-related peptide 1 (MiRP 1), a small integral membrane subunit that assembles with HERG, a pore-forming protein, to alter its function. Unlike channels formed only with HERG, mixed complexes resemble native cardiac IKr channels in their gating, unitary conductance, regulation by potassium, and distinctive biphasic inhibition by the class III antiarrhythmic E- 4031. Three missense mutations associated with long QT syndrome and ventricular fibrillation are {{identified in the}} gene for MiRP 1. Mutants form channels that open slowly and close rapidly, thereby diminishing potassium currents. One variant, associated with clarithromycin-induced arrhythmia, increases channel blockade by the antibiotic. A mechanism for acquired arrhythmia is revealed: genetically based reduction in potassium currents that remains clinically silent <b>until</b> <b>combined</b> with additional stressors...|$|E

40|$|Effective immunotherapeutic {{strategies}} {{require the}} ability to generate a systemic antigen-specific response capable of impacting both primary and metastatic disease. We have built on our oncolytic vaccinia GM-CSF strategy by adding recombinant tumor antigen to increase the response in the tumor microenvironment and systemically. In the present study, orthotopic growth of a syngeneic HER 2 /neu-overexpressing mammary carcinoma in FVB/N mice (NBT 1) was associated with increased Gr 1 +CD 11 b+ myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) both systemically and in the tumor microenvironment. This MDSC population had inhibitory effects on the HER 2 /neu specific Th 1 immune response. VVneu and VVGMCSF are recombinant oncolytic vaccinia viruses that encode HER 2 /neu and GM-CSF, respectively. Naïve FVB mice vaccinated with combined VVneu and VVGMCSF given systemically developed systemic HER 2 /neu-specific immunity.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{experiment}} was to compare in normal human subjects the differential effects on postural stability of introducing somatosensory noise via compliant and/or sway-referenced support surfaces during quiet standing. The use of foam surfaces (two thicknesses: thin (0. 95 cm) and thick (7. 62 cm)) and sway-referenced support allowed comparison between two different types of destabilizing factors that increased ankle/foot somatosensory noise. Under some conditions neck extensions were used to increase sensory noise by deviating the vestibular system from its optimal orientation for balance control. The impact of these conditions on postural control was assessed through objective measures of instability. Thick foam and sway-referenced support conditions generated comparable instability in subjects, as measured by equilibrium score and minimum time-to-contact. However, simultaneous application of the conditions resulted in greater instability, suggesting a higher level of generated sensory noise and thus, different receptor types affected during each manipulation. Indeed, sway-referenced support generated greater anterior-posterior center-of-mass (COM) sway, while thick foam generated greater medio-lateral COM sway and velocity. Neck extension had minimal effect on postural stability <b>until</b> <b>combined</b> with simultaneous thick foam and sway-referenced support. Thin foam never generated enough sensory noise to affect postural stability even with noise added by sway-reference support or neck extension. These results provide an interesting window into the central integration of redundant sensory information and indicate the postural impact of sensory inputs is not solely based on their existence, but also their level of noise...|$|E

40|$|The Mooselookmeguntic Igneous Complex (MIC) is a {{composite}} granite pluton located in northern Maine which straddles the tectonite zone that separates material with principally Grenville (North American) crustal sources from the Central Maine Belt wherein granite plutons commonly derive from Avalonian (non-North American) source materials. Leached feldspars were used to derive original or ‘common ’ Pb ratios but Pb was unable to unequivocally evaluate the relative contributions of differing basement sources <b>until</b> <b>combined</b> with existing Nd data. With one exception, the initial Nd isotopic composition for the less evolved rocks show a limited range of Nd (εNd(t) =- 2. 7 to- 0. 7) and Pb (207 Pb/ 204 Pb = 15. 55 to 15. 58), whereas the leucogranites are very heterogeneous (εNd(t) =- 6. 9 to- 0. 5; 207 Pb/ 204 Pb = 15. 55 to 15. 62). Combined isotope and elemental data {{were used to assess}} mantle contributions, of particular relevance among the less evolved rocks. A MORB-like mantle component was the likely primitive end-member while the more evolved end-member was likely a pelitic sediment. Isotopic data was used in mixing models to further constrain the contributions of possible two-component mixes. A MORB-like mantle/sediment mix was the most likely mode of petrogenesis permitting for three main conclusions. Magma that formed the MIC was generated by crustal anatexis and mixed with a mantle contribution of < 10 %. Source isotopic heterogeneity was preserved in the MIC or later overprinting processes disturbed a homogenous source signal.

40|$|My project {{begins with}} {{two things that}} I always come back to: home and craft. A {{significant}} inspiration for me comes from traditional crafts such as quilting, knitting, and embroidery. In a home, these skills create objects that conjure a sense of warmth, comfort, and human connection. Similarly, the use of crafts can harbor these sentimentalities in an unfamiliar place. This idea of home and folk art relates to my project because all deal with material and subject matter that are familiar and produce a final product by combining multiple layers or parts. Makers of traditional crafts do so through a strict methodology and repetitive, meditative process, ultimately synthesizing a multiplicity of ideas and materials into a single piece. A single stitch: inconsequential <b>until</b> <b>combined,</b> over and over, into something rich and full of time and meaning. For my project, I chose to depict a series of landscapes from Valley Forge National Historical Park. I {{spent most of my}} childhood in the area and have visited the places in these images many times. My goal is to evoke a sense of place and sentimentality through these images while offering the viewer an opportunity to explore different combinations of patterns within one image. I am interested in compositions with very little sky, instead choosing to focus on the horizon line and foliage within the foreground and middle ground to emphasize naturally occurring patterns. The choice of landscape as subject matter creates a place that the viewer can enter; filling these spaces with repeating patterns I hope to convey the same sense of meticulous meditative process that is required of a piece of knitting or textile. Much like a quilt that combines separate fabric pieces, each holding distinct memories, into a tapestry of varying shapes, colors and patterns, these landscapes are a tribute to the tapestry of memories I associate with these places as well as the numerous processes that are used to synthesize a completed print...|$|E
