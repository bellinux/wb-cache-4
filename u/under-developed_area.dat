There is no organised national competition {{in the same way that}} there is for men's football, in fact women's football almost seems to have developed in reverse. Initially, Bhutan entered a national team to the 2010 and 2012 SAFF Women's Championships without having either any formal women's competition, nor any qualified female coaches in the country, though there were apparently 200 registered female players in Bhutan in 2000. [...] Prior to their entry into international football, a women's competition was established in Bhutan for the first time, supported by a grant from FIFA and run by the Bhutan Football Federation. Because of the very under-developed state of women's football in Bhutan at this time, club teams did not exist and so the tournament consisted of teams representing individual Dzongkhags. This competition was used not only to increase the popularity of football amongst women in the country, but also to act as means of identifying and coaching players who would form the first ever Bhutan women's national football squad. The first open women's tournament was not held until 2013, and was a tournament aimed more at schoolgirls than women of all ages. Prior to this, the Bhutan Football Federation had only begun to organise the first Asian Football Confederation’s Women ‘C’ Certificate Coaching course in July 2013 in response to an increase inpopularity of the game among women. A German coach travelled to Bhutan to provide training at the first ever coaching course for women in Bhutan which was attended by eighteen women from a number of Dzongkhags.|$|E

This study examined the effect of rural infrastructures on profitability and productivity of cassava-based farms in Odogbolu local government area of Ogun state, Nigeria. The study was based on a cross-sectional survey of 120 cassava farmers selected with a multistage random sampling technique from 10 villages. Descriptive statistics were used to generate the composite rural infrastructure index which revealed that 5 out of the 10 sampled villages were under-developed. Economic efficiency in the developed and <b>under-developed</b> <b>areas</b> shows that farmers in the developed areas are better off compared to their counterparts in the <b>under-developed</b> <b>areas.</b> Farm size, years of farming experience and infrastructural {{development in}}dex (INF) were statistically significant with negative influence on productivity of cassava-based farmers. The significance and indirect relationship of the years of farming experience and infrastructural development index at p< 0. 05 and farm size (p< 0. 01) regarding the total factor productivity (TFP) implied that these variables decrease TFP. Similarly, the negative sign of the coefficient of INF of - 0. 742 at p< 0. 05 shows that the under-development of infrastructural facilities observed in the study area is capable of jeopardizing efforts at improving the productivity of cassava-based farmers. Therefore, farmer in the developed areas can generally produce more output at lower cost if there is an improvement in infrastructural facilities in the study area...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{discussion}} of the literature of an <b>under-developed</b> <b>area</b> of early years research—the exploration of childminding or home-based childcare and the contribution which this form of provision makes for children and families. Despite growing interest in childminding at the policy level and some international research on understanding home-based childcare settings and practices, there remains a relative dearth of studies conceptualising and reviewing the extant literature. This paper addresses this gap by presenting the findings of a comprehensive database search for literature and a review of published international work from 1990 to 2013. It offers a conceptual analysis of the notion of “home-based childcare”, with a focus on understanding caregivers’ practices, and the key issues and debates that characterise the field. The paper argues that home-based childcare not only offers a specialist type of service as family support, especially for vulnerable families, but that it provides a form of pedagogical approach to children’s developmental and educational outcomes that is distinct from any other types of early years care...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This {{paper is}} based on a {{literature}} review of recent publications in the field of benchmarking methodology implemented in small and medium enterprises with regards to measure and benchmark upstream, leading or developmental aspects of organizations. Benchmarking has been recognized as an essential tool for continuous improvement and competitiveness. It can also help SMEs to improve their operational and financial performances. However, only few entrepreneurs turn to benchmarking implementation, due to lack of time and resources. In this study current benchmarking models (2005 onwards), dedicated specifically to the SMEs, have been identified and their characteristics and objectives have been discussed. Key findings from this review confirm that this is an <b>under-developed</b> <b>area</b> of research and that most practitioner approaches are focused on benchmarking practices within SMEs. There is a need to extend theoretical and practical aspects of benchmarking in SMEs by studying the process of benchmarking with regards to the novel concept of lead benchmarking as a possible means of achieving increased radical and innovative transformation in organizational change.
