[...] He {{does not believe that}} God is omnipotent in the sense of having <b>unilateral</b> <b>control</b> over all events, since Cobb sees reconciling total coercive power with love and goodness to be an impossible task. [...] Instead, all creatures are viewed as having some degree of freedom that God cannot override. [...] Cobb solves the problem of evil by denying God’s omnipotence, stressing instead that God’s power is persuasive rather than coercive, that God can influence creatures but not determine what they become or do. [...] For Cobb, God’s role is to liberate and empower.|$|E
500|$|A major {{land reform}} was also conducted, led by Wolf Ladejinsky of MacArthur's SCAP staff. Between 1947 and 1949, {{approximately}} , or 38% of Japan's cultivated land, was purchased from the landlords under the government's reform program, and [...] was resold to the farmers who worked them. By 1950, 89% of all agricultural land was owner-operated and only 11% was tenant-operated. MacArthur's efforts to encourage trade union membership met with phenomenal success, and by 1947, 48% of the non-agricultural workforce was unionized. Some of MacArthur's reforms were rescinded in 1948 when his <b>unilateral</b> <b>control</b> of Japan was ended by the increased {{involvement of the}} State Department. During the Occupation, SCAP successfully, if not entirely, abolished many of the financial coalitions known as the Zaibatsu, which had previously monopolized industry. Eventually, looser industrial groupings known as Keiretsu evolved. The reforms alarmed many in the U.S. Departments of Defense and State, who believed they conflicted {{with the prospect of}} Japan and its industrial capacity as a bulwark against the spread of communism in Asia.|$|E

The DOJ filed suit over this and Bell publicly retorted, [...] "You can't give fans a game for free on TV and also expect {{them to go to}} the ballpark"; nevertheless, the suit was ordered to trial for January 1952. After the 1951 season ended, he gained <b>unilateral</b> <b>control</b> over the setting of a television strategy for the NFL. He negotiated a deal with DuMont, which granted it the rights to nationally broadcast one regular season game every week, and he directed that the income from this contract was to be shared equally between all the teams. In the DOJ's case, the judge ruled that the blackout policy was legal, but both Bell, and the franchises collectively, were enjoined from negotiating a TV contract; Bell was ecstatic. Later that year, Bell forced one of the owners of the Cleveland Browns to sell all of his shares in the team after Bell determined the owner had bet on Browns' football games. Although he hated to fly, at some indeterminate point, he visited the training camps of every team and lectured on the danger gamblers posed to the league.|$|E

500|$|Horch, who had {{remained}} a devoted follower of the Roeriches since his acceptance of their spiritual quest {{as his own}} in 1923, [...] started to fall out with them for unclear reasons. The Roeriches maintained that Horch's motives were base: through guile and deception they said he had taken control of the Master Building, closed the cultural institutions it contained, and severed them and their associated from everything connected with the building and its contents. Horch countered that the Roeriches had improperly attempted to countermand his decisions as building owner {{and director of the}} cultural organizations it contained. He said they had shown bad faith when they asserted that they alone could receive and interpret the commands of the supreme being whom they all worshiped. On June 8, 1935, he wrote Helena Roerich to say he feared that the Roeriches had lost confidence in himself and his wife Nettie. Then, on July 13, 1935, Nettie wrote Helena of her and Horch's [...] "fourteen years of complete devotion in heart and in deed" [...] and of their enduring [...] "loyalty and selfless sacrifice" [...] over that period. She reaffirmed their [...] "flaming devotion" [...] which they continued to hold in their hearts. And she said the Roeriches' attempt to exert <b>unilateral</b> <b>control</b> over their affairs had caused them to [...] "contemplate, review and think of matters in a new light." [...] These letters explain actions that Horch took on June 5, 1936, to sever relations between the Institute and the other cultural organizations housed at the Master Building and discharge all their employees. The employees who occupied rent-free apartments were told to vacate immediately.|$|E

40|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) is a {{prominent}} disease in developed countries, and age {{is an important}} factor in functional outcome. Although aged patients typically show diminished recovery compared to young patients, and have higher mortality and morbidity following TBI, the mechanism is not well understood. To date, there is no effective therapeutic for TBI. Previous studies indicate a secondary injury in TBI begins immediately after impact, and is likely the major contribution to delayed neuron dysfunction and loss. Studies also suggest mitochondrial dysfunction and increased free radical species (ROS) production following TBI may play a key role in the process. To evaluate oxidative damage following TBI, especially in aging, young (3 months), middle aged (12 months) and aged (22 months) Fisher- 344 rats were subjected to a <b>unilateral</b> <b>controlled</b> cortical impact (CCI) injury, and tissue sparing, 4 -hydroxynonenal (HNE) and acrolein levels, and antioxidant enzyme activities, and DNA oxidative damage were measured.

40|$|OBJECT: Cell {{therapy has}} shown {{preclinical}} promise {{in the treatment}} of many diseases, and its application is being translated to the clinical arena. Intravenous mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy has been shown to improve functional recovery after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Herein, the authors report on their attempts to reproduce such observations, including detailed characterizations of the MSC population, non-bromodeoxyuridine-based cell labeling, macroscopic and microscopic cell tracking, quantification of cells traversing the pulmonary microvasculature, and well-validated measurement of motor and cognitive function recovery. METHODS: Rat MSCs were isolated, expanded in vitro, immunophenotyped, and labeled. Four million MSCs were intravenously infused into Sprague-Dawley rats 24 hours after receiving a moderate, <b>unilateral</b> <b>controlled</b> cortical impact TBI. Infrared macroscopic cell tracking was used to identify cell distribution. Immunohistochemical analysis of brain and lung tissues 48 hours and 2 weeks postinfusion revealed transplanted cells in these locations, and these cells were quantified. Intraarterial blood sampling and flow cytometry were used to quantify the number of transplanted cells reaching the arterial circulation. Motor and cognitive behavioral testing was performed to evaluate functional recovery. RESULTS: At 48 hours post-MSC infusion, the majority of cells were localized to the lungs. Between 1. 5 and 3. 7...|$|R

40|$|Embryonic stem (ES) {{cells have}} been {{investigated}} in many animal models of injury and disease. However, {{few studies have examined}} the ability of pre-differentiated ES cells to improve functional outcome following traumatic brain injury (TBI). The {{purpose of the present study}} was to compare the effect of murine ES cells that were pre-differentiated into GABAergic neurons or astrocytes on functional recovery following TBI. Neural and astrocyte induction was achieved by co-culturing ES cells on a bone marrow stromal fibroblast (M 2 - 10 B 4) feeder layer and incubating them with various mitogenic factors. Rats were initially prepared with a <b>unilateral</b> <b>controlled</b> cortical contusion injury of the sensorimotor cortex or sham procedure. Rats were transplanted 7 days following injury with ∼ 100 K GABAergic neurons, astrocytes, fibroblasts, or media. Animals were assessed on a battery of sensorimotor tasks following transplantation. The stromal fibroblast cells (M 2 - 10 B 4), as a control cell line, did not differ significantly from media infusions. Transplantation of GABAergic neurons facilitated complete and total recovery on the vibrissae-forelimb placing test as opposed to all other groups, which failed to show any recovery. It was also found that GABAergic neurons reduced the magnitude of the initial impairment on the limb use test. Histological analysis revealed infiltratio...|$|R

40|$|Control and {{governance}} theories recognize that exchange partners {{are subject to}} two general forms of <b>control,</b> the <b>unilateral</b> authority of one firm and bilateral expectations extending from their social bond. In this way, a supplier both exerts <b>unilateral,</b> authority-based <b>controls</b> and is subject to socially-based, bilateral controls as it attempts to manage its brand successfully through reseller channels. Such control is being challenged by suppliers’ growing relative dependence on increasingly dominant resellers in many industries. Yet the impact of supplier relative dependence on the efficacy of control-based governance in the supplier’s channel is not well understood. To address this gap, we specify and test a control model moderated by relative dependence involving the conceptualization and measurement of governance {{at the level of}} specific control processes: incenting, monitoring, and enforcing. Our empirical findings show relative dependence undercuts the effectiveness of certain <b>unilateral</b> and bilateral <b>control</b> processes while enhancing the effectiveness of others, largely supporting our dual suppositions that each control process operates through a specialized behavioral mechanism and that these underlying mechanisms are differentially impacted by relative dependence. We offer implications of these findings for managers and identify our contributions to channel theory and research...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{evaluate}} the preclinical efficacy of pyridoxine, or vitamin B 6. Rats received a 3. 0 [*]mm <b>unilateral</b> <b>controlled</b> cortical impact (CCI) injury of the sensorimotor cortex or sham surgery. Treatment with vitamin B 6 (600 or 300 [*]mg/kg IP) or vehicle was administered at 30 [*]min and 24 [*]h post-CCI. Somatosensory dysfunction was evaluated with the vibrissae–forelimb placing and bilateral tactile adhesive removal tests. Sensorimotor dysfunction was evaluated with the locomotor placing and the forelimb asymmetry tests. On the forelimb asymmetry test both treatment groups displayed no asymmetry bias {{on any of the}} testing days post-CCI and were statistically no different than the shams. Both vitamin B 6 groups displayed a significant improvement in behavioral performance on the locomotor placing test compared to the vehicle-treated group. Administration of 600 [*]mg/kg also significantly reduced tactile adhesive removal latencies on days 2, 4, 6, and 12 post-CCI. Both treatment groups were improved in their rate of recovery post-CCI on the vibrissae–forelimb placing test, but only the recovery seen in the 600 -mg/kg group was significantly improved compared to vehicle. Finally, the 600 -mg/kg dose resulted in significant cortical sparing compared to the vehicle-treated group. In general, the effects of vitamin B 6 on recovery of function were dose-dependent, with the 600 -mg/kg dose consistently showing greater recovery than the 300 -mg/kg dose. More experimental analyses are warranted to evaluate the potential preclinical efficacy and mechanistic action of vitamin B 6...|$|R
