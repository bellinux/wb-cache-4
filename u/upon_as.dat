It is a chance for children to serve their priest and become closer to Jesus by being on the altar. In addition, it is an opportunity for them to try to make themselves more holy and therefore more worthy of the position.|$|E

5|$|On June 26, 1934, {{work began}} on {{the removal of the}} twelfth century Byzantine mosaics. It was {{conducted}} by the Mosaic Section of the Leningrad Academy of Fine Arts. Specialists were forced to work in haste on account of the impending demolition and were thus unable to complete the entire project. Despite the care and attention shown during the removal of the mosaics from the cathedral's walls, the relocated mosaics cannot be relied <b>upon</b> <b>as</b> being absolutely authentic.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} well known and for many years {{respected}} books about Wyatt Earp was the book I Married Wyatt Earp, originally credited as a factual memoir by Josephine Marcus Earp. Published in 1976, it was edited by amateur historian Glenn Boyer, and published by the respected University of Arizona Press. It was immensely popular for many years, capturing the imagination of people {{with an interest in}} western history, studied in classrooms, cited by scholars, and relied <b>upon</b> <b>as</b> factual by filmmakers.|$|E

5|$|Since {{before the}} start of the American Revolution, Boston and New York City have shared an intense rivalry as cities. For more than a century after its founding, Boston was arguably the educational, cultural, artistic, and {{economic}} power in the United States. Boston's location as the closest American port to Europe and its concentration of elite schools and manufacturing hubs helped maintain this position for several decades. During this time period, New York was often looked down <b>upon</b> <b>as</b> the upstart, over-populated, dirty cousin to aristocratic and clean Boston.|$|E
5|$|Taizong set out {{to solve}} {{internal}} problems within the government which had constantly plagued past dynasties. Building upon the Sui legal code, he issued a new legal code that subsequent Chinese dynasties would model theirs <b>upon,</b> <b>as</b> well as neighboring polities in Vietnam, Korea, and Japan. The earliest law code to survive was the one established in the year 653, which was divided into 500 articles specifying different crimes and penalties ranging from ten blows with a light stick, one hundred blows with a heavy rod, exile, penal servitude, or execution.|$|E
5|$|The {{deterioration}} of the Ming military position in the steppe transitional zone gave rise to nomadic raids into Ming territory, including the crucial Ordos region, on a level unprecedented since the dynasty's founding.

5|$|Under the {{original}} {{terms of the}} state constitution, the lieutenant governor was elected for a two-year term on a separate ticket from the governor; because of this, the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin {{have not always been}} of the same party. After a 1967 amendment, however, the two have been nominated, and voted <b>upon,</b> <b>as</b> a single ticket. Another 1967 amendment increased the terms of both the governor and lieutenant governor to four years. There is no limit to the number of terms a lieutenant governor may hold.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, {{seventeen}} {{people were}} indicted {{by a federal}} grand jury and five were found guilty of wilfully interfering with a marshal in performance of his duties (Braden, Patterson, Pryor, Purcell, and John J. Doyle, a leader in the Settler's League). They were convicted in federal court (with Judge Sawyer presiding) and sentenced to eight months in prison and fined $300 each. Their time spent in imprisonment was hardly difficult. Three of the men's wives were allowed to live with them, and Susan Curtis, daughter of one of the jailers, fell in love with and later married Braden. Upon their release in September 1881, they were greeted by a joyous crowd of 3,000 in Hanford. Such was the anti-railroad sentiment that the five were looked <b>upon</b> <b>as</b> heroes by many across California, and those killed were considered martyrs who had given their lives for a cause.|$|E

5|$|Britain annexed the Voortrekkers' {{short-lived}} Natalia Republic in 1843 as the Colony of Natal. Pretorius briefly led Boer {{resistance to}} this, but before long {{most of the}} Boers in Natal had trekked back north-west to {{the area around the}} Orange and Vaal Rivers. In 1845 Kruger was a member of Potgieter's expedition to Delagoa Bay in Mozambique to negotiate a frontier with Portugal; the Lebombo Mountains were settled <b>upon</b> <b>as</b> the border between Boer and Portuguese lands. After Maria and their first child died of fever in January 1846, Kruger married her cousin Gezina du Plessis, from the Colesberg area, in 1847. Their first child, Casper Jan Hendrik, was born on 22 December that year.|$|E
5|$|During 1941, the Middle East Commandos and Layforce were tasked {{to carry}} out a {{campaign}} of harassment and dislocation against enemy forces in the Mediterranean. At the time that Layforce was raised, the British had the ascendency in the theatre, as they had largely defeated the Italians. It was felt that the Commandos could be employed in the capture of the island of Rhodes. However, the arrival of the Afrika Korps in Cyrenaica and the invasion of Yugoslavia and Greece greatly changed the strategic outlook. By the time Layforce arrived in Egypt in March the situation had become dire. The deployment of forces to Greece meant that the Commandos became the only troops in general reserve. As the strategic situation worsened, it became increasingly difficult to employ them in the manner intended, as they were called <b>upon</b> <b>as</b> reinforcements {{to the rest of the}} army.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Curie {{recognised}} that {{wounded soldiers}} were best served if operated <b>upon</b> <b>as</b> soon as possible. She saw {{a need for}} field radiological centres near the front lines to assist battlefield surgeons. After a quick study of radiology, anatomy, and automotive mechanics she procured X-ray equipment, vehicles, auxiliary generators, and developed mobile radiography units, which came to be popularly known as petites Curies ("Little Curies"). She became {{the director of the}} Red Cross Radiology Service and set up France's first military radiology centre, operational by late 1914. Assisted at first by a military doctor and by her 17-year-old daughter Irène, Curie directed the installation of 20 mobile radiological vehicles and another 200 radiological units at field hospitals {{in the first year of}} the war. Later, she began training other women as aides.|$|E

5|$|Parsons, his sons, {{and other}} Confederate {{soldiers}} encountered Union Army cavalry along Grassy Lick Run south of Romney on April 24, 1862. Parsons carried a double-barreled shotgun, {{and proceeded to}} fire his weapon at the Union forces at close range. As Parsons made his escape from the Union Army forces, he saw his son fired <b>upon</b> <b>as</b> he ran across the road, and supposed he had been killed. He traveled {{to the home of}} a Mr.Hott, and told him of the news of his son's possible death. Parsons became pale and was helped down from his horse by Hott's sons, so he would not fall. According to Hott, Parsons died moments later.|$|E
5|$|The episode's script {{went through}} several {{different}} versions before a final plot was decided <b>upon,</b> <b>as</b> Morgan and Wong believed the series {{would not be}} renewed for a third season and wished to write a suitable ending. The decision to kill off the character of Catherine Black {{was based on a}} suggestion by Chris Carter, the series' creator. Morgan and Wong discussed the idea with actress Megan Gallagher, who felt that it was an interesting decision to have Catherine give her life after seeing Frank Black sacrifice so much for their family throughout the previous episodes. The idea of depicting an apocalyptic scenario as being the result of a virus came from Morgan's research into possible end-of-the-world scenarios, and was influenced by the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|After {{his army}} crossed the Euphrates, {{following}} a route opened up by Lucullus {{over a hundred}} years before, he received envoys from Tiridates and Vologases. At the approach of such a large force, and aware of Corbulo's ability as a general, the two Arsacids were anxious to negotiate. Indeed, Corbulo, no doubt on instructions from Nero, reiterated the old Roman position: if Tiridates would accept his crown from Rome, then renewed war could be averted. Tiridates readily agreed to negotiations, and Rhandeia, the scene of last year's Roman defeat, was agreed <b>upon</b> <b>as</b> a meeting place. To the Armenians, this place was intended as a reminder of their strength, while Corbulo agreed to it because there he hoped to expunge the earlier disgrace, by peace or war. Once there, Corbulo put Paetus' son, who served under him as a legate, in charge of a party that was to gather the remains of the Roman soldiers and ensure them a proper burial. On the agreed day, both Tiridates and Corbulo, each accompanied by 20 horsemen, met between the two camps. Tiridates agreed to travel to Rome and seek confirmation of his crown from Nero. In sign of this agreement, a few days later, both armies put on a display, arrayed in full parade gear. Tiridates approached the Roman camp, where a statue of the Emperor Nero had been erected upon a raised platform, and placed his royal diadem at its feet in submission.|$|E
