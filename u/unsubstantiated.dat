5|$|Living in Pennsylvania {{with his}} wife Corina, Williamson retired in his seventies and died on June 12, 2010, in Upstate New York. Some {{premature}} reports, based on <b>unsubstantiated</b> Twitter claims, erroneously gave June 13, 2010.|$|E
5|$|A {{contradictory}} figure, Caion was {{equated with}} infamy and ridicule in the Romanian context, and his evidently <b>unsubstantiated</b> allegations against Caragiale have traditionally puzzled literary historians. In Transylvania, the word Caion {{was for a}} while synonymous with yellow journalist.|$|E
5|$|Also in August 2014, 4chan was {{involved}} in the Gamergate controversy, which began with <b>unsubstantiated</b> allegations about indie game developer Zoë Quinn from an ex-boyfriend, followed by false allegations from anonymous Internet users. The allegations were followed by a harassment campaign against several women in the video game industry, organized by 4chan users.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, U.S. Congressman William Upshaw, who {{had been}} {{crippled}} {{as the result of}} an accident, claimed he was miraculously healed in a Branham meeting and sent a letter describing his <b>unsubstantiated</b> experience to each member of Congress. Upshaw died the following year.|$|E
5|$|The Choiseul pigeon (Microgoura meeki) is an {{extinct species}} of {{bird in the}} pigeon and dove family, Columbidae. It was endemic to the island of Choiseul in the Solomon Islands, {{although}} there are <b>unsubstantiated</b> reports that it may once have lived on several nearby islands. The last confirmed sighting was in 1904. Other common names were Solomons crested pigeon, Solomon Islands crowned-pigeon and Kuvojo.|$|E
5|$|There was an <b>unsubstantiated</b> {{rumor that}} Lucasfilm {{pressured}} Paramount {{to change the}} film's original working title, The Vengeance of Khan, claiming {{that it was too}} close to the working title for their upcoming Star Wars film. However, as soon as the name change was made, Lucasfilm also changed their title to Return of the Jedi, justifying the change by claiming that the Jedi did not seek revenge, only the Sith.|$|E
5|$|While {{any large}} shark {{is capable of}} inflicting injury and thus merits respect, the common {{thresher}} poses little danger to humans. Most divers report that they are shy and difficult to approach underwater. The International Shark Attack File lists a single provoked attack by the thresher shark and four attacks on boats, which were probably incidental from individuals fighting capture. There is an <b>unsubstantiated</b> report of a common thresher acting aggressively towards a spearfisherman off New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Many {{writers have}} {{attempted}} to designate one person, often Hensley, as the progenitor of Appalachian religious snake handling. Although these writers have emphasized Hensley's role in propagating the practice, Kimbrough notes that claims that he originated it are usually <b>unsubstantiated</b> by research, and {{the origins of the}} observance are unclear. Hood and Williamson argue that the beginnings of Pentecostal snake handling rites cannot be ascribed to a single person, and that the observance arose independently on multiple occasions. There is no doubt among historians, however, that Hensley helped spread Pentecostal snake handling throughout the Southeast, and that media coverage of Hensley's ministry was influential in prompting various churches to include the practice in their services.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil 5 had {{a mostly}} {{positive}} reception, {{although it was}} criticized for problems with its controls. The game received some initial complaints of racism, but {{an investigation by the}} British Board of Film Classification found the complaints were <b>unsubstantiated.</b> Resident Evil 5 was re-released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in June 2016. As of June 2017 it has sold over 7.2 million units, making it Capcom's best-selling game and the best-selling game of the Resident Evil franchise. A special edition of the game, Resident Evil 5: Gold Edition, has sold an additional 2.3 million units. A sequel, Resident Evil 6, was released in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} criticised by big game hunter and {{politician}} Theodore Roosevelt for its central assertion that {{every aspect of}} animal coloration is effective as camouflage. Roosevelt's detailed reply attacked the biased choice of examples to suit Abbott Thayer's thesis and the book's reliance on <b>unsubstantiated</b> claims in place of evidence. The book was more evenly criticised by zoologist and camouflage researcher Hugh Cott, who valued Thayer's work on countershading but regretted his overenthusiastic attempts to explain all animal coloration as camouflage. Thayer was mocked {{to a greater or}} lesser extent by other scientific reviewers.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the {{epaulette}} shark extends from the southern coast of New Guinea to the northern coast of Australia, {{as far south as}} Sydney. The Capricorn-Bunker Group of the Great Barrier Reef contains a particularly large population, with thousands estimated to inhabit the reefs around Heron Island alone. Additionally, there are <b>unsubstantiated</b> reports of this species from Malaysia, Sumatra, and the Solomon Islands. Epaulette sharks are found in shallow water to a maximum depth of 50m (160ft), and are often seen in water barely deep enough to cover their bodies. They prefer tidal pools, coral flats, and stands of staghorn coral.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Biko {{broke his}} banning order by {{travelling}} to Cape Town, hoping to meet Unity Movement leader Neville Alexander {{and deal with}} growing dissent in the Western Cape branch of the BCM, which was dominated by Marxists like Johnny Issel. Biko drove to the city with his Coloured friend Peter Jones on 17 August, but Alexander refused to meet with Biko, fearing {{that he was being}} monitored by the police. Biko and Jones drove back toward King William's Town, but on 18 August they were stopped at a police roadblock near Grahamstown. Biko was arrested for having violated the order restricting him to King William's Town. <b>Unsubstantiated</b> claims have been made that the security services were aware of Biko's trip to Cape Town and that the road block had been erected to catch him. Jones was also arrested at the roadblock; he was subsequently held without trial for 533 days, during which he was interrogated on numerous occasions.|$|E
5|$|The {{subspecies}} P.b.borbonica is resident on Mauritius and Réunion, {{although there}} are local seasonal movements on these island, but the Madagascan subspecies is migratory. The Imerina Plateau is deserted from April to September, the martins moving to lower ground or to the African mainland. It is normally uncommon and local in coastal Mozambique, Zambia, Malawi and Pemba Island, and very rare in Kenya and mainland Tanzania, although large numbers sometimes winter in Mozambique or Malawi. It has also been recorded from Comoros and other Indian Ocean locations including at least four islands in the Seychelles. As of 2012, a total of eight birds had been sighted in the Seychelles, occurring in both the spring and autumn migration periods. Some of these records {{may be due to}} vagrant birds carried by cyclones. There are <b>unsubstantiated</b> claims of occurrences in the Transvaal.|$|E
5|$|Tyler was a slaveholder, at {{one point}} keeping forty slaves at Greenway. Although he {{regarded}} slavery as an evil, and {{did not attempt to}} justify it, he never freed any of his slaves. Tyler considered slavery a part of states’ rights, and therefore the federal government lacked the authority to abolish it. The living conditions of his slaves are not well documented, but historians surmise that he cared for their well-being and abstained from physical violence against them.In December 1841, Tyler was attacked by abolitionist publisher Joshua Leavitt, with the <b>unsubstantiated</b> allegation that Tyler had fathered several sons with his slaves, and later sold them. A number of African American families today maintain a belief in their descent from Tyler, but {{there is no evidence of}} such genealogy.|$|E
5|$|Although {{historically}} <b>unsubstantiated,</b> {{the story}} of how Zoroastrians gained permission to step on the shores of Gujarat continues to be critical to the self-identity of the group. Per the commonly told narrative, the Rajah of Sanjan, summoned them and demanded to know how they wouldn't be a burden on or a threat to the indigenous communities. Replying to their request of practising their religion and till the land, he showed them a jug full of milk, saying Sanjan like it was full. In one version, a dastur added a coin to the milk, saying like the coin, no one would be able to see that they were there but they would enrich the milk nonetheless. In another version, he added sugar instead and claimed that like it, they would sweeten lands of Sanjan. In both of them their settlement is approved by the Rajah who addresses certain conditions for it: they would explain their religion, promise not to prosletyize, adopt Gujarati speech and dress, surrender their weapons and only conduct their rituals after nightfall.|$|E
5|$|Both species {{occur in}} sub-Saharan Africa. The Mascarene martin's {{breeding}} range {{is restricted to}} Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands. The nominate subspecies breeds on Mauritius and Réunion and P. b. madagascariensis occurs in Madagascar. It may also nest on Pemba {{where it has been}} seen in the breeding season. Breeding habitat can be anywhere with suitable sites for constructing a nest, such as ledges, buildings, tunnels, caves or amongst rocks. The martin is found {{on the east side of}} Réunion between , and on the south and west coasts of Mauritius. It also occurs on inland cliffs on Mauritius. P. b. borbonica is resident on Mauritius and Réunion, although there are local seasonal movements on these island, but the Madagascan subspecies is migratory, with the martins moving to lower ground or to the African mainland outside the breeding season. It is normally uncommon and local in coastal Mozambique, Zambia, Malawi and Pemba Island, and very rare in Kenya and mainland Tanzania, although large numbers sometimes winter in Mozambique or Malawi. It has also been recorded from Comoros and other Indian Ocean locations including at least four islands in the Seychelles. Some of these records may be due to vagrant birds carried by cyclones. There are <b>unsubstantiated</b> claims of occurrences in the Transvaal.|$|E
5|$|McCarthyism {{has taken}} on a broader meaning, {{describing}} the excesses of similar efforts. The term is also now used more generally to describe reckless, <b>unsubstantiated</b> accusations, as well as demagogic attacks on the character or patriotism of political adversaries. During the McCarthy era, hundreds of Americans were accused of being communists or communist sympathizers and became the subject of aggressive investigations and questioning before government or private-industry panels, committees and agencies. The primary targets of such suspicions were government employees, those in the entertainment industry, educators and labor union activists. Suspicions were often given credence despite inconclusive or questionable evidence, and the level of threat posed by a person's real or supposed leftist associations or beliefs was sometimes exaggerated. Many people suffered loss of employment or destruction of their careers; some even suffered imprisonment. Most of these punishments came about through trial verdicts later overturned, laws that were later declared unconstitutional, dismissals for reasons later declared illegal or actionable, or extra-legal procedures that would come into general disrepute.|$|E
5|$|On 27 February 2002, the Godhra train burning {{incident}} {{initiated a}} series of riots in Gujarat. Hindu pilgrims returning from Ayodhya on the Sabarmati Express train were attacked and the train, which had stopped at Godhra station, was set on fire causing the death of 58 Hindus including 25 women and 15 childrenactivists of Vishva Hindu Parishad and Kar Sevaks. Following the attack, false rumours were spread by a senior Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader that Muslims had kidnapped three Hindu girls during the incident. Retaliatory attacks on Muslims began the same evening; a number of incidents in which Muslims were attacked and killed were reported in various cities in Gujarat before the Naroda incident. The first attacks on the Muslim community occurred at Ahmedabad, where Hindu mobs began throwing stones and later burnt Gulbarg Society, a Muslim housing complex. The initial violence {{was believed to be}} instigated by the <b>unsubstantiated</b> rumours about Muslims kidnapping three Hindu girls. Violence spread to the largely rural districts of Panchmahal, Mehsana, Kheda, Junagadh, Banaskantha, Patan, Anand and Narmada the next day.|$|E
5|$|A reformist, Dunstan brought {{profound}} {{change to}} South Australian society. His socially progressive administration saw Aboriginal land rights recognised, homosexuality decriminalised, {{the first female}} judge appointed, the first non-British governor, Sir Mark Oliphant, and later, the first indigenous governor Sir Douglas Nicholls. He enacted consumer protection laws, reformed and expanded the public education and health systems, abolished the death penalty, relaxed censorship and drinking laws, created a ministry for the environment, enacted anti-discrimination law, and implemented electoral reforms such as the overhaul of the Legislative Council of parliament, lowered the voting age to 18, enacted universal suffrage, and completely abolished malapportionment, changes which gave him a less hostile parliament and allowed him to enact his reforms. He established Rundle Mall, enacted measures to protect buildings of historical heritage, and encouraged a flourishing of the arts, with support for the Adelaide Festival Centre, the State Theatre Company, {{and the establishment of}} the South Australian Film Corporation. He encouraged cultural exchanges with Asia, multiculturalism and an increase in the state's culinary awareness and sophistication. He is recognised for his role in reinvigorating the social, artistic and cultural life of South Australia during his nine years in office, remembered as the Dunstan Decade. However, there were also problems; the economy began to stagnate, and the large increases to burgeoning public service generated claims of waste. One of Dunstan's pet projects, a plan to build a new city at Monarto to alleviate urban pressures in Adelaide, was abandoned when economic and population growth stalled, with much money and planning already invested. After four consecutive election wins, Dunstan's administration began to falter in 1978 following his dismissal of Police Commissioner Harold Salisbury, as controversy broke out over whether he had improperly interfered with a judicial investigation. In addition, policy problems and unemployment began to mount, as well as <b>unsubstantiated</b> rumours of corruption and personal impropriety. Dunstan became increasingly short-tempered, and the strain was increased by the death of his second wife. His resignation from the premiership and politics in 1979 was abrupt after collapsing due to ill health, but he would live for another 20 years, remaining a vocal and outspoken campaigner for progressive social policy.|$|E

25|$|An <b>unsubstantiated</b> {{claim on}} the Horsted Keynes Village Web Site purports to show photos of the trail left after an unusual sonic boom was heard over the village in July 2002. In 2005 the {{information}} was used in a BBC report about the Aurora project.|$|E
25|$|A lieutenant-general in 1777, {{he became}} lieutenant-governor of Menorca, 1779–82, until {{the island was}} lost to the French and Spanish in the Battle of Menorca. He {{preferred}} <b>unsubstantiated</b> charges of misconduct against Lieutenant General James Murray, who had suspended him. He was reprimanded by a general court martial in 1783.|$|E
25|$|Between his {{appointment}} and the election, Debnam never quite shook {{the perception that}} under Brogden or O'Farrell, the party would have performed much better.
