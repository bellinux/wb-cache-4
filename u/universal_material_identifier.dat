These models, often represented as complex triangle meshes, challenge rendering performance, transmission bandwidth, and storage capacities. This paper introduces the progressive mesh (PM) representation, a new scheme for storing and transmitting arbitrary triangle meshes. This efficient, lossless, continuous-resolution representation addresses several practical problems in graphics: smooth geomorphing of level-of-detail approximations, progressive transmission, mesh compression, and selective refinement. In addition, {{we present a}} new mesh simplification procedure for constructing a PM representation from an arbitrary mesh. The goal of this optimization procedure is to preserve not just the geometry of the original mesh, but more importantly its overall appearance as defined by its discrete and scalar appearance attributes such as <b>material</b> <b>identifiers,</b> color values, normals, and texture coordinates. We demonstrate construction of the PM representation and its applications using several practical models...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a measuring system for different instruments and manipulations in LESS using a single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) port. Methods: The loads on the SILS port were applied and recorded by the <b>universal</b> <b>material</b> testing machine by the following method. The handle of the forceps inserted in the SILS port was connected with the machine by a fishing wire and pulled at a constant rate. The surface deforma-tions (displacements and strains) of the SILS port were recorded with digital image correlation (DIC) simultane-ously. The correlation between deformation measure-ments and loads were analyzed. This experiment was repeated 8 times. Results: Strong correlations existed between deforma-tion measurements calculated by DIC and objective criteria “loads ” applied and recorded by the <b>universal</b> <b>material</b> testing machine (r 0. 98). The correlation coefficients were statistically significant (P. 001). A high repeatability of the results appeared in all repeti-tions of the experiment.

40|$|Owing to {{two reasons}} the {{currently}} accepted values 0. 3 and 0. 7 of the <b>universal</b> <b>material</b> and dark energy densities, deduced from the Hubble diagrams of high redshift Ia type supernovae, {{need to be}} revised. The first is that the formula {{used to calculate the}} cosmic redshift at present is actually that of gravitational redshift, in spite of the Doppler redshift. Based on the Friedmann equation of cosmology directly, we can easy deduce the formula of the Doppler redshift for the flat universe. It is completely different from the current formula used to calculate cosmic redshift. So we should take into account of both the Doppler and gravitational effects simultaneously in the problems of cosmology. In this way, the hypothesis of non-baryon dark material would become unnecessary. The second is that the observed Doppler redshift and luminosity distance of supernovae actually represent the past time values, in spite of the present-day values. But the theoretical curves are drawn based on the present-day values. So the theoretical curves can not compare with observational results directly. In order to fit them consistently, we should transform the observational values which indicate the past states of supernovae into that of the present-day states. In this way, the currently accepted values of the <b>universal</b> <b>material</b> and dark energy densities would be sizably changed and the theory of cosmography would be affected greatly...|$|R

Some standard lattice parts were designed according to the Chinese GB/T 1452 - 2005 standard and manufactured by SLM. Then these samples were tested in an MTS Insight 30 compression testing machine to study the trends of the yield process with different structure sizes. A set of standard cylinder samples were also designed according to the Chinese GB/T 228 - 2010 standard. These samples, which were made of iron-nickel alloy (IN 718), were also processed by SLM, and then tested in the <b>universal</b> <b>material</b> testing machine INSTRON 1346 to obtain their tensile strength. Furthermore, a lightweight redesigned method was researched. Then some common parts such as a stopper and connecting plate were redesigned using this method. These redesigned parts were fabricated and some application tests have already been performed. The compression testing results show that when the minimum structure size is larger than 1. 5 mm, the mechanical characteristics will hardly be affected by process defects. The cylinder parts were fractured by the <b>universal</b> <b>material</b> testing machine at about 1069. 6 MPa.

Illusory and technological determinism have also failed in identifying the aesthetic nature of the pixel materiality as not only characterized and determined by the technological materiality of the medium but also by the aesthetic choice of a blurred representation of the immediate existence of an event or action across the globe.
