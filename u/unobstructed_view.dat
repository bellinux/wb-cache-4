5|$|Compared to {{standard}} telescopic sights, a reflector sight {{can be held}} at any distance from the eye (does not require a designed eye relief), and at almost any angle, without distorting {{the image of the}} target or reticle. They are often used with both eyes open (the brain will tend to automatically superimpose the illuminated reticle image coming from the dominant eye onto the other eye's <b>unobstructed</b> <b>view),</b> giving the shooter normal depth perception and full field of view. Since Reflector sights are not dependent on eye relief, they can theoretically be placed in any mechanically-convenient mounting position on a weapon.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the machine was very complicated and designed to mislead those who observed it. When opened on the left, the front doors of the cabinet exposed a number of gears and cogs similar to clockwork. The section was designed so that if the back doors of the cabinet were open {{at the same time}} one could see through the machine. The other side of the cabinet did not house machinery; instead it contained a red cushion and some removable parts, as well as brass structures. This area was also designed to provide a clear line of vision through the machine. Underneath the robes of the Ottoman model, two other doors were hidden. These also exposed clockwork machinery and provided a similarly <b>unobstructed</b> <b>view</b> through the machine. The design allowed the presenter of the machine to open every available door to the public, to maintain the illusion.|$|E
5|$|However, {{although}} the spectators {{would now be}} able to see the players at night, they still suffered from the problem of obstructed views caused by the pillars that supported the roofs. With the 1966 FIFA World Cup fast approaching, this prompted the United directors to completely redesign the United Road (north) stand. The old roof pillars were replaced in 1965 with modern-style cantilevering on top of the roof, allowing every spectator a completely <b>unobstructed</b> <b>view,</b> while it was also expanded to hold 20,000 spectators (10,000 seated and 10,000 standing in front) at a cost of £350,000. The architects of the new stand, Mather and Nutter (now Atherden Fuller), rearranged the organisation of the stand to have terracing at the front, a larger seated area towards the back, and the first private boxes at a British football ground. The east stand – the only remaining uncovered stand – was developed in the same style in 1973. With the first two stands converted to cantilevers, the club's owners devised a long-term plan to do the same to the other two stands and convert the stadium into a bowl-like arena. Such an undertaking would serve to increase the atmosphere within the ground by containing the crowd's noise and focusing it onto the pitch, where the players would feel the full effects of a capacity crowd. Meanwhile, the stadium hosted its third FA Cup Final, hosting 62,078 spectators for the replay of the 1970 final between Chelsea and Leeds United; Chelsea won the match 2–1. The ground also hosted the second leg of the 1968 Intercontinental Cup, which saw Estudiantes de La Plata win the cup after a 1–1 draw. The 1970s saw the dramatic rise of football hooliganism in Britain, and a knife-throwing incident in 1971 forcing the club to erect the country's first perimeter fence, restricting fans from the Old Trafford pitch.|$|E

25|$|At {{one time}} Pennsylvania Avenue {{provided}} an <b>unobstructed</b> <b>view</b> between the White House and the Capitol. The {{construction of an}} expansion to the Treasury Building blocked this view, and supposedly President Andrew Jackson did this on purpose.

25|$|When {{originally}} constructed, {{the address}} of the building was 2 East 86th Street. During its renovation, the building owners applied to the Manhattan Borough President's office for an address change, citing the fact that all floors above the seventh provide an <b>unobstructed</b> <b>view</b> of Central Park. This was for marketing purposes, due to the additional value that accrues to real estate with a Fifth Avenue address. Such changes are unusual but not unheard of, and are granted if deemed justified.|$|E

25|$|During the Ten Days' Campaign {{undertaken}} by the Dutch in 1830 after the Belgian Revolution, a Dutch garrison bombarded Antwerp. The church was damaged and all the 17th century stained glass windows, made after designs by Abraham van Diepenbeeck, were destroyed. In 1833 {{the interior of the}} church was changed: the rood screen dating from 1654, which had been executed by Pieter Verbruggen II and his workshop was dismantled to allow an <b>unobstructed</b> <b>view</b> through the nave to the choir. A new rood screen had previously been built on the western side of the nave.|$|E
25|$|The HUD {{has also}} been altered. Egosoft removed {{non-functional}} internal cockpit graphics, giving the player a largely <b>unobstructed</b> <b>view</b> of space. There are now markers over game objects such as ships, stations and large asteroids, and each object is selectable by a simple mouse click, or through a keyboard or controller. X3 uses a new interface designed to be faster, more user friendly, and compatible with a console controller. The game carries over {{many of the same}} short-cut keys from previous games, but now the mouse too can be used for functions including menu navigation, target selection, flying and combat.|$|E
25|$|Lakeview {{was used}} as a camp and trail path for the Miami, Ottawa, and Winnebago Native American tribes. In 1837, Conrad Sulzer of Winterthur, Zürich, Switzerland, became the first known white settler to live in the area. In 1853, one of the first {{permanent}} structures was built by James Rees and Elisha Hundley on the corner where present-day West Byron Street (or West Sheridan Road) meets North Lake Shore Drive and was called the Hotel Lakeview, named for the hotel's <b>unobstructed</b> <b>view</b> of the shore of Lake Michigan. It gained what was characterized as a resort atmosphere.|$|E

25|$|When {{it opened}} in 1967, Tampa Stadium {{consisted}} of a matching pair of large arch-shaped concrete grandstands with open endzones. The seating consisted of long, backless aluminum benches that were accessed via short tunnels (vomitoriums) which connected the seating area to wide, open concourses {{at the rear of}} the grandstands. The benches were arranged in two large tiers divided by a horizontal walkway about halfway up the grandstands. The slope of the grandstands was relatively steep, giving every seat a direct and <b>unobstructed</b> <b>view</b> of the field. The official capacity was 46,481, though temporary bleachers could be placed in one or both endzones if needed.|$|E
25|$|The Overseas Passenger Terminal {{is located}} {{along the western}} edge of {{waterfront}} which frames Sydney Cove, also known as Circular Quay West and forms part of the promenade between Circular Quay station and First Fleet Park to the South and Campbell's Cove to the north. Its geographical location along the water's edge provides the structure with a clear, <b>unobstructed</b> <b>view</b> of two of Sydney's most recognisable icons, the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Sydney Opera House. Its location also borders along the eastern edge of one of Sydney's earliest colonial settlement areas, known as The Rocks and today is on the border of a heritage conservation area which protects this historically significant zone.|$|E
25|$|Each {{receiver}} must {{be connected}} to an external antenna, which is included with the receiver. Antenna placement is crucial to receiving a clear signal. In some locations users have experienced difficulty receiving the Sirius programming because the signal is not consistently strong. For best reception, antennas should be placed such {{that they have an}} <b>unobstructed</b> <b>view</b> of the sky (preferably on rooftops without overhanging eaves or trees). If this is not an option, the antenna should be placed on an exterior wall. When placing on an exterior wall, the antenna should be mounted to a wall which faces the center of the continental United States in order to minimize the likelihood of the building itself blocking the signal.|$|E
