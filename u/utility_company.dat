5000|$|Net {{metering}} in Arizona is {{a public}} policy and political issue regarding the rates that Arizona <b>utility</b> <b>companies</b> pay solar customers sell excess energy back to the electrical grid. The issue has two political sides: <b>utility</b> <b>companies</b> that to pay solar customers the [...] "wholesale rate" [...] for their excess electricity, and solar panel installers and solar customers who want <b>utility</b> <b>companies</b> to pay the [...] "retail rate" [...] (higher than the wholesale rate).|$|R
5|$|After {{the lodge}} was completed, {{it was decided}} to build a {{restaurant}} and breezeway onto the lodge building. Logs for most of the project were shipped via railroad {{from as far away as}} Oregon and Washington state, unloaded in Stratford, Illinois and dragged to the construction site by teams of horses. The CCC project also completed sixteen one-room log cabins and three four-bedroom cabins. The work crews also built picnic shelters, trail shelters, and foot bridges. Only the logs for the cabins came from another source. They were purchased from a salvage company that had purchased utility poles from a defunct <b>utility</b> <b>company</b> at the price of 30 cents a piece.|$|E
5|$|Despite his popularity, Goldschmidt {{left office}} after only one term, {{becoming}} an influential and controversial lobbyist. Over the next dozen years or so, he was criticized by editorial boards and Oregonians for {{several of the}} causes he supported, including backing the forestry corporation, Weyerhaeuser in its hostile takeover of Oregon's Willamette Industries and his advocacy for a private investment firm {{in its attempt to}} take over Portland General Electric, a local <b>utility</b> <b>company.</b> In 2003, Governor Ted Kulongoski appointed him to the Oregon Board of Higher Education, a position he resigned after admitting he had a sexual relationship with a minor girl 30 years earlier.|$|E
5|$|At an eco {{hotel in}} the desert, Greene tells Medrano that now he {{controls}} the majority of Bolivia's water supply, Medrano must accept a new contract that makes Greene Planet Bolivia's sole water <b>utility</b> <b>company</b> at significantly higher rates. Bond infiltrates the complex, kills {{the chief of police}} (Fernando Guill√©n Cuervo) for betraying Mathis, and single-handedly assaults the hotel. After killing the security detail, he confronts Greene. Meanwhile, Camille kills Medrano, avenging the murders of her family. The struggle leaves the hotel destroyed by fire. Bond captures Greene and interrogates him about Quantum, leaving him stranded in the desert with only a can of engine oil, wondering if Greene will get thirsty enough to drink it.|$|E
50|$|It {{reformed}} the Public <b>Utility</b> Holding <b>Company</b> Act of 1935 (PUHCA) to help small <b>utility</b> <b>companies</b> stay {{competitive with}} larger utilities and amended the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) of 1978, broadening {{the range of}} resource choices for <b>utility</b> <b>companies</b> and outlined new rate-making standards. It also amended parts of the Federal Power Act of 1935 (Title VII).|$|R

5|$|Malaysia's energy {{infrastructure}} sector is largely dominated by Tenaga Nasional, the largest electric <b>utility</b> <b>company</b> in Southeast Asia, with over RM99.03 billion of assets. Customers {{are connected to}} electricity through the National Grid, with more than 420 transmission substations in the Peninsular linked together by approximately 11,000km of transmission lines operating at 132, 275 and 500 kilovolts. In 2013, Malaysia's total power generation capacity was over 29,728 megawatts. Total electricity generation was 140,985.01 GWh and total electricity consumption was 116,087.51 GWh. Energy production in Malaysia is largely based on oil and natural gas, owing to Malaysia's oil reserves and natural gas reserves, which is the fourth largest in Asia-Pacific after China, India and Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after leaving}} the Edison company, Tesla was working on {{patenting}} an arc lighting system, possibly the same one he had developed at Edison. In March 1885, he met with patent attorney Lemuel W. Serrell, the same attorney used by Edison, to obtain help with submitting the patents. Serrell introduced Tesla to two businessmen, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an arc lighting manufacturing and <b>utility</b> <b>company</b> in Tesla's name, the Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing. Tesla worked {{for the rest of}} the year obtaining the patents that included an improved DC generator, the first patents issued to Tesla in the US, and building and installing the system in Rahway, New Jersey Tesla's new system gained notice in the technical press, which commented on its advanced features.|$|E
5|$|The {{focus of}} the company began to switch away from purely {{construction}} and towards more turnkey work and service provision, for example the 1961-3 Hilton Hotel, Athens, project. Most work was domestic, driven by Germany's strong economic growth, with a particular strength in power plant construction. This included {{the construction of the}} Federal Republic of Germany's first nuclear power plant, Kahl Nuclear Power Plant, near Dettingen am Main. The construction contract had been awarded by AEG, which had been commissioned by the <b>utility</b> <b>company</b> RWE to build the plant. The plant began to feed its electricity to the grid in June 1961. By contrast, the first East German nuclear plant, at Rheinsberg, was connected to the grid in 1966.|$|E
50|$|While many {{environmentalists and}} {{conservation}} advocates support decoupling, many consumer advocates representing utility ratepayers have opposed decoupling as {{it attempts to}} guarantee revenue levels to <b>utility</b> <b>companies.</b> Decoupling mechanisms reduce a <b>utility</b> <b>company's</b> financial risk from reducing sales, due to conservation, weather and economic conditions. As a result, many consumer advocates have requested and state and federal regulators have required that <b>utility</b> <b>companies</b> profit levels (measured through a return on equity allowance) be reduced to reflect lower risk.|$|R
5000|$|The federal Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act {{makes it}} {{mandatory}} for <b>utility</b> <b>companies</b> to purchase renewable energy from independent power developers. HB589 would allow <b>utility</b> <b>companies</b> {{to work with}} state regulators to propose a program that would [...] "procure renewable energy at a competitive rate." [...] <b>Utility</b> <b>companies</b> would then be allowed to compete and bid against third-party energy developers. Duke Energy proposed a measure in 2016 {{that is similar to}} the bill (the North Carolina Utilities Commission rejected a similar measure in 2014).|$|R

5|$|On termination, the Menominee, {{which was}} one of the wealthiest tribes prior to termination, became one of the poorest. In 1954, the tribe's timber {{operations}} allowed it to be self-sufficient. The tribe, which owned utility companies, paid for a hospital, BIA salaries, local schools, and a stipend to tribal members. The tribe was forced to use its reserve funds to develop a termination plan that they did not want and instead of having a reserve, they entered into termination with a $300,000 deficit. Menominee County was created out of the old reservation boundaries and the tribe immediately had to finance its own police and fire protection. Without federal support and with no tax base, the situation became dire. The tribe closed the hospital, sold its <b>utility</b> <b>company,</b> and contracted those services to neighboring counties. The Menominee Enterprises, Inc., formed to care for the tribe's needs after termination, was unable to pay property taxes and began to consider selling off tribal property. Many Menominee tribal members believed that the sponsor of the termination bill, Senator Arthur Wilkins of Utah, intended to force the loss of rich tribal lands to non-Indians. In 1962, the state of Wisconsin took the position that the hunting and fishing rights were abrogated by the termination act and that the tribal members were subject to state hunting and fishing regulations. With the poverty in the former reservation, the loss of hunting rights meant the loss of one of their last remaining means of survival.|$|E
5|$|The {{interiors}} were {{filmed in}} two specially converted aircraft hangars near Bury St. Edmunds in Suffolk, which were leased for ¬£1,500; this cost-measure resulted {{in much of}} the dialogue having to be re-recorded later, because the tin roofs of the hangars caused an echo. The exterior shots range from the Dunwich Coast (for the scene with the fisherman) to Langley Park outside London (for the scene where Stearne escapes capture). The tracking shot of the ambush after the opening credits was filmed at Black Park in southeast Buckinghamshire, a location frequently used by Hammer Film Productions. Lavenham Square (in Lavenham, Suffolk), site of the witch-burning scene, was the real Lavenham Market Square; the crew lowered TV antennas and telephone wires and Waddilove hired a cherry picker from a local <b>utility</b> <b>company</b> for ¬£10, because the unit couldn't afford a camera crane. The countryside vistas seen in the chase scenes on horseback were shot on the Stanford Battle Area near Thetford, Norfolk‚Äî the producer, through connections with the government, was able to lease parts of the area. The church used in the film is St John The Evangelist in Rushford in Norfolk. The moat drowning and hanging scenes were filmed at Kentwell Hall, in Long Melford. The climax of the film was shot at Orford Castle, on the coast of East Anglia, which is an English Heritage property. Filming wrapped as scheduled on 13 November 1967.|$|E
