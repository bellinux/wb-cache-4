40|$|Minimum Rate Maximization (MRM) is a link {{adaptation}} {{strategy that}} guarantees a minimum quality of service, {{in terms of}} instantaneous signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, to all users in a DS-CDMA system. This is achieved by power and rate allocation that maximizes the minimum <b>user</b> <b>information</b> <b>rate.</b> As MRM resource allocation relies on knowledge of the channel coefficients, the achievable quality of service suffers from a degradation when the channel is dynamic and imperfectly estimated. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to add Auto-Regressive channel prediction to compensate for the Doppler-induced channel time-variations and improve the performance of the MRM strategy. 1...|$|E
40|$|Minimum Rate Maximization (MRM) is a link {{adaptation}} {{strategy for}} CDMA-based {{systems such as}} UMTS. It offers to all users on the uplink a minimum QoS, {{in terms of a}} target Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), regardless of their respective fadings. This is achieved by appropriate power and rate allocation that maximizes the minimum <b>user</b> <b>information</b> <b>rate.</b> Auto-Regressive channel prediction was proposed to improve MRM robustness to imperfect channel knowledge. The prediction yields better average minimum SINR. However, this enhancement is limited by the channel estimation errors. This paper proposes a new channel gain estimator and shows that the prediction error variance is minimized for a given AR order...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is twofold. First, we introduce a new efficient analytical method for uplink performance estimation in multi-service UMTS networks by taking the dynamic behaviour of the user transmission rate into account. Our performance measures are the average <b>user</b> <b>information</b> <b>rate</b> and the blocking probability of new calls. Next, a traffic management technique is applied to UMTS and incorporated into the analytical approach to specify how resources have to be adequately engineered to meet quantitative performance objectives. For this we investigate the joint behaviour of the admission control characteristics, scheduling, threshold and reservation scheme for UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) in terms of their agreement with Grade of Service (GoS) requirements. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated. I...|$|E

30|$|In {{the context}} of {{frame-based}} multimedia wireless transmission, a link adaptation strategy is proposed, assuming that the source decoder may accept some remaining errors at {{the output of the}} channel decoder. Based on a target mean bit error rate for erroneous frames, a minimum bit-energy-to-equivalent-noise ratio is chosen. Under this constraint, a new link adaptation criterion is proposed: the maximization of the minimum <b>user's</b> <b>information</b> <b>rate</b> through dynamic spreading gain and power control, allowing to guarantee a transmission for each and every user. An analytical solution to this constrained optimization problem is proposed and its performance is studied in a Rayleigh-fading environment.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Nanotechnology is {{providing}} {{a new set}} of tools to the engineering community to design and manufacture integrated devices just a few hundred nanometers in total size. Communication among these nano-devices will boost the range of applications of nanotechnology in several fields, ranging from biomedical research to military technology or environmental science. Within the alternatives for communication, recent developments in nanomaterials point to the Terahertz band (0. 1 - 10 THz) as the frequency range of operation of future electromagnetic nanotransceivers. This frequency band supports very large bit-rates in the short range and enables simple communication mechanisms suited to the limited capabilities of nano-devices, such as pulse-based communications. However, the expectedly very large number of nano-devices and the unfeasibility to coordinate them can make interference a major impairment. In this paper, low-weight channel coding is proposed as a novel mechanism to reduce interference in pulse-based nanonetworks. Rather than utilizing channel codes to detect and correct transmission errors, it is shown that by appropriately choosing the weight of a code, interference is mitigated and the number of transmission errors is reduced. The performance of the proposed scheme is analytically and numerically investigated both in terms of overall interference reduction and achievable information rate, by utilizing a new statistical model for the interference. The results show that this network-friendly channel coding scheme can be used to alleviate the interference problem in nanonetworks without compromising the individual <b>user</b> <b>information</b> <b>rate...</b>|$|E

The potential maximization of transmitted data rates shall be strived for by spatial multiplexing. In particular, high data rates in the downlink have been considered desirable. Also, in view of an efficient implementation, the downlink requires a thorough assessment. Therefore, the authors will thoroughly consider the theoretical performance of data detection techniques for spatial multiplexing in the UTRA LTE downlink in this communication. Setting out from a discrete-time system model, a generalized model {{for the evaluation of}} the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the data detector output will be introduced and applied to the performance evaluation of both linear as well as V-BLAST (Vertical Bell Labs Layered Space Time) data detection techniques. Furthermore their performance will be compared with theoretical bounds of the matched filter and the maximum-likelihood (ML) receivers. It will show that the performance of successive interference cancellation (SIC) based data detection techniques for MIMO-OFDM is beneficial...|$|R

However,on internet all the online users cannot recognize each other the way they do in real life. In E-commerce system where transaction is made and money is involved,the reliability of a seller holds a substantial amount of importance. Hence,there are many trust and reputation systems are introduced for e-commerce system. However,many of the existing systems are based on the simple calculation which is vulnerable to user manipulations. This may increase the chances of dishonest rating and reduce the reliability of the reputation system. This project aims to overcome this problem by applying fuzzy logic in the reputation system. By using fuzzy logic to compute a weight based on the <b>user‘s</b> <b>information,</b> each <b>rating</b> is multiplied with different weight. This can increase the difficulty of manipulation by dishonest users and increase the reliability of the system. The result of applying fuzzy logic shows that it can indeed prevent certain scenarios of dishonest manipulation in user rating...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} how <b>information</b> <b>rate</b> in a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) wireless communication system {{is affected by}} the use of non-Gaussian source distributions. Of particular interest is the comparison of <b>information</b> <b>rate</b> for a legitimate receiver with that available to an eavesdropping receiver, as the source distribution becomes less Gaussian or, equivalently, as the magnitude of the source kurtosis increases. A legitimate receiver will usually be able to perform maximum likelihood channel estimation using knowledge of a symbol training sequence embedded in the transmitted data. An eavesdropper however may not have this prior knowledge and will therefore be unable to directly estimate the channel. We compare, via simulations, the performance of a well-known Blind Source Separation (BSS) algorithm with theoretically derived results and where the source distributions are taken from the discrete digital constellations: Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM), Phase Shift Keying (PSK). By incorporating a sample timing offset in the simulations we show how the kurtosis of these digital sources is altered. We also show how the legitimate <b>user</b> and eavesdropper <b>information</b> <b>rates</b> are affected as the source kurtosis is varied...|$|R
40|$|Traditional Recommender Systems (RS) do not {{consider}} any personal <b>user</b> <b>information</b> beyond <b>rating</b> history. Such <b>information,</b> on the other hand, is widely available on social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter). As a result, social networks have recently been used in recommendation systems. In this paper, we propose an efficient method for incorporating social signals into the recommendation process by building a trust network which supplements the users' rating profiles. We first show the effect of different cold-start users types on the Collaborative Filtering (CF) technique in several real-world datasets. Later, we propose a "Trust-Aware Neighbourhood" algorithm which addresses a performance issue of the former by limiting the trusted neighbourhood. We show the doubling of the rating coverage compared to the traditional CF technique, and a significant improvement in the accuracy for some datasets. Focusing specifically on cold-start users, we propose a "Hybrid Trust-Aware Neighbourhood" algorithm which expands the neighbourhood by considering both trust and rating history of the users. We show a near complete coverage with a rich trust network dataset [...] Flixster. We conclude by discussing the potential implementation of this algorithm in a budget-constrained cloud environment...|$|R

To efficiently estimate the relevance between the <b>user</b> <b>information</b> need and documents, the <b>user</b> <b>information</b> need is treated as a rough set on the space of documents. The rough set decision theory is used to classify the new documents according to the <b>user</b> <b>information</b> need.
