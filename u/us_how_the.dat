[...] "Eventually, when other fossil records are found, Sedna will help tell <b>us</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> Sun formed {{and the number of}} stars that were close to the Sun when it formed." [...] A 2007–2008 survey by Brown, Rabinowitz and Megan Schwamb attempted to locate another member of Sedna's hypothetical population. Although the survey was sensitive to movement out to 1,000AU and discovered the likely dwarf planet , it detected no new sednoid. Subsequent simulations incorporating the new data suggested about 40 Sedna-sized objects probably exist in this region, with the brightest being about Eris's magnitude (−1.0).|$|E
