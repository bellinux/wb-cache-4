5|$|On {{his last}} day, after oversleeping, Homer {{attempts}} {{to do all}} the things on his list. He has a man-to-man talk with Bart, listens to Lisa play her saxophone, and borrows Ned's camcorder to make a video for Maggie that she can look at when she is older. Next, Homer reconciles with his father Grampa, which takes up far more time than he expects and forces him to give <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> some of the things on his list. After trying to catch up on time he lost doing these things, Homer is arrested for speeding. He calls Barney, who is asked to pay $50 to bail him out. After being acquitted, he tells off his boss Mr. Burns and has one last drink at Moe's Tavern with his friends, causing him to miss dinner with his waiting family.

5|$|While Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{is having}} a meeting with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) in his office, Robert California (James Spader) appears {{at the window and}} frantically says that his wife Susan (Maura Tierney) is looking for a job in the office, and that Andy must not give her one. When Susan arrives, Andy {{compliantly}} tells her that they have no openings, but Robert insists that they have a look around before coming to any conclusions. Susan looks at the different departments, and decides on accounting. Andy again claims the office is already fully staffed, but Robert insists that he give her a job, even pressuring Andy by reminding him of his power as CEO. Confused by Robert's mixed messages, Andy relents and gives her a job, but Robert later calls Andy on the phone to berate him for hiring Susan. Andy asks everyone in the office to treat her poorly to drive her out, which makes everyone uncomfortable as they like her, but end <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> so nevertheless. When Susan notices their behavior, she complains to Robert, who asks Andy to discuss the issues with Susan in the conference room and leaves. Susan eventually realizes it was Robert's idea to drive her away. When they call Robert out, he vehemently denies it. Andy tells them Jim also heard him say he did not want her working at the office, which Jim overhears, prompting him to flee the office. Robert orders security to close the gate, preventing him from leaving. Jim then runs all over the building, but Andy and Robert find him and take him back to the office. After trying unsuccessfully to deflect their questions about what Robert told Andy, Jim blurts out that he is baffled at Robert's attitude, since Jim enjoys working in the same place as his wife Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) and misses her while she is on maternity leave. Andy and Jim leave the conference room and after a short while, Robert and Susan leave. In the parking lot, Andy apologizes to Susan and after brief small talk, Susan asks Andy out on a date, leaving him surprised.|$|E

25|$|Manu (Frank Welker) - A mischievous baby baboon, who is {{fascinated with}} humans, and, {{when no one}} is looking, he is irresistibly drawn to rummaging through their {{belongings}} and trying on their clothes. He may even run off with a shiny keepsake or two. Like an inquisitive child, he leaves a mess behind, which means a red-faced Tarzan and the other family members are usually stuck with cleaning up after him. His mischief, however, sometimes ends <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> more good than first assumed, especially where the villainous Samuel Philander was concerned.|$|E

25|$|The {{legal dispute}} between Black Flag and Unicorn tied the band up {{for almost two}} years, during which time they {{released}} Everything Went Black, a double album of pre-Rollins outtakes, under {{the names of the}} individual musicians and vocalists on the record. Unicorn ended up filing even more legal briefs, claiming that Black Flag had violated a court injunction against releasing new records. Ginn and Dukowski ended <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> several days in Los Angeles County Jail for contempt of court, but the case fizzled out soon afterward when Unicorn went out of business, freeing Black Flag of any further obligation to the label.|$|E

25|$|David Seltzer {{wrote the}} first draft for Punchline in 1979 after {{becoming}} fascinated by comedy clubs while {{looking for someone to}} play a psychiatrist on a television pilot that he was writing. He had a development deal with the movie division of ABC. Originally, the tone of the film was more good-natured a la Fame (1980) with more characters and less of an emphasis on Steven Gold. Bob Bookman, an executive, sponsored the script but left for Columbia Pictures. He bought the screenplay because Howard Zieff was interested in directing it. When Zieff lost interest (he ended <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> Unfaithfully Yours in 1984), the script was buried for years.|$|E

This {{included}} carrying the decapitated body of Richard III and sleeping with the Spanish Infanta, Edmund's fiancée, making her unchaste in hopes that this would prevent the marriage.

25|$|Fulci and screenwriter Dardano Sacchetti {{share many}} screen credits from 1977 to 1983. Indeed, most of Fulci's most celebrated horror films {{were written by}} Sacchetti. After collaborating with Sacchetti for six years, Fulci went off on his own in 1983 to direct Conquest in Mexico, failing to involve Sacchetti in the deal. The film was {{supposed}} to be a high budget production, and Sacchetti allegedly resented the fact that Fulci had not thought to involve him in the project. The film actually wound <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> quite poorly upon its release, and afterwards, Fulci had trouble jump-starting his working relationship with Sacchetti, who by this time had gone his own way.|$|E
25|$|When Canada {{declared}} war in 1939, women felt obligated {{to help the}} fight. In October 1938, the Women’s Volunteer Service was established in Victoria, British Columbia. A recruitment event was held in hopes of gaining around 20 new volunteers; over 100 women arrived to join the efforts. Shortly after, more British Columbian women {{felt the need to}} do their part, and when the 13 corps joined together the B.C. Women’s Service Corps was created. Soon after, all the other Canadian provinces and territories followed suit and similar volunteer groups emerged. “Husbands, brothers, fathers, boyfriends were all joining <b>up,</b> <b>doing</b> something to help win the war. Surely women could help as well!” In addition to the Red Cross, several volunteer corps had designed themselves after auxiliary groups from Britain. These corps had uniforms, marching drills and a few had rifle training. It soon was clear, that a unified governing system would be beneficial to the corps. The volunteers in British Columbia donated $2 each to pay the expenses so a representative could talk to politicians in Ottawa. Although all of the politicians appeared sympathetic to the cause, it remained ‘premature’ in terms of national necessity.|$|E
