40|$|Introduction: Patient {{immobilisation}} {{is critically}} important for both highly conformal conventionally fractionated radiotherapy and for stereotactic body radiotherapy. Different immobilisation devices are available to maintain patient position for radiotherapy but the most suitable one remains unknown. Methods: Forty-five patients were randomly allocated {{to one of three}} immobilisation devices; the Q fix arm shuttle, BodyFIX <b>without</b> <b>wrap</b> or BodyFIX with wrap. Patients were imaged before and after treatment to ascertain intra-fraction and inter-fraction motion. Bony anatomy was used for matching to determine the positional accuracy of each device. Treatments were timed using a standard method. Patient comfort and staff satisfaction questionnaires were also issued to determine comfort, ease of use and preferences for each device. Results: The BodyFIX <b>without</b> <b>wrap</b> was the more accurate device; however, the differences between the devices were not statistically significant. The BodyFIX with wrap was found to take significantly longer to set up and set down compared to the arm shuttle and the BodyFIX <b>without</b> <b>wrap</b> (all P < 0. 001). Patients (37 %) marginally preferred the BodyFIX with wrap. Most (81 %) staff preferred the BodyFIX <b>without</b> <b>wrap.</b> Conclusion: Immobilisation using the BodyFIX <b>without</b> <b>wrap</b> was deemed to be suitable for clinical use. It was a clinically accurate device, the more efficient in terms of set up and set down time, the most preferred by staff and was accepted by patients...|$|R

60|$|Well, time ran on, {{and there}} came a time when I was able to gratify one of my {{youthful}} ambitions--I could buy the choicest Havana <b>cigars</b> <b>without</b> seriously interfering with my income.

60|$|Somewhat to the {{surprise}} of the habitués of the room below it was nearly eleven o'clock before the proprietor made his appearance there, and even when he did so he took little interest in what was going on, but moved restlessly from one room to another, smoking <b>cigar</b> after <b>cigar</b> <b>without</b> intermission, and acknowledging but briefly the greetings of those who were the most regular frequenters of his establishment.|$|R
50|$|Cigar {{etiquette}} is polite behaviour when {{smoking a}} cigar. For example, in 19th century Havana, {{it was considered}} an insult to give another smoker a light from your <b>cigar</b> <b>without</b> first knocking off the ash from the cigar. Another breach of etiquette was to pass on a cigar to a third-party for them to light up too - loaned cigars should instead be returned with a polite flourish.|$|R

6000|$|A {{week ago}} he had invented {{a system of}} leaving his {{cigar-case}} and cigarette-box in an unused drawer {{at the bottom of}} the correspondence-file, in the outer office.

6000|$|It {{was then}} the hour of the afternoon, between the time of luncheon {{and the time of}} dinner, when the {{business}} of a tavern is generally in a state of suspense. The dining-room was empty when Mr. Vimpany entered it: and the waiter's unoccupied attention was in want of an object. Having nothing else to notice, he looked at the person who had just come in. The deluded stranger was drinking fiery potato-brandy, and smoking (at the foreign price) an English cigar. Would his taste tell him the melancholy truth? No: it seemed to matter nothing to him what he was drinking or what he was smoking. Now he looked angry, and now he looked puzzled; and now he took a long letter from his pocket, and read it in places, and marked the places with a pencil. [...] "Up to some mischief," [...] was the waiter's interpretation of these signs. The stranger ordered a second glass of grog, and drank it in gulps, and fell into such deep thought that he let his cigar go out. Evidently, a man in search of an idea. And, to all appearance, he found what he wanted on a sudden. In a hurry he paid his reckoning, and left his small change and his <b>unfinished</b> <b>cigar</b> on the table, and was off before the waiter could say, [...] "Thank you." ...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of fins {{is to reduce}} heat from an object. The experiment is about utilizing the fins for heat dissipation. The method is by using an experimental set-up to observe temperature difference of 6 arrays of rectangular fins and calculate the Nusselt number to understand the convection force of the fins and validate the data with theoretical calculation from the experimental result. Second approaches are by wrapping each of the fins with aluminum coil and compare the result with experimental result <b>without</b> the <b>wrap.</b> Conclusion, {{it is observed that}} the highest value for the Nusselt number is 505. 469 can be achieved by the wrapped fins array than <b>without</b> <b>wrap</b> on fins about 39. 347 which is about 8. 44 % positive increment. Further research can be done through used of custom made fins in shape of aerofoil, which perhaps help in heat dissipation of the fins much better as the air flow is much smoother...|$|R
6000|$|Staniford's shaft had recoiled {{upon his}} own head. [...] "O Lord!" [...] he cried, getting {{up from the}} table, [...] "I can't stand that!" [...] The others {{regarded}} him, as he felt, even to that weasel of a Hicks, as a sheep of uncommon blackness. He went on deck, and smoked a <b>cigar</b> <b>without</b> relief. He still heard the girl's voice in singing; and he still felt in his nerves the quality of latent passion in it which had thrilled him when she sang. His thought ran formlessly upon her future, and upon what sort of being was already fated to waken her to those possibilities of intense suffering and joy which he imagined in her. A wound at his heart, received long before, hurt vaguely; and he felt old.|$|R
50|$|In 1938, {{at the age}} of 14, he went to work at the José L. Piedra Cigar Factory in Guanajay, Pinar del Río Province, {{but later}} moved to Havana, Cuba to begin work at the H.

It was in these factories that he learned to roll the parejo (straight-sided) cigars. He learned to roll more complex and difficult figurados (shaped cigars), such as pyramides at the Josè Gener factory. He was able also to master the technique of rolling <b>cigars</b> <b>without</b> a mold and other techniques as well., He was later the first to offer the complex diadema (a large figurado) to the U.
