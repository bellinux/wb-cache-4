50|$|Some obvious {{irregularities}} {{could be}} found in the Federal Electoral Committee official results. For example, the sum of the numbers of valid and invalid votes was not equal to the number of voters; the sum of the numbers of the voters voting at the polling stations and the voters voting at home exceeded the total number of voters; the sum of the numbers of the used and the <b>unused</b> <b>ballot</b> <b>papers</b> was short by 117,244 in comparison to the number of eligible voters, the number of eligible voters was different from the one announced before the elections and has differed in the presidential, federal and local elections results, etcAll of these discrepancies provoked massive outrage. The results were declared false immediately after Milošević was removed and the new official results were declared shortly afterwards. The new results were practically the same, except for the number of total votes and the votes for Milošević, both of which were lower by 125,000-130,000 votes, thus making Koštunica an absolute first-round election winner.|$|E

50|$|The voter {{marks the}} <b>ballot</b> <b>papers</b> {{in the privacy}} of a voting booth. Polling {{stations}} must provide a writing implement for voters; usually pencils are provided (for practical reasons, as ink pens may dry out or spill), but there is no legal requirement for voters to mark their <b>ballot</b> <b>papers</b> with a pencil (they can use their own pen instead). If the <b>ballot</b> <b>paper</b> has been spoilt, the presiding officer/poll clerk can issue a new one after the old <b>ballot</b> <b>paper</b> is cancelled. Before placing the <b>ballot</b> <b>papers</b> in the <b>ballot</b> box, the voter has (in theory) to show the presiding officer or the poll clerk the official mark and the unique identifying number printed on the reverse of the <b>ballot</b> <b>papers.</b>|$|R

50|$|Turkish Newspaper Cumhuriyet {{claimed that}} the Supreme Electoral Council of Turkey (YSK) had printed 141,654,161 <b>ballot</b> <b>papers</b> despite an {{electorate}} formed of 52,695,831 voters. Some sources, including the YSK itself, put the number of <b>ballot</b> <b>papers</b> printed to between 144 and 151 million. The YSK responded by defending its decision, {{saying that it was}} required by law to send 15% more <b>ballot</b> <b>papers</b> extra to each ballot box. The YSK also re-iterated that more than one <b>ballot</b> <b>paper</b> was required per voter since different ballots were used to elect municipal mayors, muhtars and city councils. Nevertheless, members of the opposition raised concern on how the extra <b>ballot</b> <b>papers</b> would be utilised, with MHP MPs warning that the spare <b>ballot</b> <b>papers</b> would be used by the PKK to increase the votes of the pro-Kurdish BDP in the south-east.|$|R
50|$|The United Kingdom {{secret ballot}} {{arrangements}} are sometimes criticised {{because it is}} possible to link a <b>ballot</b> <b>paper</b> to the voter who cast it. Each <b>ballot</b> <b>paper</b> is individually numbered and each elector also has a number. When an elector is given a <b>ballot</b> <b>paper,</b> their number is noted down on the counterfoil of the <b>ballot</b> <b>paper</b> (which also carries the <b>ballot</b> <b>paper</b> number). This means, of course, that the secrecy of the ballot is not guaranteed, if anyone can gain access to the counterfoils, which are locked away securely before the ballot boxes are opened at the count. Polling station officials colluding with election scrutineers may therefore determine how individual electors have voted.|$|R
50|$|The {{total number}} of <b>ballot</b> <b>papers</b> issued was 21,100. The {{total number of}} <b>ballot</b> <b>papers</b> {{returned}} was 6,825, representing a 32.4% turnout.

The YSK responded to questions regarding its decision by stating that it was required by law to print extra <b>ballot</b> <b>papers.</b> The YSK president Sadi Güven also stated that the uncertainty of how many people would vote at customs gates was also a factor behind the decision to send a disproportionately large number of <b>ballot</b> <b>papers</b> to national borders.

40|$|This audit {{assessed}} the adequacy {{and effectiveness of}} the Australian Electoral Commission’s implementation of a previous recommendation relating to the transport and storage of completed <b>ballot</b> <b>papers.</b> Overall conclusion The integrity of the processes for conducting Federal Elections {{is central to the}} effectiveness of the Australian democracy. The AEC has publicly acknowledged that the loss of 1370 WA Senate <b>ballot</b> <b>papers</b> between the fresh scrutiny and recount for the 7 September 2013 Election disenfranchised the affected voters as well as damaged the organisation’s reputation. Ultimately, the loss of those <b>ballot</b> <b>papers</b> led to the September 2013 Election of six WA Senators being declared void and a new election being held on 5 April 2014, with a different political outcome compared to both the fresh scrutiny count and the recount from the September 2013 Election—and at an estimated additional cost to the Australian Government of some $ 23. 2  million. Each Federal Election is a complex logistical event, {{with a wide range of}} preparation tasks required to be completed before polling day. This includes keeping the electoral roll up to date, the recruitment and training of a large temporary workforce as well as the securing of premises for polling and the subsequent counting of completed <b>ballot</b> <b>papers.</b> It has been noted that, despite modern technology, the AEC’s election operations are labour intensive, and that the system relies heavily upon people and their commitment to the task. The secure transport and storage of completed <b>ballot</b> <b>papers</b> is one important element in the successful delivery of a Federal Election. Issues concerning the physical security of transport and storage arrangements for completed <b>ballot</b> <b>papers</b> were raised with the AEC before the 2007 Federal General Election in a security risk assessment. In addition, one of the nine recommendations in ANAO’s April 2010 audit report included that the AEC identify and assess options to improve physical security over the transport and storage of completed <b>ballot</b> <b>papers,</b> with JSCEM requesting that ANAO’s follow‑up audit activity give priority to that recommendation. A further sign alerting the AEC of the need to improve the transport and storage arrangements for <b>ballot</b> <b>papers</b> was provided during the 2010 General Election. Specifically, House of Representatives <b>ballot</b> <b>papers</b> in one NSW Division went missing after they had been counted on polling night (but the number of missing <b>ballot</b> <b>papers</b> was not large enough to affect the result) and there were two instances related to the transport of election materials by contractors, one of which involved a box of WA Senate <b>ballot</b> <b>papers</b> that had ‘dropped off’ an open utility in transit from the Divisional Office to storage. It took the AEC some time to progress implementation of the ANAO’s recommendation that it identify and assess options that would provide greater physical security over the transport and storage of completed <b>ballot</b> <b>papers.</b> In addition, the AEC adopted a narrow interpretation of the recommendation, which resulted in inadequate action being taken. Specifically, rather than identifying and assessing options to improve the physical security over the transport and storage of completed <b>ballot</b> <b>papers</b> (as had been recommended by ANAO), the AEC focused on making more overt in procedural and training documentation its expectation that polling place officials keep <b>ballot</b> <b>papers</b> secure at all times by implementing existing approaches to <b>ballot</b> <b>paper</b> security. Such an approach alone does not provide sufficient support to the AEC’s large temporary workforce, which plays a crucial role in <b>ballot</b> <b>paper</b> security on polling‑day and in the transport of <b>ballot</b> <b>papers</b> to fresh scrutiny centres. In this context, at a national level, the AEC has not sought to make use of the data available in returns completed by the Officer in Charge (OIC) of each polling place to assess whether the procedures and training in relation to <b>ballot</b> <b>paper</b> security were being effectively applied. Further, the actions recorded by the AEC were focused on polling place officials and did not include other key parts of the life cycle of completed <b>ballot</b> <b>papers.</b> In particular, the actions recorded by the AEC did not address: 	the transport of completed <b>ballot</b> <b>papers</b> by contractors, on polling night and subsequently. In some States and Divisions, contractors have an important role in transporting completed <b>ballot</b> <b>papers</b> but ANAO’s further work in this area identified a range of shortcomings with the approach taken by the AEC to contracting for the transport of completed <b>ballot</b> <b>papers.</b> In particular, inadequate security provisions were a feature in most of the contracts examined; or 	security arrangements at premises used to store <b>ballot</b> <b>papers.</b> Variable practices were observed for the Divisions and polling places examined by the ANAO. Of note was that the extent and nature of security measures employed at offsite scrutiny premises differed, and the lockable rooms available at some of these premises were not large enough to hold all completed <b>ballot</b> <b>papers.</b> The insufficient attention paid to the above matters reflects adversely on the AEC’s governance processes and suggests the need for a stronger organisational emphasis on continuous improvement. The Keelty report commissioned by the AEC in relation to the 1370 missing WA Senate <b>ballot</b> <b>papers</b> from the September 2013 Election made a number of findings, and included various recommendations relating to <b>ballot</b> <b>paper</b> security. In turn, the AEC’s February 2014 submission to JSCEM outlined the actions that are to be taken to address the matters raised by the Keelty report. A number of these actions would have been relevant and appropriate as a management response to the earlier ANAO recommendation that the AEC identify and assess options to improve physical security over the storage and transport of completed <b>ballot</b> <b>papers.</b> In addition, having regard to the findings of this follow‑up audit, ANAO has made a further three recommendations relating to the AEC: 	becoming more aware, at a national level, of the extent to which important procedures are being adhered to, training is being applied and if there are any significant differences in the number of votes counted at the polling place on election‑night and the subsequent Divisional Office fresh scrutinies; 	promoting a consistent, high standard approach to contracting for the transport of <b>ballot</b> <b>papers</b> and other election material. This includes by providing national guidance to State and Divisional Offices on the circumstances where the use of contractors is to be preferred as well as those where AEC employees are considered better placed to perform this work. In addition, there would be benefits from the AEC developing a stronger contracting framework by, among other matters, including appropriate security requirements for <b>ballot</b> <b>papers</b> and other election material in all contracts; and 	improving the security over the storage of completed <b>ballot</b> <b>papers,</b> particularly at offsite scrutiny centres and private residences. More broadly, ANAO performance audits seek to provide a stimulus for improved public sector performance and accountability by making specific recommendations to assist agencies improve upon existing approaches and address risks to the delivery of outcomes. In this context, concerns have been raised over time by the AEC’s audit committee about the time that the organisation takes to action audit recommendations that have been agreed. The AEC’s public apologies and the steps it has outlined that will be taken in response to the Keelty report indicates that the organisation recognises there are lessons to be learned from the experience with the 2013 WA Senate Election. Against this background, and having regard to the earlier signs that should have alerted the AEC to the need to improve the transport and storage arrangements for completed <b>ballot</b> <b>papers,</b> a key message for the AEC from this follow‑up performance audit is that there needed to be stronger ownership of the implementation of agreed ANAO recommendations within the AEC. In this context, it is important that the AEC’s governance arrangements emphasise continuous improvement and provide assurance that the action taken in response to agreed recommendations effectively addresses the matters that lead to recommendations being made, so as to protect the integrity of Australia’s electoral system and rebuild confidence in the AEC. In relation to the secure transport and storage of completed <b>ballot</b> <b>papers,</b> implementation of the three ANAO recommendations made in this report will require a greater focus by the AEC on providing appropriate support to Divisional Offices and the large temporary election workforce, who play key roles in transporting and storing <b>ballot</b> <b>papers</b> as well as contracting for <b>ballot</b> <b>paper</b> transport and storage...|$|R
