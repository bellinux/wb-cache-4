40|$|INTRODUCTION: Liver {{transplantation}} is {{a highly}} effective treatment for end-stage liver disease. However, there is debate over the practice of liver transplantation in older recipients (age ≥ 60 years) given the relative shortage of donor grafts, worse post-transplantation survival, and concern that that older patients may utilize excess resources postoperatively, thus threatening the economic feasibility of the procedure. AIM: To determine if patients ≥ 60 years of age utilize more health resources following liver transplantation compared with younger patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Consecutive adult patients who underwent primary liver transplantation (n = 208) at a single center were studied over a 2. 5 -year period. Data were collected on clinico-demographic characteristics and resource <b>utilization.</b> Descriptive <b>statistics,</b> including means, standard deviations, or frequencies were obtained for baseline variables. Patients were stratified into 2 groups: age ≥ 60 years (n = 51) and 3 ̆c 60 years (n = 157). The Chi-Square Test, Mantel-Haenszel Test, 2 -sample test and odds ratios were calculated to ascertain associations between age and resource utilization parameters. Regression analyses were adjusted for model for end-stage liver disease score, location before surgery, diabetes mellitus, donor age, cold ischemia time, albumin, and diagnosis of hepatitis C. RESULTS: Recipients ≥ 60 years of age have similar lengths of hospitalization, re-operative rates, need for consultative services and readmission rates following liver transplantation, but have longer lengths of stay {{in the intensive care}} (hazard ratio 1. 97, p = 0. 03).

MethodsThis was a retrospective, population-based, statewide study of children with Down syndrome born 1998 - 2007, identified by the Florida Birth Defects Registry (FBDR) and linked to hospital discharge records for 1 - 10 years after birth. To evaluate hospital resource <b>utilization,</b> descriptive <b>statistics</b> on number of hospitalized days and hospital costs were calculated. Results were stratified by isolated Down syndrome (no other coded major birth defect); presence of severe and non-severe CHDs; and presence of major FBDR-eligible birth defects without CHDs. ResultsFor 2, 552 children with Down syndrome, there were 6, 856 inpatient admissions, of which 68. 9 % occurred {{during the first year of}} life (infancy). Of the 2, 552 children, 31. 7 % (n= 808) had isolated Down syndrome, 24. 0 % (n= 612) had severe CHDs, 36. 3 % (n= 927) had non-severe CHDs, and 8. 0 % (n= 205) had a major FBDR-eligible birth defect in the absence of CHD. Infants in all three non-isolated DS groups had significantly higher hospital costs compared to those with isolated Down syndrome. From infancy through age 4, children with severe CHDs had the highest inpatient costs compared to children in the other sub-groups. ConclusionsResults support findings that for children with Down syndrome the presence of other anomalies influences hospital use and costs, and children with severe CHDs have greater hospital resource utilization than children with other CHDs or major birth defects without CHDs.

40|$|Abstract Background Data from {{a statewide}} survey in India and clinic-based studies in {{developed}} settings have previously suggested {{an association between}} maternal physical intimate partner violence (IPV) experiences and the low use of antenatal care (ANC). This study aimed to explore the association between maternal experiences of physical and sexual IPV {{and the use of}} reproductive health care services, using a large nationally representative data set from Bangladesh. Methods This paper used data from the 2007 Bangladesh Demographic Health Survey. The analyses were based on the responses of 2001 currently married women living with at least one child younger than 5 years. Exposure was determined from maternal reports of physical and sexual IPV. The utilization of ANC according to amount and type of provider and utilization of delivery assistance according to provider type were used as proxy outcome variables for reproductive health care <b>utilization.</b> Descriptive <b>statistics</b> and multivariate logistic regression analysis used in the study. Results Approximately two out of four (48. 2 %) respondents had experienced physical IPV. Maternal experience of physical IPV was associated with low use of receiving sufficient ANC (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0. 69; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 49 – 0. 96), lower likelihood of receiving ANC (AOR 0. 69; 95 % CI 0. 53 – 0. 89), and assisted deliveries from skilled provider (AOR 0. 54; 95 % CI 0. 37 – 0. 78). Women who had been sexually abused were significantly less likely to have visited a skilled ANC and delivery care provider. Furthermore, severity of physical IPV appeared to have more profound consequences on the outcome measured. Conclusions The association between exposure to IPV and use of reproductive health care services suggests that partner violence plays a significant role in lower utilization of reproductive health services among women in Bangladesh. Our findings suggest that, in addition {{to a wide range of}} socio-demographic factors, preventing maternal physical and sexual IPV need to be considered as an important psychosocial determinates for the higher utilization of reproductive health care services in Bangladesh. </p...|$|R

Although model-assisted and model-based estimation methods are common in the production of small area <b>statistics,</b> <b>utilization</b> of the underlying model and estimation method are rarely included in the sample area allocation scheme. Therefore, we have developed a new model-based allocation named g 1 -allocation. For comparison, one recently developed model-assisted allocation is presented. These two allocations are based on an adjusted measure of homogeneity which is computed using an auxiliary variable and is an approximation of the intra-class correlation within areas. Five model-free area allocation solutions presented in the past are selected from the literature as reference allocations. Equal and proportional allocations need the number of areas and area-specific numbers of basic statistical units. The Neyman, Bankier and NLP (Non-Linear Programming) allocation need values for the study variable concerning area level parameters such as standard deviation, coefficient of variation or totals. In general, allocation methods can be classified according to the optimization criteria and use of auxiliary data. Statistical properties of the various methods are assessed through sample simulation experiments using real population register data. It can be concluded from simulation results that inclusion of the model and estimation method into the allocation method improves estimation results...|$|R
40|$|Today’s {{processors}} {{provide a}} rich source of statistical information on application execution through hardware counters. In this paper, we explore the <b>utilization</b> of these <b>statistics</b> as request signatures in server applications for identifying requests and inferring highlevel request properties (e. g., CPU and I/O resource needs). Our key finding is that effective request signatures may be constructed using a small amount of hardware statistics while the request is still in an early stage of its execution. Such on-the-fly request identification and property inference allow guided operating system adaptation at request granularity (e. g., resource-aware request scheduling and on-the-fly request classification). We address the challenges of selecting hardware counter metrics for signature construction and providing necessary operating system support for per-request statistics management. Our implementation in the Linux 2. 6. 10 kernel suggests that our approach requires low overhead suitable for runtime deployment. Our on-the-fly request resource consumption inference (averaging 7 %, 3 %, 20 %, and 41 % prediction errors for four server workloads, TPC-C, TPC-H, J 2 EE-based RUBiS, and a trace-driven index search, respectively) is much more accurate than the online running-average based prediction (73 – 82 % errors). Its use for resource-aware request scheduling results in a 15 – 70 % response time reduction for three CPU-bound applications. Its use for on-the-fly request classification and anomaly detection exhibits high accuracy for the TPC-H workload with synthetically generated anomalous requests following a typical SQL-injection attack pattern...|$|R

This study compares the two existing cloud mask products available for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), stored in the quality layer of the MOD 09 daily surface reflectance product. For both masks, statistics on cloud occurrence are calculated for 1 year of daily surface reflectance data covering the area of southeast Asia. Furthermore, a cloud mask enhancement algorithm is presented for increasing cloud flag reliability by effectively combining the existing cloud labels together with the <b>utilization</b> of annual <b>statistics</b> based on the blue reflectance band. Furthermore, since a lot of compositing algorithms rely on cloud mask information for the filtering of unsuitable observations, the influence of the different cloud masks on 8 -day MOD 09 A 1 composite outputs is examined with respect to data availability and average view angles. The results of the statistical analysis show that the accuracy of the two cloud mask products differs significantly for southeast Asia. Particularly, the radiative influence of land cover proves to strongly affect the reliability of the cloud flags, although to varying degrees throughout the year. The enhancement algorithm successfully identifies undetected clear observations in the original masks while simultaneously setting upper limits for atmospheric contamination. In this manner, considerably higher proportions of cloud-free observations can be retained compared to a clear-sky conservative combination of the masks as applied in other compositing algorithms...|$|R
