40|$|This study {{describes}} an accurate, sensitive, and specific chromatographic method for the simultaneous quantitative determination of lamivudine and zidovudine in human blood plasma, using stavudine as an internal standard. The chromatographic separation was performed using a C 8 column (150 x 4. 6 mm, 5 mu m), and <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>absorbency</b> detection at 270 nm with gradient elution. Two mobile phases were used. Phase A contained 10 mM potassium phosphate and 3 % acetonitrile, whereas Phase B contained methanol. A linear gradient was {{used with a}} variability of A-B phase proportion from 98 - 2 % to 72 - 28 %, respectively. The drug extraction was performed with two 4 mL aliquots of ethyl acetate.

40|$|The present {{invention}} is a rapid {{method of}} determining the concentration of the major components in a chemical stream. The present invention is also a simple, low cost, device {{of determining the}} in-situ concentration of the major components in a chemical stream. In particular, the present invention provides a useful method for simultaneously determining the concentrations of sodium hydroxide, sodium sulfide and sodium carbonate in aqueous kraft pulping liquors through use of an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) tunnel flow cell or optical probe capable of producing a <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>absorbency</b> spectrum over a wavelength of 190 to 300 nm. In addition, the present invention {{eliminates the need for}} manual sampling and dilution previously required to generate analyzable samples. The inventive method can be used in Kraft pulping operations to control white liquor causticizing efficiency, sulfate reduction efficiency in green liquor, oxidation efficiency for oxidized white liquor and the active and effective alkali charge to kraft pulping operations.

40|$|Abstract: The {{relation}} between total colloid potential {{energy and the}} surface energy of nanopowder in organic solvent was given by the DLVO theory and EDLVO theory, which mainly considered that total colloid potential energy consisted of Vander Waals energy, electrostatic energy and interfacial polarity interaction energy. Three kinds of nanopowder (TiO 2, SiO 2 and ZnO) and seven organic solvents (glycol, dimethyl sulfoxide, formamide, methanol, n-hexane, cyclohexane, and acetone) were used in our experiments. Their surface energies in seven organic solvents were measured respectively. Total colloid potential energy of each nanopowder was obtained by computer program. The dispersion behavior of nanopowder in organic liquids was checked up by two experiments: one of experiments was the sedimentation of TiO 2, SiO 2 and ZnO in glycol, dimethyl sulfoxide, formamide, methanol, n-hexane, cyclohexane, and acetone; another of experiments was the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>absorbency</b> of TiO 2 powders treated by plasma in different conditions in glycol. Experimental results showed that there was high cor{{relation between}} the maximum colloid potential energy and the dispersion behavior of the nanopowder in organic solvent. So the dispersion behavior of the nanopowder in organic solvent can be evaluated by the maximum colloid potential energy...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial biofilms are {{ubiquitous}} {{in nature and}} industrial settings. In this study, a biofilm consortium was enriched in a continuous-flow-cell system using humic acid as the sole carbon and energy source. The degradation of the humic acids by the consortium under two supplementary carbon sources was investigated by <b>ultraviolet</b> (UV) <b>absorbency,</b> Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and electrospray mass spectrometry (ES-MS). The morphological characteristics of the biofilm consortium and the isolated cultures from the biofilm were observed under an epifluorescence microscope. The metabolic diversity of the selected cultures from the degradative consortium, based on substrate usage pattern, was examined using Biolog EcoPlates. Microscopic analysis revealed that the biofilm was formed by various morphotypes of bacteria, fungi, and yeasts, as well as amoebas. The substrate usage profiles of the bacteria confirmed that, in addition to yeasts and fungi, two groups of bacterial consortia were developed in the biofilm to degrade the humic acids. The degradation of humic acid in the biofilm was mostly carried out in a secondary or a cometabolic path. Addition of the readily digestible external carbon source enhanced {{the growth of the}} biofilm consortium. The FTIR and ES-MS spectra confirmed the changes in chemical structure of the humic acid by the biofilm community. Articl...|$|R
40|$|Mobilization of {{dissolved}} {{organic carbon}} (DOC) and related trace elements (TEs) from the frozen peat to surface waters in the permafrost zone is expected to enhance under ongoing permafrost thaw and active layer thickness (ALT) deepening in high-latitude regions. The interstitial soil solutions are efficient tracers of ongoing bio-geochemical processes in the critical zone and can help to decipher the intensity of carbon and metals migration from the soil to the rivers and further to the ocean. To this end, we collected, across a 640  km latitudinal transect of the sporadic to continuous permafrost zone of western Siberia peatlands, soil porewaters from 30  cm depth using suction cups and we analyzed DOC, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and 40  major elements and TEs in 0. 45  µm filtered fraction of 80  soil porewaters. Despite an expected decrease in the intensity of DOC and TE mobilization from the soil and vegetation litter to the interstitial fluids {{with the increase in}} the permafrost coverage and a decrease in the annual temperature and ALT, the DOC and many major and trace elements did not exhibit any distinct decrease in concentration along the latitudinal transect from 62. 2 to 67. 4 ° N. The DOC demonstrated a maximum of concentration at 66 ° N, on the border of the discontinuous/continuous permafrost zone, whereas the DOC concentration in peat soil solutions from the continuous permafrost zone was equal to or higher than that in the sporadic/discontinuous permafrost zone. Moreover, a number of major (Ca, Mg) and trace (Al, Ti, Sr, Ga, rare earth elements (REEs), Zr, Hf, Th) elements exhibited an increasing, not decreasing, northward concentration trend. We hypothesize that the effects of temperature and thickness of the ALT are of secondary importance relative to the leaching capacity of peat, which is in turn controlled by the water saturation of the peat core. The water residence time in peat pores also plays a role in enriching the fluids in some elements: the DOC, V, Cu, Pb, REEs, and Th were a factor of 1. 5 to 2. 0 higher in mounds relative to hollows. As such, {{it is possible that the}} time of reaction between the peat and downward infiltrating waters essentially controls the degree of peat porewater enrichments in DOC and other solutes. A 2 ° northward shift in the position of the permafrost boundaries may bring about a factor of 1. 3  ±  0. 2 decrease in Ca, Mg, Sr, Al, Fe, Ti, Mn, Ni, Co, V, Zr, Hf, Th, and REE porewater concentration in continuous and discontinuous permafrost zones, and a possible decrease in DOC, specific <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>absorbency</b> (SUVA), Ca, Mg, Fe, and Sr will not exceed 20...|$|E
