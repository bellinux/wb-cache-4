We tested and statistically analyzed DNA concentration, UVC dose, sample volume, radiation time, the number of correctly detected alleles on genetic loci, {{and the number of}} correctly detected alleles in four groups in which 16 loci were divided. Results When working surfaces were not decontaminated and were treated only with <b>UVC</b> <b>radiation</b> in the laboratory, the genetic profile for naked DNA could not be obtained after 2 minutes of <b>UVC</b> <b>radiation</b> and for saliva after 54 hours.

Modifications on surface morphology, induced by radiation, were observed by atomic force microscopy. The polyurethane derivate from castor oil shows good resistance to gamma radiation, with only {{small changes in}} hardness, elastic modulus, viscoelastic properties and contact angle. The hardness of PU increases at the near surface region due to UVA radiation and decreases after <b>UVC</b> <b>radiation.</b> The contact angle for water drop decreases after <b>UVC</b> <b>radiation,</b> but not after gamma radiation, despite {{a significant increase in}} roughness. Such results are attributed to different responses from polyurethane to radiation energy. Increase in hardness due to UVA is attributed to a higher crosslinking at shallow depths, while a decrease in mechanical properties may be attributed to chain scission. These results are consistent with the modifications on viscoelastic properties. Shore D hardness did not show the same trend as observed by nanoindentation results.

40|$|To {{become a}} cancer cell, a cell must {{inactivate}} apoptosis {{in order to}} avoid dying. This model predicts that cancer cells are more resistant to DNA damaging agents because they have deactivated the apoptotic pathway. Apoptotic signal caused by <b>UVC</b> <b>radiation</b> triggers intrinsic or mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Other apoptotic pathway is coupled directly to FADD (Fas-associating protein with death domain), an adaptor protein essential for mediating apoptosis (extrinsic or death receptor pathway). UVC could trigger this extrinsic pathway. Our initial effort was to develop dose-response relationships for survival and apoptosis as a function of <b>UVC</b> <b>radiation</b> using embryonic fibroblasts derived from FADD knockout mice and their genetic counterparts. We examined the effects of UVC exposure on the survival of FADD positive (FADD+/+) and FADD negative (FADD-/-) cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. FADD+/+ and FADD-/- cells were irradiated with UVC light (254 nm) using a germicidal lamp. The culture media was drained before the irradiation and fresh media was added after. The UVC doses in our study were 50 J/m 2, 75 J/m 2 and 300 J/m 2. The cell proteins were isolated 24 and 48 hours after each UVC exposure. The poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), 113 kDa nuclear enzyme, is the first protein cleaved in fragments of 89 and 24 kDa during apoptosis and this event was analysed by Western blotting using antibodies specific for PARP. The results indicated that FADD-/- cells irradiated with a dose of 50 J/m 2 do not undergo apoptosis after 24 hours which was not case with FADD+/+ cells. FADD+/+ cells irradiated with 50 J/m 2, 75 J/m 2 and 300 J/m 2 UVC doses undergo apoptosis after 24 hours as well as after 48 hours.

We examined the effects of a sublethal dose of UVC on FRTL- 5 cell growth and gene expression. Cells exposed to 10 J/m(2) UVC showed no differences in viability compared to control cells after 24 h, but the BrdU incorporation was reduced, indicating a cytostatic effect. Quantitative RT-PCR carried out at 24 and 48 h after irradiation demonstrated that the mRNA levels of thyroglobulin (Tg), thyroperoxidase (Tpo), and sodium/iodide symporter (Nis) were transiently decreased at 24 h in treated cells, while the mRNAs of the thyroid transcription factors TTF 1, Foxe 1, and Pax 8 were not affected. In cells cultured with TSH-free medium, the basal transcription of Tg, Tpo, and Nis genes was equally impaired by radiation and no longer stimulated by TSH. Overall, the results demonstrate that a sub-apoptotic dose of UVC compromises not only thyrocyte proliferation but also the expression of genes involved in thyroid hormone production. These findings might contribute to explaining the histological, biochemical, and clinical features of hypothyroidism observed in both animals and humans during spaceflight, and suggest that free thyroxine levels of astronauts during prolonged space missions should be monitored...|$|R

Hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) and nonafluoro(iso) butyl ether (HFE) and co-deposited HMDS/HFE plasma films were modified by ultraviolet (<b>UVC)</b> or beta <b>radiation</b> exposure (electron beam, 2 MeV, from 10 nA to 100 nA). Silicon, acrylics and piezoelectric quartz crystal (PQC) were used as substrates. Film characterization used profilemeter for thickness and ellipsometer for refractive index determinations; Raman, infrared (FTIR) and x-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectroscopies determined chemical composition. Optical, scanning electron (SEM) and atomic force (AFM) microscopies evaluated the film resistance toward ultraviolet light or beta radiation and cluster formation; cluster size were estimated using ImageJ software. Contact angle measurements tested hydrophobicity and the adsorption of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Simulations of detector surfaces (based on PQC detection) and respective package used FEMLAB 3. 2 software. All films are hydrophobic and adsorbent, even after exposition to ultraviolet radiation. HMDS films exposed to ultraviolet form a silicone-like structure whereas beta radiation exposure leads to carbon nodules formation. HFE films act as passive layer, even for beta radiation.

These hot spots are shown to arise predominantly at sites of mutations involving multiple base changes, a class of mutations which arises more frequently at the longer solar wavelength. Lastly, we observed that most of the sites at which mutational hot spots arise after both UVC and UVB irradiation of the shuttle vector are also sites at which mutations arise spontaneously. Thus, a common mechanism may be involved in determining the site specificity of mutations, in which the DNA structure may be a more important determinant than the positions of DNA photoproducts...|$|R

Factors such as particle size, and possible association of viruses with suspended EBW particulate, were not investigated in this study, but {{may have contributed to}} the difference in UVC effectiveness. Future work should emphasize improved filtration methods prior to UV treatment of processing plant EBW at an industrial scale. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Low-level lasers {{are used}} at low power densities and doses {{according}} to clinical protocols supplied with laser devices or based on professional practice. Although {{use of these}} lasers is increasing in many countries, the molecular mechanisms involved in effects of low-level lasers, mainly on DNA, are controversial. In this study, we evaluated the effects of low-level red lasers on survival, filamentation, and morphology of Escherichia coli cells that were exposed to ultraviolet C (<b>UVC)</b> <b>radiation.</b> Exponential and stationary wild-type and uvrA-deficient E. coli cells were exposed to a low-level red laser and in sequence to <b>UVC</b> <b>radiation.</b> Bacterial survival was evaluated to determine the laser protection factor (ratio {{between the number of}} viable cells after exposure to the red laser and UVC and the number of viable cells after exposure to UVC). Bacterial filaments were counted to obtain the percentage of filamentation. Area-perimeter ratios were calculated for evaluation of cellular morphology. Experiments were carried out in duplicate and the results are reported as the means of three independent assays. Pre-exposure to a red laser protected wild-type and uvrA-deficient E. coli cells against the lethal effect of <b>UVC</b> <b>radiation,</b> and increased the percentage of filamentation and the area-perimeter ratio, depending on UVC fluence and physiological conditions in the cells. Therapeutic, low-level red laser radiation can induce DNA lesions at a sub-lethal level. Consequences to cells and tissues should be considered when clinical protocols based on this laser are carried out...|$|E
40|$|Tardigrades inhabiting {{terrestrial}} environments exhibit extraordinary {{resistance to}} ionizing radiation and UV radiation although {{little is known}} about the mechanisms underlying the resistance. We found that the terrestrial tardigrade Ramazzottius varieornatus is able to tolerate massive doses of UVC irradiation by both being protected from forming UVC-induced thymine dimers in DNA in a desiccated, anhydrobiotic state as well as repairing the dimers that do form in the hydrated animals. In R. varieornatus accumulation of thymine dimers in DNA induced by irradiation with 2. 5 kJ/m 2 of <b>UVC</b> <b>radiation</b> disappeared 18 h after the exposure when the animals were exposed to fluorescent light but not in the dark. Much higher UV radiation tolerance was observed in desiccated anhydrobiotic R. varieornatus compared to hydrated specimens of this species. On the other hand, the freshwater tardigrade species Hypsibius dujardini that was used as control, showed much weaker tolerance to <b>UVC</b> <b>radiation</b> than R. varieornatus, and it did not contain a putative phrA gene sequence...|$|E
40|$|This work aims at the production, {{characterization}} {{and use of}} adsorbent plasma {{thin films}} in miniaturized structures. The films were designed to perform as passive mixers or adsorptive layers in sensors. Clustered films from tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and nonafluoro(iso) butyl ether (HFE®) precursors on silicon, acrylic and glass substrates were prepared in an in-built plasma reactor. Profilometry and ellipsometry measurements were performed to determine thickness and refractive indexes. The chemical composition {{and the presence of}} carbon nodules were inferred from infrared (FTIR), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman microscopy data. Chemical characterization points out a silicone like structure, sensible to the presence of humidity as determined by CV analysis, and a fluorinated surface that protects against ultraviolet <b>radiation</b> (<b>UVC).</b> The film resistance to base/acid solutions was verified in an optical microscope. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed cluster formation in the film. Microscopic images were analyzed using ImageJ® software in order to determine cluster size and density. Contact angle measurements evaluated the hydrophobic/hydrophilic film character for volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These films present hydrophobic and organophilic characteristics; however, exposure to UVC leads to hydrophilic surfaces. The performance of miniaturized structures was simulated with FEMLAB ® 3. 2 software and then they were built and tested. Using a mechanical mask, 3 D-microchannels were modified and used as passive mixers and/or spray formation. Thus, the results point out the utility of these films in humidity sensors or as passive layers for mixing. Key words: adsorbent films, plasma thin films, passive mixers, humidity presence, passive layers...|$|R
40|$|XP 14 BR is a {{cell line}} {{derived from a}} {{xeroderma}} pigmentosum (XP) patient from complementation group C. The patient was unusual in presenting with an angiosarcoma of the scalp, treated by surgical excision and radiotherapy. Following 38 Gy in 19 fractions with 6 MEV electrons, a severe desquamation and necrosis of the underlying bone ensued, and death followed 4 years later. The cell line was correspondingly hypersensitive to the lethal effects of gamma irradiation. We had previously shown that this sensitivity could be discriminated from that seen in ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). The cellular response to ultraviolet radiation below 280 nm (UVC) was characteristic of XP cells, indicating the second instance, in our experience, of dual cellular <b>UVC</b> and ionizing <b>radiation</b> hypersensitivity in XP. We then set out to evaluate any defects in repair of ionizing radiation damage and to verify any direct contribution of the XPC gene. The cells were defective in repair of a fraction of double strand breaks, with a pattern reminiscent of A-T. The cell line was immortalized with the vector pSV 3 neo and the XPC cDNA transfected in to correct the defect. The progeny derived from this transfection showed {{the presence of the}} XPC gene product, as measured by immunoblotting. A considerable restoration of normal UVC, but not ionizing radiation, sensitivity was observed amongst the clones. This differential correction of cellular sensitivity is strong evidence for the presence of a defective radiosensitivity gene, distinct from XPC, which is responsible for the clinical hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation. It is important to resolve how widespread ionizing radiation sensitivity is amongst XP patients...|$|R
40|$|Solar {{radiation}} sustains and affects {{all life}} forms on Earth. The increase in solar UV-radiation at environmental levels, due to {{depletion of the}} stratospheric ozone layer, highlights serious issues of social concern. This becomes still more dramatic in tropical and subtropical regions where radiation-intensity is still higher. Thus, there {{is the need to}} evaluate the harmful effects of solar UV-radiation on the DNA molecule as a basis for assessing the risks involved for human health, biological productivity and ecosystems. In order to evaluate the profile of DNA damage induced by this form of radiation and its genotoxic effects, plasmid DNA samples were exposed to artificial-UV lamps and directly to sunlight. The induction of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photoproducts (CPDs) and oxidative DNA damage in these molecules were evaluated by means of specific DNA repair enzymes. On the other hand, the biological effects of such lesions were determined through the analysis of the DNA inactivation rate and mutation frequency, after replication of the damaged pCMUT vector in an Escherichia coli MBL 50 strain. The results indicated the induction of a significant number of CPDs after exposure to increasing doses of <b>UVC,</b> UVB, UVA <b>radiation</b> and sunlight. Interestingly, these photoproducts are those lesions that better correlate with plasmid inactivation as well as mutagenesis, and the oxidative DNA damages induced present very low correlation with these effects. The results indicated that DNA photoproducts play the main role in the induction of genotoxic effects by artificial UV-radiation sources and sunlight. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.
