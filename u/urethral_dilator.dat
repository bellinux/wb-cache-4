40|$|A 60 -year-old man was {{presented}} to an orthopedi-cian in the operating theatre as a case of difficult urinary catheterization. The patient was going for a lengthy orthopedic operation that required a drained urinary bladder beforehand. The urologist was called and he found the patient anesthetized, having circumcised penis and a pin-hole external urethral meatus (EUM) at the corona penis level. The tight meatus was negotiated first with a lu-bricated 4 -french (Fr) bougie <b>urethral</b> <b>dilator</b> fol-lowed by subsequent sized dilators up to 14 - Fr caliber when a proper Foley catheter was intro-duced easily into the bladder. Post-operatively, the catheter was removed. The patient was carefully interviewed to reveal that circumcision was per...|$|E
30|$|Open surgery procedures: an {{inverted}} Y-shaped incision in the perineum {{was made to}} dissociate the cavernous body of urethra to the stenotic segment. A flexible cystoscope was inserted through the bladder stoma, and a <b>urethral</b> <b>dilator</b> was inserted into the internal orifice of the normal urethra and advanced to the blind end of the proximal normal urethra {{with the assistance of}} the flexible cystoscope. The blind end of the normal urethra was incised from the perineal incision and the surrounding scar tissue was removed till the mucosa of the normal urethra was exposed. End-to-end anastomosis for the distal and proximal end of the urethra was conducted, and an F 18 Forley catheter was placed.|$|E
30|$|Endoscopic minimally-invasive procedures: an {{inflexible}} cystoscope {{was inserted}} from the bladder stoma. A <b>urethral</b> <b>dilator</b> was placed into the internal orifice {{of the normal}} urethra and advanced to the blind end of the proximal normal urethra {{with the assistance of}} the cystoscope. Then, a urethral resectoscope was inserted from the external urethral orifice to the narrow segment of the urethra, and located at the blind-end of the normal urethra under the guidance of the dilator in the proximal urethra. The blind-end of the normal urethra was incised with an internal-urethrotomy scalpel, and surrounding scars were removed with a resectoscope in case they were severe. False passage was excluded, zebra urological guide wire was placed into the normal urethra, and a F 18 Forley catheter was inserted along the guide wire.|$|E

30|$|Intracavity minimally-invasive {{operation}} {{should be}} used {{with the presence of}} false passage and the distance being < 1 Â cm, between the blind end of the proximal normal urethra and the distal urethra (i.e. length of stenotic passage), which has been confirmed by pre-operative urethrography and flexible cystoscopy. During the operation, a flexible cystoscope was inserted from the suprapubic bladder stoma, to find out the internal orifice of the urethra; and then, {{with the assistance of the}} cystoscope, a <b>urethral</b> <b>dilator</b> was placed at the internal orifice of the normal urethra and entered into the normal posterior urethra to prop up the blind end of the normal urethra; an internal-incision-scope was inserted from the external urethral orifice, to incise the blind end with cold-scalpel till the internal-incision-scope was able to enter into the bladder smoothly; the false passage was excluded; a zebra urological guide wire was inserted into the normal urethra, and a F 18 Forley catheter was placed along the wire.|$|E
