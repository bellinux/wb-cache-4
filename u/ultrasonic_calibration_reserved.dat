40|$|In {{the context}} of multivariate mean {{regression}} we propose a new method to measure and estimate the inadequacy of a given parametric model. The measure is basically the missed fraction of variation after adjusting the best possible parametric model from a given family.

The estimation method is based on local polynomial averaging of residuals with a polynomial degree that increases with the dimension d of the covariate. For any d ≥ 1 and under some weak assumptions we give a Bahadurtype representation of the estimator from which √n-consistency and asymptotic normality are derived for strongly mixing variables.

MObjects are visualized by transfer functions based on the probability of each voxel {{of belonging to the}} MObject (1 and 2). The MObject cut-through (C) shows areas with high probability (H) in the center. Medium (M) and low (L) probabilities represent the uncertainty cloud (U) showing outliers {{of individual}} objects. Abstract—This paper describes an advanced visualization method for the analysis of defects in industrial 3 D X-Ray Computed Tomography (XCT) data. We present a novel way to explore a high number of individual objects in a dataset, e. g., pores, inclusions, particles, fibers, and cracks demonstrated on the special application area of pore extraction in carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP). After calculating the individual object properties volume, dimensions and shape factors, all objects are clustered into a mean object (MObject). The resulting MObject parameter space can be explored interactively. To do so, we introduce the visualization of mean object sets (MObject Sets) in a radial and a parallel arrangement. Each MObject may be split up into sub-classes by selecting a specific property, e. g., volume or shape factor, and the desired number of classes. Applying this interactive selection iteratively leads to the intended classifications and visualizations of MObjects along the selected analysis path. Hereby the given different scaling factors of the MObjects down the analysis path are visualized through a visual linking approach. Furthermore the representative MObjects are exported as volumetric datasets to serve as input for successive calculations and simulations. In the field of porosity determination in CFRP non-destructive testing practitioners use representative MObjects to improve <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>calibration</b> curves. Representative pores also serve as input for heat conduction simulations in active thermography. For a fast overview of the por...|$|R

AUGUR 5. 4 {{is a new}} generation of calibration systems developed since 1991. The system allows measuring or calculating most part of contact and immersion probes parameters which described in European Standard EN 12688 - 2. Main system feature is based on use of scanning device with two axes and single hemispherical test block (for contact probes) and small ball-type reflectors (for immersion probes).

30|$|This study {{examined}} the feasibility of near infrared spectroscopy as a novel technique for log assessment {{on the basis of}} wood property. Near infrared (NIR) spectra were obtained from the transverse section of green log and multivariate regression analysis was carried out to predict the stiffness of veneer processed from the log. The stiffness of the veneer was dynamic modulus of elasticity measured using <b>ultrasonic</b> method. The <b>calibrations</b> of veneer stiffness had moderate relationships between measured and NIR-predicted values, with regression coefficients ranging from 0.84 to 0.88. The calibration equations were applied to the test set and it was found that predictions were also well fitted, with regression coefficients ranging from 0.67 to 0.89. The results indicate that the variation of wood stiffness within the logs could be assessed using the NIR spectra from the cross-section of logs. The spectra were obtained from green condition of the log and the stiffness of veneer was measured after kiln drying. Thus, the results imply that the wood stiffness in dry condition could be predicted using the spectra collected from green logs. If the models obtained in this study put into the imaging system, the two-dimensional map of the stiffness would be visualized on the cross-section of logs. The NIR spectroscopy coupled with imaging system could compensate the weak point of the traditional methods for log assessment.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a model for}} the {{measuring}} process of sonic anemometers (ultrasound pulse based) is presented. The differential equations that describe the travel of ultrasound pulses are solved in the general case of non-steady, non-uniform atmospheric flow field. The concepts of instantaneous line-average and travelling pulse-referenced average are established and employed to explain and calculate the differences between the measured turbulent speed (travelling pulse-referenced average) and the line-averaged one. The limit k 1 l= 1 established by Kaimal in 1968, as the maximum value which permits the neglect of the influence of the sonic measuring process on the measurement of turbulent components is reviewed here. Three particular measurement cases are analysed: A non-steady, uniform flow speed field, a steady, non-uniform flow speed field and finally an atmospheric flow speed field. In the first case, for a harmonic time-dependent flow field, Mach number, M (flow speed to sound speed ratio) and time delay between pulses have revealed themselves to be important parameters in the behaviour of sonic anemometers, within the range of operation. The second case demonstrates how the spatial non-uniformity of the flow speed field leads to an influence of the finite transit time of the pulses (M≠ 0) {{even in the absence of}} non-steady behaviour of the wind speed. In the last case, a model of the influence of the sonic anemometer processes on the measurement of wind speed spectral characteristics is presented. The new solution is compared to the line-averaging models existing in the literature. Mach number and time delay significantly distort the measurement in the normal operational range. Classical line averaging solutions are recovered when Mach number and time delay between pulses go to zero in the new proposed model. The results obtained from the mathematical model have been applied to the calculation of errors in different configurations of practical interest, such as an anemometer located on a meteorological mast and the transfer function of a sensor in an atmospheric wind. The expressions obtained can be also applied to determine the quality requirements of the flow in a wind tunnel used for <b>ultrasonic</b> anemometer <b>calibrations...</b>|$|R

In medicine, ultrasound imaging techniques non-invasively obtain information about size {{and structure of the}} tissues, and functions of the organs of the body. The research presented in this dissertation involves two important aspects of the <b>ultrasonic</b> imaging, system <b>calibration</b> for quality assurance and tissue characterization. The first part presents the design of tissue-mimicking material for ultrasonic experiments and system calibration. The second part presents results on ultrasonic tissue characterization applied to quality grading of beef;Calibration of ultrasonic system with tissue-mimicking materials is an important part in quality assurance. Also, such materials aid researchers in developing new techniques for imaging and tissue characterization. A part of this research, presented {{in the first part of}} the dissertation, was to develop soft-tissue mimicking materials. A method of constructing gelatin based soft-tissue mimicking materials with desired ultrasonic properties was developed. Several materials in different proportions were tried in preliminary experiments for their usefulness as tissue mimicking phantoms. An optimum combination was then derived for the ultrasonic properties (velocity, attenuation and backscatter) in the ranges for the soft-tissues;Ultrasonic tissue characterization involves determination of propagation characteristics of ultrasonic energy in the tissues. In recent years, many ultrasonic parameters, including velocity, attenuation, and scattering, have been found to have potential for tissue characterization. Advanced signal processing and pattern recognition techniques are applied to extract information about particular parameters. As a part of a project on ultrasonic meat quality grading at Iowa State University, several tissue samples were scanned and data were analyzed. Some encouraging results are presented in the second part of the dissertation. This report describes efforts in ultrasonic evaluation of fat marbling in the rib-eye muscle of beef carcass. The development of a regression model for prediction of %fat is discussed. Also, a statistical pattern recognition approach used for classifying the grades of marbling is presented. A simple but accurate classification scheme using linear discriminant analysis has been derived for assigning the marbling grades to the rib-eye samples. This scheme employed easily calculated parameters from the spectrum of the backscattered ultrasonic signal. In the meat industry, this could be applied to differentiate (and ultimately, to grade) meat samples with varying contents and distribution of fat and muscle tissues. A similar approach could be applied for non-invasive characterization and differentiation of infiltrative diseases of organs...|$|R
