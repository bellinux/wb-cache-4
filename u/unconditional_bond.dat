40|$|In {{construction}} contracts, a 'performance bond' is a bond {{taken out}} by the contractor, usually with a bank or insurance company (in return for payment of a premium), {{for the benefit of}} and {{at the request of the}} employer, in a stipulated maximum sum of liability and enforceable by the employer in the event of the contractor's default, repudiation or insolvency, as stated by Nigel M Robinson et. al. in his book, Construction Law in Singapore and Malaysia. He further added that there are two types of performance bonds: Conditional bond or default bond; and <b>Unconditional</b> <b>bond</b> or on-demand bond. However, in Malaysia, for the past 20 years and since the famous case of Teknik Cekap Sdn Bhd v Public Bank Berhad [1995] 3 MLJ 449 to the recent Suharta Development Sdn Bhd v United Overseas Bank (M) Bhd & Anor [2005] 2 MLJ 762, the question of whether the performance bond in a construction contract is a conditional or an unconditional guarantees is still one of the issues relating to performance bond that has been discussed. Therefore, the objective of this research is to determine the phrase(s) in the Performance Bond in a construction contract that determine whether the performance bond is a conditional or unconditional on demand guarantee. In order to achieve this objective, the research was conducted by analyzing relevant court cases. From the findings, it can be concluded that unless an undisputed meaning of the words in the performance bond to make the performance bond to be purely conditional or unconditional 'on-demand' bond, most court interpreted performance bond to be an on-demand performance bond which is only conditional upon the beneficiary asserting the basis of the claim upon the issuer of the bond contending that there has been breach of contract. ...|$|E
40|$|Performance bond {{is one of}} the {{important}} provisions in construction contracts. The provision requires the contractor to give the employer security for the due performance of the contract. There are two types of performance bond. The first type is called conditional bond. It is a contract guarantee whereby the surety becomes liable upon proof of breach of the terms of the main contract by principal and the beneficiary sustaining loss as a result of such a breach. The second type is unconditional or ‘ondemand’ performance bond. It is a covenant whereby the surety becomes liable merely when a demand is made upon him by the beneficiary with no necessity for the beneficiary to prove any default by the principal in performance of the main contract. The main distinction between the two types of bond is with respect to the requirement for making call on the bond. In conditional performance bond, the beneficiary must comply with conditions precedent for calling the bond. In <b>unconditional</b> <b>bond,</b> the only condition precedent is a written notice to the surety. However, the contractor may apply for injunction against the employer to restrain the employer from calling the bond or receiving any payment under the performance bond. When considering the application for injunction, the courts have to determine the presence of fraud or unconscionable conduct by the employer. In most court cases, unconscionability had been interpreted as unfairness. In determining unconscionability, the court will use the test of ‘balance of convenience’ and ‘seriously arguable and realistic inference test’. However, whether there is unconscionability depends on the facts of each case. There is no predetermined categorization. The court has to assess the whole facts of the cases to determine unconscionability. From the court cases, it can be concluded that there are two circumstances that amount to unconscionable conduct. Firstly, breach of contract by the contractor that is induced by employer’s own default such as late payment and secondly, force majeure such as typhoon and flood...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{decision}} of Austin J in Boral Formwork v Action Makers highlights significant statutory inroads into the autonomy principle, {{as it applies}} to bank guarantees and <b>unconditional</b> performance <b>bonds.</b> To explore whether these instruments should continue to be accepted in lieu of cash retentions, this paper examines the autonomy principle and its exceptions (both common law and statutory). The conclusion reached is that the uncertain, and potentially broadening, operation of both the common law and statutory exceptions to the autonomy principle may significantly curtail the use of bank guarantees and <b>unconditional</b> performance <b>bonds</b> as cash equivalents. For a bank guarantee or <b>unconditional</b> performance <b>bond</b> to function as a risk allocation device (as well as a security), an intended beneficiary will need to routinely implement certain safeguards. Placing blind faith in the autonomy principle will no longer suffice...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, the {{homeland}} concept has received an ever-increasing amount of attention by cultural geographers. While the debate surrounding the necessity and applicability of the concept continues, {{it is more than}} apparent that no other geographic term (including culture areas or culture regions) captures the essence of peoples’ attachment to place better than homeland. The literature, however, provides few examples of the deep-seated loyalty people have for a homeland despite being physically detached from that space. Employing land use mapping and informal interviews, this paper seeks to help fill that gap by exemplifying how the daily lives of Mormons living in Chihuahua, Mexico reflect their connection to the United States and the Mormon Homeland. Our research revealed that, among other things, the Anglo residents perpetuate their cultural identity through their unique self-reference, exhibit territoriality links reflected in their built environment, and demonstrate <b>unconditional</b> <b>bonding</b> to their homeland through certain holiday celebrations. It is clear to us, as the Anglo-Mormon experience illustrates, that the homeland concept deserves a place within the geographic lexicon...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the benefits from}} currency hedging, both for speculative and risk minimization motives, in international bond and equity portfolios. The risk-return performances of globally diversified portfolios are compared with and without forward contracts. Over the period 1974 to 1990, inclusion of forward contracts results in statistically significant improvements {{in the performance of}} <b>unconditional</b> portfolios containing <b>bonds.</b> Conditional strategies are also implemented, both in sample and out of sample, and are shown to both significantly improve the risk-return tradeoff of global portfolios and to outperform unconditional hedging strategies.

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} U. S. investors' international portfolios over a 25 -year period. Portfolio returns are formed by first estimating monthly bilateral holdings in 44 countries using high-quality but infrequent benchmark surveys that enable us to eliminate the geographical bias in reported capital flows data. In their foreign equity portfolios, U. S. investors achieved a significantly higher Sharpe ratio than global benchmarks, especially since 1990. We uncover three potential reasons for this success. First, they abstained from returns-chasing behavior and instead sold past winners. Second, conditional performance tests provide {{no evidence that the}} superior (unconditional) performance owed to private information, suggesting that the successful exploitation of publicly available information played a role. Third, well-documented preferences for cross-listed and well-governed foreign firms appear to have served U. S. investors well. We also {{evaluate the}} <b>unconditional</b> performance of <b>bond</b> portfolios, about which less information is available, and find that U. S. investors achieved higher Sharpe ratios than global benchmarks, although the difference here is not statistically significant. Investments, Foreign...|$|R
40|$|Quality {{problems}} that are known to the seller of a product, but will become known to the buyer only after the purchase {{have the potential to}} frustrate voluntary exchanges. Where the determination of quality after the sale is cut-and-dried, brand names and <b>unconditional</b> guarantees will <b>bond</b> contract performance. When the problem is more subtle or confounded by the extent of consumer inputs, requiring risk-sharing by the contracting parties, these bonding devices typically are not sufficient. Under the circumstances, seller financing may be an efficient contracting solution for bonding the quality dimension of the contract. This form of financing makes both the buyer and the seller share the risk that the product may not suit the buyer’s needs in the way promised by the seller. This paper provides further empirical evidence on the quality assurance role of seller financing. We consider seller-financed second mortgages in the National Association of Realtors database. Seller financing in second mortgages may be a supplement to first mortgages supplied by conventional lenders. The role of seller financing as a quality assurance mechanism in second mortgages is more complex than its role in first mortgages, but is also less subject to an alternative interpretation of credit rationing than is its role in seller-financed first mortgages. To avoid further complexities, we do not consider second seller financing transactions that supplement first assumption mortgage transactions. Dogan Tirtiroglu and David N. Laban...|$|R
40|$|The {{responsible}} {{management of}} the rehabilitation and decommissioning of mine sites and the affected environs requires an effective regulatory, policy, and financial securities framework in place. While mining jurisdictions may {{have confidence in the}} adequacy of their policy and regulatory systems, financial security mechanisms (posted by mining companies in the form of <b>unconditional</b> performance <b>bonds)</b> are often also used to minimise negative mining-related outcomes. In theory, such mining securities ensure sufficient funds are available to a government to rehabilitate mine sites in the event operators fail to meet their mine rehabilitation and closure obligations. However, four major challenges are often encountered with these mechanisms: 1) They are commonly insufficient to cover appropriate mine closure activities and environmental remediation {{in the case of a}} default; 2) Bonds are tied to individual tenements and not damages outside of the designated zone; 3) Mining companies bear significant administrative costs associated with the creation and posting of bonds, and; 4) They do not solve the problem of historical abandoned mine sites. Conventional environmental bond mechanisms also create disincentives to mining company investment (particularly small companies) and little financial benefit for governments (benefits are largely captured by the banking sector). While Western Australia has long been considered as a sophisticated and advanced mining intensive jurisdiction, as of 2011 the state environmental bond system was estimated to cover less than 25 % of the total obligation of mine site rehabilitation costs that may be required. These concerns led to the creation of an innovative policy approach: the Mining Rehabilitation Fund Act 2012. This paper discusses the background to the significant inefficiencies in the previous arrangements (which remain typical across the developed world), how they expose governments and mining companies to significant environmental obligations and financial challenges, and how they disincentivise mining activity. The paper also summarises how the Mining Rehabilitation Fund (MRF) anticipates and underwrites the full closure costs for mine rehabilitation, how it is a cost-neutral source of funds for governments to remediate existing abandoned mines, and how it ‘frees up’ mining company capital. It is estimated that after only ten years the MRF will cover the full clean-up cost of even the largest mine in Western Australia should any complete default occur as a worst case scenario. The interest earned by the government on the principal MRF funds will also be available for rehabilitation and remediation of previously abandoned mines, additional environmental monitoring, and impact assessment and remediation research and development. The paper concludes with how such a system may be adaptable to the African context...|$|R
