He rose and partly unzipped his jacket where the revolver was concealed, and plotted his [...] "pattern of fire" [...] for shooting them. He asked Canty what he had said, and he repeated his statement. At this Goetz <b>unzipping</b> his jacket the rest of the way, drew the gun, and shot Canty, hitting him {{in the center of the}} body. He then turned to shoot Allen who had tried to flee, hitting him in the back, and then shot Ramseur, wounding him in the chest and arm. He then shot again, at Cabey, but may have missed. According to Goetz he then approached Cabey and shot him on the ground; however another witness disputed that Goetz shot Cabey a second time.|$|E

2500|$|A more {{realistic}} way of modeling {{the behavior of}} nucleic acids {{would seem to be}} to have parameters that depend on the neighboring groups on both sides of a nucleotide, giving a table with entries like [...] "TCG/AGC". However, this would involve around 32 groups for Watson-Crick pairing and even more for sequences containing mismatches; the number of DNA melting experiments needed to get reliable data for so many groups would be inconveniently high. However, other means exist to access thermodynamic parameters of nucleic acids: [...] microarray technology allows hybridization monitoring of tens of thousands sequences in parallel. This data, in combination with molecular adsorption theory allows the determination of many thermodynamic parameters in a single experiment and to go beyond the nearest neighbor model. In general the predictions from the nearest neighbor method agree reasonably well with experimental results, but some unexpected outlying sequences, calling for further insights, do exist. Finally, we should also mention the increased accuracy provided by single molecule <b>unzipping</b> assays which provide a wealth of new insight into the thermodynamics of DNA hybridization and the validity of the nearest-neighbour model as well.|$|E

50|$|Boron nitride nanosheets {{may also}} be {{synthesized}} by the <b>unzipping</b> of boron nitride nanotubes (BNNT). These nanotubes can be made into sheets by breaking the bonds connecting the N and B atoms by potassium intercalation or by etching by plasma or an inert gas. The <b>unzipping</b> of boron nitride nanotubes by plasma {{can be used to}} control the size of the nanosheets, but it produces semiconducting boron nitride nanosheets. The potassium intercalation method produces a low yield of nanosheets as boron nitride is resistive to the effects of intercalants.|$|E
5000|$|Recent {{findings}} have characterized the pathology of RYR2 mutations {{and how they}} relate to SOICR {{as a matter of}} the intrinsic properties of the ryanodine channel. Two theories propose the underlying mechanism, domain <b>unzipping</b> and FKBP12.6 unbinding. Firstly, domain <b>unzipping</b> refers to the separation of the N-terminal domain's interaction with the central domain; destabilizing the receptor. The mutation would compromise the stability of the Ryr2's closed state and increase its sensitivity to stimuli like luminal and cytosolic calcium. Domain <b>unzipping</b> coincides with the specific Ryr2 domain mutations associated with CPTV [...] The second theory of FKBP12.6 is more controversial [...] FKBP12.6 is a RYR2 binding protein that stabilizes the receptor. FKBP12.6 binding to RYR2 is regulated by RYR2 phosphorylation via PKA that results in the dissociation of FKBP12.6, rendering Ryr2 more sensitive to cytosolic calcium activation [...] However, as mentioned above, evidence has been conflicted in determining FKBP12.6's role in CPTV. So far the literature concludes that FKBP12.6 {{may play a role in}} certain CPTV mutations but not others, further research needs to clarify this protein's role.|$|E
