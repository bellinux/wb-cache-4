After Mandela and Fischer were sentenced in the mid-1960s, Gordimer {{considered}} going into exile, but she changed her mind and later recalled [...] "I wouldn't be accepted as I was here, even in the worst times and even though I'm white". Just as Rosa struggles to find her place as a white in the anti-apartheid liberation movement, so did Gordimer. In an interview in 1980, she said that [...] "when we have got beyond the apartheid situation—there's a tremendous problem for whites, unless whites are allowed in by blacks, and <b>unless</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> make out a case for our being accepted and we can forge a common culture together, whites are going to be marginal".|$|E

For very large systems, finding such an aggregation is often the only way to perform a meaningful analysis of such systems. Since aggregation is important, researchers have been trying to find a general efficient algorithm for detecting aggregability. In this paper, we show that in general, detecting aggregability is NP-hard even for linear systems, and thus (<b>unless</b> P=NP), <b>we</b> <b>can</b> only hope to find efficient detection algorithms for specific classes of systems.

The reviewer, too, objects to Bates's illustration of [...] "transition forms between Heliconius Melpomene and H. Thelxiope, which he thinks are no more different than [...] "a couple of Dorking hens". Bates's assumption that all forest animals are adapted to forest life is rejected by the reviewer, who sees the same features as signs of a beneficent Creator; while his mention of [...] "slow adaptation of the fauna of a forest-clad country throughout an immense lapse of geological time" [...] is criticised for being [...] "haunted" [...] by this [...] "spectre of time". However the reviewer is fascinated by the variety of life described in the book, and by Bates's [...] "rapturous manner" [...] of speaking about how delicious monkey flesh is, which [...] "almost puts a premium on cannibalism". The review concludes [...] "not without regret" [...] (at such an enjoyable book), and assures readers [...] "that they will not find him heavy reading"; supposes that 11 years was [...] "perhaps a little too much" [...] of tropical life; and recommends intending museum curators to try it for [...] "a year or two".|$|E
