5|$|Alpine plants <b>usually</b> {{occur in}} {{communities}} spaced between barren talus slopes. Cushion-shaped Diapensia lapponica <b>usually</b> grows in {{communities in the}} windiest areas, and in less exposed sites sedge, heath, snowbank, and alpine bog communities can be found.|$|E
5|$|An attack often {{begins with}} muscle pain, cramping, and stiffness. This is {{followed}} by weakness or paralysis that tends to develop rapidly, <b>usually</b> in late evening or {{the early hours of}} the morning. The weakness is <b>usually</b> symmetrical; the limb muscles closer to the trunk (proximal) are predominantly affected, and weakness tends to start in the legs and spread to the arms. Muscles of the mouth and throat, eyes, and breathing are <b>usually</b> not affected, but occasionally weakness of the respiratory muscles can cause life-threatening respiratory failure. Attacks typically resolve within several hours to several days, even in the absence of treatment. On neurological examination during an attack, flaccid weakness of the limbs is noted; reflexes are <b>usually</b> diminished, but the sensory system is unaffected. Mental status is not affected.|$|E
5|$|At {{physiological}} pHs, {{acetic acid}} is <b>usually</b> fully ionised to acetate.|$|E
5|$|Attendees {{under the}} age of {{majority}} are commonly allowed to attend with a notarized parental permission slip or accompanied by an adult. Eurofurence is one exception, only admitting those above 18. Underage attendees are <b>usually</b> given a distinctive badge to allow staff and dealers to restrict access to mature content. Government-issued photo ID is <b>usually</b> required.|$|E
5|$|Balls {{are major}} events held by colleges; the largest, held triennially in 9th week of Trinity Term, are called Commemoration balls; {{the dress code}} is <b>usually</b> white tie. Many other colleges hold smaller events during the year that they call summer balls or parties. These are <b>usually</b> held on an annual or {{irregular}} basis, and are <b>usually</b> black tie.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{potential}} is <b>usually</b> defined as partial molar Gibbs free energy.|$|E
5|$|Cold fronts may feature narrow {{bands of}} {{thunderstorms}} and severe weather, and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines. Warm fronts are <b>usually</b> preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog. The weather <b>usually</b> clears quickly after a front's passage. Some fronts produce no precipitation and little cloudiness, {{although there is}} invariably a wind shift.|$|E
5|$|Dragonfly nymphs are <b>usually</b> a well-camouflaged {{blend of}} dull brown, green, and grey.|$|E
5|$|Ed O'Ross as Itchy: Caprice's other hitman. He is <b>usually</b> {{paired with}} Flattop.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{can also}} irreversibly {{inactivate}} enzymes, <b>usually</b> by covalently modifying active site residues. These reactions, {{which may be}} called suicide substrates, follow exponential decay functions and are <b>usually</b> saturable. Below saturation, they follow first order kinetics with respect to inhibitor.|$|E
5|$|Feeding is <b>usually</b> {{in small}} groups and the bird takes mainly insects. Breeding <b>usually</b> starts in March, with the birds {{building}} their nest high in an acacia tree. The birds <b>usually</b> lay five to six cream eggs with lilac blotches. The nest itself is globular in shape with a tubular entrance on top. It is possible that {{more than just the}} breeding pair visit the nest and that the young of previous years help in rearing the young.|$|E
5|$|Furry {{conventions}} are <b>usually</b> run and {{staffed by}} volunteers, though venues may require certain activities to be contracted out. Event funding typically relies on convention registrations. Many {{of the larger}} conventions are incorporated as non-profit organizations, <b>usually</b> to achieve tax-exempt status and safeguard the organizers' personal assets - in the US, some are 501(c)(3) charities, while others are registered as recreational clubs. The largest events may require up to a hundred volunteers, not including gofers. Volunteers are thanked for their participation during the closing ceremonies, which are <b>usually</b> well-attended, and often receive T-shirts or other benefits.|$|E
5|$|Gamma decay: {{this process}} {{results from a}} change in the energy level of the nucleus to a lower state, {{resulting}} in the emission of electromagnetic radiation. The excited state of a nucleus which results in gamma emission <b>usually</b> occurs following the emission of an alpha or a beta particle. Thus, gamma decay <b>usually</b> follows alpha or beta decay.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{performances}} can {{be classified}} as either formal ones or informal. During formal performances adherents follow a traditional set of rules that would govern playing and it <b>usually</b> involved people from outside the home. Informal performances are quite the opposite. The strict rules that normally govern play are often ignored and the performers are <b>usually</b> between people well acquainted with one another, <b>usually</b> close family members. These performances <b>usually</b> were times when amateurs practiced on the instruments, young boys and girls gathered the instruments, substituting the kulintang with the saronay and inubab. Ensembles didn’t necessary have to have five instruments like formal performances: they could be composed of only four instruments (three gandingan gongs, a kulintang, an agung, and a dabakan), three instruments (a kulintang, a dabakan, and either an agung or three gandingan gongs) or simply just one instrument (kulintang solo).|$|E
5|$|Humidity {{levels are}} <b>usually</b> very high all year round. Manila has a {{distinct}} dry season from December through May, and a relatively lengthy wet season that covers the remaining period with slightly cooler temperatures. In the wet season, it rarely rains all day, but rainfall is very heavy during short periods. Typhoons <b>usually</b> occur from June to September.|$|E
5|$|Hypopituitarism is <b>usually</b> permanent. It {{requires}} lifelong {{treatment with}} one or more medicines.|$|E
5|$|If LEMS {{is caused}} by an {{underlying}} cancer, treatment of the cancer <b>usually</b> leads to resolution of the symptoms. Treatment <b>usually</b> consists of chemotherapy, with radiation therapy in those with limited disease.|$|E
5|$|In copula clauses {{the order}} is <b>usually</b> Subject-Copula-Complement.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, {{travelling}} through unmapped areas, {{men took}} {{up to six}} weeks just to reach their destinations. They often had to carry all their supplies, arms and their radio, often {{with the help of}} Papuan carriers. Teams of two or three spotters typically maintained the stations, each led by an acting non-commissioned-officer (NCO), working in isolation from friendly forces in remote locations for extended periods of time. The teams survived on limited rations, <b>usually</b> supplemented by native food sources. Once their initial supplies were expended they <b>usually</b> had to fend for themselves, although stations were also sometimes re-supplied by airdrop or by sea, but <b>usually</b> only {{in the event of a}} failure of mission essential equipment, or when petrol for the radios ran low. Spotting stations were <b>usually</b> only lightly armed, being <b>usually</b> equipped with just one Owen Gun with 600 rounds for the NCO in charge, and a rifle with only 50 rounds for each other man.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle Ages, {{the devil}} was <b>usually</b> shown as either red, black or green. Dragons were <b>usually</b> green, {{because they had}} the heads, claws and tails of reptiles.|$|E
5|$|Jiutai (地謡) is the chorus, <b>usually</b> {{comprising}} six {{to eight}} people.|$|E
5|$|Jonquils <b>usually</b> have dark green, round, rush-like leaves.|$|E
5|$|Kōken (後見) are stage hands, <b>usually</b> one {{to three}} people.|$|E
5|$|LEMS <b>usually</b> {{occurs in}} people over 40 years of age, but may occur at any age. The {{diagnosis}} is <b>usually</b> confirmed with electromyography and blood tests; these also {{distinguish it from}} myasthenia gravis, a related autoimmune neuromuscular disease.|$|E
5|$|Metabolism is <b>usually</b> {{divided into}} two categories: catabolism, the {{breaking}} down of organic matter for example, the breaking down of glucose to pyruvate, by cellular respiration, and anabolism, the building up of components of cells such as proteins and nucleic acids. <b>Usually,</b> breaking down releases energy and building up consumes energy.|$|E
5|$|Methods of {{propagation}} {{include both}} sexual and asexual reproduction. Commercial cultivars are <b>usually</b> sterile.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scientific}} {{analyses of}} the name must account for {{the origins of the}} different forms found in early sources Latin (<b>usually</b> Londinium), Old English (<b>usually</b> Lunden), and Welsh (<b>usually</b> Llundein), with reference to the known developments over time of sounds in those different languages. It is agreed that the name came into these languages from British Celtic; recent work tends to reconstruct the lost Celtic form of the name as * or something similar. This was adapted into Latin as Londinium and borrowed into West Germanic, the ancestor-language of English, already before English had become widely spoken in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Mycetophila blanda (Mycetophilidae): The Mycetophilidae cultivates <b>usually</b> in milk caps of {{the section}} Deliciosi.|$|E
5|$|Niandra LaDes and <b>Usually</b> Just a T-Shirt {{combines}} avant-garde and stream-of-consciousness styles, with guitar, {{piano and}} various effects on a four-track recorder. The album's first half, Niandra Lades, was recorded before Frusciante left the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1992; during {{the recording of}} Blood Sugar Sex Magik. The second half, <b>Usually</b> Just a T-Shirt, was recorded while the band was on tour {{in the months leading}} up to Frusciante's departure. Niandra Lades and <b>Usually</b> Just a T-Shirt sold poorly upon its release in 1994, and was taken off the market, only to be re-released in 1999.|$|E
5|$|OPV is <b>usually</b> {{provided}} in vials containing 10–20 doses of vaccine. A single dose of {{oral polio vaccine}} (<b>usually</b> two drops) contains 1,000,000 infectious units of Sabin 1 (effective against PV1), 100,000 infectious units of the Sabin 2 strain, and 600,000 infectious units of Sabin 3. The vaccine contains small traces of antibiotics—neomycin and streptomycin—but does not contain preservatives.|$|E
5|$|Onset differs between {{individual}} neuroacanthocytosis syndromes but is <b>usually</b> between ages 20 and 40. Affected individuals <b>usually</b> live for 10–20 years after onset.|$|E
5|$|Other vocalisations {{of wolves}} are <b>usually</b> {{divided into three}} categories: growls, barks and whines. Barking has a {{fundamental}} frequency between 320–904Hz, and is <b>usually</b> emitted by startled wolves. Wolves do not bark as loudly or continuously as dogs do, but bark {{a few times and}} retreat from perceived danger. Growling has a fundamental frequency of 380–450Hz, and is <b>usually</b> emitted during food challenges. Pups commonly growl when playing. One variation of the howl is accompanied by a high pitched whine, which precedes a lunging attack. Whining is associated with situations of anxiety, curiosity, inquiry and intimacy such as greeting, feeding pups and playing.|$|E
5|$|Otis Harlan as Happy: Happy is the joyous dwarf and is <b>usually</b> portrayed laughing.|$|E
5|$|Portias' venom {{is unusually}} {{powerful}} against spiders. When a Portia stabs a small to medium spider (up to the Portia′s weight), including another Portia, the prey <b>usually</b> runs away for about 100 to 200millimetres, enters convulsions, becomes paralysed after 10 to 30seconds, and continues convulsing for 10seconds to 4minutes. Portia slowly approaches the prey and takes it. Portia <b>usually</b> needs to inflict up to 15stabbings to completely immobilise a larger spider(1.5 to 2times to the Portia′s weight), and then Portia may wait about 20 to 200millimetres away for 15 to 30minutes from seizing the prey. Insects are <b>usually</b> not immobilised so quickly but continue to struggle, sometimes for several minutes. If Portia cannot make further contact, {{all types of}} prey <b>usually</b> recover, making sluggish movements several minutes after the stabbing but often starting normal movement only after an hour.|$|E
5|$|Pulpitis is {{classified}} as reversible when the pain is mild to moderate and lasts {{for a short time}} after a stimulus (for instance, cold or sweet); or irreversible when the pain is severe, spontaneous, and lasts a long time after a stimulus. Left untreated, pulpitis may become irreversible, then progress to pulp necrosis (death of the pulp) and apical periodontitis. Abscesses <b>usually</b> cause throbbing pain. The apical abscess <b>usually</b> occurs after pulp necrosis, the pericoronal abscess is <b>usually</b> associated with acute pericoronitis of a lower wisdom tooth, and periodontal abscesses <b>usually</b> represent a complication of chronic periodontitis (gum disease). Much less commonly, non-dental conditions can cause toothache, such as maxillary sinusitis, which can cause pain in the upper back teeth, or angina pectoris, which can cause pain in the lower teeth.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes may prey on {{domestic}} rabbits and guinea pigs {{if they are}} kept in open runs or are allowed to range freely in gardens. This problem is <b>usually</b> averted by housing them in robust hutches and runs. Urban foxes frequently encounter cats and may feed alongside them. In physical confrontations, the cats <b>usually</b> have the upper hand. Authenticated cases of foxes killing cats <b>usually</b> involve kittens. Although most foxes do not prey on cats, some may do so, and may treat them more as competitors rather than food.|$|E
