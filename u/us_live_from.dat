40|$|The {{basis of}} this paper is that we have prioritised the city centre and its {{planning}} sometimes to the impoverishment of the “suburbs” or outlying areas, despite {{the fact that most of}} <b>us</b> <b>live</b> there. Away <b>from</b> the headline projects at the city’s core with its appropriation of architecture to the experience economy and the interests of tourism and retail, there is evidence of creativity and innovation in outlying neighbourhoods, estates and suburbs. Using an expanded range of references from urbanism to service design, cultural studies and environmental writing, Glasgow is taken as a case in point because its large-scale post-industrial regeneration through the use of architecture to brand cultural festivals and centres, is perceived to have overshadowed interesting projects at the periphery. A number of case-studies from different suburban contexts are deployed to illuminate key developments, especially in relation to co-design and changes in consumption and to offer exemplars. These are used to indicate the need for more suburban studies – for Suburbanomics...|$|R

'You get better here or you go to a nut house,' I heard him routinely tell school-aged children[...] [...] [...] [...] Once, after a boy returned from a visit home, Bettelheim spent five minutes slapping him in the face, hitting him in the sides with fists and pulling his hair. Midway through, he revealed why: The lad had told his brother to 'do well in school.' He had no right to 'push' his brother around. To be sure, the blows he struck, though often painful and humiliating, did not physically damage people. But I often saw Bettleheim drag children across the floor by their hair and kick them. He even hit autistic children who couldn't speak clearly." ...|$|R

This relates back to the Protestant work ethic, which ties an individual's value {{to his or her}} ability to work — something that diminishes in old age. Anthropologist Jared Diamond, who has studied the treatment of the elderly across cultures, has said the geriatric in countries like the U.K. and <b>U.S.</b> <b>live</b> [...] "lonely <b>lives</b> separated <b>from</b> their children and lifelong friends."

5000|$|In addition, Hegel does {{believe we}} can know the {{structure}} of God's mind, or ultimate reality. Hegel agrees with Kierkegaard that both reality and humans are incomplete, inasmuch as we are in time, and reality develops through time. But the relation between time and eternity is outside time {{and this is the}} [...] "logical structure" [...] that Hegel thinks we can know. Kierkegaard disputes this assertion, because it eliminates the clear distinction between ontology and epistemology. Existence and thought are not identical and one cannot possibly think existence. Thought is always a form of abstraction, and thus not only is pure existence impossible to think, but all forms in existence are unthinkable; thought depends on language, which merely abstracts from experience, thus separating <b>us</b> <b>from</b> <b>lived</b> experience and the living essence of all beings. In addition, because we are finite beings, we cannot possibly know or understand anything that is universal or infinite such as God, so we cannot know God exists, since that which transcends time simultaneously transcends human understanding.|$|R
