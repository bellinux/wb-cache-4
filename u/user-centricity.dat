40|$|The {{emergent}} {{notion of}} ubiquitous computing {{makes it possible}} for mobile devices to communicate and provide services via networks connected in an ad-hoc manner. These have resulted in the proliferation of wireless technologies such as Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANets), which offer attractive solutions for services that need flexible setup as well as dynamic and low cost wireless connectivity. However, the growing trend outlined above also raises serious concerns over Identity Management (IM) due to a dramatic increase in identity theft. The problem is even greater in service-oriented architectures, where partial identities are sprinkled across many services and users have no control over such identities. In this thesis, we review some issues of contextual computing, its implications and usage within pervasive environments. To tackle the above problems, it is essential to allow users to have control over their own identities in MANet environments. So far, the development of such identity control remains a significant challenge for the research community. The main focus of this thesis is on the area of identity management in MANets and emergency situations by using context-awareness and <b>user-centricity</b> together with its security issues and implications. Context- awareness allows us to make use of partial identities as a way of user identity protection and node identification. <b>User-centricity</b> is aimed at putting users in control of their partial identities, policies and rules for privacy protection. These principles help us to propose an innovative, easy-to-use identity management framework for MANets. The framework makes the flow of partial identities explicit; gives users control over such identities based on their respective situations and contexts, and creates a balance between convenience and privacy. The thesis presents our proposed framework, its development and lab results/evaluations, and outlines possible future work to improve the framework.

Therefore, this article proposes a semantic enhanced converged service exposure model that enables services derived from different domains (i. e., telecom/web/device/user) to be integrated into a composite service regardless of their underlying heterogeneities. Meanwhile, the user-centric feature is enhanced by applying the semantic annotation to both the service description and the user request, as well as empowering a user to publish and share his/her created service in a user-friendly way. Moreover, a variety of interfaces, including APIs, widgets, and natural-language-based tools, are provided to satisfy the multilevel user requirements, enabling users to profit from a highly personalized, meaningful communication and interaction experience...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{trends in}} the area of {{identity}} management have evolved from a traditional identification solution to a distributed user-centric identity management mechanism. The major goal of user-centric identity management is to enable the users to have control over their own digital identities. Even though existing identity management systems attempt to offer <b>user-centricity</b> where users possess complete control on their identity disclosure, however, it does not signify the consequences of the users ’ behavior. It is necessary to assist the users on the risk involved in disclosing their identity attributes. In this paper, we propose a risk-aware mechanism to help the users decide the degree of identity disclosure risk using ontology-based evaluation and privacy preference evaluation. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on dynamic online social networks where the user’s identity plays a major role for access control and privacy management. I...|$|E

The User Layer empowers the end-users to influence network performance based on their interaction activities with the networks. We adopt the Model Human Processor (MHP) approach for building the User Model. After that we present an exemplary User Layer implementation to illustrate how the User Layer interacts with the underlying protocol stack and improves end-user’s satisfaction with network performance.
