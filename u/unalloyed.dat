5|$|Similar alloys {{with the}} {{addition}} of a small amount of lead can be cold-rolled into sheets. An alloy of 96% zinc and 4% aluminium is used to make stamping dies for low production run applications for which ferrous metal dies would be too expensive. For building facades, roofing, and other applications for sheet metal formed by deep drawing, roll forming, or bending, zinc alloys with titanium and copper are used. <b>Unalloyed</b> zinc is too brittle for these manufacturing processes.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of these many allotropes makes machining plutonium very difficult, as it changes state very readily. For example, the α form exists at room temperature in <b>unalloyed</b> plutonium. It has machining characteristics similar to cast iron but changes to the plastic and malleable β (beta) form at slightly higher temperatures. The reasons for the complicated phase diagram are not entirely understood. The α form has a low-symmetry monoclinic structure, hence its brittleness, strength, compressibility, and poor thermal conductivity.|$|E
5|$|About fifty {{grades of}} {{titanium}} and titanium alloys are designed and currently used, although {{only a couple}} of dozen are readily available commercially. The ASTM International recognizes 31 grades of titanium metal and alloys, of which Grades 1 through 4 are commercially pure (<b>unalloyed).</b> Those four vary in tensile strength as a function of oxygen content, with Grade 1 being the most ductile (lowest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.18%), and Grade 4 the least ductile (highest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.40%). The remaining grades are alloys, each designed for specific properties of ductility, strength, hardness, electrical resistivity, creep resistance, specific corrosion resistance, and combinations thereof.|$|E
5|$|The {{two most}} useful {{properties}} of the metal are corrosion resistance and strength-to-density ratio, the highest of any metallic element. In its <b>unalloyed</b> condition, titanium is as strong as some steels, but less dense. There are two allotropic forms and five naturally occurring isotopes of this element, 46Ti through 50Ti, with 48Ti being the most abundant (73.8%). Although {{they have the same}} number of valence electrons and are in the same group in the periodic table, titanium and zirconium differ in many chemical and physical properties.|$|E
5|$|In November 2011, Kaye {{announced}} that particles of pure (<b>unalloyed)</b> titanium {{had also been}} found on the tie. He explained that titanium, which was much rarer in the 1970s than it is today, {{was at that time}} found only in metal fabrication or production facilities, or at chemical companies using it (combined with aluminum) to store extremely corrosive substances. The findings suggested that Cooper may have been a chemist or a metallurgist, or possibly an engineer or manager (the only employees who wore ties in such facilities at that time) in a metal or chemical manufacturing plant, or at a company that recovered scrap metal from those types of factories. In January 2017, Kaye reported that rare earth minerals such as cerium and strontium sulfide had also been identified among particles from the tie. One of the rare applications for such elements in the 1970s was Boeing's supersonic transport development project, suggesting the possibility that Cooper was a Boeing employee. Other possible sources of the material included plants that manufactured cathode ray tubes, such as the Portland firms Teledyne and Tektronix.|$|E

25|$|In chapter 1 of his work, Evans proposes for {{the first}} time a {{transitional}} Copper Age between the Neolithic and the Bronze Age. He adduces evidence from far-flung places such as China and the Americas to show that the smelting of copper universally preceded alloying with tin to make bronze. He does not know how to classify this fourth age. On the one hand he distinguishes it from the Bronze Age. On the other hand, he includes it:In thus speaking of a bronze-using period I by no means wish to exclude the possible use of copper <b>unalloyed</b> with tin.|$|E

He once said that cricket had given him more <b>unalloyed</b> pleasure over a longer period than anything else, and that pleasure was evident in his writing. Thomson saw cricket not only as the most pleasurable of pastimes but also quite like the Poet Laureate might see it—an eternally vibrant display of colour, spirit, humour and conflict.|$|E
25|$|At {{the outset}} India's {{relations}} with Bangladesh {{could not have}} been stronger because of India's <b>unalloyed</b> support for independence and opposition against Pakistan in 1971. During the independence war, many refugees fled to India. When the struggle of resistance matured in November 1971, India also intervened militarily and may have helped bring international attention to the issue through Indira Gandhi's visit to Washington, D.C. Afterwards India furnished relief and reconstruction aid. India extended recognition to Bangladesh prior {{to the end of the}} war in 1971 (the second country to do so after Bhutan) and subsequently lobbied others to follow suit. India also withdrew its military from the land of Bangladesh when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman requested Indira Gandhi to do so during the latter's visit to Dhaka in 1972.|$|E
25|$|Heat {{exchangers}} using {{copper and}} its alloys have evolved along with heat transfer technologies {{over the past}} several hundred years. Copper condenser tubes were first used in 1769 for steam engines. Initially, the tubes were made of <b>unalloyed</b> copper. By 1870, Muntz metal, a 60% Cu-40% Zn brass alloy, was used for condensers in seawater cooling. Admiralty metal, a 70% Cu-30% Zn yellow brass alloy with 1% tin added to improve corrosion resistance, was introduced in 1890 for seawater service. By the 1920s, a 70% Cu-30% Ni alloy was developed for naval condensers. Soon afterwards, a 2% manganese and 2% iron copper alloy was introduced for better erosion resistance. A 90% Cu-10% Ni alloy first became available in the 1950s, initially for seawater piping. This alloy is now the most widely used copper-nickel alloy in marine heat exchangers.|$|E

A thin layer of chromium is deposited on pretreated metallic surfaces by electroplating techniques. There are two deposition methods: Thin, below 1µm thickness, layers are deposited by chrome plating, and are used for decorative surfaces. If wear-resistant surfaces are needed then thicker chromium layers are deposited. Both methods normally use acidic chromate or dichromate solutions. To prevent the energy-consuming change in oxidation state, the use of chromium(III) sulfate is under development, but for most applications, the established process is used.|$|E

After his Fourth and Fifth Symphonies failed to gain general public approval, Mahler {{was convinced that}} his Sixth would finally succeed. However, its reception was dominated by satirical comments on Mahler's unconventional percussion effects—the use of a wooden mallet, birch rods and a huge square bass drum. Viennese critic Heinrich Reinhardt dismissed the symphony as [...] "Brass, lots of brass, incredibly much brass! Even more brass, nothing but brass!" [...] The one <b>unalloyed</b> performance triumph within Mahler's lifetime was the premiere of the Eighth Symphony in Munich, on 12 September 1910, advertised by its promoters as the [...] "Symphony of a Thousand."

500|$|Upon Eraserhead release, Variety {{offered a}} {{negative}} review, calling it [...] "a sickening bad-taste exercise". The review expressed incredulity over the film's long gestation and described its finale as unwatchable. Comparing Eraserhead to Lynch's next film The Elephant Man, Tom Buckley of The New York Times felt {{that while the}} latter was a well-made film with an accomplished cast, the former was not. Buckley called Eraserhead [...] "murkily pretentious", and felt that the film's horror aspects stemmed solely from {{the appearance of the}} deformed child rather than from its script or performances. Writing in 1984, Lloyd Rose of The Atlantic felt that Eraserhead demonstrated that Lynch was [...] "one of the most <b>unalloyed</b> surrealists ever to work in the movies". Rose described the film as being intensely personal, finding that unlike previous surrealist films, such as Luis Buñuel's 1929 work Un Chien Andalou or 1930's L'Age d'Or, Lynch's imagery [...] "isn't reaching out to us from his films; we're sinking into them". In a 1993 review for the Chicago Tribune, Michael Wilmington described Eraserhead as unique, feeling that the film's [...] "intensity" [...] and [...] "nightmare clarity" [...] were a result of Lynch's attention to detail in its creation due to his involvement in so many roles during its production. In the 1995 essay Bad Ideas: The Art and Politics of Twin Peaks, critic Jonathan Rosenbaum felt that Eraserhead represented Lynch's best work. Rosenbaum felt that the director's artistic talent declined as his popularity grew, and contrasted the film with Wild at Heart—Lynch's most recent feature film at that time—saying [...] "even the most cursory comparison of Eraserhead with Wild at Heart reveals an artistic decline so precipitous {{that it is hard to}} imagine the same person making both films".|$|E
