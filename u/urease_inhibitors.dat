The experiment was carried out in a laboratory with samples of a Brazilian Oxisol containing 790 g kg- 1 clay and 23 g kg- 1 organic matter. Treatments consisted of addition of poultry litter (PL), organic mineral fertilizer (OMF) and urea to the soil, with and without the <b>urease</b> <b>inhibitor</b> N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT), plus a control with no fertilizer. We applied the fertilizers over the soil surface, with no soil incorporation, at a rate of 200 mg kg- 1 N. Experimental units consisted of PVC tubes with a diameter of 0. 15 m, containing 1. 0 kg of soil (dry basis). Ammonia volatilization was measured for 56 days following fertilizer application to the soil using sponge discs impregnated with phosphoric acid and glycerin, which were fitted inside the tubes 0. 15 m above the soil surface. Ammonia volatilization peaks varied according to the fertilizer, and most of them occurred in the first 15 days following application to the soil. Total ammonia volatilized from the soil treated with PL or OMF had no influence on the <b>urease</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> probably because the losses were small, attaining a maximum of 2. 5 and 9 % of the total N applied, respectively.

40|$|The {{development}} of new nitrogen fertilizers is necessary to optimize crop production whilst improving the environmental aspects arising {{from the use of}} nitrogenous fertilization as a cultural practice. The use of <b>urease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> aims to improve the efficiency of urea as a nitrogen fertilizer by preventing its loss from the soil as ammonia. However, although the action of <b>urease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> is aimed at the urease activity in soil, their availability for the plant may affect its urease activity. The aim of this work was therefore to evaluate the effect of two <b>urease</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> namely acetohydroxamic acid (AHA) and N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT), on the germination of pea and spinach seeds. The results obtained show that <b>urease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> do not affect the germination process to any significant degree, with the only process affected being imbibition in spinach, thus also suggesting different urease activities for both plants.

One important approach for reducing these problems involves the application of <b>urease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> to soil in conjunction with urea fertilizer. This study was designed to investigate the ability of phenylphosphorodiamidate (PPD), N-(nbutyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) and cyclohexyl phosphoric triamide (CHPT) and nitrohumic acids derived from coal to act as soil <b>urease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> in various soil conditions. A number of preliminary experiments were conducted to determine the effects of soil water content, pH and autoclaving on soil urease activity. It was found that soil urease activity increased with an increase in soil pH from 5 to 9. Varying the soil water content caused minor effects on soil urease activity, while autoclaving caused an immediate marked reduction in activity which was regained over a 4 -week period. The effects of <b>urease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> PPD, NBPT and CHPT on soil urease activity under various conditions (temperature, buffer pH and water content) were determined. An incubation experiment involving the use of nitrohumic acids (derived from brown coal) (NHA and ANH) and NBPT was carried out to compare the effects of NHA and ANH on urea hydrolysis and associated reactions in soils. In these studies, NBPT was found to be the most effective urease inhibitor in both alkaline and acid soils; PPD was more effective in acidic than in alkaline soil because this compound degraded rapidly in alkaline conditions; CHPT was more effective in alkaline soils than in acidic soils for the inhibition of soil urease activity. Degradation of CHPT tended to be rapid with low pH systems under waterlogged conditions. A kinetic study was performed by determining the rates of urea hydrolysis at different substrate concentrations and with various concentrations of <b>urease</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> The mode of action of the <b>urease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> (PPD, NBPT and CHPT) was determined to be noncompetitive. Germination tests indicated that the application of <b>urease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> NBPT, PPD and CHPT had no adverse effects on seed germination when they were applied at a concentration of less than 50 ?g/g soil. The effects of NBPT, PPD and CHPT on wheat growth, and urea-N uptake were studied in a pot experiment. Results indicated that the presence of <b>urease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> applied at 0. 5 - 1. 0 % of the urea application rate did not significantly influence the dry matter production of wheat plants or N uptake by the plants.

For this, an experiment in field was performed in the crop year 2008 / 09, at the UFSM in Santa Maria/RS. A random block in factorial scheme (2 x 5), with the factor A consisting of two nitrogen (N) sources, urea and urea coated with B and Cu (<b>urease</b> <b>inhibitor)</b> and the factor B consisting of different intervals of water intake (0, 3, 6, 9, 12 days) after the application of N sources. The results demonstrated that the <b>urease</b> <b>inhibitor</b> slows and decreases the conversion of N to NH 3, reducing the losses by volatilization, comparatively to urea without inhibitor. Between the systems, the losses were increased in the no-tillage system. The <b>urease</b> <b>inhibitor</b> does not add benefits to the productivity in both cropping systems used and the stress caused on the rice plant by the delay of water intake is more harmful than the losses caused by the volatilization of N-NH 3...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Nitrogen {{losses by}} ammonia (NH 3) {{volatilization}} {{can be reduced}} by appropriate irrigation management or by alternative N sources, replacing urea. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the efficiency of irrigation management and N source combinations in decreasing NH 3 volatilization from an Argissolo Vermelho Distrófico típico cultivated for 28 years with black oat (Avena strigosa) and maize (Zea mays), under no-tillage in the region of Depressão Central, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The experiment was arranged in a randomized block design with split plots with three replications, where the main plots consisted of irrigation systems: no irrigation; irrigation immediately before and irrigation immediately after fertilization. The subplots were treated with different N sources: urea, urea with <b>urease</b> <b>inhibitor</b> and slow-release fertilizer, at an N rate of 180 kg ha- 1, broadcast over maize, plus a control treatment without N fertilization. Ammonia volatilization was assessed using semi-open static collectors for 1, 2, 4, 6, and 10 days after N fertilization. In general, more than 90 % of total NH 3 -N losses occurred until three days after N fertilization, with peaks up to 15. 4 kg ha- 1 d- 1. The irrigation was efficient to reduce NH 3 losses only when applied after N fertilization. However, reductions varied according to the N fertilizer, and were higher for urea (67 %) and slightly lower for urea with <b>urease</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (50 %) and slow-release fertilizer (40 %), compared with the mean of the treatments without irrigation and irrigation before fertilization. The use of urea with <b>urease</b> <b>inhibitor</b> instead of urea was only promising under volatilization-favorable conditions (no irrigation or irrigation before N fertilization). Compared to urea, slow-release fertilizer did not reduce ammonia volatilization in any of the rainfed or irrigated treatments...|$|R
40|$|Research {{has shown}} that surface {{applications}} of nitrogenous fertilizers on no-till (NT) corn generally result in crop yields lower than similar application rates on conventional till (CT) corn. Since urea is a common N fertilizer, two field studies were conducted (1982 and 1983) to characterize urea hydrolysis, nitrification, denitrification, immobilization and nitrate leaching in NT and CT systems. Research has also indicated that <b>urease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> may improve the efficiency of surface-applied, urea-based fertilizers. A field study was established to {{study the effects of}} six phosphoroamide <b>urease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> on urea hydrolysis, NH(, 3) volatilization, and other N transformations from urea N applied to the soil surface in NT and CT systems. ^ Following a surface application of urea-ammonium nitrate urea, (NH(, 4)) (, 2) SO(, 4) and Ca(NO(, 3)) (, 2) the inorganic and organic N fractions contained 50...|$|E

40|$|Flurofamide (N-[diaminophosphinyl]- 4 -fluorobenzamide), a <b>urease</b> <b>{{inhibitor}},</b> was {{a potent}} inhibitor {{of the growth}} of Ureaplasma urealyticum. As little as 10 microM flurofamide (2 micrograms/ml) prevented any growth, but U. urealyticum survived for about eight hours before colony counts become undetectable. Flurofamide was a specific inhibitor of U. urealyticum since it did not inhibit growth of four Mycoplasma species or Acholeplasma hippikon. Flurofamide was 1, 000 times more active than acetohydroxamic acid and thus has promise as a chemotherapeutic agent and a biochemical tool...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{work in our}} {{laboratory}} {{showed that}} the adverse effect of urea fertilizer on seed germination and seedling growth in soil is due to ammonia produced through hydrolysis of urea by soil urease (NH 2 CONH 2 + H 2 O → 2 NH 3 + CO 2) and can be eliminated by amending the fertilizer {{with a small amount}} of a <b>urease</b> <b>inhibitor</b> such as phenylphosphorodiamidate. Because the leaf-tip necrosis often observed after foliar fertilization of plants with urea is usually attributed to ammonia formed through hydrolysis of urea by plant urease, we studied the possibility that this necrosis could be eliminated or reduced by adding phenylphosphorodiamidate to the urea fertilizer. We found that, although addition of this <b>urease</b> <b>inhibitor</b> to foliar-applied urea increased the urea content and decreased the ammonia content and urease activity of soybean [Glycine max. (L.) Merr. ] leaves fertilized with urea, it increased the leaf-tip necrosis observed after fertilization. We conclude that this necrosis resulted from accumulation of toxic amounts of urea rather than from formation of toxic amounts of ammonia. This conclusion was supported by our finding that the necrotic areas of soybean leaves treated with urea or with urea and phenylphosphorodiamidate contained much higher concentrations of urea than did the nonnecrotic areas...|$|R
