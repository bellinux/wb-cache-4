40|$|The {{influences}} of pulp type, content of acidic groups (i. e., sulfonic and carboxylic groups) in CTMP, kappa number (i. e., residual lignin content) of un{{bleached kraft pulp}}, and beating degree of bleached kraft pulp on the conductivity of polyaniline (PAn) -coated conductive paper were investigated. The amounts of PAn coated on <b>chemical</b> <b>pulps</b> were higher than those coated on high yield pulps, and the surface resistivities of conductive papers prepared from <b>chemical</b> <b>pulps</b> were lower than those prepared from high yield pulps. As the substrates {{for the production of}} PAn-coated conductive paper, bleached <b>chemical</b> <b>pulps</b> were better than <b>unbleached</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>pulps.</b> The conductivity had a significant positive linear correlation with the amount of PAn coated. The amount of PAn coated increased with increasing content of sulfonic groups in CTMP or decreasing kappa number of unbleached kraft pulp. We hypothesized that this might be associated with the ionizability of acidic groups and the inhibiting effect of lignin on aniline polymerization. The beating degree of pulp seemed to have an insignificant effect on the conductivity of PAn-coated conductive paper. As a whole, the interpretations of the influence of the chemical composition are based on proposed ideas and need to be confirmed by future experimental work...|$|R
30|$|Eight {{different}} residual lignins {{isolated from}} <b>unbleached</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>pulps</b> [sulfite, kraft, alkaline sulfite-anthraquinone-methanol (ASAM), soda/AQ/MeOH] of spruce and beech were characterized using gel permeation chromatography (GPC), thioacidolysis, and desulfurization to determine average molecular weight, amounts of uncondensed β-O- 4 linkages, and dimeric linkage patterns, respectively. The total amounts of G-CHSEt-CHSEt-CH 2 SEt and S-CHSEt-CHSEt-CH 2 SEt were markedly reduced in residual lignins to 40 % to 80 % {{of the values}} for the corresponding milled wood lignins (MWLs). The number of dimeric units determined by thioacidolysis and desulfurization of the residual lignins was decreased by onehalf to one-fifth compared to the MWLs. Among the diverse types of dimeric units, reduction of β- 1 and β- 5 units was significant {{in most of the}} residual lignins, with the exception of beech ASAM residual lignin. Compared to beech MWL, 40 % more C 6 –C 3 main monomers were detected, whereas the relative composition of the dimeric units in the beech residual lignin was very similar to that in the beech MWL. The average molecular weights of residual lignins were less than those of the MWLs. However, the average molecular weights of the spruce kraft and soda residual lignins were determined to be higher than those of the corresponding MWLs.|$|R
40|$|Polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEM) {{consisting}} of cationic starch and anionic carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) {{have been applied}} to different pulp fibres {{in order to enhance}} the out-of-plane sheet strength properties of a typical packaging board furnish. An <b>unbleached</b> softwood <b>chemical</b> <b>pulp</b> was treated with multilayers {{consisting of}} two layers of cationic starch and one layer of CMC, and then mixed with different mechanical and chemimechanical pulps. Hand sheets were prepared with the aid of the Rapid Köthen sheet former from stocks consisting of 20 % treated <b>chemical</b> <b>pulp</b> and 80 % mechanical or chemimechanical pulp, which was either PGW from spruce, HT-CTMP from spruce or birch, or a standard spruce CTMP. Multilayer treatment significantly improved Scott Bond values and in some cases improved the tensile index, with the achieved effects being significantly larger than the effects of applying starch alone. Positive effects were obtained by treating only 20 % of the furnish, showing a very high efficiency of the adsorbed multilayers. Compared to earlier work, one important finding was that the PEM treatment should preferably be applied only to the <b>chemical</b> <b>pulp</b> and not on the entire stock. It was possible to increase the out-of-plane strength properties, measured as Scott Bond values, with just a very small increase in density of the sheets. Multilayer treatment of the <b>chemical</b> <b>pulp</b> improved the joint strength between the fibres while maintaining the high bulk of the sheets prepared from the stiff mechanical and chemimechanical fibres...|$|R
50|$|A liquid {{packaging}} board {{might be}} up to five plies and is formed on a multi-ply paper machine with online coating. The most common is to use three plies with a basis weight of about 300 g/m2. The base or middle ply is normally made of pulp from bleached or <b>unbleached</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>pulp,</b> CTMP or broke (waste paper from a paper machine). CTMP gives more bulk and stiffness. The top ply (inside) is made of bleached chemical pulp. The barrier coating depend of the application and might be applied on both sides. When induction welding is employed an aluminum foil layer is used for barrier protection and for heating. The {{back side of the}} board is the printing side and might have an extra ply made from chemical pulp of quality that is suitable for the printing applications.

40|$|The thesis {{has been}} carried out {{as a part of the}} Master of Science in {{mechanical}} engineering at Karlstads University. The purpose of the study was to evaluate how different variables affect the tearing resistance in a multi-ply paperboard. The paperboard’s final quality is dependent on several different process – and recipe variables and has, in this study, been analyzed with respect to ply grammage, ply composition and refining energies. This was investigated by manufacturing of anisotropic sheets consisting of four plies and isotropic sheets consisting of single-ply sheets. The multi-ply sheets were manufactured where one variable at a time were tested at different values. The single-ply sheets were manufactured of pure pulps with the refining energy being varied. A total of nineteen unique multi-ply sheets and twelve unique single-ply sheets were manufactured. All sheets were tested with respect to the properties including tensile strength, bending stiffness, tear strength and delamination strength. The study shows that an improvement in tearing resistance is obtained when the amount of CTMP-pulp in the center plies 2 and 3 decreases simultaneously as the amount of broke-pulp and <b>unbleached</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>pulp</b> in the same plies increases. The consequence of this improvement is reduced thickness and thereby reduced bending stiffness. The study also shows that several pulps has an optimal degree of refining for maximizing tear strength in paperboard. The major source of error is believed to be the method of manufacturing. It is also possible that the amount of test points has been too few to be able to see any clear trends for several variables...|$|E

40|$|Biological pulping (biological pre{{treatment}}) {{has been}} an area {{where it has been}} stated {{that there is a need}} for a “breakthrough technology”. Biological pulping is the treatment of lignocellulosic materials with oxidative lignin-degrading microorganism enzymes prior to pulping process. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of different biomass concentration on biological pretreatment to <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> process. By using three different concentrations of biomass (B 1, B 2 and B 3) banana stem waste will be treated through biological pretreatment. Treated banana stem waste will be proceeding to <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> process.

Compositions of lignin, cellulose and glucose have been analyzed before and after biological pretreatment and after <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> process by using different method and procedures. From this study, the higher biomass concentration gives the higher percentage of lignin degradation. Biological pretreatment shows the positive response to <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> process where banana stem waste that have been treat in biological pretreatment process degrade the lignin in the short period of time in <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> process where it takes only 30 minutes to degrade the lignin compare to 2 hours <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> processes that have been stated in the literature review.

50|$|The {{two major}} classifications of <b>pulp</b> are <b>chemical</b> and mechanical. <b>Chemical</b> <b>pulps</b> {{formerly}} used a sulphite process, but the kraft process is now predominant.

50|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>pulps,</b> such {{as those}} from the kraft process or sulfite pulping, contain much less lignin than {{mechanical}} pulps, (<5% compared to approximately 40%). The goal in bleaching <b>chemical</b> <b>pulps</b> is to remove essentially all of the residual lignin, hence the process {{is often referred to}} as delignification. Sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) was initially used to bleach <b>chemical</b> <b>pulps,</b> but was largely replaced in the 1930s by chlorine. Concerns about the release of organochlorine compounds into the environment prompted the development of Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) and Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching processes.|$|R
40|$|Ultraviolet {{resonance}} Raman spectroscopy (UVRRS) {{was applied}} to determine the characteristic vibrations of several monomeric and dimeric lignin model compounds. The characteristic vibrations of p-hydroxyphenyl, guaiacyl, and syringyl lignin structures were then detected in the UVRR spectra of extracted wood samples. Further, a partial least squares (PLS) model was developed to assist {{the determination of the}} characteristic UVRR bands of different lignin structures. The UVRRS-PLS method was further applied to interpret the more complex lignin spectra. The results correlated well with the results obtained by Py-GC/FID for the quantification of guaiacyl and syringyl lignin structures and with results obtained by NMR spectroscopy for the quantification of condensed lignin structures in guaiacyl-type lignin. Chromophoric lignin structures were studied by exciting pulp samples in the visible range. The overwhelming fluorescence emission was suppressed by applying a carbon disulfide (CS 2) based Kerr gate technique. The fluorescence rejection ratio was estimated to be as high as 250. Chromophores in chlorine dioxide and peroxide bleached pulps were of different nature, as indicated by the different correlations with brightness and kappa number. Residual lignin and hexenuronic acids in the <b>unbleached</b> and bleached <b>chemical</b> <b>pulps</b> were quantified with PLS calibration and with direct band height ratios. PLS calibration gave relatively good predictions, while the direct band height ratio was more a straightforward method. The band height ratio method is not, however, applicable to unbleached pulps with lignin contents of about 5 % because in these pulps the cellulose bands are indiscernible and cannot be used as a reference band. Carbonyl groups in cellulosic pulps were studied by the UVRRS and by the CCOA (carbazole- 9 -carbonyloxyamine) method, which showed that part of the carbonyls exist in hydrate, hemiacetal and/or hemiketal forms. It was also shown that these structures interconvert upon drying and wetting of the pulps. UVRRS was efficient in detecting extremely low contents of carbonyls, unlike IR spectroscopy, which did not detect any differences in the carbonyl band of these pulps. reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Pulping is {{the term}} used for the process which {{separates}} wood fibers. <b>Chemical</b> <b>pulping,</b> dissolving the lignin in the wood to create a pulp, is {{the most commonly used}} <b>pulping</b> process. <b>Chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> creates higher sheet strength than mechanical pulping; however, yields 40 to 50 percent pulp, where mechanical pulping yields 95 percent pulp. The two main types of <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> are the more common sulfate pulping (most commonly known as Kraft pulping) and sulfite pulping. Kraft pulping accommodates a variety of tree species, recovers and reuses all <b>pulping</b> <b>chemicals,</b> and creates a paper with a higher sheet strength. Sulfite pulp, however, is easier to bleach, yields more bleached pulp, and is easier to refine for papermaking. The major difference between the two types of <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> is the types of chemicals used to dissolve the lignin. This report will focus mainly on these two types of <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> and bleach plants. Pulp mills are one of the largest emission sources in Washington and a large toxic pollutant emission producer. There are eight pulp mills in Washington: six Kraft (sulfate) mills and two sulfite mills (one sulfite mill has recently closed). EPA formally adopted MACT in April 1998 for certain pulping processes. Sources will have between 3 and 8 years to come into compliance with the provisions of the MACT. Emissions estimations made after MACT has become effective should be sure to take emissions limitations due to MACT into account.
