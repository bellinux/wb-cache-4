40|$|The {{agricultural}} {{production of energy}} crops is in competition to food production and discussed controversial. Therefore the academic and commercial research is focused on waste or residual biomass. A promising conversion technology {{for the production of}} high quality bio-oil, syngas and biochar from residual biomass is the Thermo-Catalytic Reforming process (TCR®); intermediate pyrolysis and integrated reforming. With an additional focus on biofuels for transportation, the downstream processing of the TCR® bio-oil offers the option to meet high standards of common fuels like gasoline or diesel. To assess the opportunities of TCR® bio-oil <b>upgrading,</b> <b>hydrotreatment</b> and rectification tests were carried out in order to produce renewable gasoline and diesel from residual or waste biomass. Product yields from hydrogenation, catalyst life and biofuel analysis gives confidence that upgrading of the TCR® bio-oil offers a suitable and efficient route to meet the high standards of common fuels with strikingly similar qualities to fossil based fractions, specifically gasoline and diesel. Furthermore the generated renewable gasoline was successfully tested in a modern EU 5 passenger car engine to assess the ability of the biofuels to substitute fossil fuel. This technology opens the door to renewable fuel refining as it is known from petroleum refineries. The Thermo-Catalytic Reforming process is a key component of the Biobattery concept developed {{within the framework of the}} Center for Energy Storage (CES) ...|$|E
40|$|Pyrolysis {{products}} from microalgae using {{two types of}} reactors, a batch and an auger, will be investigated and compared at a temperature of 500 oC. Also, the bio-oil will be <b>upgraded</b> through <b>hydrotreatment</b> {{to be used as}} a substitution of petroleum fuels. The pyrolysis products of bio-char, bio-oil, and combustible gases will be analyzed. The ultimate analysis will also completed and it shows the HHV (Higher heating value) of the bio-oil from a batch reactor. Chemical compositions of bio-oils using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) will be categorized which indicates a potential of bio-oil as a substitute for crude petroleum oil. HHV of bio-char will also evaluated and it is anticipated to contain considerable energy and to be used for additional energy sources or other applications. Then, the produced bio-oil from a batch reactor will be upgraded in a catalytic reactor. A hydrotreatment process will be applied that uses catalysts with hydrogenation and deoxygenation, which reduces the oxygen contents of bio-oil. The initial oxygen content in algae bio-oil will be reduced with catalysts while the carbon and hydrogen contents will be increased. The O/C ratio of bio-oil will be obtained and it will be compared to the O/C ratio of petroleum products (less than 0. 06). The pyrolysis results using the microalgae feedstock (N. oculata) will show that the products are potentially valuable sources of fuels and chemicals...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to evaluate the potential for the stabilization of biomass-derived pyrolysis oils by using acid-catalyzed (Amberlyst 70) reactions with alcohol (T= 140 – 170 °C, P≈ 20 bar (1 bar= 105 Pa)). The alcohol-stabilized oils were further <b>upgraded</b> by catalytic <b>hydrotreatment</b> (T= 400 °C, non-sulfided NiMo/Al 2 O 3 catalyst) to give a biofuel. The concept was evaluated experimentally in terms of overall mass and energy balances and biofuel properties. The pyrolysis oil used in this study was obtained by fractional condensation of pyrolysis vapors and had a very low water content that favored the equilibrium conversion of the stabilization reactions. The energy efficiency was between 44 and 48 %. Preliminary results with acid-leached biomass showed that 43 % of levoglucosan in the pyrolysis oil was converted into methyl levulinate after the pyrolysis oil was purified. The proposed integrated concept of alcoholysis can be applied locally at the pyrolysis oil production site...|$|R
