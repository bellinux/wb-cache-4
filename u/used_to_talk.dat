5|$|A URN is a URI that {{identifies}} a resource by {{name in a}} particular namespace. A URN may be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about a resource without implying its location or how to access it. For example, in the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) system, ISBN 0-486-27557-4 identifies a specific edition of Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet. The URN for that edition would be urn:isbn:0-486-27557-4. To {{gain access to the}} book, its location is needed, for which a URL would have to be specified.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} {{navigate}} {{and interact with}} the game's environment, mainly carriages on the Orient Express, through use of a context-sensitive cursor. The cursor changes when it is placed over an item with which the player can interact, and can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to other characters, listen to other characters' conversations, look around the environment, and move. The player can walk to a location with a single click, and run to a location with a double-click. Double-clicking {{on the edge of}} the screen instantly takes the player to the next screen. There is a map of the train in the game's interface at the top of the screen, and once each carriage has been unlocked, the player can click on any part of the map and instantly be transported to that location, saving the player from having to travel through the train screen by screen. Another accessible feature is an objectives menu interface which states the general tasks the player should be attempting to complete. This menu is designed to guide players in the right direction without giving any explicit hints.|$|E
25|$|On {{the corner}} of Dale street is a {{building}} that was opened by the Port Adelaide Market Company in 1879, divided into shops, offices and stalls. Part of the building was later adapted to make a 17-room hotel, the Newmarket. Colac Hotel, on Ocean Steamer's Road, opened in 1881. It was built opposite the then No. 1 Dock, alongside the 1879 extension to the South Australian Company basin. The hotel has had strong ties to both the Australian Labor Party and the union movement. Both former Prime Minister Bob Hawke and local Member of Parliament Mick Young <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to workers at the pub. Mick Young owned the pub from 1988–1990 and as of 2002 it was owned by the Labor Party.|$|E

[...] Fellow ESPN Anchor, Stan Verrett, {{said he was}} a trailblazer: [...] "not only because he was black – obviously black – but because of his style, his demeanor, his presentation. He did not shy away from {{the fact that he was}} a black man, and that allowed the rest of us who came along to just be ourselves." [...] He became a role model for African-American sports journalists.|$|E

(The cut-up lettering employed to create the classic Sex Pistols logo and many subsequent designs for the band was actually introduced by McLaren's friend Helen Wellington-Lloyd.) [...] "We <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to John [...] a lot about the Situationists," [...] Reid later said. [...] "The Sex Pistols seemed the perfect vehicle to communicate ideas directly to people who weren't getting the message from left-wing politics." [...] McLaren was also arranging for the band's first photo sessions. As described by music historian Jon Savage, [...] "With his green hair, hunched stance and ragged look, [...] looked like a cross between Uriah Heep and Richard Hell." ...|$|E
500|$|Veronica has a {{dream of}} the {{students}} who died in the bus crash, which takes place in [...] "Normal Is the Watchword", before she visits the guidance counselor, Rebecca (Paula Marshall), who talks to her about her problems, and Veronica tells her about her nightmares. Veronica lists the bus crash victims and asks Rebecca about a janitor named Lucky (James Jordan), whom Meg <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about a lot. Veronica describes some more dreams and tells Rebecca that she met with a student named Rhonda, who handed her a phone with a voice recording of Dick on the bus. Veronica recounts a dream encounter with her father, in which she discovered a piece of paper with the words “I am God” and pictures of nine coffins. Veronica talks to Logan about Lucky, the janitor, and Logan says that Veronica met Lucky before.|$|E

500|$|Author Craig Crawford, in {{his book}} The Politics of Life: 25 Rules for Survival in a Brutal and Manipulative World (2007), {{describes}} Cher as [...] "a model of flexible career management", and relates her career successes to a constant reshaping of her image according to the evolving trends of popular culture. He further explains that she billed [...] "each dramatic turnaround of style as another example of rebellion—an image that allowed her to make calculated changes while appearing to be consistent." [...] Author Grant McCracken stated, [...] "The term 'reinvention' is now often <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the careers of American celebrities. But in Cher's case, it is particularly apt [...] is inclined to lock on to each new fashion wave [...] is swept violently down the diffusion stream and out of fashion. Only substantial re-creation permits her to return to stardom." [...] Her [...] "integrity" [...] and [...] "perseverance" [...] are highlighted in the Reaching Your Goals book series of illustrated inspirational stories for children, in which her life is detailed emphasizing the importance of self-actualization: [...] "For years, Cher worked hard to become a successful singer. Then she worked hard to become an actress. Even when she needed money, she turned down movie roles that weren't right for her. Her goal {{has always been to}} be a good actress, not just a rich and famous one." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{another letter}} to McKellar she {{describes}} how in just five days {{she wrote the}} 60,000-word book The River of Adventure, the eighth in her Adventure Series, by listening to what she referred to as her [...] "under-mind", which she contrasted with her [...] "upper conscious mind". Blyton was unwilling to conduct any research or planning before beginning work on a new book, which coupled {{with the lack of}} variety in her life according to Druce almost inevitably presented the danger that she might unconsciously, and clearly did, plagiarise the books she had read, including her own. Gillian has recalled that her mother [...] "never knew where her stories came from", but that she <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about them [...] "coming from her 'mind's eye", as did William Wordsworth and Charles Dickens. Blyton had [...] "thought it was made up of every experience she'd ever had, everything she's seen or heard or read, much of which had long disappeared from her conscious memory" [...] but never knew the direction her stories would take. [...] Blyton further explained in her biography that [...] "If I tried to think out or invent the whole book, I could not do it. For one thing, it would bore me and for another, it would lack the 'verve' and the extraordinary touches and surprising ideas that flood out from my imagination." ...|$|E
500|$|To mark Chrissie's {{departure}} from the show, BBC Three aired a special episode of EastEnders Revealed on 22 September 2005. Entitled [...] "Chrissie Watts: Victim or Villain?" [...] the episode featured comments from Oberman, Grantham (Den), Dean (Sharon), Medcalf (Sam), Beckett (Jake), and Windsor (Peggy) profiling Chrissie and exploring the nuanced nature of the character. [...] "A lot of viewers, and myself," [...] Oberman later remarked, [...] "really wanted Chrissie {{to get away with}} it, especially as Den was such a monster. But soap and film noir {{have a lot in common}} – the bad girls have to be punished." [...] However, critics considered Chrissie to be a [...] "three-dimensional soap bitch", rather than a flat pantomime figure. Despite having killed her father, Chrissie highly valued her friendship with Sharon, declaring at one point: [...] "my friendship with you is the only good thing to come out of my relationship with Den, and I mean that!" [...] Oberman characterised Chrissie as [...] "part victim part villain", declaring [...] "I think of her as a villain with a heart". She felt that, although [...] "no excuse" [...] for murder, Chrissie was driven to what she did: [...] "She's not a cold blooded murderer, it was all done in a fit of pique", and that [...] "these characters are made, not born." [...] Chrissie was haunted by the alcoholic fate of Den's first wife, which she vowed at Angie's grave to avoid. But in spite of her efforts, and indeed because of them, she failed, as she came to recognise: [...] "You know it's funny; when Den <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about Ange he used to describe her as this weak sad, cow. And I used to think 'not like me, oh no, not like me'. Who's having the last laugh now, Ange?" ...|$|E

They are about his books. The adventures and encounters he describes in his books are on a different level of veracity. Like his friend Gabriel García Márquez, Kapuściński <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about [...] "literary reportage". You're meant to believe what you are being told, but not in every literal detail. [...] Scrupulous in his journalism, in his books {{he was capable of}} inventing {{in order to make a}} truth even truer. He was a great story-teller, but not a liar." ...|$|E

[...] Father Brosnan said. [...] "George was a nice fellow, but his wife had left him, taking their thirteen-year-old daughter with her, and he didn't have much of a life.

2500|$|Using such video {{equipment}} in the present day, the deaf, hard-of-hearing and speech-impaired can communicate between themselves and with hearing individuals using sign language. The United States and several other countries compensate companies to provide video relay service (VRS). Telecommunication equipment can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to others via a sign language interpreter, who uses a conventional telephone {{at the same time}} to communicate with the deaf person's party. Video equipment is also used to do on-site sign language translation via video remote interpreting (VRI). [...] The relative low cost and widespread availability of 3G mobile phone technology with video calling capabilities have given deaf and speech-impaired users a greater ability to communicate with the same ease as others. Some wireless operators have even started free sign language gateways.|$|E

[...] The 2002 game was lost by Texas 42–38, when defensive starters Derrick Johnson, Kalen Thornton, Marcus Tubbs and Nathan Vasher were all injured. [...] Texas' coaching staff said that injuries are not an excuse to lose a ball game. [...] Mack Brown said, [...] "It's still a loss. Nobody cares.
