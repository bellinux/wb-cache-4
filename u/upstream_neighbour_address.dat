If the station successfully participates in a ring poll, it proceeds into the final phase of insertion, request initialization.|$|R
40|$|In {{multistage}} interconnection networks {{used for}} switching in ATM, low level flow control mechanisms such as backpressure {{are used to}} regulate the flow of cells between stages to prevent cells from being lost due to buffer overflow. This is accomplished by signalling the <b>upstream</b> <b>neighbour</b> granting permission to send a cell where there is free buffer space for the cell to be received in the switch element. This paper compares the backpressure protocols designed to improve the performance of shared buffered multistage ATM networks, under uniform and non-uniform bursty traffic. We show, by simulation, that adding pushout to backpressure mechanisms in general, gives better performance. A new backpressure protocol called Intelligent Backpressure (IBP), is proposed here. Interestingly, we show that combining IBP, Restricted backpressure and pushout mechanisms together can give improved performance over the other methods, when the traffic is bursty. 1 Introduction B-ISDN is designed to carr [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} devised for numerically solving {{a class of}} finite-horizon optimal control {{problems}} subject to cascade linear discrete-time dynamics. It is assumed that the linear state and input inequality constraints, and the quadratic measure of performance, are all separable {{with respect to the}} spatial dimension of the underlying cascade of sub-systems, as well as the temporal dimension of the dynamics. By virtue of this structure, the computation cost of an interior-point method for an equivalent quadratic programming formulation of the optimal control problem can be made to scale linearly with the number of sub-systems. However, the complexity of this approach grows cubically with the time horizon. As such, computational advantage becomes apparent in situations where the number of sub-systems is relatively large. In any case, the method is amenable to distributed computation with low communication overhead and only immediate <b>upstream</b> <b>neighbour</b> sharing of partial model data among processing agents. An example is presented to illustrate an application of the main results to model data for the cascade dynamics of an automated irrigation channel...|$|R
30|$|The {{most natural}} {{explanation}} of spatiotemporal relationships in traffic flow {{is based on}} cars’ movement: if a car is observed at a spatial point, {{it is expected to}} be observed later at another, downstream point. This fact creates a background for the most popular exogenous feature filtering approach (utilised in 44 studies) – to limit spatiotemporal dependencies to one direct <b>upstream</b> <b>neighbour</b> location. This approach perfectly matches the classic macroscopic traffic flow theory, and its effectiveness for traffic volume prediction is supported by many studies. For other traffic characteristics such as speed or travel time, the direction of this relationship could be different—congestion at a downstream spatial location affects upstream traffic flow; therefore, four studies consider selection of a direct downstream neighbour as a separate alternative specification of spatiotemporal links, and 34 studies simultaneously consider direct <b>upstream</b> and downstream <b>neighbours.</b> Approaches based on direct neighbours work well if two basic conditions are satisfied: 1) a time delay interval (time lag) of phenomena (traffic volume, speed, etc.) between spatial locations is identified correctly, and 2) the analysed road segment is a linear arterial road without traffic signals or ramps. The first issue can be solved within modern forecasting methodologies, but the second one is very limiting for real world urban road networks. A potential workaround is to include the number of intersections (of different types) into the model [7], but the general treatment is to model links between neighbouring spatial locations via independent model parameters. Thus, the Bayesian network, which allows a separate identification of every link, is the most popular modern methodology (10 studies) utilising direct neighbour-based spatiotemporal FSE.|$|R

40|$|River channel {{sediment}} dynamics {{are important}} in integrated catchment management because changes in channel morphology resulting from sediment transfer {{have important implications for}} many river functions. However, application of existing approaches that account for catchment-scale sediment dynamics has been limited, largely due to the difficulty in obtaining data necessary to support them. It is within this context that this study develops a new, reach-based, stream power balance approach for predicting river channel adjustment. The new approach, named ST:REAM (sediment transport: reach equilibrium assessment method), is based upon calculations of unit bed area stream power (ω) derived from remotely sensed slope, width and discharge datasets. ST:REAM applies a zonation algorithm to values of ω that are spaced every 50 m along the catchment network in order to divide the branches of the network up into relatively homogenous reaches. ST:REAM then compares each reach’s ω value with the ω of its <b>upstream</b> <b>neighbour</b> in order to predict whether or not the reach is likely to be either erosion dominated or deposition dominated. The paper describes the application of ST:REAM to the River Taff in South Wales, UK.

50|$|Although Adam Smith and {{traditional}} thought hold that geography and transportation are the culprits for keeping LLDCs from realizing development gains, Faye, Sachs and Snow hold {{the argument that}} no matter the advancement of infrastructure or lack of geographic distance to a port, landlocked nations are still dependent on their neighbouring transit nations. Outlying this specific relationship of dependency, Faye et al. insist that though LLDCs vary across the board in terms of HDI index scores, LLDCs almost uniformly straddle {{at the bottom of}} HDI rankings in terms of region, suggesting a correlated dependency relationship of development for landlocked countries with their respective regions. In fact, HDI levels decrease as one moves inland along the major transit route that runs from the coast of Kenya, across the country before going through Uganda, Rwanda and then finally Burundi. Just recently, it has been economically modeled that if the economic size of a transit country is increased by just 1%, a subsequent increase of at least 2% is experienced by the landlocked country, which shows that there is hope for LLDCs if the conditions of their transit <b>neighbours</b> are <b>addressed.</b> In fact, some LLDCs are seeing the brighter side of such a relationship, with the Central Asian nations geographic location between three BRIC nations (China, Russia and India) hungry for the region's oil and mineral wealth serving to boost economic development.

40|$|The {{challenge}} of streamflow predictions at ungauged locations is primarily attributed to various uncertainties in hydrological modelling. Many {{studies have been}} devoted to addressing this issue. The similarity regionalization approach, a commonly used strategy, is usually limited by subjective selection of similarity measures. This paper presents an application of a partitioned update scheme based on the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to reduce the prediction uncertainties. This scheme performs real-time updating for states and parameters of a distributed hydrological model by assimilating gauged streamflow. The streamflow predictions are constrained by the physical rainfall-runoff processes defined in the distributed hydrological model and by the correlation information transferred from gauged to ungauged basins. This scheme is successfully demonstrated in a nested basin with real-world hydrological data where the subbasins have immediate <b>upstream</b> and downstream <b>neighbours.</b> The {{results suggest that the}} assimilated observed data from downstream neighbours have more important roles in reducing the streamflow prediction errors at ungauged locations. The real-time updated model parameters remain stable with reasonable spreads after short-period assimilation, while their estimation trajectories have slow variations, which may be attributable to climate and land surface changes. Although this real-time updating scheme is intended for streamflow predictions in nested basins, it can be a valuable tool in separate basins to improve hydrological predictions by assimilating multi-source data sets, including ground-based and remote-sensing observations...|$|R
50|$|A basic {{implementation}} of the OIS concept sees an optical router that monitors IP traffic and if a flow appears with specific characteristics the router establishes an optical cut-through path between its <b>upstream</b> and downstream <b>neighbours,</b> requesting the <b>upstream</b> node to place all the packets belonging to the flow into the new path. The newly generated trail bypasses the IP layer of the router, as the packets transparently flow from the upstream to the downstream neighbour. Following a similar procedure the path can then be extended to more than three nodes, but this decision is always autonomously taken by each router and depends on the traffic encountered and on the resources locally available.Since an optical link however can carry several gigabits of data per second, {{it may be difficult}} to find a flow that alone can exploit the bandwidth offered by an optical trail.For this reason, aggregating more IP flows into the same dedicated path is essential for the performance of an OIS network.The aggregation introduces a trade-off between the number of IP flows that can be aggregated together and the length of the optical trail that accommodates them.In order to achieve good performance only optical flows sharing a significant amount of network hops should be aggregated into the same path.A core node implementing optical IP switching must be endowed with electrical processing and memory resources (as a standard IP router), a variable number of optical transceivers and an optical switching element (usually a MEMS based device).An edge node instead does not need an optical switching device because it could only function as source or destination of the optical flow.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Automatic image {{annotation}} aims at {{predicting a}} set of textual labels for an image that describe its semantics. These are usually taken from an annotation vocabulary of few hundred labels. Because of the large vocabulary, {{there is a high}} variance in the number of images corresponding to different labels (“class-imbalance”). Additionally, due to the limitations of manual annotation, a significant number of available images are not annotated with all the relevant labels (“weaklabelling”). These two issues badly affect the performance of most of the existing image annotation models. In this work, we propose 2 PKNN, a two-step variant of the classical K-nearest <b>neighbour</b> algorithm, that <b>addresses</b> these two issues in the image annotation task. The first step of 2 PKNN uses “image-to-label ” similarities, while the second step uses “image-to-image ” similarities; thus combining the benefits of both. Since the performance of nearest-neighbour based methods greatly depends on how features are compared, we also propose a metric learning framework over 2 PKNN that learns weights for multiple features as well as distances together. This is done in a large margin set-up by generalizing a well-known (single-label) classification metric learning algorithm for multi-label prediction. For scalability, we implement it by alternating between stochastic sub-gradient descent and projection steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, though conceptually simple, 2 PKNN alone performs comparable to the current state-of-the-art on three challenging image annotation datasets, and shows significant improvements after metric learning. ...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{we focus}} on {{studying}} spatial database. Specifically, the Reverse k Nearest Neighbour queries in Euclidean Space. Given a set of objects and a query Q, an object p is Q’s Reverse k Nearest Neighbour if Q is one of p’s k-closest objects. With location-based services become popular in past few years, more applications {{have been developed to}} answer users queries by using users locations to search and return data from spatial database. For example, a supermarket may look for customers that itself locates at least 5 th closest to them and send promotion offers to customers or a hospital may seek other ones that itself is one of those hospitals’ 5 nearest neighbours and get ready to assist them in case emergency happens. To answer such queries, many Reverse k Nearest Neighbour queries solutions have been proposed and some of them work efficiently. However, with various users’ demands raised up on query performance and query criterion, much more efficient and suitable algorithms are still expected. To improve the query performance of state-of-the-art Reverse k Nearest Neighbour query solutions, we partition the universe into several non-overlapping rectangular regions. With the idea of Influence Zone, we pre-compute the Influence Zone for every above-mentioned region and keep all objects contributing to it. We guarantee only these contributed objects may affect final results regarding to every possible Reverse k Nearest Neighbour query in this region. Then we incorporate the most efficient on- line algorithm (SLICE) along with contributed objects to answer Reverse k Nearest <b>Neighbour</b> query. To <b>address</b> the second problem regarding to Reverse k Nearest Neighbour with various query criterion, we {{come up with a new}} cost model and propose a novel algorithm.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate the influence of Turkey’s European Union (EU) candidature on its foreign policy towards its non-EU neighbours, namely Iran and Syria. It argues that EU conditionality and adaptation pressure for the convergence and alignment of Turkey’s authoritarian political regime to the EU acquis communautaire have produced unintended outcomes in Turkey’s foreign policy towards its non-EU neighbours, in addition to the intended outcomes in Turkey’s domestic politics. To investigate these phenomena, this study poses the following questions: how, to what extent and in what direction has Turkey’s foreign policy changed towards its non-EU neighbours during the country’s EU candidature, and how has Turkey’s EU candidature to the EU played a role in this? This study utilises Europeanization, and the rational choice and historical versions of the new institutionalist theory as its theoretical framework. Interview and case study methods were employed to answer {{this research}} question, and triangulation and the creation of counterfactual scenarios were used to substantiate the validity of the study’s findings and interpretation. The findings indicate that, first, Turkish foreign policy towards its non-EU neighbours has undergone a deep transformation from being merely security-oriented disengagement to politically and economically-oriented engagement. Secondly, although 1) {{due to the nature of}} the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), the literature on Europeanisation in the field of foreign policy primarily addresses socialisation and experimental learning related to the impact of the EU on member and/or non-member states’ foreign policies, and 2) due to the nature of EU-Turkey relations, the literature on the impact of the EU on Turkey’s foreign policy mostly focus on Turkey’s foreign policy towards Turkey’s EU <b>neighbours</b> and primarily <b>addresses</b> EU conditionality and adaptation pressure in the field of foreign policy as it is related to the impact of the EU on Turkey’s foreign policy, the findings of this research show that, in fact, EU conditionality and adaptation pressure in the fields of democracy and the rule of law, and in the economic realm, has unintentionally left a very visible influence on Turkish foreign policy towards Turkey’s non-EU neighbours by: (a) changing the institutions, institutional structures and institutional power relations, (b) empowering the governmentand civil society against the military–bureaucratic elites in political decision making, (c) accomplishing political and economic stability and growth, (d) increasing respect for and protection of religious and minority rights, and transferring domestic religious and minority issues into the realm of normal politics, and thus (e) changing the institutions, interests, preferences and demands that are involved in foreign policy-making towards Turkey’s non-EU neighbours...|$|R
40|$|A {{party in}} Narre Warren has exposed the {{limitations}} of an industry that plays only to mass audiences, writes MARGARET SIMONS SOMETIMESyou need to take your eye off the ball {{in order to see}} what is happening. The silly season is traditionally a time when serious journalism rests, but this year the summer story of the year, about a 16 -year-old kid and his out-of-control party, has revealed a great deal about how journalism works in the new media world and the need for some new thought and new approaches. The kid, from outer suburban Kath and Kim territory in Melbourne?s Narre Warren, held a party without his parents? knowledge. Thanks to his placing an invitation on his Myspace page, together with a flurry of text messaging on the night, he got more guests than he bargained for. About 500 people turned up. When they spilled into the street, upsetting a neighbour?s bird bath and causing a ruckus, dozens of police came to the scene backed up by a helicopter and the drug squad. Too much has already been written about whether the kid is a cool dude or a spoilt brat, {{and the extent to which}} the parents are or are not to blame. That?s not my interest. I want to look at this story as a twenty-first century phenomenon. This kid is from McMansion territory, where every bedroom has a computer capable of publishing material to the world. His story shows us the way in which new media can both create and report on a story, and the ways in which journalism is groping towards ways to cope. Tabloid television has doled out its predictable doses of moral outrage ? which has done nothing but help the development of the kid as a media phenomenon. Under cross examination by Channel Nine?s A Current Affair, he stood bare chested, nipple ring on show and apparently completely comfortable. Over several minutes he coolly refused to be either shamed or reduced to a formula. The reporter repeatedly urged him to take off his trademark cheap plastic sunglasses, look the audience in the eye and apologise. He replied: ?I?ll say sorry but I?m not taking off my glasses? Asked what he would say to other young teenagers thinking of partying without their parents? knowledge, he said ?Get me to do it for you?. As a result it is possible on the internet to buy t-shirts emblazoned with the words ?I?ll say sorry but I?m not taking off my sunglasses. ? Meanwhile the kid has reportedly been offered big money to become an event organiser. The day after the A Current Affair interview screened, the kid wrote to his Facebook fans: ?:take it:BREAKIT ^luvin dis shit^ Ur all Tha GOOD type !!!~~~ Every 1 HiT up tha ||Cnut|| Fkn (maKe) me a groUp Offica! Sik. ? If I may interpret: he was clearly having a good time. Meanwhile he posted a clip of the interview to his Myspace profile page, and changed his image on Facebook to the one that appeared in the media the morning after the party ? semi-naked and wrapped in a pink doona. Compare this to the fate of the Paxton family in 1996. The Paxtons were emblematic of the relationship between media and the powerless at that time. The Paxtons were easy meat for tabloid moral outrage ? not media savvy enough to realise what was being done to them, let alone undermine it. Today Shane Paxton is virtually middle aged and instead we have this new kid in the lens. He is a media adept, with the ability to turn the formulas of traditional media to his own ends, and parlay the attention into a kind of commentary on media, while creating his own celebrity. I am not suggesting he is doing this consciously, nor that he is a hero or to be admired. It just happens. This generation does media, rather than only consuming it or being its subject. The mainstream media, meanwhile, has been largely left to report on what is happening on the internet in much the same way as it would report on other public spaces, such as parliaments and the courts. The language of the stories gives the game away. Journalists are reporting on the kid for the benefit of those who are not themselves denizens of Facebook (or Facepage, as the Herald-Sun mis-named it) or Myspace. Thus journalists define not only themselves but also their audiences as spectators, rather than participants in the process. The kid and his friends are doing media, the audiences of traditional media are expected just to watch. There is a generational issue as well. Much of the reporting has implicitly assumed that the audience is older than the participants in the story. A fair assumption, but hardly a healthy one for traditional media wanting to engage young readers. At some levels traditional media it isn?t coping at all. At the time of writing, this kid is facing charges, which means that because he is a child, it is against the law to name him. Nevertheless, you can look at this Myspace page or this Facebook site or simply Google ?Narre Warren? and ?teenager? and ?party? and find out his name in an instant ? together with his address, his mobile phone number and his family history. Partly this is because mainstream media reports written weeks ago live on in the online world, but it is also because the kid and his friends are creating their own media content, including by cutting and pasting stuff the mainstream media has done. The internet is awash with pictures of the kid, his nipple ring, his bleached blonde hair and his sunglasses. The bloggers and social networkers are naming the kid every day, with no apparent care or awareness that they are breaking the law. The authorities are hardly likely to pursue dozens of ordinary citizens and children for contempt, yet journalists are in the strange position of having to toe the line, since it it is likely action would be taken if they didn?t. This makes the law look foolish, of course, but also highlights the challenge of he new media age. Journalists, because of their institutional affiliations ? their place at the heart of the establishment ? are less able to inform the public than ordinary citizens. The citizens are providing the information for themselves. Of course, big business is adept at cashing in. The internet classified site realestate. com. au was quick to cash in on the kid?s ?brand? by using an image of a teenager very similar to the one in question ? complete with blonde hair and yellow rimmed sunglasses ? to encourage people to look for a new house. The advertising trade magazine B&T reported a spokesperson for the site as saying: ?We have been following the story closely and thought about what it would be like to have 500 people at a party near to where you live, and what would motivate the neighbours to move. The marketing department came up with the idea and we had it checked by our lawyers so decided to run with it. ? So is the kid a victim after all ? his image stolen and made into a commodity? Not really, or not entirely. The kid?s supporters ? or perhaps the kid himself ? hit back with a spoof ad on the rival Domain site. Interested buyers were invited to snap up the $ 20, 000 bargain boasting a host of features including ?NO RentS, NO oLDieZ? a ?massif outdoor entertaining area!? a garden with ?trashed flowerbeds? and "FREE security provided by Copz N Dawg Squad. ? Meanwhile a debate has broken out on the discussions page of the online encyclopaedia Wikipedia about whether this kid (who is of course freely named) merits an entry under the sites ?notability? policy, or whether this is a case of ?recentism,? meaning that his star will fade within the month. This discussion includes reflections on whether the international community that is Wikipedia has the right, or the ability, to comment on what is significant in Australian culture. In other words, there is enough in this saga to fuel media studies and sociology classes for at least a semester. Even the nature of the charges the kid is facing tells a new media tale. One of them is making child pornography. This reportedly relates to pictures he took of girls at the party with his mobile phone. It would be wrong to say the traditional media has completely failed to cope. Google the boy?s name and you will find that although the mainstream media cannot name him, News Limited has bought Google ads activated by his name, and is promoting this site with the words ?everything (boy?s name), news here? The site aggregates all the news, including an open letter to the public from the kid?s parents, and the latest news that he and his folks have agreed to ?give each other some space? until the furor dies down. They may be waiting a while. So what does this tell us about how journalists, need to change? How might the job of reporting by professional journalists be done better, in a more relevant way? Indeed, is there any role at all for journalists in a saga like this one? One of the lessons we should take away is about audiences. Mass media is no longer the only, nor even necessarily the main, game in town. The kid?s party was a media event long before it was reported by journalists. The kid had already informed a niche audience about it through his Myspace page. One of the things that has hobbled the mainstream media in its reporting is that it plays only to mass audiences. No professional journalist serves or works with the kid and his peers, or reports to them, or researches stories for them. Yet wouldn?t these kids be well served by a journalists? traditional skills? Wouldn?t they gain from, say, a Freedom of Information request to the Victorian Police to reveal the mechanisms behind the calling out of the dog squad? Or a tough interview with police commissioner Christine Nixon? On the other hand, wouldn?t they be challenged by a series of up close interviews with the <b>neighbours,</b> <b>addressed</b> directly at them, about how frightened they were on the night of the party? Historically, journalism has served to link communities and build common interests. We might not all think the same way, but since the printing press led to the growth of modern media it is likely that we have been thinking about the same sorts of things. We have had a common ?front page? of concerns. This can no longer be taken for granted. Surely, though, the job of the journalist needs to continue in the new media age. The kid and his friends need to be brought into the tent, engaged with the broader society. Or perhaps we need to be brought into their tent. We need to be connected. There are several intersecting communities involved in this story. The kid and his guests. The neighbours. The community of Narre Warren. The people of Victoria. The police. The community of Wikipedia. Isn?t part of the job of journalism to serve, create and engage these communities ? to get them talking to each other? The problem is obvious, though. At present there is no business model to support this kind of journalism. Niche audiences don?t draw enough advertisers or pay enough to support professional journalists. The story of this kid, continuing all over the place even as I write, tells us that new ways will have to be found. Meanwhile, I gather from Facebook that the kid is planning another party, in ?Narre,? in a few weeks? time. The media are bound to be there, but they will be confronted by dozens of mobile phone cameras, digicams and so forth ? wielded by the guests. ?
