40|$|Objective: We have {{developed}} an ultrapurified low endotoxin alginate (<b>UPLE</b> alginate), which can drastically reduce endotoxin levels. Our purposes were {{to examine the effects}} of <b>UPLE</b> alginate administration on osteoarthritis (OA) progression and to determine the adequate molecular weight of the <b>UPLE</b> alginate for therapeutic effects. Design: To induce knee OA, 35 Japanese White rabbits underwent anterior cruciate ligament transection. Intra-articular injections of 0. 3 mL solution of each material were started at 4 weeks postoperatively for a total of 5 weekly injections. Seventy knees were divided into the following groups: AL 430 (430 kDa molecular weight <b>UPLE</b> alginate), AL 1000 (1, 000 kDa), AL 1700 (1, 700 kDa), HA (hyaluronan), and NS (normal saline). At 9 weeks postoperatively, all knees were assessed macroscopically, histologically, and mechanically. Results: Macroscopically, the <b>UPLE</b> alginate groups exhibited milder cartilage degradation compared to that of the NS and HA groups. Histological findings of the <b>UPLE</b> alginate groups showed an obvious reduction in the severity of OA. The histological scores of Kikuchi et al. were superior in the alginate treatment groups compared to the NS group. The friction coefficient of the AL 1000 group was significantly lower than that of the NS and HA groups. Conclusion: This study indicates that our <b>UPLE</b> alginates, especially AL 1000, have promising potential as an effective agent in preventing OA progression...|$|R

The asthenosphere is represented as a highly viscous Newtonian fluid that is nonrotating, Bo. ussinesq, incompressible, and nondissipative. A sequence of two-dimensional model problems is considered in an effort to understand the dynamic role of various energy sources available in the upper mantle. The first models investigate the role of vertical temperature gradients and find these incapable of generating flows in the asthenosphere that move overlying lithospheric plates by viscous traction. By considering the combined effect of horizontal and vertical temperature gradients, a mechanism for effecting the original breakup of large continental masses is suggested. The dynamic role of phase changes is investigated in a series of finite-amplitude model problems.

40|$|Abstract. There is {{a growing}} demand for {{multipoint}} multimedia services over IP and an explosion of VPN services. Nowadays, multipoint QoS services need to be extended beyond provider boundaries. This manuscript studies the tree-constrained tree-optimization problem with directional metrics. Weights and constraints are not applied to an arc but to a 3 <b>uple</b> (a, b, c) of vertices named a directional arc, composed of two simple arcs: one incoming and one outgoing, to and from a given transit node b. This cost and routing model is well suited to represent complex Autonomous System (AS) interactions. In this way an AS can apply different policies based on {{the direction of the}} flow. Although the constrained Steiner problem with directional metrics may be relaxed to its classical form by extending the graph with directional metrics to a larger graph with legacy metrics, this transformation increases the complexity of the problem. We formulate the problem directly and devise an ad-hoc breadth-first search approach with limited depth for its resolution. We analyze the time computational complexity and the optimality of our heuristic. We show that taking advantage of pre-computation, our algorithm reaches solutions very close to optimality and appears to be more competitive, less complex than other well known multipoint routing algorithms. ...|$|R

It is well known, {{and easy to}} see, {{that there is a}} solution to this problem. In this paper, we consider uniqueness of the vector (P 1 Q,P 2 Q,⋯,PmQ) of rational functions, which may be regarded as simultaneous Hermite-Padé approximants to (f 1,f 2,⋯,fm). For special classes of functions, uniqueness has been proved, but the uniqueness problem has not been solved in general. We show that even when f 1,f 2,⋯,fm are “independent” in a strong sense, there may be uncountably many distinct vectors (P 1 Q, P 2 Q,⋯PmQ) solving the problem. Moreover, the degree of non-uniqueness is the same as in the problem to find Q of degree ≤σ−ϱ 0, and a single P 1 of degree ≤σ−ϱ 1 satisfying (f 1 −P 1) (z) =O(zσ+ 1). When compared to the classical Padé problem (f 1 Q−P 1) (z) =O(z(σ−ϱ 0) +(σ−ϱ 1) + 1), this indicates that the number of degrees of freedom, or non-uniqueness, is σ−(ϱ 0 +ϱ 1) ...|$|R

On the other hand, the b-quark mass generation is also a consequence of chiral U(3) _Q× U(3) _d symmetry breaking. Therefore, in many models, there might be strong correlation between the b→ sγ and b quark Yukawa coupling. We use non-decoupling MSSM model to illustrate this feature. The light Higgs boson may evade the direct search experiments at LEPII or Tevatron while the 125 GeV Higgs-like boson is identified as the heavy Higgs boson in the spectrum. A light charged Higgs {{is close to the}} heavy Higgs boson which is of 125 GeV and its contribution to b→ s γ requires large supersymmetric correction with large PQ and R symmetry breaking.

Variables currentlyimplemented in the model include salinity,suspended matter, oxygen, inorganic carbonspecies, degradable organic carbon andnitrogen, inorganic nitrogen species,freshwater and marine phytoplankton. Biologicalprocesses described are heterotrophicrespiration, primary production, nitrificationand denitrification. Equilibrium formulationsallow for DIC and NH 4 + /NH 3 speciation. Physical processes include gastransfer at the water/air interface, dependingon both wind speed and current velocity. pHprofiles are explicitly computed and constitutea very sensitive check of the overall modelconsistency. Results of the CONTRASTE model arein very good agreement with the measuredlongitudinal distribution of the variablesconsidered, in particular O 2, pH,pCO 2 and N 2 O concentrations.

40|$|Past {{changes in}} {{seawater}} lead (Pb) isotopes record the temporal evolution of anthropogenic pollution, continental weathering inp uts, and ocean current transport. To advance {{our ability to}} reconstruct this signature, we present methodological developments {{that allow us to}} make precise and accurate Pb isoto pe measurements on deep-sea coral aragonite, and apply our approach to generate the f irst Pb isotope record for the glacial to deglacial mid-depth Southern Ocean. Our refined methodology includes a two-step anion e xchange chemistry procedure and measurement using a 207 Pb- 204 Pb double spike on a ThermoFinnigan Triton TIMS instrument. By employing a 10 12 Ω resistor (in place of a 10 Ω resistor) to measure the low- abundance 204 Pb ion beam, we improve the internal precision on 206, 207, 208 Pb/ 204 Pb for a 2 ng load of NIST-SRM- 981 Pb from typically ~ 420 ppm to ~ 260 ppm (2 s. e.), and the long term external reproducibility from ~ 960 ppm to ~ 580 ppm (2 s. d.). Furthermore, for a typical 500 mg coral sample with low Pb concentrations (~ 6 - 10 p pb yielding ~ 3 - 5 ng Pb for analysis), we obtain a comparable internal precision of ~ 150 - 250 ppm for 206, 207, 208 Pb/ 204 Pb, indicating a good sensitivity for tracing natural Pb sources to the oceans. Successful extraction of a seawater signal from deep-sea coral aragonite furth er relies on careful physical and chemical cleaning steps, which are necessary to remove anthr opogenic Pb contaminants and obtain results that are consistent with ferromanganese cru sts. Applying our approach to a collection of late glaci al and deglacial corals (~ 12 - 40 ka BP) from south of Tasmania at ~ 1. 4 - 1. 7 km water dep th, we generated the first intermediate water Pb isotope record from the Southern Ocean. Th at record reveals millennial timescale variability, controlled by binary mixing between tw o Pb sources, but no distinct glacial- interglacial Pb isotope shift. Mixing between natur al endmembers is fully consistent with our data and points to a persistence of the same Pb sou rces through time, although we cannot rule out a minor influence from recent anthropogenic Pb. Whereas neodymium (Nd) isotopes in the Southern Ocean respond to global ocean circulat ion changes between glacial and interglacial periods, Pb isotopes record more local ised mixing within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, potentially further modulated by climate through changing terrestrial inputs from southern Africa or Australia. Such deco <b>upling</b> between Pb and Nd isotopes in the Southern Ocean highlights their potential to provid e complementary insights into past oceanographic variability...|$|R
40|$|As each {{production}} process introduces residual stresses in the material, cold-rolled steel tubes are not delivered stress-free. The motivation o f this research {{can be traced}} back to the laser cutting of tubes. During the cutting process, residual stresses are relieved, which causes defor mation of the tube and a reduction of the precision of cut. Residual str esses also play a role in stress corrosion and sudden collapse of tubula r structures. This work concentrates on the residual stresses in cold-rolled steel tub es due to the welding process. Insight into the origin, influencing para meters, distribution and magnitude is gained with a finite element (FE) simulation of the welding process. An FE model allows for the visualisat ion of these aspects in the entire tube. A welding simulation requires t he quantification of numerous input parameters: thermal and thermomechan ical material properties (and their evolution at elevated temperatures), thermal and mechanical boundary conditions, and a model for the heat-in put of the welding torch. The simulation is split up into a thermal anal ysis which calculates the temperature field in the tube during the weldi ng and subsequent cooling and a thermomechanical simulation which calcul ates the deformation and stress. Since welding simulations require an appropriate value for numerous para meters, validation of the simulation results is of utmost importance. Fo r this purpose, a laboratory setup which allows measuring the temperatur es and deformations during the welding of the tube is built. The tempera tures are measured with 5 thermocouples. The deformation is measured wit h strain gauges and the digital image correlation (DIC) technique. Although DIC has some advantages over other techniques measuring deforma tions during welding, to the author's knowledge it is the first time tha t DIC is used in a welding application. First, it is investigated whethe r it is possible to measure the thermal expansion of the types of stainl ess steel used in this work (austenitic SS 304 and ferritic SS 409) on 3 D objects. It is shown that this is possible up to 600 &# 176;C. From these measu rements the thermal expansion coefficient is determined, and this is use d as input in the thermomechanical simulations. Although the strain that occurs in the welding is rather small compared to common DIC applicatio ns, the strain evolution during the welding and subsequent cooling of th e tube can be recognised easily. These strain evolutions are in agreemen t with the strain evolution measured with the strain gauges. Strain gaug es have in this application the disadvantage that the measured strain mu st be compensated for the actual material temperature, which makes their result dependent on this temperature measurement. In the thermal simulation, the predicted temperature field is brought in agreement with the measured temperature field. For this purpose, the va lue of three poorly known input parameters was optimised: (i) the effici ency of the welding process; (ii) the actual room temperature around the setup; and (iii) the convection film coefficient. This procedure result s in physically acceptable values for these parameters. The difference b etween the measured and the simulated temperature curves at the thermoco <b>uple</b> points is minimised, but they are certainly not yet coincident, whi ch is directly reflected in the simulated strain evolutions. In the thermomechanical simulation, the thermal field is combined with t he thermal dilatation of the material to calculate the stress and strain evolution during the welding process. The tube in the experiments was s ubjected to a stress relief treatment before the experiment was started and also the simulations start from a stress-free tube. The simulated st rain evolutions are compared with the measured ones. The residual stress profile in the middle section of the tube is compared to an X-ray diffr action residual stress measurement. A sensitivity analysis shows that pa rameter variations are visible in both the strain evolution and in the r esidual stress profile. Validating the simulations with the strain evolu tion is preferred to a residual stress measurement as in this way the wh ole process is checked and not just the final state. The methodology developed for a SS 304 tube with a diameter of 60 mm and w all thickness of 1. 5 mm is applied to a SS 409 tube with a diameter of 60 m m and wall thickness of 2 mm. Especially the larger heat input and the lo wer thermal expansion coefficient define this case study. The results ar e similar to the SS 304 tube, but a better material characterisation of t he SS 409 steel is necessary to improve the results. Finally, the effect of an initial residual stress field on the strain ev olution during and the residual stress after the welding is investigated. For that reason the stress/strain state inferred from exploratory roll ing simulations was implemented as initial field in the welding simulati ons. From these simulations it is concluded that the final residual stre ss pattern is mainly determined by the welding process. status: publishe...|$|R
