25|$|Morrison {{had begun}} writing fiction {{as part of}} an {{informal}} group of poets and writers at Howard University who met to discuss their work.

He practised Carnatic music for an hour each {{in the morning and}} in the evening. His punctuality is another noted aspect. Waking <b>up</b> <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> at 4 am, he performed Yoga and Pranayama, which {{is said to be the}} reason behind his physical and mental fitness. His Yoga performances can be seen in the first clips of his film Kaamana Billu. Rajkumar is the first actor of the world cinema who had mastered Yoga.|$|E

25|$|Mueller {{increasingly}} {{believed that}} {{to move up}} {{in the hierarchy of}} the Labs he would need a PhD, and he began working towards this goal on a part-time basis at Princeton University, getting <b>up</b> <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> at around 5 o'clock and driving to Princeton to take a couple of courses before driving back down to Holmdel to work all day at Bell Labs. In 1946 a colleague at the Labs, Milton Boone, a professor from Ohio State University on leave at Bell Labs during the war, encouraged Mueller to help set up a vacuum tube lab and run the communications group at Ohio State.|$|E

The album was certified double Platinum by the RIAA and sold 2.6 {{million copies in}} the United States. [...] "More than a Woman" [...] reached {{number one on the}} UK singles chart making Aaliyah the first female deceased artist to reach number one on the UK singles chart. [...] "More than a Woman" [...] was replaced by George Harrison's [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] which is the only time in the UK singles chart's history where a dead artist has replaced another dead artist at number one. In July 2001, she allowed MTV's show Diary behind-the-scenes access to her life and stated [...] "I am truly blessed to wake <b>up</b> <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> to do something that I love; there is nothing better than that." [...] She continued, [...] "Everything is worth it – the hard work, the times when you're tired, the times when you are a bit sad. In the end, it's all worth it because it really makes me happy. I wouldn't trade it for anything else in the world. I've got good friends, a beautiful family and I've got a career. I thank God for his blessings every single chance I get." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mencken countered the {{arguments}} for Anglo-Saxon superiority prevalent in his time in a 1923 essay entitled [...] "The Anglo-Saxon", which argued {{that if there was}} {{such a thing as a}} pure [...] "Anglo-Saxon" [...] race, it was defined by its inferiority and cowardice. [...] "The normal American of the 'pure-blooded' majority goes to rest every night with an uneasy feeling that there is a burglar under the bed and he gets <b>up</b> <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> with a sickening fear that his underwear has been stolen." ...|$|E

2500|$|Banville {{is highly}} scathing {{of all of}} his work, stating of his books: [...] "I hate them all ... I loathe them. They're all a {{standing}} embarrassment." [...] Instead of dwelling on the past he is continually looking forward, [...] "You have to crank yourself <b>up</b> <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> and {{think about all the}} awful stuff you did yesterday, and how you can compensate for that by doing better today." [...] He does not read reviews of his work as he already knows – [...] "better than any reviewer" [...] – the places in which its faults lie.|$|E
2500|$|Erickson was an irrepressible {{practical}} joker, {{and it was}} {{not uncommon}} for him to slip indirect suggestions into all kinds of situations, including in his own books, papers, lectures and seminars. For example, a student arrived at one of the five-day intensive seminars he held in his home office {{near the end of his}} life. When Erickson asked why she had come, she replied frankly: [...] "My teacher told me that I should come to see you before you died." [...] Erickson smiled and said: [...] "You tell him that dying is the last thing I intend to do." [...] The group laughed at the pun. Then Erickson said, with a twinkle in his eye, [...] "Do you want to know how to avoid dying? Always wake <b>up</b> <b>every</b> <b>morning.</b> And do you want to know how to ensure that you will wake up every morning?", he continued, [...] "Drink lots of liquids before you go to sleep!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2013, Beyoncé {{explained}} {{the idea behind}} [...] "Bow Down" [...] on iTunes Radio: [...] "The reason I put out 'Bow Down' is because I woke up, I went into the studio, I had a chant in my head, it was aggressive, it was angry, it wasn't the Beyoncé that wakes <b>up</b> <b>every</b> <b>morning.</b> It was the Beyoncé that was angry. It was the Beyoncé that {{felt the need to}} defend herself. And if the song never comes out…OK! I said it! And I listened to it after I finished, and I said, This is hot! I'mma put it out. I'm not going to sell it. I'm just going to put it out. People like it, great; they don't, they don't. And I won't do it every day because that's not who I am. But I feel strong. And anyone that says, 'Oh that is disrespectful,' just imagine the person that hates you. Imagine a person that doesn't believe in you. And {{look in the mirror and}} say, 'Bow down, bitch' and I guarantee you feel gangsta! So listen to the song from that point of view again if you didn't like it before." ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{week after}} {{shooting}} began, the film's production company went bankrupt, leaving the production in short supplies {{of food and}} water. Antonioni still had a large supply of film stock and {{managed to get the}} cast and crew to work for free until funding for the film was found. At one point, ships stopped making trips to Lisca Bianca and the cast and crew were stranded for three days without food or blankets. Eventually the crew went on strike and Antonioni and his Assistant Director shot the film themselves. Due to the rough condition of the sea and the difficulty in landing a ship on the rough rocks of Lisca Bianca, the cast and crew were often forced to sleep on the island. Antonioni has stated that he [...] "woke <b>up</b> <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> at 3 o'clock in order to be alone and reflect on what I was doing in order to re-load myself against fatigue and a strange form of apathy or absence of will, which often took hold of us all." [...] After several weeks of Antonioni and the crew working without a budget, the production company Cino del Duca agreed to finance the film and sent money to him.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, Wilson amassed myriad home demo {{recordings}} which later became informally {{known as the}} [...] "Bedroom Tapes". Most of these recordings remain unreleased and unheard by the public. Some of the material {{has been described as}} [...] "schizophrenia on tape," [...] and [...] "intensely personal songs of gentle humanism and strange experimentation, which reflected on his then-fragile emotional state." [...] Beach Boys archivist Alan Boyd observed: [...] "A lot of the music that Brian was creating during this period was full of syncopated exercises and counterpoints piled on top of jittery eighth-note clusters and loping shuffle grooves. You get hints of it earlier in things like the tags to 'California Girls,' 'Wouldn't It Be Nice' and all throughout Smile, but it takes on an almost manic edge in the '70s." [...] Brian's daughter Wendy remembers, [...] "Where other people might take a run to release some stress, he would go to the piano and write a 5-minute song." [...] Her sister Carnie has recounted: [...] "My memories of him are him wandering from room to room... thinking about something. I always wanted to know what he was thinking, you know? Who knows what he was thinking in his head? ... We got used to what the whole environment was. It was very musical; there was always a piano going. Either [...] "Rhapsody in Blue" [...] was playing, or..."Be My Baby"—I mean—I woke <b>up</b> <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> to boom boom-boom pow! Boom boom-boom pow! Every day." ...|$|E

5000|$|When he returned, {{he built}} a house in Drøbak. Around 1900, due to {{financial}} woes, he began getting <b>up</b> early <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> to paint several pictures that he sold at bargain prices. He stayed there until 1902 then, possibly because of continued negative criticism (notably from Jens Thiis, who wrote that Skramstad had [...] "wasted his talents" [...] on repetitive paintings) he left his family {{and went back to}} Munich to work for a German art dealer. He died there, ten years later.|$|R

60|$|Woot the Wanderer slept {{that night}} in the tin castle of the Emperor of the Winkies and found his tin bed quite comfortable. Early the next morning he rose and took a walk through the gardens, where there were tin fountains and beds of curious tin flowers, and where tin birds perched upon the {{branches}} of tin trees and sang songs that sounded like the notes of tin whistles. All these wonders had been made by the clever Winkie tinsmiths, who wound the birds <b>up</b> <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> so that they would move about and sing.|$|E
6000|$|... "We camped at night," [...] assented the undertaker, [...] "but {{we put in}} {{practically}} the whole day on the water. You see we were after a party that had come up here from the city on his vacation and gone out in a sailing canoe. We were dragging. We were <b>up</b> <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> at sunrise, lit a fire {{on the beach and}} cooked breakfast, and then we'd light our pipes and be off with the net for a whole day. It's a great life," [...] concluded Mr. Gingham wistfully.|$|E
6000|$|... [Picture: Sea-side scene] It is {{the same}} {{when you go to}} the sea-side.

I always get red bathing drawers. I rather fancy myself in red drawers. They suit my complexion so. But when I get to the sea I don’t feel somehow that I want that early morning bathe nearly so much as I did when I was in town.|$|R
50|$|Lam Phương {{was born}} in Vĩnh Thanh Vân village, now a part of Rạch Giá, Kiên Giang Province. In {{the front of his}} house was a river, and across the river was Thập Phương Temple. As a result, his {{childhood}} memories and imagery prominently featured small rowing boats (con đò) ferrying people across the river, the sound of ringing temple bells, and vast rice paddies, which were etched in his mind throughout his life from childhood and later influenced his musical works. As a very young child, he was fascinated by the sound of ringing temple bells, while his neighbors were uncomfortable with the bells waking everyone <b>up</b> early <b>every</b> <b>morning.</b>|$|R

Many nights during Stelle's ninety-nine-day tenure, the mansion was [...] "lit up like a Christmas tree", as thirty to forty guests were often entertained at one time, {{a number of them}} friends from Southern Illinois and Springfield. It will be noted, this specific extravagance, involved no overspending, as the entertainment budget had scarcely been touched during Horner's long illness. As well, Stelle was <b>up</b> early <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> as habit, choosing to partake of breakfast in the company of the servants.|$|R
