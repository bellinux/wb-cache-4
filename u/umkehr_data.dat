40|$|This report {{describes}} work {{to improve}} the quality of total ozone and <b>Umkehr</b> <b>data</b> obtained in the past at the NOAA Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory and the Dobson spectrophotometer ozone observatories. The authors present results of total ozone data re-evaluations for ten stations: Byrd, Antarctica; Fairbanks, Alaska; Hallett, Antarctica; Huancayo, Peru; Haute Provence, France; Lauder, New Zealand; Perth, Australia; Poker Flat, Alaska; Puerto Montt, Chile; and South Pole, Antarctica. The improved data will be submitted in early 1996 to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) World Ozone Data Center (WODC), and the Atmospheric Environment Service for archiving.

40|$|Until recently, <b>Umkehr</b> <b>data</b> {{taken by}} 20 Dobson {{stations}} {{around the world have}} been the principal source of information about the behavior of upper stratospheric ozone. Umkehr results are used also for detecting drifts in satellite instruments and for determining intersatellite biases. However, a systematic evaluation of the quality of <b>Umkehr</b> <b>data</b> taken by the various stations has been lacking. Five years of ozone profile data from the Solar Backscattered Ultraviolet (SBUV) have been used to examine and intercompare the quality of Umkehr stations, and to assess the degradation of their performance after the El Chichon volcano eruption in southern Mexico. In contrast to Umkehr, the SBUV ozone measurments in layers 7 through 9 (1 - 8 mb) were unaffected by the massive amounts of dust and gases ejected by El Chichon...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} of <b>Umkehr</b> ozone profile <b>data</b> with the reprocessed solar backscatter ultraviolet (SBUV) ozone {{data in the}} northern middle-latitude region, 30 deg to 50 deg N, is reported. Although significant biases exist between {{the two types of}} observations, the long-term variations and least squares linear regression trends agree remarkably well over the comparison period of 1979 to 1990. The ozone trend in the upper stratosphere is of the order of - 0. 9 %/yr. Near 25 km, little if any trend appears, but a larger negative trend is seen in the lower stratosphere near 15 km. Comparisons show that the average annual ozone cycles in the profiles also agree well. The upper stratospheric ozone results are consistent with photochemical model predictions of ozone depletion near 40 km that are due to the release of anthropogenically produced chlorofluorocarbons. The lower stratospheric ozone trend results are in reasonable agreement with published ozonesonde data trends. It is shown that the ozone trends in the lower stratospheric layers impact significantly on the total ozone trend of the order of - 0. 47 %/yr. The good agreement now seen between the two types of observations suggest that the combined ground-based and satellite approach could provide a valuable database for long-term monitoring of stratospheric ozone for trends and extraordinary variations...|$|R
40|$|Month-to-month {{variations}} {{evidenced by}} ozone profiles inferred from the classical Umkehr observations {{and from the}} back-scattered ultraviolet (BUV) satellite observations made from the Nimbus 4 satellite are examined. Upper stratospheric ozone profiles derived from BUV and <b>Umkehr</b> <b>data</b> display similar seasonal variations of about the same phase and magnitude for the 38 km to 50 km region. Between 28 km and 38 km, the seasonal variations are less marked, but the same rough picture emerges for both data sets. If both data sets indicate an increasing (or decreasing) trend {{over a period of}} years, {{it is not possible to}} conclude that a trend exists unless separate means exists for monitoring stratospheric dust. Because of the stratosphere well above the Junge layer seems less likely to be affected by volcanic debris, BUV data should be superior to <b>Umkehr</b> <b>data</b> for monitoring trends in the 38 km to 50 km range, provided that the calibration problems of flying such a monitoring instrument in space can be overcome...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} stratospheric {{aerosols}} on Umkehr estimates of long-term ozone depletion associated with chlorofluoromethanes (CFMs) is considered in a statistical time series trend analysis. Time series models are estimated using monthly averages of Umkehr measurements {{made over the}} last 15 to 20 years. The time series regression models incorporate seasonal, trend and noise factors and an additional factor {{to account for the}} effects of atmospheric aerosols on the Umkehr measurements. The analysis indicates a statistically significant relation with atmospheric aerosol transmission in the Umkehr layers and implies that the relation {{is an important factor in}} any time series trend analysis of <b>Umkehr</b> <b>data.</b> Taking this relation into account, statistically significant negative trends were found in the Upper Umkehr layers. It is pointed out that upper stratospheric ozone could be sensitive to long-term solar variability as well as other possible influences in addition to CFM-induced effects, and therefore the cause or causes of the estimated trend cannot be unambiguously estimated using current <b>Umkehr</b> <b>data...</b>|$|E
40|$|Ozone {{vertical}} profile <b>Umkehr</b> <b>data</b> for layers 3 - 9 obtained from 12 stations, using both previous and new inversion algorithms, were analyzed for trends. The trends estimated for the <b>Umkehr</b> <b>data</b> {{from the two}} algorithms were compared using two data periods, 1968 - 1991 and 1977 - 1991. Both nonseasonal and seasonal trend models were fitted. The overall annual trends {{are found to be}} significantly negative, of the order of - 5 % per decade, for layers 7 and 8 using both inversion algorithms. The largest negative trends occur in these layers under the new algorithm, whereas in the previous algorithm the most negative trend occurs in layer 9. The trend estimates, both annual and seasonal, are substantially different between the two algorithms mainly for layers 3, 4, and 9, where trends from the new algorithm data are about 2 % per decade less negative, with less appreciable differences in layers 7 and 8. The trend results from the two data periods are similar, except for layer 3 where trends become more negative, by about - 2 % per decade, for 1977 - 1991...|$|E
40|$|Dobson {{total ozone}} data from 1970 - 1984 and stratospheric Umkehr profile ozone data from 1970 - 1981 are analyzed. The {{relationship}} between ozone and long-term solar cycle activity is examined using 10. 7 cm solar flux data. From the Dobson data {{it is estimated}} that the overall global trend in total ozone is - 0. 26 + or - 0. 92 percent per decade, which indicates no significant overall trend; and for the total ozone-solar flux relationship there is a 1. 18 + or - 0. 66 percent change in total ozone from solar cycle minimum to maximum that reveals a positive relationship. Analysis of the <b>Umkehr</b> <b>data</b> reveals a negative trend of - 0. 30 + or - 0. 17 percent per year in the layers 7 snd 8. The relationship between <b>Umkehr</b> <b>data</b> and solar flux in layers 6 and 7 is 2. 57 + or - 1. 25 percent and 3. 40 + or - 2. 16 percent change from solar cycle minimum to maximum; however, no significant relationship is detected in the higher layers 8 and 9. These estimates are compared with theoretical model calculations. It is noted that the estimated effects of solar cycle activity on total ozone and stratospheric ozone agree with calculations of photochemical models...|$|E
40|$|This {{proposed}} research {{sought to}} use SAGE I and II ozone and aerosol measurements {{to reduce the}} variability in ozone trends, principally, but not exclusively, in layer 8 (40 km) derived from multiple Umkehr stations. Building on our experience with both SAGE and <b>Umkehr</b> <b>data,</b> we proposed to commence {{at the very beginning}} of the Umkehr process (measured radiance ratios) and proceed through the fitting and inversion processes in conjunction with radiative transfer calculations to establish a consistent, reliable time series of Umkehr ozone profiles at a number of stations. We expected to be able to reconcile the present discrepancies between SAGE and Umkehr trends in the upper stratosphere and, in particular, to reduce the variability in trend estimates among mid-latitude Umkehr stations...|$|E
40|$|Total ozone (TO 3) {{and ozone}} {{vertical}} profile (by the Umkehr method) have been measured at Belsk (51. 84 &#x 00 B 0;N, 20. 78 &#x 00 B 0;E), Poland, since March 1963. The monthly mean data are analysed {{for the long-term}} changes in the period 1975 &#x 2013; 1996 and 1997 &#x 2013; 2012, that is, in the increasing and decreasing phases of the ozone-depleting substances (ODS) concentration in the mid-altitude stratosphere over the NH mid-latitudes. Standard explanatory variables are selected for the ozone variability attribution to chemical and dynamical processes. A triad of regression models with various formulae for the trend term is examined to get a synergetic effect. The trend term could be: (1) proportional to ODS, (2) piecewise linear (with the turning points in 1975 &#x 2013; the trend onset and in 1997 &#x 2013; the trend overturning), (3) represented by any smooth curve fitted to the ozone time series having &#x 2018;natural variations&#x 2019; removed. Confirming the results from previous studies on the midlatitudinal ozone, the analyses show a weakening of the TO 3 trend and the statistically significant positive trend in the upper stratospheric region (33 &#x 2013; 43 &#x 2009;km) since 1997. The TO 3 depletion in summer and autumn for the period 1997 &#x 2013; 2012 {{is found in the}} <b>Umkehr</b> <b>data</b> due to the ozone decrease in the lower and mid-stratosphere.

40|$|Improvements to the Umkehr {{ozone profile}} {{retrieval}} algorithm {{have been developed}} and are now being evaluated. The updated algorithm is able to simulate observations more accurately and provides data output that is easier to analyze. Among the new diagnostic capabilities that the updated algorithm provides is the averaging kernel (AK) method. The AK approach allows studying how the algorithm responds when a small perturbation is made in a particular layer of the atmosphere [Rodgers 1976, 1990]. We will use the AK method to define precisely what Umkehr should measure given a set of profiles measured by other platforms. This method allows us to compare trends and offsets in data more accurately {{than it has been}} done in the past. The updated Umkehr retrievals will be validated against SAGE II ozone profiles as well as SSBUV ozone profile data. We will discuss possible reasons for offset between data and differences in derived ozone profile trends. Considerable variability of the ozone profile within the 10 -degree latitude envelope creates noise in the SAGE matching dataset and makes comparisons difficult. To eliminate this problem, the SAGE and <b>Umkehr</b> <b>data</b> had been previously de-seasonalized by subtracting the latitude/season dependent ozone climatology. However, the remaining noise in the ozone residuals was still considerably high for trend analysis and was attributed to longitude variability of SAGE sampling. The new ozone climatology (Labow, NASA) that has longitude dependent ozone variability will be used to minimize contribution of sampling noise in comparisons of satellite and ground station. The comparison of zenith-sky radiances (Umkehr N-value measurements) synthesized for a given set of SAGE profiles will be used to determine whether SAGE-derived N-values agree with the Umkehr-measured N-values. The instrumental effects will be discussed. Both the <b>Umkehr</b> <b>data</b> and SAGE II measurements will be analyzed for their information about ozone variability and loss and recovery rates at the mid- and upper (40 km) levels. The updated long-term Umkehr dataset can be used to provide high quality information for identifying signs of ozone recovery. The long Umkehr historical record can provide additional information for separating the dynamic and chemical mechanisms of depletion, and can help the community better understand climate change effects...|$|E
40|$|A {{retrieval}} {{method was}} developed to estimate the solar backscatter ultraviolet (SBUV) satellite albedo for the ozone profiler wavelengths using ground-based ultraviolet measurements. For the present investigation the Umkehr {{was used as the}} ground-based ultraviolet measurement. Simulated SBUV data and <b>Umkehr</b> <b>data</b> theoretically computed from a priori ozone profiles observed by the SAGE II satellite were used to develop the retrieval algorithm and to test its capability. The test indicated that albedos for the SBUV ozone profiler wavelengths should allow estimates to a precision of +/- 5 percent or better, depending on the accuracy of the ultraviolet measurement. Retrievals using actual Umkehr observations were also performed to provide a preliminary look at the magnitude and annual variation of retrieved albedos. A case study was performed, comparing retrieved albedos with SBUV-measured albedos. The SBUV albedo change was seen to be approximately twice as large as the albedo changes estimated by the Umkehr method. Results of the investigation suggest that the method of estimation may be useful for determining the drift rate of the SBUV calibration...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a {{comparison}} between upper stratospheric ozone concentration profiles in the region between 22 and 1. 4 mbar, as determined from surface-based Umkehr observations and satellite Nimbus 4 BUV observations. The <b>Umkehr</b> <b>data,</b> consisting of monthly averages of observations extending over several years or longer, were obtained at three stations located in the Northern Hemisphere and two in the Southern Hemisphere. The BUV data were obtained during the period from May 1970 to March 1971. Aside from some bias in the magnitudes of the Umkehr and BUV data, marked annual cycles of ozone concentration in the upper stratosphere are clearly revealed. Above 4 mbar the profiles show a summer minimum and a winter maximum, while below 4 mbar the annual variation is reversed from this pattern. In the Northern Hemisphere the winter maximum is accompanied by a secondary minimum of 1 - to 2 -month duration near 3 mbar. This short-term minimum is much less obvious in the Southern Hemisphere data. Some of the problem of attempting to monitor long-term changes in the upper stratosphere are discussed briefly...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{coherence}} of stratospheric ozone time series retrieved from various observational records is investigated at Haute-Provence Observatory (OHP- 43. 93 ° N, 5. 71 ° E). The analysis is accomplished through the intercomparison of collocated ozone measurements of Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) with Solar Backscatter UltraViolet(/ 2) (SBUV(/ 2)), Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II (SAGE II), Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE), Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) and Aura and Global Ozone Monitoring by Occultation of Stars (GOMOS) satellite observations {{as well as}} with in-situ ozonesondes and ground-based Umkehr measurements performed at OHP.

40|$|In this work, we {{investigate}} {{the issue of}} the turnaround in ozone trends of the recently homogenized Umkehr ozone record of Arosa, Switzerland, which is the longest <b>Umkehr</b> <b>data</b> set, extending from 1956 to date, using different statistical methods. All methods show statistically significant negative ozone trends from 1970 to 1995 in the upper stratosphere (above 32. 6 km) throughout {{the course of the year}} as well as in the lower stratosphere (below 23. 5 km) mainly during winter to spring, which can be partially attributed to dynamical changes. Over the recent period (19962004) the year-round trends in the lower stratosphere become positive and are more positive during the winter to spring period. The results also show changes in upper stratospheric ozone trends after 1996, which are, however, not statistically significant at 95 % if aerosol correction is applied on the retrieved data. This lack of significant trend changes during the recent period in the upper stratosphere is regionally coherent with recent results derived from upper stratospheric ozone data recorded by lidars, microwave radiometers, and satellite instruments at an adjacent location. Although the positive change in trends after 1996 both for upper and lower stratospheric ozone is in line with the reduction of the emissions of ozone-depleting substances from the successful implementation of the Montreal Protocol and its amendments, we recommend, because of lack of significance for the upper stratospheric trends, repeating this analysis in a few years in order to overcome ambiguous results for documentation of the turnaround of upper stratospheric ozone...|$|E

40|$|Since mid-to late 1980 s {{decreasing}} {{amounts of}} ozone concentration {{has been observed}} in northern mid-latitudes mainly due to the ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbon loading in the stratosphere. Recent works indicate the stabilization of ozone loss in the mid-latitudes, in the upper stratosphere in particular. In order to further investigate the evolution of ozone in the mid-latitudes, a coherent dataset is required. As a first step, we diagnose the long term evolution of ozone at Observatoire de Haute Provence (OHP - 43. 93 °N, 5. 71 °E), one of the northern mid-latitude stations. In this study, we present the inter comparison of ozone measurements from OHP LIDAR with collocated SBUV, SAGEII, HALOE, MLS and GOMOS satellite observations {{as well as the}} ground based Ozonesondes and Umkehr measurements.

Vertical ozone profiles measured in Dobson units (DU) are currently retrieved based on laboratory measurements of the ozone absorption cross-section spectrum between 270 and 400 nm published in 1985 by Bass and Paur (BP). Recently, the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the European Space Agency (ESA) proposed using the set of ozone cross-section measurements made at the Daumont laboratory in 1992 (BDM) for revising the Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) satellite ozone profiles and total ozone column retrievals. Dobson Umkehr zenith sky data have been collected by NOAA ground-based stations at Boulder, CO (BDR) and Mauna Loa Observatory, HI (MLO) since the 1980 s.

It is currently used for all Dobson <b>Umkehr</b> <b>data</b> processing submitted to the World Ozone and Ultraviolet radiation Data Centre (WOUDC) under the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) program of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).

40|$|In {{the upper}} {{stratosphere}} the inter-annual variability of ozone is mostly controlled by chemical reactions and is {{strongly influenced by}} the anthropogenic ozone-depleting substances (ODS). While at middle latitudes the ODS reached the maximum in the stratosphere {{by the end of}} 1990 s, at high latitudes the turning in the growth rate of the ODS has been delayed by several years. Analysis of Umkehr observations helps to understand the influence of the ODS on ozone in the middle and upper stratosphere. We investigated the long-term trend in the upper stratospheric ozone over the Antarctic using re-processed <b>Umkehr</b> <b>data</b> at Syowa station (69. 0 S, 39. 5 E). The long-term variability and trend observed in Umkehr ozone profile data is in good agreement with the station’s overpass subset of the SBUV V 8. 6 Merged Ozone Dataset. The long-term trend is affected by the changes in the polar vortex position and its persistence relative to the geophysical location of Syowa station. We have found a high correlation between the Equivalent Latitude (EqLat) at 850 K (10 hPa or 32 km) and stratospheric ozone. The Southern Hemisphere Annular Mode (SAM) is also considered as one of the explanatory parameters in our analysis of ozone variability over Syowa. High correlation is found between stratospheric ozone and SAM during high solar activity years (HS, 1978 - 1982, 1988 - 1992, and 1998 - 2002). The largest variability in the Antarctic stratosphere related to the SAM signal is observed from September to December. Since the SAM and upper stratospheric ozone are both affected by planetary wave propagation, their correlation reflects their response to the same mechanism, especially during HS.

40|$|We have {{produced}} a profile merged ozone data set (MOD) based on the SBUV/SBUV 2 series of nadir-viewing satellite backscatter instruments, covering the period from November 1978 - December 2003. In 2004, data from the Nimbus 7 SBUV and NOAA 9, ll, and 16 SBUV/ 2 instruments were reprocessed using the Version 8 (V 8) algorithm and most recent calibrations. More recently, data from the Nimbus 4 BUT instrument, which was operational from 1970 - 1977, were also reprocessed using the V 8 algorithm. As part of the V 8 profile calibration, the Nimbus 7 and NOAA 9 (1993 - 1997 only) instrument calibrations have been adjusted to match the NOAA 11 calibration, which was established based on comparisons with SSBUV shuttle flight data. Differences between NOAA 11, Nimbus 7 and NOAA 9 profile zonal means are within plus or minus 5 % at all levels when averaged over the respective periods of data overlap. NOAA 16 SBUV/ 2 data have insufficient overlap with NOAA 11, so its calibration is based on pre-flight information. Mean differences over 4 months of overlap are within plus or minus 7 %. Given the level of agreement between the data sets, we simply average the ozone values during periods of instrument overlap to produce the MOD profile data set. Initial comparisons of coincident matches of N 4 BUV and Arosa <b>Umkehr</b> <b>data</b> show mean differences of 0. 5 (0. 5) % at 30 km; 7. 5 (0. 5) % at 35 km; and 11 (0. 7) % at 40 km, where the number in parentheses is the standard error of the mean. In this study, we use the MOD profile data set (1978 - 2003) to estimate the change in profile ozone due to changing stratospheric chlorine levels. We use a standard linear regression model with proxies for the seasonal cycle, solar cycle, QBO, and ozone trend. To account for the non-linearity of stratospheric chlorine levels since the late 1990 s, we use a time series of Effective Chlorine, defined as the global average of Chlorine + 50 * Bromine at 1 hPa, as the trend proxy. The Effective Chlorine data are taken from the 3 -D Goddard CTM. We will show the latest trend results using this statistical model. In addition, the Nimbus 4 BUV data offer an opportunity to test the physical properties of our statistical model. From ground-based comparisons we will establish an uncertainty range for the Nimbus 4 data. We then extrapolate our statistical model fit backwards in time and compare to the Nimbus 4 data. We compare {{the characteristics of the}} residual, defined as the difference between the data and statistical regression fit, during the Nimbus 4 time period and the 1978 - 2003 period over which the statistical model coefficients were estimated, and present these results...|$|E
