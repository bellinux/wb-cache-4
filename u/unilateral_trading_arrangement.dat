This paper describes the proliferation of these PTAs, discusses their characteristics and implementation, and assesses their potential effects. Realizing the potential gains from Asia-Pacific PTAs requires a commitment to liberalize sensitive sectors, to maintain consistent provisions, and to enforce agreements.

The results are useful to policymakers because new intra-European trade agreements are being negotiated. In the absence of a further expansion of the European Union, estimates of alternative policies may help to clarify the policy debate. The paper also illustrates that the performance of individual countries under the trade agreements can be explained in terms of their macroeconomic environment.

40|$|Some {{developed}} countries have used <b>unilateral</b> <b>trade</b> sanctions against governments that have allegedly {{been engaged in}} gross {{violations of human rights}} as a tool to force such governments to comply with basic human rights standards. Even though <b>unilateral</b> <b>trade</b> sanctions might be targeted against governments that grossly violate human rights, such measures have unintended consequences on the general population who live in the target country. In many cases, the general population suffers as a result of such sanctions rather than the public officials who are the targets. Hence, the effectiveness of such measures in meeting the desired result is questionable. Such measures have been utilized by countries that are members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) thereby raising the issue of the legality of such measures under the WTO rules. The two main issues that surround <b>unilateral</b> <b>trade</b> sanctions are thus the legality of such measures under the WTO rules and the effectiveness of the measures to meet the desired result.

We find that improved access to partner markets and reduction of the external tariff explain virtually all of the welfare gain.

The freeing of trade multilaterally and unilaterally and the formation of regional <b>trading</b> <b>arrangements</b> have all played a part in greater global integration. Global and regional integration have changed the nature of the international markets in which we trade and require corporations to change their production and marketing strategies.

40|$|Reduction in tariff rates {{has been}} one of the major {{developments}} in international trade.

Hence, the Bogor goal of free and open trade and investment lead to APEC member countries to bring trade liberalization to the fore. While APEC has continuously stressed voluntary liberalization efforts, it is expected that countries will undertake these, given positive results on cost and benefit analysis. Hence, trade and investment facilitation measures are called for. This paper argues the need to concentrate in strengthening such measures as complementary to the trade liberalization agenda.

40|$|The {{literature}} {{measuring the}} impact of Preferential Trade Agreements (PTA) and WTO membership on trade flows has produced remarkably diverse results. Rose''s (2004) seminal paper reports a range of specifications that show no WTO effects, but Subramanian and Wei (2007) contend {{that he does not}} fully control for multilateral resistance (which could bias WTO estimates). Subramanian and Wei (2007) address multilateral resistance comprehensively to report strong WTO trade effects for industrialized countries but do not account for unobserved bilateral heterogeneity (which could inflate WTO estimates). We unify these two approaches by accounting for both multilateral resistance and unobserved bilateral heterogeneity, while also allowing for individual trade effects of PTAs. WTO effects vanish and remain insignificant throughout once multilateral resistance, unobserved bilateral heterogeneity, and individual PTA effects are introduced. The result is robust to the use of alternative definitions and coding conventions for WTO membership that have been employed by Rose (2004), Tomz et al. (2007), or by Subramanian and Wei''s (2007).

40|$|After lying dormant for two decades, {{regional}} integration {{is on the}} rise. Recent initiatives suggest that the world trading system may be moving toward three trading blocs clustered around Japan, the European Community, and the United States. Some view this development as a move toward a less fragmented world trading system; others, {{as a threat to}} multilateralism. For a typical developing country, the issue is whether to enter into a {{regional integration}} arrangement or to choose <b>unilateral</b> <b>trade</b> liberalization. Two questions must be asked: Is a preferential approach likely to enhance economic efficiency? And are substantial benefits attainable more easily through regionalism or through <b>unilateral</b> <b>trade</b> liberalization? The authors address these issues first by reviewing past and recent regional integration arrangements. They note that recent arrangements are occurring in a more liberal trading environment than those in the past, and that developing countries are now seeking integration with developed country partners (for example, Mexico and the United States). So the context is different from past arrangements, when regional integration was viewed as an extension of import-substitution industrialization at the regional level. In a discussion of the welfare economics of preferential <b>trading</b> <b>arrangements,</b> they show that a preferential approach to trade liberalization may not increase welfare. For a small country, <b>unilateral</b> <b>trade</b> liberalization will be superior to a preferential approach unless the world divides into trading blocs with mutually high barriers - in which case, a preferential approach ensures market access. In a discussion of the welfare economics of trading blocs, they note that the move to a few trading blocs may make a cooperative solution more likely - at the same time increasing the rewards of noncooperative behavior if bargaining fails. With an empirical evaluation, the authors show that - after controlling for differences in investment - countries that integrated grew no faster than their comparator group. But human capital contributes significantly to growth, suggesting benefits from regional integration arrangements that emphasize cooperation. And there is evidence of catch-up, suggesting benefits for the least-developed members of the new wave of arrangements that emphasize North-South membership. In short, regional integration arrangements {{are more likely to be}} a stepping stone toward a freer world trading system if GATT rules are strengthened, and if developing countries enter into arrangements with developed rather than other developing countries.

40|$|The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 has {{resulted}} in the GATT Contracting States making a renewed commitment to freer global trade and trade liberalisation. These Contracting States signalled their commitment to GATT policies and principles by undertaking to abolish all those non-tariff barriers which were not converted to tariffs and to decrease all tariffs applied by their domestic economies. The movement away from protectionism is intended to bring contracting states in line with the GATT most-favoured-nation and national treatment principles. The only exceptions to these principles are the regional <b>trade</b> <b>arrangements</b> which can be implemented in accordance with Article XXIV of GATT 1947 and the Understanding on the Implementation of Article XXIV of GATT 1947. Regional <b>trade</b> <b>arrangements</b> such as customs unions and free-trade areas have been allowed by the GATT as they are deemed to promote trade liberalisation through the removal of substantially all trade restrictions between countries party to these <b>trade</b> <b>arrangements.</b> In practice this has not been the case, however, as these regional <b>trade</b> <b>arrangements</b> have been known to apply very protectionist trade policies. This research determines whether regional <b>trade</b> <b>arrangements</b> are inherently protective ie does the nature of these regional <b>trade</b> <b>arrangements</b> encourage protectionism? The external trade policies of the European Union (EU), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) are analysed to determine whether the contracting parties to regional <b>trade</b> <b>arrangements</b> have corrupted the GATT provisions and so contributed towards the protectionist nature of these regional <b>trade</b> <b>arrangements.</b> The internal <b>trade</b> provisions relating to the implementation of these regional <b>trade</b> <b>arrangements</b> have also been discussed to determine their compliance with Article XXIV of GATT 1947. As all the selected regional <b>trade</b> <b>arrangements</b> have direct or indirect links to South Africa, the implications of the policies chosen by these parties for South Africa have also been discussed. Analysis of the EU, SADC, SACU and ASEAN has shown that prior to the adoption of the GATT 1994, the free-trade areas and customs unions were not implemented in accordance with Article XXIV provisions. These regional <b>trade</b> <b>arrangements</b> have been moulded to fit the economic aspirations of the relevant contracting states. Of the regional <b>trade</b> <b>arrangements</b> accepted by the GATT, free-trade areas {{have been found to be}} the least protectionist and are the least likely to be perverted by contracting parties. Customs unions, on the other hand, may encourage contracting parties to protect their economies as they rely on group participation rather than individual participation. Individual Member States become responsible to the group which provides these states with greater economic power. As a result Member States are motivated to protect the new group entity from outside competition. In this way, they are inherently protective. Safeguards are therefore necessary to protect individual non-Member States from such behaviour. The implications of protectionism for South Africa, SADC and SACU have also been discussed...|$|R

The principal conclusions are: 1) Countries excluded from a preferential <b>trade</b> <b>arrangement</b> almost always lose. 2) Market access is a key determinant of the net benefits of a preferential <b>trade</b> <b>arrangement.</b> 3) With a free trade agreement (FTA) the external tariff can be lowered such that a poor FTA becomes attractive. 4) For Southern countries, North-South agreements offer a beneficial increase in competition in their home markets, and involve little increase in the supply price of Northern country sales in Southern countries. 5) Multilateral trade liberalization results in significantly larger gains to the world than the network of regional arrangements. 6) For individual countries without high protection,"additive regionalism"will likely result in substantially larger gains than <b>unilateral</b> <b>trade</b> liberalization. 7) Tax replacement requirements reduce the set of desirable regional <b>arrangements.</b> 8) <b>Trade</b> taxes are often an inefficient source of tax revenue. 9) Trade liberalization should be expected to be pro-poor in developing countries, but results will be diverse at the household level so safety nets are important. 10) Dynamic effects to reverse conclusions regarding regionalism are not expected.

40|$|Regional {{integration}} {{initiatives have}} surged in Latin America while many countries have undertaken <b>unilateral</b> <b>trade</b> liberalization, and external market access prospects have improved with the successful {{conclusion of the}} Uruguay Round. The author examines the choices faced by one such country: Bolivia. To the extent that different regional trade agreements follow World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, they could increase market access and allow the countries to realize gains that unilateral liberalization might not have given them. In this sense, regional <b>trade</b> <b>arrangement</b> is not inconsistent with multilateral free trade based on the most-favored-nation (MFN) principle. Estimating export demands using ordinary least squares for different markets {{as well as an}} error correction model, constructing a trade compatibility index, and recognizing the presence of contraband trade, the author examines Bolivia's four main options for regional integration and ranks them as follows: 1) MFN-based trade combined with a regional agreement that gives it preferential access to Mercosur (GATT-plus trade); 2) Joining Mercosur and maintaining duty-free access to the Andean Group; 3) Remaining within the Andean Group and receiving additional market-access concessions from Mercosur; and 4) Remaining within the Andean Group and maintaining existing bilateral <b>trading</b> <b>arrangements.</b> These rankings reflect relative trade access to different markets, assuming stability of demand functions and trade and production patterns. In the final analysis, regional integration is not merely a matter of economics, but is related to domestic and regional politics - and those who gain from different choices will support those choices. MFN trade would elicit neither strong opposition nor strong support, as its benefits and costs are more symmetrically distributed than trade associated with increased regional integration.

40|$|As {{revealed}} by the trade intensity indices, India and the People’s Republic of China have significant bilateral trade potential, which remains unexplored until now. These countries are presently negotiating for free <b>trade</b> <b>arrangements</b> among them based on their complementarities. This paper makes an attempt to estimate the likely benefits in terms of gains or losses in imports of both India and China due to different preferential <b>trading</b> <b>arrangements</b> and free <b>trade</b> <b>arrangements</b> using the gravity model. Empirical results show that {{in the short run}} India’s potential gain is relatively less compared to China because of its high tariffs but in the long run, India’s gains are higher than China once its tariff levels are brought at par with them. Free <b>trade</b> <b>arrangement</b> is a win-win situation for both countries and is consistent with their growing dominance in the international trade.

40|$|Is {{the recent}} {{proliferation}} of Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) in Asia a healthy development, or {{runs the risk}} of turning into an unmanageable "noodle bowl" in the future? The goal {{of this paper is to}} shed some light on this question. The results show that membership in the Asian RTAs considered in this study have not, to date, occurred at the expense of trade with nonmembers, as most Asian countries'' integration with the global economy preceded regional integration. However, looking forward, given their discriminatory nature, a proliferation of RTAs, which is not accompanied by continuing unilateral and multilateral liberalization, could run the risk of leading to costly trade diversion.
