These mandatory reports must {{also include a}} Unique Transaction Identifier (UTI), legal entity identifier (LEI), information on the trading capacity of the counterparty, and the marked-to-market valuation of the position. The counterparty data in a report includes 26 fields for data and the common data includes 59 fields of data. These fields include an LEI, or a unique 20 digit alphanumeric code {{that may be used}} for eight of the 26 counterparty data fields, and the <b>unique</b> <b>trade</b> <b>identifier,</b> which are generated based on the report's LEI.|$|E

40|$|A new general {{framework}} for constructing the best trading strategy {{for a given}} historical indicator is introduced in this paper. We construct the <b>unique</b> <b>trading</b> strategy with the highest expected return. This optimal strategy may be imple-mented directly, or its expected return {{may be used as}} a benchmark to evaluate how far away other proposed strategies for the given indicators are from the opti-mal. Separately, we also construct the <b>unique</b> <b>trading</b> strategy with the highest information ratio. In the normal case, when the traded security return is near zero, and for reasonable correlations, the performance differences are economically insignificant. However, when the correlation approaches 1, the trading strategy with the highest expected return approaches its maximum information ratio of 1. 32, while the trading strategy with the highest information ratio goes to infinity. ...|$|R

The national identifier consisted of a [...] "CANADA" [...] flash stitched on the upper shoulder just below the sleeve seam, and unit or <b>trade</b> <b>identifiers</b> were worn on slip-ons on the shirt's epaulets; however, personnel belonging to Canadian Forces Europe and other overseas missions wore full-colour Canadian flag patches on the upper sleeve. In the 1990s, the [...] "CANADA" [...] flash was replaced with a subdued olive-drab Canadian flag, worn on the upper left sleeve below the epaulet.

The Bambara integrated Maraka communities into their state structure, and Maraka trading posts and plantations multiplied in the Segu based state and its Kaarta vassals in the 18th and early 19th centuries. When the pagan Bambara empire was defeated by the Maraka's fellow Muslim Umar Tall in the 1850s, the Maraka's <b>unique</b> <b>trade</b> and landholdings concessions suffered damage from which they never recovered.|$|R

The Port Authority also administers a Foreign Trade Zone, an area physically located in the United States, but considered outside the jurisdiction of U.S. Customs duties. Because of the zone's <b>unique</b> <b>trade</b> designation, goods can be stored, exhibited, repackaged, manipulated, manufactured, or mixed with other foreign/domestic merchandise within the zone — duty-free. Duty is paid only when goods are moved out of the FTZ into the United States.|$|R

30|$|The {{fact that}} banks’ {{behavior}} {{is characterized by}} heavy-tailed distributions of duration and interval time might imply that banks are social. Another property that reinforces the social aspect of banks {{is found in the}} growth rate of aggregate degree K(t), denoted by the average cumulative number of <b>unique</b> <b>trading</b> partners up to time t [37, 47]. The normalized aggregate degree, defined by K(t)/K(T), grows sublinearly in time (Fig.  2 (d)), meaning that the rate at which banks find a new partner tends to decrease over time. Note that such sublinear growth patterns have been reported for the mobility pattern of mobile-phone users [47] and for contact networks of human individuals formed via face-to-face interactions [37].|$|R

She remembered watching her grandmother make them decades earlier and utilized this memory to reintroduce the ancestral methodology of basket weaving to the Chehalis people once again. Though it had nearly been forgotten, Pete reinvigorated Chehalis artistry by opening an art studio and workshop in her own house. She went on to create the Hazel Pete Institute of Chehalis Basketry through which she taught her children and grandchildren her <b>unique</b> <b>trade.</b> Her business was so successful that it assisted in paying college tuition for many of her relatives (Collins 2001, p. 25).|$|R
50|$|Bazaars (English marketplace, Turkish pazar, Serbian базар, Albanian çarshia) were <b>unique</b> <b>trading</b> {{complexes}} {{developed in}} the towns of Kosovo {{and elsewhere in the}} Balkans, while the area came under the Ottoman Empire. They were built during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries, reaching their final shape in the 19th century. These traditional complexes were developed in two types: the Covered Bazaar or Bezistan and the Open Bazaar. While the first was a closed complex of stores, the second was characterized by consecutive rows of crafts shops, where on Tuesdays merchants exposed their products. Before their construction, people used to expose their crafts on the mosque walls, at the time being practiced only in Albanian towns.|$|R

Using <b>unique</b> <b>trade</b> flows data, we also find a large home bias in Spanish intranational trade. However, we show that this home bias disappears once we {{take into account the}} higher density of social and business networks within regions than between regions. We also find that the home bias does not disappear if intranational trade flows are measured in quantity rather than value. This fact might explain why previous studies on other European countries still find an intranational home bias, even when network effects are taken into account. home bias, state borders, intranational trade, networks, business groups, Spain...|$|R

Investors are positive feedback traders on the buyside and contrarians on the sellside. Domestic investors exhibit more feedback and contrarian behavior than foreign investors, suggesting that foreign investors are more informed on the buyside and less informed on the sellside. Individuals are more feedback and contrarian traders than institutions. Foreign institutional investor sales do not precede, coincide with, or lead to significant returns. Trades do {{not lead to}} price momentum or reversals, but leave a permanent positive price effect.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{limit order}} quotes and trading activity are studied using {{a unique and}} rich database that includes the identity of market participants from a fully automated derivatives market. The analysis is performed using transactions records for three aggregated trader types and three <b>trade</b> <b>identifiers,</b> with <b>trades</b> stamped in milliseconds for the SXF, the equity futures contract of the Montreal Exchange. The <b>identifiers</b> distinguish <b>trades</b> between principals; agency based trades, as well as transactions that are conducted for risk management as opposed to speculative purposes. Agency related trades are shown to represent the largest amount of trading activity relative to other account types. Over 90 % of trades in this electronic market are limit orders. The limit order book, especially the depth 1 order, has a dominant role in providing liquidity and in explaining market participants’ trading behaviour. Participants in the SXF reference their trades to the best limit order depth. Hence, investors with large positions or investors who {{want to build a}} large position have to strategically split large orders to close/build their position, according to the depth of the best limit order, to ameliorate price impact and information leakage effects. In addition, the results show that traditionally measured spreads have no relationship with trading costs. Limit Orders, Trading Activity, Transactions Costs, Electronic Trading...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDevelopment being {{critically}} {{dependent upon}} the import of crude oil, India entered into regional trade agreements with West Asian states, particularly Iran. India signed RTA with Iran because its terms of trade seemed advantageous to others. Besides, a curious trend was observed that a rising GDP was related to a growing total trade growth rate between India- Iran. At present, India's fallen GDP coincides with India's reduced oil import from Iran. Due to the Iranian nuclear crisis, India has been under immense external pressure to halt oil trade Iran which can, consequently, stifle development. India's response has revealed its <b>unique</b> <b>trade</b> diplomacy-‘inclusive alignment’, especially useful in troubled political climes. Inclusive alignment refers to alignment to both powers. Thereby, it does not commit oneself to a singular bloc. Thereby, one could maintain one's neutrality and balance against the US-led sanctions against Iran, and continue Iranian oil imports...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} problem of the {{execution}} of a moderate size order in an illiquid market within the framework of a solvable Markovian model. We suppose that in order to avoid impact costs, a trader decides to execute her order through a <b>unique</b> <b>trade,</b> waiting for enough liquidity to accumulate at the best quote. We find that despite the absence of a proper price impact, such trader faces an execution cost arising from a non-vanishing correlation among volume at the best quotes and price changes. We characterize analytically the statistics of the execution time and its cost by mapping the problem to the simpler one of calculating a set of first-passage probabilities on a semi-infinite strip. We finally argue that price impact cannot be completely avoided by conditioning the execution of an order to a more favorable liquidity scenario. Comment: 28 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
