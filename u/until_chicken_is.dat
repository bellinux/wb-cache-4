40|$|ABSTRACT Cellular {{growth of}} the {{abdominal}} fat pads from Tegel TM 70 white broiler <b>chickens</b> <b>was</b> characterized by both hyperplasia and hypertrophy of adipose cells <b>until</b> the <b>chickens</b> <b>were</b> approximately 14 weeks old, after which hypertrophy of existing adipose cells was solely responsible for increases in the mass of these fat deposits. The percent body fat was linearly and positively correlated {{with the weight of}} abdominal fat. However, at a constant percent body fat, male birds had a larger deposit of fat in the abdominal region than did females. Thus, a different relationship to predict body fat would be required for each sex. In mature birds the mass of an adipose tissue deposit is generally reflected in the size of adipose cells rather than the number of cells in an adipose organ. (Key words. - adipose cells, hypertrophy, hyperplasia, adiposity, abdominal fat pad, chickens...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} evaluate the effects of different levels of sunflower meal (SFM) and the supplementation of a multienzyme complex in the initial diets of broilers on their performance, intestinal morphometry and carcass characteristics. In all, 1100 1 - d - old male chicks were distributed in a completely randomized design with 2 x 5 factorial arrangement (with and without a multienzyme supplement and five levels of SFM inclusion - 0, 4, 8, 12 and 16 %), and five replications per experimental unit. The experimental diets <b>were</b> provided <b>until</b> the <b>chickens</b> <b>were</b> 21 - d - old and thereafter all birds received the same diet up to 42 d, {{to evaluate the}} possible residual effects of treatments. The SFM inclusion impaired performance from 1 to 21 d of age and the animals that received SFM during the initial phase, failed {{to recover from the}} negative effects on performance parameters. The multienzyme supplement improved the intestinal morphometry and was more effective than non - supplemented diets on performance, independent of the SFM inclusion level. The carcass and cuts yield of the wings and leg were significantly affected by the multienzyme supplementation. In conclusion, the SFM inclusion impaired performance variables and intestinal morphometry without affecting carcass yield; however, the supplementation of an enzyme complex counteracted the negative performance and intestinal morphometry effects...|$|R
40|$|Male {{chickens}} {{belonging to}} three Italian purebreds – Ermellinata di Rovigo (ER), Robusta lionata (RL) and Robusta maculata (RM) – were studied. All {{the birds were}} reared under the same rearing conditions (from May <b>until</b> autumn). <b>Chickens</b> <b>were</b> reared under infra-red lamps from birth until 4 weeks of age with a 24 L: 0 D photoperiod. Then they were kept outdoor: the photoperiod changed according to the season (from 16 L: 8 D to 12 L: 12 D). At 138 and 168 days of age 20 birds/breed were weighed and then slaughtered. Testicular samples were collected, after evisceration, processed and embedded in paraffine wax. Sections were stained for morphological observations, observed with light microscope, and then classified according to the testis maturation stage. Ermellinata di Rovigo chickens showed the lowest (P< 0. 01) body weight and the highest (P< 0. 01) testes weight; testes maturity was higher (P< 0. 01) in ER than in RL, whereas RM was intermediate. For each genotype testes weight and testes maturity did not significantly differ with aging. Correlations between testes weight and body, comb, and wattles weight, according to the breed, were calculated at 168 days of age. For ER no significant correlation was found, whereas RL showed a significant (P< 0. 01) positive relationship between testes weight and body weight, and sexual secondary characters. Robusta maculata showed a significant correlation between testes weight and comb (P< 0. 01) and wattles weight (P< 0. 10). Our results suggest that under the studied environmental conditions ER showed the highest testes development according to its more precocious achievement of adult body weight, whereas RL was the least precocious purebred...|$|R
