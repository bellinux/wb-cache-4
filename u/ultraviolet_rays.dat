5|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} from the Sun breaks water molecules apart, {{reducing the amount of}} water available to form noctilucent clouds. The radiation is known to vary cyclically with the solar cycle and satellites have been tracking the decrease in brightness of the clouds with the increase of ultraviolet radiation for the last two solar cycles. It has been found that changes in the clouds follow changes in the intensity of <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>rays</b> by about a year, but the reason for this long lag is not yet known.|$|E
5|$|As they {{evolved from}} lunged fish, {{amphibians}} {{had to make}} certain adaptations for living on land, including {{the need to develop}} new means of locomotion. In the water, the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward, but on land, quite different mechanisms were required. Their vertebral columns, limbs, limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding. Terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air. They needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature. They developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment. Their skins were exposed to harmful <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>rays</b> that had previously been absorbed by the water. The skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss.|$|E
5|$|The tuatara has a third {{eye on the}} top of {{its head}} called the parietal eye. It has its own lens, a parietal plug which resembles a cornea, retina with {{rod-like}} structures, and degenerated nerve connection to the brain. The parietal eye is only visible in hatchlings, which have a translucent patch at the top centre of the skull. After four to six months, it becomes covered with opaque scales and pigment. Its purpose is unknown, but it may be useful in absorbing <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>rays</b> to produce vitamin D, as well as to determine light/dark cycles, and help with thermoregulation. Of all extant tetrapods, the parietal eye is most pronounced in the tuatara. It is part of the pineal complex, another part of which is the pineal gland, which in tuatara secretes melatonin at night. Some salamanders have been shown to use their pineal bodies to perceive polarised light, and thus determine the position of the sun, even under cloud cover, aiding navigation.|$|E

40|$|In the {{previous}} papers, {{it was reported}} that the casing with cellophane, the irradiation by infrared and/or <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>ray</b> showed a marked prolongation of shelf-life of 2 ̆ 2 Kamaboko 2 ̆ 2. It was further noticed that when the preservatives were smeared on the surface, the combination of the preservatives and casing was rather inferior to the control group without casing. However, when the preservatives were mixed with the paste, the combination did not show any inferior effect to the control. The present paper deals with a comparison of the effectiveness between preservatives which were mixed with the paste and those which were applied on the surface, and further with the effectiveness of casing with cellophane, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate film and of infrared and/or <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>ray</b> irradiation all over the surface of 2 ̆ 2 Kamaboko 2 ̆ 2. 1. When the preservatives were mixed with the paste, dehydroacetic acid and its sodium salt were effective in prolonging the storage life to six and four days, respectively, in contrast to two days in the control at 26 ℃. However, the preservatives which were smeared on the surface were not effective (See Tables 1 and 2). 2. Among the preservatives which were mixed with the 2 ̆ 2 Kamaboko 2 ̆ 2, butyl p-hydroxybenzoate and o-hydroxybenzamide showed effectiveness to some extent on keeping quality (See Table 3). 3. The casing with polyvinyl alchol film gave rather an inferior result. The combination of the casing with polyvinyl alcohol film and the mixing with preservatives shortened the shelf-life compared to the control (See Table 4). 4. In the case of 2 ̆ 2 Kamaboko 2 ̆ 2 without the casing, irradiation by the infrared ray for short time prevented the growth of bacteria. However, irradiation by <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>ray</b> showed remarkable effect on inhibition of bacterial growth. Irradiation by <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>ray</b> twice daily was slightly more effective than that once daily. The combination of irradiation by <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>ray</b> twice daily and that by infrared ray every other day was effective in prolonging the storage life to five days in contrast to two days in the control without the irradiation (See Table 5, Figs. 1 a, 1 b and 1 c). 5.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) is a white, water {{insoluble}} pigment. It {{is used in}} paints, plastics, foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.

Titanium dioxide can reflect, scatter or absorb <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>ray.</b> Besides Titanium dioxide also modify the properties of fabrics. In previous research, titanium dioxide was applied mainly by padding mangle method. This paper presents an approach to observe the effect of titanium dioxide treatment 100 % cotton knitted (plain jersey) fabric applied by exhaustion method followed by curing and washing. The treated fabrics were then analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and the tensile strength, pH value and absorbency of the treated and untreated fabrics were checked. It is found that titanium dioxide impairs the better hand feel and absorbency (wetting time) of all treated fabrics increased gradually than untreated fabrics.

25|$|Ultraviolet lamps {{are used}} to {{sterilize}} workspaces and tools used in biology laboratories and medical facilities. Commercially available low-pressure mercury-vapor lamps emit about 86% of their radiation at 254 nanometers (nm), with 265nm being the peak germicidal effectiveness curve. UV at these germicidal wavelengths damage a microorganism's DNA so that it cannot reproduce, making it harmless, (even though the organism may not be killed). Since microorganisms can be shielded from <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>rays</b> in small cracks and other shaded areas, these lamps are used only {{as a supplement to}} other sterilization techniques.|$|E

25|$|Ozone in the {{stratosphere}} is mostly produced from short-wave <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>rays</b> between 240 and 160nm. Oxygen starts to absorb weakly at 240nm in the Herzberg bands, {{but most of the}} oxygen is dissociated by absorption in the strong Schumann–Runge bands between 200 and 160nm where ozone does not absorb. While shorter wavelength light, extending to even the X-Ray limit, is energetic enough to dissociate molecular oxygen, there is relatively little of it, and, the strong solar emission at Lyman-alpha, 121nm, falls at a point where molecular oxygen absorption is a minimum.|$|E

25|$|Gas lasers, {{laser diodes}} and {{solid-state}} lasers can be manufactured to emit <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>rays,</b> and lasers are available which {{cover the entire}} UV range.

Another type of high power gas laser is the excimer laser. They are widely used lasers emitting in ultraviolet and vacuum ultraviolet wavelength ranges. Presently, UV argon-fluoride (ArF) excimer lasers operating at 193nm are routinely used in integrated circuit production by photolithography. The current wavelength limit of production of coherent UV is about 126nm, characteristic of the Ar2* excimer laser.|$|E

500|$|Postinflammatory {{hyperpigmentation}} (PIH) {{is usually}} the result of nodular acne lesions. These lesions often leave behind an inflamed darkened mark after the original acne lesion has resolved. This inflammation stimulates specialized pigment-producing skin cells (known as melanocytes) to produce more melanin pigment {{which leads to the}} skin's darkened appearance. People with darker skin color are more frequently affected by this condition. Pigmented scar is a common term used for PIH, but is misleading as it suggests the color change is permanent. Often, PIH can be prevented by avoiding any aggravation of the nodule, and can fade with time. However, untreated PIH can last for months, years, or even be permanent if deeper layers of skin are affected. [...] Even minimal skin exposure to the sun's <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>rays</b> can sustain hyperpigmentation. Daily use of SPF15 or higher sunscreen can minimize such a risk.|$|E
