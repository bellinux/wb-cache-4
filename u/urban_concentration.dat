5|$|Hurricane Juan's maximum {{sustained}} {{wind speed}} at landfall in Nova Scotia was measured at 100mph (155km/h). The <b>urban</b> <b>concentration</b> surrounding Halifax Harbour bore {{the brunt of}} the highest sustained winds and strongest wind gusts during the storm; some unofficial estimates have placed gusts as high as 145mph (230km/h). Wave-rider weather buoys off the entrance of Halifax Harbour snapped their moorings after reportedly recording waves in excess of 65ft (20m). Significant erosion occurred on the populated shores of the harbour, particularly in the Bedford Basin where residential properties and railway tracks received most of the wave action. Storm surges of 5 to 7feet (1.5 to 2m) were reported in the harbour; it was the highest surge ever recorded in Halifax Harbour. Rainfall was fairly light due to the fast movement and dry air on the southern side of the storm. There were no rainfall reports greater than 2inches (52mm).|$|E

40|$|This study {{summarizes}} the key {{findings of a}} long-term (1991 − 2008) monitoring program to measure polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) in urban and rural ambient air in the UK. Air concentrations are reported for 6 sites— 3 urban (London, Manchester, and Middlesbrough) and 3 rural/semirural (Hazelrigg, High Muffles, and Stoke Ferry). Nearly 310 samples have been analyzed, each for a 3 -month period. Annually averaged <b>urban</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the early 1990 s were typically a few 100 s fg (TEQ) m− 3 and < 50 fg m− 3 in the mid- 2000 s. Applying first-order kinetics to the whole urban time series gave T 1 / 2 (atmospheric half-lives) in London and Manchester of 3. 2 − 5. 9 and 4. 1 − 5. 9 years, respectively. Estimated national annual atmospheric emissions trends broadly correlated with the trends in <b>urban</b> ambient <b>concentrations,</b> suggesting that the inventory has captured the broad mixture of sources. However, rural air concentrations (in the low 10 s fg m− 3) show no discernible change since 1996, while recent <b>urban</b> <b>concentrations</b> are close to those in rural areas. Other UK trend data infer the declines in the 1990 s followed previous declines in the 1980 s from peak levels in the 1950 − 1970 s, all before routine monitoring began. Winter concentrations are generally a factor of 2 − 3 higher than summer concentrations, implicating diffuse combustion sources (e. g., domestic space heating). These observations taken together suggest that most major readily controllable primary/point sources were reduced by the early/mid- 1990 s in the UK and that current ambient levels in both rural and urban areas may remain at broadly similar levels in the foreseeable future, unless there are major changes in energy requirements and generation options, fuel usage, and policy drivers...|$|R
