The film also included footage of the space, images of past show posters, and music recorded by bands who had played at the Union Theatre in its heyday. The film takes a non-apologetic look at the <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> of <b>working</b> as a collective, paying bills, working with creative spirits and the space's meaning to the Peterborough Arts community.|$|R

5000|$|Transfer {{students}} tend to be disproportionately from poorer families, according to one report. A report suggests that many transfer students have [...] "far more experience in the <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> of the <b>working</b> world" [...] and tend to bring more diversity to a college campus. A second report confirms that [...] "transfers graduate {{at a higher rate}} than students who just finished 12th grade", and have [...] "adjusted to a more independent lifestyle." [...] Demographic analysis suggests that a slight decline in high school graduates is underway since about 2009, prompting many four-year colleges {{to make up for the}} shortfall by bringing in more transfer students.|$|R
40|$|Working {{with the}} fishing {{industry}} to collect fishery-dependent data for scientific and advisory purposes is essential in most countries, but despite the many advantages of working with fishers, it is not without challenges. The objectives <b>and</b> the <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> of 16 recent projects in Ireland are described, and four case studies are discussed in detail. Some common themes that characterize both successful and unsuccessful experiences are identified. One critical aspect is industry’s sometimes unrealistic time-horizons and expectations when engaging in scientific data collection. Detailed communication of objectives, procedures, results, and relevance not only to industry representatives, but also to vessel owners and crew, is required throughout {{the life cycle of}} a project. For some projects, there is a clear need to include incentives in the design, but for others this is less critical. The critical needs for ongoing quality control and assurance, validation of data, and appropriate project design are discussed, along with the link between successful management systems and participatory research. Finally, comment is provided on how the expected reforms of the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy will place new demands on joint research.

40|$|Psychosocial risk is {{possibly}} {{the single biggest}} cause of occupational ill-health inAustralia, causing up to 30 % of cardiovascular disease in working men <b>and</b> <b>up</b> to 30 % ofdepression in working women. While the number of studies on effective workplaceinterventions has increased significantly in recent years, there has been at best onlylimited analysis examining the context for these interventions. The literature provideslittle evidence with which to answer critical public policy questions. In order to determine how diverse stakeholders are responding to job stress, this studydirectly sought to characterise this context. Through interviews across industry and withkey stakeholders, this study provides a thorough and empirically grounded description ofcurrent Victorian practice, a critical support for developing a systems approach toworkplace stress. The interviews examined the views of Victorian stakeholders in thearea of job stress to investigate understanding of and receptivity to systems approaches and reviewed experiences in workplaces. The picture that emerges from the interview data is contrasting, but with common features across groups. Most parties understood stress as an individual health issue, even though the links to the wider workplace environment were recognised by many. The views of some interviewees imply moral judgements about acceptable stress, experienced by “good” people who deal with trauma and conflict in their work, and unacceptable stress, experienced by “bad” people who can’t cope with the <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> of <b>working</b> life. Even so, the {{need to deal with}} job stress is recognised by all...|$|R
60|$|Dr. May {{and his son}} felt keenly {{and spoke}} strongly. There was so much of sympathy and fellow-feeling between them, {{that there was no}} {{backwardness}} on Norman's part in telling his whole trouble, with more confidence than schoolboys often show towards their fathers, and Dr. May entered into the mortification as if he were still at school. They did not go into the house, but walked long <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the garden, <b>working</b> themselves up into, if possible, stronger indignation, and concerting the explanation for to-morrow, when Dr. May meant to go at once to the head-master, and make him attend to the true version of the story, appealing to Harvey Anderson himself, Larkins, and many others, for witnesses. There could be hardly a doubt that Norman would be thus exculpated; but, if Dr. Hoxton would not see things in their true light, Dr. May was ready to take him away at once, rather than see him suffer injustice.|$|R
