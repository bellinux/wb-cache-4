25|$|The EPA has the {{authority}} to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act, {{and is one of the}} agency's seven priorities.|$|E
25|$|The EPA began {{regulating}} {{greenhouse gases}} (GHGs) from mobile and stationary sources {{of air pollution}} <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act (CAA) {{for the first time}} on January 2, 2011. Standards for mobile sources have been established pursuant to Section 202 of the CAA, and GHGs from stationary sources are controlled under the authority of Part C of Title I of the Act per Regulation of Greenhouse Gases <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act. The BenMAP open-source tool, created by the agency, estimates the health benefits from improvements in air quality.|$|E
25|$|The bill {{exempted}} fluids used in {{the natural}} gas extraction process of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) from protections <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act, Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and CERCLA ("Superfund").|$|E
50|$|DNR {{does not}} issue or enforce {{environmental}} permits <b>under</b> <b>the</b> federal <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act, <b>Clean</b> Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and related laws. Those functions are {{the responsibility of}} the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE).|$|R
50|$|During {{his first}} term as EPA Administrator, William Ruckelshaus spent 60% {{of his time on}} the {{automobile}} industry, whose emissions were to be reduced 90% <b>under</b> <b>the</b> 1970 <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act after senators became frustrated at the industry’s failure to cut emissions under previous, weaker air laws.|$|R
50|$|Violations {{occurring}} over a 4½ year period—from October 1993 to July 1998—targeted American Airlines {{for using}} high-sulfur fuel in motor vehicles at 10 major airports around <b>the</b> country. <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> federal <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act high sulfur fuel {{cannot be used}} in motor vehicles. American Airlines promptly identified and corrected these violations of <b>the</b> <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act.|$|R
25|$|Several {{lawsuits}} {{have been}} filed over global warming. For example, Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency before the Supreme Court of the United States allowed the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act. A similar approach was taken by California Attorney General Bill Lockyer who filed a lawsuit California v. General Motors Corp. to force car manufacturers to reduce vehicles' emissions of carbon dioxide. This lawsuit was found to lack legal merit and was tossed out. A third case, Comer v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc., a class action lawsuit filed by Gerald Maples, a trial attorney in Mississippi, {{in an effort to}} force fossil fuel and chemical companies to pay for damages caused by global warming. Described as a nuisance lawsuit, it was dismissed by District Court. However, the District Court's decision was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which instructed the District Court to reinstate several of the plaintiffs' climate change-related claims on 22 October 2009. The Sierra Club sued the U.S. government over failure to raise automobile fuel efficiency standards, and thereby decrease carbon dioxide emissions.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, the United States made a {{civil claim}} against Chemetco <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act, 42.: [...] "…Chemetco {{will pay a}} civil penalty of $305,267…" [...] Chemetco was also {{required}} to provide injunctive relief [...] "…including installation of a Continuous Particulate Mass Monitor System.|$|E

50|$|One of CARB's {{responsibilities}} is {{to define}} vehicle emissions standards. California {{is the only}} state permitted to issue emissions standards <b>under</b> <b>the</b> federal <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act, subject to a waiver from the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Other states may choose to follow CARB or federal standards but may not set their own.|$|R
50|$|The Commonwealth of Massachusetts was {{required}} <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Federal <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act to mitigate air pollution {{generated by the}} highway improvements. Secretary of Transportation Fred Salvucci {{signed an agreement with}} the Conservation Law Foundation in 1990 enumerating 14 specific projects the state agreed to build. This list was affirmed in a 1992 lawsuit settlement.|$|R
50|$|In the U.S., air emissions, which {{correspond}} to losses for usable liquid commodities and/or salable products, are typically required to undergo air quality permitting <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Federal <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act. Quantification of potential emissions for permitting purposes {{is most often}} accomplished by applying emission equations published in Chapter 7.1 of the U.S. EPA's AP-42: Compilation of Air Emission Factors.|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to federal funds programmed through the Boston MPO, and MBTA capital funds derived from fares, sales tax, municipal assessments, and other minor internal sources, the T receives {{funding from the}} Commonwealth of Massachusetts for certain projects. The state may fund items in the State Implementation Plan (SIP) - such as the Big Dig mitigation projects - which is the plan required <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act to reduce air pollution. ( [...] , all of Massachusetts is designated as a clean air [...] "non-attainment" [...] zone.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{fallout from}} the {{accident}} clouded BP's corporate image because of the mismanagement at the plant. There had been several investigations of the disaster, the most recent being that from the US Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board which [...] "offered a scathing assessment of the company." [...] OSHA found [...] "organizational and safety deficiencies {{at all levels of}} the BP Corporation" [...] and said management failures could be traced from Texas to London. The company pleaded guilty to a felony violation of the Clean Air Act, was fined $50million, the largest ever assessed <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act, and sentenced to three years probation.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{determined}} that the EPA lacked authority <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act (CAA) to regulate {{carbon dioxide and other}} greenhouse gases to address climate change. Twelve US states as well as US territories, major cities, environmental groups, and others petitioned in federal court to overrule the EPA decision. On April 2, 2007 the Supreme Court of the United States in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency said the CAA authorized the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases as air pollutants. In December, 2009 the EPA issued its [...] "Endangerment Finding," [...] which found that greenhouse gases threaten health and welfare. In January, 2011 the EPA implemented permitting for sources of greenhouse gases.|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Pursuant to a congressional request, GAO reviewed the regulatory programs that target specific pollutants or sources of pollution <b>under</b> <b>the</b> 1990 <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act Amendments, focusing on: (1) examples of emission sources subject to regulation under more than one program authorized by the act; and (2) {{the status of the}} Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) efforts to facilitate compliance for such sources. ...|$|R
5000|$|Homer City v. EPA. On April 29, 2014, in EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, the U.S. Supreme Court {{said the}} EPA's Cross-State Air Pollution Rule was a {{cost-effective}} allocation of emission reductions among upwind States {{and is a}} permissible, workable, and equitable interpretation of the Good Neighbor Provision. [...] The Court rejected the argument in Morrisey's brief which claimed that the [...] "EPA exceeded its authority <b>under</b> <b>the</b> federal <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act when it promulgated the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule".|$|R
5000|$|For example, all {{of these}} {{approaches}} {{are used in the}} United States. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (responsible for air quality regulation at a national level <b>under</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act, utilizes performance standards <b>under</b> <b>the</b> New Source Performance Standard (NSPS) program. Technology requirements are set under RACT (Reasonably Available Control Technology), BACT (Best Available Control Technology), and LAER (Lowest Achievable Emission Rate) standards. [...] Flexibility alternatives are implemented in U.S. programs to eliminate acid rain, protect the ozone layer, achieve permitting standards, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.|$|R
2500|$|The bill {{exempted}} fluids used in {{the natural}} gas extraction process of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) from protections <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act, Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and CERCLA. It created a loophole that exempts companies drilling for natural gas from disclosing the chemicals involved in fracking operations that would normally be required under federal clean water laws. See Exemptions for hydraulic fracturing under United States federal law. This exclusion {{has been called the}} [...] "Halliburton Loophole". Halliburton is the world's largest provider of hydraulic fracturing services. The measure was a response to a recommendation from the Energy Task Force, chaired by Vice President Dick Cheney in 2001. (Cheney had been Chairman and CEO of Halliburton from 1995 to 2000.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, the New York State Attorney General's office demanded full {{disclosure}} of [...] "financial risks from greenhouse gases" [...] to the shareholders of electric power companies proposing {{the development of}} IGCC coal-fired power plants. [...] "Any one of the several new or likely regulatory initiatives for CO2 emissions from power plants - including state carbon controls, EPA's regulations <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act, or the enactment of federal global warming legislation - would add a significant cost to carbon-intensive coal generation"; U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton from New York has proposed that this full risk disclosure be required of all publicly traded power companies nationwide. [...] This honest disclosure has begun to reduce investor interest in all types of existing-technology coal-fired power plant development, including IGCC.|$|E
2500|$|The EPA {{completed}} the required study in 1998 {{and concluded that}} regulation of coal and oil-fired power plants was [...] "appropriate and necessary." [...] In 2012, the Agency reaffirmed the [...] "appropriate and necessary" [...] finding and promulgated floor standards, finding that [...] "mercury and other hazardous air pollutants posed risks to {{human health and the}} environment." [...] Although the EPA estimated that regulations would cost power plants $9.6 billion per year, the EPA concluded that [...] "“costs should not be considered” when determining whether power plants should be regulated. A group of non-profit organizations, corporations, and 23 states filed suit to challenge the EPA's refusal to consider costs when regulating power plants, but the United States Circuit Court for District of Columbia upheld the Agency's decision to not consider costs. In 2014, the Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari to resolve {{the question of whether the}} EPA must consider costs when regulating power plants <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act.|$|E

2500|$|In June 2008 Corker {{was among}} the 36 {{senators}} who voted against a cloture motion needed to allow the further progress of the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act, a measure {{to set up a}} [...] "cap-and-trade" [...] framework to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Shortly before, Corker had offered three amendments to the act which focused on returning as much money as possible to American consumers, in part by eliminating free allowances and international offsets. Two years later he supported a proposed Senate resolution to express disapproval of the rule submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency on its endangerment finding identifying greenhouse gases as a matter for regulation <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act. In spring 2011 he was a co-sponsor of the Energy Tax Prevention Act, which would have amended the Clean Air Act to prohibit the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases, and aimed thus to protect households and businesses from paying increased costs passed on to them by businesses compelled to comply with new regulations. Corker said {{at the time that he}} hoped that as an alternative to administrative regulations by the EPA, Congress would [...] "determine a rational energy policy for the country, broadly advancing our energy security and maintaining existing policies to ensure clean air and water.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Arguments over cost, however, cut both ways. For example, the [...] "estimates {{that the}} {{benefits}} of reducing fine particle and ground level ozone pollution <b>under</b> <b>the</b> 1990 <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act amendments will reach approximately $2 trillion in 2020 while saving 230,000 people from early death in that year alone." [...] According to the same report, 2010 alone the reduction of ozone and particulate matter in the atmosphere prevented more than 160,000 cases of premature mortality, 130,000 heart attacks, 13 million lost work days and 1.7 million asthma attacks. Criticisms of EPA's methodologies in reaching these and similar numbers are publicly available.|$|R
40|$|Using {{analytical}} and numerical general equilibrium models, {{we show that}} preexisting factor taxes produce a "tax-interaction effect" that increases the costs of pollution taxes and quotas. Under policies that raise revenue and recycle it through cuts in marginal factor tax rates, this effect is partially offset by a "revenue-recycling effect. " Grandfathered pollution quotas, such as those used <b>under</b> <b>the</b> 1990 <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act Amendments to regulate electric utilities' SO 2 emissions, do not benefit from this offset. Preexisting taxes raise this regulation's cost by over 70 %. More than half of this additional cost could be avoided by auctioning quotas and exploiting the revenue-recycling effect. ...|$|R

JEL Classification: Q 5. Shifts in hog production’s scale and technol-ogy {{over the past several decades}} have led to spatial concentration and thousands of ani-mals per operation. These changes coincide with a heightened interest in hog produc-tion’s contribution to air pollution, namely hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) and ammonia (NH 3). These air pollutants are the source of heated debates in farming communities across the United States, as neighbors of large-scale live-stock operations have raised concerns over environmental and public health effects. The U. S.
