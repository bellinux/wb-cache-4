25|$|PWRs are {{designed}} to be maintained in an <b>undermoderated</b> state, meaning that there is room for increased water volume or density to further increase moderation, because if moderation were near saturation, then a reduction in density of the moderator/coolant could reduce neutron absorption significantly while reducing moderation only slightly, making the void coefficient positive. Also, light water is actually a somewhat stronger moderator of neutrons than heavy water, though heavy water's neutron absorption is much lower. Because of these two facts, light water reactors have a relatively small moderator volume and therefore have compact cores. One next generation design, the supercritical water reactor, is even less moderated. A less moderated neutron energy spectrum does worsen the capture/fission ratio for 235U and especially 239Pu, meaning that more fissile nuclei fail to fission on neutron absorption and instead capture the neutron to become a heavier nonfissile isotope, wasting one or more neutrons and increasing accumulation of heavy transuranic actinides, some of which have long half-lives.|$|E

Da alle Faelle bei Wasserflutung der Hohlraeume untermoderiert sind, ist die durch die Konstruktion festgelegte Begrenzung des Hohlraum-Volumens im Brennstoffbereich wesentlich fuer dieses Ergebnis. Die Rechnungen wurden mit der Monte-Carlo-Version MCNP- 3 B durchgefuehrt. (orig. /HP) The {{condition}} of criticality safety (k_e_f_f< 0. 95) is fulfilled in all considered cases. Since all cases are <b>undermoderated</b> {{in the event}} of cavity flooding, the limit of the cavity volume in the fuel area, fixed by the contruction, is essential for this result.

40|$|Water/fat {{separation}} in {{the presence}} of B 0 field inhomogeneity is a problem of considerable practical importance in MRI. This article describes two complementarymethods for estimating the water/fat images and the field inhomogeneity map from Dixon-type acquisitions. One is based on variable projection (VARPRO) and the other on linear prediction (LP). The VARPRO method is very robust and can be used in low signal-to-noise ratio condi-tions because of its ability to achieve the maximum-likelihood solution. The LP method is computationally more efficient, and is shown to performwell <b>undermoderate</b> levels of noise and field inhomogeneity. These methods have been extended to handle multicoil acquisitions by jointly solving the estimation problem for all the coils. Both methods are analyzed and compared and results from several experiments are included to demonstrat...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{criticality}} experiments with <b>undermoderated</b> (1. 6 water-to-fuel volume ratio) 2. 35 wt% and 4. 31 wt% {sup 235 }U enriched UO{sub 2 } rods in water {{were performed to}} provide data on the reactivity effects of lead and depleted uranium reflecting walls. This data furnishes well defined benchmarks for use in validating calculational techniques employed in analyzing fuel shipping and storage systems having lead or uranium biological shields. For each fuel enrichment, the critical separation between three subcritical fuel clusters was observed to increase as either 77 mm thick depleted uranium or 102 mm thick lead reflecting walls were moved towards the fuel. A maximum critical separation was observed for both the lead and the depleted uranium reflecting walls with a water gap between the fuel clusters and the reflecting walls. For both fuel enrichments, this optimum water gap was about 25 mm for the depleted uranium walls and about lOmm for the lead walls...|$|E
40|$|An {{advanced}} passive neutron counter, the high-efficiency neutron counter (HENC), {{has been}} used to measure plutonium content in 200 -L waste drums. The HENC was designed with the {sup 252 }Cf add-a-source (AS) feature to improve accuracy over a wide range of waste matrix materials. The current implementation allows for passive neutron coincidence counting, AS analysis, and multiplicity analysis. Passive neutron assay of typical waste containers is intrinsically more accurate than active neutron techniques because of the penetrability of the spontaneous fission neutrons originating from within the waste matrix. In addition, the HENC is designed as a slightly <b>undermoderated</b> detector to be less sensitive to low loading of hydrogen-bearing matrices. The following paper considers the applicability of three different nondestructive assay methods for analysis of waste drums and the flagging of possible diversions in waste drums. The {sup 252 }Cf AS method, multiplicity counting, and a bounded-parameter multiplicity analysis are presented with areas of applicability...|$|E
40|$|Fuel {{definitions}} {{listed in}} Section 6. 4 {{are the result}} of grouping the large range of commercial fuel types by core type, number of fuel rods, and key criticality characteristics. These characteristics are primarily associated with the assembly moderator ratio and fuel mass and include pellet diameter, active fuel length, fuel rod diameter and clad thickness, and water rod configuration. Another variable for BWR assemblies is the presence, and thickness, of the channel. Characterization studies are based on the 87 -assembly basket configuration. For assemblies exceeding the USL at the enrichment specified in the studies either, the 82 -assembly basket configuration or reduced maximum enrichments are required. Enrichment limits for the 82 -assembly and 87 -assembly basket configurations are provided in Section 6. 7. 6. Lattice Configuration and Channel Studies BWR fuel assemblies are typically <b>undermoderated</b> in the basket structure (H/U ratio below optimum levels). Therefore, initial criticality analysis extracts from each assembly type the following characteristics.

40|$|The {{dispersion}} {{of the order}} of 12000 pcm in the results of the international criticality fuel dissolver benchmark calculation, exercise OECD/ 19, corresponding to a realistic case defined by BNFL, showed the necessity of analysing the calculational methods used in this case. The APOLLO/PIC method developed to treat this type of problem permits us to propose international reference values. The problem studied here, {{at the request of the}} OECD group of experts on criticality calculations, led us to investigate two supplementary parameters in addltion to the double heterogeneity of the fuel: the reactivity variation as a function of moderation and the effects of the size of the fuel pellets during dissolution. The following conclusions were obtained:. The fast cross-section sets used by the international SCALE package introduces a bias of- 3000 pcm in <b>undermoderated</b> lattices. More generally, the fast and resonance nuclear data in critimli codes are not sufficiently reliable (238 U unresolved resonances in ROLAmS,% 5 U and "U radiative capture above 5 KeY in MONK 4 238 ~ fission in ANISN) [...] geometries with micro-pellets led to an underestimation of reactivity at the end of dissolution of 3000 pcm in certain 1988 Sn calculations; this bias was avoided in th...|$|E
40|$|A new non-fertile, weapons-grade {{plutonium}} oxide fuel concept is developed and evaluated for deep burn applications in a {{boiling water reactor}} environment using the General Electric 8 x 8 Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR) fuel assembly dimensions and pitch. Detailed infinite lattice fuel burnup results and neutronic performance characteristics are given and although preliminary in nature, clearly demonstrate the fuel`s potential as an effective means to expedite the disposition of plutonium in existing light water reactors. The new non-fertile fuel concept is an all oxide composition containing plutonia, zirconia, calcia, and erbia having the following design weight percentages: 8. 3; 80. 4; 9. 7; and 1. 6. This fuel composition in an infinite fuel lattice operating at linear heat generation rates of 6. 0 or 12. 0 kW/ft per rod can remain critical for up to 1, 200 and 600 Effective Full Power Days (EFPD), respectively, and achieve a burnup of 7. 45 {times} 10 {sup 20 } f/cc. These burnups correspond to a 71 [...] 73 % total plutonium isotope destruction and a 91 [...] 94 % destruction of the {sup 239 }Pu isotope for the 0 [...] 40 % moderator steam void condition. Total plutonium destruction greater than 73 % is possible with a fuel management scheme that allows subcritical fuel assemblies {{to be driven by}} adjacent high reactivity assemblies. The fuel exhibits very favorable neutron characteristics from beginning-of-life (BOL) to end-of-life (EOL). Prompt fuel Doppler coefficient of reactivity are negative, with values ranging between {minus} 0. 4 to {minus} 2. 0 pcm/K over the temperature range of 900 to 2, 200 K.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{criticality}} experiments with 2. 35 wt% and 4. 31 wt% {sup 235 }U enriched UO{sub 2 } rods in water {{were performed to}} provide well defined benchmark type data {{on the effects of}} thick steel reflecting walls. For each fuel enrichment. the critical separation between three subcritical fuel clusters was observed to increase as 178. 5 mm thick reflecting walls of reactor grade steel was moved towards the fuel. This increase was observed for fuel clusters having an <b>undermoderated</b> water-to-fuel volume ratio of 1. 6 and for fuel clusters having near optimum neutron moderation (2. 92 for the 2. 35 wt% {sup 235 }U enriched fuel and 3, 88 for the 4. 31 wt% {sup 235 }U enriched fuel). In all cases the critical separation between fuel clusters increased to a maximum as the steel walls were moved towards the fuel clusters. This maximum effect was observed with about 10 mm of water between the fuel clusters and the steel reflecting walls. As this water gap was decreased, the critical separation between the fuel clusters also decreased slightly. Measurement data were also obtained for each enrichment with neutron absorber plates between the fuel clusters having the l. 6 water-to-fuel volume ratio. During these measurements, the steel reflecting walls were at the near optimum distance from the fuel clusters. The fixed neutron absorbers for which data were obtained include 304 -L steel, borated 304 -L steel, copper, copper containing 1 wt% cadmium, cadmium, and two trade name materials containing boron (Boral and Boroflex), A comparison between these data and data from previous experiments indicates a slight reduction in the effectiveness of the absorber plates when the steel reflecting walls are present...|$|E
40|$|Three {{batches of}} PuO/sub 2 / were {{prepared}} via the plutonium peroxide route. Except {{for the high}} tap density, {{it was found that}} the powder characteristics of PuO/sub 2 / prepared in this manner are similar to the characteristics of PuO/sub 2 / prepared by the oxalate route. Modifications were made to equipment for preparation of mixed oxides to achieve better reproducibility and minimize operator time. A study was initiated to assess the feasibility of using gamma spectrometry for rapid in-process determination of plutonium in solutions that also contain uranium. It was found that plutonium can be determined to within 1 % Provided that the uranium concentration is known to better than 2 mg/ml. Plutonium separation studies using TTA extraction were continued and the determination of cesium and strontium fission products by flame photometry was investigated. The effect of carbon content on the weight loss of PuO/sub 2 / during sintering was determined. Metallographic examination of sintered UO/sub 2 / [...] 35 wt% PuO/sub 2 / pellets indicated that the low densities obtained may be due to grain growth and broadening of grain boundaries. Green spheres of PuO/sub 2 / were formed in a small mill jar and the particle size distributions of both the formable and non-formable powder fractions were determined by centrifugal sedimentation size analysis. Preparation of duplex pellets for determining the reaction between PuO/sub 2 / [...] UO/sub 2 / and possible cladding and diluent metals was continued. Pellets of pure PuO/sub 2 / and six compositions of coprecipitated PuO/sub 2 / [...] UO/sub 2 / were fabricated for corrosion testing in water and steam. Preliminary tests in steam at 750 deg F and 2200 psi for 10 hr showed no visual evidence of corrosion. The NUSURP code was modified to allow calculation of <b>undermoderated</b> systems.
