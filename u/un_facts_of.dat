25|$|The <b>UN</b> <b>Fact</b> Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict {{published}} a 575-page report on 15 September 2009, stating it {{had found that}} war crimes were committed by both sides involved in the Gaza War.|$|R
50|$|The <b>UN</b> <b>Fact</b> Finding Mission {{analysed}} {{the police}} institutions in Gaza {{from the time}} Hamas gained control. They concluded that the Gaza police were a civilian law-enforcement agency and that Israel's blanket targeting of the Gaza police was therefore a violation of international humanitarian law.|$|R
50|$|A <b>UN</b> <b>Fact</b> Finding {{mission in}} September 2009 led by South African Judge Richard Goldstone (the Goldstone report) {{concluded}} that the blockade was possibly a crime against humanity, and recommended that the matter be referred to the International Criminal Court if the situation has not improved in six months.|$|R
50|$|Israel {{ended up}} rejecting the resolution, saying {{it did not}} pay {{attention}} to attacks by rocks on Jewish worshippers at the Western Wall. In turn, the UN Security Council unanimously backed UN Security Council Resolution 673 on Oct. 24, 1990 condemning Israeli rejection <b>of</b> the <b>UN</b> <b>fact</b> finding mission.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>UN</b> <b>Fact</b> Finding Mission (Goldstone Mission), however, {{concluded}} in its report: ″While reports {{reviewed by the}} Mission credibly indicate that members of Palestinian armed groups were not always dressed {{in a way that}} distinguished them from civilians, the Mission found no evidence that Palestinian combatants mingled with the civilian population with the intention of shielding themselves from attack.″e ...|$|R
2500|$|Following the postponing of {{the vote}} on the {{resolution}} in UNHRC, the Palestinian National Authority came under heavy criticism for agreeing to defer the draft proposal endorsing all recommendations <b>of</b> the <b>UN</b> <b>Fact</b> Finding Mission. Several Palestinian human rights organizations, condemning the PA's action, issued a statement under the title [...] "Justice Delayed is Justice Denied". Abbas agreed to postpone the vote on the Goldstone report following a confrontational meeting with Yuval Diskin, head of the Israeli Shin Bet security service.|$|R
50|$|Human Rights Watch {{noted in}} the open letter to Ismail Haniyeh that despite his Foreign Ministry stance as part of {{response}} to the Goldstone Report, Palestinian armed groups remain responsible for firing rockets indiscriminately or deliberately at Israeli civilian objects. HRW also noted that Palestinian militants put Palestinian civilians at risk of Israeli counter-attacks by launching rockets from populated areas. The <b>UN</b> <b>fact</b> finding mission stated that the firing of rockets at Israel constituted a deliberate attack against the civilian population and was in violation of international law.|$|R
5000|$|Head <b>of</b> the <b>UN</b> <b>Fact</b> Finding Mission Justice Richard Goldstone {{presented}} {{the report of}} the Mission to the Human Rights Council in Geneva on 29 September 2009, urging the Council and the international community as a whole {{to put an end to}} impunity for violations of international law in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The Goldstone report accepted that white phosphorus is not illegal under international law but did find that the Israelis were [...] "systematically reckless in determining its use in build-up areas". It also called for serious consideration to be given to the banning of its use as an obscurant.|$|R
5000|$|During the {{conflict}} Israel targeted numerous police facilities in Gaza. Many of these attacks {{occurred during the}} first minutes of the operations resulting {{in the deaths of}} 99 policemen and nine other members of the public. The attacks on Police during {{the first day of the}} operation included the bombing of a police cadet graduation ceremony, killing scores of police cadets along with family members who had come to attend the celebration. Police cadets killed in the incident included traffic police and musicians in the police orchestra. [...] The <b>UN</b> <b>fact</b> finding mission established that approximately 240 Gaza policemen were killed by Israeli forces during the course of {{the conflict}} constituting over one sixth of the total Palestinian casualties.|$|R
5000|$|Israel {{carried out}} Operation Cast Lead in December 2008 with the stated aim of {{stopping}} rocket attacks from Hamas militants. It {{led to a}} decrease in Palestinian rocket attacks. The <b>UN</b> <b>Fact</b> Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict concluded that the operation was [...] "a deliberately disproportionate attack designed to punish, humiliate and terrorize a civilian population, radically diminish its local economic capacity both to work and to provide for itself, and to force upon it an ever increasing sense of dependency and vulnerability". The Israeli government's analysis concludes that the report perverts international law to serve a political agenda and sends a [...] "legally unfounded message to states everywhere confronting terrorism that international law has no effective response to offer them".|$|R
50|$|During the Gaza War (2008-09), Palestinian {{militant groups}} fired rockets aimed at {{civilian}} targets which struck {{the cities of}} Ashdod, Beersheba and Gedera. The military wing of Hamas said that after a week from the start, it had managed to fire 302 rockets, {{at an average of}} 44 rockets daily. 102 rockets and 35 mortars were fired by Fatah at Israel. Over 750 rockets and mortars were fired from Gaza into Israel during the conflict wounded 182 civilians, killing 3 people, and causing minor suffering to another 584 people suffering from shock and anxiety. Several rockets landed in schools and one fell close to a kindergarten, all located in residential areas. The <b>UN</b> <b>fact</b> finding mission stated that this constituted a deliberate attack against the civilian population and was unjustifiable in international law.|$|R
2500|$|In his {{statement}} on the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict, Richard Falk, United Nations Special Rapporteur wrote that international humanitarian law applied to Israel [...] "in regard to the obligations of an Occupying Power and in {{the requirements of the}} laws of war." [...] Amnesty International, the World Health Organization, Oxfam, the International Committee of the Red Cross, The United Nations, the United Nations General Assembly, the <b>UN</b> <b>Fact</b> Finding Mission to Gaza, international human rights organizations, US government websites, the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and a significant number of legal commentators (Geoffrey Aronson, Meron Benvenisti, Claude Bruderlein, Sari Bashi and Kenneth Mann, Shane Darcy and John Reynolds, Yoram Dinstein, John Dugard, Marc S. Kaliser, Mustafa Mari, Iain Scobbie, and Yuval Shany maintain that Israel's extensive direct external control over Gaza, and indirect control over the lives of its internal population mean that Gaza remained occupied.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, the Israeli West Bank barrier became {{another subject}} of criticism. It was {{declared}} illegal {{by both the}} General Assembly and the International Court of Justice. The Court found that the portions of the wall beyond the Green Line and the associated regime that had been imposed on the Palestinian inhabitants is illegal. The Court cited illegal interference {{by the government of}} Israel with the Palestinian's national right to self-determination; and land confiscations, house demolitions, the creation of enclaves, and restrictions on movement and access to water, food, education, health care, work, and an adequate standard of living in violation of Israel's obligations under international law. The <b>UN</b> <b>Fact</b> Finding Mission and several UN Rapporteurs subsequently noted that in the movement and access policy there has been a violation of the right not to be discriminated against {{on the basis of race}} or national origin.|$|R

Hamas officials in Gaza demanded Abu Mazen resignation for supporting the postponement {{of the vote}} at the UN Human Rights Council. Mahmoud al-Zahar said that Abbas was guilty of [...] "a very big crime against the Palestinian people" [...] over the PA's conduct at UNHRC.|$|R

5000|$|Justice O'Connor contested the {{majority}} opinion, which held that introducing the <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> a defendant's prior conviction could be unfairly prejudicial. After all, Congress {{had made the}} <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> a prior conviction {{an element of the}} crime of being a felon in possession of a firearm. It therefore intended for a jury trying such a case to hear the <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> the defendant's prior crime.
