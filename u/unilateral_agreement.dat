50|$|The three {{principles}} of self-governance, self-support (i.e., financial independence from foreigners), and self-propagation (i.e., indigenous missionary work) were first articulated by Henry Venn, General Secretary of the Church Missionary Society from 1841-73, and Rufus Anderson, foreign {{secretary of the}} American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. The principles were drafted formally during an 1892 conference in Shanghai of Christian missions reflecting an almost <b>unilateral</b> <b>agreement</b> {{that the future of}} the Chinese church depended on the indigenization of the leadership, and the finding of sufficiently Chinese modes of worship.

In July 1973, the Hong Kong dollar was dragged down against sterling due to the continued devaluation of the US dollar {{as a result of the}} outflow of capital from Hong Kong. In August 1973, Governor Murray MacLehose and Haddon-Cave attempted to end the historic commitment to sterling reserves but the idea was rejected by London.

Promise theory {{defines a}} {{method by which}} static service {{bindings}} are made in a network, but little {{work has been done}} on handling the dynamic case in which bindings must change over time due to both contingencies and changes in policy. We define two new kinds of promises that provide temporal scope for a conditional promise. We show that simple temporally-scoped promises can describe common network behaviors such as leasing and failover, and allow an agent to completely control the sequence of sets of promises to which it commits with another agent, over time. This allows agents to adapt to changing conditions by making short-term bilateral agreements rather than the long-term <b>unilateral</b> <b>agreements</b> provided by previous promise constructions. ...|$|R

In this article, results obtained from a survey designed to elicit attitudes of college students to prenatal testing and gene therapy for human attributes and psychiatric conditions are reported. The eleven hypothetical disease phenotypes included schizophrenia, alcoholism, tendency toward violent behavior, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression requiring medical treatment, obesity, involvement in “dangerous” sports activities, homosexuality, borderline normal IQ (80 – 100), proportional short stature, and inability to detect perfect pitch. Most students supported prenatal genetic testing for psychiatric disorders and behavior that might result in harm to others (i. e., tendency towards violent behavior) and found prenatal genetic testing for human attributes less desirable.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThis thesis examines the Soviet proposal and its ramifications for the United States and the West. The central theme running through each Soviet proposal has been removal of American nuclear guarantees. Preservation of US {{national security interests}} and hence US ability to extend its forward defense would be gravely threatened by such a NWFZ. However, <b>unilateral</b> <b>agreement</b> on a NWFZ is unlikely by the anticipated members of the Nordic NWFZ the US, USSR, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Iceland, Greenland, and Sweden. The US has military installations in Iceland and Greenland and banning of nuclear weapons during wartime is inconceivable. The question then arises as to which nation or groups of nations will dominate and which will acquiesce. Inevitably the debate breaks down to a tug of war between the two superpowers. It is really the politics surrounding the nuclear weapons that {{is the heart of}} the nuclear-free-zone debate. Changing world politics demand that the West develop a unified strategy toward the USSR. Through NATO it must preserve its vital economic political and military objectives in the Northern Flank. Flexible naval forces and strong political and economic ties to the governments of the nations bordering the Baltic are essential.

50|$|Reform of perverse {{subsidies}} is at a propitious time. The {{current economic}} conditions mean governments are forced into fiscal constraints and {{are looking for}} ways to reduce activist roles in their economies. There are two main reform paths: unilateral and multilateral. <b>Unilateral</b> <b>agreements</b> (one country) are less likely to be undertaken for the reasons outlined above, although New Zealand, Russia, Bangladesh and others represent successful examples. Multilateral actions by several countries are more likely to succeed as this reduces competitiveness concerns, but are more complex to implement requiring greater international collaboration through a body such as the WTO. Irrespective of the path, the aim of policymakers should be to: create alternative policies that target the same issue as the original subsidies but better; develop subsidy removal strategies allowing market-discipline to return; introduce 'sunset' provisions that require remaining subsidies to be re-justified periodically; and make perverse subsidies more transparent to taxpayers to alleviate the 'vote-loser' concern.|$|R

40|$|During the 1990 s {{there was}} great {{attention}} and debate in the European Union (EU) and in OECD countries outside the EU {{on the use of}} voluntary agreements to attain environmental and sustainable energy policy goals. At the time {{there was a lot of}} theoretical analysis and discussions on this policy instrument and in particular on its effectiveness and cost efficiency. Before the debate was over, a number of important voluntary agreements to improve energy efficiency or reduce CO 2 emissions were implemented in Europe both at national and European levels. These voluntary agreements cover end-use equipment and appliances (e. g. cars, electric motors, residential appliances, etc.), industrial processes, and industrial energy management policies and practices. The paper classifies and analyses the different types of voluntary agreements aiming at improving energy efficiency in Europe, and reviews voluntary agreements and other initiatives of similar nature (voluntary programmes, unilateral commitments, self-regulation) in industrial sectors in a number of Member States of the European Union. The paper also examines some successful European initiatives of voluntary nature, including <b>unilateral</b> <b>agreements</b> for improved energy efficiency of end-use equipment, such as the European agreement on energy consumption of washing machines, and the European agreement on power consumption in standby mode of televisions and video cassette recorders (VCRs).

The obvious questions are: Should Nigeria liberalize to all countries on all products or opt for a discriminatory approach through <b>unilateral</b> trade <b>agreements?</b> Where do we think Nigeria should be open, and on what issues should they be closed? What should Nigeria’s trade policy be {{in the face of}} globalization’s negative effects and increasing protectionism of developed countries? The paper reviews key issues regarding an appropriate design of trade policy reforms in Nigeria and its validity for Nigeria’s long-run growth using the cointegration approach. The VAR approach was preferred because it overcomes the limitation and ambiguity associated with the regression results (Enders, 1995). Moreover, recent Monte Carlo evidence strongly favors the Johansen Maximum Likelihood method (JML) approach over the Engle-Granger’s (Dejong, 1992) in this regard.

External {{debt burden}} {{has been viewed}} {{as one of the}} key impediments to economic growth and a cause of widespread poverty in the Heavily lndebted Poor Countries (HIPCs). To join efforts of the HIPCs in ï¬ ghting poverty, the international donor community granted substantial debt relief through different initiatives including among others; <b>unilateral</b> bilateral <b>agreements,</b> the Paris Club Agreements, debt buyback schemes, the I-IIPC Initiative and its successor, the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). All these initiatives were expected to increase public spending in social priority sectors and ultimately reduce poverty incidence in the HIPC-s. This study assesses, firstly whether the debt relief has helped to increase Government spending on education and health sectors in Tanzania and, secondly, whether increased ï¬ scal spending on the sectors has translated into improvement in the primary and secondary school enrollments and life expectancy. A system of structural equations is estimated within a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) framework. The ï¬ ndings suggest increases in Government expenditure on education and health through debt relief. Primary and secondary school enrolments improve with increased Government spending on education and health. Institutional quality is found to be signiï¬ cant in determining education spending and educational indicators. However, life expectancy was not found to respond to public Spending, possibly due to the inherent gestation period in health related indicators and quality of data used. Nevertheless, the ï¬ ndings, though based on short-run series, give an insight that in the long-run, the cumulative effects of debt relief can contribute towards successes in the ï¬ ght against poverty and ultimately attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGS) ...|$|R

Method Inflammatory back pain patients (IBP;≥ 3 months,< 3 years) suggestive of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) {{were included in}} the DESIR-cohort. Baseline sacroiliac-joint-radiographs were read by two central readers (modified New York), adjudicated by a third reader in case of disagreement, yielding a positive or a negative result (central-reading). The same radiographs were also read by local radiologists/rheumatologists rated 'normal', 'doubtful sacroiliitis', 'obvious sacroiliitis' or 'SI-joint fusion' (local-reading); positivity defined as: 1) at least unilateral 'obvious sacroiliitis' 2) 'bilateral 'obvious sacroiliitis' or at least <b>unilateral</b> 'fusion''. <b>Agreement</b> and misclassifications between central readers and central-reading versus local-reading were calculated (kappas). Results Interreader agreement between the central readers was moderate (κ= 0. 54); 108 / 688 radiographs (15. 7 %) were adjudicated. According to local-reading (at least unilateral 'obvious sacroiliitis'), 183 / 688 patients (26. 6 %) had sacroiliitis; according to central-reading, 145 / 688 patients (21. 1 %). Agreement between local-reading and central-reading was also moderate (κ= 0. 55); 76 / 183 patients (41. 5 %) with at least unilateral 'obvious sacroiliitis' (positive by local-reading) and 32 / 109 patients (29. 4 %) with 'bilateral 'obvious sacroiliitis' or at least unilateral 'fusion'' (positive by local-reading) were rated 'negative' by central-reading; 38 / 505 patients (7. 5 %) and 68 / 579 (11. 7 %) respectively without sacroiliitis (negative by local-reading) were read 'positive' by central-reading. Conclusion In recent onset IBP-patients, both trained readers and local rheumatologists/radiologists agree only moderately in recognizing radiographic sacroiliitis. A significant proportion of locally recognized ankylosing spondylitis patients is not confirmed by central-reading (false-positive), while a small minority is false-negative, indicating the necessity of re-evaluating the role of radiographic sacroiliitis as diagnostic criterion for axSpA. © 2014 American College of Rheumatology...|$|R

The model covers 18 economic sectors in each of 22 countries/regions {{and is based on}} Version 5. 4 of the GTAP database for 1997 together with specially constructed estimates of services barriers and other data on sectoral employment and numbers of firms. The distinguishing feature of the model is that it incorporates monopolistic competition in the manufacturing and services sectors, including increasing returns and product variety. The modeling focus is on the effects of the bilateral removal of tariffs on agriculture and manufactures and services barriers. Rules of origin and other restrictive measures and the non-trade aspects of the FTAs are not taken into account due to data constraints. The computational results indicate that the benefits of bilateral FTAs for the United States and partner countries are rather small in both absolute and relative terms, and that far greater benefits could be realized if the United States and its FTA partners adopted unilateral free trade and especially if multilateral free trade was adopted by all countries/regions in the global trading system.

On the other hand, it is considered that industrialization which involves the commercial aspect is able to maintain, and even enhance sports actors 2 ̆ 7 professionalism/performance. In practice, such correlation is not always directly proportional, but inversely proportional. There have been cases of issues related to sports actors 2 ̆ 7 welfare not being properly fulfilled, in fact, being far below the general manpower standards applicable to people doing work (workers/laborers). In general such cases include late or non-payment of wages, reducing bonuses, implementation of contract not accordance with the initial <b>agreement,</b> <b>unilateral</b> termination of contract without compensation for damages and others. The frequently arising question is whether sports actors, particularly athletes, have the status of ‘nonemployee 2 ̆ 7 professionals, or the status of ‘employees 2 ̆ 7. The various existing opinions related to such issue of status raise certain legal implications, particularly from the manpower aspect which emphasizes the welfare and legal protection of ‘workers 2 ̆ 7, which are also often experienced by athletes. It is expected that this article will be able to provide to the readers a broader view regarding the status of athletes 2 ̆ 7 ‘manpower 2 ̆ 7 status...|$|R
40|$|The Productivity Commission {{was asked}} {{to examine the effects}} of {{bilateral}} and regional trade agreements, including on trade and investment barriers, regional integration and Australia's economy generally. The Commission concluded the benefits of these agreements have been oversold and the processes for developing them should be improved. The Commission found that while there is the potential for some gains from preferential <b>agreements,</b> <b>unilateral</b> reform and non-discriminatory trade liberalisation offer larger benefits. While tariff preferences in trade agreements can benefit some industries, the Commission found little evidence that Australia's recent bilateral agreements had provided substantial commercial benefits. The main factors that influence decisions to do business in other countries are likely to lie outside the scope of such agreements. The study concluded that while preferential trade agreements could increase national income, the net effect is likely to be modest. The study also found that some provisions included in Australia's recent preferential trade agreements — including investor-state dispute settlement mechanisms, government procurement requirements, intellectual property protections and provisions affecting areas traditionally the province of domestic policy, such as culture — potentially entail significant costs or risks. To ensure that options other than trade agreements are properly considered, and that any further agreements entered into are warranted, the study recommended that the Government make changes to its trade policy development processes. Under the Commission's proposals, the Government would undertake an annual Trade Policy Review to better identify priorities, enhance the value of consultation and consider trade policy in a broader context. And where there is an interest in pursuing a trade agreement with particular countries, economic assessments should be based on realistic scenarios with any modelling overseen by an independent body. Final assessments to government should be based on the negotiated text of the agreement. bilateral trade; regional trade; trade liberalisation; investment barriers; trade barriers; bilateral agreements; tariff reductions...|$|R
