50|$|Implicit {{unloading}} of classes, i.e. in an uncontrolled way by {{the garbage}} collector, has changed {{a few times in}} Java. Until Java 1.2. the garbage collector could unload a class whenever it felt it needed the space, independent of which class loader was used to load the class. Starting with Java 1.2 classes loaded via the system classloader were never unloaded and classes loaded via other classloaders only when this other classloader was <b>unloaded.</b> <b>Starting</b> with Java 6 classes can contain an internal marker indicating to the garbage collector they can be unloaded if the garbage collector desires to do so, independent of the classloader used to load the class. The garbage collector is free to ignore this hint.|$|R

50|$|Warrick hoisted out her boats at 0750 and {{commenced}} lowering them soon thereafter. She dispatched {{all of her}} LCM's {{to assist}} in the unloading of nearby attack transports. She soon learned over the voice radio, however, that the smaller LCVP's were showing a tendency to broach and break up on the steep beaches. Beach-masters were accordingly waving off the LCVP's so that the beaches would not become fouled with the wrecks of numerous landing craft, thus impeding the flow of supplies necessary to keep the marines advancing against the stubborn Japanese defenders. Thus, with no lighterage, Warrick did not <b>start</b> <b>unloading</b> her own cargo until the following day.|$|R
30|$|After a containership has berthed at {{the seaside}} of a terminal, the STS cranes <b>start</b> <b>unloading</b> the {{incoming}} containers {{according to the}} unloading plan. STS cranes can use a normal spreader, enabling them to handle one container at a time, or more advanced spreaders (e.g. the twin-lift and tandem-lift) to handle multiple containers {{at the same time}} (Stahlbock and Voß 2008). The Super Post Panamax STS cranes, the current standard for unloading the largest containerships, are able to make approximately 32 lifts per crane per hour (APM Terminals 2014). This allows an STS crane to handle 32 – 64 TEUs per hour with a normal spreader and up to 128 TEUs per hour with a tandem-lift spreader.|$|R
50|$|After {{years of}} being the ABA's strongest team {{on the floor and}} in attendance, the merger caught the Pacers at an awkward moment financially. As {{mentioned}} above, they were included in the merger more or less as an afterthought after the Bulls effectively vetoed the inclusion of the Colonels, who were on far stronger footing financially. The team had <b>started</b> <b>unloading</b> their stars during the last ABA season. After their first NBA season, the Pacers resorted to broadcasting a successful telethon in order to survive financially into their second NBA season. In part thanks to the telethon, led by Nancy Leonard (wife of Hall of Fame coach Bob Leonard), the Pacers' average attendance jumped from 7,615 during the 1976-77 season, their first in the NBA, to 10,982 during the 1977-78 season.|$|R
50|$|On {{returning}} San Diego 29 September, J. Franklin Bell resumed coastal {{operations and}} amphibious training {{in preparation for}} taking the offensive in the Aleutians by recapturing Attu Island. Reclassified APA-16 February 1, 1943, she continued rehearsals until sailing to San Francisco 16 April to embark troops and their equipment. She sailed on 24 April for Cold Bay, Alaska. Though hampered by heavy seas, her task force arrived off Attu 11 May in a dense fog. J. Franklin Bell, now under Comdr. J.B. McGovern, began landing operations. Submerged rocks, pea soup weather, and narrow, rocky beaches permitted {{only two or three}} boats to be unloaded at a time. Two days later she <b>started</b> <b>unloading</b> around the clock, enabling her to finish the task, embark casualties, and head for home by 16 May.|$|R
5000|$|Gil González Dávila {{founded the}} city in 1524 and called Villa de la Natividad de Nuestra Señora, now known as Cieneguita. In 1526 Hernán Cortés came to punish González Dávila and when he arrived on Honduras' coast from Mexico and <b>started</b> <b>unloading</b> horses and cargo from the ships, several horses were drowned, {{and for that reason}} Cortés called it Puerto Caballos. By 1533, a local native leader, called Çiçumba (or Çoçumba, or Socremba, or Joamba ... we don't really know since the Spanish {{recorded}} so many variants of his name) had destroyed the town, reportedly taking a woman from Sevilla, Spain captive. After Çiçumba's defeat in 1536 by Pedro de Alvarado, a new town, Puerto de Caballos was founded on the southern shore of the body of water known as the Laguna de Alvarado.|$|R
500|$|After {{completing}} the loading process on 23 August, Yancey weighed anchor on the 25th {{as a member}} of Task Force (TF) 33. However, the ships had to turn back because of a tropical storm in the vicinity. The typhoon delayed the task force for only a day, as the ships weathered the fringes of the storm at Subic Bay before again getting underway soon thereafter. Yancey entered Tokyo Bay on the morning of 2 September, the day Japan signed the formal articles of surrender {{on the deck of the}} battleship [...] anchored there. Shortly after the conclusion of those ceremonies, the attack cargo ship headed into Yokohama harbor, the third ship in her squadron to enter that port and the first to <b>start</b> <b>unloading.</b> The ship completed her unloading in 19 hours and then proceeded to an anchorage off Yokohama.|$|R
2500|$|The impetus of the American Silver Eagle bullion program {{ultimately}} {{comes from}} executive plans through the 1970s and early 1980s {{to sell off}} silver from the Defense National Stockpile. As the Wall Street Journal explained, [...] "Several administrations had sought unsuccessfully to sell silver from the stockpile, arguing that domestic production of silver far exceeds strategic needs. But mining-state interests had opposed any sale, as had promilitary legislators who wanted assurances that the proceeds {{would be used to}} buy materials more urgently needed for the stockpile rather than merely to reduce the federal deficit." [...] Throughout the period, such sell-offs that did occur, as well as announcements of planned sell-offs, caused immediate declines in the price of silver. The Wall Street Journal reported in September 1976, [...] "When the US government makes noises about selling silver from the federal stockpile, futures traders <b>start</b> <b>unloading</b> futures contracts in speculation that such a sale would depress prices." ...|$|R
5000|$|Calculating {{the elastic}} modulus with {{software}} involves using software filtering techniques to separate the critical unloading data {{from the rest of}} the load-displacement data. The start and end points are usually found by using user defined percentages. This user input increases the variability because of possible human error. It would be best if the entire calculation process was automatically done for more consistent results. A good nanoindentation machine prints out the load unload curve data with labels to each of the segments such as loading, top hold, unload, bottom hold, and reloading. If multiple cycles are used then each one should be labeled. However mores nanoindenters only give the raw data for the load-unload curves. An automatic software technique finds the sharp change from the top hold time to the beginning of the unloading. This can be found by doing a linear fit to the top hold time data. The <b>unload</b> data <b>starts</b> when the load is 1.5 times standard deviation less than the hold time load. The minimum data point is the end of the unloading data. The computer calculates {{the elastic modulus}} with this data according to the Oliver-Pharr (nonlinear). The Doerner-Nix method is less complicated to program because it is a linear curve fit of the selected minimum to maximum data. However, it is limited because the calculated elastic modulus will decrease as more data points are used along the unloading curve. The Oliver-Pharr nonlinear curve fit method to the unloading curve data where [...] is the depth variable, [...] is the final depth and [...] and [...] are constants and coefficients. The software must use a nonlinear convergence method to solve for , [...] and [...] that best fits the unloading data. The slope is calculated by differentiating [...] at the maximum displacement.|$|R
50|$|They {{arrived at}} Foulke Fiord, near Etah on August 31, 1937. Before the {{expedition}} could get settled on land, they experienced {{a series of}} near disasters which almost settled the expedition {{at the bottom of}} the sound. The charts of the area showed 40 ft of water—the ship drew 12 ft—but much to their surprise they found themselves aground. By unloading some of the supplies they were able to re-float the ship at the next tide. On September 1, 1937, a severe gale blew the ship out to sea, the anchor being unable to hold on the rocky bottom. On the return to Etah, one of the engines backfired, starting a fire aboard ship. There were some anxious moments until the fire was extinguished as there was still gasoline, ammunition and dynamite aboard. After two days they were able to get back to Reindeer Point near Etah, only to find that most of the supplies that they had unloaded earlier to re-float the ship were under water, as a 10 ft tide ebbed and flowed there. Finally the ship was <b>unloaded,</b> and work <b>started</b> on enlarging a cabin left by the Humphrey Expedition of 1934-35.|$|R
2500|$|During {{the morning}} of 26 August, 553rd and 204th Fd Companies {{completed}} [...] the rear trestle and approach to the bridge, but when {{attempts were made to}} bring in the rafts to form the first bridge, they were raked by fire in mid-stream and about two-thirds of the crews became casualties. By mid-day half the rafts were in position, but casualties were so heavy that the CRE of 43rd Division, Lt-Col Tom Evill, temporarily withdrew his men. In the afternoon the enemy fire slackened, and the Class 9 bridge (named 'David') was complete by 17.20. Light traffic began to flow, but with little hope of the Bailey bridge ('Goliath') being ready quickly, the Corps Chief Engineer, Brig B.C. Davey, ordered a Bailey pontoon raft to be built as a ferry. With all of the available bridging engineers fully employed, Davey set 207th Fd Park Co to <b>start</b> <b>unloading</b> equipment and reconnoitring approaches while specialist sappers were called up from the rear. The first vehicle rafted across was an RE bulldozer to prepare a ramp; however, it became bogged down and a new ramp had to be built. By 06.00 on 27 August the first tanks were being ferried across to drive off German counter-attacks.|$|R
40|$|On February 20, 2002, a 35 year-old male {{truck driver}} (the victim) {{sustained}} fatal injuries {{as a result}} of being run over by a mobile landfill compactor at a local municipal landfill. The victim, a truck driver for a municipal solid waste (MSW) trucking company, was delivering a load of refuse to the landfill at approximately 2 : 00 p. m. He pulled his semi-truck up to a working face, where landfill employees were operating two landfill compactors and a bulldozer, and <b>started</b> <b>unloading.</b> At approximately 2 : 20 p. m., one of the landfill compactors backed up along the driver’s side of the victim’s truck to get sand from a sand pile. The back up alarm on the compactor was working properly and the operator stated that he looked through both the rear and side mirrors before he began backing up but did not see the victim in his path. When the compactor curved away from the victim’s truck, the other compactor operator saw the victim lying on the ground next to his semitruck waving his hands for help. It appeared that the victim had been struck by the compactor as he was putting a broom into his truck following unloading. The victim suffered massive crushing wounds to his left torso (pelvic area) and left leg. Paramedics were summoned immediately and responded within minutes. The victim was treated at the scene before being transported by helicopter to a hospital trauma center where he died six days later...|$|R
5000|$|On {{the night}} of the 14th-15th a Japanese force of Kirishima, two heavy and two light cruisers, and nine destroyers {{approached}} Guadalcanal. Two US battleships ( [...] and [...] ) were there to meet them, along with four destroyers. This was one of only two battleship-on-battleship encounters during the Pacific War; the other was the lopsided Battle of Surigao Strait in October 1944, part of the Battle of Leyte Gulf. The battleships had been escorting Enterprise, but were detached due to the urgency of the situation. With nine 16-inch (406 mm) guns apiece against eight 14-inch (356 mm) guns on Kirishima, the Americans had major gun and armor advantages. All four destroyers were sunk or severely damaged and withdrawn shortly after the Japanese attacked them with gunfire and torpedoes. Although her main battery remained in action for most of the battle, South Dakota spent much of the action dealing with major electrical failures that affected her radar, fire control, and radio systems. Although her armor was not penetrated, she was hit by 26 shells of various calibers and temporarily rendered, in a US admiral's words, [...] "deaf, dumb, blind, and impotent". Washington went undetected by the Japanese for most of the battle, but withheld shooting to avoid [...] "friendly fire" [...] until South Dakota was illuminated by Japanese fire, then rapidly set Kirishima ablaze with a jammed rudder and other damage. Washington, finally spotted by the Japanese, then headed for the Russell Islands to hopefully draw the Japanese away from Guadalcanal and South Dakota, and was successful in evading several torpedo attacks. Unusually, only a few Japanese torpedoes scored hits in this engagement. Kirishima sank or was scuttled before the night was out, along with two Japanese destroyers. The remaining Japanese ships withdrew, except for the four transports, which beached themselves in the night and <b>started</b> <b>unloading.</b> However, dawn (and US aircraft, US artillery, and a US destroyer) found them still beached, and they were destroyed.|$|R
