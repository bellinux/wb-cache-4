A cut-down version was released in the United States and United Kingdom in September 2010. The critical response was sharply divided: positive reviews described the film as captivating and innovative, while negative critics called it tedious and puerile. The film performed poorly at the box office.|$|E

Edward took the examination to enter Osborne Naval College, and began there in 1907. Hansell had wanted Edward to enter school earlier, but the prince's father had disagreed. Following {{two years at}} Osborne College, {{which he did not}} enjoy, Edward moved on to the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth. A course of two years, followed by entry into the Royal Navy, was planned. A bout of mumps may have made him infertile.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies did {{not achieve}} their first three-game series sweep <b>until</b> <b>almost</b> {{the end of}} May, taking two from the San Francisco Giants, the Arizona Diamondbacks (splitting the series 22), the Atlanta Braves, and the Nationals, and {{dropping}} two to the Giants, the Toronto Blue Jays, and the Astros. However, the Phillies' first sweep was achieved in dramatic fashion, as the offense broke out for 60runs in fivegames, including a 205 win over the Colorado Rockies.|$|E
5|$|After {{this sudden}} spate of activity, Smoke Imix {{continued}} to rule <b>until</b> <b>almost</b> {{the end of}} the 7thcentury; he dedicated another nine known monuments and made important changes to the architecture of Copán, including the construction of Structure2, which closes the northern side of the Great Plaza, and a new version of Temple26, nicknamed Chorcha. Smoke Imix ruled Copán for 67years and died on 15June 695 at the age of 79, an age that was so distinguished that it is used to identify him in place of his name on AltarQ. His tomb had already been prepared in the Chorcha phase of Temple26 and he was buried just two days after his death.|$|E

5|$|In 1949 the Armenian Academy of Sciences began major {{excavations}} of the Garni fortress site led by Babken Arakelyan. Architectural historian Alexander Sahinian {{focused on}} the temple itself. It was not <b>until</b> <b>almost</b> twenty years later, on December 10, 1968, that the Soviet Armenian government approved the reconstruction plan of the temple. A group led by Sahinian began reconstruction works in January 1969. It was completed by 1975, almost 300 {{years after it was}} destroyed in an earthquake. The temple was almost entirely rebuilt using its original stones, except the missing pieces which were filled with blank stones intended to be easily recognisable. In 1978 a monument dedicated to Sahinian was erected not far from the temple.|$|E
5|$|In April 1944, {{under the}} command of I Airborne Corps, the brigade took part in Exercise Mush. This was a three-day {{exercise}} in the counties of Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and Wiltshire, during which the entire 6th Airborne Division was landed by air. Unknown to the troops involved, the exercise was a full-scale rehearsal for the division's involvement in the imminent Allied invasion of Normandy. In the invasion, the 6th Airborne Division's two parachute brigades would land {{in the early hours of}} 6 June in Operation Tonga; the 6th Airlanding Brigade would not arrive <b>until</b> <b>almost</b> dusk on the same day. Their objective was to secure the left flank of the invasion area, between the rivers Orne and Dives.|$|E
5|$|In eastern Europe, Romania built {{what were}} termed heroes' war grave cemeteries, either in {{existing}} heroes' cemeteries, on {{the sites of}} the World War I battles, or in new cemeteries symbolically placed {{on the edges of}} towns. The situation was somewhat different in Russia, however, where the Moscow City Fraternal Cemetery was used not just for the war dead of World War I, but also for the casualties of the Civil War, and then the victims of the secret police. It was finally closed by the Bolsheviks in 1925 and turned into a park; subsequently, possibly on the orders of Joseph Stalin, the Eastern Orthodox church and the headstones were systematically destroyed <b>until</b> <b>almost</b> no trace of the cemetery remained.|$|E

5|$|Newport News is {{included}} in the Hampton Roads metropolitan area. It is at the southeastern end of the Virginia Peninsula, on the northern shore of the James River extending southeast from Skiffe's Creek along many miles of waterfront to the river's mouth at Newport News Point on the harbor of Hampton Roads. The area now known as Newport News was once a part of Warwick County. Warwick County was one of the eight original shires of Virginia, formed by the House of Burgesses in the British Colony of Virginia by order of King Charles I, in 1634. The county was largely composed of farms and undeveloped land <b>until</b> <b>almost</b> 250 years later.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Tropical Storm Debby {{were from a}} {{tropical}} wave that moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on September 4. By September 6, satellite images indicated a vigorous tropical wave with intense convection about midway between Africa and the Lesser Antilles. Encountering northwesterly vertical wind shear, convection markedly decreased and weakened on the following day, only to redevelop on September8 after the shear dropped. Post-analysis indicate that the sixth tropical depression of the season developed on September 9 at 1200UTC, about 185mi (300km) east of Barbados; however, it was not operationally classified as Tropical Depression Six <b>until</b> <b>almost</b> 24hours later. Early on September 10, satellite imagery indicated a surface circulation just north of Barbados, around which time the National Hurricane Center (NHC) initiated advisories.|$|E

5|$|Croitoru had {{a history}} of run-ins with the police. Many of his legal {{problems}} came while he was president of the Hamilton, Ontario chapter of the Satan's Choice Outlaw motorcycle club. He was arrested for trafficking cocaine and served ten months in prison. Soon after, he was convicted of assault and was given a sentence of seven months. He encountered more problems on December 15, 1996 when he and several friends from Satan's Choice were kicked out of a strip club for wearing their gang's colors. To get revenge, Croitoru and his friends planned to blow up the strip club. They changed their minds, however, and decided to bomb the local police station instead. The bomb caused $133,000 in damages to the Sudbury, Ontario police station and a nearby bank and injured a police officer. Croitoru and two friends were arrested and charged, but the trial did not begin <b>until</b> <b>almost</b> two years later.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Charlie {{developed}} on August21 {{to the southwest}} of the Cape Verde islands. At the time, the Weather Bureau did not consider Charlie to be a tropical cyclone <b>until</b> <b>almost</b> a week later. For four days, the storm tracked generally to the west as a weak tropical storm. On August25, it turned to the northwest and intensified, becoming a hurricane on August28. On August30, Charlie attained peak winds of 110mph (175km/h), although the Hurricane Hunters estimated higher winds. At the time, the hurricane was stalled to the east-southeast of Bermuda, and subsequently turned to a westward drift. On September2, Charlie turned {{to the north and}} northeast. At the time, it co-existed with two other hurricanes, Dog and Easy; it is a rare occurrence for three hurricanes to exist simultaneously in the Atlantic. Charlie slowly weakened and lost tropical characteristics, and by September5 Charlie had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about 480mi (775km) southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia. It dissipated later on September5 without having affected land.|$|E
5|$|In March 1942 the {{squadron}} moved to RAF Redhill, Surrey where it assumed No. 452 Squadron's front line duties {{as part of}} No. 11 Group RAF. These included shipping protection patrols, escorting bombers, conducting fighter sweeps over northern France and contributing to the air defence of southern England. Fighter Command had received authorisation to launch a full-scale offensive campaign against German air units shortly before No.457 Squadron arrived at Redhill, and it became part of this effort. The squadron first saw action on 26March when Brothers shot down a Bf109 during a multi-squadron fighter sweep over France, though one of its Spitfires was lost in this action. By {{the end of its}} first week of operations No.457 Squadron had shot down three German aircraft and inflicted damage on several others and it went on to conduct 32 operations over German territory by 26April. These operations often encountered fierce opposition, and German Fw190 fighters proved superior to the Spitfire Mark Vs that No.457 Squadron was equipped with. The squadron scored its last victory over Europe on 29April, though fighter sweeps over France continued <b>until</b> <b>almost</b> the end of May.|$|E

5|$|The Late Middle Ages in Europe {{as a whole}} {{correspond}} to the Trecento and Early Renaissance cultural periods in Italy. Northern Europe and Spain continued to use Gothic styles, which became increasingly elaborate in the 15th century, <b>until</b> <b>almost</b> {{the end of the}} period. International Gothic was a courtly style that reached much of Europe in the decades around 1400, producing masterpieces such as the Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry. All over Europe secular art continued to increase in quantity and quality, and in the 15th century the mercantile classes of Italy and Flanders became important patrons, commissioning small portraits of themselves in oils as well as a growing range of luxury items such as jewellery, ivory caskets, cassone chests, and maiolica pottery. These objects also included the Hispano-Moresque ware produced by mostly Mudéjar potters in Spain. Although royalty owned huge collections of plate, little survives except for the Royal Gold Cup. Italian silk manufacture developed, so that Western churches and elites no longer needed to rely on imports from Byzantium or the Islamic world. In France and Flanders tapestry weaving of sets like The Lady and the Unicorn became a major luxury industry.|$|E
5|$|Through {{much of the}} Middle Ages and Renaissance the Catholic Church {{had only}} a small number of {{cardinals}} at any one time, down to as few as seven under either Pope Alexander IV (1254-1261) or Pope John XXI (1276-1277). Difficult travel further reduced the number arriving at conclaves. With a small electorate an individual vote was significant, and was not easily shaken from familial or political lines. Conclaves could last months and even years. In addition to the decree in 1274 that the electors should be locked in seclusion, Gregory X also limited each cardinal elector to two servants, and rationed their food progressively on the fourth and ninth days should they fail to elect a new pope. The cardinals disliked these strict rules of the conclave; Pope Adrian V temporarily suspended them in 1276 and John XXI's Licet felicis recordationis formally revoked them later that same year - both these Popes had intended to promulgate a new constitution governing papal elections, but died before doing so. Lengthy elections resumed and continued to be the norm until 1294, when a Benedictine hermit was elected as Pope Celestine V. Celestine reinstated the strict conclave, but soon resigned the papacy. Long interregna occurred after the reinstatement of the conclave: in 1314–1316 during the Avignon Papacy, where the original conclaves were dispersed by besieging mercenaries and not reconvened <b>until</b> <b>almost</b> two years had passed; and in 1415–1417, as a result of the Western Schism.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Morris {{returned}} to England, {{the setting for}} his three Test centuries five years earlier, for another Ashes series. In a tour opening festival match against East Molesey, Morris made 103 in eighty minutes. After the modest run scoring of the previous three Test seasons, Morris warmed up in 10 lead-in matches that yielded a moderate return of 347 runs at 34.70. However, his performances {{in the first two}} drawn Tests, in which he struck three half centuries, indicated that might be returning to his earlier form. He was unable to maintain his form however, and did not pass 40 in the last three Tests, ending the series with 337 runs at a modest average of 33.70. The teams were locked at 0–0 heading into the Fifth Test, and Hassett and Morris thought that the pitch at The Oval would favour fast bowling. However, they were mistaken, and Morris could manage only 16 and 26 as the hosts' spinners cut down the tourists, while their Australian counterparts watched from the stands. Denis Compton pulled Morris' spin for four to seal an English win by eight wickets. This meant that the hosts regained the Ashes {{for the first time in}} two decades with a 1–0 triumph, and Morris thus tasted a series defeat for the first time in his career. It was a low-scoring series, and Morris placed third in the Australian Test averages and aggregates, behind Hassett with 365 at 36.50. Morris' batting was regarded by commentators as being more carefree than during the Invincibles tour. He took his second and final wicket in Test cricket, that of Alec Bedser, in the Third Test at Old Trafford. Morris also struggled in the first-class matches, making 1,302 runs at 38.09 with only one century, which did not come <b>until</b> <b>almost</b> four months had elapsed on tour, against the Gentlemen of England. Morris placed third in the aggregates but only ranked sixth in the averages. He made many starts, with 11 fifties, but was only able to capitalise and reached triple figures only once.|$|E
