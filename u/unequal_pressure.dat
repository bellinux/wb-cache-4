60|$|Measurements.--It {{has been}} already shown that when both plots are present (Plate 4, Fig. 8, ~4~), they form the termini of a base line, from which {{any part of}} the pattern may be triangulated, as {{surveyors}} would say. Also, that when only one plot exists (~3~), and the pattern has an axis (which it necessarily has in all ordinary ii and oo cases), a perpendicular can be let fall upon that axis, whose intersection with it will serve as a second point of reference. But our methods must not be too refined. The centres of the plots are not determinable with real exactness, and repeated prints from so soft a substance as flesh are often somewhat dissimilar, the one being more or less broadened out than the other, owing to <b>unequal</b> <b>pressure.</b> It is therefore well to use such other more convenient points of reference as the particular pattern may present. In loops, the intersection of the axis with the summit of the innermost bend, whether it be a staple or the envelope to a rod (Fig. 14, second and third rows of diagrams), is a well-defined position. In spirals, the centre of the pattern is fairly well defined; also a perpendicular erected {{from the middle of the}} base to the outline above and below (Fig. 8, ~4~) is precise and convenient.|$|E
6000|$|To THE EDITOR: Only last week, while {{crossing}} the Equator (W. 26-15), I {{became aware of}} a furious and irregular cannonading some fifteen or twenty knots S. 4 E. Descending to the 500 ft. level, I found a party of Transylvanian tourists engaged in exploding scores of the largest pattern atmospheric bombs (A. B. C. standard) and, in the intervals of their pleasing labours, firing bow and stern smoke-ring swivels. This orgie--I can give it no other name--went on {{for at least two}} hours, and naturally produced violent electric derangements. My compasses, of course, were thrown out, my bow was struck twice, and I received two brisk shocks from the lower platform-rail. On remonstrating, I was told that these [...] "professors" [...] were engaged in scientific experiments. The extent of their [...] "scientific" [...] knowledge, may be judged {{by the fact that they}} expected to produce (I give their own words) [...] "a little blue sky" [...] if [...] "they went on long enough." [...] This in the heart of the Doldrums at 450 feet! I have no objection to any amount of blue sky in its proper place (it can be found at the 4000 level for practically twelve months out of the year), but I submit, with all deference to the educational needs of Transylvania, that [...] "skylarking" [...] in the centre of a main-travelled road where, at the best of times, electricity literally drips off one's stanchions and screw blades, is unnecessary. When my friends had finished, the road was seared, and blown, and pitted with <b>unequal</b> <b>pressure</b> layers, spirals, vortices, and readjustments for at least an hour. I pitched badly twice in an upward rush--solely due to these diabolical throw-downs--that came near to wrecking my propeller. Equatorial work at low levels is trying enough in all conscience without the added terrors of scientific hooliganism in the Doldrums.|$|E
60|$|From {{this same}} Principle also (viz. the <b>unequal</b> <b>pressure</b> of the Air against the unequal superficies of the water) {{proceeds}} {{the cause of}} the accession or incursion of any floating body against the sides of the containing Vessel; or the appropinquation of two floating bodies, as Bubbles, Corks, Sticks, Straws, &c. one towards another. As for instance, Take a Glass-jar, such as AB in the seventh Figure, and filling it pretty near the top with water, throw into it a small round piece of Cork, as C, and plunge it all over in water, that it be wet, so as that the water may rise up by the sides of it, then placing it any where upon the superficies, about an inch, or one inch and a quarter from any side, and you shall perceive it by degrees to make perpendicularly toward the nearest part of the side, and the nearer it approaches, the faster to be moved, the reason of which Phænomenon will be found no other then this, that the Air has a greater pressure against the middle of the superficies, then it has against those parts that approach nearer, and are contiguous to the sides. Now that the pressure is greater, may (as I shewed before in the explication of the third Figure) be evinced from the flatting of the water in the middle, which arises from the gravity of the under fluid: for since, as I shewed before, if there were no gravity in the under fluid, or that it were equal to that of the upper, the terminating Surface would be Spherical, and since it is the additional pressure of the gravity of water that makes it so flat, it follows, that the pressure upon the middle must be greater then towards the sides. Hence the Ball having a stronger pressure against that side of it which respects the middle of the superficies, then against that which respects the approximate side, must necessarily move towards that part, from whence it finds least resistance, and so be accelerated, as the resistance decrease. Hence the more the water is raised under that part of its way it is passing above the middle, the faster it is moved: And therefore you will find it to move faster in E then in D, and in D then in C. Neither could I find the floating substance to be moved at all, until it were placed upon some part of the Superficies that was sensibly elevated above the height of the middle part. Now that this may be the true cause, you may try with a blown Bladder, and an exactly round Ball upon a very smooth side of some pliable body, as Horn or Quicksilver. For if the Ball be placed under a part of the Bladder which is upon one side of the middle of its pressure, and you press strongly against the Bladder, you shall find the Ball moved from the middle towards the sides.|$|E

40|$|Outcomes of {{competitive}} mycelial interactions determine saprotrophic fungal community composition and are regulated by biotic (e. g. invertebrate grazing) and abiotic (e. g. climate) factors. Selective grazing can moderate {{the effects of}} elevated temperature on fungal interactions. In natural systems, however, patchy and aggregative distributions of invertebrates exert <b>unequal</b> grazing <b>pressures</b> on competing fungi. We explored whether restricting grazing to the territory of one fungal competitor affected the potential of Oniscus asellus (Isopoda) to control the outcomes of interactions and mediate responses to elevated temperature. Restricted grazing prevented the dominance of any one fungal species {{in the majority of}} interactions and, indirectly, altered the influence of warming. The location of grazer restriction was, however, only important during certain interactions. Selective pressures reflected feeding preferences, but grazer location determined the extent of selective grazing pressure exerted. Aggregation of macro-invertebrate grazers appears important in maintaining multi-species assemblages of wood-decomposer fungi in a changing climate...|$|R
40|$|Color {{patterns}} are {{strongly related to}} defensive strategies in anurans. Some anurans present more than one morphotype. Leptodactylus fuscus, for example, present two morphotypes (with and without vertebral white line). The proportion of each pattern in nature is different, whereby there are always more individuals without stripes. Therefore, we speculated if this difference in the observed color pattern is due to <b>unequal</b> predation <b>pressures</b> (i. e. stronger over the striped morphotype), and/or {{if there is a}} genetic component related to autossomic heritage. To test the selective predation over the morphotypes, we prepared plasticine models of L. fuscus with both phenotypes and placed them in the field. We did not find evidence of predation selection and as we found significant relationships between the proportions of the phenotypes and Mendelian proportions, we suggest that the phenotypes observed in this species are genetically determined (involving dominant and recessive alleles) and may not have a defensive function...|$|R
60|$|On {{the other}} hand an {{inquirer}} who insists on knowing what suction is, may obtain from the physicist answers which give him clear ideas, not only about it but about many other things. He learns that on ourselves and all things around, there is an atmospheric pressure amounting to about 15 pounds on the square inch: 15 pounds being the average weight of a column of air having a square inch for its base and extending upwards from the sea-level to the limit of the Earth's atmosphere. He is made to observe that when he puts {{one end of a}} tube into water and the other end into his mouth, and then draws back his tongue, so leaving a vacant space, two things happen. One is that the pressure of air outside his cheeks, no longer balanced by an equal pressure of air inside, thrusts his cheeks inwards; and the other is that the pressure of air {{on the surface of the}} water, no longer balanced by an equal pressure of air within the tube and his mouth (into which part of the air from the tube has gone) the water is forced up the tube in consequence of the <b>unequal</b> <b>pressure.</b> Once understanding thus the nature of the so-called suction, he sees how it happens that when the plunger of the pump is raised and relieves from atmospheric pressure the water below it, the atmospheric pressure on the water in the well, not being balanced by that on the water in the tube, forces the water higher up the tube, so that it follows the plunger. And now he sees why the water cannot be raised beyond the theoretic limit of 32 feet: a limit made much lower in practice by imperfections in the apparatus. For if, simplifying the conception, he supposes the tube of the pump to be a square inch in section, then the atmospheric pressure of 15 pounds per square inch on the water in the well, can raise the water in the tube to such height only that the entire column of it weighs 15 pounds. Having been thus enlightened about the pump's action, the action of a barometer becomes intelligible. He perceives how, under the conditions established, the weight of the column of mercury balances that of an atmospheric column of equal diameter; and how, as the weight of the atmospheric column varies, there is a corresponding variation in the weight of the mercurial column,--shown by change of height. Moreover, having previously supposed that he understood the ascent of a balloon when he ascribed it to relative lightness, he now sees that he did not truly understand it. For he did not recognize it as a result of that upward pressure caused by the difference between the weight of the mass formed by the gas in the balloon plus the cylindrical column of air extending above it to the limit of the atmosphere, and the weight of a similar cylindrical column of air extending down to the under surface of the balloon: this difference of weight causing an equivalent upward pressure on the under surface.|$|E

40|$|The {{notion of}} a "plug " bearing taken up in this work refers to bodies moving within tight {{circular}} conduits. Our interest lies in the hydrodynamic film generated in the narrow in-terspace between body and wall under conditions of an incompressible fluid and <b>unequal</b> boundary <b>pressures.</b> For generality rotation as well as translation is considered. Perfor-mance characteristics are given for nontilting frustums, both diverging and converging {{in the direction of}} motion. It is shown that for a given body shape the amount of leakage past the plug is the same regardless of its orientation. However, with geometries whose film increases in the direction of plug velocity there is a wide range of operating condi-tions when the resultant force is such as to drive the body {{against the wall of the}} conduit; over the same range, shapes which produce films decreasing in the direction of motion yield a floating force. 1 The Plug Bearing We are considering here the case of a body moving within a cir-cular conduit subject to <b>unequal</b> boundary <b>pressures,</b> as shown in Fig. 1. Our interest is in configurations which over some sections, at least, are sufficiently close to the walls of the conduit so as to form clearances of an order of magnitude found in hydrodynamic lubrication. It is these regions of tight clearances that we wish to examine in order to ascertain their effect on the internal ballistics of the moving body. Due to its shape and role, we shall refer to this sort of physical setup, as a plug bearing. There is a wide range of applications where plug bearings are used. In the compressible fluids area, one can cite the movement of projectiles in unrifled bores, the travel of high-speed vehicles with-in tubes, the dispatch of capsules in pneumatic systems, various servo-mechanisms, and others. Of the incompressible applications, one is the familiar case of piston rings in internal combustion en-gines, slug transportation, a whole range of valving arrangements, in particular spool valves, and, of recent interest, the mechanics of an embolism in the human body.

Although the results indicated that there were no significant differences between the two groups in the magnitude and position of the peak pressure, there was a greater variability among subjects in the LPT group than the symmetrical group.

40|$|Patients with {{significant}} stenosis at the carotid bifurcation are traditionally subjected to four vessel aortic arch angiography prior to consideration for carotid endarterectomy. The {{advent of the}} non-invasive vascular laboratory has necessitated a reappraisal of this approach. Aims:o 1. Determine the yield from aortic arch angiography and its influence on surgical management. 2. Evaluate the accuracy of clinical examination and the non-invasive vascular laboratory in the detection of aortic arch branch lesions. Methods:One hundred and twenty-nine consecutive patients undergoing evaluation for carotid endarterectomy were prospectively enrolled into the study. The protocol entailed:o 1. Clinical recording of upper limb pulses, blood pressure and supraclavicular bruits. 2. Duplex scan examination to evaluate proximal inflow into the carotid arteries. 3. Four vessel aortic arch angiography to detect aortic branch lesions. Data from the non-invasive tests were compared to angiography. Patients with aortic arch branch lesions were further evaluated to determine the proportion requiring additional surgery. Results:Nineteen patients had angiographic evidence of aortic branch disease (14. 7 %); six involved the common carotid artery, three the innominate artery and 10 the subclavian artery. All of these lesions were detected by the combination of <b>unequal</b> blood <b>pressure,</b> pulse deficit, bruit or duplex scan.
