40|$|Complex fluids exhibit {{time-dependent}} {{changes in}} viscosity {{that have been}} ascribed to both thixotropy and aging. However, {{there is no consensus}} for which phenomenon is the origin of which changes. A novel thixotropic model is defined that incorporates aging. Conditions under which viscosity changes are due to thixotropy and aging are unambiguously defined. Viscosity changes in a complex fluid during a period of rest after destructuring exhibit a bifurcation at a critical volume fraction PHIc 2. For volume fractions less than PHIc 2, the viscosity remains finite in the limit t => infinite. For volume fractions above critical the viscosity grows without limit, so aging occurs at rest. At constant shear rate there is no bifurcation, whereas under constant shear stress the model predicts a new bifurcation in the viscosity at a critical stress sB, identical to the yield stress sy observed <b>under</b> <b>steady</b> <b>conditions.</b> The divergence of the viscosity for stress s sB is best defined as aging. However, for s > sB, where the viscosity remains finite, it seems preferable to use the concepts of restructuring and destructuring, rather than aging and rejuvenation. Nevertheless, when a stress sA (sB) is applied during aging, slower aging is predicted and discussed as true rejuvenation. Plastic behaviour is predicted <b>under</b> <b>steady</b> <b>conditions</b> when s > sB. The Herschel-Bulkley model fits the flow curve for stresses close to sB, whereas the Bingham model gives a better fit for s >> sB. Finally, the model's predictions are shown to be consistent with experimental data from the literature for the transient behaviour of laponite gels...|$|E

The problem is solved analytically together with associated boundary conditions. It is found that there exists a strong interaction between roughness and slip effects. A comparison with the case of an infinitely long journal bearing [2] shows that there are significant qualitative and quantitative differences in load capacity and coefficient of friction.

All the leaf samples exhibit an optimum curve of steady state fluorescence yield (Fs) versus the light intensity but its position with respect to light intensity varies considerably from one species to another or from one sample to other even in the same plant or within the same leaf sample. However, the optimum level of Fs was always at a moderate light intensity. By using the modulated fluorescence technique, the system with all closed (Flm) or open reaction center (Flo) were measured in <b>steady</b> state <b>conditions.</b> Each experimentally measured fluorescence yield was separated into a fluorescence emission of open (Fopen = Flo,(1 —Vs)) and closed (Fclosed = (Flm.

With increasing light intensity, the fraction of open RC decreased while the fraction of closed RC increased. Maximum quantum efficiency (ΦPo) and actual quantum efficiency (ΦP) decreased by increasing light intensity. An optimum level of Fs was observed, when the fraction of closed reaction centers Vs of each sample was about 0. 2 showing a common quenching mechanism which determines the fluorescence properties <b>under</b> <b>steady</b> state <b>condition.</b> This explains the apparent phenomenological contradiction that the fluorescence yield <b>under</b> <b>steady</b> state <b>conditions</b> can increase or decrease upon an increase of actinic ligh...|$|R
