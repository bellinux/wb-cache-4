25|$|Until {{the late}} 1970s, Malaysia was the world's {{foremost}} producer of tin, supplying roughly 40% of the non-communist world's tin. Nevertheless, tin reserves were declining; mining's {{contribution to the}} GDP was projected to fall 13% {{over the course of}} the Second Malaysia Plan, due to the exhaustion of tin and iron reserves. However, bauxite and copper continued to contribute to the mining sector in the early 1970s. Malay participation in the mining sector was minimal, and as much as 70% of the industry remained <b>under</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>control.</b> This was a legacy of the British colonial era; many British firms, which had arrived in the 19th century to exploit Malaysian mineral resources, had not departed yet. Malay participation in the mining sector—especially in tin—was further hampered by the British tendency in the 19th century to bring in cheap Chinese labour; most of those employed in mining were still Chinese as late as 1970.|$|E

25|$|During the Qianlong reign (1735–96) the dynasty {{reached its}} apogee but then began its initial decline in {{prosperity}} and imperial control. The population rose to some 400 million, but taxes and government revenues were fixed {{at a low}} rate, virtually guaranteeing eventual fiscal crisis. Corruption set in, rebels tested government legitimacy, and ruling elites failed to change their mindsets {{in the face of}} changes in the world system. Following the Opium War, European powers imposed unequal treaties, free trade, extraterritoriality and treaty ports <b>under</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>control.</b> The Taiping Rebellion (1850–64) and the Dungan Revolt (1862–77) in Central Asia led to the deaths of some 20 million people, most of them due to famines caused by war. In spite of these disasters, in the Tongzhi Restoration of the 1860s, Han Chinese elites rallied to the defense of the Confucian order and the Qing rulers. The initial gains in the Self-Strengthening Movement were destroyed in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1895, in which the Qing lost its influence over Korea and the possession of Taiwan. New Armies were organized, but the ambitious Hundred Days' Reform of 1898 was turned back in a coup by Empress Dowager Cixi, a conservative leader. When the Scramble for Concessions by foreign powers triggered the violently anti-foreign Yihetuan ("Boxers"), the foreign powers invaded China, Cixi declared war on them, leading to defeat and the flight of the Imperial Court to Xi'an.|$|E

But I had been wronged by both belligerents; and it was soon agreed, by mutual consent, to drop the whole subject. As for redress or compensation, I was never fool enough to seek it. On the contrary, finding how unpopular it made a man among the merchants, to prove anything against Great Britain, just at that moment, I was wisely silent, thus succeeding in saving my character, which would otherwise have followed my property, as the shortest method of making a troublesome declaimer hold his tongue.|$|E
60|$|When {{railways}} were new, the Manchu Government, {{like the}} universities of Oxford and Cambridge (which it resembled in many ways), objected to them, and did all it could {{to keep them}} at a distance.[99] In 1875 a short line was built by foreigners from Shanghai to Woosung, but the Central Government was so shocked that it caused it to be destroyed. In 1881 the first permanent railway was constructed, but not very much was accomplished until after the Japanese War of 1894-5. The Powers then thought that China was breaking up, and entered upon a scramble for concessions and spheres of influence. The Belgians built the important line from Peking to Hankow; the Americans obtained a concession for a Hankow-Canton railway, which, however, has only been constructed as far as Changsha. Russia built the Manchurian Railway, connecting Peking with the Siberian Railway and with Europe. Germany built the Shantung Railway, from Tsingtau to Tsinanfu. The French built a railway in the south. England sought to obtain a monopoly of the railways in the Yangtze valley. All these railways were to be owned by foreigners and managed by foreign officials of the respective countries which had obtained the concessions. The Boxer rising, however, made Europe aware that some caution was needed if the Chinese {{were not to be}} exasperated beyond endurance. After this, ownership of new railways was left to the Chinese Government, but with so much foreign control as to rob it of most of its value. By this time, Chinese public opinion had come to realize that there must be railways in China, and that the real problem was how to keep them under Chinese control. In 1908, the Tientsin-Pukow line and the Shanghai-Hangchow line were sanctioned, to be built by the help of foreign loans, but with all the administrative control {{in the hands of the}} Chinese Government. At the same time, the Peking-Hankow line was bought back by the Government, and the Peking-Kalgan line was constructed by the Chinese without foreign financial assistance. Of the big main lines of China, this left not much foreign control outside the Manchurian Railway (Chinese Eastern Railway) and the Shantung Railway. The first of these is mainly <b>under</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>control</b> and must now be regarded as permanently lost, until such time as China becomes strong enough to defeat Japan in war; and the whole of Manchuria has come more or less under Japanese control. But the Shantung Railway, by the agreement reached at Washington, is to be bought back by China--five years hence, if all goes well. Thus, except in regions practically lost to China, the Chinese now have control of all their more important railways, or will have before long. This is a very hopeful feature of the situation, and a distinct credit to Chinese sagacity.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} unique in testing the {{importance}} of the foreign ownership definition when estimating productivity spillovers from foreign direct investment (FDI) to domestic firms; a crucial aspect in countries with a widespread use of holding companies. In addition, it moves beyond the standard framework by not only analyzing aggregate productivity spillovers, but also testing the importance of both domestic firm characteristics and FDI characteristics. The empirical analysis is the first one to exploit the rich details offered by official Danish firm-level panel data. The analysis displays significant evidence of negative spillovers at the aggregate level, but the results differ widely across industries. It also reveals that not including firms <b>under</b> indirect <b>foreign</b> <b>control</b> in the group of foreign firms, as is done in some studies, leads to biased results. With regard to domestic firm characteristics, high export orientation and high competition mitigate some of the negative productivity spillovers. Finally, the estimations show that the negative spillovers largely stem from foreign firms (i) with low productivity, (ii) with high foreign trade orientation, and (iii) ultimately controlled by investors outside Scandinavia...|$|R
25|$|Although three bases {{constructed}} by the British on tea plantations at Chabua, Mohanbari, and Sookerating were declared operational in August 1942, and construction of a fourth began at Jorhat, none {{were expected to be}} ready for all-weather operations before November or December because of problems with unskilled indigenous labor and the failure of promised heavy equipment to arrive from the United States. Throughout the monsoon rains Dinjan remained the chief transport base. The dismal results of the India-China Ferry to this point led to a proposal in Washington to turn over control of the operation entirely to CNAC, which would place U.S. military personnel in a combat area <b>under</b> <b>foreign</b> civilian <b>control.</b> Stilwell vigorously and successfully opposed the plan. He reinforced his position by insisting that CNAC lease its C-53s and crews participating in the airlift to the AAF to assure that they would carry only essential cargo and not commercial activity. The airlift lost its first aircraft to accident on 23 September 1942, presumably from icing, after which losses of transports increased sharply.|$|R

Statistical tests were then carried out, on five year average and annual bases, to establish whether there were differences in the performances {{of the two groups}} of firms. Results revealed statistically significant differences in the reported performances of <b>Foreign</b> <b>Controlled</b> Domestic Companies and United Kingdom Domestic Companies operating in the United Kingdom over the five year period. <b>Foreign</b> <b>controlled</b> firms significantly <b>under</b> performed United Kingdom Domestic Companies of comparable size and industry.

40|$|Protein and operon fusions {{between the}} {{manganese}} superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) gene, sodA, and genes of the lactose operon were constructed {{in an attempt}} to explore the effects of various factors on MnSOD expression and the level at which they operate. In sodA-lacZ protein fusions, induction of beta-galactosidase perfectly mimicked MnSOD induction (i. e., beta-galactosidase was not expressed in anaerobiosis and was induced by oxygen, redox-cycling compounds in aerobiosis, and iron chelators in anaerobiosis). In tac-sodA operon fusions, MnSOD induction was monitored only by the lactose operon inducer isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside. Various plasmids carrying part or all of the sodA regulatory and structural region inhibited aerobic beta-galactosidase induction in sodA-lacZ fusions. This included plasmids carrying only the transcription start and upstream region and also plasmids which did not contain this region and in which MnSOD was <b>under</b> <b>foreign</b> transcriptional <b>control.</b> The role of metal ions was also investigated. Addition of Mn(II) enhanced MnSOD activity but did not affect induction. The anaerobic expression of MnSOD from the oxygen-insensitive tac promoter was enhanced threefold by iron-chelating agents, implying a posttranscriptional or most likely a posttranslational modulation of enzyme activity via metal ions. To accommodate all these data, multiregulation of MnSOD is proposed...|$|R

When the war broke out, according to Duisberg, he had immediately realized that it could only bring disadvantages for the chemical industry. That prediction, continued the Geman industrial leader, had proven correct [10]. World War I resulted in enormous losses for the German chemical industry in general and I. G. Farben in particular. As a result of the Allied blockade, foreign trade virtually came to a standstill. Direct investments in allied countries came <b>under</b> <b>foreign</b> government <b>control</b> and were subsequently sold. In 1919 I. G Farben faced the formidable task of reestablishing itself in foreign markets. Its prospects appeared unclear. Owing to Farben's strong prewar bargaining position and its prominent place in the German war economy a conglomeration of forces ranging from Allied political leaders, industrial competitors, to shapers of public opinion now all sought to hamper its exports. The wartime efforts of England, France, and the United States to build up their own explosives and fertilizer production rendered a future protectionist front against I. G. Farben all too predictable. Nevertheless, Farben still maintained a competitive advantage in all of its major production fields. Despite the perpetuation of official anti-German propaganda, its dyestuffs and other products remained in high demand. In this paper I will examine the company's strategy to regain its American foreign trade position during the 1920 s. By {{the end of the war}} I. G.
