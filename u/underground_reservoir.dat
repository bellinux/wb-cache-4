5|$|The Ombla {{is used as}} {{a source}} of {{drinking}} water for Dubrovnik's water supply network, and construction of a hydroelectric power plant has been planned for the past two decades. , the plans entail construction of a subsurface reservoir and a 68megawatt power plant. The plan sparked controversy amid doubts raised with respect to environmental protection and biodiversity management, technical and financial feasibility, and procedural problems related to the project. A particular concern expressed was that the <b>underground</b> <b>reservoir</b> might trigger earthquakes.|$|E

25|$|Infiltration {{trenches}} are shallow excavated structures {{filled with}} permeable {{materials such as}} gravel or rock to create an <b>underground</b> <b>reservoir.</b> They are designed to hold stormwater runoff within a subsurface trench and gradually release it into the surrounding soil and groundwater systems. Although they are generally not designed as a treatment measure but can provide some level of treatment by retaining pollutants and sediments. Runoff volumes and peak discharges from impervious areas are reduced by capturing and infiltrating flows.|$|E
500|$|The next {{extension}} {{took place}} in 1884. [...] A cooling pond and a leat (an artificial waterway) were built on land behind the pumping station, and a new [...] <b>underground</b> <b>reservoir</b> was built by J.T. Chappell. [...] It ran for [...] westwards from the complex. [...] Brighton Water Corporation spent £11,000 on this work and on the building of two other reservoirs in Brighton, at Dyke Road and Race Hill. [...] All three were built of tile, brick and Portland cement. [...] They were constantly replenished by a -per-minute inflow from numerous natural fissures in the chalk.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{approaches to}} the safety justification of the gas condensate and brine long-term storage in the <b>underground</b> <b>reservoirs</b> formed by the nuclear explosion technology. Gas condensate and brine are the intermediate level liquid radioactive waste containing isotopes:  3 Н,  137 Cs and  90 Sr, in traces -  239 Pu,  235 U,  241 Am. Safety of the gas condensate and brine long-term storage in the <b>underground</b> <b>reservoirs</b> is assessed {{on the base of}} the multi-barrier principle implementation, used during radioactive waste disposal.

500|$|While {{they are}} common in the {{northern}} portion of Florida, no underground springs feed water into the Everglades system. An <b>underground</b> <b>reservoir</b> called the Floridan Aquifer lies about [...] {{below the surface of}} South Florida. The Everglades has an immense capacity for water storage, owing to the permeable limestone beneath the exposed land. Most of the water arrives in the form of rainfall, and a significant amount is stored in the limestone. Water evaporating from the Everglades becomes rain over metropolitan areas, providing the fresh water supply for the region. Water also flows into the park after falling as rain to the north onto the watersheds of the Kissimmee River and other sources of Lake Okeechobee, to appear in the Everglades days later. Water overflows Lake Okeechobee into a river 40 to [...] wide, which moves almost imperceptibly.|$|E
500|$|George Luttrell {{inherited}} the castle in 1867 and began an extensive modernisation, {{backed by the}} considerable income from the Dunster estates– {{in a period of}} agricultural boom in England, the estates were producing £22,000 in revenue a year (£1.49million at 2010 prices). It was fashionable during the mid-Victorian period to remodel existing castles to produce what was felt to be a more consistent Gothic or sometimes Picturesque appearance and George, a keen historian, decided to follow this trend at Dunster; in the process, he also hoped to accommodate the larger household and facilities required for a 19th-century landowner: by 1881, the castle required 15 [...] "living-in" [...] servants alone. He employed Anthony Salvin, a noted architect then most famous for his work at Alnwick Castle, to carry out the work between 1868 and 1872 at a total cost of £25,350 (equivalent to £1.76million in 2010). The work included the construction of an <b>underground</b> <b>reservoir,</b> holding [...] of water to provide running water for the castle and village.|$|E

40|$|Natural gas {{is mostly}} formed from plankton—tiny water-dwelling organisms, {{including}} algae and protozoans—that accumulated {{on the ocean}} floor as they died. These organisms were slowly buried and compressed under layers of sediment. Over long periods of time, the pressure and heat generated by overlying sediments converted this organic material into natural gas. Natural gas frequently migrates through porous and fractured reservoir rock with petroleum and subsequently accumulates in <b>underground</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> Because natural gas and petroleum are formed by similar natural processes, these two hydrocarbons are often found together in <b>underground</b> <b>reservoirs...</b>|$|R
500|$|The Ombla HPP is {{proposed}} {{to be built}} as an underground power plant utilizing headwaters of the Ombla River through a planned <b>underground</b> <b>reservoir,</b> which would hold the water behind a grout curtain and a concrete block extending from [...] below sea level to [...] a.s.l. The project entails flooding of a cavern system at the spring to a level [...] below {{the entrance to the}} [...] long Vilina Cave. The proposed power plant is planned to have productive capacity of 68megawatts. The project is to be financed in part through a European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) loan in the amount of 123.2million Euros, approved on 22 November 2011. Total project cost is estimated at 152.4million Euros. Pursuant to the European Union Habitats Directive, an additional assessment and a biodiversity management plan are required before the EBRD actually provides the approved funds. The documents should define any mitigating or compensating activities that might be needed.|$|E
500|$|The {{park has}} five CCC-built picnic shelters: pavilions 1, 3, and 4 {{are made of}} stone and timber with stone fireplaces, while pavilions 2 and 5 each has log columns that support a {{pyramidal}} roof. The CCC also built six rustic latrines with clapboard siding and gable roofs, and an <b>underground</b> <b>reservoir</b> that {{is covered with a}} low hipped roof. Additional structures constructed by the CCC include three overlooks and a rectangular gable-roofed maintenance building with [...] edge siding and exposed rafters made of logs. The structures built by the CCC are noteworthy in that they exemplify the rustic style of construction that was prevalent at national and state parks built during the Great Depression. Workers used locally found, natural materials in construction that blended with the natural surroundings. Not all of the CCC's work has survived. A concession stand was built by the CCC and sold food and souvenirs from the late 1930s to at least 1953, but was not listed on the 1986 NRHP nomination form. The CCC also built a brick and stone incinerator, but it is in ruins now.|$|E
500|$|At its {{greatest}} extent, between 1884 and 1952, the complex {{consisted of two}} boiler houses with condensing engines, a chimney, coal cellars, workshop, cooling pond, leat and <b>underground</b> <b>reservoir.</b> [...] Situated {{on top of a}} naturally fissured chalk hollow, it provided vast quantities of water to the rapidly growing towns of Hove and its larger neighbour, the fashionable seaside resort of Brighton, for more than a century. [...] As new sources of water were found elsewhere and more modern equipment installed to exploit them, the pumping station's importance declined, and by 1971 the Brighton Water Department had closed it and threatened the complex with demolition. [...] An industrial archaeologist offered to restore the buildings and machinery in return for a lease from the Brighton Water Corporation, and a charitable trust was formed to enable this. [...] Expertise developed by the Engineerium's employees and volunteers was exploited across the world: they founded museums, undertook restoration projects and trained young people in engineering heritage conservation. Another enthusiast subsequently bought the complex, and as of [...] it is closed to the public while more restoration and extension work takes place.|$|E

500|$|The Israelis had {{constructed}} {{a series of}} fortifications along the canal called the Bar Lev Line, which was considered impregnable. The main obstacle of these defences was a massive artificial sand wall erected by Israeli engineers, [...] high with a 45–60 degree incline, along the entire Suez Canal. The rampart were reinforced by concrete that also prevented any attempt by amphibious vehicles to climb the sand wall. To blast through the sand barrier the Israelis estimated would take at least twenty-four, probably forty-eight hours. Behind this rampart were a series of 22 fortifications comprising 35 strongpoints. On average, the fortifications were [...] apart. A strongpoint was several stories deep into the sand and provided protection from a 1000-pound (~½ ton) bomb. Strongpoints incorporated trenches, barbed wire, minefields 200 meters deep, numerous bunkers and troop shelters, and firing positions for tanks. Each strongpoint had an <b>underground</b> <b>reservoir</b> filled with crude oil. The oil could be pumped into the Suez Canal via a pipe system, and ignited to create temperatures reaching [...] A second defensive line, [...] behind the main line, was concentrated at likely crossing areas, and designed to be occupied by armored forces, incorporating tank firing positions. A third defensive line, [...] behind the sand rampart, had its defences concentrated on the main roads and principal routes of advance for an attacker. Behind the main line on the canal were concentration areas for armor and infantry, supply depots, numerous artillery positions and so forth.|$|E
2500|$|In situ bitumen production: Many {{companies}} {{experimented with}} thermal techniques to produce heavy {{oil from the}} oilsands, especially in the Cold Lake oilsands deposit, in the 1970s and 1980s.
