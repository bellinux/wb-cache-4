40|$|Fractographic studies {{indicated}} that the collared studs of an aeroengine have failed by over load. Both the studs got fractured in the threaded region in identical fashion. One of the studs had fractured in the compressor side, while the other had fractured in the turbine side. It appears most probable that the high <b>unlocking</b> <b>torque</b> during dis-assembly {{was responsible for the}} overload failure. The deformation of the threads and/or bending of the studs are likely to take place in applications such as the present one and hence high <b>unlocking</b> <b>torque</b> is unavoidable. Therefore, the possibility of threads getting damaged and/or studs getting sheared off during dis-assembly always exists. It is, therefore, recommended that the studs be used only once. After dis-assembly, the old studs have to be replaced by new ones...|$|E
50|$|Land Rover’s {{patented}} Terrain Response {{system which}} debuted on the Discovery 3 is {{fitted as standard}} on all models. Terrain Response allows the driver to adjust chassis and transmission settings to suit the terrain being traversed. Five settings are available via a rotary knob on the centre console. These include general driving; grass, gravel, snow; mud and ruts; sand; and rock crawl. Suspension ride height, engine management, throttle mapping, transfer case ranges, transmission settings, electronic driving aids (such as electronic traction control (ETC), dynamic stability control (DSC) and hill descent control (HDC)) and electronic e-diffs are all manipulated through the Terrain Response system. All Range Rover Sports are equipped with a standard centre e-diff from Magna Steyr Powertrain which electronically locks and <b>unlocks</b> and apportions <b>torque</b> via means of a multi-plate clutch pack located in the transfer case which also offers ‘shift-on-the-move’ dual-range operation. A rear e-diff is optional on all Range Rover Sport models {{and is able to}} lock and unlock instantaneously. An in-dash display is available which, among other things, is linked to Terrain Response and displays important off-road information such as the status of the e-diffs, the angle of the steering and wheel articulation. It is also able to inform the driver of wheels which do not have contact with the ground.|$|R
