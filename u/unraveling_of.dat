25|$|Despite the Union {{tactical}} success, however, it was {{the start}} of a strategic debacle and the <b>unraveling</b> <b>of</b> the Peninsula Campaign. McClellan began to withdraw his army to the southeast and never regained the initiative. The next day the Seven Days Battles continued as Lee attacked Porter at the Battle of Gaines' Mill.|$|E
25|$|While {{many factors}} {{have contributed to}} the {{escalating}} violence, security analysts in Mexico City trace the origins of the rising scourge to the <b>unraveling</b> <b>of</b> a longtime implicit arrangement between narcotics traffickers and governments controlled by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which began to lose its grip on political power in the late 1980s.|$|E

25|$|The <b>unraveling</b> <b>of</b> {{the false}} {{intelligence}} reports began with 23-year-old Sergeant Lonnie D. Franks of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. {{who was an}} intelligence specialist for Gabriel's wing at Udorn. Two days after the strike on the MiG runway, on January 25, 1972, Franks debriefed an F-4 pilot and navigator who had flown a reconnaissance mission. They said they had not received any ground fire or hostile reaction, but had been instructed nevertheless to report hostile reaction.|$|E
25|$|The {{complaint}} {{sets out}} a detailed {{view of the}} {{events leading up to}} the case, the university's response, and the subsequent <b>unraveling</b> <b>of</b> the case; it alleges corruption and collusion between Duke, the hospital, and Nifong. It accuses the university of refusing to enforce its own anti-discrimination policies as to faculty and student harassment of the lacrosse players, and of violating federal law when it issued team key-card access data to the Police without a warrant, and subsequently attempted to cover up the disclosure.|$|E
25|$|The film {{tells the}} story of two women {{separated}} by more than six decades. In 1998, lonely New Yorker Wally Winthrop is obsessed with King Edward VIII's abdication of the British throne for the woman he loved, American divorcée Wallis Simpson. But Wally's research, including several visits to the Sotheby's auction of the Windsor Estate, reveals that the couple's life together was not as perfect as she thought. Weaving back and forth in time, W.E. intertwines Wally's journey of discovery in New York with the story of Wallis and Edward, from the early days of their romance to the <b>unraveling</b> <b>of</b> their lives in the decades that followed.|$|E

40|$|Thirty years ago, {{the present}} author {{discussed}} pure state unraveling (stochastic quantum trajectories) of Markovian open system dynamics.

25|$|Police {{found the}} crime scene in four rooms located under Pierson's garage. Bloody clothing, hair, a burned bankbook and a small bloody {{footprint}} of a child were discovered. Citizens of the town began {{to arrive at the}} scene to watch the <b>unraveling</b> <b>of</b> the crimes Powers had committed. Police began to dig up a freshly filled-in ditch found on Powers' property, and the bodies of Asta Eicher, her children and Dorothy Lemke were uncovered. Evidence and autopsy results showed that the two girls and their mother were strangled to death while the young boy's head was beaten in with a hammer. Lemke was uncovered with a belt wrapped around her neck, with which she was strangled. Love letters were found in the trunk of Powers' automobile. He had written back to many women and had the intentions of stealing their money and killing them, just as with his most recent victims.|$|E
500|$|Within days {{following}} the <b>unraveling</b> <b>of</b> the Rolling Stone story, the North American Interfraternity Conference, the National Panhellenic Council, and the Fraternity and Sorority Political Action Committee demanded that the University of Virginia [...] "immediately reinstate operations for all fraternity and sorority organizations on campus" [...] and issue an apology to Greek students. On December 8, the University of Virginia restated their original decision that the suspensions would be lifted on the resumption of classes in the new term, on January 9.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{increased}} social {{skepticism about the}} prevalence of sexual assault created by the <b>unraveling</b> <b>of</b> Erdely's Rolling Stone report, the Military Justice Improvement Act will be [...] "much harder" [...] to enact, according to Margaret Carlson. Lindy West said that female rape victims will probably {{be less likely to}} report sexual assaults for fear of being questioned by [...] "some teenage 4Channer". Froma Harrop issued a call for media outlets to begin to publicly name rape accusers, explaining that [...] "reporters and editors should expand their sensitivities to include the reputations of those accused, not always justly".|$|E

500|$|Nasser {{had looked}} to a {{regime change in}} Yemen since 1957 and finally put his desires into {{practice}} in January 1962 by giving the Free Yemen Movement office space, financial support, and radio air time. [...] Anthony Nutting's biography of Gamal Abdel-Nasser identifies several factors that led the Egyptian President to send expeditionary forces to Yemen. These included the <b>unraveling</b> <b>of</b> the union with Syria in 1961, which dissolved his United Arab Republic (UAR), damaging his prestige. A quick decisive victory in Yemen could help him recover leadership of the Arab world. Nasser also had his reputation as an anti-colonial force, setting his sights on ridding South Yemen, and its strategic port city of Aden, of British forces.|$|E

Indeed, the Contact Group, headed by Nigeria {{was set up by}} the Authority of Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS to help establish a transitional government with a view to returning that country to political and constitutional order. In furtherance of this objective, Nigeria provided the sum of 10 million US dollars to the Interim Government in Guinea-Bissau to assist in the stabilisation of the country."
