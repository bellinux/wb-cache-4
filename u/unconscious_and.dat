5|$|As {{part of the}} {{promotion}} for the event, Hogan appeared on Hot Properties four days prior to WrestleMania, where he put host Richard Belzer into a front chinlock —a move that cuts off {{the flow of blood}} to the brain.

Belzer later sued Hogan for $5million, but they eventually settled out of court. The night before WrestleMania, Hogan and Mr. T hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live to help promote the event.|$|E

5|$|Bresnahan also {{developed}} the first batting helmet. He {{was hit in}} the head with a pitch by Andy Coakley of the Cincinnati Reds on June 18, 1907. Bresnahan was <b>unconscious,</b> <b>and</b> a Catholic priest read him his last rites. Bresnahan was hospitalized for ten days, during which time he developed schematics for a plastic batting helmet, though this piece of equipment did not become commonplace until the 1940s. Bresnahan was also the first catcher to wear a padded facemask while catching.|$|E

5|$|In the Ramayana, Trijata {{appears as}} a wise old rakshasi, who dreams of Ravana's {{destruction}} and Rama's victory. She accompanies Sita on {{a survey of the}} battlefield of the war between Rama and Ravana, and reassures Sita of Rama's well-being when Sita sees her husband <b>unconscious</b> <b>and</b> presumes him dead. In later Ramayana adaptations, Trijata becomes the daughter of Vibhishana, the brother of Ravana who sides with Rama. She plays a much greater role in later versions, especially Southeast Asian ones.|$|E
5|$|Inhaling helium can be {{dangerous}} if done to excess, since helium is a simple asphyxiant and so displaces oxygen needed for normal respiration. Fatalities have been recorded, including a youth who suffocated in Vancouver in 2003 and two adults who suffocated in South Florida in 2006. In 1998, an Australian girl (her age is not known) from Victoria fell <b>unconscious</b> <b>and</b> temporarily turned blue after inhaling the entire contents of a party balloon.|$|E

5|$|Using a {{searchlight}} {{the helicopter}} crew searched {{the exterior of}} the building and at 1:17 AM February 23, the helicopter spotted a broken window on the 28th floor located in an area that could not be seen from the street. At about 2:15 AM a rescue team was sent to the spot and found the three missing firefighters <b>unconscious</b> <b>and</b> out of air in their SCBAs.

In order to end contact with Coates, Doggett fakes a seizure on her next outing with him and is declared unfit for driving a van. She is replaced as prison van driver by another inmate, Maritza Ramos (played by Diane Guerrero).|$|E
5|$|Aden meets Cassie and flirts with her. He {{ensures that}} her {{previous}} relationship with Ric Dalby (Mark Furze) is definitely over, then asks Cassie out. Her acceptance makes Ric jealous, so {{during a game}} of rugby, he tackles Aden so hard that he is knocked <b>unconscious</b> <b>and</b> hospitalised. Aden's brother Sean (Gabriel Egan) attacks Ric in retaliation, and when Aden recovers, he gives Sean a false alibi. Cassie discovers the truth and breaks up with him. Aden next appears as a rival of Geoff's on the school football team. Annoyed that PE teacher Tony Holden (Jon Sivewright) favours Geoff, Aden spikes Geoff's drink and locks him in the boot of Tony's car. Tony throws Aden off the team, so Aden vandalises Geoff's grandfather's farm, and bullies Geoff and his younger sister Annie (Charlotte Best).|$|E

When Rekha refuses and begs to be freed, he asks her to stay for at least a month so that she can understand him better, and then reduces it to a week. He makes all the arrangements to ensure that she cannot escape. Rekha later slams Chandru with a spade and runs away.

5|$|Chell and GLaDOS {{return to}} the modern {{chambers}} and face Wheatley, who is driven by GLaDOS's software to test them against a series of traps, which Chell escapes. In their final confrontation, Chell attaches three corrupted personality cores (Nolan North) to Wheatley, allowing a second core transfer to restore GLaDOS to control. However, Wheatley blows up the button needed to activate the transfer. With the facility exploding around them due to the impending meltdown of its reactor core, the roof collapses revealing the night sky, whereupon Chell places a portal on the moon overhead. The vacuum of space pulls her and Wheatley through the other portal still inside the chamber, and GLaDOS reasserts her control. GLaDOS retrieves Chell, who falls <b>unconscious,</b> <b>and</b> Wheatley is left in space with a corrupt personality core orbiting him.|$|E
5|$|Dannemann, {{the only}} {{eyewitness}} to Hendrix's final hours, said that sometime after 3 a.m., she prepared two tuna fish sandwiches for them after arriving {{back at her}} basement apartment. Around 4 a.m., Hendrix, struggling with insomnia after having consumed amphetamines hours earlier, asked her for sleeping tablets. She later said she refused his request hoping he would fall asleep naturally. Dannemann said she surreptitiously took a sleeping tablet sometime around 6 a.m., with Hendrix still awake. She awoke sometime between 10 and 10:20a.m. to find him sleeping normally in bed next to her. She said she then left to purchase cigarettes, and when she returned around 11 a.m., found him in bed breathing, although <b>unconscious</b> <b>and</b> unresponsive.
