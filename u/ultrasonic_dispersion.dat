40|$|The present work {{deals with}} an {{ultrasonic}} type of wave propagation characteristics of monolayer graphene on silicon (Si) substrate. An atomistic {{model of a}} hybrid lattice involving a hexagonal lattice of graphene and surface atoms of diamond lattice of Si is developed to identify the carbon-silicon bond stiffness. Properties of this hybrid lattice model is then mapped into a nonlocal continuum framework. Equivalent force constant due to Si substrate is obtained by minimizing the total potential energy of the system. For this equilibrium configuration, the nonlocal governing equations are derived to analyze the <b>ultrasonic</b> wave <b>dispersion</b> based on spectral analysis. From the present analysis we show that the silicon substrate affects only the flexural wave mode. The frequency band gap of flexural mode is also significantly affected by this substrate. The results also show that, the silicon substrate adds cushioning effect to the graphene and it makes the graphene more stable. The analysis also show that the frequency bang gap relations of in-plane (longitudinal and lateral) and out-of-plane (flexural) wave modes depends {{not only on the}} y-direction wavenumber but also on nonlocal scaling parameter. In the nonlocal analysis, at higher values of the y-directional wavenumber, a decrease in the frequency band gap is observed for all the three fundamental wave modes in the graphene-silicon system. The atoms movement in the graphene due to the wave propagation are also captured for all the tree fundamental wave modes. The results presented in this work are qualitatively different from those obtained based on the local analysis and thus, are important for the development of graphene based nanodevices such as strain sensor, mass and pressure sensors, atomic dust detectors and enhancer of surface image resolution that make use of the <b>ultrasonic</b> wave <b>dispersion</b> properties of graphene.
