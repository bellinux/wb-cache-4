In household waste management, the success of such a system depends on the end-consumer, which supplies waste to the reverse supply chain. The aim of this thesis is therefore to examine how reverse logistics may contribute to improve the end-consumer-turned-supplier’s recycling behaviour, while taking the intention-action gap into account. A conceptual framework of recycling behaviour has been developed and tested empirically using a two-group dependent post-test quasi-experimental design following ethical guidelines. Data was collected through a pick-analysis and questionnaire. The empirical setting is a source-separation system, and the experimental and control groups were chosen from a high-rise housing cooperative in an <b>urban</b> <b>residential</b> <b>district</b> in Oslo municipality. Three interventions, or nudges, are designed to change behaviour through either the supplier or system dimensions. 1) Informational nudge to improve motivation through activation of social norms. 2) System nudge through reduced distance. 3) System nudge through access to equipment. The latter two aim to improve convenience. Results show improved recycling behaviour for the experimental group. 17 % more food waste recycled, 29 % less glass and metal disposed of in residual waste, and less contamination within recycled fractions. Control group behaviour stayed constant. Intentions to recycle are similar between the two groups. In conclusion, targeting the end-consumer-turned-supplier through either system or supplier characteristics may improve recycling behaviour and recycling rates. This has both theoretical and practical implications for waste management system design, as this thesis contributes with an increased understanding of the role of the end-consumer-turned-supplier and how any intervention can help improve actual recycling behaviour.

40|$|This {{research}} {{attempts to}} make {{a better understanding of the}} concept of sustainable <b>urban</b> <b>residential</b> <b>district</b> assessment and its role for sustainable development in China. Moreover, the research tries to establish a framework of feasible and effective sustainable residential district assessment items for China. And then, base on the framework this research will develop a Sustainable Residential District (SRD) Rating System (a computer program) to measure the performance on the sustainability issues, and thus to promote the sustainable development in the urbanization of China. Over the past 15 years, the importance of sustainable development has been recognized by the whole world. Meanwhile, in the building field many green building assessment tools such as BREEAM, LEED, CASBEE and others were established in many developed countries. Now, these assessment tools have developed various versions for different building styles and scales, and the assessment tools for area residential development is latest version in BREEAM, LEED and CASBEE. On the other hand, with the fast urbanization a lot of big scale residential developments such as new town projects emerge in China in recent years, which create an urgent demand for a sustainability assessment tools on the area scale. This research firstly executed a systemic analysis on the Chinese land ownership, urban planning system and residential development process, and an integrated study on the state of sustainable development and green building in China. The research identified the necessary of sustainability assessment on the area scale and discussed the possibility and benefits of the residential district as the assessment scale. Then the research made a comparison and deep analysis of the three existing assessment tool for residential area scale, LEED for Neighborhood Development, BREEAM Communities and CASBEE for Urban Development, and built an initial framework of assessment items respecting the local context of China. And then the initial framework were improved and determined through questionnaires with 60 respondents: 50 % of them were experts and 50 % were laymen. With the help of the software of Expert Choice based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology, the weighting system of the final assessment items was established. The outcome of this research was a suggested Sustainable Residential District (SRD) Rating System (a computer program). With this tool, four residential district developments in China were assessed. The results were used to test its practicability and usefulness and to analyze the sustainability performance of Chinese residential district development. According to the feedback from the involved experts, the suggested assessment tool can assist the participants of residential district development in China to make a general and clearer view of the residential district projects on the sustainability issues and further to improve the overall sustainability performanc...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The spatial {{resolution}} of state-of-the-art {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) sensors enables the structure analysis of urban areas. The appearance of buildings in magnitude images in settlements is dominated by effects of the inherent oblique scene illumination, such as layover, radar shadow and salient lines of bright scattering caused by direct reflection or multipath signal propagation. For example, in <b>urban</b> <b>residential</b> <b>districts</b> often salient pairs of parallel lines of bright magnitude are caused by gable-roofed buildings. The first line (closer to sensor) is due to direct reflection of planar roof parts of small or even zero incidence angle. The second line {{can be related to}} signal caused by a dihedral corner reflector built between ground and building wall. In this paper an approach is presented aiming at reconstruction of gable-roofed buildings by knowledge based analysis considering the mentioned SAR-specific effects. The estimation of building height is carried out by the extracted geometric parameters from the amplitude image. The resulting geometric model ambiguity can be solved by comparing simulated and real interferometric phases at the building location. The reconstruction results are quantitatively assessed by using a high-resolution LIDAR surface model, cadastral data and a orthophoto...|$|R

40|$|Conventional welfare {{production}} is unsustainable. A societal emphasis on (green) economic growth may therefore be superseded by an extended concept of well-being. Taking a transformative approach, science may {{take part in}} catalysing this challenging transformation of both the understanding {{and the level of}} well-being. Instead of economic growth at the expense of sustainability, we aim to cooperatively refocus on integrating economic, social and ecological perspectives into a more holistic, sustainable approach to individual and municipal well-being in Wuppertal (Germany). Therefore, the research team investigates and develops concepts of local sustainable well-being production, e. g., by employing a new indicator system and the real-world laboratory approach. What are the conditions and constraints of transforming well-being in Wuppertal and most particularly of the role of scientists in this endeavour? Answering this research question with a comparative case study approach, we have analysed our resources, processes, contexts and normativity. The results show that the role of ‘transformative scientists’ in Wuppertal faces constraints of timing and funding, as well as challenges from the different demands of science and practice. Hampered co-design interacts with role conflicts. Open-minded stakeholders are crucial for local well-being transformation, as is the awareness that <b>urban</b> <b>residential</b> <b>districts</b> have bottomed out.

40|$|Because of its {{independence}} of {{time of day}} and its all weather capability, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has become a key remote sensing technique in the last decades. In the past, spatial resolution of space borne SAR systems was rather coarse, so the exploitation of building signature and even the reconstruction of buildings in dense urban areas based on InSAR data was restricted to commercial and modern experimental airborne SAR systems. These are capable of providing single pass InSAR data with spatial resolution well below half a meter and much better. Now, {{the new generation of}} space borne SAR satellites (e. g. TerraSAR-X, RADARSAT- 2, or COSMO-SkyMed) allows a more detailed analysis at the object level even for urban areas. This gives rise to the question: Is it possible to transfer basic algorithms of building reconstruction based on airborne sensors to such data? Because of the high availability and short repeat time of the space borne sensors, they are particularly useful e. g. in case of disaster management. In this paper a known algorithm of gable-roofed building reconstruction is applied to airborne and space borne InSAR data of the same test site. The algorithm exploits the appearance of buildings in magnitude images, which is dominated by effects of the inherent oblique scene illumination, such as layover, radar shadow and salient lines of bright scattering caused by direct reflection or multipath signal propagation. Especially, in <b>urban</b> <b>residential</b> <b>districts</b> often salient pairs of parallel lines of bright magnitude are caused by gable-roofed buildings. By exploitation of this magnitude signature, building hypotheses are assembled.

Data was collected through in-depth interviews (indepth interviews) and observations, then the data that has been obtained qualitatively analyzed. The results showed that the Client Patron relationship between pimps and prostitutes is motivated by the need to make life as a pimp and prostitute patron needs workers also need work. The relationship between them begins with a relationship without a written agreement, but based on mutual trust of each party. As a patron, the pimp has a function as an intermediary or dealer to the customer, arrange the working systems and as head of the family, accompanied by PSK function as a facilitator in the business world of prostitution.

While {{necessary}} for traffic, they are no more than 2 ̆ 2 no-man 2 ̆ 7 s land owned by an impersonal government. 2 ̆ 2 As an alternative to a through-street system, some architects have proposed a cul-de-sac street system and made many claims about its impacts on the daily lives of people. Their claims were diffuse and they provided little evidence of their efficacy. ^ In examining the effects of street layouts, this study employs the disciplines of architecture and environmental psychology. This study discusses types of street layouts based on the architectural theories of type and space and comments on the limitations of architectural discourses. Based on the findings of environmental psychology, this study establishes a model of territorial performance, and hypothesizes that cul-de-sacs are perceived to be more exclusively and peacefully used, safer, conducive to greater social cohesion, and better maintained than through-streets. ^ The validity of the hypotheses was tested by the data obtained through a questionnaire survey and systematic observations at ten streets in four inner-city, middle-income, ethnically homogeneous, row-house areas in Philadelphia. Statistical analysis of the data revealed that the cul-de-sac residents are more inclined than through-street residents to feel that: (1) they use the streets exclusively and peacefully; (2) their homes are secure and their children 2 ̆ 7 s play is safe; (3) they distinguish between their neighbors and outsiders; and (4) the streets are well maintained. The claims that cul-de-sacs promote neighborhood interaction and maintenance responsibility are not so strong as one might expect from past research or theories. ^ Based on the findings, this study suggests that cul-de-sacs be provided for the enhanced territorial control of street areas by the residents. It also proposes guidelines which can be used in the design of inner-city residential blocks. The guidelines are applied to prototypical design examples and to existing residential blocks in an inner-city area of Philadelphia. In the application of the guidelines to other population groups and locations, it must be remembered that the architectural environment is not the only determinant of socio-behavioral consequences. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} solve the problem of {{automatic}} detection of artificial objects in high resolution remote sensing images, a method for detection of artificial areas in high resolution remote sensing images based on multi-scale and multi feature fusion is proposed. Firstly, the geometric features such as corner, straight line and right angle are extracted from the original resolution, and the pseudo corner points, pseudo linear features and pseudo orthogonal angles are filtered out by the self-constraint and mutual restraint between them. Then the radiation intensity map of the image with high geometric characteristics is obtained by the linear inverse distance weighted method. Secondly, the original image is reduced to multiple scales and the visual saliency image of each scale is obtained by adaptive weighting of the orthogonal saliency, the local brightness and contrast which are calculated at the corresponding scale. Then the final visual saliency image is obtained by fusing all scales’ visual saliency images. Thirdly, the visual saliency images of artificial areas based on multi scales and multi features are obtained by fusing the geometric feature energy intensity map and visual saliency image obtained in previous decision level. Finally, the artificial areas can be segmented based on the method called OTSU.

Unfortunately, many landscape architects, urban designers, and city planners currently re-frame from using such gaming technology capable of creating 3 D interactive visualizations (Deane, 2015 a). Many firms use verbal descriptions with images. This method is insufficient for facilitating feedback (Bratteteig & Wagner, 2010; Gordon, et al, 2010; Stakeholder Engagement, 2009; Zhang, 2004). According to Lange and Bishop (2005) {{there is no}} reason why real-time visualizations should not be used in urban design.
