40|$|In 1989, the American Library Association {{published}} the well-known Final Report of the Presidential Committee on Information Literacy. Since then, the information-developed world has seen numerous activities for <b>upgrading</b> <b>information</b> literacy {{at all levels}} of education, in the economy and in everyday life. Efficient use of knowledge in society is strongly emphasized and, linked to that, the importance of education and training of information users, as well as the <b>upgrading</b> of <b>information</b> literacy, especially in the context of higher education. Information literacy is increasingly recognized as a basic skill in the process of learning and adapting to the changing living and working environment of today’s information society. Students face dilemmas in the selection of information resources and challenges for their efficient and responsible use on a daily basis. Academic libraries respond to this challenge by offering different information literacy programmes.

40|$|Governments {{are making}} it a {{priority}} to <b>upgrade</b> <b>information</b> and communication technologies (ICT) with the aim to increase available internet connection speeds. This paper presents a new empirical strategy to estimate the causal effects of these policies, and applies it to the questions of whether and how ICT upgrades affect educational attainment. We draw on a rich collection of microdata {{that allows us to}} link administrative test score records for the population of English primary and secondary school students to the available ICT at their home addresses. To base estimations on exogenous variation in ICT, we notice that the boundaries of usually invisible telephone exchange station catchment areas give rise to substantial and essentially randomly placed jumps in the available ICT across neighboring residences. Using this design across more than 20, 000 boundaries in England, we find that even very large changes in available broadband connection speeds have a precisely estimated zero effect on educational attainment. Guided by a simple model we then bring to bear additional microdata on student time and internet use to quantify the potentially opposing mechanisms underlying the zero reduced form effect. While jumps in the available ICT appear to increase student consumption of online content, we find no significant effects on student time spent studying online or offline, or on their learning productivity...|$|E
40|$|In high-confinement (H-mode) plasmas with edge {{localized}} modes (ELMs), {{the energy}} stored {{at the edge}} pedestal region directly affects the global plasma confinement. The measurement of the edge pedestal evolution {{and the study of}} the collapse mechanism of the pedestal structure due to ELMs is, therefore, of great importance to understand plasma confinement. In Axially Symmetric Divertor Experiment (ASDEX) <b>Upgrade,</b> <b>information</b> about the edge density profile has been obtained in H-mode plasmas both with Thomson scattering and by combining lithium beam and interferometry measurements. However, information around the edge pedestal region is not routinely available. Here we use microwave reflectometry to obtain high resolution measurements of the edge transport barrier and pedestal region, namely the pedestal position and density, the pedestal width, and the edge density gradient. The evolution of the pedestal density is obtained automatically with an algorithm applied directly to the group delay. The other parameters are derived from the corresponding density profiles. Measurements performed in the presence of type I ELMs reveal that the edge density profile modifications occur in the same time scale of the Dα radiation at the divertor. The collapse and recovery of the pedestal structure during each ELM is resolved. The values of the pedestal width (around 4 – 5 cm) measured in-between ELMs are similar to those obtained previously in similar ASDEX Upgrade discharges. Also, the evolution of the pedestal density given by reflectometry is found to be in good agreement with the changes of the line integrated density measured by the interferometer...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this thesis}} are (i) to {{identify}} {{problems in the}} area of information management that affect the Malaysian Inland Revenue Department (MIRD), and (ii) to propose a way forward for dealing with them. The problem-identification part of the project triangulates data obtained from documentary analysis, observation in the MIRD, and interviews with three groups of stakeholders: management, employees and the public. The MIRD's activities are found to be characterised by conflicting views over government bureaucratic, management-cultural and legal issues, and by coercion in the form of racism. In addition, a substantial - section of the Muslim population disagrees with the whole concept of the secular concept of tax-paying, preferring to pay a religious levy. These problems are adversely affecting public perception of the MIRD, resulting in loss of cooperation. However, hope for improvement is provided by senior management's commitment to change, an ongoing project to <b>upgrade</b> <b>information</b> management, and the existence of mechanisms for communication which can be developed. As a result of the analysis of problems, the researcher has devised a new Information Management Model, the Participative Information Management Model (PIM) which, it is argued, could help improve the situation. The model draws heavily on Ackoff's methodology of Interactive Planning, but the approach is modified by the inclusion of measures for addressing, prior to enactment, the problems of coercion which would frustrate participation. By improving communication and participation within the MIRD, and between the MIPD and the public and the Federal government, it is hoped that a situation can be created in which most of the issues currently confronting the MIRD will be capable of solution by the stakeholders themselves...|$|E

This paper proposes a new empirical methodology to estimate the causal effect of these policies, and applies it {{to the question of how}} upgrades in ICT affect educational attainment. We draw on a new and unique collection of UK microdata that allows us for the first time to link administrative test score records for the population of English primary and secondary school students to the available ICT at their home addresses. To base estimations on exogenous variation in ICT, we notice that capacity constraints at telephone exchange stations lead to invisible and essentially randomly placed boundaries of station-level catchment areas that give rise to substantial and discontinuous jumps in the available ICT across space. Using this design across more than 20 thousand boundary segments in England, we find that even very large changes in available internet connection speeds have a precisely estimated zero effect on educational attainment, and that the estimates are causally identified: house prices, student socioeconomic characteristics and local amenities are flat across the boundaries. Guided by a simple theoretical framework we then bring to bear additional microdata on student time use and internet use to quantify the microeconomic channels underlying the zero reduced form effect. We find that faster connection speeds lead to a significant increase in student consumption of online content, but do not affect the amount of time spent online or the amount of time spent studying. We conclude that the elasticity of student demand for online content with respect to its per unit time cost is negative but bounded at - 1, and that increased consumption of online content has no effect on learning productivity per unit of time spent studying...|$|E

At the time of the conference, the peak luminosity at Run II is above 7 × 10 31 cm − 2 s − 1 and both CDF and DØ experiments each has collected more than 290 pb − 1 on tapes. Both experiments have run quite stably and the data taking efficiencies are about 80 - 90 %. The results shown here include analyses from the CDF data corresponding to about 65 to 220 pb − 1 and the DØ data corresponding to about 115 to 250 pb − 1. Unlike B factories running at the Υ(4 S) resonance, all hadronic states such as Bs and Λb are produced at the Tevatron that provides unique capabilities for studying these particles and their interactions in near future.

The evidence shows that during the 1990 s China dramatically increased its market shares in ICT products and now ranks among the three top world exporters. Moreover, China has upgraded from mere assembly of imported inputs to the manufacturing of high-tech intermediate goods. This supports the hypothesis that industrial upgrading occurred in some tradable sectors through technological learning associated with processing trade. Therefore, a pattern of specialization initially dominated by processing trade could be favourable to a country's long-term development, {{to the extent that}} entering {{at the lower end of}} high-tech sectors is promotive of catching up in more sophisticated technology-intensive production.
