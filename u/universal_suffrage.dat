5|$|Hong Kong's Basic Law, {{implemented}} in the territory on 1 July 1997, consists of outstanding articles which require bill adoption by the Legislative Council before becoming effective laws. Two {{of the most prominent}} articles include Article 23 ("National Security") and <b>universal</b> <b>suffrage</b> of Chief Executive elections. In 2002, the government's motion of an anti-subversion bill pursuant to Article 23, was met with fierce opposition and eventually dropped. Reform bills on <b>universal</b> <b>suffrage,</b> however, have made partial progress in expanding the Chief Executive election's committee (from 600 to 800 in 2007 and to 1,200 selected members in 2012) and the Legislative Council (from 60 to 70 seats). These additional 10 seats are created through directly elected members of District Offices.|$|E

5|$|The Parliament {{challenged}} {{this decision}} splitting their working arrangements, {{declaring that the}} division of its activities between three states was against the treaties and the natural prerogatives of a Parliament elected by direct <b>universal</b> <b>suffrage,</b> claiming {{the right to decide}} its own workings to its own efficiency. In response, leaders annexed the decision to the Treaty of Amsterdam, including it in the treaties.|$|E

The Moderates gained 26.1 percent of the votes, a new record for the party and over 10 percentage points higher than in 2002. The election result was also historic in being the worst result for the Social Democrats ever (34.6 percent) in a general election under <b>universal</b> <b>suffrage</b> (introduced in 1921).|$|E
5|$|Thaddeus Stevens, a Republican {{congressman from}} Pennsylvania and ardent abolitionist, agreed that voting rights should be universal. In 1866, Stanton, Anthony, {{and several other}} suffragists drafted a <b>universal</b> <b>suffrage</b> {{petition}} demanding {{that the right to}} vote be given without consideration of sex or race. The petition was introduced in the United States Congress by Stevens. Despite these efforts, the Fourteenth Amendment was passed, without adjustment, in 1868.|$|E
5|$|A new women's {{suffrage}} {{bill was}} introduced, which the Senate of Argentina sanctioned on 21 August 1946.

Law 13,010 established the equality of political rights between men and women and <b>universal</b> <b>suffrage</b> in Argentina. Finally, Law 13,010 was approved unanimously. In a public celebration and ceremony, however, Juan Perón signed the law granting women the right to vote, and then he handed the bill to Eva, symbolically making it hers.|$|E

5|$|Bulgaria is a {{parliamentary}} democracy {{in which the}} most powerful executive position is that of prime minister. The political system has three branches—legislative, executive and judicial, with <b>universal</b> <b>suffrage</b> for citizens at least 18 years old. The Constitution of Bulgaria provides also possibilities of direct democracy. Elections are supervised by an independent Central Election Commission that includes members from all major political parties. Parties must register with the commission prior to participating in a national election. Normally, the prime minister-elect {{is the leader of}} the party receiving the most votes in parliamentary elections, although this is not always the case.|$|E

Around 1930, Averescu began opposing the <b>universal</b> <b>suffrage</b> he had endorsed earlier, and issued an appeal to the intellectuals in order to have it discarded from legislation on the basis that it was easily influenced by the parties in power. He and his supporter, the pro-authoritarian poet Octavian Goga, received criticism from the left-wing Poporanist journal Viața Românească, who claimed that Averescu had in fact provoked and encouraged widespread electoral irregularities during his time in office.|$|E
5|$|Ho's Viet Minh {{seized power}} {{and set up}} a {{provisional}} government in the wake of Japan's withdrawal from Vietnam. This move violated a prior agreement between the member parties of the Viet Nam Cach Mang Dong Minh Hoi (Vietnamese Revolutionary League), which included the VNQDD as well as the Vietminh, and Ho was pressured to broaden his government's appeal by including the VNQDD (now led by Nguyễn Tường Tam). The Vietminh announced that they would abolish the mandarin governance system and hold national elections with <b>universal</b> <b>suffrage</b> in two hold. The VNQDD objected to this, fearing that the communists would perpetrate electoral fraud.|$|E

5|$|It {{was only}} in 1946, after the Japanese Occupation and the {{disbanding}} of the Straits Settlements, that the people were allowed to elect members into the Legislative Council. The Council then consisted of at least 22 {{but not more than}} 24 members. Only nine members were elected, out of which the Singapore Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the Indian Chamber of Commerce were each allotted one seat. The other six seats were to be filled by democratic elections based on <b>universal</b> <b>suffrage.</b> Elections were held {{for the first time on}} 20 March 1948.|$|E
5|$|Reinfeldt's {{first term}} in office was marked by the late-2000s {{financial}} crisis and recession. His popularity fell until the economy of Sweden {{emerged as one of}} the strongest in Europe; this brought a resurgence of support for him, resulting in his government's re-election in 2010. Despite the Moderate Party getting its highest share of the vote since the introduction of <b>universal</b> <b>suffrage</b> in 1921, Reinfeldt's government was reduced to a minority government, owing to the rise of Sweden Democrats; but he remained in power as the first centre-right Prime Minister since the Swedish-Norwegian Union to be re-elected.|$|E
5|$|Representative {{democracy}} {{began in}} the 1940s {{when the number of}} elected seats in the legislature gradually increased, until a fully elected Legislative Assembly of Singapore was established in 1958. At present, Singapore legislation establishes various mechanisms that fulfil the doctrine of representative democracy. Parliamentary elections in Singapore are required to be held regularly to elect the Parliament through <b>universal</b> <b>suffrage.</b> Although the right to vote in Singapore law is not expressly mentioned in the Constitution, the Government has affirmed that the right may be implied into the constitutional text.|$|E

5|$|The first local {{election}}s, {{based on}} <b>universal</b> <b>suffrage</b> in Finland were held during 17–28 December 1918 {{and the first}} free Parliamentary election after the Civil War on 3 March 1919. The United States and the United Kingdom recognised Finnish sovereignty on 6–7 May 1919. The Western powers demanded establishment of democratic republics in post-war Europe in order to calm down the widespread revolutionary movements in Europe. The Finnish-Russian Treaty of Tartu signed on 14 October 1920 aimed to stabilize the political relations and settle the border line between the former Grand Duchy and its mainland.|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} struggle for democracy was solved outside Finland, via international power politics; the Russian Empire's failed 1904–1905 war against Japan {{led to the}} 1905 Revolution in Russia and to a general strike in Finland. In an attempt to quell the general unrest, the system of estates was abolished in the Parliamentary Reform of 1906, which introduced <b>universal</b> <b>suffrage.</b> The general strike increased support for the Social Democrats substantially, {{as a proportion of}} the population, the party was the most powerful socialist movement in the world.|$|E
5|$|After the LCL lost {{government}} in 1970, primarily {{owing to the}} electoral reform, Hall managed to be re-elected as leader.

When the Dunstan government again introduced a bill to introduce <b>universal</b> <b>suffrage</b> to the council, Hall gained the support of 7 out of 20 members in the Assembly, but only 2 of 16 LCL members in the Legislative Council supported the bill. Internally, there was much opposition to any electoral reform when the matter was debated at party conferences.|$|E
