50|$|ABHD10 was {{identified}} in 2012, {{and only two}} main functions have been reported. First, ABHD10 {{is involved in the}} deglucuronidation of AcMPAG in human liver. The activity of this enzyme could attenuate the AcMAPG formation. AcMAPG might be responsible for some adverse effects of mycophenolate mofetil therapy because it promotes the release of TNF-Î± and IL-6, and it also binds to enzymes that are essential for the control of the energy and redox state of the cells. Thus, the function of ABHD10 could also be regarded as detoxification. Second, ABHD10 counteracts PRAG via deglucuronidation in human liver. As a widely used <b>uricosuric</b> <b>agent,</b> probenecid is mainly metabolized to PRAG, which is a causal substance of severe allergic or anaphylactoid reaction. The PRAG deglucuronidation catalyzed by ABHD10 could suppress PRAG formation and related adverse reaction.|$|E
50|$|Penicillin is {{actively}} excreted, and about 80% of a penicillin dose is cleared {{from the body}} within {{three to four hours}} of administration. Indeed, during the early penicillin era, the drug was so scarce and so highly valued that it became common to collect the urine from patients being treated, so that the penicillin in the urine could be isolated and reused. This was not a satisfactory solution, so researchers looked for a way to slow penicillin excretion. They hoped to find a molecule that could compete with penicillin for the organic acid transporter responsible for excretion, such that the transporter would preferentially excrete the competing molecule and the penicillin would be retained. The <b>uricosuric</b> <b>agent</b> probenecid proved to be suitable. When probenecid and penicillin are administered together, probenecid competitively inhibits the excretion of penicillin, increasing penicillin's concentration and prolonging its activity. Eventually, the advent of mass-production techniques and semi-synthetic penicillins resolved the supply issues, so this use of probenecid declined. Probenecid is still useful, however, for certain infections requiring particularly high concentrations of penicillins.|$|E
40|$|Inhibition of [14 C]-urate uptake by <b>uricosuric</b> and antiuricosuric <b>agents</b> was {{investigated}} in human brush-border membrane vesicles, urate being transported either by anion exchange mechanisms or by voltage sensitive pathway. The IC 50 for drugs on [14 C]-urate uptake in vesicles loaded with 1 mM cold urate or with 5 mM lactate was, respectively: 0. 7 and 0. 3 microM for benzbromarone; 6 and 4 microM for salicylate; 133 and 13 microM for losartan; 520 and 190 microM for sulfinpyrazone and 807 and 150 microM, for probenecid. The IC 50 ratio for [14 C]-urate uptake in exchange for cold urate or for lactate varied from about 1 for salicylate to 10 for losartan, supporting the hypothesis that two distinct anion exchangers are involved in urate transport. Application of Hill equation revealed that urate/anion exchangers {{have more than one}} binding site, possibly two binding sites with high cooperativity, for benzbromarone and sulfinpyrazone, but only one for probenecid, salicylate and losartan. The uricosuric diuretic, tienilic acid was 10 to 50 times more potent than hydrochlorothiazide, chlorothiazide and furosemide, for inhibiting [14 C]-urate uptake in exchange for cold urate. This higher potency is the reason of its uricosuric properties. All <b>uricosuric</b> <b>agents,</b> as well as the antiuricosuric agents, pyrazinoate and ethambutol, had a much lower potency for inhibiting [14 C]-urate uptake through the voltage sensitive pathway (apical secretory step) than through the urate/anion exchangers. This suggests that antiuricosuria, induced by pyrazinoate and ethambutol, as well as by low concentrations of <b>uricosuric</b> <b>agents,</b> does not result from an inhibition of the apical voltage sensitive pathway...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHyperuricemia {{has been}} shown to be {{associated}} with ventricular arrhythmias. However, the mechanisms remained unknown. We assessed whether different urate-lowering agents can attenuate arrhythmias through lowering urate itself or inhibiting xanthenes oxidize (XO) activity in infarcted rats. Male Wistar rats after ligating coronary artery were randomized to either allopurinol, or febuxostat, chemically unrelated inhibitors of XO, benzbromarone or vehicle for 4 weeks. Post-infarction was associated with increased oxidant stress, as measured by myocardial superoxide, isoprostane, XO activity and dihydroethidine fluorescence staining. Measurement of myocardial norepinephrine levels revealed a significant elevation in vehicle-treated infarcted rats compared with sham-operated rats. Sympathetic hyperinnervation was blunted after administering both XO inhibitors, assessed by immunofluorescent analysis, Western blotting and real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Besides, the XO inhibitors-attenuated nerve growth factor levels were reversed in the presence of peroxynitrite generator. Arrhythmic scores in the XO inhibitors-treated infarcted rats were significantly lower than that in vehicle. For similar levels of urate lowering, the <b>uricosuric</b> <b>agent</b> benzbromarone had no beneficial effects on oxidative stress, sympathetic hyperinnervation or arrhythmia vulnerability.

Assuming that PZA selectively inhibits the tubular secretion of urate and that <b>uricosuric</b> <b>agents</b> act by increasing the excretion of filtered urate, then the uricosuric responses (the increment in urate excretion or clearance) should have been unaffected by PZA. Defined in this manner, however, uricosuric responses to probenecid and chlorothiazide were significantly decreased after PZA pretreatment. In order to determine whether PZA diminished other renal actions of chlorothiazide, changes in sodium and inorganic phosphorus excretion were examined. Chlorothiazide produced equivalent natriuretic and phosphaturic responses after PZA pretreatment, indicating that PZA does not interfere with {{at least some of}} the renal actions of chlorothiazide.

Uric acid is the end product of purine metabolism in humans because the gene encoding uricase was lost during hominoid evolution. Pegloticase is a recombinant mammalian uricase conjugated to polyethylene glycol that catalyzes the oxidation of uric acid into allantoin, a more soluble end product. The use of this drug as urate-lowering therapy is a new approach in treating severe gout refractory to conventional therapy with xanthine oxidase inhibitors and <b>uricosuric</b> <b>agents.</b> Intravenous pegloticase has potent and long-lasting urate-lowering capacity with rapid efficacy on tophi resolution. However, pegloticase treatment is associated with infusion-related reactions despite prevention therapy with high-dose corticosteroids.

40|$|The <b>uricosuric</b> <b>agent</b> {{probenecid}} is co-administered {{with the}} dopaminergic neurotoxin MPTP {{to produce a}} chronic mouse model of Parkinson's disease. It has been proposed that probenecid serves to elevate concentrations of MPTP in the brain by reducing renal elimination of the toxin. However, this mechanism has never been formally demonstrated to date and is questioned by our previous data showing that intracerebral concentrations of MPP(+), the active metabolite of MPTP, are not modified by co-injection of probenecid. In this study, we investigated the potentiating effects of probenecid in vivo and in vitro arguing against the possibility of altered metabolism or impaired renal elimination of MPTP. We find that probenecid (i) is toxic in itself to several neuronal populations apart from dopaminergic neurons, and (ii) that it also potentiates the effects of other mitochondrial complex I inhibitors such as rotenone. On a mechanistic level, we show that probenecid is able to lower intracellular ATP concentrations and that its toxic action on neuronal cells can be reversed by extracellular ATP. Probenecid can potentiate the effect of mitochondrial toxins due to its impact on ATP metabolism and could therefore be useful to model atypical parkinsonian syndromes...|$|E

40|$|Gout is {{a common}} form of {{inflammatory}} arthritis caused by deposition of monosodium urate crystals. The central strategy for effective long-term management of gout is serum urate lowering. Current urate-lowering drugs include both xanthine oxidase inhibitors and <b>uricosuric</b> <b>agents.</b> Lesinurad is a URAT 1 inhibitor that selectively inhibits urate rebsorption at the proximal renal tubule. Lesinurad 200 mg daily in combination with a xanthine oxidase is approved for urate-lowering therapy in patients with gout. Areas covered: The published literature was searched using Pubmed and additional information was obtained from publically available regulatory documents. Pre-clinical data and clinical trials of lesinurad are described. Serum urate-lowering efficacy and effects on other clinical endpoints are discussed. Adverse event data, focusing on renal safety are also presented. Expert opinion: Lesinurad is an effective urate-lowering drug that has a generally acceptable safety profile when used at 200 mg daily dosing in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor.

Within this overarching aim, a second aim was to evaluate the evidence for a new <b>uricosuric</b> <b>agent</b> lesinurad, which inhibits urate transport in the kidney. In summary, this review indicates {{that there are a}} number of ways to approach patients who do not achieve a target serum urate with allopurinol (APL) monotherapy. These include higher doses of APL up to 600 â 800 mg/d, switching to febuxostat, or adding in a uricosuric. For the latter option, controlled supporting evidence is available for benzbromarone, probenecid, and lesinurad. All options appear similar in terms of success rates, so the choice of option comes down to physician and patient choice, cost, experience, and strength of the evidence base. Increasing the dose of APL is the cheapest option, while febuxostat is consistently superior to standard doses of APL. The strongest evidence for the uricosuric option is available for lesinurad as trials of other agents are either nonexistent or based on small single-centre trials. It is suggested that guidelines should be expanded to consider all of these evidence-based options in the not-uncommon occurrence of APL inadequate response.

The aims {{of this study}} were to determine the acute effects of milk ingestion on serum urate concentrations and examine the mechanisms of these effects. Methods This was a short-term randomised controlled crossover trial of milk in 16 healthy male volunteers. The following products were tested (each 80 g protein) : soy control, early season skim milk, late season skim milk (containing high concentrations of orotic acid, a naturally occurring <b>uricosuric</b> <b>agent)</b> and ultrafi ltrated MPC 85 skim milk. Each participant received a single dose of each product in random order. Serum and urine were obtained immediately before and then hourly over a 3 h period after ingestion of each study product. Results Ingestion of the soy control led to an increase in serum urate concentrations by approximately 10 %. In contrast, ingestion of all milks led to a decrease in serum urate concentrations by approximately 10 % (p< 0. 0001). All products (including soy) rapidly increased the fractional excretion of uric acid (FEUA). Late season milk led to a greater increase in FEUA than MPC 85 (p= 0. 02) and early season milk (p= 0. 052). There were no differences over time in serum oxypurines or purine-containing nucleosides. However, all products increased the fractional excretion of xanthine. Conclusions Intact milk has an acute urate-lowering effect.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{review the}} epidemiology, pathophysiology, {{clinical}} manifestations, diagnosis, {{and treatment of}} gouty arthritis of the hand and wrist, {{with a focus on}} the surgical aspects. DATA SOURCES AND EXTRACTION: Electronic databases including MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane library were searched with the key words of 'gouty arthritis', 'hand', 'wrist', and 'surgical'. STUDY SELECTION: A total of 55 articles were selected for inclusion in this review. DATA SYNTHESIS: There is no existing study for the overall prevalence of gout in Asia, though one study showed that it was 3. 1 % in Taiwan. Its pathophysiology entails hyperuricaemia, trauma, lower temperatures, and previous diseases. Gouty arthritis of hand and wrist presents as acute wrist pain, subcutaneous or peritendinous tophi, tenosynovitis, entrapment neuropathy, tendon rupture, or even bone destruction. Demonstration of negatively birefringent crystals in the absence of organisms and a normal white cell count in synovial fluid confirm the diagnosis. Medical treatment including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicines, allopurinol, <b>uricosuric</b> <b>agents,</b> and lifestyle modifications remain the mainstay of treatment. Surgical treatment options for tophaceous gout involve decompression by aspiration, incision and drainage, tenosynovectomy, shaving procedures, and complex surgical approach. CONCLUSION. While medical treatment remains the mainstay of treatment for gouty arthritis of the hand and wrist, 5 % of patients may not respond. In this group, surgery is often performed in advanced stages, but yields less-than-satisfactory outcomes. Gouty arthritis is difficult to treat when it starts to cause stiffness and deformities. Although more studies are needed to evaluate the outcomes, the authors suggest that one possible solution is pre-emptive surgery. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

Some transport properties of human GLUT 9 have been studied in the Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system, but the type of transport (uniport, coupled transport system, stoichiometry [...] ..) is still largely unknown. We used the same experimental system to characterize in more detail the transport properties of mouse GLUT 9, its sensitivity to several uricosuric drugs, and the specificities of two splice variants, mGLUT 9 a and mGLUT 9 b. [(14) C]urate uptake measurements show that both splice variants are high-capacity urate transporters and have a K(m) of approximately 650 microM. The well-known <b>uricosuric</b> <b>agents</b> benzbromarone (500 microM) and losartan (1 mM) inhibit GLUT 9 -mediated urate uptake by 90 and 50 %, respectively. Surprisingly, phloretin, a glucose-transporter blocker, inhibits [(14) C]urate uptake by approximately 50 % at 1 mM. Electrophysiological measurements suggest that urate transport by mouse GLUT 9 is electrogenic and voltage dependent, but independent of the Na(+) and Cl(-) transmembrane gradients. Taken together, our results suggest that GLUT 9 works as a urate (anion) uniporter. Finally, we show by RT-PCR performed on RNA from mouse kidney microdissected tubules that GLUT 9 a is expressed at low levels in proximal tubules, while GLUT 9 b is specifically expressed in distal convoluted and connecting tubules. Expression of mouse GLUT 9 in the kidney {{differs from that of}} human GLUT 9, which could account for species differences in urate handling...|$|R
40|$|Eyes Absents (EYA) are {{multifunctional}} proteins {{best known}} for their role in organogenesis. There is accumulating evidence that overexpression of EYAs in breast and ovarian cancers, and in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, correlates with tumor growth and increased metastasis. The EYA protein is both a transcriptional activator and a tyrosine phosphatase, and the tyrosine phosphatase activity promotes single cell motility of mammary epithelial cells. Since EYAs are expressed in vascular endothelial cells and cell motility is a critical feature of angiogenesis we investigated the role of EYAs in this process. Using RNA interference techniques we show that EYA 3 depletion in human umbilical vein endothelial cells inhibits transwell migration as well as Matrigel-induced tube formation. To specifically query {{the role of the}} EYA tyrosine phosphatase activity we employed a chemical biology approach. Through an experimental screen the <b>uricosuric</b> <b>agents</b> Benzbromarone and Benzarone were found to be potent EYA inhibitors, and Benzarone in particular exhibited selectivity towards EYA versus a representative classical protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTP 1 B. These compounds inhibit the motility of mammary epithelial cells over-expressing EYA 2 as well as the motility of endothelial cells. Furthermore, they attenuate tubulogenesis in matrigel and sprouting angiogenesis in the ex vivo aortic ring assay in a dose-dependent fashion. The anti-angiogenic effect of the inhibitors was also demonstrated in vivo, as treatment of zebrafish embryos led to significant and dose-dependent defects in the developing vasculature. Taken together our results demonstrate that the EYA tyrosine phosphatase activity is pro-angiogenic and that Benzbromarone and Benzarone are attractive candidates for repurposing as drugs for the treatment of cancer metastasis, tumor angiogenesis, and vasculopathies...|$|R
40|$|Probenecid, {{a widely}} used <b>uricosuric</b> <b>agent,</b> is mainly metabolized to {{probenecid}} acyl glucuronide (PRAG), {{which is considered}} a causal substance of severe allergic or anaphylactoid reactions. PRAG can be hydrolyzed (deglucuronidated) to probenecid. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify enzymes responsible for probenecid acyl glucuronidation and PRAG deglucuronidation in human livers and to examine the effect of deglucuronidation in PRAG formation. In human liver homogenates (HLHs), the intrinsic clearance (CLint) of PRAG deglucuronidation was much greater (497 -fold) than that of probenecid acyl glucuronidation. Evaluation of PRAG formation by recombinant UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isoforms and an inhibition study using HLHs as an enzyme source demonstrated that multiple UGT isoforms, includingUGT 1 A 1, UGT 1 A 9, andUGT 2 B 7, catalyzed probenecid acyl glucuronidation. We found that recombinant a/b hydrolase domain containing 10 (ABHD 10) substantially catalyzed PRAG deglucuronidation activity, whereas carboxylesterases did not. Similar inhibitory patterns by chemicals between HLHs and recombinant ABHD 10 supported the major contribution of ABHD 10 to PRAG deglucuronidation in human liver. Interestingly, it was demonstrated that the CLint value of probenecid acyl glucuronidation in HLHs was increased by 1. 7 -fold in the presence of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, which potently inhibited ABHD 10 activity. In conclusion, we found that PRAGdeglucuronidation catalyzed by ABHD 10 suppressively regulates PRAG formation via multiple UGT enzymes in human liver. The balance of activities by these enzymes is important for the formation of PRAG, which may be associated with the adverse reactions observed after probenecid administration...|$|E

Methods and ResultsâTwo randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover studies were performed for 1 month on patients with New York Heart Association Class IIâIII chronic heart failure, comparing 300 mg allopurinol, 600 mg allopurinol, and placebo for the first study and 1000 mg probenecid versus placebo in the second study. Endothelial function was assessed by standard forearm venous occlusion plethysmography. Allopurinol 600 mg/d significantly increased forearm blood flow response to acetylcholine compared with both allopurinol 300 mg/d and placebo (% change in forearm blood flow [meanSEM]: 240. 3138. 19 % versus 152. 1018. 21 % versus 73. 9610. 29 %, P 0. 001). For similar levels of urate lowering, the <b>uricosuric</b> <b>agent</b> probenecid had no effect on endothelial function. Sodium nitroprusside response was unchanged by all treatments. Vitamin C and acetylcholine coinfusion data showed that 600 mg/d allopurinol completely abolished the oxidative stress that was sensitive to high-dose vitamin C. ConclusionsâFor the first time, we have shown that a steep doseâresponse relationship exists between allopurinol and its effect on endothelial function. We also showed that the mechanism of improvement in endothelial function with allopurinol lies in its ability to reduce vascular oxidative stress and not in urate reduction. The reduction in vascular oxidative stress was profound because high-dose allopurinol totally abolished the oxidative stress that was sensitive t...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} {{research}} work, drug PRBENECID an anti-gout drug called as a prototypical <b>URICOSURIC</b> <b>agent</b> was selected for preparation of controlled release microspheres. Polymers sodium alginate and Methocel K 100 was used as release retarding agents and to prolong the release of drug in a predetermined time rate of release. To attain the objectives of present work an attempt of formulation was made from trial T 1 -T 5 using sodium alginate and from trial T 6 -T 10 using Methocel K 100. Micrometric properties bulk density, tapped density, angle of repose and Hausnerâs ratio {{was found to be}} satisfactory in trial T 5 with sodium alginate and more in T 10 with Methocel K 100 as T 5 - 1. 35, 0. 76, 29. 46 and 1. 03 : T 10 - 1. 83, 0. 59, 35. 65 and 1. 21. Comparative drug release was performed from T 1 -T 5 and T 6 -T 10 of which trial T 10 was optimized based on drug release and rate of release of the drug from the microspheres were determined by placing the values in various kinetic models and the rate of release was conformed based on the regression coefficient R 2 value of various kinetic models as to be followed in the order of 0. 969 KORESMEYER PEPPAS PLOT> 0. 887 HIGUCHIS MODEL> 0. 886 FIRST ORDER> 0. 796 ZERO ORDER.

40|$|Urate {{transport}} via human PAH transporter hOAT 1 and its gene structure. BackgroundWe recently cloned {{the human}} organic anion transporter 1 (hOAT 1) as a p-aminohippurate (PAH) transporter. Whether urate is transported by the PAH transporter in humans remains unclear. Familial juvenile gouty nephropathy (FJGN) {{is thought to}} develop {{as a result of}} an abnormality in the urate transporter. MethodsTo determine if hOAT 1 transported urate, the cellular uptakes of PAH and urate were determined, as were the inhibition profiles of inorganic anions, and <b>uricosuric</b> and antiuricosuric <b>agents</b> using a mouse S 2 cell line expressing hOAT 1. The hOAT 1 gene was cloned from a genomic library using full-length hOAT 1 - 1 cDNA as a probe. The coding regions of the hOAT 1 genes of two sisters with FJGN were sequenced. Also, immunohistochemical fluorescence analysis of hOAT 1 in the kidney of the younger sister with FJGN was performed. ResultsThe Km and Vmax values of urate transport via hOAT 1 were 943 Â± 84 Î¼mol/L and 1286 Â± 162 pmol/mg protein/min, respectively. The order of the IC 50 of urate transport via hOAT 1 was benzbromarone < probenecid < salicylate or pyrazine carboxylic acid. The 10. 9 kb hOAT 1 gene was found to be interrupted by nine introns. Mutations in the coding region of the hOAT 1 gene from the two sisters with FJGN were undetectable. Immunohistochemical fluorescent staining showed that hOAT 1 in the kidney of the younger sister was similar to that of control individuals. ConclusionsOur data show that hOAT 1 transports urate, and the inhibition profiles of <b>uricosuric</b> and antiuricosuric <b>agents</b> are defined. hOAT 1 is not responsible for FJGN in the two sisters examined in this study...|$|R
40|$|Inhibition of [14 C]-urate uptake by <b>uricosuric</b> and antiuricosuric <b>agents</b> was {{investigated}} in human brush-border membrane vesicles, urate being transported either by anion exchange mechanisms or by voltage sensitive pathway. The IC 50 for drugs on [14 C]-urate uptake in vesicles loaded with 1 mM cold urate or with 5 mM lactate was, respectively: 0. 7 and 0. 3 mM for benzbromarone; 6 and 4 mM for salicylate; 133 and 13 mM for losartan; 520 and 190 mM for sulfinpyrazone and 807 and 150 mM, for probenecid. The IC 50 ratio for [14 C]-urate uptake in exchange for cold urate or for lactate varied from about 1 for salicylate to 10 for losartan, supporting the hypothesis that two distinct anion exchangers are involved in urate transport. Ap-plication of Hill equation revealed that urate/anion exchanger...|$|R
40|$|Objective Xanthine oxidase is {{a highly}} {{versatile}} enzyme that is widely distributed among different species. The hydroxylation of purines is catalysed by xanthine oxidase and especially the conversion of xanthine to uric acid. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors are much useful, since they possess lesser side effects compared to <b>uricosuric</b> and anti-inflammatory <b>agents.</b> The present study deals with in silico and in vitro xanthine oxidase inhibitory analysis of commercially available terpenoids (bisabolol, ÃÂ²-caryophyllene, limonene, and ÃÂ±- terpinene). Methods Molecular docking studies were performed using AutoDock 4. 2 and in vitro xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity was carried out using xanthine as the substrate. In addition, enzyme kinetics was performed using Lineweaver Burkplot analysis. Allopurinol, a known xanthine oxidase inhibitor {{was used as the}} standard. Results The results revealed that bisabolol exhibited a lowest binding energy value of about - 7. 33 kcal/mol. All other compounds showed binding energy values ranging between - 7. 33 to - 5. 87 kcal/mol which was less than the standard (- 4. 78 kcal/mol). In the xanthine oxidase assay, IC 50 value of bisabolol was found to be 34. 70 ÃÂµg/ml, whereas that of allopurinol was 8. 48 ÃÂµg/ml. All the remaining compounds exhibited IC 50 values ranging between 34. 70 to 68. 45 ÃÂµg/ml. ÃÂ  In the enzyme kinetic studies, bisabolol, ÃÂ²-caryophyllene showed non competitive and Limonene, ÃÂ±- terpinene and allopurinol showed competitive type of enzyme inhibition. Conclusion It can be concluded that terpenoids could be a promising remedy for the treatment of gout and related inflammatory disorders. Further in vivo studies are required to develop potential compounds with lesser side effects. </p...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown an {{association}} between gout and/or hyperuricemia and a subsequent increase in cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. Allopurinol reduces vascular oxidative stress, ameliorates inflammatory state, improves endothelial function, and prevents atherosclerosis progression. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that a positive association between allopurinol therapy in gout patients and future cardiovascular outcomes is present using a population-based matched-cohort study design. Patients aged â¥ 40 years with newly diagnosed gout having no pre-existing severe form of CVD were separated into allopurinol (nâ=â 2483) and non-allopurinol (nâ=â 2483) groups after matching for age, gender, index date, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. The two groups were also balanced in terms of uric acid nephrolithiasis, acute kidney injury, hepatitis, and Charlson comorbidity index. With a median follow-up time of 5. 25 years, the allopurinol group had a modest increase in cardiovascular risk [relative risk, 1. 20; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 08 - 1. 34]. A Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for chronic kidney disease, uremia, and gastric ulcer gave a hazard ratio (HR) for cardiovascular outcomes of 1. 25 (95 % CI, 1. 10 - 1. 41) in gout patients receiving allopurinol compared with the non-allopurinol group. In further analysis of patients receiving urate-lowering therapy, the <b>uricosuric</b> <b>agent</b> group (nâ=â 1713) had an adjusted HR of 0. 83 (0. 73 - 0. 95) for cardiovascular events compared with the allopurinol group. The current population-based matched-cohort study {{did not support the}} association between allopurinol therapy in gout patients with normal risk for cardiovascular sequels and beneficial future cardiovascular outcomes. Several important risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index, blood pressure were not obtainable in the current retrospective cohort study, thus could potentially bias the effect estimate...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{asymptomatic}} hyperuratemia (HUA), gout paroxysm {{in patients}} with chronic hyperuratemia (HU) and normouricemic attacks of gouty arthritis are well known, but poorly understood. A review of the current literature with attempt of its explanation is presented. The natural course of gout is associated with joint structure changes that may be evaluated by different imaging techniques; comparative advantages and shortcomings of each technique are presented. For almost over 50 years the market has not offered new drugs for the control of HU and gout, while management of such patients was a rather neglected field. Over {{the last five years}} an unpredictable number of prospective clinical studies have been conducted involving the investigation of the efficacy and safety of new drugs to control HU (febuxostat, pegloticase). The return of pharmaceutical industry into the world of gout has considerably changed the picture. New recommendations have been presented on appropriate colchicine dose regime for acute gouty flares. Emerging therapies, including pegloticase, <b>uricosuric</b> <b>agent</b> RDEA 596 and the interleukin - 1 inhibitors have shown promises in early and late phase clinical trials. Each of them deserves to be considered for implementation and feasibility in clinical practice as well as outcome measures for clinical trials. Another purpose of this review was to summarize new knowledge on approved drugs to treat hyperuricemia, or the clinical manifestations of gout. Results of several clinical trials provide new data on the efficacy and safety of the approved urate lowering drugs (allopurinol and febuxostat). Lifestyle and dietary recommendations for gout patients should take into consideration overall health benefits and risks, since gout is often associated with metabolic syndrome and an increased future risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. This review also summarizes the recent data about lifestyle factors that influence serum uric acid levels and the gout risk, and attempts to provide holistic recommendations, considering both their impact on gout as well as on other health implications...|$|E
