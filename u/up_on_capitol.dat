The number of annual visitors to the Capitol has tripled from 1,000,000 in 1970 to nearly 3,000,000 as of recent times, and it has become difficult to deal with the congestion caused by such crowds. In the past, visitors were required to line <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the <b>Capitol's</b> east stairs, sometimes stretching all the way to 1st Street East. This wait could last hours and no protection was offered against inclement weather. Tickets were not timed and were on a first-come, first-served basis.|$|R

5000|$|Horace Fisher, the aide-de-camp to the Union {{commander}} in the city, Brigadier General William [...] "Bull" [...] Nelson, wrote that: [...] "A stout, middle-aged man, with hair well shot with gray, short in stature, broad in shoulder, and with a roll in his gait, came forward and asked, 'Who is the General in command? I wish to see him.'" [...] Introducing himself as a sea captain and Unionist, Driver brought the coverlet with him. Fisher recalled: [...] "Capt. Driver - an honest-looking, blunt-speaking man, was evidently a character; he carried on his arm a calico-covered bedquilt; and, when satisfied that Gen. Nelson was the officer in command, {{he pulled out his}} jack-knife and began to rip open the bedquilt without another word. We were puzzled to think what his conduct meant. ... Then, the bedquilt was safely delivered of a large American flag, which he handed to Gen. Nelson, saying, 'This is the flag I hope to see hoisted on that flagstaff in place of the d - d Confederate flag set there by that d - d rebel governor, Isham G. Harris. I have had hard work to save it; my house has been searched for it more than once.' He spoke triumphantly, with tears in his eyes." [...] Nelson accepted the flag and ordered it run <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the <b>Capitol</b> flagstaff, accompanied by [...] "frantic cheering and uproarious demonstrations." [...] The 6th Ohio later adopted the motto [...] "Old Glory." ...|$|R
