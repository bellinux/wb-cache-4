40|$|Introduction: <b>Ularitide</b> is a {{synthetic}} form of renally derived natriuretic peptide (NP), urodilatin. Omapatrilat (OMA) is a Vasopeptidase inhibitor (VPI), acting by dual inhibition of both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase 24. 11 (NEP), which degrades the NPs. <b>Ularitide</b> and OMA underwent evaluation {{for the management}} of hypertension and heart failure (HF). Aim: This study aimed to address the effect of <b>ularitide</b> and OMA in aortocaval fistula (ACF) –induced congestive heart failure (CHF) in rats under various conditions of compensation (of clinical severity). Experimental protocol: Volume-overload CHF was induced in male albino rats by creating an infrarenal ACF. One week after fistula induction, ACF rats were randomized to compensated (Com) and decompensated (Decom) ACF groups and each further subdivided into ACF, <b>ularitide</b> and OMA/ularitide treated ACF groups. Sham was used as control. All treatment protocols were started one week after infrarenal ACF induction and continued for further two weeks. Three weeks after shunt induction, all animals were underwent assessment of cardiorenal and humoral functions. Renal outcome was measured by glomerular filtration rate (GFR), fractional excretion of sodium (FNa), absolute urinary sodium excretion (UNaV), urine volume, plasma cystin C level and urinary cyclic 3 ′, 5 ′-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). The humoral function was assessed by plasma renin activity (PRA), angiotensin II (Ang II), Aldosterone, and cGMP. Cardiac outcome was assessed by plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), N-terminal pro–brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) while total and relative heart, lung and liver weights were recorded. Results: Induction of AC shunt was associated with deteriorated renal and excretory functions, activation of renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), elevated ANP with renal resistance to ANP, (NT-proBNP) and (cTnT), pulmonary and systemic congestion and marked cardiac hypertrophy. These changes were exacerbated in Decom-ACF. <b>Ularitide</b> treatment of ACF rats was associated with natriuresis, diuresis, enhanced GFR with RAAS inhibition. This effect was evident in Com-ACF, maximized by OMA but attenuated in Decom-ACF, restored by OMA treatment.

40|$|Background: In {{patients}} with acute heart failure, early intervention with an intravenous vasodilator {{has been proposed}} as a therapeutic goal to reduce cardiac-wall stress and, potentially, myocardial injury, thereby favorably affecting patients' long-term prognosis. Methods: In this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 2157 {{patients with}} acute heart failure to receive a continuous intravenous infusion of either <b>ularitide</b> at a dose of 15 ng per kilogram of body weight per minute or matching placebo for 48 hours, in addition to accepted therapy. Treatment was initiated a median of 6 hours after the initial clinical evaluation. The coprimary outcomes were death from cardiovascular causes during a median follow-up of 15 months and a hierarchical composite end point that evaluated the initial 48 -hour clinical course. Results: Death from cardiovascular causes occurred in 236 patients in the <b>ularitide</b> group and 225 patients {{in the placebo group}} (21. 7 % vs. 21. 0 %; hazard ratio, 1. 03; 96 % confidence interval, 0. 85 to 1. 25; P= 0. 75). In the intention-to-treat analysis, there was no significant between-group difference with respect to the hierarchical composite outcome. The <b>ularitide</b> group had greater reductions in systolic blood pressure and in levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide than the placebo group. However, changes in cardiac troponin T levels during the infusion did not differ between the two groups in the 55 % of patients with paired data. Conclusions: In patients with acute heart failure, <b>ularitide</b> exerted favorable physiological effects (without affecting cardiac troponin levels), but short-term treatment did not affect a clinical composite end point or reduce long-term cardiovascular mortality.

40|$|The TRUE-AHF is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, {{placebo-controlled}} trial {{which is}} evaluating {{the effects of}} a 48 -h infusion of <b>ularitide</b> (15 [*]ng/kg/min) on the short- and long-term clinical course of patients with acute heart failure. Noteworthy features of the study include the early enrolment of patients following their initial clinical presentation (within 12 [*]h), and entry blood pressure criteria and thresholds for the adjustment of drug infusion rates, which aim to minimize the risk of hypotension. The trial has two primary endpoints: (i) cardiovascular mortality during long-term follow-up; and (ii) the clinical course of patients during their index hospitalization. Cardiovascular mortality is evaluated in this event-driven trial by following all randomized patients for the occurrence of death {{until the end of the}} entire study without truncation at an arbitrarily determined early time point. The clinical course during the index hospitalization is evaluated using the hierarchical clinical composite endpoint, which combines information regarding changes in symptoms and the occurrence of in-hospital worsening heart failure events and death into a single ranked metric that captures interval clinical events and minimizes the likelihood of missing data and confounding due to intensification of background therapy. The design of the TRUE-AHF trial capitalizes on lessons learned from earlier trials and aims to evaluate definitively the potential benefit of <b>ularitide</b> in patients with acute heart failure...|$|E
40|$|Background: Acute decompensated {{heart failure}} (ADHF) is {{associated}} with increased hospitalization rates and high in-hospital mortality, and {{has emerged as a}} major public health problem over the past decade. In recent years, several new drugs and therapeutic approaches have failed to reduce short- and long-term morbidity and mortality in ADHF patients. New agents and strategies are under investigation in order to effectively reduce the mortality and morbidity in these patients. Objective: To review the recent experimental and clinical evidence on existing therapeutic algorithms and investigational drugs used for the treatment of ADHF. Methods: A systematic search of peer-reviewed publications was performed on Medline and EMBASE from January 1995 to January 2009. The results of unpublished trials were obtained from presentations at national and international meetings. Results: Renal dysfunction and low systolic blood pressure (SBP) remain the main predictors of adverse clinical outcomes in ADHF patients. Thus, therapy should be tailored according to the level of SBP at admission, renal function and fluid retention. ADHF due to hypertensive disease should be treated with intravenous vasodilators and diuretics at low doses, while patients with low output syndrome need mainly inotropic support. However, few agents currently employed in the treatment of ADHF have been shown in large prospective randomized clinical trials to improve clinical outcomes. The calcium sensitizer levosimendan is superior than traditional inotropes in improving central hemodynamics and neurohormonal response in ADHF patients, without increasing their long-term survival. Vasopressin antagonists also seem to be promising and safe drugs in the treatment of ADHF patients, facilitating diuresis on top of standard-care therapy. Encouraging novel therapies include adenosine receptor antagonists, <b>ularitide,</b> istaroxime, cardiac myosin activators and relaxin. Conclusions: Clinical scenarios based on SBP are essential determinants of therapeutic approaches used for the management of ADHF. Traditional drugs (diuretics, dobutamine and milrinone) have several limitations in real clinical practice, and increase mortality rates. Investigational drugs targeting to novel pathophysiologic concepts are promising treatment approaches and ongoing trials will define their clinical efficacy and safety...|$|E
40|$|Domingo A Pascual-Figal, Francisco Pastor-Perez, Luis Caballero, Iris P Garrido, Maria Teresa Perez-MartinezCardiology Department, Virgen de la Arrixaca University Hospital, School of Medicine, University of Murcia, Murcia, SpainAbstract: Acute {{heart failure}} (AHF) {{represents}} a major burden in developed countries. However, pharmacological approaches have remained {{almost the same}} for 30 years and are still based on consensus rather than evidence, given that no medical therapy {{has been shown to}} positively affect clinical outcomes. Current pharmacological approaches are still based on decongestion by using diuretics in almost all patients, plus either vasodilators or inotropic agents to improve hemodynamics according to perfusion status. The role of loop diuretics (furosemide) and nitrates (nitroglycerin and nitroprusside) is well established, but new agents such as vasopressin and adenosine antagonists, as well as nesiritide, have failed to show any additional value. In the presence of hypoperfusion, the use of inotropics must be considered despite the lack of benefit in terms of survival, and the use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors and levosimendan has not shown any significant advantages over catecholamines (dobutamine). AHF involves a wide spectrum of patients and syndromes, and this probably accounts for the failure of trials set up to evaluate new therapeutic approaches for improving outcomes: therapies need to be tailored to specific patients. At this time, serelaxin represents a promising new agent which has a multifaceted effect, including organ protection, and has shown encouraging results when tailored for a well defined population. In addition, the role of <b>ularitide,</b> a synthetic form of the natriuretic peptide urodilatin, and the new cardiac myosin activators, as a new class of inotropic agents, will be established in the near future by ongoing trials. Therefore, AHF continues to be an unsolved problem and, in light of the lessons learned, new pharmacological approaches should be tailored to well defined AHF populations, incorporating concepts such as “the sooner the better”, “improve and stabilize”, and “prevent organ damage”, {{in order to be able}} to improve clinical outcomes, including both mortality and readmission rates.
