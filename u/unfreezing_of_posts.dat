40|$|Abstract — Freezing of gait (FOG) is {{a common}} {{complication}} in movement disorders, typically associated with the advanced stages of Parkinson’s disease. Auditory cues {{might be used to}} facilitate <b>unfreezing</b> <b>of</b> gait and prevent fall related injuries. We present a wearable, unobtrusive system for real-time gait monitoring, which consists of an inertial wearable sensor and wireless headset for the delivery of acoustic cues. The system recognizes FOG episodes with minimum latency and delivers acoustic cues to unfreeze the gait. We present design of a system for the detection and <b>unfreezing</b> <b>of</b> gait (deFOG), and preliminary results of the feasibility study. In a limited test run of 4 test cases the system was able to detect freezing of gait with average latency of 332 ms, and maximum latency of 580 ms.

50|$|Stephenson Harwood {{played an}} {{instrumental}} role securing release of American hostages during the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis. Acting for Bank Markazi, a leading Iranian financial institution, their personnel became de facto mediators between Iran and America. At the time all foreign Iranian assets, {{including those of}} Bank Markazi, were frozen by economic hitmen. A key factor delaying {{release of the hostages}} was the <b>unfreezing</b> <b>of</b> Iranian assets. Stephenson Harwood engineered the means by which this could be done, causing US Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance to laud the firm.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} model of the {{dynamical}} transition of atomic displacements in proteins. Increased mean-square displacement at higher temperatures is caused by softening of the vibrational force constant by electrostatic and van der Waals forces from the protein-water thermal bath. Vibrational softening passes through a nonergodic dynamical transition when the relaxation time of the force-force correlation function enters, with increasing temperature, the instrumental observation window. Two crossover temperatures are identified. The lower crossover, presently connected to the glass transition, is related to the dynamical <b>unfreezing</b> <b>of</b> rotations of water molecules within nanodomains polarized by charged surface residues of the protein. The higher crossover temperature, usually assigned to the dynamical transition, marks the onset of water translations. All crossovers are ergodicity breaking transitions depending on the corresponding observation windows. Allowing stretched exponential relaxation of the protein-water thermal bath significantly improves the theory-experiment agreement when applied to solid protein samples studied by Moessbauer spectroscopy...|$|R
40|$|The complex {{dynamics}} in supramolecular structures of poly(p- phenylenes) with short ethylene oxide (EO) side chains (known as "hairy rods") {{have been studied}} by combining temperature and pressure dependent dielectric spectroscopy (DS) with different nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. The system forms a periodic lattice of layers of the main chains separated by layers of the amorphous EO chains. Since the dipole moment {{is located on the}} EO side chain, DS is probing mainly the side- chain motions and only indirectly the backbone dynamics. On the other hand, the different NMR techniques are also sensitive to the backbone mobility and provide the molecular origin of the dynamic processes. Two dielectrically active processes exist, a "fast" beta (which differs from the usual Johari-Goldstein beta process found in homopolymers and low molecular weight glass- forming liquids) and a "slow" alpha process with the latter carrying most of the intensity. Comparison of the NMR and dielectric results identifies the outer EO units as solely responsible for the dielectric beta process whereas both the short EO segments and the <b>unfreezing</b> <b>of</b> the internal backbone {{dynamics in}}cluding bending motions contribute to the alpha process. The <b>unfreezing</b> <b>of</b> the backbone dynamics does not lead to the dissolution of the structure that only happens at even higher temperatures. Hairy rod molecules thus can serve as model systems which provide the means of studying the effect of confinement on the dynamics. In this respect, the effect of confinement is mainly on the temperature dependence of the alpha-process relaxation times. (C) 2002 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

30|$|A similar {{behavior}} of materials is {{observed in the}} thermomechanical test (Figure  2 b). Relative strain curve of PE- 80 /PE- 100 weld during the melting at temperatures higher than T[*]=[*] 140 °C is located between respective curves for pure PE- 80 and PE- 100. Wherein under temperatures 25 - 130 °C, PE- 80 /PE- 100 weld has the maximum values of thermal expansion (insert in Figure  2 b) comparing to the pure PE- 80 and PE- 100. It {{can be explained by}} the existence of the internal stresses in “frozen” areas of the amorphous part of polymer, which appear during welding process. Relaxation and <b>unfreezing</b> <b>of</b> these areas at heating lead to enhancing of molecular mobility and increasing of the material volume.|$|R

40|$|The authors {{compare the}} {{implementation}} of two apparently similar stabilization programs by two reforming socialist countries, launched two weeks apart (Dec. 1989 in Yugoslavia and Jan. 1990 in Poland). They investigate possible differences underlying the apparently similar programs that may account for better initial performance of Yugoslavia's program (a sharper reduction of inflation with smaller losses in output). The authors identify significant differences in initial conditions {{in the two countries}} as well as the sequence and degree of some policy measures. The differences may explain the difference in the early results. They also identify the most important issues the two countries must address in the second stage of reform. These include the <b>unfreezing</b> <b>of</b> nominal variables and resolving the critical structural problems affecting both economies. The authors conclude that the microfoundations of socialist and market economies are clearly different. These differences imply that in socialist economies the case for including incomes policy in stabilization programs may be stronger.

5000|$|The {{negotiations}} {{resulted in}} the [...] "Algiers Accords" [...] of January 19, 1981.

The Accords also created the Iran - United States Claims Tribunal, and Iran deposited $1 billion in an escrow account to satisfy claims adjudicated by the Tribunal in favor of American businesses that had lost assets after the hostage takeover. The Tribunal closed to new claims by private individuals on January 19, 1982. In total, it received approximately 4,700 private U.S. claims.

Argentina needed to win by a margin of four goals to proceed to the final and did so by defeating Peru by 6-0. However, claims that the Argentine military dictatorship interfered to ensure Argentina would defeat Peru, were denied by the Peruvian captain and several Peruvian players. Some accusations originated in the Brazilian media and pointed to the fact that the Peruvian goalkeeper had been born in Argentina. There is also an alleged deal, reported by the British media as an anonymous rumour, that involved the delivery of a large grain shipment to Peru by Argentina and the <b>unfreezing</b> <b>of</b> a Peruvian bank account that was held by the Argentine Central Bank. Another alleged deal, published by a Colombian drug lord in a controversial book, involved the Peruvian team being bribed without any political implications.
