5|$|The Status and {{recommendations}} category houses four sub-sections: 1-Click Maintenance, Performance Optimizer, Fix Problems and Live Optimization. The 1-Click Maintenance section runs multiple routine maintenance tools at once. The Performance Optimizer and Fix Problems <b>utilities</b> <b>are</b> {{intended to provide}} tips to identify and fix potential problems and increase performance, such as disabling unnecessary visual effects and disabling or removing unused Windows services and programs. Live Optimization, according to the application's author, is intended to improve the responsiveness of Windows applications by tweaking their execution priorities.|$|E
5|$|The city {{provides}} {{sewage disposal}} and water supply services, with water {{coming from the}} Huron River and groundwater sources. There are two water-treatment plants, one main and three outlying reservoirs, four pump stations, and two water towers. These facilities serve the city, which is divided into five water districts. The city's water department also operates four dams along the Huron River, two of which provide hydroelectric power. The city also offers waste management services, with Recycle Ann Arbor handling recycling service. Other <b>utilities</b> <b>are</b> provided by private entities. Electrical power and gas are provided by DTE Energy. AT Inc. is the primary wired telephone service provider for the area. Cable TV service is primarily provided by Comcast.|$|E
5|$|The {{resistive}} Joule {{heating effect}} employed in filament light bulbs also sees more direct use in electric heating. While this is versatile and controllable, {{it can be}} seen as wasteful, since most electrical generation has already required the production of heat at a power station. A number of countries, such as Denmark, have issued legislation restricting or banning the use of resistive electric heating in new buildings. Electricity is however still a highly practical energy source for heating and refrigeration, with air conditioning/heat pumps representing a growing sector for electricity demand for heating and cooling, the effects of which electricity <b>utilities</b> <b>are</b> increasingly obliged to accommodate.|$|E

5|$|Other <b>utilities</b> <b>are</b> {{provided}} by private entities or South Korean government-owned companies. Seorabeol City Gas, {{an affiliate of}} GS Group, provides gas to the Gyeongju residents, while, electrical power is supplied by the public enterprises, Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power via the Wolseong Nuclear Power Plant. The plant is known for the only nuclear power plant operating PHWRs (Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor) in South Korea and supplies about 5% of South Korea's electricity. The owner, Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power began to build the Wolseong 1 in the districts of Yangnam-myeon, Yangbuk-myeon and Gampo-eup in 1976. Since 1983, the power plant has been providing commercial service and operating with the PHWRs that has a capacity of 678,000kW. As the construction of each Wolseong 2, 3 and 4 with a capacity of 70,000kW were completed respectively in 1997, 1998 and 1999, Wolseong Nuclear Power plant site has been successfully operating the four PHWRs plants. New project, Sinwolseong No. 1 and No. 2 are currently under construction which {{is estimated to be}} completed until 2011–12.|$|E

25|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Tanzania is characterised by: decreasing access {{to at least}} basic water sources in the 2000s (especially in urban areas), steady access {{to some form of}} sanitation (around 93% since the 1990s), intermittent water supply and generally low quality of service. Many <b>utilities</b> <b>are</b> barely able to cover their operation and maintenance costs through revenues due to low tariffs and poor efficiency. There are significant regional differences and the best performing <b>utilities</b> <b>are</b> Arusha and Tanga.|$|E
25|$|Autonomous public <b>utilities</b> <b>are</b> {{typically}} affiliated to {{the local}} corporation in their governorate. They are cost centers within the LC. For example, the autonomous utility in Bait al-Faqih reports {{to the local}} corporation in Hodeidah, and the autonomous utility in Rada'a, where the reform process had been piloted, reports to the local corporation in Al/Bayda'. Two of the 15 autonomous <b>utilities</b> <b>are</b> still affiliated to NWSA. These two utilities—in Ataq, the capital of Shabwah Governorate, and in Al Mahwit—are located in governorates {{where there is no}} local corporation yet. They are in an intermediate state before becoming LCs. The Rada’a Principles apply to all autonomous public utilities.|$|E
25|$|Independently {{of whether}} <b>utilities</b> <b>are</b> {{established}} under {{public or private}} law, all infrastructure is publicly owned.

25|$|Some common {{indicators}} of the economic efficiency of water and sewerage <b>utilities</b> <b>are</b> billing efficiency, the level of non-revenue water and labour productivity.

Combat <b>utilities</b> <b>are</b> also authorized for those attached to the Naval Construction Force (NCF) (Seabee), Navy's Expeditionary Logistics Group, or the Navy's Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC). Also, Navy personnel assigned to some joint headquarters units, like Central Command in Qatar and Iraq, wear Desert Utility Uniforms (DUU). Navy personnel such as Individual Augmentees, Combat Camera Groups, Detainee OPS, and some in the special warfare community have been wearing the Army's ACU (Army Combat Uniform) when working closely with or attached to Army commands.|$|E
25|$|Egyptian <b>utilities</b> <b>are</b> overstaffed. They {{employed}} 98,500 {{staff in}} 2008 for 9.5 million subscribers, equivalent {{to more than}} 10 employees per 1000 connections. In 2012/13 this figure has decreased to 6.5 according to EWRA. Good practice for water and sanitation utilities is to have less than 5 employees.|$|E
