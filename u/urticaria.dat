5|$|A {{subgroup}} of solar <b>urticaria,</b> fixed solar <b>urticaria,</b> {{has also been}} identified. It is a rare, less intense form of the disease with wheals (swollen areas of the skin) that affect certain, fixed areas of the body. Fixed solar <b>urticaria</b> is induced by {{a broad spectrum of}} radiative energy with wavelengths ranging from 300–700nm.|$|E
5|$|Another test {{known as}} a phototest is the most useful in {{identifying}} solar <b>urticaria.</b> In this test, one centimeter segments of skin are subject to varying amounts of UVA and UVB radiation {{in order to determine}} the specific dosage of the certain form of radiation that causes the <b>urticaria</b> to form. When testing for its less intense form (fixed solar <b>urticaria),</b> phototesting should be conducted only in the areas where the hives have appeared to avoid the possibility of getting false-negative results.|$|E
5|$|Patients {{with less}} potent forms of solar <b>urticaria</b> such as fixed solar <b>urticaria</b> {{can be treated}} with the {{medication}} fexofenadine, which may also be used prophylactically to prevent recurrence.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{only about}} 4% of {{patients}} with photosensitive disorders are reported to {{have been diagnosed with}} solar <b>urticaria.</b> Internationally, the number is slightly larger at 5.3%. Solar <b>urticaria</b> may occur in all races but studies monitoring 135 African Americans and 110 Caucasians with photodermatoses found that 2.2% of the African Americans had SU and 8% of the Caucasians had the disease showing that Caucasians {{have a better chance of}} getting the disease. Globably 3.1 per 100,000 people are affected and females are more likely to be affected than males. The age ranges anywhere from 5–70 years old, but the average age is 35 and cases have been reported with children that are still in infancy. Solar <b>urticaria</b> accounts for less than one percent of the many documented <b>urticaria</b> cases. To put that into a better perspective, since its first documented case in Japan in 1916, over one hundred other instances of the disease have been reported.|$|E
5|$|Polymorphous light {{eruption}} (PMLE) is {{the easiest}} disease to mistake for solar <b>urticaria</b> because {{the locations of the}} lesions are similar (the V of the neck and the arms). However, patients with SU are more likely to develop lesions on the face. Also, a reaction with PMLE will take a greater amount of time to appear than with solar <b>urticaria.</b> Lupus erythematosus has been mistaken for SU; however, lesions from lupus erythematosus will take a longer amount of time to go away. Furthermore, when being tested for the two diseases, patients with SU have a reaction immediately while patients with lupus erythematosus will have a delayed reaction. Patients who have experienced solar urticarial symptoms from a young age could mistakenly be thought to have erythropoietic protoporphyria. However, the main symptom for this disease is pain and patients with have been found to have abnormal levels of protoporphyrin in their blood while these levels are normal in SU patients. Finally, cholinergic <b>urticaria,</b> or <b>urticaria</b> induced by heat, can occasionally appear to be solar <b>urticaria</b> because the heat from the sun will cause a person with the disease to have a reaction.|$|E
5|$|Solar <b>urticaria</b> (SU) {{is a rare}} {{condition}} in which exposure to ultraviolet or UV radiation, or sometimes even visible light, induces a case of <b>urticaria</b> or hives that can appear in both covered and uncovered areas of the skin. It is classified {{as a type of}} physical <b>urticaria.</b> The classification of disease types is somewhat controversial. One classification system distinguished various types of SU based on the wavelength of the radiation that causes the breakout; another classification system is based on the type of allergen that initiates a breakout.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{there have}} been a few unorthodox (unusual) causes of solar <b>urticaria.</b> For those {{susceptible}} to visible light, white T-shirts may increase the chances of experiencing an outbreak. In one case, doctors found that the white T-shirt absorbed UVA radiation from the sun and transformed it into visible light which caused the reaction. Another patient was being treated with the antibiotic tetracycline for a separate dermatological disorder and broke out in hives when exposed to the sun, the first case to implicate tetracycline as a solar <b>urticaria</b> inducing agent.|$|E
5|$|Doctors will {{sometimes}} prescribe immunosuppressive {{drugs such as}} prednisolone and ciclosporin if the patient is suffering from an intense form of solar <b>urticaria.</b> However, {{the side effects of}} these medicines can be severe which is why they are reserved for the most extreme of cases.|$|E
5|$|It {{is not yet}} {{known what}} {{specific}} agent in the body brings about the allergic reaction to the radiation. When patients with SU were injected with an irradiated autologous serum, many developed <b>urticaria</b> within the area of injection. When {{people who did not}} have SU were injected, they did not demonstrate similar symptoms. This indicates that the reaction is only a characteristic of the patients with solar <b>urticaria</b> and that it is not phototoxic. It is possible that this photoallergen is located on the binding sites of IgE that are found on the surface of mast cells. The photoallergen is believed to begin its configuration through the absorption of radiation by a chromophore. The molecule, because of the radiation, is transformed resulting in the formation of a new photoallergen.|$|E
5|$|This form of {{treatment}} {{is meant to}} reduce the intensity or altogether eliminate the allergic reactions people have by gradually increasing exposure to the form of radiation that brings about the reaction. In the case of solar <b>urticaria,</b> phototherapy and photochemotherapy are the two major desensitization treatments.|$|E
5|$|Histamines are {{proteins}} {{associated with}} many allergic reactions. When the UV radiation or light {{comes in contact}} with a person with solar <b>urticaria,</b> histamine is released from mast cells. When this occurs, the permeability of vessels near the area of histamine release is increased. This allows blood fluid to enter the vessels and cause inflammation. Antihistamines suppress {{the activity of the}} histamine.|$|E
5|$|Systemic {{symptoms}} {{resulting from}} anaphylaxis can be dramatic. These may appear within 5 minutes post bite, {{or can be}} delayed for many hours. Such symptoms include nausea, retching and vomiting, abdominal colic and diarrhoea, incontinence of urine and faeces, sweating, fever, vasoconstriction, tachycardia, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, blindness, shock, angioedema of the face, lips, gums, tongue, throat and epiglottis, <b>urticaria</b> and bronchospasm. If left untreated, these symptoms may persist or fluctuate for up to 48 hours. In severe cases, cardiovascular failure may occur.|$|E
5|$|In other areas, {{such as the}} Mediterranean, some {{individuals}} have adverse reactions to apples because of their similarity to peaches. This form of apple allergy also includes OAS, but often has more severe symptoms, such as vomiting, abdominal pain and <b>urticaria,</b> and can be life-threatening. Individuals with this form of allergy can also develop reactions to other fruits and nuts. Cooking does not break down the protein causing this particular reaction, so affected individuals can eat neither raw nor cooked apples. Freshly harvested, over-ripe fruits tend to have {{the highest levels of}} the protein that causes this reaction.|$|E
5|$|Photochemotherapy, or PUVA, is {{considered}} superior to phototherapy because {{it produces a}} longer-lasting tolerance of the radiation that initiates the outbreak. When treatment first begins, the main goal is {{to build up the}} patient's tolerance to UVA radiation enough {{so that they can be}} outdoors without suffering an episode of solar <b>urticaria.</b> Therefore, treatments are regulated at three per week while constantly increasing the exposure to UVA radiation. Once the patient has reached an adequate level of desensitization, treatments are reduced to once or twice per week.|$|E
5|$|Solar <b>urticaria</b> can be {{difficult}} to diagnose, but its presence can be confirmed by the process of phototesting. There are several forms of these tests including photopatch tests, phototests, photoprovocation tests, and laboratory tests. All of these are necessary to determine the exact infliction that the patient is suffering from. Photopatch tests are patch tests conducted when it is believed that a patient is experiencing certain symptoms due to an allergy that will only occur when in contact with sunlight. After the procedure, the patient is given a low dosage of UVA radiation.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no natural}} source for green food colorings {{which has been}} {{approved}} by the US Food and Drug Administration. Chlorophyll, the E numbers E140 and E141, is the most common green chemical found in nature, and only allowed in certain medicines and cosmetic materials. Quinoline Yellow (E104) is a commonly used coloring in the United Kingdom but is banned in Australia, Japan, Norway and the United States. Green S (E142) is prohibited in many countries, for it is known to cause hyperactivity, asthma, <b>urticaria,</b> and insomnia.|$|E
25|$|Dermatological: Itching, burning, <b>urticaria.</b>|$|E
25|$|Skin {{sensitizer}} — causing allergic {{contact dermatitis}} and <b>urticaria.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other {{side effects}} include nausea and vomiting, anorexia, sideroblastic anemia, skin rash, <b>urticaria,</b> pruritus, dysuria, {{interstitial}} nephritis, malaise; rarely porphyria, and fever.|$|E
25|$|Wheat allergies are not {{altogether}} {{different from other}} food allergies or respiratory allergies. However two conditions, exercise/aspirin induced anaphylaxis and <b>urticaria</b> occur more frequently with wheat allergies.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{excessive}} {{alcohol abuse}} {{is associated with}} a wide range of skin disorders including <b>urticaria,</b> porphyria cutanea tarda, flushing, cutaneous stigmata of cirrhosis, psoriasis, pruritus, seborrheic dermatitis and rosacea.|$|E
25|$|Ciclosporin {{has also}} been used to help treat people with acute severe {{ulcerative}} colitis and autoimmune <b>urticaria</b> that {{do not respond to}} treatment with steroids. This drug is also used as a treatment of posterior or intermediate uveitis with noninfective cause.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these indications, ciclosporin is also used in severe atopic dermatitis, Kimura disease, pyoderma gangrenosum, chronic autoimmune <b>urticaria,</b> acute systemic mastocytosis, and, infrequently, in rheumatoid arthritis and related diseases, although it is only used in severe cases.|$|E
25|$|Hydroxyzine {{can also}} be used for the {{treatment}} of allergic conditions, such as chronic <b>urticaria,</b> atopic or contact dermatoses, and histamine-mediated pruritus. These have also been confirmed in both recent and past studies to have no adverse effects on the liver, blood, nervous system or urinary tract.|$|E
25|$|Cidoxepin {{is under}} {{development}} by Elorac, Inc. {{for the treatment}} of chronic <b>urticaria</b> (hives). As of 2017, it is in phase II clinical trials for this indication. The drug was also under investigation {{for the treatment of}} allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and contact dermatitis, but development for these indications was discontinued.|$|E
25|$|Infrequent adverse {{reactions}} in patients taking opioids for pain relief include: dose-related respiratory depression (especially with more potent opioids), confusion, hallucinations, delirium, <b>urticaria,</b> hypothermia, bradycardia/tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, headache, urinary retention, ureteric or biliary spasm, muscle rigidity, myoclonus (with high doses), and flushing (due to histamine release, except fentanyl and remifentanil).|$|E
25|$|Some {{people have}} {{allergic}} reactions to avocado. There {{are two main}} forms of allergy: those with a tree-pollen allergy develop local symptoms in the mouth and throat shortly after eating avocado; the second, known as latex-fruit syndrome, is related to latex allergy and symptoms include generalised <b>urticaria,</b> abdominal pain, and vomiting and can sometimes be life-threatening.|$|E
25|$|Reported {{adverse events}} which were {{temporally}} correlated to duloxetine therapy include rash, reported rarely, {{and the following}} adverse events, reported very rarely: alanine aminotransferase increased, alkaline phosphatase increased, anaphylactic reaction, angioneurotic edema, aspartate aminotransferase increased, bilirubin increased, glaucoma, hepatotoxicity, hyponatremia, jaundice, orthostatic hypotension (especially at the initiation of treatment), Stevens–Johnson syndrome, syncope (especially at initiation of treatment), and <b>urticaria.</b>|$|E
25|$|IgE {{also has}} an {{essential}} role in type I hypersensitivity, which manifests in various allergic diseases, such as allergic asthma, most types of sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, food allergies, and specific types of chronic <b>urticaria</b> and atopic dermatitis. IgE also plays a pivotal role in responses to allergens, such as: anaphylactic drugs, bee stings, and antigen preparations used in desensitization immunotherapy.|$|E
25|$|When {{proteins}} are {{cut into}} polypeptides, buried regions {{are exposed to}} the surface, and these buried regions may possibly be antigenic. Such hydrolyzed wheat protein is used as an additive in foods and cosmetics. The peptides are often 1 kD in size (9 amino acid residues in length) and may increase the allergic response. These wheat polypeptides can cause immediate contact <b>urticaria</b> in susceptible people.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms may {{not appear}} until some {{days after the}} bites have occurred. Reactions often become more brisk after {{multiple}} bites due to possible sensitization to the salivary proteins of the bed bug. The skin reaction usually occurs {{in the area of}} the bite which is most commonly the arms, shoulders and legs as they are more frequently exposed at night. Numerous bites may lead to an erythematous rash or <b>urticaria.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1978 Australian {{researchers}} published {{details of}} an 'exclusion diet' to exclude specific food chemicals from the diet of patients. This provided {{a basis for}} challenge with these additives and natural chemicals. Using this approach {{the role played by}} dietary chemical factors in the pathogenesis of chronic idiopathic <b>urticaria</b> (CIU) was first established and set the stage for future DBPCT trials of such substances in food intolerance studies.|$|E
25|$|Acquired {{angioedema}} (AAE) can be immunologic, nonimmunologic, or idiopathic. It {{is usually}} caused by allergy and occurs {{together with other}} allergic symptoms and <b>urticaria.</b> It can also occur as a side effect to certain medications, particularly ACE inhibitors. It is characterized by repetitive episodes of swelling, frequently of the face, lips, tongue, limbs, and genitals. Edema of the gastrointestinal mucosa typically leads to severe abdominal pain; in the upper respiratory tract, it can be life-threatening.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} side effects are fine tremor, anxiety, headache, muscle cramps, dry mouth, and palpitation. Other {{symptoms}} may include tachycardia, arrhythmia, flushing of the skin, myocardial ischemia (rare), and disturbances {{of sleep and}} behaviour. Rarely occurring, but of importance, are allergic reactions of paradoxical bronchospasms, <b>urticaria</b> (hives), angioedema, hypotension, and collapse. High doses or prolonged use may cause hypokalemia, which is of concern especially in patients with renal failure and those on certain diuretics and xanthine derivatives.|$|E
25|$|Reported {{side effects}} of {{cimetidine}} include diarrhea, rashes, dizziness, fatigue, constipation, and muscle pain, {{all of which are}} usually mild and transient. It has been reported that mental confusion may occur in the elderly. Because of its hormonal effects, cimetidine rarely may cause sexual dysfunction including loss of libido and erectile dysfunction and gynecomastia (0.1–0.2%) in males during long-term treatment. Rarely, interstitial nephritis, <b>urticaria,</b> and angioedema have been reported with cimetidine treatment. Cimetidine is also commonly associated with transient raised aminotransferase activity; hepatotoxicity is rare.|$|E
25|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} {{associated with}} the use of flucloxacillin include: diarrhoea, nausea, rash, <b>urticaria,</b> pain and inflammation at injection site, superinfection (including candidiasis), allergy, and transient increases in liver enzymes and bilirubin. Rarely, cholestatic jaundice (also referred to as cholestatic hepatitis) has been associated with flucloxacillin therapy. The reaction may occur up to several weeks after treatment has stopped, and takes weeks to resolve. The estimated incidence is one in 15,000 exposures, and is more frequent in people >55 years, females, and those with treatment longer than two weeks.|$|E
