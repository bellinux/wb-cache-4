500|$|On February 26, 1957, Wilhelm {{was traded}} by the Giants to the St. Louis Cardinals for Whitey Lockman. At {{the time of}} the trade, St. Louis manager Fred Hutchinson {{described}} Wilhelm as the type of pitcher who [...] "makes us a definite pennant threat... He'll help <b>us</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> need help the most." [...] In 40 games with the Cardinals that season, he earned 11 saves but finished with a 1–4 record and his highest ERA to that point in his career (4.25). The Cardinals placed him on waivers in September and he was claimed by the Cleveland Indians, who used him in two games that year.|$|E
500|$|Contemporary reviews have {{praised the}} episode {{as one of}} the show's best installments. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two wrote that the episode was [...] "funny, it's clever, and it's {{actually}} quite frightening". Shearman and Pearson also wrote positively of the faux documentary style, likening it to The Blair Witch Project. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an [...] "A–" [...] and called it [...] "witty, inventive, and intermittently spooky". He argued that the episode was a late-series [...] "gimmick episode" [...] and compared it to the last few seasons of House; although he reasoned that House relied on gimmicks to prop itself up, [...] "X-Cops" [...] is [...] "the work of a creative team which may be running out of ideas, but still has enough gas in the tank to get <b>us</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> need to go." [...] Furthermore, Handlen felt that the show used the Cops format to the best of its ability, and that many of the scenes were humorous, startling, or a combination of both.|$|E

2500|$|Seeger died at New York-Presbyterian Hospital on January 27, 2014, {{at the age}} of 94. Response and {{reaction}} to Seeger's death quickly poured in. President Barack Obama noted that Seeger had been called [...] "America's tuning fork" [...] and that he believed in [...] "the power of song" [...] to bring social change, [...] "Over the years, Pete used his voice and his hammer to strike blows for workers' rights and civil rights; world peace and environmental conservation, and he always invited us to sing along. For reminding <b>us</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> come from and showing <b>us</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> need to go, we will always be grateful to Pete Seeger." [...] Folksinger and fellow activist Billy Bragg wrote that: [...] "Pete believed that music could make a difference. Not change the world, he never claimed that – he once said that if music could change the world he'd only be making music – but he believed that while music didn't have agency, it did have the power to make a difference." [...] Bruce Springsteen said of Seeger's death, [...] "I lost a great friend and a great hero last night, Pete Seeger", before performing [...] "We Shall Overcome" [...] while on tour in South Africa.|$|E
2500|$|Always {{reluctant}} to discuss {{himself and his}} art, Hopper simply said, [...] "The whole answer is there on the canvas." [...] Hopper was stoic and fatalistic—a quiet introverted man with a gentle {{sense of humor and}} a frank manner. Hopper was someone drawn to an emblematic, anti-narrative symbolism, who [...] "painted short isolated moments of configuration, saturated with suggestion". His silent spaces and uneasy encounters [...] "touch <b>us</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> are most vulnerable", and have [...] "a suggestion of melancholy, that melancholy being enacted". His sense of color revealed him as a pure painter as he [...] "turned the Puritan into the purist, in his quiet canvasses where blemishes and blessings balance". According to critic Lloyd Goodrich, he was [...] "an eminently native painter, who more than any other was getting more of the quality of America into his canvases".|$|E
2500|$|Richard Corliss {{also notes}} that the song was even more {{significant}} having been released soon after America entered World War II: [...] "connected with... GIs in their first winter away from home. To them it voiced the ache of separation and the wistfulness they felt for the girl back home, for the innocence of youth...." [...] Poet Carl Sandburg wrote, [...] "We have learned {{to be a little}} sad and a little lonesome without being sickly about it. This feeling is caught in the song of a thousand jukeboxes and tune whistled in streets and homes. [...] "I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas'. When we sing that we don't hate anybody. And there are things we love that we're going to have sometimes if the breaks are not too bad against us. Way down under this latest hit of his, Irving Berlin catches <b>us</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> love peace." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{band members}} grew their hair long and allied {{themselves}} to the glam rock movement of the early 1970s. Hill's stage costumes also became notable during this period. Many of Holder's costumes during this period, including the trademark mirror top hat, were made by Dorothy [...] "Dolly" [...] Annakin—a sister of Holder's friend Ron Annakin. Chandler now demanded the band write a follow-up single themselves which led to Lea and Holder writing [...] "Coz I Luv You". The song was written {{in half an hour}} and started a writing partnership which would continue throughout Slade's career. Upon hearing the track played to him acoustically, a pleased Chandler predicted the song would make number one. While recording, the band felt the song's sound to be too soft, and so clapping was added. The song's misspelled title also became a trademark for Slade while causing a furor among British school teachers. The attendant appearance on BBC Television's Top of the Pops brought Slade to a wider audience as well as pushing [...] "Coz I Luv You" [...] to number one in the UK charts. In November 1971, NME reported that Slade had turned down a multimillion-dollar campaign, including a television series and a heavily promoted tour of the US. [...] "But", commented Holder, [...] "acceptance would have meant the cancellation of many commitments here – and the last thing {{we want to do is}} to mess around the people who have put <b>us</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> are".|$|E
