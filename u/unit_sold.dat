5|$|Sega {{announced}} {{the release of}} the Mega-CD in Japan for late 1991, and North America (as the Sega CD) in 1992. It was unveiled to the public {{for the first time at}} the 1991 Tokyo Toy Show, to positive reception from critics. The Mega-CD would go on to be released in Japan on December 12, 1991, initially retailing at JPÂ¥49,800. Though the <b>unit</b> <b>sold</b> quickly, the small install base of the Mega Drive in Japan meant that sales declined rapidly after launch. Within its first year in Japan, the Mega-CD only sold 100,000 units. Third-party development of games for the new system suffered because Sega took a long amount of time to release software development kits. Other factors impacting sales included the high launch price of the Mega-CD in Japan and only two titles being available at launch.|$|E
