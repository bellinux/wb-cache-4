25|$|In {{fact the}} {{builders}} {{of the new}} Albatros twin-gunned stationary-engined fighters of late 1916 had to introduce their own synchronization gear, known as the Hedtke gear or Hedtkesteuerung, and {{it was evident that}} Fokker {{were going to have to}} come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> radically new.|$|E
25|$|There is {{only one}} verb to {{tolerate}} and one adjective tolerant, but the two nouns tolerance and toleration have evolved slightly different meanings. Tolerance {{is a state of}} mind that implies non-judgmental acceptance of different lifestyles or beliefs, whereas toleration indicates the act of putting <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> that one disapproves of.|$|E
25|$|Chief Superintendent 'Farmer' Watson demands an {{explanation}} for Rebus's continued interest in the Central Fire, giving him twenty-four hours to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> concrete. Later that day, Rebus goes to Pat Calder and Eddie's flat to fill out an official missing person report. Calder reveals that Willie had cracked up trying to cope without Eddie, making a scene before leaving the restaurant.|$|E

25|$|A Kiss in the Dreamhouse was {{the first}} album on which the Banshees really {{exploited}} the possibilities of the studio. They allowed themselves to be inspired by sounds. Engineer Mike Hedges, who was interested in vocals, put different effects on Siouxsie's voice and multi-layered it. Hedges also encouraged them to fiddle with effects; if the band came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> off-the-wall, he'd want to top it.|$|E
25|$|The second-to-last {{banknote}} design series, designed by Tapio Wirkkala, {{was introduced in}} 1955 and revised in the reform of 1963. It was the first series to depict actual specific persons. These included Juho Kusti Paasikivi on the 10 markkaa, K. J. Ståhlberg on the 50 markkaa, J. V. Snellman on the 100 markkaa and Urho Kekkonen on the 500 markkaa (introduced later). Unlike Erik Bruun's series, this series did not depict any other real-life subjects, but only abstract ornaments {{in addition to the}} depictions of people. A popular joke at the time was to cover Paasikivi's face except for his ear and back of the head on the 10-markka note, ending <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> resembling a mouse, said to be the only animal illustration in the entire series.|$|E
25|$|Skillet {{formed in}} 1996 with two members: John Cooper, former vocalist for Tennessee {{progressive}} rock band Seraph, and Ken Steorts, former guitarist for Urgent Cry. The two bands met through touring together, but those bands disbanded soon after, so John and Ken's pastor {{encouraged them to}} form their own band as a side-project. Coming from different styles of rock music, they decided to name the experiment Skillet. After, Trey McClurkin joined the band as a temporary drummer. Skillet was only together for a month when they received interest from major Christian record label ForeFront Records. In 1996 they released a self-titled debut Skillet. It was well-received, and the trio continued to write new material as they toured the United States. One topic that comes up often among fans and the band itself, is the name 'Skillet'. John Cooper, the lead vocalist, explains {{that it was a}} joke at first. Each starting band member was already in a separate band, and all decided to start a side project. Since each other band had a different sound and style to it, the side project was said to be like putting all of those styles in a big skillet to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> unique, hence the band name 'Skillet'. The band name is still somewhat of a joke between the band members, especially Cooper, who claims to still not like the title.|$|E
6000|$|Flambeau {{looked up}} in surprise; but {{the girl with the}} red hair also looked <b>up,</b> and <b>with</b> <b>something</b> that was {{stronger}} than astonishment. She was simply and even loosely dressed in light brown sacking stuff; but she was a lady, and even, on a second glance, a rather needlessly haughty one. [...] "The man with the false nose!" [...] repeated Flambeau. [...] "Who's he?" ...|$|R
60|$|His head {{hurt and}} he was dizzy. He now remembered that he had run against a stump and fallen into the ditch; but he must brace <b>up</b> and <b>with</b> <b>something</b> of an effort he crossed the floor. So {{far as he could}} see, the warden's eyes were shut and his face was pinched. All the same, Simpson thought he breathed and when he touched him his skin was not cold.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, you see, it's a funny coincidence, but I {{was going}} to America, anyhow, to-morrow. I don't see why I shouldn't try to fix <b>up</b> <b>something</b> <b>with</b> this girl.' ...|$|R

500|$|The {{story of}} the Venus {{character}} helped the band give something to Tanaami that he [...] "could read and maybe translate into a visual representation".

500|$|Prior to {{auditioning for}} Popstars, Chana {{said that she}} was {{frequently}} approached by executives from Latin music record labels. She explained that she had felt unprepared for a music career because of insecurities stemming from only performing karaoke and not having taken vocal classes. Chana also wanted to avoid conventional Latin pop, saying that she [...] "wanted to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> distinctive, even if the crowd would be niche".|$|E

500|$|Nirvana had {{difficulty}} completing the song. Cobain attempted {{to have the}} rest of the band complete the song during jam sessions. He said, [...] "During those practices, I was trying to wait for Krist and Dave to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> but it just turned into noise all the time." [...] One day Cobain made one last attempt at completing the song. Cobain was {{able to come up with}} a vocal melody and the band finally finished writing the song. Cobain said that when they completed [...] "Heart-Shaped Box", [...] "We finally realized that it was a good song." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Keeps Gettin' Better" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer Christina Aguilera, {{taken from}} her first {{greatest}} hits album, [...] (2008). It was released on September 9, 2008, by RCA Records as the only single from the album. The song was written and produced by Linda Perry, with additional songwriting from Aguilera. After giving birth to her son Max, she looked to [...] "come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> new and fresh", developing a [...] "futuristic" [...] era of her career. [...] "Keeps Gettin' Better" [...] is an electroclash and electropop song, and {{was inspired by the}} likes of Andy Warhol and Goldfrapp. Its lyrics portray Aguilera as a superhero.|$|E
500|$|Jethro Tull's {{frontman}} {{and songwriter}} Ian Anderson {{was surprised when}} critics called the band's previous album, Aqualung (1971), a [...] "concept album". He rejected this, thinking {{it was simply a}} collection of songs, so in response decided to [...] "come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> that really is the mother of all concept albums". Taking the surreal English humour of Monty Python as an influence, he began to write a piece that would combine complex music with a sense of humour, with the idea it would poke light-hearted fun at the band, the audience, and the music critics. He also intended to satirise the progressive rock genre that was popular at the time.|$|E

50|$|A {{large chunk}} of most peoples’ lives will be spent at work. Most people {{recognise}} the importance of sleeping well, and actively try to enjoy the leisure time that they can snatch.

50|$|Initially {{his family}} {{rejected}} the idea to become a photographer and {{he was sent to}} the United States to study aerospace engineering. While in college, he went on learning photography by himself. He put <b>up</b> <b>with</b> studying <b>something</b> he did not like until 1991. Then he returned to Madrid and a friend suggested they go to Bosnia to cover the conflict. The war had just started. At first, he thought it was crazy but finally he agreed. So he sold his motorcycle and purchased some cameras. He was 23 years old when he covered the first conflict.|$|R
500|$|In May 2008, Scudamore told BBC Radio 5 Live {{that the}} {{proposal}} was [...] "not over", but that the League would [...] "come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> that ticks more boxes" [...] by January 2009. [...] In August 2008, Scudamore said that the League had [...] "a whole host of ideas, some more radical than others, but none quite as radical as the original concept". [...] In October 2008, he said Game 39 was still a possibility, although the timing of TV contracts meant {{it would be in}} the 2013–14 season at the earliest. [...] An agreement in December 2008 between the Premier League and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) was linked to Game 39 by the media.|$|E
500|$|Neil McCormick {{wrote about}} Zooropa, [...] "It {{feels like a}} minor work, and {{generally}} U2 don't do minor. But if you're {{not going to make}} the Big Statement, you're maybe going to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> that has the oxygen of pop music." [...] In 1997, Spin wrote, [...] "Zooropa took U2 as far from the monastic mysticism of The Joshua Tree as they could go. It freed U2 from itself." [...] Edna Gundersen of USA Today said in 2002, [...] "the alien territory of Achtung Baby and Zooropa cemented U2's relevance and enhanced its cachet as intrepid explorers". In 2011, Rolling Stone ranked the record at number 61 on its list of [...] "100 Best Albums of the Nineties".|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{originally}} released in a gatefold LP sleeve designed by Hipgnosis and George Hardie. [...] Hipgnosis had designed {{several of the}} band's previous albums, with controversial results; EMI had reacted with confusion {{when faced with the}} cover designs for Atom Heart Mother and Obscured by Clouds, as they had expected to see traditional designs which included lettering and words. [...] Designers Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell were able to ignore such criticism as they were employed by the band. [...] For The Dark Side of the Moon, Richard Wright instructed them to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> [...] "smarter, neater – more classy". [...] The prism design was inspired by a photograph that Thorgerson had seen during a brainstorming session with Powell.|$|E

50|$|Proof {{as we know}} it {{came about}} with one {{specific}} question: “what is a proof?” Traditionally, a proof is a platform which convinces someone beyond reasonable doubt that a statement is mathematically true. Naturally, one would assume {{that the best way to}} prove the truth of something like this (B) would be to draw <b>up</b> a comparison <b>with</b> <b>something</b> old (A) that has already been proven as true. Thus was created the concept of deriving a new result from an old result.|$|R
60|$|The Arab rose, shook himself {{clear of}} the dying man, and, with astounding coolness, walked calmly towards a large rock, though Miles was {{reloading}} in haste, and Sutherland was taking steady aim at him. He looked at the soldiers and held <b>up</b> his hand <b>with</b> <b>something</b> like a smile of remonstrance, as Sutherland pulled the trigger. At the same moment Miles struck up the muzzle, and the ball whizzed over the Arab's head as he passed behind the rock and disappeared.|$|R
500|$|BioShock 2 was {{announced}} in 2008, with its development being led by 2K Marin. Levine stated that Irrational (then 2K Boston) {{was not involved in}} the game's sequel because they wanted to [...] "swing for the fences" [...] and try to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> [...] "very, very different", which was later revealed as BioShock Infinite. BioShock 3 was also announced, with its release assumed to likely coincide with the BioShock film. BioShock 2 takes place about ten years following the events of the first game. The player assumes the role of Subject Delta, a precursor of the Big Daddies who must search the fallen city of Rapture for his former Little Sister, Eleanor. BioShock 2 was released for Windows PC, Mac, Xbox 360, and the PlayStation 3 worldwide on February 9, 2010.|$|E
500|$|They {{spent their}} final night in Nairobi at a YMCA, before they {{returned}} to London. The Beatles—according to McCartney—needed a new name, so on the flight back to England, Evans and McCartney played with words {{to see if they}} could come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> new. Evans innocently asked McCartney what the letters [...] "S" [...] and [...] "P" [...] stood for on the pots on their meal trays, and McCartney explained that it was for salt and pepper, which led to the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band name. They arrived back in London on 19 November 1966. Before the cover of Sgt. Pepper could be completed by Peter Blake, Evans and Aspinall were sent out to find photographs of all of the people that were to be shown on the front cover.|$|E
500|$|A Bolivian writer defined [...] "avatar" [...] as [...] "something born without human intervention, without intercourse, without sin", {{comparing}} it {{to the birth of}} Jesus Christ, Krishna, Manco Capac, and Mama Ocllo and drew parallels between the deity Eywa of Pandora and the goddess Pachamama worshiped by the indigenous people of the Andes. Another suggested that the world of Pandora mirrored the Garden of Eden. [...] A writer for Religion Dispatches countered that Avatar [...] "begs, borrows, and steals from a variety of longstanding human stories, puts them through the grinder, and comes <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> new." [...] Another commentator called Avatar [...] "a new version of the Garden of Eden syndrome" [...] pointing to what she viewed as phonetic and conceptual similarities of the film's terminology with that of the Book of Genesis.|$|E
