The article sets out some principles by which any social policy should be judged and goes on to discuss cash transfers alongside other instruments of social policy, namely the Public Distribution System (PDS) and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). It then examines the principal hypotheses associated with the arguments for and against cash transfers as a social policy instrument, drawing upon international experience. The article concludes that a <b>universal</b> unconditional <b>basic</b> <b>income</b> would have important advantages over alternative schemes, but cautions against undue haste in rolling out cash transfers to ensure a smooth transition...|$|R

25|$|Basic {{income has}} been {{discussed}} in modern Brazil {{at least since the}} 1980s. In 2001 a law was introduced by Senator Eduardo Suplicy of the Brazilian Workers Party which mandated the progressive institution of such a welfare system. By this move Brazil became the first country in the world to pass such a law. Suplicy had previously introduced a bill to create a Negative Income Tax, but that bill failed to pass. The new bill called for a national and <b>universal</b> <b>basic</b> <b>income</b> to be instituted, beginning with those most in need. The bill was approved by the Senate in 2002 and by the Chamber of Deputies in 2003. President Lula da Silva signed it into law in 2004, and according to the bill it is the president's responsibility to gradually implement the reform. Since then Brazil has started to implement the bill through the Bolsa Família-program, which was a centerpiece of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's social policy, and is reputed to {{have played a role in}} his victory in the Brazilian presidential election, 2006.|$|E

40|$|Much of {{the recent}} {{discussion}} in progressive circles [e. g., Stiglitz; Galbraith; Piketty] has focused the obscene mal-distribution of wealth and income {{as if that was}} "the" problem in our economic system. And the proposed redistributive reforms (e. g., changes in income, wealth, and estate taxes, increased minimum wages, <b>income</b> caps, and <b>universal</b> <b>basic</b> <b>incomes)</b> have all stuck to that framing of the question. To put the question in historical perspective, one might note that there was a similar, if not more extreme, mal-distribution of wealth, income, and political power in the Antebellum system of slavery. Yet, it should be obvious to modern eyes that redistributions in favor of the slaves (surely a good thing), while leaving the institution of owning workers intact, would not address {{the root of the problem}}. The system of slavery was eventually abolished in favor of the system we have today which differs in two important respects: (1) the workers are only rented, hired, or employed (i. e., the employer/master only buys some, but not all, of employee's labor); and (2) the rental relationship between employer and employee is voluntary. Today, the root of the problem is the whole institution for the voluntary renting of human beings, the employment system itself, not the terms of the contract or the accumulated consequences in the form of the mal-distribution of income and wealth...|$|R

40|$|Reimagining {{equity and}} egalitarianism calls for {{rethinking}} traditional welfare responses to poverty and economic security in Australia.

5000|$|De Keyzer is, {{among other}} things, a strong {{proponent of the}} {{principle}} of a <b>basic</b> <b>universal</b> <b>income.</b> In a recent article in leading Dutch-language business newspaper De Tijd he argued, [...] "A guaranteed <b>basic</b> <b>income</b> provides a solution for people with few job skills. Nowadays a lot of relatively uneducated people have too little to offer in order to warrant even the gross minimum wage. Today someone who is able to deliver only 700 euros of added value per month will not find an official job because an employer would be obliged to pay him or her not less than the gross national minimum wage of 1500 euros. This means that people with low educational qualifications remain unemployed, living on a social security allowance of 1100 euros. Setting a guaranteed <b>basic</b> <b>income</b> of 800 euros would solve the problem for both employers and the unemployed. The undereducated can get a job and will have much more left over for themselves {{at the end of the}} month than someone who is not working at all.

40|$|<b>Basic</b> <b>Income</b> in Japan is {{the first}} {{collective}} volume in English entirely devoted to the discussion of Japan's potential for a <b>basic</b> <b>income</b> program {{in the context of}} the country's changing welfare state. Vanderborght and Yamamori bring together over a dozen contributors to provide a general overview of the scholarly debate on <b>universal</b> and unconditional <b>basic</b> <b>income,</b> including a foreword by Ronald Dore. Drawing on empirical data on poverty and inequality as well as normative arguments, this balanced approach to a radical idea is essential reading for the study of contemporary Japan. "Basic Income in Japan adopts a focused perspective on a broad range of contemporary issues. To those interested in <b>basic</b> <b>income,</b> it offers the possibility of renewing the terms of the debate by exploring the case of a country that has been partly left aside in previous discussions. To those who wish to understand contemporary Japan, this is a must-read, as it deals with increasing inequalities and poverty, as well as rising contradictions between labor market dynamics and the welfare system. As a whole, this is an exemplary collective work made highly coherent thanks to the leadership of two excellent editors. " - Sebastien Lechevalier, Associate Professor of Japanese Economy and Society, Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, Paris, France "In today's Japan, a nation-wide debate on welfare reform has been triggered by proposals for a <b>basic</b> <b>income,</b> and a large number of stimulating discussions have taken place between prominent researchers and influential political actors.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} economy-wide impact of {{implementing}} and financing a <b>universal</b> or <b>basic</b> <b>income</b> grant (BIG) in South Africa.

The {{results indicate that the}} required changes in direct and indirect tax rates needed to finance the grant without increasing the government deficit are substantially higher than currently predicted. Furthermore, the alternative of reducing government recurrent expenditure to finance the BIG will undoubtedly undermine other government policy objectives. The paper therefore proposes a shift in the current debate, away from determining which of the individual financing options is preferable, towards an acknowledgement that a 'balanced' approach is likely to provide the only feasible scenario. Furthermore, the impact of the grant on economic growth is found to hinge on its ability to enhance factor productivity. These results suggest that the possibility of South Africa becoming the continent's first welfare state is as likely to rest with the macroeconomic impacts of financing the grant, as with the ability of the grant to address the country's prevailing poverty.

40|$|The {{current social}} {{security}} systems in Europe {{have not been}} able to deal with increased traditional and new risks such as unemployment or work-life balance. One suggested solution to this problem has gained more popular and academic support in recent years: the idea of a <b>universal,</b> unconditional <b>basic</b> <b>income</b> (UBI). This study, therefore, examines whether and how UBI could support social security systems in the UK, Germany and Sweden in order to achieve their aims and fulfil their functions, and thus to improve insufficient social security. Since effectiveness and efficiency describe the functionality of social security systems, the study focuses on these two aspects. These aspects will be used to theoretically discuss expected effects of UBI along with the main aims and functions of key policies in each country in regard to their effectiveness and efficiency. In comparison with current social security schemes in each country, the study demonstrates that UBI is able to deal better with several traditional and new risks, despite problems with higher expectations and living standards. UBI provides basic needs and will especially pull risk away from people in need. Additionally, it alleviates poverty and fosters social cohesion. These achievements help to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the social security systems in the UK, Germany and Sweden...|$|R
