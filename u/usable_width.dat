40|$|Many {{surveying}} {{companies and}} maritime institutions {{are now using}} multibeam systems for their operations, either offshore or in coastal and inland waters. Since the time the first multibeam echosounder appeared (late 1970 s) the technology has advanced enormously. Modern systems now boast far greater angular coverage (typically 120 °- 150 °) and form hundreds of beams. Dual-head multibeam systems can potentially cover the entire sector (180 °) underneath the ship. However surveyors must {{be aware that the}} outer beams of these acoustic systems return the most errors causing that the effective swath width is shorter than what the manufacturers declare. The paper presents the methods of estimating of effective (<b>usable)</b> swath <b>width</b> of dual-head multibeam echosounder EM 3002 D.

40|$|A useful {{method for}} {{eliminating}} the detrimental effect of laser frequency instability on Brillouin signals by employing the self-heterodyne detection of Rayleigh and Brillouin scattering is presented. From {{the analysis of}} Brillouin scattering spectra from fibers with different lengths measured by heterodyne detection, the maximum <b>usable</b> pulse <b>width</b> immune to laser frequency instability is obtained to be about 4 µs in a self-heterodyne detection Brillouin optical time domain reflectometer (BOTDR) system using a broad-band laser with low frequency stability. Applying the self-heterodyne detection of Rayleigh and Brillouin scattering in BOTDR system, we successfully demonstrate that the detrimental effect of laser frequency instability on Brillouin signals can be eliminated effectively. Employing the broad-band laser modulated by a 130 -ns wide pulse driven electro-optic modulator, the observed maximum errors in temperatures measured by the local heterodyne and self-heterodyne detection BOTDR systems are 7. 9 °C and 1. 2 °C, respectively...|$|R
50|$|Since {{refractive}} indices at x-ray wavelengths are {{so close}} to 1, the focal lengths of normal lenses get impractically long. To overcome this lenses with very small radii of curvature are used, and they are stacked in long rows so that the combined focusing power gets appreciable. Since the refractive index is less than 1 for x-rays these lenses must be convex to achieve focusing, contrary to visible light lenses. Radii of curvature are typically less than a millimeter making the <b>usable</b> x-ray beam <b>width</b> at most about 1 mm. To reduce the absorption of x-rays in these stacks, materials with very low atomic number such as beryllium or lithium are typically used. Since the refractive index depends strongly on x-ray wavelength these lenses are highly chromatic and thus only suitable for monochromatic x-rays.|$|R

The significance of his design was a shaft which could control propellers {{at both ends of the}} craft. Among the advantages was superior braking of the vessels, since paddle wheel propulsion systems could not effectively be reversed to slow the craft. Prior to propeller drives, double ended ferries had less <b>usable</b> <b>width</b> because of side wheel propulsion.|$|E

40|$|High target {{utilisation}} sputtering (HiTUS) is a patented remote plasma sputtering {{technique for}} the deposition of thin films. A prototype in-line sputter deposition facility, {{based on the}} existing standard HiTUS technology, has been developed. Materials deposited by both the standard HiTUS and the prototype in-line system where characterised. This was important in examining the key deliverable {{of the new system}} which is uniform deposition of high quality coatings on large (20 cm by 30 cm) substrates. Initially characterisation of the in-line system showed that fully reacted transparent alumina coatings using reactive sputtering could be deposited. The process was found to be reproducible, with a run-to-run variation in peak positions for UV-Vis-IR transmission spectra of less than = 1 %. The process conditions and system were investigated to optimise the system performance. Theoretical and experimental investigations showed that the RF plasma and magnetic field shape both affected the uniformity of coating thickness and optical transmission for reactive sputtering processes. Changes to the system configuration to improve the magnetic field shape based on these findings have increased the <b>usable</b> substrate <b>width</b> from 10 cm to approximate ly 20 cm. Investigating the heating effect of the plasma showed that doubling the RF plasma power (at constant target power) can increase the heat flux to the substrate by a factor of two. For the deposition of tin doped indium oxide (ITO) and aluminium- doped zinc oxide (AZO) increasing the RF plasma power was shown to (i) change the material from amorphous to nanocrystalline, (ii) increase the visible transmission of coatings and (iii) increase the conductivity of the material. These effects are attributed to the increased energy of the plasma species promoting both higher surface mobility and reactivity of adsorbed species.

40|$|This {{manuscript}} describes {{my thesis}} {{work within the}} CMS experiment of the LHC collider. It presents both subjects on which I worked: a detector subject and a data analysis subject. The first subject, detector, is situated {{within the framework of}} the HL-LHC project which plans an increase by a factor five the instantaneous luminosity. Such an increase and the preservation of the high level trigger (HLT) system, generate new constraints on the CMS detector. This is particularly true for the electronic trigger (L 1) system. The CMS collaboration intends to implant this within tracker detector. the associative memorie method is proposed. However, associative memorie method require a clever preselection of electric signals to be <b>usable.</b> The cluster <b>width</b> method is proposed to preselecte electric signals. The optimization of this method, in particular geometrical parameters of modules and thresholds applied for the electric signals preselection, is the result of my own work. It is detailed throughout the part III of this manuscript. The second subject concerns the analysis of data collected by CMS during 2011. This analysis has for objective to look for new particles in the spectre of anti-top top invariant mass. Due to its big mass, close to the electroweak symmetry breaking energy, the top quark plays a important role in numerous extensions of the Standard Model. The observation of narrow resonances in the spectre could be the sign of new particles. The analysis is subdivided into three parts, the selection of top anti-top events, the reconstruction of top anti-top invariant mass and a statistical study to quantify the presence of new physics. The results of this work are limits on the cross-section production of new particles. They are presented in the part IV of this manuscript...|$|R

Some ramps on the market are narrow for the majority of their length, but flare out at the top. This can require additional positioning and can prevent pallets entering the vehicle parallel. Some yard ramps are supplied narrower to allow them to be shipped in a container, ideally however they should be full width.|$|E

5000|$|The Dalton Covered Bridge, {{also called}} the Dalton Bridge, is a {{historic}} covered bridge that carries Joppa Road over the Warner River in Warner, New Hampshire. Its name refers to a nearby resident (first [...] "Mrs. Dalton", then [...] "Widow Dalton") {{at the time of}} its construction. The bridge was built in 1853 by Joshua Sanborn, and its original abutments were built by George Sawyer and Webster Davis; all were local residents. The bridge has a span of 76 ft, with a total bridge length (including portals and roof) of 84 ft.

5000|$|Discussions over {{possible}} {{replacement of}} the bridge also considered changes that a new bridge might incorporate {{in order to make}} the structure more usable for cyclists and pedestrians than the bridge it would replace. The 1925 bridge included no designated space for bicycle traffic, which had grown in more recent decades, and with only a single traffic lane in each direction, there was also very little room for cars to move over when passing bicycles in the roadway. There was a sidewalk on the north side, but its width was a relatively narrow 4 ft and the street light foundations shared space with the sidewalk, making the sidewalk's <b>usable</b> <b>width</b> at those points about 3 feet (36 inches, 91 cm). [...] Allowing for safety clearances, there was less than 2 feet (24 inches, 61 cm) of usable sidewalk.

The gear change was centrally floor mounted. The rear hinged doors were coated on the inside with only a thin plastic lining attached to the metal door panel skin allowing valuable extra internal space. On the early cars the main door windows did not open which attracted criticism, but increased the <b>usable</b> <b>width</b> for the driver and passenger. Instrumentation was very basic with only a speedometer and warning lights for low fuel, main beam, dynamo charging and indicators. The cabriolet fabric roof could be rolled back from the windscreen header rail {{to the top of}} the rear engine cover leaving conventional metal sides above the doors. The 12 volt battery was located at the front of the car, behind the dummy front grill, on a shelf that could be slid out. The spare wheel was stowed in a well under the passenger seat.|$|E
3000|$|... 8 At the Love Parade in Duisburg, the {{capacity}} of the main ramp to and from the festival area was given by the minimum <b>usable</b> <b>width</b> of the ramp. Due to two triangular fence structures, 52, 62 which were apparently not shown in the maps, the effective width of the ramp was only 10.59 meters. According to the expert report, this implies a maximum safe flow of 10.59 meters × 82 persons per meter and minute × 60 minutes = 52, 103 persons per hour. However, the maximum expected flow between 17 : 00 and 18 : 00 was 145, 000 persons per hour, which would require a width of 29.5 meters. Therefore, at the Love Parade in Duisburg, problems with the in- and outflows and a critical accumulation of people had to be expected.|$|E
40|$|Variation in the {{determined}} magnitudes of {{the difference}} in brightness between alternating members of a system of stripes requisite for the elicitation of a threshold response in bees shows that the intensity of excitation, as a function of width of stripe and of intensity of illumination, is determined by the intensity of illumination and by the frequency of occurrence of divisions between bright and less bright bars. The variation of ΔI is limited by the intensity of excitation, so that the curves relating P. E. (ΔI/I) have the same form in relation to I as do the curves for ΔI/I. The limiting rule according to which P. E.

40|$|This thesis relates fluvial {{morphology}} {{to those}} hydraulic conditions {{identified as being}} ideal for the rearing of juvenile Atlantic salmon. The suitability of flow depths and velocities were obtained from published habitat preference curves in order to compute the percent area (percent usable area - PUA) and average width (average <b>usable</b> <b>width</b> - AUW) of reaches providing ideal rearing habitat for juvenile Atlantic salmon at 2 typical summer discharge levels, in the Ste. Marguerite River. By dividing reaches into smaller, morphologic unit's, {{in order to make}} the conditions more uniform, it was noticed that the wetted width and the amplitude of the vertical oscillation of riffles and pools (riffle-pool amplitude) provided the strongest hydraulic and morphologic relationships with the amount of usable habitat at the morphologic unit scale. Two regression models were produced to estimate the AUW of morphologic as a function of hydraulics and morphology, respectively. The historic flood in July 1996 also provided an opportunity to examine some of the impacts of a large magnitude flood on channel morphology: localized bed and bank erosion, the destruction of riparian vegetation, the enhancement and destruction of individual bars, and localized changes in the hydraulic and morphologic character (induced by large sediment inputs) ...|$|E
40|$|The wide, unstable, braided riverbeds of {{the eastern}} South Island, New Zealand, have been {{inhabited}} by a diverse avifauna. Several species including the wrybill breed only on these rivers. Use is restricted mainly to the breeding season from September to December, so this was the critical study period. Previous, behaviourally oriented studies have occurred mainly in the high country catchments where habitat modification is slight. However, substantial bird numbers also occur on lowland riverbeds. These areas are subject to existing or planned water developments which may have negative impacts on the conservation of these habitats and bird species. The principal goal {{of this study was}} to add to the information necessary to conserve lowland riverbed habitat within multiple use planning strategies. Specific objectives associated with assessing breeding and feeding requirements were therefore hydrologically oriented. Study areas were chosen on the lower Rakaia and lower Ashley rivers. Both are braided but have markedly different flow regimes. The Rakaia is snowfed and has peak flows occurring during the breeding season. The Ashley is primarily rainfed and has a declining breeding season flow regime. Wrybills, black-fronted terns, banded dotterels, South Island pied oystercatchers, and pied stilts breed in these areas. The first two of these were selected as indicator species. It was assumed that because of their restricted habitat needs, flow requirements recommended to meet their needs would also meet those of most other species. Banded dotterels were also studied because of their close taxonomic relationship and overlapping distribution with wrybills. South Island pied oystercatchers and pied stilts were chosen to check the validity of the approach. Breeding, nest site requirements, microhabitat preferences for foraging, diets, home ranges and food supply were studied. Wrybill time-budgets were examined, and the incremental approach to impact assessment was applied to wrybill foraging needs. Breeding success for all species was dependent on the flow regime. In 1982 wrybill fledging success was moderate on the Rakaia, whereas in 1983 it was very low. Conversely, in both years fledging success was very high on the Ashley. This variability resulted from serious flooding on the Rakaia in 1983 which effected all species. Wrybills have nest site characteristics most closely approximating a habitat specialist, while the other species should be considered habitat generalists. Nests are generally close to water, near minor braids, and on non-vegetated shingle substrates. On average there is a higher chance of nests being flooded on the Rakaia than on the Ashley where predation is more likely to reduce nesting success. Vegetation encroachment threatens nest site provision and floods are presently the only natural regular of exotic plants such as lupin. Banded dotterel home ranges were significantly smaller than wrybills, and on an intra-specific basis were smaller on the Ashley. A correlation existed between home range size and habitat quality, so that small wrybill home ranges were dominated by the occurrence of productive minor braids, and larger ones by less productive major channels. Time-budgets provided further insights into the influence of hydrological factors on wrybill ecology. Wrybill time-budgets appear to be inflexible because a high proportion of time is devoted to foraging, with relatively little time available for other activities. Resource depression on the Rakaia in 1983 lessened the chances for wrybills to breed successfully because sufficient food could not be gathered to provide for breeding energy needs. This did not occur on the Ashley River where flows were generally more stable. From a management viewpoint, development strategies which lead to greater flow fluctuations will have a detrimental impact on wrybills. The foraging patterns for all species except black-fronted terns were examined. There was a general preference for aquatic habitats, particularly those associated with minor braids and disconnected pools. Depth and substrate use were studied in detail for wrybills and banded dotterels. Wrybills displayed consistent use patterns between rivers, which reflected specialisation in habitat use. Banded dotterel habitat use varied considerably. Diet was studied by faecal analysis. Both wrybills and banded dotterels fed on invertebrates of aquatic and terrestrial origin. For wrybills it was noticeable that Ephemeroptera larvae did not dominate the diet as had previously been reported for high country catchments. Coleoptera, Hemiptera, and Ephemeroptera were important on the Rakaia with Trichoptera replacing Ephemeroptera larvae on the Ashley. Banded dotterels were more reliant on Coleoptera and Hemiptera on both rivers. Pitfall trapping results showed that terrestrial invertebrate availability was dependent on the proximity of water. Fewer floods on the Ashley led to a more consistent food supply on that river. This helps explain the greater bird density on this river. Severe flooding in 1983 appeared to seriously depress aquatic invertebrate densities on the Rakaia. The incremental approach to impact assessment was applied to wrybill foraging requirements. Depth, substrate, and water velocity preferences were included within a weighted usable area model already developed for fisheries use on the Rakaia River. Over the range of median to low flows studied, weighted usable area increased with declining discharge. A simplified <b>usable</b> <b>width</b> approach was applied to a highly braided section of the Ashley River. Here, <b>usable</b> <b>width</b> declined with falling discharges. This inter-basin difference could be explained with reference to the braiding pattern of each river. The main study objectives were achieved, but the indicator species management approach was of limited value in areas other than nest site requirements. Pied stilts and South Island pied oystercatchers fed at greater depths than wrybills, and often used different microhabitats. However, for foraging, wrybills need appeared adequate indicators of banded dotterel requirements...|$|E
