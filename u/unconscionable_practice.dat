50|$|A {{focus of}} Legal Aid in its {{beginning}} years {{was working for}} passage of legislation aimed at <b>unconscionable</b> <b>practices</b> of businesses that preyed on low-income persons. Legal Aid's first annual report refers to a measure to regulate moneylenders who were charging poor people interest rates of 60% to 200%. A Legal Aid trustee was the principal author of a 1910 bill to create the first municipal court in Ohio. Creation of that court {{eventually led to the}} demise of the exploitive Justice of the Peace courts in the state.|$|R

40|$|The {{practices}} of marketeers in the Queensland property market {{have been the}} subject of intense media interest and have caused widespread consumer concern. In response to these concerns the Queensland government has amended the Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act 2000 (Qld) (“the Act”). Significant changes to the Act were introduced by the Property Agents and Motor Dealers Amendment Act 2001 (Qld) (“the amending Act”). Implicit in the introduction of the amending Act was recognition that marketeers had altered their operating tactics to avoid the requirements of the Act. The amendments enhance regulation and are intended to capture the conduct of all persons involved in <b>unconscionable</b> <b>practices</b> that have lead to dysfunction in certain sectors of the Queensland property market. The amending Act is focussed on a broad regulatory response rather than further regulation of specific occupations in the property sale process as it was recognised that the approach of industry regulation had proven to be inadequate to curtail marketeering practices and to protect the interests of consumers. As well as providing for increased disclosure obligations on real estate agents, property developers and lawyers together with an extension of the 5 business day cooling-off period to all contracts (other than auction contracts) for the sale of residential property in Queensland; in an endeavour to further protect consumer interests the amending Act provides for increased jurisdiction and powers to the Property Agents and Motor Dealers Tribunal (“the Tribunal”) enabling the Tribunal to deal with claims against marketeers. These provisions commenced on the date of assent (21 September 2001). The aim of this article is to examine the circumstances in which marketeers will contravene the legislation and the ramifications...|$|R
40|$|N {{the absence}} of {{meaningful}} government regulation of the United States food industry, public health advo-cates are turning to litigation {{as a means to}} curb the obesity epidemic. The private right of legal action has {{played a critical role in}} protecting United States con-sumers from harmful products by raising public awareness, increasing self-policing by industry, and ultimately curb-ing practices harmful to consumers. Asbestos litigation curtailed use of the material and compensated thousands of injured consumers. Tobacco litigation, generally ridiculed in its first four decades, helped turn public opinion against the tobacco industry in the mid- 1990 s, forcing manufacturers to stop denying the dangers of smoking, to end the use of cartoon characters, and to discontinue certain other <b>unconscionable</b> marketing <b>practices,</b> as well as contribute hundreds of millions of dol-lars to corrective advertising campaigns.

5000|$|On December 18, 2015, Judge Bariso {{granted a}} {{permanent}} injunction after an agreement {{by both parties}} that required JONAH to shut down entirely and prohibited founder Arthur Goldberg and counselor Alan Downing from engaging in any form of conversion therapy in New Jersey. The jury in the case found unanimously on June 25 that by offering services claiming could turn gay people straight, JONAH committed consumer fraud and engaged in <b>unconscionable</b> commercial <b>practices.</b> Under the agreed to injunction and settlement, the defendants will pay the full [...] in damages awarded by the jury to compensate the plaintiffs for the fees they paid to JONAH and for remedial mental health counseling for one plaintiff. The proposed judgment includes a $3.5 million award of legal fees. The plaintiffs agreed to accept an undisclosed portion of that award, but the defendants will be liable for the full amount if they violate the agreement. JONAH is required to shut down all of its operations within 30 days after the order is entered, and its websites and online listservs must be removed. JONAH also will have to liquidate its assets and permanently dissolve as a corporate entity within six months. As part of the settlement, JONAH will not appeal the jury verdict.|$|R

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{concerned}} how crop water use efficiency (WUE) responds to climate change. Most of existing researches have emphasized the impact of single climate factor but have paid less attention {{to the effect of}} developed agronomic measures on crop WUE. Based on the long-term field observations/experiments data, we investigated the changing responses of crop WUE to climate variables (temperature and precipitation) and agronomic practices (fertilization and cropping patterns) in the semi-arid area of northern China (SAC) during two periods, 1983 - 1999 and 2000 - 2010 (drier and warmer). Our results suggest that crop WUE was an intrinsical system sensitive to climate change and agronomic measures. Crops tend to reach the maximum WUE (WUEmax) in warm-dry environment while reach the stable minimum WUE (WUEmin) in warm-wet environment, with a difference between WUEmax and WUEmin ranging from 29. 0 %- 55. 5 %. Changes in temperature and precipitation in the past three decades jointly enhanced crop WUE by 8. 1 %- 30. 6 %. Elevated fertilizer and rotation cropping would increase crop WUE by 5. 6 - 11. 0 % and 19. 5 - 92. 9 %, respectively. These results indicate crop has the resilience by adjusting WUE, which is not only able to respond to subsequent periods of favorable water balance but also to tolerate the drought stress, and reasonable agronomic practices could enhance this resilience. However, this capacity would break down under impact of climate changes and <b>unconscionable</b> agronomic <b>practices</b> (e. g. excessive N/P/K fertilizer or traditional continuous cropping). Based on the findings in this study, a conceptual crop WUE model is constructed to indicate the threshold of crop resilience, which could help the farmer develop appropriate strategies in adapting the adverse impacts of climate warming...|$|R
