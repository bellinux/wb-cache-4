40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to present a survey to be applied to professors of public universities, to identify the factors that benefit or hinder the <b>university-industry</b> <b>relation.</b> Hence, this research studies some elements that integrate the variables: Knowledge management, technology management, and technology transfer; to define the existence of a relation between these variables and the industry necessities of innovation. This study is exploratory, descriptive and non-experimental. The research question is: What is the impact of the knowledge management, the technology management, and the technology transfer, made by administrative support areas of the public universities, in the industries innovation? Thus, literature review was made to identify some elements that should be considered to design a survey that allows to obtain valid information to the study variables.

However, assessing impacts of shifts toward a more proprietary university is inherently complex because of potential countervailing or mediating factors within working relationships. From interviews with 84 biological scientists at nine universities we find scientists view UIRRS and university intellectual property (IP) policies in complex and often conflicting ways. For example, university scientists believe UIRRs are valuable for increasing contact with scientists, but are problematic because working with industry can restrict communication among scientists. Also scientists believe university IP policies should shield their work from opportunistic behavior {{and at the same time}} be designed to attract industry partners. In addition scientists believe universities use their IP policies primarily as revenue raising vehicles and secondarily to address public good issues such as technology transfer.

40|$|Why do regions post {{different}} {{growth rates}} {{and differences in}} technological progress? Knowledge creation and knowledge spillovers are {{an important element in}} stimulating economic development. Recent empirical studies have shown that knowledge spillovers positively affect technological change and economic growth. Other studies have shown that knowledge spillovers do not occur automatically, hence, it is less clear which mechanisms facilitate and foster knowledge flows. This paper focuses on the exploitation of opportunities and commercialization of knowledge, namely the transformation of knowledge into products, processes and organizations, and their contribution to regional economic growth. The degree of knowledge exploitation may differ across regions because the level of research and development activities varies, incumbent firms might not exploit new opportunities to the full extent, and new knowledge generated in research institutions and universities is hardly translated into new products or services. It may be argued that a knowledge filter exists limiting the total conversion of knowledge into new products, processes and organizations (for details, see Acs, Audretsch, Braunerhjelm & Carlsson, 2003). This paper introduces entrepreneurship and <b>university-industry</b> <b>relations</b> as mechanisms for knowledge spillovers and determinants of economic growth. Entrepreneurial activity can be assumed as a mechanism by which knowledge spillover occurs. Many radical innovations have been introduced by new firms rather than by incumbents, because the set-up of one’s own business might be the most promising possibility to commercialize knowledge (Audretsch, 1995). <b>University-industry</b> <b>relations</b> may be another mechanism facilitating the exploitation of knowledge and the flow of ideas (Mansfield, 1991, 1998). If the generated knowledge at universities is transferred via research partnerships it may accelerate technology transfer and enable firms to develop new products and process (Cohen, Nelsen & Walsh, 2002, Mansfield 1991 and 1998). The empirical modeling framework develops a regional model of economic growth and analyzes if the region’s absorptive capacity, entrepreneurship and <b>university-industry</b> <b>relations</b> drive economic growth. The results of the empirical analysis suggest that new ventures and partnerships between university and industry amplify the permeability of the knowledge filter and thus spur economic growth. The paper also gives an outlook and discusses implications for public policy to stimulate entrepreneurship and <b>university-industry</b> <b>relations.</b> ...|$|E

The empirical analysis is based on a survey of 349 lecturers from Bolivian public universities, which inquired into aspects of <b>university-industry</b> <b>relations</b> (UIR). Although the results indicate that lecturers are in favour of relations with firms, there are several barriers to such relationships, such as lack of institutional support, generally unfavourable atmosphere in universities, and an industrial structure comprising few firms in knowledge-intensive sectors and firms with low absorptive capacity. In the context of Bolivia, unlike what occurs in developed countries, UIR have been configured around scientifically unimportant activities which has had a negative effect on the consolidation of research. Este artículo examina cómo se sitúa la comunidad académica boliviana en el debate sobre la producción y transferencia de conocimiento al sector productivo y las implicaciones que tiene en la transformación universitaria latinoamericana. El análisis empírico se basa en una encuesta contestada por 349 docentes de universidades públicas bolivianas, en la que se indagaban diversos aspectos sobre las relaciones universidad-empresa (RUE). Aunque los resultados indican una actitud favorable de los docentes para relacionarse con las empresas existen diversos obstáculos que limitan el desarrollo de dicha relación, tales como un soporte institucional deficiente, un ambiente universitario desfavorable y un tejido industrial con pocas empresas en sectores intensivos en conocimiento y con una baja capacidad de absorción. En el contexto analizado, a diferencia de lo que ocurre en los países desarrollados, las RUE se ha configurado en torno a actividades científicamente poco relevantes lo que a su vez ha incidido negativamente en la consolidación de la investigación como actividad académica.
