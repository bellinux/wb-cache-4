The impressive landscape of the North Pennines - from High Force on the River Tees to the sweeping valley of High Cup Gill above Dufton - are the product of millions of years of geological processes. The worldwide significance of the geology found in the area was recognised in 2003 when the AONB became Britain's first European Geopark. A year later the area become one of the founding members of the UNESCO-assisted Global Geopark family and in 2015 it was accorded official status as a <b>UNESCO</b> <b>Global</b> <b>Geopark.</b> Geoparks are areas with outstanding geological heritage where this is being used to support sustainable development.|$|E

40|$|Extract] With geotourism as an {{expression}} of a growing trend towards the natural as well as cultural landscape (Pforr and Megerle, 2006) geoparks appear to hold the future for tourism in designated areas on a global scale. One of these geoparks is the Vulkaneifel which covers approximately 2000 km 2 in the German State of Rhineland-Palatinate bordering on Belgium and Luxembourg in the west and on the Rhine in the east (Figures CS 16. 1 and CS 16. 2). In 2004 the Vulkaneifel European Geopark was officially recognized as a <b>UNESCO</b> <b>global</b> <b>geopark,</b> which is a significant step up from the original regional geopark designation as the guidelines and criteria defined by UNESCO are quite stringent and are evaluated by an international team of experts (UNESCO, 2006 a) ...|$|E
30|$|Let me {{recall that}} the {{relationship}} between ICGdR and UNESCO started when ICGdR together with Shimane University established UNESCO chair as a centre of excellence focusing on the nexus of the Geoenvironmental Disaster Reduction Improving the Relationship between Geoenvironment and Society in 2017. UNESCO participated the ICGdR annual meeting (15 ISGdR) last August 2017 in Shimane, Japan to discuss about the issues on geohazards risk and prevention measures. Later, Flavia Schlegel, our Assistant-Director General for Natural Sciences visited Shimane University for the celebration event of newly approved UNESCO Chair on Geoenvironmental Disaster Reduction in November 2017. She is very satisfied with the active engagement of Shimane University and ICGdR on the geohazard disaster risk reduction. She was also impressed with the local community living with the geo-sites in Oki <b>UNESCO</b> <b>Global</b> <b>Geopark,</b> where she visited during her stay in Shimane.|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of trace metals and metalloids, and the Sr-isotopic systematics {{were applied to}} 16 must samples from vines growing in the Sesia Val Grande Supervolcano <b>UNESCO</b> <b>Global</b> <b>Geopark</b> in the northern Piedmont Region (Italy), a land worldwide famous {{for the production of}} quality Nebbiolo-based red wines. Twenty-four elements were measured in each sample with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results indicate a wide variability in trace element concentration in musts from the different vineyards. In particular, Rb and Sr reach their maximum at 5110 and 694 Âµg Lâ 8 ̆ 89 ̆ 21, respectively, reflecting the geological nature of the magmatic bedrocks. Fe, Cu, Pb and Ba concentrations reach 3118, 1200, 130 and 720 Âµg Lâ 8 ̆ 89 ̆ 21, respectively, suggesting a source from iron oxide, Pbâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 Zn and Ba ores associated to the volcanic activity. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio is in the range 0. 711608 â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 30. 718160, showing a highly radiogenic signature which is uncommon in must/wine. This is consistent with the high 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopic ratio of the old rhyolitic bedrocks. Furthermore, the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio in musts linearly correlates with the corresponding 87 Rb/ 86 Sr ratio, reflecting the Rb and 87 Sr release from primary minerals during pedogenesis and matching the initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio of the parent bedrocks magmatic reservoir, thus assuming importance for authenticity assessment...|$|E
