5|$|Generally, in {{cabinets}} or {{display cases}} that are entirely or partially made of wood, the hydrolysis of acetyl groups in the wood hemicelluloses creates acetic acid. The {{rate at which the}} acetic acid is produced is proportional to the concentration of esters in the wood, the humidity, the temperature, and the overall acidity of the environment. Acidic fumes can also be released from formaldehyde which can occur in wood as a degradation product of lignin. Acidic fumes can also be given off from ubiquitous formaldehyde resins (commonly <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> resins).|$|E

25|$|Plywood for {{indoor use}} {{generally}} uses the less expensive <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> glue, which has limited water resistance, while outdoor and marine-grade plywood are designed to withstand moisture, and use a water-resistant phenol-formaldehyde glue to prevent delamination and to retain strength in high humidity.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the original Bakelite material, these companies eventually made {{a wide range of}} other products, many of which were marketed under the brand name [...] "Bakelite plastics". [...] These included other types of cast phenolic resins similar to Catalin, and <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> resins, which could be made in brighter colors than polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride.|$|E
2500|$|... {{n-butanol}} is {{an intermediate}} {{in the production}} of butyl acrylate, butyl acetate, dibutyl phthalate, dibutyl sebacate, and other butyl esters, butyl ethers such as ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, di- and triethylene glycol monobutyl ether, and the corresponding butyl ether acetates. Other industrial uses include the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, polymers, pyroxylin plastics, herbicide esters, printing [...] (e.g., 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T) and butyl xanthate. It is also used as a diluent/reactant in the manufacture of <b>urea–formaldehyde</b> and melamine–formaldehyde resins.|$|E
2500|$|For early {{production}} aircraft, {{the structural}} assembly adhesive was Casein-based. At a later stage, this {{was replaced by}} [...] "Aerolite", a synthetic <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> type, which was more durable. To provide for the edge joints for the fuselage halves, zones near the outer edges of the shells had their balsa sandwich cores replaced by much stronger inner laminations of birch plywood. For the bonding together of the two halves ("boxing up"), a longitudinal cut was machined into these edges. The profile of this cut {{was a form of}} V-groove. Part of the edge bonding process also included adding further longitudinal plywood lap-strips {{on the outside of the}} shells. The half-bulkheads of each shell were bonded to their corresponding pair in a similar way.|$|E
2500|$|Slow- and controlled-release involve only 0.15% (562,000 tons) of the {{fertilizer}} market (1995). Their utility {{stems from}} the fact that fertilizers are subject to antagonistic processes. [...] In addition to their providing the nutrition to plants, excess fertilizers can be poisonous to the same plant. [...] Competitive with the uptake by plants is the degradation or loss of the fertilizer. Microbes degrade many fertilizers, e.g., by immobilization or oxidation. [...] Furthermore, fertilizers are lost by evaporation or leaching. [...] Most slow-release fertilizers are derivatives of urea, a straight fertilizer providing nitrogen. Isobutylidenediurea ("IBDU") and <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> slowly convert in the soil to free urea, which is rapidly uptaken by plants. [...] IBDU is a single compound with the formula (CH3)2CHCH(NHC(O)NH2)2 whereas the urea-formaldehydes consist of mixtures of the approximate formula (HOCH2NHC(O)NH)nCH2.|$|E
2500|$|Although it is {{generally}} accepted that EU law has primacy, not all EU laws give citizens standing to bring claims: that is, not all EU laws have [...] "direct effect". In Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen it was held that {{the provisions of the}} Treaties (and EU Regulations) are directly effective, if they are (1) clear and unambiguous (2) unconditional, and (3) did not require EU or national authorities to take further action to implement them. Van Gend en Loos, a postal company, claimed that what is now TFEU article 30 prevented the Dutch Customs Authorities charging tariffs, when it imported <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> plastics from Germany to the Netherlands. After a Dutch court made a reference, the Court of Justice held that even though the Treaties did not [...] "expressly" [...] confer a right on citizens or companies to bring claims, they could do so. Historically, international treaties had only allowed states to have legal claims for their enforcement, but the Court of Justice proclaimed [...] "the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law". Because article 30 clearly, unconditionally and immediately stated that no quantitative restrictions could be placed on trade, without a good justification, Van Gend en Loos could recover the money it paid for the tariff. EU Regulations are the same as Treaty provisions in this sense, because as TFEU article 288 states, they are 'directly applicable in all Member States'. Member states come under a duty not to replicate Regulations in their own law, in order to prevent confusion. For instance, in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that Italy had breached a duty under the Treaties, both by failing to operate a scheme to pay farmers a premium to slaughter cows (to reduce dairy overproduction), and by reproducing the rules in a decree with various additions. [...] "Regulations", held the Court of Justice, [...] "come into force solely by virtue of their publication" [...] and implementation could have the effect of [...] "jeopardizing their simultaneous and uniform application in the whole of the Union". On the other hand, some Regulations may themselves expressly require implementing measures, in which case those specific rules should be followed.|$|E

50|$|<b>Urea-formaldehyde</b> {{insulation}} releases poisonous formaldehyde gas, causing {{indoor air}} quality problems. The chemical bond between the urea and formaldehyde is weak, resulting in degradation of the foam cells and emission of toxic formaldehyde gas into the home over time. Furthermore, some manufacturers used excess formaldehyde to ensure chemical bonding {{of all of the}} urea. Any leftover formaldehyde would escape after the mixing. Most states outlawed it in the early 1980s after dangers to building occupants were discovered. However emissions are highest when the <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> is new and decrease over time, so houses that have had <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> within their walls for years or decades do not require remediation.|$|E
