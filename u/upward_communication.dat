40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the second most common cause of cancer-related death amongst Australian women. Regular {{screening}} mammography {{is the best way to}} facilitate early detection of breast cancer, which in turn increases the chances of survival. Although BreastScreen Australia offers free biennial mammograms to women aged 40 and above (particularly targeting women between the ages of 50 - 69), many eligible women fail to attend for regular mammography. Mass media campaigns that have aimed to promote mammography to eligible women have not been sufficient to raise the mammography screening rate from the current 57. 1 % to the target 70 %. The central premise of this thesis is that interpersonal influence may complement the mass media approach to mammography promotion, and serve to increase the national screening rate. In particular, in light of previous research that has identified the family has as a potential vehicle for delivering health promotion messages, the potential role that a daughter could play in influencing her mother’s health behaviour was given particular attention in the current project. Everyday interpersonal communication initiated by the daughter directed at the mother is referred to as ‘upward family communication’ in this thesis. <b>Upward</b> family <b>communication</b> about mammography is a novel approach to mammography promotion, and the purpose of the research presented in this thesis was to explore the viability of this strategy. Family Communication Patterns theory describes four family types based on two dimensions: the conversation orientation and the conformity orientation. This theoretical framework is used in the current project to inform predictions about <b>upward</b> family <b>communication</b> about mammography, particularly in relation to identifying which mother-daughter dyads are likely to engage in such communication effectively. The Revised Family Communication Patterns (RFCP) instrument, used to classify families according to type, was modified as part of the current project for use specifically with mother-daughter dyads. Tailoring the instrument for use specifically with mother-daughter dyads has not previously been attempted, and the data from this project indicate that the internal consistency of the instrument was not compromised in this process. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight mother-daughter pairs to explore the nature of existing communication patterns within this relationship, and the modified RFCP instrument was able to differentiate between mother-daughter dyads with different communication patterns. The data from these interviews indicate that while <b>upward</b> family <b>communication</b> about health is commonplace within these dyads, mammography is not likely to be a spontaneous topic of conversation initiated by daughters. Thus, two daughter-targeted interventions were piloted that aimed to predict and facilitate <b>upward</b> family <b>communication</b> about mammography. With the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) providing the theoretical background, a volitional intervention using implementation intentions and a motivational intervention using counterfactual thinking were piloted with independent samples. These studies represent the first attempts at using the TPB to predict and facilitate <b>upward</b> family <b>communication</b> about mammography and at applying implementation intentions and counterfactual thinking to this communication behaviour. Young women who participated in the implementation intention (volitional) intervention were significantly more likely to have initiated a conversation with their mothers about mammography within an eight-week period than controls (N = 116). In contrast, young women who participated in the counterfactual thinking (motivational) intervention were no more likely to have initiated the specified conversation than controls (N = 131). In both studies, the TPB variables predicted both intention and behaviour with some accuracy, thus contributing to the body of knowledge about the utility of this theoretical model. Notably, in both studies, young women reported that initiating a conversation about mammography with their mother had positive consequences, such as increases in knowledge, and an elevated likelihood that their mother would have a mammogram. This result provided evidence for daughters’ willingness to engage in an <b>upward</b> family <b>communication</b> mammography promotion strategy, and for the effectiveness of this novel approach. The primary contribution of the project presented in this thesis is the provision of convergent evidence for the viability and effectiveness of an <b>upward</b> family <b>communication</b> strategy to promote mammography to target women. The current project has also presented a means for identifying mother-daughter dyads most amenable to this novel mammography promotion approach using the predictions of Family Communication Patterns Theory. Further, the results of this project have demonstrated that the TPB model has utility for predicting <b>upward</b> family <b>communication</b> about mammography, and has potential for guiding interventions aimed at facilitating this behaviour...|$|R

The decision making area is expanded by allowing lower-level employees to be involved in policy-making but is limited by the framework given to them from upper-level management. Major policy decisions are still left to those at the top, who have some awareness of the problems that occur at lower levels. This creates mainly downward communication from supervisors to employees with little <b>upward</b> <b>communication,</b> causing subordinates to be somewhat suspicious of communication coming from the top. The managers at the top feel more responsibility towards organizational goals than those employees at the bottom, who feel very little responsibility. This contrast in feelings toward responsibility can result in a conflict and negative attitudes with the organization's goals. Subordinates in this system can become hostile towards each other because of the competition that is created between them. Satisfaction among workers is low to moderately-low and productivity is measured at fair to good.|$|E

40|$|This {{study has}} {{researched}} {{the dynamics of}} <b>upward</b> <b>communication</b> within organisations through the rubric of ingratiation theory (Jones, 1964) and impression management (Goffman, 1955). <b>Upward</b> <b>communication</b> was explored via in-depth case studies, in a hundred and five semi-structured interviews across four organisations in Scotland. A qualitative, interpretive methodology was used. The interviews probed how <b>upward</b> <b>communication</b> was transmitted and investigated how ingratiation theory and impression management dynamics could impact on it by exploring the story telling (Gabriel, 200) and sense making approaches (Weick, 1995) employed by interviewees. The data was then tabulated on Excel sheets, using the Framework Analysis (Swallow et al., 2002), thus establishing an easily referenced, perfectly structured database. Finally, the data was sifted, perused, distilled and analysed interpretively. It was found that <b>upward</b> <b>communication</b> was shaped by processes such as downsizing, management and leadership styles, the power dynamics of the organisation, issues of publicness, and the perceived physical and psychological distance of the superior from the subordinate. Finally, the components of opinion conformity (a factor common to ingratiation theory and impression management), employee silence (Morrison and Milliken, 2000, Milliken, 2003), and cynicism (Fleming and Spicer, 2002; Naus, 2004, 2007) were identified as the most significant syndromes that impacted on the levels of <b>upward</b> <b>communication</b> within the four organisations.

While some research claims that email, due to absence of non-verbal cues, encourages informal language, other research has claimed the opposite. However, email technology also allows writers {{to plan and}} revise messages before sending them, thus affording the opportunity to edit not only for grammar and mechanics, but also for pragmatic clarity and politeness. The study examines email requests sent by native and non-native English speaking graduate students to faculty at a major American university {{over a period of}} several semesters and applies Blum-Kulka, House, and Kasper’s (1989) speech act analysis framework – quantitatively to distinguish levels of directness, i. e. pragmatic clarity; and qualitatively to compare syntactic and lexical politeness devices, the request perspectives, and the specific linguistic request realization patterns preferred by native and non-native speakers. Results show that far more requests are realized through direct strategies as well as hints than conventionally indirect strategies typically found in comparative speech act studies. Politeness conventions in email, a text-only medium with little guidance in the academic institutional hierarchy, appear to be a work in progress, and native speakers demonstrate greater resources in creating e-polite messages to their professors than nonnative speakers.

40|$|AbstractCommunication {{climate is}} of {{paramount}} importance in an organization as it contributes to the effectiveness and success of an organization. The communication climate of an organization may influence the atmosphere in the organization which either encourages or hinders horizontal, <b>upward</b> or downward <b>communication</b> among the employees. In organizations with defensive climates, employees have the tendency to abstain from communicating their needs, as they become very cautious in making statements, and may have low level of motivation. On the other hand, organizations with supportive environments encourage active participation, healthy exchange of information and constructive conflict resolution. Instilling collaborative communication climate in an organization however requires effective management of conflicts. This paper reports a study conducted in a high risk work environment of an oil and gas company, in which the personnel have to work with volatile chemicals and heavy machines. The communicative behaviors in such hazardous environments are not to be taken lightly as communication errors could lead to fatal incidences. The study thus investigates the impact of communication conflict strategies used by the personnel on the overall organizational communication climate in a high-risk workplace environment. A set of questionnaires were administered to employees at all levels in the organization working at the administrative office and at the gas plant. One hundred and twenty five employees responded to the questionnaire, which attributed to more than fifty percent of the total population. The findings discuss the impact of various communicative strategies used in conflict management on the organizational communication climate. The overall findings suggest that conflicts management is related to the roles the personnel play in the organization. In assuming the leadership role, the top management's approach to conflicts include confrontational and compromise, instead of non-confrontation and control, which have a degree of impact on the communication supportive climate.
