5|$|Chao have {{appeared}} in many games in the series, beginning with Sonic Adventure in 1998. They <b>usually</b> <b>take</b> the form of digital pets, but have also played parts in the story and figured into other gameplay elements. Most notably, the character Cream the Rabbit has a Chao named Cheese, whom she uses to attack enemies. They have also appeared in games outside the series, the Sonic the Hedgehog comics, and the Sonic X anime, {{as well as being}} featured in promotions and merchandise. Critics have given mixed opinions on Chao and their integration into Sonic gameplay, generally praising their worth as a diversion but criticizing Chao minigames' low interactivity.|$|E

5|$|Glasses {{and certain}} types of {{plastics}} are commonly welded materials. Unlike metals, which have a specific melting point, glasses and plastics have a melting range, called the glass transition. When heating the solid material into this range, it will generally become softer and more pliable. When it crosses through the glass transition, {{it will become a}} very thick, sluggish, viscous liquid. Typically, this viscous liquid will have very little surface tension, becoming a sticky, honey-like consistency, so welding can <b>usually</b> <b>take</b> place by simply pressing two melted surfaces together. The two liquids will generally mix and join at first contact. Upon cooling through the glass transition, the welded piece will solidify as one solid piece of amorphous material.|$|E
5|$|If a large insect is {{struggling}} in a web, Portia does not <b>usually</b> <b>take</b> the insect, but waits {{for up to}} a day until the insect stops struggling, even if the prey is thoroughly stuck. When an insect stuck in a web owned by P. labiata, P. schultzi or any regional variant of P. fimbriata, and next to a web spider's web, the web spider sometimes enters the Portia′s web, and the Portia pursues and catches the web spider.|$|E

5|$|The Mercury Prize, {{formerly}} the Mercury Music Prize and currently {{known as the}} Nationwide Mercury Prize for sponsorship reasons, is an annual music prize awarded for the best album from the United Kingdom or Ireland. It was established by BPI and BARD (the British Association of Record Dealers) in 1992 {{as an alternative to}} the industry-dominated BRIT Awards. The awards <b>usually</b> <b>take</b> place in September, but nominated albums are announced in July. Nominations are chosen by a selected panel of musicians, music executives, journalists and other figures in the music industry in the UK and Ireland. Winehouse received two nominations.|$|E

5|$|Chris Beveridge's {{review for}} Fandom Post was highly {{positive}} towards the anime series, {{calling it a}} dark horse contender {{as one of their}} top new anime series of the year. Beveridge praised the technical and fundamental aspects of magic in the series for breaking the supernatural approach other works <b>usually</b> <b>take</b> and liked the potential impact it could have on future events. However, while the reviewer liked the series' technicality, they noted it will frustrate certain viewers in that aspect. Richard Eisenbeis, writing for Kotaku, liked the characters, story, the complex and technical magic system, and mysteries. However, Eisenbeis criticized the exposition, citing it to be poorly timed, heavy, and failing to explain things with better clarity. He concluded his review by writing how the anime might have been great if a different director or screenwriting was hired.|$|E

5|$|Players {{can only}} carry {{a limited number}} of weapons since the {{inventory}} features a 4-slot system in which single hand held pistols <b>usually</b> <b>take</b> a weapon slot whereas heavy weapons like sniper rifles or rocket launchers can take up to three weapon slots. The player's movement speed is also altered by the weight of the weapon the player is currently holding. Besides the primary function, all of the weapons in Perfect Dark Zero have one or two additional function modes that generally grant the player with special abilities. For example, the Shockwave Rifle features an X-ray function which allows the player to see enemies through walls, while the Plasma Rifle has a cloak function that renders the player character invisible to enemies at cost of its batteries. Some weapons also feature more unorthodox secondary functions. For instance, the Laptop Gun can be deployed as a sentry gun, while the SuperDragon assault rifle can launch bouncing grenades.|$|E
5|$|The American {{black duck}} is a habitat generalist {{as it is}} {{associated}} with tidal marshes and present throughout the year in salt marshes from the Gulf of Maine to coastal Virginia. It usually prefers freshwater and coastal wetlands throughout northeastern America, including brackish marshes, estuaries and edges of backwater ponds and rivers lined by speckled alder. It also inhabits beaver ponds, shallow lakes with sedges and reeds, bogs in open boreal and mixed hardwood forests, as well as forested swamps. Populations in Vermont have also been found in glacial kettle ponds surrounded by bog mats. During winter, the American black duck mostly inhabits brackish marshes bordering bays, agricultural marshes, flooded timber, agricultural fields, estuaries and riverine areas. Ducks <b>usually</b> <b>take</b> shelter from hunting and other disturbances by moving to brackish and fresh impoundments on conservation land.|$|E
5|$|The Guianan cock-of-the-rock has {{distinctive}} territorial markings. Males <b>usually</b> <b>take</b> {{dominance of}} an area on the ground, although they sometimes they occupy middle strata in forests. They make their characteristic marking by clearing out debris from the ground, including twigs, leaves, and pellets. This area is called a “court”. Quality of courts {{are known to have}} some influence on mate choice. The court quality is determined by the territory density and location to the center of activity in the lek. The reason for the focus on the center of activity in the lek is that successful males tended to own courts in the most densely clustered lek areas. Guianan courts are commonly found in the Guianan Shield, a forested region in northeastern South America.|$|E

5|$|As of 2010, {{the school}} follows the National Curriculum in Years 7–11 {{and offers a}} broad range of GCSEs (national exams taken by {{students}} aged 14–16) and A-levels (national exams taken by pupils aged 16–18). The school has no affiliation with a particular religious denomination, but religious education is given throughout the school, and boys may opt to take the subject as part of their GCSE course. Although morning assemblies take place and are Christian in nature, they are non-denominational. Students participate in a number of educational visits and excursions throughout their school career and Year Eleven students participate in a nine-day work experience programme. The curriculum comprises English and Drama, Mathematics, French, Latin, History, Geography, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Art, Music, Design Technology, Religious Education, Physical Education (P.E.) and Games and Personal, Social and Health Education (P.S.H.E.). In the second year German is added and in Mathematics, students are divided based on their ability. The use of Information Technology is central to all teaching and is taught as a discrete subject in Years 7 and 8. Boys <b>usually</b> <b>take</b> ten subjects for GCSE, English (Language and Literature), Mathematics, a foreign language, all three separate sciences or Dual Certificate Science, supplemented by three other subjects from those listed above.|$|E
5|$|During investigations, which <b>usually</b> <b>take</b> {{place before}} or in between trial sessions, the player gathers {{information}} and evidence {{by talking to}} characters such as their client, witnesses, and the police. The player is able to move around a cursor to examine various things in the environment. By using a menu, the player can move to different locations, examine evidence, and present evidence to other characters; by showing certain pieces of evidence to some witnesses, the player can get access to new information. In the game's fifth case, created for the DS version and used in all subsequent releases, the player is able to examine evidence more closely, rotating it to view it from all sides and zooming in or out on it using touchscreen controls; they are also able to move a cursor to investigate specific parts of the evidence. The fifth case also features forensics tests that the player can use at crime scenes to find clues: the player can spray luminol by tapping areas they want to examine on the touch screen, which makes the player able to see otherwise invisible blood stains; and they can touch the touch screen to apply aluminum flake powder in order to search for finger prints. After applying it, they can blow into the microphone to reveal the prints. Once the player has gathered enough evidence, the investigation section ends.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{can hear}} {{both in the}} air and below water. They do not have {{external}} ears; the eardrums (tympanic membranes) are directly exposed or may be covered by a layer of skin and are visible as a circular area just behind the eye. The size and distance apart of the eardrums is related to the frequency and wavelength at which the frog calls. In some species such as the bullfrog, the size of the tympanum indicates the sex of the frog; males have tympani that are larger than their eyes while in females, the eyes and tympani are much the same size. A noise causes the tympanum to vibrate and the sound is transmitted to the middle and inner ear. The middle ear contains semicircular canals which help control balance and orientation. In the inner ear, the auditory hair cells are arranged in two areas of the cochlea, the basilar papilla and the amphibian papilla. The former detects high frequencies and the latter low frequencies. Because the cochlea is short, frogs use electrical tuning to extend their range of audible frequencies and help discriminate different sounds. This arrangement enables detection of the territorial and breeding calls of their conspecifics. In some species that inhabit arid regions, the sound of thunder or heavy rain may arouse them from a dormant state. A frog may be startled by an unexpected noise but it will not <b>usually</b> <b>take</b> any action until it has located the source of the sound by sight.|$|E

5|$|Owing to its size, gregariousness and its {{defensive}} abilities, {{the common}} raven has few natural predators. Predators of its eggs include owls, martens, and sometimes eagles. Ravens are quite vigorous at defending their young {{and are usually}} successful at driving off perceived threats. They attack potential predators by flying at them and lunging with their large bills. Humans are occasionally attacked if they get close to a raven nest, though serious injuries are unlikely. There are a few records of predation by large birds of prey. Their attackers in America have reportedly included great horned owls, northern goshawks, bald eagles, golden eagles and red-tailed hawks, {{it is possible that}} the two hawks only have attacked young ravens, as had a peregrine falcon who in one instance swooped at a newly fledged raven but was successfully chased off by the parent ravens. In Eurasia, their reported predators include, in addition to golden eagles, Eurasian eagle-owls, white-tailed eagles, Steller's sea-eagles, eastern imperial eagles and gyrfalcons. Because they are potentially hazardous prey for raptorial birds, raptors must <b>usually</b> <b>take</b> them by surprise and most attacks are on fledgling ravens. More rarely still, large mammalian predators such as lynxes, coyotes and cougars have also attacked ravens. This principally occurs at a nest site and when other prey for the carnivores are scarce. Ravens are highly wary around novel carrion sites and, in North America, have been recorded waiting for the presence of American crows and blue jays before approaching to eat.|$|E
5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2016 season, two ninety-minute practice and one sixty-minute session were held before qualifying on Saturday. The first two <b>usually</b> <b>take</b> place on Friday, with Monaco being the single exemption, where those sessions are held on Thursday, {{in order to}} minimise road-closure disruptions to local residents. In the first session on Thursday morning, Lewis Hamilton topped the timesheets {{with a time of}} 1:15.537, one tenth of a second faster than his teammate Nico Rosberg. They were followed by Sebastian Vettel, almost half a second down on Hamilton, and the two Red Bull cars of Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen respectively. Daniil Kvyat, driving for Toro Rosso, in sixth was the last driver to get within a second of Hamilton's time. He {{was the only one of}} the front runners to set his time on the supersoft instead of the faster ultrasoft tyres. There were several incidents during the session: After twenty-four minutes, Felipe Massa hit the barrier in turn one, damaging his car and leading to a virtual safety car (VSC) period. Later, Lewis Hamilton had a brake lockup at the same spot, but was able to get into the run-off area without touching the guardrail. Several other drivers had dangerous moments in turn one as well, but the most severe incident of the session came three minutes to the end: A drain cover had come loose around the first corner, puncturing Rosberg's left rear tyre and damaging Jenson Button's McLaren MP4-31, causing the practice to be red flagged, ultimately ending the session.|$|E
5|$|The {{debate among}} monks unfolds in the {{presence}} of their teachers, with a very well set rules of procedure for the defender and the questioners. The tradition of such debates is traced to the ancient ‘Hindu Orthodoxy’ in India and this practice permeated into Buddhist orthodoxy in Tibet in the eighth century. Such debates <b>usually</b> <b>take</b> place within the monastery’s precincts. The defender has the onus to prove his point of view on the subject proposed for debate. The debate opens with an invocation to Manjushri recited in a loud and high pitched tone. The roles of the debater and the questioner are well defined; the questioner has to succinctly present his case (all on Buddhism related topics) and the defender has to answer within a fixed time frame. The finality of the debate is with specific answers like: “I accept (do), the reason is not established (ta madrup) or there is no pervasion (Kyappa majung)”. Many a time, the questions mooted are meant to mislead the defender. If the defender does not reply within a time frame, an expression of derision is witnessed. In the Tibetan debating sessions, there is no role for a witness and there is normally no adjudicator. This leads to “conflicting opinions of participants and listeners.” When there is direct contradiction on the defenders part, the outcome is, however, formally decided.|$|E
