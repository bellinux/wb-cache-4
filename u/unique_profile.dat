25|$|There is {{not much}} vintage {{variation}} due to the reliability of favorable weather with little risk of summer time frost or harvest time rains. The main exception, again, is Casablanca {{due in part to}} its proximity to the Pacific. For the Chilean wine regions in the Valle Central, the Andes and Coastal Ranges create a rain shadow effect which traps the warm arid air in the region. At night, cool air comes into the area from the Andes which dramatically drops the temperature. This help maintain high levels of acidity to go with the ripe fruit that grapes develop with the long hours of uninterrupted sunshine that they get during the day. The result is a <b>unique</b> <b>profile</b> of flavonoids in the wine which some Chilean wineries claim make Chilean wines higher in resveratrol and antioxidants. Harvest typically begins at the end of February for varieties like Chardonnay with some red wine varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon being picked in April and Carmenère sometimes staying on the vine into May.|$|E

40|$|The {{morphological}} {{traits that}} are traditionally {{used to identify}} potato cultivars are not always reliable, especially when dealing with in vitro plants. Various molecular marker techniques have been described for cultivar identification, but the Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) technique has certain qualities that render it highly suitable for this application. In this study five SSR primer sets were used to characterize twenty-four commercially important potato cultivars. All profiles {{were found to be}} reliable and no variation was found between clones of the same cultivar. The number of polymorphisms detected with each of the markers varied, but none of the primers yielded only monomorphic fragments. The multilocus primer, STIIKA produced <b>unique</b> <b>profiles</b> for each of the 24 primer sets. However, the complicated nature of the profiles limits its use for routine diagnostic purposes. The use of the markers STS and STU 69633 in combination yields <b>unique</b> <b>profiles</b> for 20 cultivars {{and the fact that they}} can be analysed simultaneously on one gel, saves time and costs. The present study thus confirms that SSRs can be employed in a routine profiling system to provide highly discriminative and standardized profiles for South African potato cultivars. Articl...|$|R
