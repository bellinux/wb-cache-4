2500|$|Salsa was {{the fourth}} {{innovation}} based on Cuban music to hit the US, and differed {{in that it was}} initially developed in the US, not in Cuba. Because Cuba has so many indigenous types of music {{there has always been a}} problem in marketing the 'product' abroad to people who did not <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> rhythms that, to a Cuban, are quite distinct. So, twice in the 20th century, a kind of product label was developed to solve this problem. The first occasion was in the 1930s after [...] "The Peanut Vendor" [...] became an international success. It was called a 'rumba' even though it really had nothing to do with genuine rumba: the number was obviously a son pregon. The label 'rumba' was used outside Cuba for years as a catch-all for Cuban popular music.|$|E
2500|$|The {{quality of}} {{information}} that is recalled can vary greatly depending on the information being remembered. It is important to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> remembering something and knowing something. If information about the learning context accompanies a memory (i.e. the setting), it is called a [...] "remember" [...] experience. However, if a person does not consciously remember {{the context in which}} he or she learned a particular piece of information and only has the feeling of familiarity towards it, it is called a [...] "know" [...] experience. It is widely believed that recognition has two underlying processes: recollection and familiarity. The recollection process retrieves memories from one's past and can elicit any number of associations of the prior experience ("remember"). In contrast, the familiarity process does not elicit associations with the memory and there are no contextual details of the prior learning occurrence ("know"). Since these two processes are dissociable, they can be affected by different variables (i.e. when remember is affected know is not and vice versa). For example, [...] "remember" [...] is affected by variables such as depth of processing, generation effects, the frequency of occurrence, divided attention at learning, and reading silently vs. aloud. In contrast, [...] "know" [...] is affected by repetition priming, stimulus modality, amount of maintenance rehearsal, and suppression of focal attention. There are cases however, where [...] "remember" [...] and [...] "know" [...] are both affected, but in opposite ways. An example of this would be if [...] "remember" [...] responses are more common than [...] "know" [...] responses. This can occur due to word versus nonword memory, massed versus distributed practice, gradual versus abrupt presentations, and learning in a way that emphasizes similarities vs. differences.|$|E

6000|$|Now was {{the time}} at which Mr. Gladstone's {{relations}} with Manning and Hope began to approach their closest. Newman, the great enchanter, in obedience to his bishop had dropped {{the issue of the}} Tracts; had withdrawn from all public discussion of ecclesiastical politics; had given up his work in Oxford; and had retired with a neophyte or two to Littlemore, a hamlet {{on the outskirts of the}} ever venerable city, there to pursue his theological studies, to prepare translations of Athanasius, to attend to his little parish, and generally to go about his own business so far as he might be permitted by the restlessness alike of unprovoked opponents and unsought disciples. This was the autumn of 1843. In October Manning sent to Mr. Gladstone two letters that he had received from Newman, indicating only too plainly, as they were both convinced, that the foundations of their leader's anglicanism had been totally undermined by the sweeping repudiation alike by episcopal and university authority of the doctrines of Tract Ninety. Dr. Pusey, on the other hand, admitted that the expressions in Newman's letter were portentous, but did not believe that they necessarily meant secession. In a man of the world this would not have been regarded as candid. For Newman says, 'I formally told Pusey that I expected to leave the church of England in the autumn of 1843, and begged him to tell others, that no one might be taken by surprise or might trust me in the interval.'[186] But Newman has told us that he had from the first great difficulty in making Dr. Pusey <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> them. The letters stand in the Apologia (chapter iv. § 2) to tell their own tale. To Mr. Gladstone their shock was extreme, not only by reason of the catastrophe to which they pointed, but from the ill-omened shadow that they threw upon the writer's probity of mind if not of heart. 'I stagger to and fro like a drunken man,' he wrote to Manning, 'I am at my wit's end.' He found some of Newman's language, 'forgive me if I say it, more like the expressions of some Faust gambling for his soul, than the records of the inner life of a great Christian teacher.' In his diary, he puts it thus:-- ...|$|E
