5|$|Both NAD and NADH {{strongly}} absorb {{ultraviolet light}} {{because of the}} adenine. For example, peak absorption of NAD is at a wavelength of 259nanometers (nm), with an extinction coefficient of 16,900M−1cm−1. NADH also absorbs at higher wavelengths, with a second peak in UV absorption at 339nm with an extinction coefficient of 6,220M−1cm−1.

40|$|Solar {{radiation}} causes immunosuppression {{that contributes}} to skin cancer growth. Photoprotective strategies initially focused on the more erythemogenic ultraviolet B. More recently, the relationship of ultraviolet A and skin cancer has received increased attention. We hypothesized that if ultraviolet A contributes significantly to human ultraviolet-induced immune suppression, then increased ultraviolet A filtration by a sunscreen would better protect the immune system during ultraviolet exposure. Two hundred and eleven volunteers were randomized into study groups and received solar-simulated radiation, ranging from 0 to 2 minimum erythema dose, on gluteal skin, with or without sunscreen, 48 h prior to sensitization with dinitrochlorobenzene. Contact hypersensitivity response was evaluated by measuring the increase in skin fold thickness of five graded dinitrochlorobenzene challenge sites on the arm, 2 wk after sensitization. Clinical scoring using the North American Contact Dermatitis Group method was also performed. Solar-simulated radiation dose–response curves were generated and immune protection factor was calculated using a nonlinear regression model. Significance of immune protection between study groups was determined with the Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon exact test. The sunscreen with high <b>ultraviolet</b> A <b>absorption</b> (<b>ultraviolet</b> A protection factor of 10, based on the in vivo persistent pigment darkening method) and a labeled sun protection factor of 15 demonstrated better immune protection than the product that had a low <b>ultraviolet</b> A <b>absorption</b> (<b>ultraviolet</b> A protection factor of 2) and a labeled sun protection factor of 15. Nonlinear regression analysis based on skin fold thickness increase revealed that the high ultraviolet A protection factor sunscreen had an immune protection factor of 50, {{more than three times}} its sun protection factor, whereas the low ultraviolet A protection factor sunscreen had an immune protection factor of 15, which was equal to its labeled sun protection factor. This study demonstrates that ultraviolet A contributes greatly to human immune suppression and that a broad-spectrum sunscreen with high ultraviolet A filtering capacity results in immune protection that exceeds erythema protection. These results show that high ultraviolet A protection is required to protect against ultraviolet-induced damage to cutaneous immunity...|$|R

50|$|Intact {{beta-lactam}} antibiotics act as {{an analog}} to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) involved in peptidoglycan synthesis. Beta-lactamases hydrolyze the amide bond between the carbonyl carbon and the nitrogen in the beta-lactam ring of susceptible beta-lactams and members of beta-lactam subclasses (including certain cephalosporins). After hydrolysis of the amide bond, the antibiotic lacks the ability to mimic bacterial PBPs and is rendered useless. Visual detection {{of this process is}} essentially impossible with most cephalosporins because the shift of <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>absorption</b> from the intact versus hydrolyzed product occurs outside of the visible spectrum. Hydrolysis of nitrocefin however, produces a shift of <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>absorption</b> inside the visible light spectrum from intact (yellow) nitrocefin (~380 nm) to degraded (red) nitrocefin (~500 nm) allowing visual detection of beta-lactamase activity on a macroscopic level.|$|E

40|$|We report {{laboratory}} {{measurements of}} the absorption coefficient of solid para-H 2, within the wavelength range from 1 to 16. 7 micron, at high spectral resolution. In addition to the narrow rovibrational lines of H 2 which are familiar from gas phase spectroscopy, the data manifest double transitions and broad phonon branches that are characteristic specifically of hydrogen in the solid phase. These transitions are of interest because they provide a spectral signature which is independent of the impurity content of the matrix.

Our results will be useful in determining the electromagnetic response of small particles of solid hydrogen.
