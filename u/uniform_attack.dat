50|$|Pitting Corrosion {{is defined}} by {{localised}} attack (microns - millimetres in diameter) in an otherwise passive surface and only occurs for specific alloy / environment combinations. Thus, this type of corrosion typically occurs in alloys that are protected by a tenacious (passivating) oxide film such as stainless steels, nickel alloys, aluminium alloys in environments that contain an aggressive species such as chlorides (Cl-). In contrast, alloy / environment combinations where the passive film is not very protective usually will not produce pitting corrosion. A {{good example of the}} importance of environment / alloy combinations is carbon steel. In environments where the pH is less than 10, carbon steel does not form a passivating oxide film and the addition of chloride results in <b>uniform</b> <b>attack</b> over the entire surface. However, at pH greater than 10 (alkaline) the oxide is very protecting and the addition of chloride results in pitting corrosion.|$|E

40|$|The present work {{deals with}} pitting {{corrosion}} of p- and n-type GaAs (100). Pit growth can be electrochemically initiated on both conduction types in chloride-containing solutions and leads after {{extended periods of}} time to the formation of a porous GaAs structure. In the case of p-type material, localized corrosion is only observed if a passivating film is present on the surface, otherwise [...] e. g. in acidic solutions [...] the material suffers from a <b>uniform</b> <b>attack</b> (electropolishing) which is independent of the anion present. In contrast, pitting corrosion of n-type material can be triggered independent of the presence of an oxide film.

40|$|We {{introduce}} two {{tactics to}} attack agents trained by deep reinforcement learning algorithms using adversarial examples, namely the strategically-timed attack and the enchanting attack. In the strategically-timed attack, the adversary aims at minimizing the agent's reward by only attacking the agent {{at a small}} subset of time steps in an episode. Limiting the attack activity to this subset helps prevent detection of the attack by the agent. We propose a novel method to determine when an adversarial example should be crafted and applied. In the enchanting attack, the adversary aims at luring the agent to a designated target state. This is achieved by combining a generative model and a planning algorithm: while the generative model predicts the future states, the planning algorithm generates a preferred sequence of actions for luring the agent. A sequence of adversarial examples is then crafted to lure the agent to take the preferred sequence of actions. We apply the two tactics to the agents trained by the state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithm including DQN and A 3 C. In 5 Atari games, our strategically timed attack reduces as much reward as the <b>uniform</b> <b>attack</b> (i. e., attacking at every time step) does by attacking the agent 4 times less often. Our enchanting attack lures the agent toward designated target states with a more than 70 % success rate. Videos are available at [URL] To Appear at IJCAI 2017. Project website: [URL]...|$|E
40|$|This article re-examines {{one aspect}} of the celebrated {{parliamentary}} reform programme of 1641 - 2 which was designed to address Charles I's abuse of his prerogative powers during the Personal Rule. It focuses on the opposition to the Council in the Marches of Wales and revises the traditional picture of an undifferentiated and <b>uniform</b> <b>attack</b> on prerogative government by the Commons. Rather, this essay uncovers a more complex mixture of sectional interest groups coming together to oppose the Council. It reveals how long-standing local grievances in the border shires of western England were swept up and radicalised by common lawyersâ€™ opposition to non-common law jurisdictions. An important context for the assault on the Marcher Council was the prevailing anxiety over tyranny and arbitrary government, something which had been given a sharper edge by the trial of the earl of Strafford, lord president of the Council's sister body in northern England. The article also employs new material to discuss those who struggled to defend the Council, and who marshalled creative legal arguments in an effort to salvage it from the wreckage of the king's prerogative instruments. A powerful coalition brought the Marcher Council to its knees by mid- 1642, although it was never formally abolished. The article also utilises a previously unknown draft bill for removing the Council in the Marches, and reveals parliament's plans for undertaking the most sweeping transformation of the legal landscape in Wales and western England since the Acts of Union a century before...|$|E
40|$|The {{passivity}} of 98. 5 % pure beryllium (Be) {{has been}} studied {{as a function of}} pH. Below pH 2, Be exhibited active dissolution at all applied anodic potentials In solution pH 2 - 12. 5 it is shown that Be exhibited passive anodic behavior at potentials between the open circuit potential and 0. 6 V vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE) [...] Anodic polarization above 0. 6 V SCE in the pH range of 2 - 12. 5 lead to an abrupt increase in the passive current density followed by oxygen evolution. This abrupt increase was attributed to a change in the specific resistivity of the passive film above 0. 6 V SCE as determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). EIS experiments were also used to show that the oxide growth rate on Be was 6. 4 Ã…/V over the potential range of 0 - 4 V. At higher anodization potentials the growth rate appeared to be somewhat lower. Br akdown of passivity was studied in chloride and fluoride solutions. In chloride, attack was found to be localized while in fluoride, attack was localized only at concentrations below 10 - 3 M. Above fluoride concentrations of 10 - 3 M, <b>uniform</b> <b>attack</b> was observed.
