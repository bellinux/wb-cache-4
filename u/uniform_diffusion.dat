The <b>uniform</b> <b>diffusion</b> time and the effective concentration of the aerosol {{fire extinguishing}} agent are important parameters for putting out a fire. In this work, the effective concentration is derived based on the diffusion equation, and its variation with changing diffusion coefficient and diffusion time is analyzed.

40|$|Most {{theoretical}} models {{used to describe}} the potentiostatic transient for the case of multiple nucleation on active sites with diffusion-controlled growth are based on the concept of planar diffusion. It is shown that the definition of a planar diffusion zone is based on an analogy with the Cottrell equation but does not involve a flux balance, as is usually stated in the literature. The current to a growing nucleus can be written in a form that presents this analogy but it remains a hemispherical current, i. e. there is no change in the diffusional regime or the associated boundary conditions. This is the key feature of the concept of planar diffusion zones because it provides a simple way to describe the transition of hemispherical diffusion to planar diffusion when the diffusion fields interfere. In essence, a model based on the concept of planar diffusion zones can only work just because it is not based on a flux balance. The concept of a planar diffusion zone usually is associated with the growth of a single nucleus but this notion is not really needed to derive (lie equation of the potentiostatic transient. It is better to apply this concept to the ensemble of growing nuclei as a whole since (his leads in a natural way to the definition of a <b>uniform</b> <b>diffusion</b> layer, which is connected {{with the idea of a}} mean concentration field. It is this notion of a <b>uniform</b> <b>diffusion</b> layer that reduces the interference of hemispherical diffusion fields to a true two-dimensional problem so that Avrami's equation can be used correctly to describe the overlap of the planar diffusion zones.

40|$|International audienceRecent {{studies have}} {{revealed}} the structural and functional interactions between mitochondria, myofibrils and sarcoplasmic reticulum in cardiac cells. Direct channeling of adenosine phosphates between organelles {{identified in the}} experiments indicates that diffusion of adenosine phosphates is limited in cardiac cells due to very specific intracellular structural organization. However, the mode of diffusion restrictions {{and nature of the}} intracellular structures in creating the diffusion barriers is still unclear, and, therefore, a subject of active research. The aim of this work is to analyze the possible role of two principally different modes of restriction distribution for adenosine phosphates (a) the <b>uniform</b> <b>diffusion</b> restriction and (b) the localized diffusion limitation in the vicinity of mitochondria, by fitting the experimental data with the mathematical model. The reaction-diffusion model of compartmentalized energy transfer was used to analyze the data obtained from the experiments with the skinned muscle fibers, which described the following processes: mitochondrial respiration rate dependency on exogenous ADP and ATP concentrations; inhibition of endogenous ADP-stimulated respiration by pyruvate kinase (PK) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) system; kinetics of oxygen consumption stabilization after addition of 2 mM MgATP or MgADP; ATPase activity with inhibited mitochondrial respiration; and buildup of MgADP concentration in the medium after addition of MgATP. The analysis revealed that only the second mechanism considered [...] localization of diffusion restrictions [...] is able to account for the experimental data. In the case of <b>uniform</b> <b>diffusion</b> restrictions, the model solution was in agreement only with two measurements: the respiration rate as a function of ADP or ATP concentrations and inhibition of respiration by PK + PEP. It was concluded that intracellular diffusion restrictions for adenosine phosphates are not distributed uniformly, but rather are localized in certain compartments of the cardiac cells...|$|E

We {{address the problem}} of estimating parameters (diffusion probability and time-delay parameter) of the probabilistic model {{as a function of the}} node attributes from the observed diffusion data by formulating it as the maximum likelihood problem. We show that the parameters are obtained by an iterative updating algorithm which is efficient and is guaranteed to converge. We tested the performance of the learning algorithm on three real world networks assuming the attribute dependency, and confirmed that the dependency can be correctly learned.

40|$|We {{model the}} {{transport}} of cosmic ray nuclei in the Galaxy {{by means of a}} new numerical code.

Convection and re-acceleration do not seem to be required in the energy range we consider: 1 < E < 10 ^ 3 / nucleon. We generalize these results accounting for radial dependence of the diffusion coefficient, which is assumed to trace that of the cosmic ray sources. While this does not affect the prediction of secondary/primary ratios, the simulated longitude profile of the diffuse γ-ray emission is significantly different from the uniform case and may agree with EGRET measurements without invoking ad hoc assumptions on the galactic gas density distribution...|$|E

40|$|Advancement of {{large-scale}} integrated interconnect structure requires an ultra-thin and <b>uniform</b> <b>diffusion</b> barrier layer between Cu interconnect and insulating layers. As a promising alternative {{barrier to the}} conventional Ta/TaN, the self-forming barrier layer from the CuMnTi alloy layer was investigated in this work. In order to achieve the self-forming barrier layer, the CuMnTi alloy layer first was deposited on SiO 2 substrate by magnetron sputtering. Second, the alloying elements were driven and migrated to the interface, and moreover, reacted with SiO 2 to form the self-forming barrier layer. The self-forming barrier layer has a thickness of about 5 nm. The annealing leads to an obvious decrease of resistivity from 50. 10 mu Omega cm to 4. 23 mu Omega cm for the CuMnTi alloy layer. The self-forming barrier can improve the adhesion of Cu interconnect layer and effectively prevent element diffusion between Cu interconnect and insulating SiO 2 substrate. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

In this lecture, we point out that there is certain advantage in studying discrete arrays, namely cellular neural/nonlinear networks (CNNs), over continuous systems. Then, to illustrate these ideas, the dynamics of diffusively coupled one and two dimensional cellular nonlinear networks (CNNs), involving Murali-Lakshmanan-Chua circuit as the basic element, is considered. Propagation failure in the case of <b>uniform</b> <b>diffusion</b> and propagation blocking in the case of defects are pointed out. The mechanism behind these phenomena in terms of loss of stability is explained. Various spatiotemporal patterns arising from diffusion driven instability such as hexagons, rhombous and rolls are considered when external forces are absent. Existence of penta-hepta defects and removal of them due to external forcing is discussed. The transition from hexagonal to roll structure and breathing oscillations in the presence of external forcing is also demonstrated.

40|$|Recent results {{obtained}} by analyzing diffuse gamma-ray emission detected by Fermi-LAT show a substantial {{variation of the}} CR spectrum {{as a function of}} the distance from the Galactic Center. For energies up to tens of GeV, the CR proton density in the outer Galaxy appears to be weakly dependent upon the galactocentric distance while the density in the central region of the Galaxy was found to exceed the value measured in the outer Galaxy. At the same time, Fermi-LAT data suggest a gradual spectral softening while moving outward from the center of the Galaxy to its outskirts. These findings represent a challenge for standard calculations of CR propagation based on assuming a <b>uniform</b> <b>diffusion</b> coefficient within the Galactic volume. Here we present a model of non-linear CR propagation in which transport is due to particle scattering and advection off self-generated turbulence. We will show that for a realistic distribution of CR sources following the spatial distribution of supernova remnants and the space dependence of the magnetic field on galactocentric distance, both the spatial profile of CR density and the spectral softening can easily be accounted for.
