50|$|May Yukishiro {{is one of}} the heroines in the story, and {{the first}} to be met by Kaito. She is a sweet, kind and {{sometimes}} a rather clumsy girl, but tends to be slow at times, this is due to her innocent and caring nature. In the beginning May is willing to help Kaito as much as she can, since she is always kind and helpful, especially to uncivilized people. She is oblivious to many things making her a naive person. May is very calm and reserved most of the time. Taking care of flowers seems to be one of her hobbies, as she is first seen by Kaito looking after lilies blooming on a hill. Her route in the game focuses on <b>unraveling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> about Kaito. She is affiliated with The United Provinces of Japan and her related arcana is The Empress.|$|E
50|$|Through Municipal clerk Ganpat, Jai stumbles {{upon the}} secret that pop star Sarena {{is not the}} real {{daughter}} of industrialist Vivek Devan, who had taken great pains {{to ensure that no}} one knew she was adopted. Jai realizes that this could be the story he was looking for and goes ahead and publishes it, thus incurring the wrath of Vivek Devan. Even the tabloid owner Dada (Rajpal Yadav) is upset with Jai and disapproves his idea of <b>unraveling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> An enraged Vivek Devan takes legal action against the tabloid by sending defamation notice for Rupees five crores and he also tries to suppress any further information being leaked. Sarena, however, notices her father's anxiety and confronts him, only to discover that Jai, despite his crude ways of going about it, had written the truth. Ignoring her father's protests, Sarena goes in search of her real mother. At every stage, her companion in her mission is Jai, who follows her through the journey from Mumbai to Ooty to get the legal notice withdrawn.|$|E
