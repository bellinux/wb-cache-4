Booker-McConnell paid her approximately £85,000 for the rights to the 17 Heyer titles owned by the company. This amount was taxed at the lower capital transfer rate, rather than the higher income tax rate.|$|E

After the impact of these deaths, her friends Michael Stipe of R.E.M. and Allen Ginsberg (whom she had known since her early years in New York) <b>urged</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> go back out on the road. She toured briefly with Bob Dylan in December 1995 (chronicled in a book of {{photographs}} by Stipe).|$|E

5|$|Fonda {{argued that}} the {{military}} campaign in Iraq will turn {{people all over the}} world against America, and asserted that a global hatred of America would result in more terrorist attacks in the aftermath of the war. In July 2005, Fonda announced plans to make an anti-war bus tour in March 2006 with her daughter and several families of military veterans, saying that some war veterans she had met while on her book tour had <b>urged</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> speak out against the Iraq War. She later canceled the tour due to concerns that she would divert attention from Cindy Sheehan's activism.|$|E
5|$|Though the Queen Regent, Mary of Guise, made no {{move against}} Knox, his {{activities}} caused concern among the church authorities. The bishops of Scotland viewed him {{as a threat to}} their authority and summoned him to appear in Edinburgh on 15 May 1556. He was accompanied to the trial by so many influential persons that the bishops decided to call the hearing off. Knox was now free to preach openly in Edinburgh. William Keith, the Earl Marischal, was impressed and urged Knox to write to the Queen Regent. Knox's unusually respectful letter <b>urged</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> support the Reformation and overthrow the church hierarchy. Queen Mary took the letter as a joke and ignored it.|$|E
5|$|Returning to California, Solis became Director of the California Student Opportunity and Access Program in 1982, to help {{disadvantaged}} youth gain necessary {{preparation for}} college. In particular, {{she worked with}} the Whittier Union High School District. Friends <b>urged</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> try for elective office, and so in 1985, she ran for the Board of Trustees of the Rio Hondo Community College District. She campaigned hard and overtook an incumbent and one other better established candidate to become the top placer. She was reelected in 1989. During her time on the board, she worked towards improved vocational job training at the college and sought {{to increase the number}} of tenured faculty positions held by minorities and women. She joined several California chambers of commerce, women's organizations, and Latino organizations. She gained added political visibility in 1991 when she was named to the Los Angeles County Commission on Insurance by Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina, a political mentor. Solis also served as chief of staff for State Senator Art Torres.|$|E

5|$|The Queen had {{to mediate}} between her {{brothers}} in 1555, when Charles decided to abdicate as emperor {{and leave the}} government of the Netherlands to his son Philip, despite Ferdinand's objections. When Mary learned of Charles's decision, she informed him that she too would resign. Both Charles and Philip <b>urged</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> remain in the post, but she refused. She chronicled the difficulties she had faced due to her gender, the fact that she could not act as she thought she should have because of disagreements with Charles, and her age. Furthermore, she did not wish to accommodate to the ways of her nephew after years of getting used to Charles's demands. The actual reason for Mary's resignation was her numerous disagreements with her nephew. She asked for Charles's permission to leave the Netherlands upon her resignation, fearing that she would be drawn into politics again if she remained.|$|E

Harriet Martineau and others dismissed Wollstonecraft's contributions as dangerous, and deplored Norton's candidness, but seized on the abolitionist campaign that Martineau had witnessed in the United States as one that should logically be applied to women. Her Society in America was pivotal: it caught the imagination of women who <b>urged</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> take up their cause.|$|E
25|$|Black {{leaders such}} as Rev. Joseph Lowery, Dr. Francys Johnson, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and the Congressional Black Caucus have criticized Baker's appeal of the Monroe County ruling.

25|$|After {{completing}} college, VanDerveer {{took a year}} off, with a plan {{to return}} to law school. When she ran out of money she returned home.

Her sister was five years younger, and by the time Marie reached high school, the school had basketball teams for girls. The experience was exasperating in some ways, as the girls did not take it seriously, but VanDerveer realized coaching was something she loved.|$|E

25|$|In a 2015 BBC News article, {{reporter}} Jonah Fisher {{suggested that}} Aung San Suu Kyi’s silence over the Rohingya issue {{is due to}} a need to obtain support from the majority Bamar ethnicity as she is in “the middle of a general election campaign”. In May 2015, the Dalai Lama publicly called upon her to do more to help the Rohingya in Myanmar, claiming that he had previously <b>urged</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> address the plight of the Rohingya in private during two separate meetings and that she had resisted his urging. In May 2016, Suu Kyi asked the newly appointed United States Ambassador to Myanmar, Scot Marciel, not to refer to the Rohingya by that name. This followed Bamar protests at Marciel’s use of the word “Rohingya”.|$|E
25|$|In Anna's own memoirs, she {{describes}} her perils {{in prison and}} her narrow escape from execution when, miraculously, she met several old friends of her father on a St. Petersburg street who helped her escape.

Before leaving the Soviet Union, she became friends with the revolutionary writer Maxim Gorky, who <b>urged</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> write her memoirs; she followed his advice. She met with Zinaida Gippius, Alexander Blok and Valery Bryusov. Her memories of life at court provided rare descriptions of the home life of the Tsar and his family.

Her first CD release was Warpaint, in 1991. The first four albums were only available on hand-dubbed cassettes until they were re-released on CD in 1992. For the CD releases, Rhodes Vol. I was renamed Rhodes I, and Rhodes Vol. II was renamed Rhodes II. Each of the CD re-releases contained bonus tracks not on the original cassettes. Aural Gratification released nine Happy Rhodes albums between 1986 and 1995, including Equipoise and RhodeSongs in 1993, Building The Colossus in 1994 and The Keep in 1995. Rhodes left Aural Gratification in 1998.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, President Eisenhower {{nominated}} a recovered Luce {{to be the}} US Ambassador to Brazil. She {{began to}} learn enough of the Portuguese language {{in preparation for the}} job, but she was by now so conservative that her appointment met with strong opposition from a small number of Democratic senators. Leading the charge was Oregon Senator Wayne Morse. Still, Luce was confirmed by a 79 to 11 vote. Her husband <b>urged</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> decline the appointment, noting that {{it would be difficult for}} her to work with Morse, who chaired the Senate Subcommittee on Latin American Affairs. Luce eventually sent Eisenhower a letter explaining that she felt that the controversy surrounding her appointment would hinder her abilities to be respected by both her Brazilian and US coworkers and resigned from her position as ambassador. She had served only four days, from April 28 to May 1, 1959, and she had never left American soil.|$|E
