500|$|American TV series Firefly {{and film}} {{spin-off}} Serenity were cited by O'Brien as inspirations. [...] "Our other theme is you can't force {{other people to}} live by your rules and your society, even if your society is better," [...] he said. [...] "In Serenity The Operative actually says, 'This is not an evil empire. We just don't <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> don't {{want to be part}} of our happy club.' Obviously they take it too far, and that's kind of what happens in our game as well." ...|$|E
500|$|Passing sentence, Rafferty said: [...] "You robbed three {{innocent}} {{ladies of}} their lives. I suspect that their families will suffer the more as they simply don't <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> did. The brutality of these ladies' deaths, designed by you to evade discovery, showing the coldness {{with which you}} dispatched them, is appalling. You should clearly have faced up like {{a man at the}} overwhelming nature of the Crown's case against you but you chose to put the victims' families through misery which you compounded by this trial." [...] The motive for Smith's actions remained unclear after the trial, but police believed a [...] "lack of permanent sexual relations" [...] had been a contributing factor.|$|E
500|$|Leaf {{missed his}} second season due to a {{shoulder}} injury suffered 20 minutes into the Chargers' first training camp workout on July 23, 1999. Leaf had surgery to fix a labral tear in his throwing shoulder. During an August training camp, a fan heckled Leaf: [...] "Hey, Ryan, you're the worst draft choice in NFL history. You make Heath Shuler look like an All-Star." [...] Leaf, accompanied by a coach and security guards, walked towards the fan and asked a question. The fan began walking closer to Leaf, and two coaches restrained Leaf, with another Chargers employee saying [...] "No, don't do it, Ryan. Don't do it." [...] Leaf later explained the incident: [...] "...what I {{wanted to do was}} say, 'Hey, look, I've grown up, I'm calm about it, I would like to <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> would say that about me.'" ...|$|E

500|$|When {{the third}} edition was {{published}} in 1845, Balzac {{was in love with}} his own creation. He had written two years earlier to Hańska: [...] "There's no doubt about it – it is a magnificent poem. I had never really read it before.… The passion is sublime, and I now <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> have a cherished and special devotion to this book.… All in all, I am very pleased with it." [...] In a preface to the third edition, he described his plans for a part of La Comédie Humaine called Scènes de la vie militaire (Scenes from Military Life). In addition to Les Chouans with its focus on guerrilla combat, he planned another called Les Vendéans about the earlier full-scale civil war. Although in 1844 he discussed traveling to western France to write the book, it was never written.|$|E
500|$|Wilson {{was born}} in Winchester, Massachusetts on March 16, 1982. While he was in second grade, he moved to Londonderry, New Hampshire. Today, he talks little of his {{childhood}} except to discuss his father, Mike Wilson, who was an Air Force veteran and a demanding perfectionist. During fall, he would have Brian bag leaves and bury them in the woods; and in winter, he would have Brian spend seven hours shoveling snow on weekends. Brian said in a 2011 interview, [...] "I think that's how {{you need to be}} raised. It's not your friend, it's your dad. And he's going to be strict. And one day you're going to understand why. And sometimes, it's a little too late. They might pass away, and you might not get that chance to say thanks or <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> did those things. But when you become a man, you understand why." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the context}} of theistic belief, Stephen Roberts said [...] "I contend we are both atheists, I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> dismiss all the other {{possible}} gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours." ...|$|E
5000|$|It was {{reported}} in August 2009 that Hannan had praised the Conservative politician Enoch Powell as [...] "somebody who understood the importance of national democracy, who <b>understood</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> need {{to live in an}} independent country and what that meant, as well as being a free marketeer and a small-government Conservative." ...|$|R

2500|$|The [...] "historical induction" [...] {{argument}} {{concludes that}} since most theistic religions throughout history (e.g. ancient Egyptian religion, ancient Greek religion) and their gods ultimately {{come to be}} regarded as untrue or incorrect, all theistic religions, including contemporary ones, are therefore most likely untrue/incorrect by induction. It is implied as part of Stephen F. Roberts' popular quotation: I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours.|$|E

It was my joy that you must owe your happiness to me--that I would be the one to give you back Allie Lee and hope, and the old, ambitious life. Oh, I gloried in my power. It was sweet.
