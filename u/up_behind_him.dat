In the queen's bedchamber, Hamlet and Gertrude fight bitterly. Polonius, spying on the conversation from behind a tapestry, makes a noise.|$|E

For a moment the outlook was bright, for the Derbyshire men with Gell were far away at Worcester with Leven, the Yorkshire Parliamentarians engaged in besieging Scarborough and Pontefract castles and other posts. But two days later he heard that David Leslie with the cavalry of Leven's army was coming <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> and that, the Yorkshire sieges being now ended, Major-General Poyntz's force lay in his front.

25|$|During filming, it was {{considered}} that the customized 1975 Captain Kirk mask be reused for this film. However, the mask was long gone and a new one was purchased from a local costume shop. The producers wanted to test {{and see what it}} would look like without the edits. The school scene was filmed and when reviewing the producers did not like how the mask turned out. It was allegedly customized again but did not live up to the original, and the producers felt it was too old and went for a new mask. Some scenes had to be re-shot with the new mask. The only scene left in is when Loomis is thrown through a glass door; as Michael comes <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> the unaltered face and blonde hair is visible.|$|E

The heavier cannons were left behind with the 8th Brigade at Château-Thierry. Fearing the appearance of MacDonald's forces in his right rear, Yorck also sent his remaining infantry brigade back to hold Château-Thierry. The Prussian reserve cavalry deployed near Fontenelle though it lacked its artillery. Pirch deployed his brigade in two lines between Fontenelle and the hamlet of Tourneux farther east. After waiting for Horn's brigade to close <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> Pirch began attacking toward the Bailly and Plenois woods. Sacken ordered his two reserve heavy batteries to support the Prussian advance. At the same time, Michel's Old Guard division reached the battlefield and was committed to the fight against Yorck.|$|E
25|$|The first Battle Royal, on January 22, {{included}} El Terrible, El Hijo del Fantasma, Averno, Dragón Rojo Jr., Euforia, Máscara Dorada, Máximo and Misterioso II. The match {{ended with}} El Terrible and El Hijo del Fantasma {{as the last}} two wrestlers in the ring, which meant their teams would meet in the final first round match that evening. After the match order was determined the actual tournament began. The first match saw Atlantis and Máscara Dorada defeat Dragón Rojo Jr. and La Sombra. While Atlantis is a Rudo the team got along without any problems, Atlantis wore his old Tecnico style white mask and wrestled a more tecnico style to complement Máscara Dorada. The second match saw Máximo and Mr. Niebla form a team that quickly earned the nickname La Peste con Amour ("the Love Plague") born from Mr. Niebla being part of La Peste Negra ("the Black Plague") and Máximo's Exótico ring character. The team won when Máximo kissed Blue Panther or Misterioso II, distracting him long enough for Mr. Niebla to sneak <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> to roll him up for the pinfall. The third first round match paired longtime rivals Místico, CMLL's top Tecnico up with Averno, one of CMLL's top Rudos together to face Euforia and Averno's regular partner Ephesto. Místico and Averno {{came out with a}} surprising show of unity as they both wore masks that melded their own masks with their partner's mask, the arch-enemies got along in the match, handily winning it. The last match saw El Terrible and Volador Jr. defeat Hijo del Fantasma and Mephisto to earn their way to the quarter finals.|$|E

Impressed by Andy's deviousness, {{the rest of the}} office does not warn Dwight, saying that Andy [...] "deserves the win". Andy pins Dwight between the car and the large bushes in the parking lot. Jim races out to check that Andy and Dwight are not seriously injured, but they snap at him to go away. The two bicker back and forth about Angela.
