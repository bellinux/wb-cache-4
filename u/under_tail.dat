2500|$|Adult {{male and}} female rufous-tailed scrub robin look alike and measure about [...] long with {{relatively}} long legs and a large rounded tail. The upper parts are a rich brownish chestnut, with the rump and upper tail-coverts rather more rufous. There is a distinct curved, creamy-white broad streak from the nostrils to behind the eye and a dark brown line through the eye. The under-eye area is whitish and the ear coverts pale brown. The eye and the beak are both brown but the lower mandible of the beak has a greyish base. The underparts are buffish white, with the chin, central belly and <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> coverts paler than the other parts. The feathers of the wing are dark brown, fringed {{on the leading edge}} with buff and on the trailing edge with pale chestnut-brown and with the secondaries tipped with white. The central pair of feathers on the tail are bright rufous-chestnut with narrow black tips and the rest a similar colour with white tips and adjacent broad black bands. The legs and feet are pale brown. Juveniles are similar in appearance but generally a paler sandy-brown colour. The plumage is moulted in the autumn and prior to this, the white tips of the tail feathers may have become reduced in size or worn off.|$|E

50|$|S. s. stuarti, a {{very dark}} variant of the {{northern}} rough-winged swallow, was described by Pierce Brodkorb in 1942. It is resident to the southern Mexico lowlands and south to eastern Guatemala. Like the race fulvipennis, it has a slightly buff throat. The <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> coverts also have black tips.|$|E
50|$|S. s. ridgwayi, {{described}} by Edward Nelson in 1901, is a subspecies resident {{to the northern}} Yucatán Peninsula.

50|$|The {{tambourine}} dove {{is a small}} plump pigeon, typically 22 cm in length. The male has a white face with a black spot behind the eye, white underparts and a grey crown. Its back, hind neck, wings and tail are pale grey brown, and the folded wings have large dark purple patches. The <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> is brown. The eye ring and feet are purple-red, and the bill is purple.|$|E
50|$|The mature bird has the head, neck, flanks, and rump blue grey, and {{the wings}} cinnamon, mottled with black. The breast is vinaceous, the abdomen and <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> coverts are white. The bill is black, {{the legs and}} eye rims are red. The black and white patch {{on the side of}} the neck is absent in the browner and duller {{juvenile}} bird, which also has the legs brown.|$|E
30|$|To {{explain the}} dual LM {{of the mean}} and {{volatility}} of platinum and palladium return series, we fitted ARFIMA–FIGARCH type models <b>under</b> heavy <b>tailed</b> error distributions including the Normal distribution. We used an ARFIMA model for modelling squared log returns and for volatility we used FIGARCH, FIEGARCH, FIAPARCH and HYGARCH models <b>under</b> heavy <b>tailed</b> error distributions bench marking them with the Normal distribution. Distributions considered are the Normal, Student, Generalized extreme distribution (GED), and the skewed Student distribution.|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} plumage morphs exists, {{with the primary}} {{distinction}} being between the pale morph and the dark morph. Both morphs usually have dark brown upper parts and wing coverts. Dark morph birds have predominantly dark under parts, although some light streaking is common. Pale morph birds have white under parts that are varyingly streaked with brown, sometimes heavily so. Pale individuals may also have prominently white <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> coverts and these may be diagnostic.|$|E
50|$|The {{blue-headed}} parrot, {{also known}} as the blue-headed pionus (Pionus menstruus) is a medium large parrot. It is about 27 cm long and they are mainly green with a blue head and neck, and red <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> feathers. It is a resident bird in tropical and subtropical South America and southern Central America, from Costa Rica, Venezuela and Trinidad south to Bolivia and Brazil. It is named for its medium-blue head and neck.|$|E
50|$|S. s. fulvipennis is a {{resident}} of central Mexico to Costa Rica. It was the first subspecies to be differentiated from the nominate race, serripennis, and was differentiated by Philip Sclater in 1860. It is darker above; the crown darker more so. The shafts of the <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> coverts, the feathers under the tail, covering the base, have been observed to be darker near the end. The throat of these swallows seem to be slightly buff, unlike {{most of the other}} subspecies.|$|E

50|$|Like D. p. punctatus, the Mississippi {{ringneck snake}} {{characteristically}} attains a maximum length of 44.5 cm. The head {{is black and}} the body dark gray, separated by a golden ring at the neck. The ventral side displays a yellow belly, transitioning to dark orange <b>under</b> <b>tail.</b> It can be differentiated from D. p. punctatus, with which it intergrades, by its black ventral markings that present as irregular black spots or paired black spots down the middle, rather than the a single row of black spots found in D. p. punctatus.|$|E
50|$|The Asian fairy bluebird {{measures}} 24 to 27 cm in length. The iris is crimson and eyelids pinkish; the bill, {{legs and}} claws are black, and mouth a flesh- colour. Marked sexual dimorphism is evident. The male is a shining ultramarine-blue with lilac reflections on its upper plumage, lesser wing coverts, and <b>under</b> <b>tail</b> coverts, while {{the sides of}} its head and the whole lower plumage are deep black; greater wing-coverts, quills, and tail black, {{and some of the}} coverts tipped with blue, and the middle tail-feathers glossed with blue.|$|E

5000|$|Coots have {{prominent}} frontal shields {{or other}} decoration on the forehead, with red to dark red eyes and coloured bills. Many, but not all, have {{white on the}} <b>under</b> <b>tail.</b> The featherless shield {{gave rise to the}} expression [...] "as bald as a coot," [...] which the Oxford English Dictionary cites in use as early as 1430. Like other rails, they have long, lobed toes that are well adapted to soft, uneven surfaces. Coots have strong legs and can walk and run vigorously. They tend to have short, rounded wings and are weak fliers, though northern species nevertheless can cover long distances.|$|E
25|$|Dark-morph {{birds are}} dark brown {{except for a}} light patch <b>under</b> the <b>tail.</b> There is a rufous variant that is lighter on the underparts with reddish bars. The tails of both these forms {{resemble}} those of the light morph.|$|R
