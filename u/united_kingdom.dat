40|$|The article {{discusses}} the <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom's</b> {{engagement with the}} Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW.

It concludes that successive UK Governments have been complacent about the country's record with respect to women's equality. When action has been taken to remedy sex-based discrimination, the impetus for change is more often as a result of European requirements or from the personal commitment of key individuals within Parliament than from a desire to comply with the <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom's</b> legal obligations under CEDAW...|$|R
