5000|$|In 2005, while Schlozman {{was serving}} in the Civil Rights Division, the DOJ {{filed a lawsuit against}} Missouri accusing the state of failing to make a [...] "reasonable effort" [...] to {{eliminate}} ineligible people from voter rolls and improperly removing certain voters from the voter rolls prematurely. Although the then-US Attorney for Missouri, Todd Graves, whom Schlozman later succeeded after Graves' forced resignation, claims to have refused to sign off on the lawsuit, the Complaint filed in the case was signed by both Graves and an Assistant <b>U.S.</b> Attorney <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>office,</b> in addition to Schlozman and Assistant Attorney General Wan J. Kim. [...] On April 13, 2007, a federal district judge dismissed the lawsuit, asserting that the Secretary of State couldn't police local registration rolls. The Justice Department appealed that ruling, however, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit later reversed the district court's decision. In March 2009, after a new political leadership had been installed at the Justice Department {{in the wake of the}} presidential election, the Justice Department asked a judge to dismiss the lawsuit, essentially ending the case and dropping all charges.|$|R
