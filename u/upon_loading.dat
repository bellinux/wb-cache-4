25|$|The Type 1 47mm AT gun was a {{relative}} modern design {{compared to other}} Japanese Second World war designs, being relatively light and easy to handle. As with many Japanese designs, it had a very low profile and {{was intended to be}} operated from a kneeling or prone position. The gun had a gun shield to protect the gunner. The carriage appears to have adopted a number of design features from the Soviet ZIK 45 mm anti-tank gun, a number of examples of which were captured by the Japanese during the Battle of Khalkhin Gol (Nomonhan) in 1939. It used a semi-automatic breech block with a horizontal sliding wedge. When the gun was fired the spent shell casing was automatically ejected, and <b>upon</b> <b>loading</b> a fresh shell, the breech block closed automatically. A hydrospring recoil mechanism was housed under the barrel. The weapon had a split trail which opened to an angle of 60 degrees for firing to improve stability. Transport was by towing behind a truck or horse, via two steel disc wheels fitted with sponge rubber filled tires.|$|E
25|$|High {{hydrogen}} adsorption enthalpy is also important. Theoretical {{studies have}} shown that 22-25kJ/mol interactions are ideal for hydrogen storage at room temperature, as they are strong enough to adsorb H2, but weak enough to allow for quick desorption. The interaction between hydrogen and uncharged organic linkers is not this strong, and so a considerable amount of work has gone in synthesis of MOFs with exposed metal sites, to which hydrogen adsorbs with an enthalpy of 5-10kJ/mol. Synthetically, this may be achieved by using ligands whose geometries prevent the metal from being fully coordinated, by removing volatile metal-bound solvent molecules over the course of synthesis, and by post-synthetic impregnation with additional metal cations. (C5H5)V(CO)3(H2) and Mo(CO)5(H2) are great examples of increased binding energy due to open metal coordination sites; however, their high metal-hydrogen bond dissociation energies result in a tremendous release of heat <b>upon</b> <b>loading</b> with hydrogen, which is not favorable for fuel cells. MOFs, therefore, should avoid orbital interactions that lead to such strong metal-hydrogen bonds and employ simple charge-induced dipole interactions, as demonstrated in Mn32.|$|E

The cushions should be placed away {{from the corners of}} the workpiece, so that workpiece damping is minimized, which promotes increased resonant response to vibration.|$|R
50|$|Many {{character}} encoding systems, including UTF-8, are supported. GNU Emacs uses UTF-8 for its encoding as of GNU 23, while prior versions {{used their}} own encoding internally and performed conversion <b>upon</b> <b>load</b> and save. The internal encoding used by XEmacs {{is similar to}} that of GNU Emacs but differs in details.|$|R
25|$|Little-used {{floppy disk}} drives sitting unused {{for years in}} {{computers}} can actually damage disks, due to computer case air cooling that sucks air through the drive openings. This pulls dust into the mechanism, which coats all surfaces including the exposed read/write head. <b>Upon</b> <b>loading</b> a disk on the rare occasion the drive is needed, the dust is stirred up when the disk is inserted into the mechanism, and the dust on the head is ground into the medium while the stirred-up dust is deposited onto the disk through the open shutters, leading to nearly instant fouling of the media. The dust also gets into the drive mechanism lubricant, {{turning it into a}} sticky slime, which may jam the mechanism and prevent head movement. This causes the computer user to see read errors on every disk they try to use, and it may also lead to data corruption through writing in incorrect locations. Some users incorrectly assume that this means all their disks have gone bad, when it is in fact the drive that is the problem. The solution is for a technician to clean the drive before it is used after a long idle period.|$|E
2500|$|JavaScript {{processes}} {{messages from}} a queue {{one at a}} time. <b>Upon</b> <b>loading</b> a new message, JavaScript calls a function associated with that message, which creates a call stack frame (the function's arguments and local variables). The call stack shrinks and grows based on the function's needs. Upon function completion, when the stack is empty, JavaScript proceeds to the next message in the queue. This is called the event loop, described as [...] "run to completion" [...] because each message is fully processed before the next message is considered. However, the language's concurrency model describes the event loop as non-blocking: program input/output is performed using events and callback functions. This means, for instance, that JavaScript can process a mouse click while waiting for a database query to return information.|$|E
2500|$|In 1938 the Mark VIII (Mark VIII and Mark VIIIz) round was {{approved}} to obtain greater {{range from the}} Vickers machine gun.

The Mark VIII cartridge had a maximum range of approximately [...] Mk VIII ammunition was described as being for [...] "All suitably-sighted [...]303-inch small arms and machine guns" [...] but caused significant bore erosion in weapons formerly using Mk VII cordite, ascribed to the channelling effect of the boat-tail projectile. As a result, it was prohibited from general use with rifles and light machine guns except in emergency. [...] As a consequence of the official prohibition, ordnance personnel reported that every man that could get his hands on Mk VIII ammunition promptly used it in his own rifle.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{indicate}} what effect the distortion of a typical loaded wing truss will have <b>upon</b> the <b>load</b> distribution. The case of high angle of incidence may be dismissed immediately from consideration as the loads {{on the front and}} rear trusses are balanced, and consequently there will be little angular distortion. A given angular distortion will have the maximum effect <b>upon</b> <b>load</b> distribution in the region of the angle of no-lift, because the slope of the lift curve is highest here, and it is here that the greatest angular distortion will occur, because the load on the front truss acts downward while the load on the rear truss acts upward...|$|R
40|$|We have {{simulated}} {{the response}} of an interfacial amorphous region formed between nickel and zirconium lattices upon temperature increase or the application of uniaxial load by means of molecular-dynamics simulation of a model system based on an n -body potential. The behavior of the amorphous region has been investigated {{as a function of}} the load intensity and duration. The system reacts <b>upon</b> uniaxial <b>load</b> application with the growth of the amorphous interface. This has been related to the structural change occurring in the glassy region in the form of a density variation consequent to the introduction of excess free volume. These findings are qualitatively consistent with the current hypothesis invoked to explain diffusion and growth of interfacial amorphous regions formed <b>upon</b> <b>load</b> application on bulk diffusion couples...|$|R

25|$|Cases, {{especially}} bottleneck cases, will stretch upon firing. How much a {{case will}} stretch depends <b>upon</b> <b>load</b> pressure, cartridge design, chamber size, functional cartridge headspace (usually {{the most important}} factor), and other variables. Periodically cases need to be trimmed {{to bring them back}} into proper specifications. Most reloading manuals list both a trim size and a max length. Long cases can create a safety hazard through improper headspace and possible increased pressure.|$|R

30|$|DPM is {{also called}} APM (Automatic power Manager) in which devices are {{automatically}} powered off depending <b>upon</b> <b>load.</b> If load is low then some unused devices {{will be turned}} off automatically.
