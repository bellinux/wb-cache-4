The importance of sectoral capital intensities is emphasized. In particular, the qualitative dynamic adjustment depends <b>upon</b> the <b>relative</b> capital intensities of the import-competing consumption good sector and the non-traded investment good sector. Sectoral labor allocation effects are analyzed and the long-run effect on aggregate capital accumulation is shown to depend <b>upon</b> the <b>relative</b> capital intensities of the import and export sectors.

50|$|To {{supplement}} national {{efforts to}} upgrade indigenous technology, the 1971 Comprehensive Program emphasized cooperation {{in science and}} technology. The development of new technology was envisaged as a major object of cooperation; collaboration in resource development and specialization in production were to be facilitated by transfers of technology between members. The 1971 Comecon session, which adopted the Comprehensive Program, decided to establish the Special Council Committee for Scientific and Technical Cooperation to ensure the organization and fulfillment of {{the provisions of the}} program in this area. Jointly planned and coordinated research programs have extended to the creation of joint research institutes and centers. In terms of number of patents, documents, and other scientific and technical information exchanges, the available data indicate that the Soviet Union has been the dominant source of technology within Comecon. It has, on the whole, provided more technology to its East European partners than it has received from them, although the balance varies considerably from country to country depending <b>upon</b> <b>relative</b> levels of industrial development. Soviet science also formed the base for several high-technology programs for regional specialization and cooperation, such as nuclear power and computers (see ES EVM).|$|E
