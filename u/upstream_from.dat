5|$|Flooding of {{adjacent}} moor {{land was}} partially addressed during the 13thcentury by {{the construction of}} a number of embankment walls to contain the Parrett. They included Southlake Wall, Burrow Wall, and Lake Wall. The River Tone was also diverted by the Abbot of Athelney and other land owners into a new embanked channel, joining the Parrett <b>upstream</b> <b>from</b> its original confluence.|$|E
5|$|Jeita IV (Mugharet-el-Mal) is a rock {{shelter in}} the cliff <b>upstream</b> <b>from</b> the grotto. It once {{contained}} a large quantity of Paleolithic material which has been looted and was deemed unfit for excavation by Sami Karkaby, Director of the Caverns in 1965. Study of the lithic remains at this shelter were hoped to shed further light on the Paleolithic or Mesolithic communities that inhabited the different sites at different times.|$|E
5|$|Plunketts Creek Bridge No. 3 was a {{rubble masonry}} stone arch bridge over Plunketts Creek in Plunketts Creek Township, Lycoming County in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. It was built between 1840 and 1875, {{probably}} closer to 1840, when the road along the creek between the unincorporated villages of Barbours and Proctor was constructed. Going <b>upstream</b> <b>from</b> the mouth, {{the bridge was}} the third to cross the creek, hence its name.|$|E

5|$|Rich with sediments {{deposited}} by {{flooding and}} fed by prolific rainfall {{on the western}} side of the Cascades, the Willamette Valley {{is one of the most}} fertile agricultural regions in North America, and was thus the destination of many 19th-century pioneers traveling west along the Oregon Trail. The river was an important transportation route in the 19thcentury, although Willamette Falls, just <b>upstream</b> <b>from</b> Portland, was a major barrier to boat traffic. In the 21stcentury, major highways follow the river, and roads cross it on more than 50 bridges.|$|E
5|$|The Big Four Bridge {{was first}} {{conceived}} in Jeffersonville in 1885 by various city interests. The Louisville and Jeffersonville Bridge Company {{was formed in}} 1887 to construct the Big Four Bridge, after a charter {{by the state of}} Indiana; Kentucky also chartered the company in 1888. The riverboat industry, a big economic factor in Jeffersonville, had requested that the bridge be built further <b>upstream</b> <b>from</b> the Falls of the Ohio, but the United States Army Corps of Engineers approved the building site, even after the vocal protestations.|$|E
5|$|The Klondike {{could be}} reached only by the Yukon River, either <b>upstream</b> <b>from</b> its delta, {{downstream}} from its head, or {{from somewhere in the}} middle through its tributaries. River boats could navigate the Yukon in the summer from the delta until a point called Whitehorse, above the Klondike. Travel in general was made difficult by both the geography and climate. The region was mountainous, the rivers winding and sometimes impassable; the short summers could be hot, while from October to June, during the long winters, temperatures could drop below −50°C (−58°F).|$|E

5|$|<b>Upstream</b> <b>from</b> {{the bridge}} is a grotto and bath house, built in a similar rustic style and presumably by the same architect. The bath house is a square vaulted chamber, with a plunge pool fed by river water. The upper chamber {{comprises}} a circular saloon with windows, although this is now roofless and in poor condition. The original roof was a conical thatched structure, and a niche on the exterior wall may have housed a statue.|$|E
5|$|Wagga Wagga is <b>upstream</b> <b>from</b> the Riverina plain in the mid-catchment {{range of}} the Murrumbidgee River in an {{alluvial}} valley confined by low bedrock hills. Much of Wagga Wagga is on heavy clay soils in a large drainage basin with a small catchment discharge point. Groundwater therefore cannot leave easily, leading to Wagga Wagga having a problem with waterlogged soil and soil salination. Urban salination in Wagga Wagga is now {{the subject of a}} large multi-pronged approach to prevent further salination and reclaim salt-affected areas.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of World War I, Körös was based at Zemun, just <b>upstream</b> <b>from</b> Belgrade on the Danube. Her {{commander}} was Linienschiffsleutnant (LSL) Josef Meusburger, and she was accompanied by another three monitors and three patrol boats. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia on 28 July 1914, and that night the flotilla fired the first shots of the war against fortifications at the Zemun–Belgrade railway bridge over the river Sava and on the Topčider Hill, although Körös was not initially involved. The Serbs were outgunned by the monitors, and by August began to receive assistance from the Russians. This support included the supply and emplacement of naval guns {{and the establishment of}} river obstacles and mines.|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, sea lions gather on both sandy and rocky shores. On warm days, they lie {{closer to the}} water. At night or in cool weather, they travel farther inland or to higher elevations. Non-breeding individuals may gather at marinas, wharves, or even navigational buoys. California sea lions can also live in fresh water for periods of time, such as near Bonneville Dam, nearly 150 miles up the Columbia River. In 2004 a healthy sea lion was found sitting on a road in Merced County, California, almost a hundred miles <b>upstream</b> <b>from</b> the San Francisco Bay and {{half a mile from}} the San Joaquin River.|$|E
5|$|The Red River had {{a history}} of {{seasonal}} flooding, aggravated by the broad ancient lake bed that formed the Red River Valley. The 1997 Red River Flood caused extensive damage in the city. Fargo was <b>upstream</b> <b>from</b> the bulk of the flood waters that season, and Winnipeg had built an extensive system of flood control structures in the 1960s. In 1997 Grand Forks suffered the most damage of any major city in the Red River Valley. During the height of the flooding, a major fire destroyed eleven buildings in the downtown area. The government began developing a new levee system to protect the city, which was completed ten years later. It required the relocation of numerous residents as some neighborhoods were emptied for this construction.|$|E

5|$|The Touchet Formation was {{originally}} identified at {{the confluence of}} the Touchet River with the Walla Walla River. It is also found at some distance up the Touchet River Valley. The number of layers observed decreases as one progresses up-valley, indicating that the floodwater lakes varied in depth and distance <b>upstream</b> <b>from</b> the various flood dams. Clastic dike intrusions are observed in some locations penetrating the layers vertically; the dikes are infilled with uniform-size fine-grained materials and are indications that the period between floods was long enough that the deposits dried, forming vertical cracks and allowing wind-blown eroded materials to infill the cracks.|$|E
5|$|The boys ran to {{town for}} help, and several men, {{including}} local businessman Watson Stanley Fisher, 24, came to investigate. Fisher and others dived into the creek to find Stilwell, believing {{him to have}} suffered a seizure. After locating the boy's body and attempting to return to shore, Fisher was also bitten by the shark {{in front of the}} townspeople, losing Stilwell in the process. His right thigh was severely injured and he bled to death at Monmouth Memorial Hospital in Long Branch at 5:30p.m. Stilwell's body was recovered 150feet (46m) <b>upstream</b> <b>from</b> the Wyckoff dock on July 14.|$|E
5|$|The creek turns {{south and}} enters the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge 4.5 miles <b>upstream</b> <b>from</b> its mouth. At this point it passes through the largest {{freshwater}} marsh in Pennsylvania before becoming entirely tidal. It turns west-southwest for a few miles, passing by Philadelphia, Folcroft, Norwood, Prospect Park, Tinicum Township, and Ridley Township and receives the tributary Muckinipattis Creek from the right. Darby Creek winds through a large lagoon 30ft deep in places that was dredged in the 1960s. The creek then receives Stony Creek, its last named tributary, from the right and turns south for a few tenths of a mile before reaching its confluence with the Delaware River.|$|E
