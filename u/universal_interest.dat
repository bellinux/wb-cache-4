60|$|At {{least he}} made some such excuses {{to himself as he}} hurried along toward the Kaiserstrasse. The draught of <b>universal</b> <b>interest</b> in that {{direction}} had left the other streets almost deserted, but as he approached the thoroughfare he found all the ways blocked, and the horse-cars, ordinarily so furiously headlong, arrested by the multiple ranks of spectators on the sidewalks. The avenue leading from the railway station to the palace was decorated with flags and garlands, and planted with the stems of young firs and birches. The doorways were crowded, and the windows dense with eager faces peering out of the draped bunting. The carriageway was kept clear by mild policemen who now and then allowed one of the crowd to cross it.|$|E
60|$|THE fête at 'the Pavilion,' {{such was}} {{the title of the}} Twickenham Villa, though the subject of <b>universal</b> <b>interest,</b> was {{anticipated}} by no one with more eager anxiety than by Sir Lucius Grafton; for that day, he determined, should decide the fate of the Duke of St. James. He was sanguine as to the result, nor without reason. For the last month he had, by his dark machinery, played desperately upon the feelings of Lady Aphrodite; and more than once had she despatched rapid notes to her admirer for counsel and for consolation. The Duke was more skilful in soothing her griefs than in devising expedients for their removal. He treated the threatened as a distant evil! and wiped away her tears in a manner which is almost an encouragement to weep.|$|E
60|$|At all events, Alexander {{found himself}} {{suddenly}} elevated {{to one of}} the most conspicuous positions in the whole political world. It was not simply that he succeeded to the throne of Macedon; even this would have been a lofty position for so young a man; but Macedon was a very small part of the realm over which Philip had extended his power. The ascendency which he had acquired over the whole Grecian empire, and the vast arrangements he had made for an incursion into Asia, made Alexander the object of <b>universal</b> <b>interest</b> and attention. The question was, whether Alexander should attempt to take his father's place in respect to all this general power, and undertake to sustain and carry on his vast projects, or whether he should content himself with ruling, in quiet, over his native country of Macedon.|$|E

60|$|SUMMARY OF THE SUBJECT. We are now ready, {{if not to}} define, {{at least}} to {{understand}} a little more clearly the object of our present study. Literature is the expression of life in words of truth and beauty; it is the written record of man's spirit, of his thoughts, emotions, aspirations; it is the history, and the only history, of the human soul. It is characterized by its artistic, its suggestive, its permanent qualities. Its two tests are its <b>universal</b> <b>interest</b> and its personal style. Its object, aside from the delight it gives us, is to know man, that is, the soul of man rather than his actions; and since it preserves to the race the ideals upon which all our civilization is founded, {{it is one of}} the most important and delightful subjects that can occupy the human mind.|$|E
60|$|A {{very strong}} and an <b>universal</b> <b>interest</b> was felt in the {{approaching}} combat. Æneas, besides the prodigious strength and bravery {{for which he was}} renowned, was to be divinely aided, it was known, by the protection of his mother, who was always at hand to guide and support him in the conflict, and to succor him in danger. Achilles, on the other hand, possessed a charmed life. He had been dipped by his mother Thetis, when an infant, in the river Styx, to render him invulnerable and immortal; and the immersion produced the effect intended in respect to all those parts of the body which the water laved. As, how ever, Thetis held the child by the ankles when she plunged him in, the ankles remained unaffected by the magic influence of the water. All the {{other parts of the body}} were rendered incapable of receiving a wound.|$|E
60|$|This {{national}} and <b>universal</b> <b>interest</b> which the story produces and has produced for two centuries and among all ranks {{of people in}} a great City, where the imagination is kept for ever active and awake, first suggested to me the conception of its fitness for a dramatic purpose. In fact it is a tragedy which has already received, from its capacity of awakening and sustaining the sympathy of men, approbation and success. Nothing remained as I imagined, but to clothe it to the apprehensions of my countrymen in such language and action as would bring it home to their hearts. The deepest and the sublimest tragic compositions, King Lear and the two plays in which the tale of Oedipus is told, were stories which already existed in tradition, as matters of popular belief and interest, before Shakspeare and Sophocles made them familiar to the sympathy of all succeeding generations of mankind.|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we {{approach}} Marx’s relation with the Press. The main subject that guides this text is the sharp and critical reflection on {{the freedom of the}} press and censorship that the German philosopher offers us. If the State’s institutions defend censorship they are promoting particular <b>interests</b> and not <b>universal</b> <b>interests,</b> for press freedom does not admit objections. It is revolutionary press, this is, the proletarian literature, which is in charge of denouncing this abuse that is detrimental to the peasants. But further to this, the proletarian newspapers have to inform and intellectually educate their receptors. Basing the study in the analysis of his writings, it prooves how a great part of marxist philosophy is diseminated on newspaper pages. On the other hand, it was essential to observe Marx-journalist’s evolution: from his first theoretical-speculative phase to his posterior political-practical position...|$|R

6000|$|The {{logic of}} such a fact {{is not that the}} poet should try to achieve this truest office of his art by means of doggerel, but that he should study how and where and why the beauty and the truth he has made {{manifest}} are wanting in <b>universal</b> <b>interest,</b> in human appeal. Leaving the drama out of the question, and the theatre which seems now to be seeking only the favor of the dull rich, I believe that there never was a time or a race more open to the impressions of beauty and of truth than ours. The artist who feels their divine charm, and longs to impart it, has now and here a chance to impart it more widely than ever artist had in the world before. Of course, the means of reaching the widest range of humanity are the simple and the elementary, but there is no telling when the complex and the recondite may not universally please. 288 ...|$|E
60|$|Accordingly, on the 4th of February (1756), leaving Colonel Adam Stephens {{in command}} of the troops, Washington set out on his mission, {{accompanied}} by his aide-de-camp, Captain George Mercer, of Virginia, and Captain Stewart, of the Virginia light horse. The party travelled in Virginia style, on horseback, attended by their black servants in livery. In this way they accomplished a journey of five hundred miles in the depth of winter; stopping for some days at Philadelphia and New York. Those cities were then comparatively small, and the arrival of a party of young Southern officers attracted attention. The late disastrous battle was still the theme of every tongue, and the honorable way in which these young officers had acquitted themselves in it made them objects of <b>universal</b> <b>interest.</b> Washington's fame, especially, had gone before him; having been spread by the officers who had served with him and by the public honors decreed him by the Virginia Legislature.|$|E
60|$|We arrived, {{and entered}} the ancient harbor of the Piraeus at last. We dropped anchor within half a mile of the village. Away off, across the undulating Plain of Attica, could be seen a little square-topped hill with a {{something}} on it, which our glasses soon discovered to be the ruined edifices of the citadel of the Athenians, and most prominent among them loomed the venerable Parthenon. So exquisitely clear and pure is this wonderful atmosphere that every column of the noble structure was discernible through the telescope, and even the smaller ruins about it assumed some semblance of shape. This {{at a distance of}} five or six miles. In the valley, near the Acropolis, (the square-topped hill before spoken of,) Athens itself could be vaguely made out with an ordinary lorgnette.

60|$|The {{style of}} all these essays is gentle, old-fashioned, irresistibly attractive. Lamb was {{especially}} fond of old writers and borrowed unconsciously from the style of Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy and from Browne's Religio Medici and from the early English dramatists. But this style had {{become a part of}} Lamb by long reading, and he was apparently unable to express his new thought without using their old quaint expressions. Though these essays are all criticisms or appreciations of the life of his age, they are all intensely personal. In other words, they are an excellent picture of Lamb and of humanity. Without a trace of vanity or self-assertion, Lamb begins with himself, with some purely personal mood or experience, and from this he leads the reader to see life and literature as he saw it. It is this wonderful combination of personal and <b>universal</b> <b>interests,</b> together with Lamb's rare old style and quaint humor, which make the essays remarkable. They continue the best tradition of Addison and Steele, our first great essayists; but their sympathies are broader and deeper, and their humor more delicious than any which preceded them.|$|R
