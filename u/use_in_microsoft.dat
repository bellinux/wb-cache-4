GlobalSign's core PKI services allow its thousands of authenticated customers to conduct SSL-secured transactions, data transfer, distribution of tamper-proof code, {{and protection of}} online identities for secure email and access control. Additionally GlobalSign’s PKI services include a trusted root-chaining program for trusted PKI deployments, which allows the widely distributed and trusted GlobalSign root CA certificates to cryptographically chain subordinate root CAs for <b>use</b> <b>in</b> <b>Microsoft</b> CA and in other in-house CAs.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedTo enhance insight {{into a war}} at sea, a general, aggregated and highly flexible model of the ASW campaign is offered. This thesis provides a simple and usable circulation model template. The generality and simplicity of the model allows for 'jointization' of an ASW campaign by allowing the user to utilize other resources to define the force mix. The model is designed, first and foremost, to examine {{the change in the}} marginal effectiveness of friendly ASW forces due to changes in force level, mix, effectiveness, and employment strategies. The model is keyed to the interaction of a threat submarine with friendly ASW forces and merchant or military shipping. Specific features of the model provide for four unique attack regimes. The in port and operational regimes control friendly attacks on a daily basis while the outbound and inbound regimes control barriers by events. The campaign model is a deliverable product programmed using Borland(registered) Delphi for <b>use</b> <b>in</b> <b>Microsoft</b> Windows. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E

40|$|International {{recommendations}} for determination of referenceintervals have been recently updated, especially for small reference sample groups, {{and use of}} the robust method and Box–Cox transformation is now recommended. Unfortunately, these methods are not included in most software programs used for data analysis by clinical laboratories. We have created a set of macroinstructions, named Reference Value Advisor, for <b>use</b> <b>in</b> <b>Microsoft</b> Excel to calculate reference limits applying different methods. For any series of data, Reference Value Advisor calculates reference limits (with 90 % confidence intervals [CI]) using a nonparametric method when nZ 40 and by parametric and robust methods from native and Box–Cox transformed values; tests normality of distributions using the Anderson–Darling test and outliers using Tukey and Dixon–Reed tests; displays the distribution of values in dot plots and histograms and constructs Q–Q plots for visual inspection of normality; and provides minimal guidelines in the form of comments based on international recommendations. The critical steps in determination of reference intervals are correct selection of as many reference individuals as possible and analysis of specimens in controlled preanalytical and analytical conditions. Computing tools cannot compensate for flaws in selection and size of the reference sample group and handling and analysis of samples. However, if those steps are performed properly, Reference Value Advisor, available as freeware at [URL] www. biostat. envt. fr/spip /spip. php?article 63, permits rapid assessment and comparison of results calculated using different methods, including currently unavailable methods. This allows for selection of the most appropriate method, especially as the program provides the CI of limits. It should be useful in veterinary clinical pathology when only small reference sample groups are available...|$|E
40|$|The Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) is the UK Government’s {{approved}} {{methodology for}} assessing the energy ratings of dwellings. SAP is a calculation method based upon empirical relations from measured data. A yearly calculation was used in SAP until the release of SAP 2009, which employs monthly calculations. SAP has moved from using a large time step with a coarse time resolution to a smaller time step with a medium time resolution. Rising CO 2 emissions from dwellings advocate that properties designed in a sustainable method will become commonplace in the future. In tandem with enhanced sustainability, dwellings will increasingly be designed with implementations of renewable energy generation. The modelling of renewables in SAP has been highlighted as an area where SAP could benefit from additional research. Modelling future complex dwellings and systems will require an advanced calculation method which is capable of more detailed modelling and simulation; with a smaller time step which is measured in minutes and not months, producing results allowing more detailed analysis of energy performance. Dynamic Simulation Methods (DSMs) already exist which can operate at a very small time step. However with DSMs {{it is very difficult}} to make a comparison with SAP as the temperatures used in SAP are not well understood. To calculate energy consumption the SAP methodology guarantees that a standard occupancy temperature profile is met perfectly. A dynamic method which also guarantees the SAP standard occupancy temperature profile is required. This is difficult in complex DSMs as their control algorithms are often inadequate to optimise the heating system to guarantee that a temperature is met perfectly. The contribution to knowledge detailed in this thesis is the development of a novel SAP compliant advanced dynamic calculation method (IDEAS) v which guarantees that the SAP standard occupancy temperature profile is perfectly tracked and is also calibrated with SAP. The Inverse Dynamics based Energy Assessment and Simulation (IDEAS) method employs the perfect inverse control law RIDE to guarantee that the SAP standard occupancy temperature profile is met. IDEAS produces SAP compliant results and allows confident (i. e. calibrated in SAP) predictions to be made regarding the impact of novel heating and renewable energy systems. Researched in depth are the temperatures used in SAP, leading to analysis of the implications of tracking air temperature and various comfort temperatures. A focused evaluation of the treatment of renewables in SAP and DSMs is also presented, leading to suggestions which were implemented into the SAP framework. The role of real life monitoring in the energy assessment process is highlighted with monitored studies conducted. Also in this thesis case studies applying IDEAS to buildings with renewable heating systems are described. The IDEAS method employs SAP as an exemplar steady state calculation to highlight the successful use and calibration of a new advanced Inverse Dynamics based symbolic method. The philosophy, research and equations derived in IDEAS are presented in this thesis demonstrating their <b>use</b> <b>in</b> <b>Microsoft</b> Excel and Matlab / Simulink environments. The IDEAS methodology is transparent and portable. IDEAS can be applied to other methodologies, such as those employed by PHPP and SBEM (by carrying out a calibration process), and also to different simulation environments such as ESP-r and ESL (by adopting the IDEAS equations in those methods). The contribution to knowledge of IDEAS is demonstrated in this thesis by the development of the method and the use of SAP as a comparator. The IDEAS method has many uses outwith SAP which are highlighted in the cases studies and future work sections of this body of work. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
