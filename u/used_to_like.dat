25|$|Travis Brody (played by Lucas Till): Travis is a {{childhood}} friend from Tennessee. It is said in the movie that they both <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> each other when they were younger. The two become reacquainted during Miley's return to Tennessee in Hannah Montana: The Movie. He discovers that Miley is Hannah Montana and the two kiss, assuming that they get together. However, even though the movie does not show it, it is implied that they broke up {{due to the fact}} that Miley went back to California and their relationship would not work long distance. Also, he is not mentioned during the episodes following the movie.|$|E
500|$|To comics scholar Bart Beaty, Kalo's {{giving up}} cartooning for {{familial}} duties provides the protagonist {{an opportunity to}} evaluate his own life: his failed romances, his obsessive collecting, and {{his relationship with his}} family—in particular his mother, whose home is an emotional safety zone for him. [...] The Seth character declares, [...] "I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> to get inside cardboard boxes and close them up behind me. [...] I enjoyed being in that safe, confined space. [...] My mother's place is a lot like those boxes." ...|$|E

Miffed at being excluded, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) conducts a competing men in the workplace seminar in the warehouse. Roy Anderson (David Denman) approaches Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) under the belief that Jim <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> Pam.

500|$|The character's {{return in}} April 2008 saw drastic changes to his personality. [...] Edmondson attested that Abra {{returned}} in [...] "a fragile state" [...] following a traumatic {{incident in the}} Congo, and had become [...] "genuinely horrible". He said of the transformation: [...] "He's not as humorous {{as he used to}} be. I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> that, that sardonic wit that he used to have and it's kind of gone out of the window. But you can be quite funny when you're feeling everything's pointless. He does some things that are so cruel and cold that they're actually quite funny." [...] While the character had once been known for his brash taste in bright, flamboyant shirts, The Sun noted that Abra's return saw him a [...] "shadow of his former self", wearing far less colourful apparel as a reflection of his more subdued state of mind. [...] Edmondson agreed that Abra's new wardrobe of shirts [...] "aren't quite as bright and dazzling - but that suits his current mood." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{has been}} covered by {{artists such as}} Groove Holmes, the Troggs, Charlie McCoy, and Psychic TV. John Bush commented: [...] "'Good Vibrations' was rarely reprised by other acts, even during the cover-happy '60s. Its {{fragmented}} style made it essentially cover-proof." [...] In 1976, a nearly identical cover version was released as a single by Todd Rundgren for his album Faithful. When asked for his opinion, Brian said: [...] "Oh, he did a marvelous job, {{he did a great}} job. I was very proud of his version." [...] Rundgren's single peaked at number 34 on the Billboard Hot 100. Rundgren explained: [...] "I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> the sound of the Beach Boys, but it wasn't until they began to compete with the Beatles that I felt that what they were doing was really interesting—like around Pet Sounds and 'Good Vibrations' ... when they started to shed that whole surf music kind of burden and start to branch out into something that was a little more universal. ... I tried to do [...] as literally as I could because in the intervening 10 years, radio had changed so much. Radio had become so formatted and so structured that that whole experience was already gone." ...|$|E

2500|$|Classical and {{playback}} singer Manna Dey, who {{was also}} a contemporary of Rafi said, [...] "Rafi and I could sing everything, and he was such a gentleman. He was a better singer than me, and I will say this – that no one came even close to him! He deserved everything he got! We had a great understanding and it was never about one-upmanship". Veteran actor Shammi Kapoor said, [...] "I am incomplete without Mohammad Rafi. I used to often go for the recording of my song, which was sung by Mohammad Rafi, only because I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> telling him how I would perform on this song on screen so that he can sing it that way. Even he liked my involvement".|$|E
2500|$|Surf Hill: This ride, {{common to}} other water parks at the time, allowed patrons to slide down a water-slick sloped surface on mats into small puddles, {{until they reached}} a foam barrier after an upslope at the end. Barriers between lanes were minimal, and people {{frequently}} collided with {{each other on the}} way down, or at the end. The seventh lane was known as the [...] "back breaker", due to its special kicker two-thirds of the way down intended to allow jumps and splashdowns into a larger puddle. Employees at the park <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> eating at a nearby snack bar with {{a good view of the}} attraction, since it was almost guaranteed that they could see some serious injuries, lost bikini tops, or both. Mountain Creek kept this attraction open through 2005, then reopened it in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|The song [...] "Wu-Gambinos" [...] {{was one of}} {{the first}} songs {{recorded}} for the album, and marked the beginning of the Gambino aliases used for the members who appeared on the album, and would eventually become highly influential on hip hop. Raekwon later explained [...] "The Wu-Gambinos aliases come from how I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> that movie Once Upon a Time in America, with Robert De Niro and James Woods. I liked how these young little niggas grew up, from the ground up, not having nothing to start. And the names came. You know, [...] "Tony Starks" [...] came from Iron Man. [...] "Lou Diamond" [...] came from Louis Roederer who made Cristal, and from me being infatuated with the diamond world. Back then I was wearing a lot of ice, was calling shit ice. But then I started giving some of my niggas in the crew names. Being that it's my album, I wanted niggas to know, you gotta have a certain a.k.a. when you're on this track. This is a Gambino track. Wu-Gambinos. I would call Masta Killa [...] "Noodles," [...] call GZA [...] "Maximillian." [...] Inside the movie (Once Upon a Time in America), Noodles and Max was partners. I felt like GZA was like Maximillian because he was like the brains of the crew. He would say something real intellectual and smart. I called Deck [...] "Rollie Fingers" [...] cause of the way he roll blunts. So names just started fitting niggas." ...|$|E
