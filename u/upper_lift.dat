50|$|Almost every tractor today {{features}} Ferguson's three-point linkage or {{a derivative}} of it. This hitch allows for easy attachment and detachment of implements while allowing the implement {{to function as}} a part of the tractor, almost as if it were attached by a fixed mount. Previously, when the implement hit an obstacle, the towing link would break or the tractor could flip over. Ferguson's genius was to combine a connection via two lower and one <b>upper</b> <b>lift</b> arms that were connected to a hydraulic lifting ram. The ram was, in turn, connected to the upper of the three links so the increased drag (as when a plough hits a rock) caused the hydraulics to lift the implement until the obstacle was passed.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to explore the concurrent validity of test results of <b>upper</b> <b>lifting</b> tasks of the Ergo-Kit FCE and the Isernhagen Work Systems (IWS) FCE. Seventy-one healthy young adults performed 5 <b>upper</b> <b>lifting</b> tests with at least 5 min of rest in between. The lifting tests included 3 standard protocols and 2 modified protocols. Three criteria for concurrent validity were established: 1) Pearson correlation higher than. 75, 2) nonsignificant two-tailed t test, and 3) mean difference smaller than 5 kg. The results showed that none of the criteria were met for the standard protocols. For the modified protocols criteria 2 and 3 were not met. Individual differences larger than 10 kg were found for both standard and modified protocols. It was concluded that the standard protocols for <b>upper</b> <b>lifting</b> tasks of the Ergo-Kit FCE and the IWS FCE do not meet the criteria for concurrent validity and can, therefore, not be used interchangeably.

5000|$|The primary lift at Moonlight Basin is the Six Shooter, a {{high speed}} six pack {{chairlift}} that climbs 1850 vertical feet (564 m) {{from the base}} and is nicknamed [...] "the flying couch." [...] The Headwaters chairlift connects {{at the top of}} Six Shooter, rising another 685 feet (209 m), for a total lift-served vertical rise of 2535 feet (772 m) from the 7000 foot (2134 m) base. The other <b>upper</b> <b>lift</b> is the Lone Tree quad, installed in 2004 for the second season, which allows access to the glade like terrain northwest of the Headwaters.

40|$|Tests in the Ames 40 - by 80 -foot {{wind tunnel}} of the static {{longitudinal}} {{characteristics of the}} Republic RF- 84 F were made to determine both the origin and a suitable remedy for a pitch up tendency of the airplane encountered at moderate lift coefficients. The {{results indicated that the}} pitch-up at moderate lift coefficients was caused by an abrupt change in downwash at the tail which in turn was traceable presumably to flow conditions associated with the inlet-to-wing leading-edge discontinuity [...] Attempts to eliminate this pitch-up characteristic with various fairings and stall-control devices. were not wholly successful. The investigation revealed, however, that significant gains in the performance of the airplane could be achieved in the <b>upper</b> <b>lift</b> range [...] Three different configurations consisting of a partial-span modified leading edge combined with one or with two-fenees or a leading-edge extension each delayed the onset of separation to higher lift coefficients and provided large improvements in the stability of the airplane in the <b>upper</b> <b>lift</b> range...|$|E

40|$|After massive weight loss, breasts have poor shape, projection, {{and skin}} elasticity. The nipples are {{distorted}} and ptotic. Mastopexy {{is difficult and}} historically includes the use of excess nearby tissues. The senior author reviews his experience with 24 patients over the past 4 years. Body contouring is offered after the weight loss is stable. Breasts may be reshaped by mastopexy and/or augmentation; three examples are presented. More often the breasts are reshaped during an <b>upper</b> body <b>lift.</b> This lift is a reverse abdominoplasty that ends along the inframammary fold scar of the Wise-pattern mastopexy and extends laterally along the back roll. When the breasts need enlargement, nearby discard tissue is used for augmentation. The spiral flap has been devised for that purpose. When more tissue is needed, silicone implants are used. The long inframammary scar of the McKissock vertical bipedicle mastopexy forms the junction between the breast and reverse abdominoplasty. Proper inframammary fold construction is pivotal to the <b>upper</b> body <b>lift.</b> We have successfully combine breast reshaping with <b>upper</b> body <b>lift</b> for this difficult deformity after massive weight loss and present two demonstrative examples.

50|$|Also {{part of the}} Portes du Soleil, but {{located in}} Switzerland, Morgins has kept some of its {{traditional}} charm and is not as crowded as the larger resorts in France. The resort is not a large skyscraping hotel type of place. Rather a mix of small traditional chalets owned by local Swiss families and several chalet operators. The village has a ski torchlight descent each Wednesday during the winter which is open to all. The skiing is linked to Chatel {{on one side of}} the village and to Champoussin to the other side. In case of sparse snow this is where problems first occur: It is quite often necessary to go down by chairlift if you arrive from Chatel. The connection is also typically the first to close down altogether since the <b>upper</b> <b>lifts</b> are draglifts thus making it impossible to bring people down if the snowcover is lacking. The skiing in Morgins is comparatively easy.|$|R

5000|$|The Syrians began {{shelling}} the outpost at 14:00. All the Israeli {{soldiers in}} the outpost concentrated in the central hall of the bunker. The platoon officer and the mortar sergeant climbed up to the observation point but {{had to come back}} down due to the heavy shelling. An observation officer, a technical assistant and a driver from the 334th Artillery Battalion left the outpost in a half-track for their planned position in the [...] "tank curve" [...] to help pinpoint the artillery in the northern Golan. Six Syrian MiG-17 aircraft attacked the outpost. Three of the helicopters arrived from the west. Two of them landed about thirty paratroopers on Hill 2072, south of the lower ski lift. Most of the Syrian force deployed above the curve south of the <b>upper</b> ski <b>lift</b> to block access to the outpost. A few of them advanced toward the outpost to provide cover. A third helicopter with sixteen paratroopers, who were supposed to block the [...] "tank curve", crashed (a rotor-blade hit the slope). Only three paratroopers survived and joined their comrades at the <b>upper</b> ski <b>lift.</b> They opened fire on the Israeli half-track, which kept driving.

Three Golani soldiers at the <b>upper</b> ski <b>lift</b> observation post saw the Syrian landing but failed to fire at them due to a machine gun malfunction. After a few minutes, they abandoned their post, which was equipped with a radio, and went down to the lower ski lift to join a platoon positioned there without informing the outpost of the Syrian landing.|$|R

50|$|At around 21:00, the outpost {{commander}} {{decided to}} try to escape to the lower ski lift. Due to a lack of communication with the other men, only he, five officers and eleven soldiers got out. They crossed a minefield, went down the Bul'an valley and headed west toward the <b>upper</b> ski <b>lift.</b> Just before 23:00, as they began to head down a rocky slope from the <b>upper</b> ski <b>lift,</b> the Syrian blocking force saw them and opened fire. The platoon commander and five of his men charged down the hill. Three were killed, including the platoon commander, two were taken prisoner the next day. Other officers and soldiers took cover and returned fire. The observation officer was badly wounded and later died. The other eleven, some of whom were wounded, escaped the encounter and scattered. The escapees ran down the road and encountered three Israeli tanks heading their way. One of the tanks fired at them before they could identify themselves. During the night and the next day, ten of them made their way back to the Israeli lines. A soldier from the Air Force unit in the outpost accidentally entered a 183rd Syrian Battalion position, deployed on high point 1614. He was caught and executed the next day.|$|R

50|$|While the 51st Battalion was {{climbing}} up the Hermon mountainside, the motorized column with two tanks kept advancing up the road toward the outpost. The tanks were followed by the 17th Battalion forces in the following order: Company C, under Captain Yaakov Sela, the reconnaissance company's squad commanders course company, totaling at thirty-three fighters on three half-tracks. The fourth half-track was the 17th Battalion commander's command post. Drori's command half-track, followed by Company B, with eighty fighters on seven half-tracks. The brigade doctor, Captain Doctor Shraga Myblum, with two paramedics from the brigade infirmary, joined one of the half-tracks. The advance was uneventful until the lower ski-lift position. The tanks deployed {{in the parking lot}} south of the ski lift and fired at the constructions, which were empty since the 13th Battalion fighters left them on Sunday. The constructions were searched and it turned out the Syrians did not reach them. The Israeli flag was removed to be hoisted on the outpost after its recapture. A tracked bulldozer belonging to a contractor who had worked on the <b>upper</b> ski <b>lift</b> was started on Drori's order and attached to the column in case a roadblock was needed.
