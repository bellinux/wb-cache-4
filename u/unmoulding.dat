50|$|A Romanesque chapel, St. John's is on {{the second}} floor of the White Tower, which was built in 1077-97 as a keep or citadel, the oldest part of William the Conqueror's {{powerful}} fortress. It was constructed from stone imported from France, and has a tunnel-vaulted nave with an east apse and groin-vaulted aisles, and the gallery above curves around the apse.

The slices, salted and peppered, are layered into a pan (see below), generously doused with clarified butter, and baked/fried until they form a cake. Then they are turned upside down every ten minutes until the outside is golden and crisp.

Below the transom were the main entry doors, with glazed panels and side lights matching the flanking windows. A radial fanlight filled the lunette above the transom.

50|$|The {{second phase}} {{consists}} of applying {{a layer of}} raw clay inside the mould, which can be incised beforehand {{in order to obtain}} effects of relief. The thinness of the layer varies according to the type of object to be realized. The faces of the mould are joined together, the object is then <b>unmoulded,</b> and the craftsman can proceed to the final improvements, typically smoothing the junction. The craftsman also creates a small opening, a vent hole that allows steam to escape during the firing. The vent can also be used for assembly, allowing intervention inside the piece. The limbs are then joined to the body either by pasting them with slip, clay mixed with water, or by mortice and tenon joint.|$|R

30|$|For the {{characterization}} of chemical resistance {{with respect to the}} acids environment the mortars were run in prismatic moulds (4  ×  4  ×  16) cm 3. After 24  h, the samples were <b>unmoulded</b> and preserved in water. After 28  days of cure, the samples are immersed in a solution of 5  % of strong sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4). The variation of the weight of samples is examined at different age. The chemical solution is renewed every 7  days. At the day of the test the parts of mortar having undergoes a visible degradation are cleaned carefully with water, thereafter the samples are dried during half an hour with the free air (ASTM C 267 - 96), the chemical resistance in acid medium is evaluated by the measurement of the loss of weight of specimens.|$|R
50|$|The White Meetinghouse {{stands in}} an {{isolated}} rural setting in southwestern Eaton, at {{the southeast corner of}} Towle Corner Road and Burnham Road. It is a single story wood frame building, with a gable roof and clapboarded exterior. The main facade is relatively plain in decoration, with a pair of entry doors framed by sidelights and <b>unmoulded</b> casings. The doorways lead into separate small vestibules, which provide entry to the main chamber. The auditorium is oriented with slip pews facing the front of the building, with two tiers of raised pews in the rear for the choir.

The building has never been wired for electricity, and is heated by a wood stove with a winding funnel pipe leading to the chimney.|$|R

A replica is a work that is created directly from, and is practically indistinguishable from, its original. The replicas in our Museum are, in general, not crafted from the same material as the original. Most are casts of plaster or resin, not marble or bronze, for the obvious reasons of expense and weight. The replicas by large workshops—such as those at the Louvre, Paris, the British Museum, London, and the Gipsformerei der Staatlichen Museen, Berlin—are created from moulds taken directly from the original pieces. They therefore replicate exactly any damage borne by the original. After the plaster cast is <b>unmoulded,</b> it is painted and given a surface finish which matches the original.|$|R

Queen Elfrida, after Edgar’s death, murdered his eldest son, King Edward the Martyr, and founded the Nunnery of Wor-well.
