40|$|According to neoclassical {{economic}} theory, a stated preference elicitation format comprising {{a single}} binary {{choice between the}} status quo and one alternative is incentive compatible under certain conditions.

We find evidence to suggest that presenting multiple choice tasks per respondent decreases estimates of expected willingness to pay. Preferences stated in the first of a sequence of choice tasks are not significantly different from those stated in the incentive compatible single binary choice task, but, in subsequent choice tasks, responses are influenced by cost levels observed in past questions. Three behavioural explanations can be advanced – weak strategic misrepresentation, reference point revision and cost-driven value learning.

40|$|Today, nearly {{everyone}} recognizes {{the need for}} the United States to diversify its energy resources. Wind energy on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts alone could generate as much as the equivalent of the current U. S. generating capacity. Despite this potential, not one offshore wind project exists in the United States; I argue that this is largely due to the unwieldy regulatory scheme that developers must navigate. The recent decision, Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, Inc. v. Energy Facilities Siting Board, (Alliance) {{is a prime example of}} how the lack of cohesiveness between the state and federal governments impede the development of this much needed energy resource. In Alliance, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court considered a citizen group’s appeal of a state agency’s decision regarding the construction of <b>underground</b> and undersea <b>electricity</b> transmission cables integral to the first proposed offshore wind farm project in the United States.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} productivity {{trends in}} the Australian utilities industry and highlights some significant issues relating to the measurement and interpretation of changes in measured productivity over time. Key findings: Multifactor productivity (MFP) growth in Australia’s market sector has been considerably below average since 2003 - 04. Utilities (Electricity, Gas, Water and Waste services), have {{played a significant role}} in this, with MFP growth being strongly negative between 1997 - 98 and 2009 - 10 (MFP falling, on average, by 3. 2 per cent per year). To better understand why, this study examined MFP at the subdivision level, with a particular focus on the two largest subdivisions — Electricity supply (ES), and Water supply, sewerage and drainage services (WSSD). MFP growth between 1997 - 98 and 2009 - 10 was negative for both ES (on average, - 2. 7 per cent per year) and WSSD (- 4. 3 per cent per year). Around half of the MFP decline in ES was due to an increase in the ratio of peak to average electricity demand, which lowered average rates of capacity utilisation. This was largely attributable to rapid growth in household use of airconditioners. – Three other contributors were: cyclical investment in lumpy capital assets, which temporarily increased inputs ahead of growth in output; a shift to greater <b>undergrounding</b> of <b>electricity</b> cabling, which raised costs and the quality of output, but not the volume of measured output; and policy induced shifts away from coal-fired power to higher-cost, but less polluting, sources of new supply. In WSSD, two developments contributed around 80 per cent of the decline in MFP after 1997 - 98. First, restrictions on water demand in response to widespread drought conditions led to lower measured output. Second, stricter sewage treatment standards increased industry costs, but there was no adjustment to measured output to account for the quality improvement. – Two other contributing factors were cyclical investment patterns, and a shift to higher-cost sources of new water supplies, particularly desalination plants, to improve water security. The negative influence on utilities MFP growth of two of these influences — the cyclical surge in new investment and the 2000 s drought — is expected to be largely temporary. However, the remaining factors are structural, permanently raising input requirements in the industry (though in some cases bringing an increase in the quality of outputs). This study highlights some of the challenges involved in measuring and interpreting estimates of MFP growth in utilities. – A particular concern is the influence of changes in capacity utilisation arising from either cyclical investment patterns, or changes in the structure of electricity demand. – Also, government policies, regulatory settings and external shocks (especially the weather) can impact on the quantity or quality of measured output, and on the choice of production technology, thereby influencing estimates of MFP...|$|R
40|$|The water {{pipeline}} industry {{is one of}} the key industries that serve the basic public needs of the society. Just like other essential utilities such as gas and <b>electricity,</b> <b>underground</b> cables are required to transport this vital human need from one part of the city to another. From Dubai to Paris, virtually all cities around the world have underground pipes serving the same purpose and the city of Kuantan isn’t any different. Due to the importance of these water pipes, it is necessary to device reliable means of protecting them from various forms of damages. For a system that affects the human existence so much, a pipe failure would be disastrous, as would an extended repair outage. Experience has shown that many pipelines get damaged when construction workers accidentally strike pipes buried underground, during excavation or other tasks that require digging the earth’s surface. This occurs due to the fact that most existing pipes are represented in two dimensional (2 D) format and the information contained in 2 D maps isn’t entirely accurate. This limitation in 2 D visualization makes it difficult to clearly understand or conceptualize the pipelines below the ground, hence, the need for a more effective way of visualizing the underground water pipes. Three dimensional (3 D) visualization is increasingly being used to overcome these limitations, but not many individuals or organisations can afford the huge cost of most of the available packages and there is a growing demand for more affordable 3 D visualization tools. This research has devised a means of visualizing underground water pipes using a series of software packages, including the ArcGIS 3 D Analyst extension. The integration of datasets with these packages is vital to the actualization of the research objectives. This research will illustrate how such integration is possible using the ESRI geodatabase for data storage, and exporting the dataset into other environments for visualization purposes...|$|R
40|$|Deregulation of the {{electricity}} sector liberated {{the electricity}} sale and production for competitive forces while in the network business, electricity transmission and distribution, natural monopoly positions were recognised. Deregulation was accompanied by efficiencyoriented thinking on the whole electricity supply industry. For electricity distribution this meant a transition from a public service towards profit-driven business guided by economic regulation. Regulation is the primary means to enforce societal and other goals in the regulated monopoly sector. The design of economic regulation is concerned with two main attributes; end-customer price and quality of electricity distribution services. Regulation limits {{the costs of the}} regulated company but also defines the desired quality of monopoly services. The characteristics of the regulatory framework and the incentives it provides are therefore decisive for the electricity distribution sector. Regulation is not a static factor; changes in the regulatory practices cause discontinuity points, which in turn generate risks. A variety of social and environmental concerns together with technological advancements have emphasised the relevance of quality regulation, which is expected to lead to the large-scale replacement of overhead lines with <b>underground</b> cables. The <b>electricity</b> network construction activity is therefore currently witnessing revolutionary changes in its competitive landscape. In a business characterised by high statutory involvement and a high level of sunk costs, recognising and understanding the regulatory risks becomes a key success factor. As a response, electricity distribution companies have turned into outsourcing to attain efficiency and quality goals. This doctoral thesis addresses the impacts of regulatory risks on electricity network construction, which is a commonly outsourced activity in the electricity distribution network sector. The chosen research approach is characterised as an action analytical research on account of the fact that regulatory risks are greatly dependent on the individual nature of the regulatory regime applied in the electricity distribution sector. The main contribution of this doctoral thesis is to develop a concept for recognising and managing the business risks stemming from economic regulation. The degree of outsourcing in the sector is expected to increase in years to come. The results of the research provide new knowledge to manage the regulatory risks when outsourcing services...|$|R

This thesis explores a new method to assess the quantity of <b>underground</b> <b>electricity</b> cables which could one day become available for urban mining. This research answers the question: ”To what extent can topological networks be used to localize and quantify underground metal cables {{in order to assess}} the quantity of an underground urban mine?” Three case study areas in Amsterdam have been selected to exemplify the method. The Dutch National Road Network {{has been used as a}} topological skeleton to approximate the electrical network. Three different methods were used to connect buildings and transformers to this network. The ’Connect to Closest Point’ method, connects every point to the closest point on the street network. The ’Connect to Closest Junction Vertex’ method connects every point to the closest junction vertex of the street network, which is divided into segments with maximum length of 75 meters. The ’Iteratively Connect to the Closest Junction Vertex’ method iteratively connects every point to the closest junction vertex, within a threshold, until all nodes are connected to the street network. By evaluating the edge betweenness [Girvan and Newman, 2002] for every edge in the topological networks, cable current and thickness could be determined and the urban mine was quantified in terms of electrical cables. The ’Connect to Closest Junction Vertex’ method showed to be most accurate, with up to 88 % accuracy in Geuzenveld. Although this method is suitable for finding a minimum quantity of an underground urban mine, locational accuracy is too low to pinpoint the exact location of underground cables.
