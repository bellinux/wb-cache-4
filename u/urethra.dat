5|$|The {{bacteria}} that cause urinary tract infections typically enter the bladder via the <b>urethra.</b> However, infection may also occur via the blood or lymph. It {{is believed that}} the bacteria are usually transmitted to the <b>urethra</b> from the bowel, with females at greater risk due to their anatomy. After gaining entry to the bladder, E. Coli are able to attach to the bladder wall and form a biofilm that resists the body's immune response.|$|E
5|$|Another {{option is}} to insert a small pellet of {{medication}} into the <b>urethra,</b> but this requires higher doses than injections {{and may not be}} as effective. Topical medications to dilate the blood vessels have been used, but are not very effective or well tolerated. Electrical stimulation of efferent nerves at the S2 level can be used to trigger an erection that lasts as long as the stimulation does.|$|E

40|$|The fine angioarchitecture of {{the penis}} {{of the dog}} was {{observed}} with use of Neoprene latex cast preparations. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. The cavernous systems of the dog penis consist {{of a pair of}} the corpus cavernosum penis, the corpus cavernosum <b>urethrae,</b> which has a bilobed bulbus <b>urethrae</b> at the ventral penile root, and the glans. In the glans, there are two independent cavernous bodies, the bulbus glandis and pars longa glandis. 2. Main arteries, supplying the penis of the dog, consist of a pair of A. pudenda externa and interna. Each A. pudenda interna gives off A. perinealis to be continued by A. penis at the ishial arch. After a short distance, A. penis branches off A. bulbi <b>urethrae</b> and A. profunda penis to be continued by A. dorsalis penis. A. dorsalis penis gives off several circumflex branches in its course, and near the glans divides into three branches; preputial, superficial and deep ones. A. pudenda externa nourishes mainly the prepuce, but some branches, anastomosing with three branches of A. dorsalis penis, supply blood to the glans through the fornix of the prepuce. 3. In the corpus cavernosum penis, A. profunda penis divides into clumps of three or several vessels. Each vessel shows irregular, swelling and constricted lumen in its course and enters directly into the sinuses. These vessels correspond to the so-called helicine arteries. 4. The proximal half of the corpus cavernosum <b>urethrae</b> and bulbus <b>urethrae</b> are supplied by A. bulbi <b>urethrae,</b> and the distal half of the former is nourished by branches of A. dorsalis penis. In the corpus cavernosum <b>urethrae,</b> the appearance of the vascular connection is similar to that in the corpus cavernosum penis; the cavervous sinuses receive directly the arterial blood from the helicine-like arteries. 5. The cavernous sinus of the bulbus glandis receives the venous blood through Vv. intercavernosae caudales, which begin from the corpus cavernosum <b>urethrae,</b> but no direct communication with an artery is found. 6. The cavernous sinus of the pars longa glandis receives also the venous blood through Vv. intercavernosae craniales, which begin also from the corpus cavernosum <b>urethrae.</b> In addition, the venous blood, which is drained from the subepithelial vascular plexus of the glans, flows into this cavernous sinus. but the sinus does not receive any arterial blood. 7. In the subepithelial vascular plexus of the glans, numerous typical arteriovenous anastomoses are found. 8. The main veins, which drain blood of the penis of the dog, are V. pudenda interna and externa. V. pudenda interna collects blood of V. dorsalis penis, V. profunda penis, V. bulbi <b>urethrae</b> and V. perinealis. Each of them draind blood from the sinuses of the bulbus glandis, of the corpus cavernosum penis, of the corpus cavernosum <b>urethrae</b> and the penis muscles respectively. 9. V. profunda penis, V. bulbi <b>urethrae</b> and V. perinealis are not confluent to a common trunk, but form a venous plexus {{at the root of the}} penis. V. pudenda externa drains blood from the pars longa glandis and prepuce. The so-called "deep veins of the glans" of CHRISTENSEN were not found in this observation...|$|R
5|$|In 2001, the Federative Committee on Anatomical Terminology {{accepted}} female prostate as {{an accurate}} {{term for the}} Skene's gland, which {{is believed to be}} found in the G-spot area along the walls of the <b>urethra.</b> The male prostate is biologically homologous to the Skene's gland; it has been unofficially called the male G-spot because it can also be used as an erogenous zone.|$|E
5|$|Some sources {{state that}} in {{contrast}} to the glans penis, the clitoral glans lacks smooth muscle within its fibrovascular cap and is thus differentiated from the erectile tissues of the clitoris and bulbs; additionally, bulb size varies and may be dependent on age and estrogenization.

40|$|Purpose: Although {{long-term}} outcomes {{after initial}} placement of artificial urinary sphincters are established, limited data exist comparing sphincter survival {{in patients with}} compromised <b>urethras</b> (prior radiation, artificial urinary sphincter placement or urethroplasty). We evaluated artificial urinary sphincter failure in patients with compromised and noncompromised <b>urethras.</b> Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 86 sphincters placed at a single institution between December 1997 and September 2012. We assessed patient demographic, comorbid disease and surgical characteristics. All nonfunctioning, eroded or infected devices were considered failures. Results: Of the 86 patients reviewed 67 (78 %) had compromised <b>urethras</b> and had higher failure rates than the noncompromised group (34 % vs 21 %, p= 0. 02). Compared to the noncompromised group, cases of prior radiation therapy (HR 4. 78; 95 % CI 1. 27, 18. 04), urethroplasty (HR 8. 61; 95 % CI 1. 27, 58. 51) and previous artificial urinary sphincter placement (HR 8. 14; 95 % CI 1. 71, 38. 82) had a significantly increased risk of failure. The risk of artificial urinary sphincter failure increased with more prior procedures. An increased risk of failure was observed after 3. 5 cm cuff placement (HR 8. 62; 95 % CI 2. 82, 26. 36) but not transcorporal placement (HR 1. 21; 95 % CI 0. 49, 2. 99). Conclusions: Artificial urinary sphincter placement in patients with compromised <b>urethras</b> from prior artificial urinary sphincter placement, radiation or urethroplasty had a statistically significant higher risk of failure than placement in patients with noncompromised <b>urethras.</b> Urethral mobilization and transection performed during posterior urethroplasty surgeries likely compromise urethral blood supply, predisposing patients to failure. Patients with severely compromised <b>urethras</b> from multiple prior procedures may have improved outcomes with transcorporal cuff placement rather than a 3. 5 cm cuff...|$|R

5|$|Women {{are more}} prone to UTIs than men because, in females, the <b>urethra</b> is much shorter and closer to the anus. As a woman's {{estrogen}} levels decrease with menopause, her risk of urinary tract infections increases due to the loss of protective vaginal flora. Additionally, vaginal atrophy that can sometimes occur after menopause is associated with recurrent urinary tract infections.|$|E
5|$|Uropathogenic E. coli {{from the}} gut {{is the cause}} of 80–85% of community-acquired urinary tract infections, with Staphylococcus saprophyticus being the cause in 5–10%. Rarely they may be due to viral or fungal infections. Healthcare-associated urinary tract infections (mostly related to urinary catheterization) involve a much broader range of {{pathogens}} including: E. coli (27%), Klebsiella (11%), Pseudomonas (11%), the fungal pathogen Candida albicans (9%), and Enterococcus (7%) among others. Urinary tract infections due to Staphylococcus aureus typically occur secondary to blood-borne infections. Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium can infect the <b>urethra</b> but not the bladder. These infections are usually classified as a urethritis rather than urinary tract infection.|$|E
5|$|A UTI affects {{parts of}} the urinary system {{including}} the <b>urethra,</b> bladder, and kidneys. There is about a one percent risk of UTIs in boys under two years of age, {{and the majority of}} incidents occur {{in the first year of}} life. There is good but not ideal evidence that circumcision of babies reduces the incidence of UTIs in boys under two years of age, and there is fair evidence that the reduction in incidence is by a factor of 310 times (100 circumcisions prevents one UTI). Prevention of UTIs does not justify routine use of the procedure, however. Circumcision is most likely to benefit boys who have a high risk of UTIs due to anatomical defects, and may be used to treat recurrent UTIs.|$|E

5|$|Adult elk usually stay in single-sex {{groups for}} most of the year. During the mating period known as the rut, mature bulls compete for the attentions of the cow elk and will try to defend females in their harem. Rival bulls {{challenge}} opponents by bellowing and by paralleling each other, walking back and forth. This allows potential combatants to assess the other's antlers, body size and fighting prowess. If neither bull backs down, they engage in antler wrestling, and bulls sometimes sustain serious injuries. Bulls also dig holes in the ground, in which they urinate and roll their body. A male elk's <b>urethra</b> points upward so that urine is sprayed almost at a right angle to the penis. The urine soaks into their hair and gives them a distinct smell which attracts cows.|$|E
5|$|If {{exposed to}} testosterone, the genital {{tubercle}} elongates {{to form the}} penis. By fusion of the urogenital folds– elongated spindle-shaped structures {{that contribute to the}} formation of the urethral groove on the belly aspect of the genital tubercle– the urogenital sinus closes completely and forms the spongy <b>urethra,</b> and the labioscrotal swellings unite to form the scrotum. In the absence of testosterone, the genital tubercle allows for formation of the clitoris; the initially rapid growth of the phallus gradually slows and the clitoris is formed. The urogenital sinus persists as the vestibule of the vagina, the two urogenital folds form the labia minora, and the labioscrotal swellings enlarge to form the labia majora, completing the female genitalia. A rare condition that can develop from higher than average androgen exposure is clitoromegaly.|$|E
5|$|Physical sexual {{stimulation}} of the clitoris {{is the most common}} way for women to achieve orgasm; general statistics indicate that 70–80 percent of women require direct clitoral stimulation (consistent manual, oral or other concentrated friction against the external parts of the clitoris) to reach orgasm, though indirect clitoral stimulation (for example, via vaginal penetration) may also be sufficient for female orgasm. The area near the entrance of the vagina (the lower third) contains nearly 90percent of the vaginal nerve endings, and there are areas in the anterior vaginal wall and between the top junction of the labia minora and the <b>urethra</b> that are especially sensitive, but intense sexual pleasure, including orgasm, solely from vaginal stimulation is occasional or otherwise absent because the vagina has significantly fewer nerve endings than the clitoris.|$|E

Both groups had significantly decreased serum sodium and chloride values and significantly increased serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and plasma protein concentrations compared to the normal group. Steers with ruptured bladders were more dehydrated, had significantly lower serum sodium and chloride values and had significantly higher blood urea nitrogen concentrations than steers with ruptured <b>urethras.</b> The combination of a decreased serum sodium, a decreased serum chloride, and a decreased ratio of serum phosphate to blood urea nitrogen occurred consistently within the ruptured bladder group.

5|$|The {{premise of}} a repentant murderer seeking {{to atone for}} their actions {{appears to have been}} based on the real-life case of Albert Fish, who practised severe self-harm after killing twelve-year-old Grace Budd. Fish would insert needles into his {{perineum}} and force rose stems along his <b>urethra</b> to be forcibly pulled out. However, the actual murders may have been inspired by the case of Susan Smith, a mother of two who drowned her children by sinking her car in a lake. Mention is also made in the episode of Arthur Shawcross, whose recidivism is cited by Garry's prosecutors as an example of why murder should warrant a death penalty. Shawcross was released from prison after serving a sentence for killing two children, only to kill eleven women while on parole.|$|E
5|$|The thin corpus spongiosum of {{the penis}} {{runs along the}} {{underside}} of the penile shaft, enveloping the <b>urethra,</b> and expands at the end to form the glans. It partially contributes to erection, which are primarily caused by the two corpora cavernosa that comprise the bulk of the shaft; like the female cavernosa, the male cavernosa soak up blood and become erect when sexually excited. The male corpora cavernosa taper off internally on reaching the spongiosum head. With regard to the Y-shape of the cavernosa– crown, body, and legs– the body accounts for much more of the structure in men, and the legs are stubbier; typically, the cavernosa are longer and thicker in males than in females.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{anatomical}} study, {{the penis}} {{can be described}} as a clitoris that has been mostly pulled out of the body and grafted on top of a significantly smaller piece of spongiosum containing the <b>urethra.</b> With regard to nerve endings, the human clitoris's estimated 8,000 or more (for its glans or clitoral body as a whole) is commonly cited as being twice as many as the nerve endings found in the human penis (for its glans or body as a whole), and as more than any other part of the human body. These reports sometimes conflict with other sources on clitoral anatomy or those concerning the nerve endings in the human penis. For example, while some sources estimate that the human penis has 4,000 nerve endings, other sources state that the glans or the entire penile structure have the same amount of nerve endings as the clitoral glans, or discuss whether the uncircumcised penis has thousands more than the circumcised penis or is generally more sensitive.|$|E

The bladder's epithelium is termed transitional epithelium which contains a superficial layer of dome-like cells and multiple layers of stratified cuboidal cells underneath when evacuated.
