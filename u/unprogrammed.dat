25|$|India {{has four}} yearly meetings—the <b>un{{programmed}}</b> Mid-India Yearly Meeting, programmed Bhopal Yearly Meeting, and the Mahoba Yearly Meeting. Bundelkhand Yearly Meeting is an evangelical Friends Church affiliated to Evangelical Friends International. Other programmed and <b>unprogrammed</b> worship groups are {{not affiliated with}} any yearly meeting.|$|E
25|$|Friends in Australia and New Zealand {{follow the}} <b>unprogrammed</b> tradition, similar to Britain Yearly Meeting.|$|E
25|$|Friends meet every Sunday {{morning at}} 10:30a.m. for <b>unprogrammed</b> Meeting for Worship. Everyone is welcome to attend.|$|E
25|$|German Yearly Meeting is <b>unprogrammed</b> and liberal, and has 340 members, worshipping in 31 meetings, in Germany and in Austria.|$|E
25|$|A {{meeting for}} worship for the solemnisation of {{marriage}} in an <b>unprogrammed</b> Friends meeting is similar to any other <b>unprogrammed</b> Meeting for Worship. The pair exchange vows before God and gathered witnesses, and the meeting returns to open worship. At the rise of meeting, the witnesses, including the youngest children, are asked to sign the wedding certificate as a record. In Great Britain, Quakers keep a separate record of the union and notify the General Register Office.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{positions}} {{from other}} <b>unprogrammed</b> Quaker meetings {{not affiliated with}} FGC include that taken by North Pacific Yearly Meeting and Pacific Yearly Meeting, which support same-sex marriage.|$|E
25|$|Ireland Yearly Meeting is <b>unprogrammed</b> {{and is more}} {{conservative}} than Britain Yearly Meeting. They have 1,591 members in 28 meetings across the Republic of Ireland, and in Northern Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Necroptosis is a {{programmed}} form of necrosis, or {{inflammatory cell}} death. Conventionally, necrosis {{is associated with}} <b>unprogrammed</b> cell death resulting from cellular damage or infiltration by pathogens, in contrast to orderly, programmed cell death via apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of these}} factors, {{performances}} of Wagner's {{works in the}} modern state of Israel did not occur during the twentieth century, by consensus. In recent years many Israelis have argued {{that it is possible}} to appreciate his musical talents, without implying acceptance of his political or social beliefs. A public performance in Tel Aviv in 2001 of Wagner’s prelude to Tristan und Isolde, conducted as an <b>unprogrammed</b> encore by Daniel Barenboim, left its audience partly delighted, partly enraged.|$|E
25|$|The highest {{concentration}} of Quakers is in Africa. The Friends of East Africa were {{at one time}} part of a single East Africa Yearly Meeting, then the world's largest yearly meeting. Today, this region is served by several distinct yearly meetings. Most of these are affiliated with the Friends United Meeting, practise programmed worship and employ pastors. Friends meet in Rwanda and Burundi, {{as well as new}} work beginning in North Africa. Small <b>unprogrammed</b> meetings exist also in Botswana, Ghana, Lesotho, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa and Zimbabwe.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, the {{predominantly}} liberal and <b>unprogrammed</b> Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in Britain, has 478 local meetings, {{and a total}} of 14,260 adult members, and an additional 8,560 non-member adults who attend worship and 2,251 children. The number has declined steadily since the mid-20th century. Programmed meetings occur, including in Wem and London. Small groups of Conservative Friends meet in Ripley and Greenwich in England, and Arbroath in Scotland, who follow Ohio Yearly Meeting's Book of Discipline.|$|E
25|$|Considerable {{distances}} between the colonies and {{small numbers of}} Quakers meant that Australia Friends were dependent on London until the 20th century. The Society remained <b>unprogrammed</b> and is named Australia Yearly Meeting, with local organizations around seven Regional Meetings: Canberra (which extends into southern New South Wales), New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia (which extends into Northern Territory), Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia. The Friends' School is found in Hobart. An annual meeting each January, is hosted by a different Regional Meeting over a seven-year cycle, with a Standing Committee each July or August. The Australia Yearly Meeting published This We Can Say: Australian Quaker Life, Faith and Thought, in 2003.|$|E
25|$|Necroptosis is a {{programmed}} form of necrosis, or {{inflammatory cell}} death. Conventionally, necrosis {{is associated with}} <b>unprogrammed</b> cell death resulting from cellular damage or infiltration by pathogens, in contrast to orderly, programmed cell death via apoptosis. The discovery of necroptosis showed that cells can execute necrosis in a programmed fashion and that apoptosis is not always preferable to necrotic cell death. Furthermore, the immunogenic nature of necroptosis favors its use in certain circumstances, such as aiding targeting of pathogens by the immune system. Necroptosis is well defined as a viral defense mechanism, allowing the cell to undergo “cellular suicide” in a caspase-independent fashion {{in the presence of}} viral caspase inhibitors. In addition to being a response to disease, necroptosis has also been characterized as a component of inflammatory diseases such as Crohn’s disease, pancreatitis, and myocardial infarction.|$|E
25|$|DNA damage {{can also}} cause {{epigenetic}} changes. DNA damage is very frequent, occurring on average about 60,000 times a day per cell {{of the human body}} (see DNA damage (naturally occurring)). These damages are largely repaired, but at the site of a DNA repair, epigenetic changes can remain. In particular, a double strand break in DNA can initiate <b>unprogrammed</b> epigenetic gene silencing both by causing DNA methylation as well as by promoting silencing types of histone modifications (chromatin remodeling - see next section). In addition, the enzyme Parp1 (poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase) and its product poly(ADP)-ribose (PAR) accumulate at sites of DNA damage as part of a repair process. This accumulation, in turn, directs recruitment and activation of the chromatin remodeling protein ALC1 that can cause nucleosome remodeling. Nucleosome remodeling has been found to cause, for instance, epigenetic silencing of DNA repair gene MLH1. DNA damaging chemicals, such as benzene, hydroquinone, styrene, carbon tetrachloride and trichloroethylene, cause considerable hypomethylation of DNA, some through the activation of oxidative stress pathways.|$|E
2500|$|Some Friends {{also hold}} [...] "Semi-Programmed" [...] Worship, which brings {{programmed}} {{elements such as}} hymns and readings into an otherwise <b>unprogrammed</b> worship service.|$|E
2500|$|Generally in Africa and Latin America, [...] most {{meetings}} are programmed {{and under the}} care of either FUM or EFI although meetings in [...] Central and Southern Africa are unprogrammed; in Asia, many of the {{meetings are}} <b>unprogrammed</b> and have connections with more liberal groups elsewhere in the world.|$|E
2500|$|A local [...] in the <b>unprogrammed</b> {{tradition}} {{is called a}} meeting, or a monthly meeting (e.g., Smalltown Meeting or Smalltown Monthly Meeting). The reference to [...] "monthly" [...] is because the meeting meets monthly to conduct the group's business. Most [...] "monthly meetings" [...] meet for worship {{at least once a}} week; some meetings have several worship meetings during the week. In programmed traditions, local congregations are often referred to as [...] "Friends Churches".|$|E
2500|$|Around 79% of Quakers {{worldwide}} {{belong to}} the [...] "evangelical" [...] and [...] "programmed" [...] branches of Quakerism—these Quakers worship in services with singing and a prepared message from the Bible, coordinated by a pastor. Around 11% of Friends practice waiting worship, or <b>unprogrammed</b> worship (more commonly known today as Meeting for Worship), where the order of service is not planned in advance, is predominantly silent, and may include unprepared vocal ministry from those present. Some meetings of both types have Recorded Ministers in their meetings—Friends recognised for their gift of vocal ministry.|$|E
2500|$|Gurneyite Friends (aka Friends United Meeting Friends), are {{the modern-day}} {{followers}} of the Evangelical Quaker theology which was first proclaimed by Joseph John Gurney, a 19th-century British Friend. They make up 49% {{of the total number}} of Quakers worldwide. They regard Jesus Christ as their Teacher and Lord, and favour working closely with other Protestant Christian churches. Gurneyite Friends place more emphasis on the authority of the Bible as the direct Word of God than on personal and direct experience of God in their lives. Both children and adults participate in ongoing religious education which emphasises orthodox Christian teaching from the Bible, and in relationship to both orthodox Christian Quaker history and Quaker testimonies. Gurneyite Friends subscribe to a set of orthodox Christian doctrines, such as those found in the Richmond Declaration of faith. In subsequent years, conflict arose among Gurneyite Friends in relation to the Richmond Declaration of faith. Thus, after a while, the Richmond Declaration of faith was adopted by nearly all of the Gurneyite yearly meetings. The Five Years Meeting of Friends reaffirmed their loyalty to the Richmond Declaration of faith in 1912, but specifically stated that it was not to constitute a Christian creed. Although Gurneyism was the main form of Quakerism in Great Britain in the 19th century, Gurneyite Friends are today located in America, Ireland, Africa and India. Many Gurneyite Friends combine [...] "waiting worship" [...] (<b>unprogrammed</b> worship), with religious practices commonly found in other Protestant Christian churches, such as the reading of the Bible and the singing of Hymns. A small minority of Gurneyite Friends practice entirely <b>unprogrammed</b> worship.|$|E
2500|$|Drones {{are roughly}} {{comparable}} in intelligence {{and social status}} {{to that of the}} Culture's biological members. Their intelligence is measured against that of an average biological member of the Culture; a so-called [...] "1.0 value" [...] drone would be considered the mental equal of a biological citizen, whereas lesser drones such as the menial service units of Orbitals are merely proto-sentient (capable of limited reaction to <b>unprogrammed</b> events, but possessing no consciousness, and thus not considered citizens; these take care of much of the menial work in the Culture). The sentience of advanced drones has various levels of redundancy, from systems similar to that of Minds (though much reduced in capability) down to electronic, to mechanical and finally biochemical back-up brains.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>unprogrammed</b> Ireland Yearly Meeting, which {{includes}} meetings in Northern Ireland, has no recent public statement on its attitudes towards homosexuality. In regard to same-sex unions, in 1993, the IYM declared [...] "we {{believe in the}} institution of marriage, and in common with many others are currently wrestling {{with the problem of}} what our attitude should be to the other forms of human relationships which are increasingly being accepted by society at large." [...] Subsequent statements have continued to fail to resolve this issue. While their position on marriage remains divided the IYM has decided to include un-married gay partnerships in the 'family and relationships' section of their forthcoming book of guidance 'Quaker Life – the Christian Experience of the Religious Society of Friends in Ireland' which is due for publication in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Unprogrammed</b> worship (also {{known as}} waiting worship, [...] "silent worship", or holy communion {{in the manner}} of Friends) is based on the {{practices}} of George Fox and the Early Friends, who based their religious beliefs and practices on their interpretation of how the early Christians worshipped God their Heavenly Father. Friends gather together in [...] "expectant waiting upon God" [...] to experience his still small voice leading them from within. There is no plan on how the meeting will proceed, and actual practice varies widely between Meetings and individual worship services. Friends believe that God plans what will happen, with his spirit leading people to speak. When a participant feels led to speak, he or she will stand and share a spoken message of ("vocal ministry") in front of others. When this happens, Quakers believe that the spirit of God is speaking through the speaker. After someone has spoken, it is customary to allow a few minutes pass in silence for reflection on what has been said, before further vocal ministry is given. Sometimes a meeting is entirely silent, sometimes many speak. These meetings lasted for several hours in George Fox's day. Modern meetings are often limited to an hour, ending when two people (usually the elders) exchange the sign of peace by handshake. This handshake is often shared by the others. This style of worship is the norm in Great Britain, Ireland, the continent of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Southern Africa, Canada, and parts of the United States (particularly yearly meetings associated with Friends General Conference and Beanite Quakerism)—constituting about 11% of Quakers. Those who worship in this style hold each person to be equal before God and capable of knowing the light of God directly. Anyone present may speak if they feel led to do so. Traditionally, Recorded Ministers were recognised for their particular gift in vocal ministry. This religious practice continues among Conservative Friends and Liberal Friends (e.g. New York Yearly Meeting). Many meetings where Liberal Friends predominate abolished this religious practice. London Yearly Meeting of Friends abolished the acknowledging and recording of Recorded Ministers in 1924.|$|E
50|$|Africa Section {{represents}} Friends {{throughout the}} continent of Africa. Most African Friends are from the evangelical and programmed traditions. However, a significant minority are from the <b>unprogrammed</b> tradition. South Africa Yearly Meeting is principally an <b>unprogrammed</b> Yearly Meeting and there are <b>unprogrammed</b> Meetings elsewhere in Africa, notably in Kenya. Africa Section is numerically the most numerous of the Sections and the administrative headquarters are in Nairobi, Kenya. The 2012 Friends World Conference was held in Kenya.|$|E
