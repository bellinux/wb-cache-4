500|$|Richard Dawkins {{dedicated}} {{a chapter}} in The Blind Watchmaker to correcting, in his view, the wide confusion regarding <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> change. His first point is to argue that phyletic gradualism — understood {{in the sense that}} evolution proceeds at a single <b>uniform</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> speed, <b>called</b> [...] "constant speedism" [...] by Dawkins — is a [...] "caricature of Darwinism" [...] and [...] "does not really exist." [...] His second argument, which follows from the first, is that once the caricature of [...] "constant speedism" [...] is dismissed, we are left with one logical alternative, which Dawkins terms [...] "variable speedism." [...] Variable speedism may also be distinguished one of two ways: [...] "discrete variable speedism" [...] and [...] "continuously variable speedism." [...] Eldredge and Gould, proposing that evolution jumps between stability and relative rapidity, are described as [...] "discrete variable speedists," [...] and [...] "in this respect they are genuinely radical." [...] They assert that evolution generally proceeds in bursts, or not at all. [...] "Continuously variable speedists," [...] on the other hand advance that [...] "evolutionary rates fluctuate continuously from very fast to very slow and stop, with all intermediates. They see no particular reason to emphasize certain speeds more than others. In particular, stasis, to them, is just an extreme case of ultra-slow evolution. To a punctuationist, there is something very special about stasis." [...] Dawkins therefore commits himself here to an empirical claim about the geological record, in contrast to his earlier claim that [...] "The paleontological evidence can be argued about, and I am not qualified to judge it." [...] It is this particular commitment that Eldredge and Gould have aimed to overturn.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{efficiency}} of nitrogen fertilizer in corn is usually low, negatively affecting plant nutrition, the economic return, and the environment. In this context, a variable <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> nitrogen, prescribed by crop sensors, {{has been proposed}} {{as an alternative to}} the <b>uniform</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> nitrogen traditionally used by farmers. This study tested the hypothesis that variable <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> nitrogen, prescribed by optical sensor, increases the nitrogen use efficiency and grain yield as compared to <b>uniform</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> nitrogen. The following treatments were evaluated: 0; 70; 140; and 210 kg ha- 1 under <b>uniform</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> nitrogen, and 140 kg ha - 1 under variable <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> nitrogen. The nitrogen source was urea applied on the soil surface using a distributor equipped with the crop sensor. In this study, the grain yield ranged from 10. 2 to 15. 5 Mg ha- 1, with linear response to nitrogen rates. The variable <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> nitrogen increased by 11. 8 and 32. 6 % the nitrogen uptake and nitrogen use efficiency, respectively, compared to the <b>uniform</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> nitrogen. However, no significant increase in grain yield was observed, indicating that the major benefit <b>of</b> the variable <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> nitrogen was reducing the risk of environmental impact of fertilizer...|$|R
