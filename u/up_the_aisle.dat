5|$|After {{the guests}} take their seats, Scott starts {{to worry that}} Charlene will not show up, but Paul and Mike assure him {{that she will be}} there. Reverend Sampson (Howard Bell) then invites {{everyone}} to stand as Charlene and Henry begin their walk <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b> Scott and Charlene exchange vows and Reverend Sampson pronounces them man and wife. At the reception, Jim tells Scott that he is proud of him and welcomes Charlene to the family. Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) finds Madge crying in the kitchen and he comforts her. They are interrupted by Mrs. Mangel (Vivean Gray) who informs them that the telegrams from Max and Maria, Clive and Rosemary, who all are unable to attend, are being read out. Dan Ramsay (Syd Conabere) spots a mouse and tries to pick it up, but hits Mrs. Mangel's foot. She accuses Dan of groping her and as he protests his innocence, an argument breaks out among the guests. Scott and Charlene go to his bedroom and Gail brings them a gift from her father. Jane comes to tell Charlene {{that it is time to}} get changed for the honeymoon, while Paul takes their bags out to the car. Lucy tells Scott that she will miss him and he gives her his skateboard. Everyone gathers in the street to wave the couple off. Mrs. Mangel catches Charlene's bouquet, as the couple drive out of Ramsay Street.|$|E
5|$|The {{engagement}} {{was declared}} on 5 December 1865, {{and despite the}} Prince of Wales's initial refusal to attend, Princess Alice intervened, and the wedding was a happy occasion. The Queen allowed the ceremony to take place at Windsor Castle, albeit in the Private Chapel rather than the grander St George's Chapel on 5 July 1866. The Queen relieved her black mourning dress with a white mourning cap which draped over her back. The main participants filed into the chapel {{to the sound of}} Beethoven's , creating a spectacle only marred by the sudden disappearance of Prince George, the Duke of Cambridge, who had a sudden gout attack. Christian filed into the chapel with his two supporters, Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar and Prince Frederic of Schleswig-Holstein, and Helena was given away by her mother, who escorted her <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> with the Prince of Wales and eight bridesmaids. Christian looked older than he was, and one guest commented that Helena looked as if she was marrying an aged uncle. Indeed, when he was first summoned to Britain, he assumed that the widowed Queen was inspecting him as a new husband for herself rather than as a candidate for one of her daughters. The couple spent the first night of their married life at Osborne House, before honeymooning in Paris, Interlaken and Genoa.|$|E
25|$|Gomez, in his 2000 autobiography, {{wrote about}} Duke:He once {{presented}} a {{bill on the}} floor, {{one of the few}} which he had managed to get out of committee. He finished his opening presentation and strolled with great self-satisfaction back <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> to his seat. In his mind, he had spoken, made his presentation and that was that. Before he had even reached his desk and re-focused on the proceedings, another first-term member had been recognized for the floor and immediately moved to table the bill. The House voted for the motions effectively killing the bill. That and similar procedures were used against him many times. Gomez said that he recalls Duke obtaining the passage of only a single bill, legislation which prohibited movie producers or book publishers from compensating jurors for accounts of their court experiences.|$|E

6000|$|She dashed it in scorn to the marble-paved ground [...] Where it fell mute as snow, and a weird music-sound [...] Crept up, like a chill, <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> {{long and}} dim,-- [...] As the fiends tried to mock at the choristers' hymn [...] And moaned in the trying.|$|R
50|$|Procession path (Latin: ambitus templi): {{the route}} taken by processions on solemn days in large churches <b>up</b> <b>the</b> north <b>aisle,</b> round behind <b>the</b> high altar, down <b>the</b> south <b>aisle,</b> and then <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{centre of the}} nave.|$|R
500|$|At Torchwood's Cardiff headquarters, Owen determines from {{an autopsy}} that the alien that {{impregnated}} Gwen is a Nostrovite, {{a race of}} carnivorous shape shifters who hunt in pairs and mate for life. He tells Jack that after fertilisation, the female transfers her eggs to the male who plants them in a host body until {{they are ready to}} hatch. Later, the female kills the host to release the offspring. At the wedding venue, the female Nostrovite (Colette Brown) murders and partly devours wedding guest Mervyn. Toshiko investigates along with Rhys' best man [...] "Banana Boat" [...] (Jonathan Lewis Owen) and they are subsequently captured by the alien, who intends to feed on them later. As Gwen and Rhys prepare to say their wedding vows, Jack runs <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> and demands that the wedding be halted. Owen and Ianto (Gareth David-Lloyd) free Toshiko but the half-eaten corpse of Mervyn is discovered by his wife, a bridesmaid, who alerts the entire wedding party to the murder. The Nostrovite reveals herself and is chased away by Jack, escaping through a window.|$|E
500|$|Ray Harding {{wrote the}} script for [...] "Episode 523". Bruce Andrews from Charles Sturt University noted that {{it is one of}} only a few Neighbours episodes to include the entire cast. The {{producers}} asked Rod Hardy to direct the episode, due to his experience of directing other television weddings. Hardy believed that [...] "the magic of the episode" [...] is captured best in two close-up shots of Scott and Charlene. The director recalled [...] "The image that stays with me is the close-up of Kylie as she arrives and then the close-up on Jason's face, and those two looks epitomised what the whole scene was about." [...] The episode was shot [...] "in great secrecy" [...] three months before it was broadcast on Australian television. The shoot was initially delayed due to bad weather. Due to a limited budget, there were very few extras on set and crew were asked to stand in at the church instead. The scenes were shot in soft focus, creating [...] "a halo effect" [...] around Charlene as she walked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b>|$|E
2500|$|At the United States Naval Academy, a {{tradition}} developed that included marching flags, including the American flag, <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> {{of the chapel}} during Protestant services, briefly dipping the flags toward the altar. According to an academy spokesman quoted in a 2006 article, this flag-dipping ritual at the USNA Protestant chapel [...] "is the only one throughout the Navy where the flag has been incorporated in that way." ...|$|E
60|$|Those of {{the people}} who have seen the play before very kindly explain how it ends, so as to help the rest to enjoy it. But the more serious-minded of the men have risen, very gently, and are sneaking <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles.</b> Their {{expression}} is stamped with deep thought as if pondering over the play. But their step is as that of leopards on the march, and no one is deceived as to their purpose.|$|R
60|$|She was in rapture {{over the}} glory of color, the waving grasses of smooth hillsides, and the radiant dapple {{of light and shadow}} beneath the groves of vivid yellow aspens. The cactus and Spanish dagger, and the ever-present sage bush of the lower levels, had disappeared, crow's-foot and blue-joint grasses swung in the wind. The bright flame of the painted cup and the purple of the asters still lighted <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> of <b>the</b> pines in {{sheltered}} places.|$|R
50|$|In World War I song-and-dance man Jerry Jones (George Murphy) is {{drafted into}} the US Army, where he stages a revue called Yip Yip Yaphank. It is a rousing success, but one night during the show orders are {{received}} to leave immediately for France: instead of the finale, <b>the</b> troops march <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> through <b>the</b> audience, out the theater's main entrance and into a convoy of waiting trucks. Among the teary, last-minute goodbyes Jones kisses his newlywed bride Ethel (Rosemary DeCamp) farewell.|$|R
2500|$|With the bride's mother {{interfering with}} wedding plans (such as {{arranging}} horses dressed as unicorns and butterflies to release by the bridesmaids), Raif {{finds out that}} Saskia is the rebellious Saskia he knew at school. Spending an increasing amount of time with her during the wedding arrangements, Raif and Saskia kiss after {{the stress of the}} planning takes its toll on her. [...] Eventually revealing this to Tim en route to the wedding, they decide to intercept Saskia {{on her way to the}} church. [...] Tim asks Saskia whether she really wants the marriage to go ahead; she tearfully says [...] "no". [...] Arriving late to the church, the three make their way <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> to the altar, where Tim announces that his and Saskia's wedding will not proceed. [...] However, Raif steps forward and the vicar conducts a brief, but non-legal, ceremony for Raif and Saskia.|$|E
2500|$|Two days later, on the {{afternoon}} of May 22, Brooks confronted Sumner as he sat writing at his desk in the almost empty Senate chamber: [...] "Mr. Sumner, I have read your speech twice over carefully. [...] It is a libel on South Carolina, and Mr. Butler, who is a relative of mine." [...] As Sumner began to stand up, Brooks beat Sumner severely on the head before he could reach his feet, using a thick gutta-percha cane with a gold head. Sumner was knocked down and trapped under the heavy desk, which was bolted to the floor, but Brooks continued to strike Sumner until Sumner ripped the desk from the floor. [...] By this time, Sumner was blinded by his own blood, and he staggered <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> and collapsed, lapsing into unconsciousness. Brooks beat the motionless Sumner until his cane broke, at which point he continued to strike Sumner with the remaining piece. Several other Senators attempted to help Sumner, but were blocked by Keitt who brandished a pistol and shouted, [...] "Let them be!" ...|$|E
60|$|Mike walked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> to Mr Bickersdyke's room, {{and went}} in.|$|E
5000|$|Alexander {{also changed}} the Travelers' {{performance}} style from the [...] "flat-footed" [...] style of early quartets to the church-wrecking style {{of other groups}} of their era. The singers would punctuate their singing by jumping off stage and running <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> in order, in Alexander's words, [...] "to pull the sisters out of their seats". They cemented their popularity {{with a series of}} [...] "mother songs", which replayed the same themes of gratitude and guilt for all that mother had done to steer them toward salvation.|$|R
6000|$|Out of {{the mist}} of strange faces, blurred hordes of people who swaggered <b>up</b> <b>the</b> office <b>aisle</b> so knowingly, and grinned at her when she asked questions, individualities began to take form: ...|$|R
25|$|Generally, Springer {{tends to}} present his program {{standing}} <b>up</b> pacing <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> steps between <b>the</b> seating areas rather than having a podium or mark on the main stage. This {{is thought to be}} to protect himself from the potential violence occurring on the stage.|$|R
60|$|So the grey-eyed, war-worn Wulf strode <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> and, {{standing}} by the altar rails, saluted her.|$|E
60|$|Murmurs of {{surprise}} and indignation broke out on all sides. The Leiter motioned the soldiers {{to follow him}} <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mr. Miller {{waved his}} hands in a gesture of divine despair, spun round, darted <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> turned, and bounded back.|$|E

60|$|As at {{the other}} weddings, the {{ceremony}} was set for high noon. Soon the guests began to arrive, and before long the old church was crowded to its capacity, with many standing <b>up</b> in <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> and in <b>the</b> rear and even at the side windows, which were wide open.|$|R
60|$|<b>Up</b> <b>the</b> broad center <b>aisle</b> we marched beneath deadly silence, and at {{the foot}} of the thrones we halted.|$|R
60|$|<b>Up</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> came {{my father}} very erect and solemn, and behind him {{followed}} Falcone with eyes a-twinkle in his weather-beaten face.|$|E
6000|$|They {{followed}} the others into the lounge, walking together <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b> [...] "You know," [...] Thacher said, [...] "I don't even know your name, yet." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{girl who}} stood before it started visibly when Violet walked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b> She was slight and spare, with vivacious {{blue eyes and}} fluffy brown hair.|$|E
5000|$|Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) - {{the final}} {{shot of the}} {{government}} warehouse was painted on glass by Michael Pangrazio at Industrial Light and Magic, and combined with live-action footage of a government worker pushing <b>the</b> crate <b>up</b> <b>the</b> center <b>aisle.</b>|$|R
60|$|The boys ran forward, {{after making}} sure that their baggage was tumbled into a baggage-car. As the {{conductor}} had said, the cars were overcrowded, {{and they had to}} stand <b>up</b> in <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b> A number of the men were smoking and they continued to do so, even though it was against the rules.|$|R
6000|$|That pause {{while the}} {{procession}} {{was getting into}} order, <b>the</b> slow movement <b>up</b> <b>the</b> centre <b>aisle,</b> <b>the</b> week-day atmosphere of the church, brought back to her thoughts a very different time, {{and one of those}} strange echoings on the mind repeated in her ears the words, [...] "For man walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth himself in vain--" ...|$|R
60|$|The Regent {{moved closer}} to the aisle, that he might meet the impostor {{at the foot of the}} chancel steps. The {{procession}} was moving steadily <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b>|$|E
60|$|Like {{everyone}} else, I turned frankly round. She {{was coming}} <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> {{on the arm}} of a hard-faced, rather gipsy-looking man, dressed in a farmer's very best.|$|E
60|$|The {{ceremony}} {{was already in}} progress. Creeping on tiptoe <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> I was about to slip into an empty pew, when a hand was laid upon my sleeve.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Carmyle {{broke off}} to brood once more, and before Sally could speak the {{impressive}} bulk of Fillmore loomed <b>up</b> in <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> beside them. Explanations seemed to Fillmore {{to be in}} order. He cast a questioning glance at the mysterious stranger, who, {{in addition to being}} in conversation with his sister, had collared his seat.|$|R
60|$|Able and {{powerful}} as was Mr. Crewe's discourse, {{the man and}} not the words had fastened the wandering attention of Austen Vane. He did not perceive his friend of the evening before, Mr. Widgeon, coming towards him <b>up</b> <b>the</b> side <b>aisle,</b> until he felt a touch on the arm.|$|R
6000|$|Popularity {{followed}} {{him from the}} small New England college to the Harvard Law School. He had been soberer there, marked as a pleader, and at last the day arrived when he was summoned by a great New York lawyer to discuss his future. Sunday intervened. Obeying a wayward impulse, {{he had gone to}} one of the metropolitan churches to hear a preacher renowned for his influence over men. There is, indeed, much that is stirring to the imagination in the spectacle of a mass of human beings thronging into a great church, pouring <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles,</b> crowding <b>the</b> galleries, joining with full voices in the hymns. What drew them? He himself was singing words familiar since childhood, and suddenly they were fraught with a startling meaning! ...|$|R
