40|$|Abstract. A {{group of}} 8 HII regions has been {{detected}} {{at a distance}} of 10 kpc from the Sun at galactic longitude 298 ◦, using Hα wavelength observations. The observations were made with a scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer to provide a detailed Hα profile, which enables us to separate these distant HII regions from the 3 other layers of ionized gas seen along <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of sight. A comparison of 5 GHz continuum and IRAS data allows us to analyse the nature of each source. Most of the distant HII regions were already known as radio sources or IRAS sources but one of them has no radio or IRAS counterpart. Inversely, IRAS sources without radio continuum nor an Hα counterpart have been detected.

As part of a detached unit from Task force 77, two destroyers; , Hanson, cruiser [...] and battleship [...] were sent on a gun strike in Hungnam harbor. Hanson, along with the Helena would get instructions to blow up railroad movements along the Korean coast. Helena would bombard one end of a rail road tunnel as the train entered it and Hanson would bombard the other end once the train was within the tunnel. Immediately afterward Korean work crews would descend upon the rail road tracks and tunnel(s) to repair the damage. Hanson would then call in carrier planes armed with napalm to bomb the North Korean work crews. At another time, Earnest G. Small and Missouri stayed a few miles off shore. Helena and Hanson were firing at targets close to the harbor, taking instructions from spotters on shore. As evening approached Hansons gyro was failing which meant Hanson could not fire on targets accurately. Earnest G. Small was ordered to take over Hanson's close in position and Hanson move out to the position of the Missouri. Earnest G. Small steamed toward Hanson's former position and less than 5 minutes at 1801 hours 7 October 1951 Earnest G. Small struck a mine and lost 1/3 of their ship. The entire bow was blown off.
