On September27, 2007, the West Virginia Division of Forestry's <b>urban</b> <b>forestry</b> coordinator Bob Hannah and technical specialist Jennifer Brashears engaged in an inspection and evaluation of the tree to provide recommendations. In their report, Hannah and Brashears assessed that the tree's [...] "severe structural weakness" [...] was not caused by the fire, and instead highlighted the tree's [...] "size, age, and severity of defects" [...] as the cause of its instability. They did, however, assess that the fire may have caused further mortality of the tree's cambium. They used various measurements developed by the International Society of Arboriculture and the United States Forest Service to formulate a tree risk assessment. At the time of their investigation, the tree's diameter at breast height was , with 27% of the trunk consisting of open space. Hannah and Brashears also found that one-third of the lower trunk and root crown demonstrated callus formation and no new growth, but instead severe decay and peeling bark. Hannah and Brashears further determined that structural mitigation was not feasible, and that the Webster Sycamore was to be [...] "considered an extreme hazard" [...] and the public should be [...] "excluded from its striking zone through fencing and signage".|$|E

[...] He was a strong proponent of building a light rail system in Portland when proposed in the 1970s—the MAX system which opened in 1986 and has expanded since—as well as other public transit investments in downtown, including the Portland Transit Mall, Fareless Square, Portland Vintage Trolley, and the Portland Streetcar. [...] He led a successful effort to plant more than 10,000 trees in the city, as founder of the Street Tree Advisory Committee, which became Portland's <b>Urban</b> <b>Forestry</b> Commission and which he chaired from 1976 until his death. [...] He donated space to start Portland's Saturday Market, a popular arts and crafts market that has been held in the Old Town/Chinatown district continuously since 1974.
