40|$|This paper conducts an empirically {{study on}} the <b>trade</b> <b>package</b> {{composed}} of a sequence of consecutive purchases or sales of 23 stocks in Chinese stock market. We investigate the probability distributions of the execution time, the number of trades and the total trading volume of <b>trade</b> <b>packages,</b> and analyze the possible scaling relations between them. Quantitative differences are observed between the institutional and individual investors. The trading profile of <b>trade</b> <b>packages</b> is investigated to reveal the preference of large trades on trading volumes and transaction time of the day, and the different profiles of two types of investors imply that institutions may be more informed than individuals. We further analyze the price impacts of both the entire <b>trade</b> <b>packages</b> and the individual transactions inside <b>trade</b> <b>packages.</b> We find the price impact of <b>trade</b> <b>packages</b> is nonnegligible over {{the period of the}} execution time and it may have a power-law relation with the total trading volume. The price impact of the transactions inside <b>trade</b> <b>packages</b> displays a U-shaped profile with respect to the time $t$ of the day, and also shows a power-law dependence on their trading volumes. The trading volumes of the transactions inside <b>trade</b> <b>packages</b> made by institutions have a stronger impact on current returns, but the following price reversals persist over a relatively shorter horizon in comparison with those by individuals. ...|$|R

One strand {{of the literature}} documents that single trades in futures markets contain information, whereas another strand finds that <b>trade</b> <b>packages</b> in futures markets do not contain information. This study controls for methodological and sample differences in examining the price impact of individual <b>trades</b> and <b>trade</b> <b>packages.</b> We find little evidence that transactions in futures markets contain information. 16 page(s...|$|R

40|$|In multi-species {{fisheries}} managed under ITQs, {{the existence}} of joint production may lead to complex catch-quota balancing issues. Previous modelling and experimental research suggest that, in such fisheries, some fishers may benefit from the ability to <b>trade</b> <b>packages</b> of fishing quotas, rather than fulfil their quota needs by simultaneously bidding on separate single-species quota markets. This note presents evidence of naturally occurring <b>package</b> <b>trades</b> in a real fishery. Based on this evidence, we suggest that further empirical and modelling research is required on the potential and limitations of <b>package</b> quota <b>trading</b> in mixed fisheries managed with ITQs. © 2014...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{theoretical}} papers {{suggest that}} large informed traders should make misleading or random trades to disguise their trading. Alternatively, informed traders may trade purely on their estimate of stock value. This paper examines {{the case of}} a large institutional investor that periodically trades in the wrong direction, i. e., makes occasional sell (buy) <b>trades</b> within <b>packages</b> of buy (sell) trades. Using a unique data set, we show that three quarters of the <b>trade</b> <b>packages</b> include wrong-direction <b>trades.</b> We describe the characteristics of the wrong-direction trades and show that they appear to be used more to disguise trade direction because they are relatively small, executed on low-volume days, and not very profitable, although gains on wrong-trade buys may offset losses on wrong-trade sells...|$|R

This paper examines the trading {{behavior of a}} large institutional insider that periodically trades in the wrong direction, i. e., makes occasional sell (buy) <b>trades</b> within <b>packages</b> of buy (sell) trades. Using a hand-collected data set, we find that {{three quarters of the}} <b>trade</b> <b>packages</b> include wrong-direction <b>trades.</b> Wrong trades appear to be used mostly to disguise right-direction trades. We find that the wrong-trade stocks are larger and have less noisy returns, hence, they lack natural disguise. Wrong trades are relatively small, used to accentuate return volatility, distributed evenly during a <b>package</b> of <b>trades,</b> and are not consistently profitable.

The Local Currency Payment System (SML) framework is investigated {{as an instrument}} of reducing trade costs by providing new financial integration mechanisms and its implications according to <b>usual</b> <b>trade</b> issues debate. We cut across different issues related to the SML rationale. Additionally, we describe and analyze the data available for the system showing that the SML use is more common to Brazilian exports than to Argentine ones. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} for {{measuring}} trade potential from border effects is developed {{and applied to}} manufactured trade between the old fifteen European Union (EU) members and twelve Central and East European (CEE) economies. Border effects are estimated with three theoretically compatible trade specifications, and much larger trade potentials are obtained than predicted by <b>usual</b> <b>trade</b> potential models. Even {{after a decade of}} regional trade liberalization, the integration of CEE and EU economies is two to three times weaker than intra-EU integration, revealing a large potential for East-West European trade.

40|$|The {{literature}} on unemployment has mostly focused on labor market issues while {{the impact of}} capital foonation is largely neglected Job-creation is often {{thought to be a}} matter of encouraging more employment on a given capital stock. In contrast, this paper explicitly deals with the long-run consequences of institutional shocks on capital foonation and employment. It is shown that the <b>usual</b> <b>trade</b> off between employment and wages disappears in the long run. In line with an appropriation model, the estimated values for the long-run elasticities of substitution between capital and labor for Germany and France are substantially greater than one...|$|R

Although we do not observe the directional asymmetry typically shown in the literature, {{the magnitude of the}} total and permanent effects for purchases is larger than for sales. We also show that price impact is related to fund inflows and outflows. 15 page(s...|$|R
