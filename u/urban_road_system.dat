The paper uses economic theory of the second best and a simulation model to compare first-best, second-best and no-toll solutions for a model with two routes and two time periods (peak and pre-peak). The main findings from the simulation results are: (1) the second-best scheme is effective but less efficient than the first-best scheme in reallocating traffic volumes; (2) the second-best tolls are appreciably smaller than the first-best tolls; (3) the welfare gains from the second-best policy are much smaller than the welfare gains that are possible with a complete set of first-best tolls. It is also shown that the nature of the simulation results is not sensitive to reasonable cost and demand parameters. ...|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that accident rates {{tend to be}} higher at intersections than on through sections of a road. This is particularly frequent in urban area where roads are characterized by intersections in close succession; moreover, the safe and effective operations of the <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>system</b> can be significantly affected by safety conditions at intersections.

An exploratory example describes how to formulate an accident model for urban intersections by the analysis of significant explanatory variables affecting accident phenomenon and by modelling of accident and traffic data for urban intersections.

40|$|Intersections are the {{bottlenecks}} of the <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>system</b> {{because an}} intersection's capacity {{is only a}} fraction of the flows that the roads connecting to the intersection can carry. This capacity can be increased if vehicles can cross the intersections in platoons rather than one by one as they do today. Platoon formation is enabled by connected vehicle technology. This paper assesses the potential mobility benefits of platooning. It argues that saturation flow rates, and hence intersection capacity, can be doubled or tripled by platooning. The argument is supported by the analysis of three queuing models and by the simulation of a road network with 16 intersections and 73 links. The queuing analysis and the simulations reveal that a signalized network with fixed time control will support an increase in demand by a factor of (say) two or three if all saturation flows are increased by the same factor, with no change in the control. Furthermore, despite the increased demand vehicles will experience the same delay and travel time. The same scaling improvement is achieved when the fixed time control is replaced by the max pressure adaptive control. Part of the capacity increase can alternatively be used to reduce queue lengths and the associated queuing delay by decreasing the cycle time. Impediments to the control of connected vehicles to achieve platooning at intersections appear to be small. Comment: To appear in the Journal of Transportation Research Part...|$|E

40|$|Rapid {{urbanization}} {{has greatly}} altered the urban metabolism {{of material and}} energy. As {{a significant part of}} the infrastructure, <b>urban</b> <b>roads</b> are being rapidly developed worldwide. Quantitative analysis of metabolic processes on <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>systems,</b> especially the scale, composition and spatial distribution of their stocks, could help to assess the resource appropriation and potential environmental impacts, as well as improve urban metabolism models. In this paper, an integrated model, which covered all types of roads, intersection structures and ancillary facilities, was built for calculating the material stocks of <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>systems.</b> Based on a bottom-up method, the total stocks were disassembled into a number of stock parts rather than obtained by input output data, which provided an approach promoting data availability and inner structure understanding. The combination with GIS enabled the model to tackle the complex structures of road networks and avoid double counting. In the case study of Beijing, the following results are shown: 1) The total stocks for the entire <b>road</b> <b>system</b> reached 159 million tons, of which nearly 80 % was stored in roads, and 20 % in ancillary facilities. 2) Macadam was the largest stock (111 million tons), while stone mastic asphalt, polyurethane plastics, and atactic polypropylene accounted for smaller components of the overall system. 3) The stock per unit area of pedestrian overcrossing was higher than that of the other stock units in the entire system, and its steel stocks reached 0. 49 t/m(2), which was 10 times as high as that in interchanges. 4) The high stock areas were mainly distributed in ring-shaped and radial expressways, as well as in major interchanges. 5) Expressways and arterials were excessively emphasized, while minor roads were relatively ignored. However, the variation of cross-sectional thickness in branches and neighborhood roads will have a significant impact on the scale of material stocks in the entire <b>road</b> <b>system.</b> (C) 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|In 1975, the Dutch {{government}} {{presented a}} paper outlining a traffic and transport {{policy for the}} next five years. It was given the title: "Towards managed traffic". In this paper the government notes that the great growth in car ownership and usage has been one factor in worsening the human environment, and that this applies particularly to the towns. The <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>system</b> is not adapted to present-day traffic flows; parking is an increasingly pressing problem; busy road have become barriers; cities {{are becoming more and more}} unsafe for non-motorists; destinations have become less accessible. Noise, air pollution and vibration are worsening the climate in which we sojourn and live; picturesque views in towns are being spoiled. In order to counteract this worsening of the urban environment, the Dutch government has set itself a number of tasks. The following two may be mentioned as part of its traffic and transport policy: - to promote road safety; - to satisfy certain standards in order to create a high-quality environment in which to live. In giving consideration to these, of course, a certain demand for transport will have to be taken into account. One can say that a traffic and transport policy nowadays is really nothing else but weighing the advantages of meeting the demand for transport against the disadvantages this causes elsewhere. One of these disadvantages is road hazards. An improvement in the human environment will also have to promote road safety. Accident statistics show that the urban safety problem is primarily a slow-traffic problem: nearly three out of every four traffic fatalities inside built-up areas are moped riders, cyclists or pedestrians. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the government has made it a major policy objective that urban road safety, especially for slow traffic, will have to be vigorously promoted...|$|E

40|$|City {{growth and}} changes in land-use {{patterns}} cause various important social and environmental impacts. To understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of these processes, the factors that drive urban development must be identified and analyzed, especially those factors {{that can be used}} to predict future changes and their potential environmental effects. Our objectives were to quantify the relationship between urban growth and its driving forces and to predict the spatial growth pattern based on historical land-use changes for the city of Los Ángeles in central Chile. This involved the analysis of images from 1978, 1992, and 1998 and characterization of the spatial pattern of land-use change; the construction of digital coverage in GIS; the selection of predictive variables through univariate analysis; the construction of logistic regression models using growth vs. nongrowth for 1978 - 1992 as the dependent variable; and the prediction of the probability of land-use change by applying the regression model to the 1992 - 1998 period. To investigate the influence of spatial scale, we constructed several sets of models that contained (1) only distance variables, e. g., distance to highways; (2) only scale-dependent density variables, e. g., density of urban area within a 600 -m radius; (3) both distance and density variables; and (4) both distance and density variables at several spatial scales. The environmental variables were included in all models. The combination of distance and density variables at several scales is required to appropriately capture the multiscale urban growth process. The best models correctly predict ~ 90 % of the observed land-use changes for 1992 - 1998. The distance to access roads, densities of the <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>system</b> and urbanized area at various scales, and soil type were the strongest predictors of the growth pattern.

40|$|Urban {{transportation}} systems {{are vulnerable to}} congestion, accidents, weather, special events, and other costly delays. Whereas typical policy responses prioritize reduction of delays under normal conditions to improve the efficiency of <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>systems,</b> analytic support for investments that improve resilience (defined as system recovery from additional disruptions) is still scarce. In this effort, we represent paved roads as a transportation network by mapping intersections to nodes and road segments between the intersections to links. We built road networks for 40 of the urban areas defined by the U. S. Census Bureau. We developed and calibrated a model to evaluate traffic delays using link loads. The loads may be regarded as traffic-based centrality measures, estimating {{the number of individuals}} using corresponding road segments. Efficiency was estimated as the average annual delay per peak-period auto commuter, and modeled results were found to be close to observed data, with the notable exception of New York City. Resilience was estimated as the change in efficiency resulting from roadway disruptions and was found to vary between cities, with increased delays due to a 5 % random loss of road linkages ranging from 9. 5 % in Los Angeles to 56. 0 % in San Francisco. The results demonstrate that many <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>systems</b> that operate inefficiently under normal conditions are nevertheless resilient to disruption, whereas some more efficient cities are more fragile. The implication is that resilience, not just efficiency, should be considered explicitly in roadway project selection and justify investment opportunities related to disaster and other disruptions.

40|$|Incidents (vehicle breakdowns, crashes, roadworks, lane blockages, severe weather, etc.) are {{believed}} responsible for about 50 percent of traffic congestion in Australia's major cities, {{which is a}} similar situation to that found in cities in {{many other parts of}} the developed world. Incident-based congestion is particularly disruptive because of its random occurrence in space and time, which maximises the operational impacts of the congestion on social and economic activities. This paper discusses a method for assessing critical locations-congestion "hot spots"-in urban road networks, and the development and application of diagnostic tools that will allow <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>system</b> managers to anticipate potential vulnerabilities to incident-related congestion and take proactive action to avoid congestion rather than react to it. The expected outcomes are then reduced congestion, delays, and pollution; significantly improved performance from the existing urban road system; and reduced pressure to build more roads. The method involves modelling of travel demand, network topology, capacity and road geometry, the identification and assessment of impacts of traffic incidents at specific locations in a road network, and the use of accessibility impact analysis to assess system-wide effects. Accessibility impact analysis is undertaken using an accessibility framework, which can account for time of day, transport mode and destination choices by individuals, and level of traffic congestion among other factors. A case-study application to a specific (potential) incident in a real-world network indicates that the proposed method is feasible and demonstrates its power in identifying not just total impacts but the distribution of those impacts across a region or community. While current approaches to urban road network planning and management tend to be reactive-finding cures for problems as they arise or addressing locations of recurrent congestion or bad incident record-the vulnerability analysis method described in the paper should lend itself to a proactive approach that can anticipate structural weaknesses and vulnerabilities and help to avoid or at least temper potential adverse effects, rather than to react to them afterwards.

In this paper, we introduce a stochastic traffic model to capture the space and time dynamics of vehicles in signalized <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>systems</b> to identify poorly-connected regions for infrastructure node placements. To closely approximate the practical road conditions, we propose a density-dependent velocity profile to approximate vehicle interactions and capture platoons formation and dissipation at traffic signals. Numerical results are presented to evaluate the stochastic traffic model. In general, we show that the fluid model can adequately describe the mean behavior of the traffic stream, while the stochastic model can approximate the probability distribution well even when vehicles {{interact with each other}} as their movement is controlled by traffic lights.

40|$|Abstract—The {{space and}} time {{dynamics}} of moving vehicles regulated by traffic signals governs the node connectivity and communication capability of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) in urban environments. However, none of the previous studies on node connectivity has considered such dynamics {{with the presence of}} traffic lights and vehicle interactions. In fact, most of them assume that vehicles are distributed homogeneously throughout the geographic area, which is unrealistic. We introduce in this paper a stochastic traffic model for VANETs in signalized <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>systems.</b> The proposed model is a composite of the fluid model and stochastic model. The former characterizes the general flow and evolution of the traffic stream so that the average density of vehicles is readily computable, while the latter takes into account the random behavior of individual vehicles. As the key contribution of this paper, we attempt to approximate vehicle interactions and capture platoon formations and dissipations at traffic signals through a density-dependent velocity profile. The stochastic traffic model with approximation of vehicle interactions is evaluated with extensive simulations, and the distributional result of the model is validated against real-world empirical data in London. In general, we show that the fluid model can adequately describe the mean behavior of the traffic stream, while the stochastic model can approximate the probability distribution well even when vehicles interact with each other as their movement is controlled by traffic lights. With the knowledge of the mean vehicular density dynamics and its probability distribution from the stochastic traffic model, we determine the degree of connectivity in the communication network and illustrate that system engineering and planning for optimizing both the transport (in terms of congestion) and communication networks (in terms of connectivity) can be carried out with the proposed model.

40|$|Abstract — The {{efficient}} and reliable operation of material flows in transportation networks {{is a subject}} of broad eco-nomic interest. Important applications include the control of signalized intersections in <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>systems</b> and the planning and scheduling of logistic processes. Traditional approaches to operating material flow networks are however known to have severe disadvantages: centralized controllers suffer from their high computational demands that make an on-line control hardly possible in larger networks, whereas a decentralized control using clearing policies leads under rather general conditions to instabil-ities. As an alternative approach that may help to overcome these problems, a self-organization mechanism of conflicting flows is proposed that is inspired by oscillatory phenomena of pedestrian and animal flows at intersections or bottlenecks. For this purpose, a permeability function is introduced that allows to sequentially serve the different possible flow directions at an intersection in a fully demand-dependent way. The self-organized optimization achieved by the presented approach is demonstrated to be closely linked to synchronization of the oscillatory service dynamics at the different intersections in the network. For regular grid topologies, different synchroniza-tion regimes are present depending on the inertia of the switching from one service state to the next one. The dependence of this observation on the regularity of the considered network is tested. The reported results contribute to an improved understanding of the conditions {{that have to be}} present for efficiently operating material flow networks by a decentralized control, which is of major importance for future implementations in real-world traffic or production systems.

40|$|<b>Urban</b> <b>road</b> {{infrastructure}} management deals with complex decision making process. There {{are several reasons}} for a complexity such as: multi-disciplinarity, lots of participants, huge quantity of information, limited budget, conflict goals and criteria. These facts indicate that decision making processes in <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> {{infrastructure management}} belong to ill-defined problems. In order to cope with such complexity and to help managers during decision making processes this research proposes an application of multicriteria methods. Therefore, a generic concept of decision support for <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> infrastructure management based on multicriteria analysis is proposed. Three multicriteria methods: AHP, SAW and PROMETHHE, in a combination with 0 - 1 programming are used. The main advantage of an application of multicriteria analysis is that all stakeholders could be objectively included into decision process. Therefore, setting up of criteria weights involves opinions from all stakeholders’ groups (stakeholders are divided into three characteristic groups). Evaluation of criteria importance (weights) is based on three sets of opinions processed by Analytic Hierarchic Processing (AHP) method. Three sets of criteria are then processed by Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) method resulting in a final set of criteria weights. By using SAW method, relative importance of opinions of all three stakeholders’ groups is introduced. Collected data are then processed by PROMETHEE multicriteria methods.

The fundamental lack of integration between energy and transport policy obstructs measures to increase the use of renewable fuels and more energy-efficient vehicles, which in turn obstructs the reduction of CO 2 emissions from transport.

Then Netica was used to carry out posterior probability reasoning, the most probable explanation, and inferential analysis. The results showed that the Bayesian network model could effectively explore the complex logical relation in road accidents and express the uncertain relation among related variables. The model not only can quantitatively predict the probability of an accident in certain road traffic condition but also can find the key reasons and the most unfavorable state combination which leads to the occurrence of an accident. The results of the study can provide theoretical support for <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> management authorities to thoroughly analyse the induction factors of road accidents and then establish basis in improving the safety performance of the <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> traffic <b>system...</b>|$|R
40|$|A new {{cellular}} automaton (CA) model is proposed to simulate traffic dynamics in <b>urban</b> two-way <b>road</b> network <b>systems.</b> The NaSch rule is adopted to represent vehicle movements on road sections. Two novel rules are proposed {{to move the}} vehicles in intersection areas, and an additional rule is developed to avoid the “gridlock” phenomenon. Simulation {{results show that the}} network fundamental diagram is very similar to that of road traffic flow. We found that the randomization probability and the maximum vehicle speed have significant impact on network traffic mobility for free-flow state. Their effect may be weak when the network is congested...|$|R
40|$|Current {{advances}} in artificial intelligence are providing {{new opportunities for}} utilizing the enormous amount of data available in contemporary <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> surveillance <b>systems.</b> Several approaches, methodologies, and techniques have been presented for analyzing and forecasting traffic counts because such information {{has been identified as}} vital for the deployment of advanced transportation management and information systems. In this paper, a meta-analysis framework is presented for improving forecasted information of traffic counts, based on an adaptive data processing scheme. In particular, a framework for combining traffic count forecasts within a Mamdani-type fuzzy adaptive optimal control scheme is presented and analyzed. The proposed methodology treats the uncertainty pertaining to such circumstances by augmenting qualitative information of future traffic flow states (and values) with a knowledge base and a heuristic optimization routine that provides dynamic training capabilities, resulting in an efficient real-time forecasting mechanism. Results from the application of the proposed framework on data acquired from realistic signalized urban network data (of Athens, Greece) and for a diversity of locations exhibit its potential...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a gray system theory-based method for the quantitative evaluation and ranking of the operational and safety performance of signalized intersections {{in urban areas}} under mixed traffic conditions. Mixed traffic conditions refer to traffic situations in which motor vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians share a signalized intersection. Such mixed traffic is a typical phenomenon in many cities {{around the world in}} which the populations of urban areas are extremely large. Five index parameters are used in the proposed method: the degree of saturation, the average stopped delay, the queue length, the conflict ratio, and the separation ratio. These parameters represent the operational and safety performance of a signalized intersection with mixed traffic. They are inputted into the evaluation equations, which are developed according to the gray system theory. The method is applied to the performance evaluation of the intersections and network in the urban area of Changsha, China. the results show that the method can be used to conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation and ranking of signalized intersections under the mixed traffic conditions that are associated with <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> network <b>systems.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
