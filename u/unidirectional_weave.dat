This thesis examined {{the effectiveness of}} chopped strand mat (CSM) plug repairs of glass fiber / vinyl ester woven roving laminates subjected to in-plane shear and bending. An advantage {{of this type of}} repair scheme is its simplicity when compared to more traditional schemes such as scarf or step repairs. The stress concentrations around circular holes in glass fiber / vinyl ester woven roving laminates subjected to in-plane shear and bending were calculated before and after repairs using CSM plugs, also of glass fiber / vinyl ester, having varying fiber volume fractions. The laminates were orthotropic and ranged from balanced to <b>unidirectional</b> <b>woven</b> roving, and the CSM plug fiber volume fractions ranged from 0 to 0. 40. For in-plane shear stress, as the plug fiber volume fraction increased from 0 to 0. 40, the maximum stress concentration along the circular holes in the laminate was reduced from about 25 % to 61 %.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{and discuss the}} {{methodology}} to monitor average residual stresses in aged high temperature <b>unidirectional</b> and <b>woven</b> graphite fiber/PMR- 15 composites. The aging experiments were performed at 315 °C for 1170 h in nitrogen and 1064 h in air, respectively. The proposed methodology was based on X-ray diffraction (XRD) strain measurements in embedded crystalline metallic inclusions. The aging experiments performed in nitrogen showed an increasing trend in the measured residual stresses from the embedded inclusions with aging time. In contrast, the aging experiments performed in air showed an increasing trend up to ∼ 200 h and then dropped by ∼ 40 % for both <b>unidirectional</b> and <b>woven</b> composites. To extract the average stresses in the composite matrix from the average stresses in embedded inclusions as determined using XRD, the well-established Eshelby/Mori-Tanaka method was used. In addition, to address the effect of inclusion interactions, we also computed the average stresses in the embedded inclusions by taking into account inclusion interactions within the frame-work of the Eshelby/Mori-Tanaka method. It was shown that the interactions between the inclusions did not significantly disturb the average stresses in the inclusions, thereby validating the Eshelby/Mori-Tanaka method used in our analysis. Finally, we show that for an aging process that does not cause any damage to a composite matrix, a relatively simple computation based on the visco-elastic Eshelby/Mori-Tanaka method is sufficient to determine the average stress field in a composite matrix {{as compared with the}} predictions based on classical lamination plate theory (CLPT).

The considered composite materials exhibit a hierarchical material structure with three distinct length scales - micro, meso and macro.

The heterogeneous material structure in an RVE is modelled by the extended finite element method (XFEM) Suitable material models account for the deformation behaviour of the constituents in the generated RVE models. The combination of XFEM and a cohesive zone model is used to represent discrete failure processes in the local material structure. This multiscale approach is applied to predict the effective material behaviour of fibre reinforced polymers.

40|$|Advanced {{composite}} materials, particularly carbon fibre-reinforced epoxies, {{are used}} {{extensively in the}} construction of contemporary Formula One racing cars because of their high specific stiffness and strength properties. The present Chapter is concerned with one significant load-bearing component, namely the suspension push-rod.

Both uniform and tapered layups of <b>unidirectional</b> and <b>woven</b> cross-ply prepreg have been used to manufacture pushrods of aerofoil cross-sections. These structural components have been loaded to catastrophic failure and the identified damage mechanisms were seen to includefibre micro buckling, fibre kinking and fibre fracture. A comparison has been made between the actual and theoretically predicted failure strains and it is seen that buckling was the ultimate cause of failure in all cases.

The nanofibers were produced directly {{on the surface of}} carbon fabrics by a needleless electrospinning method, and composites were then prepared by vacuum-assisted impregnation. Interlaminar shear stress tests, three-point bending, Charpy-impact and instrumented falling weight tests were carried out. The fracture surfaces were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. Due to the nano-sized reinforcements, the interlaminar shear strength of the <b>woven</b> and <b>unidirectional</b> fiber-reinforced composites was enhanced by 7 and 11 %, respectively.

The Charpy impact tests indicated that the nanofiber interleaves also led to {{a significant increase in the}} initiation and total break energies. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the presence of nanofibers can effectively increase the impact properties of composites without compromising their in-plane properties because the thickness of the composites was not altered by the presence of interleaves.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Few {{comprehensive}} {{studies on}} the effects of stacking sequence and rein-forcement form (<b>unidirectional</b> versus <b>woven)</b> have been published to date and much of the available data is contradictory. In the present study, instrumented impact tests were used to characterize such effects for carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic toughened epoxy laminates. Impact resistance was characterized in terms of load and energy parameters measured during penetration tests. These parameters were related to damage in the lami-nates by conducting rebound tests followed by ultrasonic imaging and microscopy. The results clearly demonstrated a relationship between the onset of damage and the first peak in the load versus deflection plots obtained in the penetration tests. No major effects of stacking sequence or reinforcement form were apparent in terms of the energy required for the onset of damage in the laminates. Energy to maximum load was found to be highly de-pendent on stacking sequence. Substitution of <b>woven</b> reinforcement for <b>unidirectional</b> tape in a quasi-isotropic layup resulted in a substantial decrease in the energy to maximum load. The results in terms of peak load showed similar trends. No effects of stacking se-quence or reinforcement form were observed in terms of energy after peak load.
