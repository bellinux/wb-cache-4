25|$|Nevertheless, some modern {{experiments}} {{between the}} relationship of number of mates and the reproductive success {{of males and females}} support Bateman's Principle. Julie Collet conducted an experiment with a population of red jungle fowl. A total of thirteen replicate groups of three males and four females were monitored for ten days. In this experiment, the sex ratio was biased toward females. A male's reproductive success was calculated using the proportion of embryos fathered to the total number of embryos produced by all the females he mated with. The total sexual selection opportunity was calculated <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> formula.|$|E
