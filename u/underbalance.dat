This paper presents the effect of natural clay in formulating nontraditional completion fluid to ensure successful perforation job and increase of production rate. Natural clay is used as homogenizing agent to create a stable and non-damaging low-density completion fluid.

In non-permeable rock, the rock crushing efficiency, the penetration rate and the concentrated force of well trend to increase, the well trends to inclination.

In practice {{it is found that}} <b>underbalance</b> conditions clean up the damaged zone to some extent, however, the mechanisms of these processes are poorly understood. Most hydrocodes typically used to simulate rock response to shaped charge penetration do not provide permeability estimates. Furthermore, the time scales for formation clean up are potentially much longer than the period of jet penetration. We have developed a simple, yet accurate model for the evolution of porosity and permeability which can easily be incorporated into existing hydrocodes using information from the history of each cell. In addition, we have developed a code that efficiently simulates fines migration during the post-shot surge period using initial conditions taken directly from hydrocode simulations of jet penetration. Results from a one-dimensional model simulation are in excellent agreement with measured fines and permeability distributions. We also present two-dimensional numerical results which qualitatively reproduce experimentally obtained permeability maps for different values of <b>underbalance.</b> Although initial results have been promising, further comparison with experiment is essential to tune the coupling between the hydrocode and fines migration simulator.

40|$|Cement {{operations}} in narrow pressure windows can be challenging, {{due to the}} increased hydrostatic pressure caused by heavy-weight cement. Through managed pressure control, downhole pressure fluctuations can be controlled, maintaining a relatively constant annulus pressure profile during the entire operation. Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) has successfully been applied in several wells {{around the world to}} accurately control the annular downhole pressure during drilling. In this thesis, the advantages of applying MPD techniques while cementing, commonly known as Managed Pressure Cementing (MPC), are investigated. The flow and pressure dynamics throughout the entire cement operation are described by a simple hydraulic model. A Proportional-Integral (PI) controller is implemented to control the down hole pressure fluctuations. The MPC techniques presented in this thesis include an Applied Back-Pressure (ABP) system and a Dual Gradient (DG) system. In the ABP system, the bottom hole pressure is managed through regulation of a topside choke valve. In the DG system, a subsea pump module is used to manage the bottom hole pressure by altering the riser level. The MPC models are simulated in MATLAB to demonstrate how MPC can improve conventional cement operations. Based on the results, the ABP system was superior to the DG system in compensating for annular downhole pressure fluctuations. The choke regulations in the closed ABP system gave a faster pressure response in the well, compared to the open DG system altering the riser level. However, since the ABP system is constantly in <b>underbalance,</b> the consequence of equipment failure can be severe. Compared to a conventional cement job, MPC provides increased pressure control, allows for higher displacement rates and the cement/spacer to be tailored outside of traditional pressure limits. Hence, successful MPC operations are associated with reduced risk, increased efficiency and improved cement jobs...|$|E

In a plot study, located in central Sweden, eight different treatments were; conventional autumn plowing, spring plowing with and without catch crop, no tillage, deep cultivation (40 cm), direct drilling, ley alternating with autumn wheat, and addition of organic material. The two spring-plowed treatments had the lowest losses of total phosphorous; the catch crop did not develop sufficiently to affect the losses. The largest losses were from the autumn-plowed and the deep-cultivated plots, beeing almost twice those of the spring-plowed plots. The loss of phosphate-phosphorous were largest from the direct-drilled plot, where it contributed {{with half of the}} loss, compared to 10 - 20 % in the other treatments. The treatments that gave the best ratio between phosphorous loss and harvest were the two spring-plowed plots and the one with addition of organic matter. [...] - As a part of nation-wide monitoring of the impact of agriculture on the aquatic system, total and dissolved phosphorus (P) transport was measured from eleven subsurface drained fields in Sweden between 1977 - 1998. The P leaching revealed marked spatial variation depending on soil type, P soil status and other factors. Notably leaching from three of the fields together accounted for another 19 %, while leaching from the other four fields was more or less negligible. During the investigation period a surplus of P added to the soil during the initial years was transformed to a slight <b>underbalance</b> of P. Leaching from most fields was found to be relatively constant, but two fields with highest P losses showed increasing trend during the 1970 and 1980. On average 0, 4 kg/ha and year leached from all fields during the entire period. This figure may have been an underestimation, especially on clay soils, depending on the sampling technique. [...] A database was set up covering analysis of pesticides in surface water and groundwater during the period January 1985 to June 1999. The data were obtained from more than 4000 water samples collected primarly by Swedish municipalities. Many of these samples were taken because either problems were expected, or pesticides had been detected earlier at the particular site. Pesticides were found in drinking water from 15 municipalities. The most frequently occurring pesticide found in drinking water was a metabolite from the herbicide dichlobenil; i. e. 2, 6 -dichlorobenzamide (abbreviated BAM). The greatest number of water localities containing pesticides was found in Skåne, the county with the highest number of investigations but also the county with the most intensive use of pesticides. The substances most often detected in surface water, apart from BAM were MCPA, atrazine, dichlorprop and mecoprop, and the median concentrations of detection were in the range 0. 1 - 0. 3 µg/l.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{technique}} used worldwide while drilling {{is known as}} overbalanced drilling. Which {{is defined as the}} drilling process where the hydrostatic pressure used exceeds the formation pressure. This is done with the main purpose of “killing ” the well. However, there are numerous problems that accompany overbalanced drilling. Such problems are differential pipe sticking, loss of circulation, formation damage and other problems. A relatively new technique was introduced, known as <b>underbalanced</b> drilling, where the well is being drilled with a hydrostatic pressure less than that of the formation. Correct and proper execution of such technique eliminates problems associated with overbalanced drilling. More precisely, <b>underbalanced</b> drilling solves the issues of formation damage, differential pressure sticking and loss of circulation. Additionally, <b>underbalanced</b> drilling increases the rate of penetration and provides other uses discussed in this paper. On the other hand, <b>underbalanced</b> drilling has its own problems as well. The objective of this paper was divided into three steps; the first step involves collecting and filtering the data required for comparing between overbalanced and <b>underbalanced</b> drilling using the drilling simulator.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experimental investigation of formation damage in a fractured carbonate core sample under <b>underbalanced</b> drilling (UBD) conditions. A {{major portion of}} this study has concentrated on problems which are often associated with UBD {{and the development of}} a detailed protocol for proper design and execution of an UBD program. Formation damage effects, which may occur even if the <b>underbalanced</b> pressure condition is maintained 100 % of the time during drilling operation, have been studied. One major concern for formation damage during UBD operations is the loss of the <b>underbalanced</b> pressure condition. Hence, it becomes vital to evaluate the sensitivity of the formation to the effect of an overbalanced pulse situation. The paper investigates the effect of short pulse overbalance pressure during <b>underbalanced</b> conditions in a fractured chalk core sample. Special core tests using a specially designed core holder are conducted on the subject reservoir core. Both overbalance and <b>underbalanced</b> tests were conducted with four UBD drilling fluids. Core testing includes measurements of the initial permeability and return permeability under two different pressure conditions (<b>underbalanced</b> and overbalanced). Then the procedure is followed by applying a differential pressure on the core samples to mimic the drawdown effect to determine the return permeability capacity. In both UBD and short pulse OBP four mud formulations are used which are: lab oil, brine (3 % KCL), water-based mud (bentonite with XC polymer) and fresh water. The return permeability measurements show that a lab oil system performed fairly well during UBD and short OB conditions. The results indicate that a short overbalance pressure provides a significant reduction in permeability of the fractured formations. In most tests, even application of a high drawdown pressure during production cannot restore the initial permeability by more than 40 %.
