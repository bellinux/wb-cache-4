5|$|COBOL 2002 {{suffered}} from poor support: no compilers completely supported the standard. Micro Focus {{found that it}} was {{due to a lack of}} user demand for the new features and due to the abolition of the NIST test suite, which had been <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>test</b> compiler conformance. The standardization process was also found to be slow and under-resourced.|$|E

5|$|The Chelmscombe Quarry {{finished}} {{its work}} as a limestone quarry in the 1950s and was then used by the Central Electricity Generating Board as a tower testing station.

5|$|A new mineral venture was {{attempted}} in 1907, {{for which}} {{much of the}} line was re-opened and a -gauge extension was added, but this failed and the line closed again in 1910. A section of the track was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>test</b> and demonstrate an automatic signal warning device in 1911 and occasionally used in that connection up to 1914. The tracks were lifted for scrap in 1917, after which a light railway was laid on part of the trackbed in 1918 to carry timber. This ended in 1920 and the company was wound up in 1925.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} tests that can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>test</b> the {{function}} of the thyroid, for the presence of diseases, and for {{the success or failure of}} treatment. Blood tests in general aim to measure thyroid function or determine the cause of thyroid dysfunction. Thyroid function tests include a battery of blood tests including the measurement of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4, as well as the measurement of TSH. They may reveal hyperthyroidism (high T3 and T4), hypothyroidism (low T3, T4), or subclinical hyperthyroidism (normal T3 and T4 with a low TSH).|$|E
5|$|Besides the Tu-142's {{military}} applications, a one-off Tu-142MP was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>test</b> a new ASW suite. Another Tu-142 {{was converted}} {{to replace the}} Tu-95LL for the testing of turbojet engines. Designated Tu-142LL, the ASW equipment and armament were removed to allow an engine test bed to be carried under the belly. Some of the engines installed were the NK-25 for the Tu-22MZ, RD36-51A for the Tu-144D, and the NK-32 for the Tu-160. The first Tu-142MK was converted for an airborne laboratory role, setting several altitude-in-horizontal and time-to-altitude records in its class.|$|E
5|$|Construction at the {{two sites}} started between 1962 and 1963 with {{improvements}} in the TsSO-P test model being fed back into the deployed units.

The radar systems were completed in late 1966 with the fourth Dnestr at Balkhash being used for testing.

5|$|Humans are {{not alone}} in {{suffering}} from lead's effects; plants and animals are also affected by lead toxicity to varying degrees depending on species. Animals experience many of the same effects of lead exposure as humans do, such as abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, and behavioral changes such as increased aggression. Much of what is known about human lead toxicity and its effects is derived from animal studies. Animals are <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>test</b> the effects of treatments, such as chelating agents, and to provide information on the pathophysiology of lead, such as how it is absorbed and distributed in the body.|$|E
5|$|In the past, Native Americans ate {{the flesh}} of {{horseshoe}} crabs, and used the tail spines as spear tips and the shells to bail water out of their canoes. More recent attempts to use horseshoe crabs as food for livestock were abandoned when {{it was found that}} this gave the meat a bad taste. Horseshoe crab blood contains a clotting agent, limulus amebocyte lysate, which is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>test</b> antibiotics and kidney machines to ensure that they are free of dangerous bacteria, and to detect spinal meningitis and some cancers.|$|E
