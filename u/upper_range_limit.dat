40|$|Aim: In subalpine and alpine environments, range {{shifts of}} species to higher altitudes are {{predicted}} {{to occur in}} response to reductions in the snow cover from climate change. However, the distribution of key resources may constrain the range of animal populations and prevent any upward migration. This study examined the local resource constraints on the <b>upper</b> <b>range</b> <b>limit</b> of a large, native herbivore in Australia, the common wombat Vombatus ursinus. Location: The subalpine zone of the Snowy Mountains, Australia. Methods: Logistic regression analyses of snow and habitat predictors were conducted on the presence/absence of wombat signs recorded along an altitudinal gradient during winter and summer, using parametric and nonparametric methods. Results: Wombats responded strongly to the altitudinal gradient, but snow cover alone did not fully explain their <b>upper</b> <b>range</b> <b>limit.</b> Wombat occurrence in the subalpine zone was influenced by local habitat features in combination with maximum snow depth. More rugged, high-relief terrain was important to wombats in winter, allowing individuals access to {{a wider range of}} altitudes, snow depths and shelter sites. During summer, high soil bulk density was an important predictor of occurrence, and in both seasons, occurrence declined in response to a higher cover of burnt grass. Main conclusions: These models demonstrate that local habitat factors play a role even where there are strong regulating environmental factors. For wombats, this may limit future range expansion into the alpine zone despite the potential for an increase in abundance at their present range limit. These findings show the need for local ecological studies to be conducted in parallel with broad scale climate modelling if we are to understand shifts in species distributions as the climate rapidly changes...|$|E
3000|$|Light {{scattering}} by particles {{comparable with}} wavelength {{is determined by}} the ratio of particle radius r to the wavelength λ of the incident radiation, which {{is referred to as the}} size parameter (e.g., Bohren and Huffman, 1983). The size parameter is denoted by x and expressed as: x = 2 πr/λ. However, in the case of irregularly-shaped particles, the meaning of radius needs to be specified. We attribute the radius r to a sphere circumscribing a target particle. Note that, if necessary, the size parameter x referring to the circumscribing sphere can be easily transformed to the size parameter of equal-volume sphere xeq through the packing density ρ as follows: xeq = ρ 1 / 3 x. Through this study, the size parameter x is varied from 1 to 26 (in the case of m = 1.6 + 0.0005 i [...]), 28 (m = 1.6 + 0.02 i), and 32 (m = 1.6 + 0.1 i). The difference in the <b>upper</b> <b>range</b> <b>limit</b> of x is caused by limitations in the DDA convergence. At wavelength λ = 0.67 µm, the range of x corresponds to particle radii from 0.1 µm to 2.8, 3, and 3.4 µm, respectively.|$|E
40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that invasive species are threating montane ecosystems globally. However, trends in species distribution {{are difficult to}} observe directly {{due to a lack}} of data with suitable spatio-temporal resolution. Here, we aimed to detect spatio-temporal trends in exotic plants in a montane ecosystem, and to determine which drivers had a role affecting these trends. Each year, for a period of seven years, we recorded the <b>upper</b> elevational <b>range</b> <b>limit</b> of exotic plant species in road verges along an elevational gradient of 1, 500 – 2, 874 m a. s. l. in southern Africa. We fitted repeated-measures ANOVA models to test if <b>upper</b> elevational <b>range</b> <b>limits</b> changed over time. Generalized least squares models showed that exotic richness of annuals increased by 3. 9 species per year. Also, the <b>upper</b> elevational <b>range</b> <b>limits</b> of established exotics ascended by 24. 5 m/y for annuals (N = 17 species), and by 9. 7 m/y for perennials (N = 26). These upward trends were too rapid to be explained by slow-acting drivers such as climatic change or time since species introduction. The rates of increase indicate that many exotics were not yet in equilibrium with the environment and, therefore, had not been in the region long enough to have filled their potential niches. Exotic species could reach much higher elevations than expected, indicating that current prediction models are likely an underestimation of potential distributional ranges. The spatial clustering of <b>upper</b> elevational <b>range</b> <b>limits</b> around potential points of introduction indicates ongoing human-mediated propagule pressure as the major cause of rapid exotic range expansion, especially along roads and near dwellings. Montane road verges are regularly disturbed by erosion and maintenance, creating unoccupied habitats, while traffic in the form of vehicles and tourists facilitates the introduction of new species. This suggests that easily accessible montane ecosystems are much more susceptible to invasions than previously assumed, due to a combination of anthropogenic disturbance and ongoing propagule pressure.

Here, we investigate changes in the elevational distribution of dung beetle species (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidea) in two separate mountain regions in Europe. Location: South-western Alps (France) and Sierra Nevada (Spain). Methods: We compared historical and current data on dung beetle distributions along elevation gradients for 30 species in the SW Alps and 19 species in the Sierra Nevada. We tested for significant changes between survey periods in three parameters: mean elevation and <b>upper</b> and lower <b>range</b> <b>limits.</b> Results: We found up-slope range shifts for 63 % and 90 % of the species in the SW Alps and Sierra Nevada, respectively. Up-slope range shifts resulted mainly from expansion of <b>upper</b> <b>range</b> <b>limits</b> in the SW Alps and from changes of both <b>range</b> <b>limits</b> in the Sierra Nevada. The magnitudes of range shifts {{were consistent with the}} level of warming experienced in each region, but they also reflected the asymmetrical warming observed along the elevation gradients. Smaller changes were observed for species reaching their historical <b>range</b> <b>limits</b> at the higher elevations, associated with a non-significant increase in temperature between periods. Main conclusions: The differences observed between regions are related to the geographical position of each mountain range, which determines the characteristics (including thermal tolerance) of the regional species pool, and the level of warming, which determines whether maximum thermal tolerance has been exceeded for the majority of species in the region.

The response of thyroid-stimulating hormone to thyrotrophin-releasing hormone was measured in 25 patients from this subgroup. Results were compared with those from 53 control subjects. Primary hypothyroidism, defined by a raised thyroid-stimulating hormone level above the <b>upper</b> <b>range</b> <b>limit</b> of 6 · 5 μIU/ml of the controls, was present in 17 · 5 % of the 114 patients. In group 2 patients, a spectrum of thyroid disease spanning uncompensated and compensated primary hypothyroidism and decreased thyroid reserve was evident.

40|$|Reactor safety {{experiments}} {{for studying}} the reactions of a molten core (corium) with water and/or concrete involve materials at extremely high temperature. Such high temperature severely restricts the types of sensors that can be employed to measure characteristics of the corium itself. Yet there is great interest in improving instrumentation so {{that the state of}} the melt can be established with more precision. In particular, it would be beneficial to increase both the <b>upper</b> <b>range</b> <b>limit</b> and accuracy of temperature measurements. The poor durability of thermocouples at high temperature is also an important issue. For experiments involving a water-quenched melt, direct measurements of the growth rate of the crust separating the melt and water would be of great interest. This is a key element in determining the nature of heat transfer between the melt and coolant. Despite its importance, no one has been able to directly measure the crust thickness during such tests. This paper considers three specialized sensors that could be introduced to enhance melt characterization: (1) A commercially fabricated, single point infrared temperature measurement with the footprint of a thermowell. A lens assembly and fiber optic cable linked to a receiver and amplifier measures the temperature {{at the base of a}} tungsten thermowell. The <b>upper</b> <b>range</b> <b>limit</b> is 3000 C and accuracy is {+-} 0. 25 % of the reading. (2) In-house development of an ultrasonic temperature sensor that would provide multipoint measurements at temperatures up to {approx} 3000 C. The sensors are constructed from tungsten rods and have a high temperature durability that is superior to that of thermocouples. (3) In-house development of an ultrasonic probe to measure the growth rate of the corium crust. This ultrasonic sensor would include a tungsten waveguide that transmits ultrasonic pulses up through the corium melt towards the crust and detects reflections from the melt/crust interface. A measurement of the echo time delay would provide the location of the interface. These three sensors would provide a considerable upgrade of the instrumentation used in our reactor materials tests. The infracouple is a commercial product that could provide an immediate improvement in temperature measurements. The sensor could also serve to corroborate thermocouple data by providing a measurement based upon a different physical principle. The ultrasonic temperature sensor would involve a greater investment and longer time frame than the infracouple, but offers all the advantages of the infracouple along with miniaturization and the ability to measure at multiple locations. In addition, the UTS is the platform from which we would begin development of the crust detector. Of the three sensors, the crust detector requires the most effort and entails the greatest uncertainty. However, a real-time crust thickness measurement has never before been made and such data would be unique and of great benefit to reactor materials experiments...|$|E

Two different upper limits for percent random analytical error are suggest-ed, based on the medical application of the test and the statistical properties of various amounts of error. When the purpose of the test is to distinguish an upper medi-cally defined limit from a lower medically defined limit, a maximum random error equivalent to 60 % of the dif-ference between the limits is proposed.

However, we are only starting to understand the power and limitations of this technology. To determine the applicability of PDMS microchannels for blood flow analysis, we studied white blood cell (WBC) margination in channels of various geometries and blood compositions. We found that WBCs prefer to marginate downstream of sudden expansions, and that red blood cell (RBC) aggregation facilitates the process. In contrast to tubes, WBC margination was restricted to the sidewalls in our low aspect ratio, pseudo- 2 D rectangular channels and consequently, margination efficiencies of more than 95 % were achieved in a variety of channel geometries. In these pseudo- 2 D channels blood rheology and cell integrity were preserved over a range of flow rates, with the <b>upper</b> <b>range</b> <b>limited</b> by the shear in the vertical direction.

40|$|The {{spread of}} {{invasive}} plants along elevational gradients {{is considered a}} threat to fragile mountain ecosystems, {{but it can also}} provide the opportunity to better understand some of the basic processes driving the success of invasive species. Ageratina adenophora (Asteraceae) is an invasive plant of global importance and has a broad distribution along elevational gradients in the Western Himalayas. Our study aimed at understanding the role of evolutionary processes (e. g. local adaptation and clinal differentiation) and different life history stages in shaping the distribution pattern of the invasive plant along an elevational gradient in the Western Himalaya. We carried out extensive distributional surveys, established a reciprocal transplant experiment with common gardens at three elevational levels, and measured a suite of traits related to germination, growth, reproduction and phenology. Our results showed a lack of local adaptation, and we did not find any evidence for clinal differentiation in any measured trait except a rather weak signal for plant height. We found that seed germination was the crucial life-cycle transition in determining the lower range limit while winter mortality of plants shaped the <b>upper</b> <b>range</b> <b>limit</b> in our study area, thus explaining the hump shaped distribution pattern. Differences in trait values between gardens for most traits indicated a high degree of phenotypic plasticity. Possible causes such as apomixis, seed dispersal among sites, and pre-adaptation might have confounded evolutionary processes to act upon.

40|$|BNFL Instruments ' TRU-D Portable Package monitor (PPM) was {{developed}} {{in response to a}} market need for a simple, highly maneuverable, accurate, reliable and inexpensive packet monitor. The instrument plays a major role at nuclear sites in performing a wide variety of plutonium measurement tasks, but is primarily being used as a portable instrument for criticality safety measurements of the fissile content of waste packages at the point of origin. Traditional packet monitoring methods used in operations and decommissioning have relied on methods such as gross gamma counting, which are subject to considerable variation, due to differences in the attenuation properties of waste matrix and source. The TRU-D Portable Package Monitor uses the total neutron counting method, which is far less sensitive to such biases. The system has been designed for rapid set-up and simple push button operation and can accept packages up to 30 cm in diameter and 50 cm in length with a maximum weight of 25 kg. The minimum detectable activity (MDA) is of the order of 0. 1 - 1 g Pu for a 10 minute measurement. Total measurement uncertainty (TMU) is typically less than +/- 40 % at the 95 % confidence level. Three applications are described in this paper, which demonstrate the versatility of this instrument. At nuclear sites in the United Kingdom, more than a dozen PPMs have been deployed in various waste management applications including provision of a “Threshold ” indication of Pu content for criticality safety control.

40|$|Aim In {{recent decades}} species ranges have shifted upwards in {{elevation}} and northwards in latitude. These shifts are commonly {{interpreted as a}} response to recent climate warming. However, several alternative hypotheses have been proposed to explain the elevational shifts, including increased deposition of atmospheric nitrogen, changes in precipitation and dispersal limitation. We evaluate these hypotheses and attempt to identify the dominant drivers for the observed shifts in the upper range limits of alpine plant species. Location European mountains from Svalbard to the southern Alps. Methods We assembled data on observed shifts in the <b>upper</b> <b>range</b> <b>limit</b> of alpine plants over 40 to 100 years on 114 mountains. We related the observed shifts to recent changes in temperature and precipitation and to recent deposition of atmospheric nitrogen. Changes in traits and habitat preferences of species in the summit assemblages were used to evaluate the potential role of different drivers. Results Seventy per cent of the species that showed a detectable change in their upper range limits between surveys shifted their range limits upwards. The same species tend to move up on different mountains. There are, however, large differences between mountains in the proportion of species shifting upwards. This proportion is not found to be statistically related to local changes in temperature. Correspondingly, warmth-demanding species did not move upward more frequently than expected by chance. Snow-bed species have become more common on summits. Main conclusions Our data do not support the idea that climate warming is the dominant factor causing the observed range shifts of alpine plant species on European mountains: first, the amount of change in species assemblages on the summits studied is not related statistically to the amount of climate warming; second, those species that have moved upwards are not particularly warmth demanding. </p...|$|E

[...] University of Washington, 2013 What factors {{determine}} where species occur, known as their geographic <b>range</b> <b>limits?</b> This classic ecological question has fascinated scientists for centuries, and {{is even more}} relevant today, {{in the face of}} anthropogenic climate change. Unfortunately, despite decades of research, we still lack a full understanding of the ecological processes driving <b>range</b> <b>limits.</b> Of particular interest, given forecasted global warming, {{is the extent to which}} climate determines species' <b>range</b> <b>limits.</b> If climate is important in controlling species' <b>range</b> <b>limits,</b> then <b>ranges</b> will likely shift up in elevation, as temperatures rise. This research examined how climatic factors, including temperature and precipitation, interact with biotic factors (specifically, competition between plants) to determine the distributions of common conifers on Mt. Rainier. I conducted observational studies of adult and sapling tree rings, as well as an experiment, in which seeds and seedlings were transplanted across species' altitudinal ranges and beyond their <b>range</b> <b>limits,</b> into different competitive environments. Taken together, my studies suggest that climate limits growth and survival at high elevations, while competition is more important at low elevations. These results support a classic, but little tested, hypothesis: biotic factors, such as competition, are more important at lower <b>range</b> <b>limits,</b> while abiotic factors, such as temperature, control <b>upper</b> <b>range</b> <b>limits.</b> Furthermore, these results suggest that climate change will lead to increased tree growth and upward expansion of Mt.

Climate change will likely have less dramatic effects at low elevations, where climate does not appear to strongly limit growth and survival of focal tree species, but competitive dynamics between plants do limit growth and survival. More experimental studies of other biotic interactions, diverse species, and widespread locations are necessary to better understand effects of climate change, and to prioritize conservation and natural resource management efforts...|$|R

40|$|Aim To {{investigate}} altitudinal range {{shifts of}} bryophytes in Switzerland by comparing recent altitudinal distributions with historical distributions derived from herbarium specimens. Location Switzerland, covering 41, 285 km 2 in Central Europe. Methods We used a dataset of 8520 herbarium specimens of 61 bryophyte species and compared altitudinal data {{between the two}} periods 1880 – 1920 and 1980 – 2005. The records we used were not specifically sampled for climatological analyses, but originate from non-systematic fieldwork by various collectors. Historical and recent records were distributed all over Switzerland with occurrences in all major biogeographical areas. To account for different sampling efforts in the two time periods, different subsampling procedures were applied. Results Overall, we found a significant mean increase in altitude of 89 ± 29 m which was mainly driven by the cryophilous species (+ 222 ± 50 m). The mean increase in altitude of cryophilous species corresponds to a decadal upward shift of 24 m. The <b>upper</b> <b>range</b> <b>limit</b> of cryophilous species also increased by 189 ± 55 m, {{but there was no}} effect on the lower range limit. For intermediate and thermophilous species neither mean, nor upper or lower range limits changed. However, the proportion of records of thermophilous to cryophilous species increased considerably at lower altitudes, but levelled off above approximately 1800 m. Main conclusions We conclude that cryophilous bryophytes are expanding their range to higher elevations in Switzerland and that at lower elevations, a slow extinction process is going on, probably as a result of climate warming trends. The observed decadal upward shifts of cryophilous species closely match those reported from vascular plants in Europe and those expected, given recent estimates of climate warming trends.

We validated a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay to detect and/or quantify 38 medications across a broad range of chronic diseases to obtain a comprehensive survey of patient adherence, medical record accuracy, and exposure variability in two patient populations. In a retrospectively tested 821 -patient cohort representing U. S. adults, we found that 46 % of medications assessed were detected in patients as prescribed in the medical record. Of the remaining medications, 23 % were detected, but not listed in the medical record while 30 % were prescribed to patients, but not detected in blood. To determine how often each detected medication fell within literature-derived reference ranges when taken as prescribed, we prospectively enrolled a cohort of 151 treatment-regimen adherent patients. In this cohort, we found that 53 % of medications that were taken as prescribed, as determined using patient self-reporting, were not within the blood reference range.

40|$|Theory on {{plasticity}} driving speciation, {{as applied}} to insect–plant interactions (the oscillation hypothesis), predicts more species in clades with higher diversity of host use, all else being equal. Previous support comes mainly from specialized herbivores such as butterflies, and plasticity theory suggests {{that there may be}} an <b>upper</b> host <b>range</b> <b>limit</b> where host diversity no longer promotes diversification. The tussock moths (Erebidae: Lymantriinae) are known for extreme levels of polyphagy. We demonstrate that this system is also very different from butterflies in terms of phylogenetic signal for polyphagy and for use of specific host orders. Yet we found support for the generality of the oscillation hypothesis, in that clades with higher diversity of host use were found to contain more species. These clades also consistently contained the most polyphagous single species. Comparing host use in Lymantriinae with related taxa shows that the taxon indeed stands out in terms of the frequency of polyphagous species. Comparative evidence suggests that this is most probably due to its nonfeeding adults, with polyphagy being part of a resulting life history syndrome. Our results indicate that even high levels of plasticity can drive diversification, at least when the levels oscillate over time...|$|R

40|$|We {{searched for}} {{coherent}} X-ray pulsations from Aql X- 1 {{in a series}} of RXTE observations taken shortly after a recent outburst. During the course of these observations, Aql X- 1 passes through an apparent "propeller" phase as its luminosity fades to its quiescent value. No pulsations were detected, and we place <b>upper</b> <b>limits</b> (<b>ranging</b> from 0. 52 % to 9. 0 %) on the fractional rms amplitude of any periodic signal contained in the various data sets searched. This result has implications for the geometry of the system, if the quiescent luminosity is due to continued low-level accretion. Alternatively, our result supports the idea that the quiescent luminosity may be due to thermal emission...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} of occurrence of abnormal, three- (or more) needle dwarf shoots of most southern and central European two-needle pine (Pinus) species were studied. No specimens with more than two-needle dwarf shoots were found in a population of P. nigra Arnold subsp. salzmannii (Dunal) Franco from the Iberian Peninsula and in two populations of P. uliginosa Neumann from the Sudeten Mountains in Central Europe. Single specimens were found within one population of P. pinaster Aiton from the Iberian Peninsula and among six populations of P. sylvestris L. from the Iberian Peninsula and Central Europe. Abnormal dwarf shoots mostly with three, but also four, five or six needles were found among 24 of 25 surveyed populations of P. mugo Turra and P. uncinata Ramond. The average {{frequency of}} specimens {{with at least one}} three-needle dwarf shoot was 24 % for P. mugo and 20 % for P. uncinata. The frequencies of occurrence varied significantly among studied populations and were highest in samples collected from the <b>upper</b> elevational <b>range</b> <b>limits</b> of the species in the mountains and near the northern <b>limits</b> of their <b>ranges.</b> The frequency of abnormal dwarf shoots in the same populations was significantly high in 2 - 3 consecutive years. Needles from three-needle dwarf shoots were not significantly shorter than those of two-needle shoots...|$|R
40|$|A species’ climate niche {{summarizes}} the observed climatic conditions at its <b>range</b> <b>limits.</b> This {{information can be}} used to predict range shifts of species under climate change, but it does not explain why they occur under a given climate or are absent from another. Functional traits associated with the climate niche, however, allow for such an explanation. We show that key plant functional traits predict the climate ranges of North American trees and discuss the underlying filter mechanisms that define “no-go areas” for specific trait expressions. This approach replaces species idiosyncrasy by the generality of traits, puts biogeography on more functional grounds, and yields products that will serve the improvement of next generation global vegetation models. Using functional traits to explain species’ <b>range</b> <b>limits</b> is a promising approach in functional biogeography. It replaces the idiosyncrasy of species-specific climate ranges with a generic trait-based predictive framework. In addition, {{it has the potential to}} shed light on specific filter mechanisms creating large-scale vegetation patterns. However, its application to a continental flora, spanning large climate gradients, has been hampered by a lack of trait data. Here, we explore whether five key plant functional traits (seed mass, wood density, specific leaf area (SLA), maximum height, and longevity of a tree) —indicative of life history, mechanical, and physiological adaptations—explain the climate ranges of 250 North American tree species distributed from the boreal to the subtropics. Although the relationship between traits and the median climate across a species range is weak, quantile regressions revealed strong effects on <b>range</b> <b>limits.</b> Wood density and seed mass were strongly related to the lower but not <b>upper</b> temperature <b>range</b> <b>limits</b> of species. Maximum height affects the species <b>range</b> <b>limits</b> in both dry and humid climates, whereas SLA and longevity do not show clear relationships. These results allow the definition and delineation of climatic “no-go areas” for North American tree species based on key traits. As some of these key traits serve as important parameters in recent vegetation models, the implementation of trait-based climatic constraints has the potential to predict both range shifts and ecosystem consequences on a more functional basis. Moreover, for future trait-based vegetation models our results provide a benchmark for model evaluation...|$|R
