50|$|Wind {{power in}} New Zealand shares the {{difficulties}} typical to other nations (<b>uneven</b> <b>wind</b> strengths, ideal locations often remote from power demand areas). The Tararua Wind Farm averages {{slightly more than}} New Zealand's 45% full capacity usage (in other words, wind farms in New Zealand produce more than double their average energy during periods of maximum useful wind strengths). However, the New Zealand Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority figures indicate that wind power {{is also expected to}} operate at maximum capacity for around 4,000 hours a year, much more than for example the approximately 2,000 hours (Germany) to 3,000 hours (Scotland, Wales, Western Ireland) found in European countries.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In the paper, we {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} un-even slot arrangement for the reduction of pulsating torque in a surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor. The effect of the arrangement of slots and magnets on torque pulsation is studied numerically. The inequality in the slot arrangement reduces the 12 th harmonic pulsating torque and increases the 6 th harmonic one. In addition, we shape torque waveforms, based on the obtained results.

30|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of wind power around the world, its penetration {{in the power}} grid grows higher and higher. Different from the distributed utilization of wind power in North America and Europe, large-scale grid-connected and long distance transmission of wind power, also known as wind power base (WPB), is inevitable in China due to the <b>uneven</b> distribution of <b>wind</b> resources and load centers. The intermittent and stochastic of output power of wind farms, as well their easy tripping under abnormal conditions, will increase the occurrence probability of cascading failures in power systems.|$|R

2500|$|On 19 January 1989, a Widerøe Twin Otter became {{uncontrollable}} due to turbulence during {{final approach}} to Værøy. Control was regained {{when there was}} [...] height above the sea. This incident caused the airport to be temporarily closed. Widerøe Flight 839 took place on 12 April 1990, when a Twin Otter crashed into the sea just after take-off, killing all five people on board. The cause of the accident were strong winds that exceeded the structure's tolerance, causing the tail rudder and tailplane to crack so the plane became uncontrollable. <b>Uneven</b> and strong <b>winds</b> had given the airport low regularity, and prior to take-off, wind speeds of [...] had been recorded.|$|R
40|$|We {{measured}} newly-produced seeds {{entering the}} soil (Potential Seed Bank) to assess the timing and spatial patterning of Phase I dispersal in the central Monte desert, Argentina. Rates of forb- (6. 13 mg m - 2 d - 1) and shrub-seed input (48. 9 mg m - 2 d - 1) were maximum in early summer. The rate of grass-seed input, instead, was similar in early and late summer (7 to 8 mg m - 2 d - 1). About 90 % of forb- and shrub-seed mass entered the habitat through protected (i. e., under canopy) areas, whereas 70 % of grass-seed mass did so through exposed areas. Adult plant location and the <b>uneven</b> impact of <b>wind</b> on shrub, forb and grass seeds may explain such patterns...|$|R
50|$|The picture portrays {{an older}} man in a red robe, {{embracing}} a young child who is also wearing red. They sit in an interior, illuminated against a darkened wall. Behind them at right is a window through which can be seen a generalized landscape, its <b>uneven</b> terrain and <b>winding</b> roads typical of Ghirlandaio's backgrounds. Although the man's fur-lined robe and cappuccio and the boy's elegant doublet and cap indicate a noble heritage, and despite the traditional assumption that the subjects are grandfather and grandson, their identities are unknown. It {{is possible that the}} painting was commemorative in purpose, and that the child was a narrative invention intended to emphasize the man's beneficence. The poignancy of the image is dramatized by the contrast between the man's weathered and wise face, and the child's delicate profile. While the composition is thematically related to portraiture from the Netherlands, by the mid-15th century the motif of a portrait in an interior with a landscape seen in the distance was common in Italy.|$|R
5000|$|James {{believed}} that a lumber industry would help the Roanoke colony grow and become economically self-sufficient. He had a sawmill built on the island, so that lumber could be processed and sold to the government. Other natural resources could be sold elsewhere. He hoped to show that “free labor and technology was always superior to the slave system.” The sawmill had a seventy-horsepower engine, powerful for that time and venue. The mill was located at Pork Point near Union headquarters. A soldier stationed on the island described it in 1864 as “a first class affair, like most anything belonging to the Government.” James intended to arrange for the freedmen {{to get some of}} the lumber, so they could build sturdier cabins than their traditional split-pine one-room structures: [...] “Each house contains but one room, no rooms above. The boards used for building are made as follows. They cut down a pitch pine tree, then cut it in logs eight feet long, then with the ax and wedge, split into boards about ¾ inches in thickness, the grain being perfectly straight, but makes a very <b>uneven</b> surface. The <b>wind</b> blows through the crevices.” ...|$|R
5000|$|In the {{portable}} wooden form, at {{the centre of}} the instrument's length, each edge is slightly scooped out to allow the player to grasp it by the left hand, while he or she holds a small wooden (or sometimes iron) mallet in the right, with which to strike it in various parts and at various angles, eliciting loud, somewhat musical sounds (κροῦσμα, krousma). Although simple, the instrument nonetheless produces a strong resonance and a variety of different intonations, depending on the thickness of the place struck and the intensity of the force used, so that quite subtle results can be obtained. A metal semantron, smaller than those of wood, is usually hung near the entrance of the catholicon (the monastery's main church). In the traditional monastic ritual, before each service the assigned player takes a wooden semantron and, standing before the west end of the catholicon, strikes on it three hard and distinct blows with the mallet. He then proceeds round the outside of the church, turning to the four quarters and playing on the instrument by striking blows of varying force on different parts of the wood at <b>uneven</b> intervals, always <b>winding</b> up the [...] "tune" [...] with three blows similar to those at the beginning. Where there is a metal semantron, it is customary to strike it after the wooden one has been played. The semantron is sounded every midnight for night offices (Midnight Office and Matins); this is done by the candle-lighter (κανδηλάπτης, kandilaptis). The semantra are usually suspended by chains from a peg in the proaulion (porch of the catholicon) or perhaps outside the refectory door, or on a tree in the courtyard.|$|R
40|$|The European Union (EU) {{has laid}} down very clear {{objectives}} for {{the reduction of}} greenhouse gases {{in the hope that}} it will prevent or mitigate climate change. Political incentives are used to make the power industry adopt changes in order to reach these EU targets. In this thesis, some solutions that could help power companies meet the EU objectives are evaluated. Thermodynamic models have been developed to evaluate the proposed methods. A description of the models {{and the way in which}} they are used to model power plant cycles in off-design mode is included in this thesis. The focus was on combined-cycle power plants, which have the highest efficiency among commercial power plants today. Three ways of adapting power plants so as to meet the EU targets were formulated: • reduced CO 2 emissions • increased use of biofuels • improved part-load abilities A new method based on using low-grade heat when implementing carbon capture in a combined cycle power plant is presented. The results show that the method can increase the total efficiency and reduce the initial cost of the power plant. The method is applicable for both retrofitting to existing plants and for new plants. The effect of using low-calorific bio-fuels in a combined-cycle power plant was investigated. The results show that below a heating value of about 20 - 25 MJ/kg the plant quickly departs from its design point. The supply of power to the national grid is expected to be fluctuate more in the future due to the <b>uneven</b> availability of <b>wind</b> and solar power. Therefore, two part-load operation strategies were evaluated. The first involves a strategy that entails less wear on the gas turbine, which could extend the maintenance interval of the unit. The second method combines two well-established part-load strategies for part-load operation of steam-cycle power plants. The combination of the two methods will increase the part-load efficiency of the power plant...|$|R
