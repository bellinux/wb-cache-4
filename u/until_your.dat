It is uncertain how much Wilhelmina enjoyed the festivities; although writer Mike Peek, in a 2011 magazine article about Koninginnedag, suggests she was enthusiastic, there is a story of Wilhelmina, after a tired return from one of these birthday processions, making her doll bow until the toy's hair was dishevelled, and telling it, [...] "Now you shall sit in a carriage and bow <b>until</b> <b>your</b> back aches, and see how much you like being a Queen!" ...|$|E

He called the sound effects [...] "unbelievable", whilst the gameplay was described as containing an [...] "enormous amount of action". GameSpot reviewer Bob Colayco summarized his review by stating that Call of Duty 2 has [...] "smooth, detailed graphics and great sound", as well as praising the artificial intelligence, realism, and variety in the campaign. GamePro called the game [...] "breathtaking", and commended the game for its [...] "strikingly realistic detail on weapons and walls, emphasized by normal mapping, exceptional shading and lighting, specular highlights, and some absolutely phenomenal particle effects". GameSpy editor Will Tuttle called it [...] "One of the finest FPSs ever created.

500|$|At first, Nevermind did {{not receive}} many reviews, and many {{publications}} ignored the album. Months after its release and after [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] garnered airplay, print media organizations were [...] "scrambling" [...] to cover the phenomenon the album had become. However, by that point, much of the attention fell on Cobain rather than the album itself. The reviews that did initially appear were largely positive. Karen Schoemer of The New York Times wrote, [...] "With 'Nevermind,' Nirvana has certainly succeeded. There are enough intriguing textures, mood shifts, instrumental snippets and inventive word plays to provide for hours of entertainment." [...] Schoemer concluded, [...] "'Nevermind' is more sophisticated and carefully produced than anything peer bands like Dinosaur Jr. and Mudhoney have yet offered." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave Nevermind an A– rating, and reviewer David Browne argued that on Nevermind, Nirvana [...] "never entertain the notion" [...] of wanting to sound [...] "normal," [...] compared to other contemporary alternative bands. Concluding his very enthusiastic review for the British Melody Maker, Everett True wrote that [...] "When Nirvana released Bleach all those years ago, the more sussed among us figured they {{had the potential to}} make an album that would blow every other contender away. My God have they proved us right." [...] Spin gave Nevermind a favorable review stating that [...] "you'll be humming all the songs {{for the rest of your}} life—or at least <b>until</b> <b>your</b> CD-tape-album wears out." [...] Select compared the band to Jane's Addiction, Sonic Youth, and the Pixies, stating that the album [...] "proves that Nirvana truly belong in such high company." ...|$|E

Adams highlighted the serious discussion between Darryl and Jim in the warehouse, noting that [...] "Jim's extrication {{is something to}} root for", and that it honored [...] "Craig Robinson's dedication to the show". While feeling {{that some of the}} episode's subplots were [...] "forced", he did, however, compliment the Pam and Nellie pairing due to [...] "Pam's past ability to break through [...] Angela and Dwight's defenses". Bonnie Stiernberg of Paste magazine noted that, despite Andy's regression to [...] "his old ways", it was beneficial for the episode and allowed for many jokes to be played out. Furthermore, Stiernberg applauded the subtle drama that ran throughout the entry, writing Darryl, Erin, and Pete's interactions with Andy were important to the overall storyline. Mark Trammell of TV Equals named it [...] "the best episode of the final season of The Office to date" [...] because it [...] "played to the show's strengths". Furthermore, he complimented the character development of Nellie, writing that she [...] "really started to grow on me this week" [...] and that his favorite line was Darryl's [...] "words of wisdom" [...] to Jim: [...] "It's not real <b>until</b> <b>your</b> wife is on board." [...] Michael Tedder of New York magazine gave the episode a positive review and noted that [...] "It's been a while since The Office was this surprising and moving." [...] He wrote that the main plot allowed for [...] "overdue development" [...] in regards to other characters and applauded the continued drama involving Pam and Jim; he called the last shot [...] "quietly heartbreaking". He did, however, call it a [...] "particularly overstuffed episode", and felt that Erin's subplot could have been saved for a different episode.|$|E

Cave In formed in 1995 in Methuen, Massachusetts, where thereafter they began releasing several split singles and demos that eventually culminated in the 1998 compilation album Beyond Hypothermia. Cave In's first studio album, <b>Until</b> <b>Your</b> Heart Stops, was released later in 1998 through Hydra Head Records.

This new direction continued with Jupiter, Cave In's second studio album in 2000.
