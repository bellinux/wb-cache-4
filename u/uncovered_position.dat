40|$|Information Systems (IS) {{have been}} critiqued as {{pursuing}} techno-economic rationalities of western modernity with no recognition of alternative. Development has thus been critiqued as a western program promoted through discourses {{that do not}} admit local conditions and histories. Through critical discourse analysis (CDA) and {{a case study of}} Ghana's trade clearance system (TRADENET), we analyze how problematizations of IS in developing countries relate with local positions and contexts. TRADENET's effects vis-à-vis its problematization by powerful actors. We find that TRADENET is contradicted by historically formed behaviors, culture and traditions that were unrecognized in technical problematizations of trade, development and IS. Despite the importance of unrecognized, alternative or 'subaltern' positions in shaping IS in developing countries, they remain unrecognized in dominant or 'hegemonic' problematizations.

500|$|Competitive players need to {{know that}} tablebases ignore the fifty-move rule. According to that rule, if fifty moves have passed without a capture or a pawn move, either player may claim a draw. [...] FIDE changed the rules several times, {{starting}} in 1974, to allow one hundred moves for endgames where fifty moves were insufficient to win. In 1988, FIDE allowed seventy-five moves for KBBKN, KNNKP, KQKBB, KQKNN, KRBKR, and KQPKQ with the pawn on the seventh rank, because tablebases had <b>uncovered</b> <b>positions</b> in these endgames requiring more than fifty moves to win. In 1992, FIDE canceled these exceptions and restored the fifty-move rule to its original standing. Thus a tablebase may identify a position as won or lost, when it is in fact drawn by the fifty-move rule. In 2013, ICCF changed the rules for correspondence chess tournaments starting from 2014; a player may claim a win or draw based on six-man tablebases. In this case the fifty-move rule is not applied, and the number of moves to mate is not taken into consideration.|$|R

The youth is an interesting phenomenon by virtue of their complex nature. We will use Richard Jenkins’ theory about social identity and try to highlight some of the social identities which Hilltop Youth represents. The material about the youth is limited, and at some point incongruous. Therefore we went to Israel to interview experts at the area who could give us some useful information about the young movement. In the beginning of our investigation we wanted to interview participants from Hilltop, but unfortunately that wasn’t possible and therefore we chose to use experts as our respondents. On one hand Hilltop Youth is described as a radical group of terrorists {{and on the other hand}} as a subculture mixed by young people who gather in an agreement to live free.

30|$|An {{advantage}} of this approach {{lies in the fact}} that it does not assume international trade to occur merely from producers to final consumers. Rather, it allows us to describe international trade more appropriately as an international production network arising from a sequence of production steps involving potentially multiple countries before the final product can reach the final destination markets of consumers. Indeed countries in such production network may receive inputs from multiple sources and may contribute to the production process at multiple stages located in more than one country. To fully assess the role that countries play in international trade, it is therefore crucial to distinguish between flows of intermediate products and flows of final ones, and then <b>uncover</b> the <b>position</b> countries occupy at each production step of the underlying GVC.|$|R

Idiosyncratic connectivity is thought to be driven not simply by obviously shared characteristics among institutions, but more by latent characteristics that lead to the holding of related securities. We develop a graphical model for multivariate financial time series with interest in <b>uncovering</b> the latent <b>positions</b> of nodes in a network intended to capture idiosyncratic relationships.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the development of}} technology campuses and their role in stimulating innovation. The main result of this thesis is a model for understanding and managing {{the relationship between the}} built environment and innovation at the urban area level. This model developed mainly throughout an inductive approach in two core studies. The first is an exploratory research that <b>uncovers</b> and <b>positions</b> the link between innovation and the built environment by using inputs from theory (literature review) and empirical evidence (survey of 39 technology campuses). The second is an explanatory research that clarifies the relationship between innovation and the built environment based on empirical evidence in the practice of campus development (theory building from case studies). In this model, the built environment is a catalyst for innovation in technology campuses demonstrated by location decisions and interventions facilitating five interdependent conditions required for innovation in particular contexts. The empirical evidence supporting the model is structured and converted into information available to decision makers involved in the development of technology campuses. The so-called ‘campus decision maker Toolbox’ provides instruments that guide planners, designers and managers of campuses and cities during different stages of campus development. In theory, findings strengthen existing theoretical concepts connecting the fields of corporate real estate management, urban studies in the knowledge-based economy and economic geography. In practice, this understanding encourages the efficient and effective use of the many resources required to develop technology campuses. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Structural {{positions}} are {{very common in}} investment practice. A structural position {{is defined as a}} permanent overweighting of a riskier asset class relative to a prespecified benchmark portfolio. The most prominent example for a structural position is the equity bias in a balanced fund that arises by consistently overweighting equities in tactical asset allocation. Another example is the permanent allocation of credit in a fixed income portfolio with a government benchmark. The analysis provided in this article shows that whenever possible, structural positions should be avoided. Graphical illustrations based on Pythagorean theorem are used to make a connection between the active risk/return and the total risk/return framework. Structural positions alter the risk profile of the portfolio substantially, and the appeal of active management – to provide active returns uncorrelated to benchmark returns and hence to shift the efficient frontier outwards – gets lost. The article demonstrates that the commonly used alpha – tracking error criterion is not sufficient for active management. In addition, structural positions complicate measuring managers’ skill. The paper also develops normative implications for active portfolio management. Tactical asset allocation should be based on the comparison of expected excess returns of an asset class to the equilibrium risk premium of the same asset class and not to expected excess returns of other asset classes. For the cases, where structural positions cannot be avoided, a risk budgeting approach is introduced and applied to determine the optimal position size. Finally, investors are advised not to base performance evaluation only on simple manager rankings because this encourages managers to take structural positions and does not reward efforts to produce alpha. The same holds true for comparing managers’ information ratios. Information ratios, in investment practice defined as the ratio of active return to active risk, do not <b>uncover</b> structural <b>positions...</b>|$|R

A three-dimensional global fit analysis {{allows us to}} identify several time scales in {{the dynamics of the}} 2 D spectra ranging from 100 fs to ∼ 10 ps and to uncover the energy-transfer pathways in LHCII. In particular, the energy transfer between the chlorophyll b and chlorophyll a pools occurs within ∼ 1. 1 ps. Retrieved 2 D decay-associated spectra also <b>uncover</b> the spectral <b>positions</b> of corresponding diagonal peaks in the 2 D spectra. Residuals in the decay traces exhibit periodic modulations with different oscillation periods. However, only one of them can be associated with the excitonic cross-peaks in the 2 D spectrum, while the remaining ones are presumably of vibrational origin. For the interpretation of the spectroscopic data, we have applied a refined exciton model for LHCII. It reproduces the linear absorption, circular dichroism, and 2 D spectra at different waiting times. Several components of the energy transport are revealed from theoretical simulations that agree well with the experimental observations...|$|R
