The interruption of the war had forced the suspension of the rule to account for players' military service, however, and {{he was allowed to}} leave college. The Browns denied that they encouraged Adamle to drop out. Adamle may have been convinced to join the Browns by Gene Fekete, Dante Lavelli, Lou Groza and Bill Willis, four Browns players who were back at Ohio State to finish their studies after the 1946 season.|$|E
5|$|In adults, {{the initial}} {{treatment}} for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete {{within two hours}} <b>under</b> <b>normal</b> <b>circumstances,</b> so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. Gastric lavage, better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Activated charcoal {{is the most common}} gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it adsorbs paracetamol, reducing its gastrointestinal absorption. Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of aspiration than gastric lavage.|$|E
5|$|The blunted {{ventilatory}} {{response is}} attributed to several factors. Obese people tend to have raised levels of the hormone leptin, which is secreted by adipose tissue and <b>under</b> <b>normal</b> <b>circumstances</b> increases ventilation. In OHS, this effect is reduced. Furthermore, episodes of nighttime acidosis (e.g. due to sleep apnea) lead to compensation by the kidneys with retention of the alkali bicarbonate. This normalizes the acidity of the blood. However, bicarbonate stays around in the bloodstream for longer, and further episodes of hypercapnia lead to relatively mild acidosis and reduced ventilatory response in a vicious circle.|$|E
50|$|Inhibitory receptors {{recognize}} self-MHC class I molecules {{on target}} self cells, causing the activation of signaling pathways that stop the cytolytic function of NK cells. Self-MHC class I molecules are always expressed <b>under</b> <b>normal</b> <b>circumstance.</b> According to the missing-self hypothesis, inhibitory KIR receptors recognize the downregulation of MHC class I molecules in virally-infected or transformed self cells, leading these receptors to stop sending the inhibition signal, which then {{leads to the}} lysis of these unhealthy cells. Because natural killer cells target virally infected host cells and tumor cells, inhibitory KIR receptors are important in facilitating self-tolerance.|$|R

In the case of Cien Caras, Steel, and Héctor Garza, their departures from the company were so sudden and unexpected that no plans were in place and CMLL had to organize a tournament to determine the next champion. In Máximo Sexy's case he was fired from the company while still the champion, causing the championship to be vacated as a result.|$|E
5|$|Club {{competitions}} between {{teams from}} different European countries can trace their origins {{as far back}} as 1897, when the Challenge Cup was created for clubs in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, who did not meet <b>under</b> <b>normal</b> <b>circumstances.</b> The Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy, named after entrepreneur and sportsman Thomas Lipton, was established in 1909 and was contested between clubs from Italy, Great Britain, Germany and Switzerland; the competition lasted for two years. The earliest attempt to create a cup for national champion clubs of Europe was made by Swiss club FC Servette. Founded in 1930, the Coupe des Nations featured clubs of ten major European football leagues and was deemed a success. Due to financial reasons, the competition was abandoned.|$|E
50|$|Later vacuum-chamber {{experiments}} {{suggested that}} the unwinding of the reel uncovered pinholes in the insulation. That in itself would not have caused a major problem, because the ionosphere around the tether, <b>under</b> <b>normal</b> <b>circumstance,</b> was too rarefied to divert much of the current. However, the air trapped in the insulation changed that. As it bubbled out of the pinholes, the high voltage of the nearby tether, about 3500 volts, converted it into a plasma (in a way similar to the ignition of a fluorescent tube), a relatively dense one and therefore a much better conductor of electricity. This plasma diverted to the metal of the shuttle {{and from there to}} the ionospheric return circuit. That current was enough to melt the cable.|$|R
40|$|As {{the most}} {{important}} formal semantic model, labeled transition systems are widely used, which can describe the general concurrent systems or control systems without disturbance. However, <b>under</b> <b>normal</b> <b>circumstance,</b> transition systems are complex and difficult to use due to large amount of calculation and the state space explosion problems. In order to overcome these problems, approximate equivalent labeled transition systems are proposed by means of incomplete low-up matrix decomposition factorization. This technique can reduce the complexity of computation and calculate under the allowing errors. As for continuous-time linear systems, we develop a modeling method of approximated transition system based on the approximate solution of matrix, which provides a facility for approximately formal semantic modeling for linear systems and to effectively analyze errors. An example of application {{in the context of}} linear systems without disturbances is studied...|$|R

5|$|Crops {{included}} wheat, rye, barley and oats. Peas, beans, and vetches became common {{from the}} 13th century onward as a fodder crop for animals {{and also for}} their nitrogen-fixation fertilizing properties. Crop yields peaked in the 13th century, and stayed more or less steady until the 18th century. Though the limitations of medieval farming were once thought to have provided a ceiling for the population growth in the Middle Ages, {{recent studies have shown}} that the technology of medieval agriculture was always sufficient for the needs of the people <b>under</b> <b>normal</b> <b>circumstances,</b> and that it was only during exceptionally harsh times, such as the terrible weather of 1315–17, that the needs of the population could not be met.|$|E

A rookie, Stuart Roosa, was designated the Command Module Pilot. Shepard asked for Jim McDivitt as his Lunar Module Pilot, but McDivitt, who had already commanded the Apollo 9 mission, balked at the prospect, arguing that Shepard did not have sufficient Apollo training to command a Moon mission.

5|$|A slow-moving {{predator}} feeding {{mainly on}} bony fishes, the sicklefin lemon shark seldom travels long distances and many individuals {{can be found}} year-round at certain locations. Like other members of its family, this species is viviparous, with females giving birth {{to no more than}} 13 pups every other year, following a gestation period of 1011 months. Although they are potentially dangerous to humans and known to respond vigorously to any provocation, <b>under</b> <b>normal</b> <b>circumstances,</b> sicklefin lemon sharks are cautious and tend to retreat if approached. The IUCN has assessed this species as Vulnerable; its low reproductive productivity and rate of movement limits the capacity of depleted stocks to recover. Off India and Southeast Asia, this species has been severely depleted or extirpated by unregulated exploitation for its meat, fins, and liver oil.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{is known}} to affect several {{different}} biological targets. It often {{is described as a}} norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), and is also a nicotinic antagonist.

In June 2008, citing hikes in the price of oil and the need to contain operational costs, the airline reduced frequencies across its network and announced an increase in airfares to offset the increased costs, whilst taking advantage of the lower cost of jet fuel at Delhi, Kolkata and Bangkok airports. Due to its small network which is reliant on fifth-freedom rights, Drukair regularly leases its aircraft to other airlines, such as Myanmar Airways International, Indian Airlines and Bangkok Airways in order to keep utilisation rates on its aircraft higher than they would <b>under</b> <b>normal</b> <b>circumstances,</b> whilst at the same time earning extra revenue.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of his performances, Fingleton was {{recalled}} to the Test team for the tour of South Africa in 1935–36, where he partnered Brown {{at the top of the}} innings. <b>Under</b> <b>normal</b> <b>circumstances,</b> the Australians would have been captained by Fingleton's rival Bradman, who had been vice-captain to Woodfull. However, Bradman was unable to tour for medical reasons and Vic Richardson led the team instead. With Bradman out of the way, the tour was to be the most prolific and peaceful phase of Fingleton's international career and included several large opening stands with Brown. During the tour, Fingleton played with an attacking flair that contrasted with his established reputation for doggedness. For Fingleton, it was the happiest tour he had been on, in large part due to Bradman's absence.|$|E
5|$|A bypass {{platform}} is provided to these polymerases by Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). <b>Under</b> <b>normal</b> <b>circumstances,</b> PCNA bound to polymerases replicates the DNA. At {{a site of}} lesion, PCNA is ubiquitinated, or modified, by the RAD6/RAD18 proteins to provide a platform for the specialized polymerases to bypass the lesion and resume DNA replication. After translesion synthesis, extension is required. This extension {{can be carried out}} by a replicative polymerase if the TLS is error-free, {{as in the case of}} Pol η, yet if TLS results in a mismatch, a specialized polymerase is needed to extend it; Pol ζ. Pol ζ is unique in that it can extend terminal mismatches, whereas more processive polymerases cannot. So when a lesion is encountered, the replication fork will stall, PCNA will switch from a processive polymerase to a TLS polymerase such as Pol ι to fix the lesion, then PCNA may switch to Pol ζ to extend the mismatch, and last PCNA will switch to the processive polymerase to continue replication.|$|E

40|$|Cell {{turnover}} time varies from one tissue to another but is reproducible as a hereditary character-istic {{for a given}} cell line.

5|$|Stephen had {{at least}} four {{brothers}} and one sister, along with two probable half-sisters. Stephen's eldest brother was William, who <b>under</b> <b>normal</b> <b>circumstances</b> would have ruled the county. William was probably intellectually disabled, and Adela instead had the title passed over him to her second son, Theobald, who went on later to acquire the county of Champagne as well as Blois and Chartres. Stephen's remaining older brother, Odo, died young, probably in his early teens. His younger brother, Henry of Blois, was probably born four years after him. The brothers formed a close-knit family group, and Adela encouraged Stephen {{to take up the}} role of a feudal knight, whilst steering Henry towards a career in the church, possibly so that their personal career interests would not overlap. Unusually, Stephen was raised in his mother's household rather than being sent to a close relative; he was taught Latin and riding, and was educated in recent history and Biblical stories by his tutor, William the Norman.|$|E
5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, the British economy {{depended}} on {{its ability to}} trade with the British Empire, particularly the valuable colonies in British India. The intercontinental trade was conducted by the governors of India, the Honourable East India Company (HEIC), using their fleet of large, well-armed merchant vessels known as East Indiamen. These ships were of between 500 and 1200 nominal tons burthen (bm) and could carry up to 36 guns for defence against pirates, privateers and small warships. They were not, however, capable <b>under</b> <b>normal</b> <b>circumstances</b> of fighting off an enemy frigate or ship of the line. Their guns were usually of inferior design, and their crew smaller and less well trained than those on a naval ship. The East Indiamen sought {{to ensure the safety of}} their cargo and passengers, not defeat enemy warships in battle. Despite these disadvantages, the size of East Indiamen meant that from a distance they appeared quite similar to a small ship of the line, a deception usually augmented by paintwork and dummy cannon. At the Bali Strait Incident of 28 January 1797 an unescorted convoy of East Indiamen had used this similarity to intimidate a powerful French frigate squadron into withdrawing without a fight. In February 1799 an attack by a combined French-Spanish squadron on the assembled convoy at Macau was driven off in the Macau Incident without combat by the small Royal Navy escort squadron.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the fiscal}} {{pressure}} on the kingdom caused by Edward's expensive alliances led to discontent at home. The regency council at home was frustrated by the mounting national debt, while the king and his commanders on the Continent were angered {{by the failure of}} the government in England to provide sufficient funds. To deal with the situation, Edward himself returned to England, arriving in London unannounced on 30 November 1340. Finding the affairs of the realm in disorder, he purged the royal administration of a great number of ministers and judges. These measures did not bring domestic stability, and a stand-off ensued between the king and John de Stratford, Archbishop of Canterbury, during which Stratford's relatives Robert Stratford Bishop of Chichester and Henry de Stratford were temporarily stripped of title and imprisoned respectively. Stratford claimed that Edward had violated the laws of the land by arresting royal officers. A certain level of conciliation was reached at the parliament of April 1341. Here Edward was forced to accept severe limitations to his financial and administrative freedom, in return for a grant of taxation. Yet in October the same year, the king repudiated this statute and Archbishop Stratford was politically ostracised. The extraordinary circumstances of the April parliament had forced the king into submission, but <b>under</b> <b>normal</b> <b>circumstances</b> the powers of the king in medieval England were virtually unlimited, a fact that Edward was able to exploit.|$|E
