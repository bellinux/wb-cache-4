5|$|Current {{commonly}} accepted physical theories imply or {{assume the}} photon to be strictly massless. If the photon {{is not a}} strictly massless particle, it would not move at the exact speed of light, c in vacuum. Its speed would be lower and depend on its frequency. Relativity would be unaffected by this; the so-called speed of light, c, would then not be the actual speed at which light moves, but a constant of nature which is the <b>upper</b> <b>bound</b> <b>on</b> speed that any object could theoretically attain in space-time. Thus, {{it would still be}} the speed of space-time ripples (gravitational waves and gravitons), but it would not be the speed of photons.|$|E

25|$|A sup (supremum) of X is a least <b>upper</b> <b>bound</b> <b>on</b> X, namely an <b>upper</b> <b>bound</b> <b>on</b> X {{that is less}} {{or equal}} to every <b>upper</b> <b>bound</b> <b>on</b> X.

The empty sup is 0 (the bottom element) and the empty inf is 1 (top). It follows that every finite set has both a sup and an inf. Infinite subsets of a Boolean algebra {{may or may not}} have a sup and/or an inf; in a power set algebra they always do.|$|E
