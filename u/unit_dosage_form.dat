50|$|A tablet is a {{pharmaceutical}} dosage form. Tablets {{may be defined}} as the solid <b>unit</b> <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> of medicament or medicaments with or without suitable excipients and prepared either by molding or by compression. It comprises a mixture of active substances and excipients, usually in powder form, pressed or compacted from a powder into a solid dose. The excipients can include diluents, binders or granulating agents, glidants (flow aids) and lubricants to ensure efficient tabletting; disintegrants to promote tablet break-up in the digestive tract; sweeteners or flavours to enhance taste; and pigments to make the tablets visually attractive or aid in visual identification of an unknown tablet. A polymer coating is often applied to make the tablet smoother and easier to swallow, to control the release rate of the active ingredient, to make it more resistant to the environment (extending its shelf life), or to enhance the tablet's appearance.|$|E

40|$|A major {{constraint}} in oral {{controlled drug}} delivery {{is that not}} all drug candidates are absorbed uniformly throughout the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Some drugs are ab-sorbed only in a particular portion of GIT or are absorbed to a different extent in various segments of GIT. An absorption window exists because of physiological, physicochemical or biochemical factors. Recent scientific and patent literature reveals increased interest in novel dosage forms that can be retained in the stomach for a prolonged and predict-able period of time. One of the most feasible approaches is to control the gastric residen-ce time using gastroretentive dosage forms (GRDDS) that can provide newer therapeutic options. GRDDS can improve controlled delivery of drugs by continuously releasing the drug for a prolonged period of time before it reaches its absorption site, thus ensuring its optimal bioavailability (1).

Fast dissolving tablets (FDTs) are solid <b>unit</b> <b>dosage</b> <b>form,</b> which disintegrate or dissolve rapidly without chewing or water. FDTs provide an advantage particularily for pediatric, geriatric, and bedridden or mentally disabled patients. Nimesulide is a crystalline and poor bioavailable drug because of its high hydrophobicity and poor aqueous solubility. Spherical micropelletization technique is a possible approach which provides maximum dissolution with enhanced wettability as well as uniform and spherical pellet size to achieve the smooth gastric transit of drug.

To test the functionality of novel excipients, Sonnergaard proved a simple linear model to confirm compactability, which is an uncomplicated tool for quantification. The tablets were compressed at increasing compression pressures and were evaluated for various mechanical properties. The linear relationship between specific crushing strength and compression pressure revealed the compactibility of the herbal granules and the linear relationship between porosity and logarithm of compression pressure revealed the compressible nature of the herbal granules according to the model developed by Sonnergaard.

40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to prepare a gastroretentive drug delivery system of Imatinib mesylate. Materials and Method: Floating tablets of imatinib mesylate were prepared employing HPMC K 4 M and HPMC K 15 M by effervescent technique; these grades of HPMC were evaluated for their gel forming properties. Sodium bicarbonate was incorporated as a gas-generating agent. The floating tablets were evaluated for uniformity of weight, hardness, friability, drug content, in vitro buoyancy and dissolution studies. Results: The prepared tablets exhibited satisfactory physico-chemical characteristics. All the prepared batches showed good in vitro buoyancy. The tablet swelled radially and axially during in vitro buoyancy studies. It was observed that the tablet remained buoyant for > 12 hours. The tablets with HPMC K 4 M were found to float for longer duration as compared with formulations containing HPMC K 15 M. The drug release from the tablets was sufficiently sustained and non-Fickian transport of the drug from tablets was confirmed.

Several strategies to improve the solubility and dissolution of poorly water soluble drugs have been developed, which were at start primarily based on modifying the drug’s physicochemical properties. Realization that the oral bioavailability of poor water soluble drugs may be enhanced when co-administered with meal rich in fat has led to increasing recent interest {{in the formulation of}} poorly water soluble drugs in lipids. Lipid-based drug delivery systems have gained considerable interest after the commercial success of Sandimmune NeoralTM (Cyclosporine A), Novartis Pvt.

When such a system is released in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract, it disperses to form a fine w/o microemulsion with the aid of GI fluid.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. Controlled release systems aim at {{achieving}} a predictable and reproducible drug release profile over a desired time period. These controlled release formulations offer many advantages over conventional <b>dosage</b> <b>forms.</b> These advantages include: reduced dosing intervals, constant drug {{levels in the}} blood, increased patient compliance and decreased adverse effects. Complex controlled release formulations such as those with sustained release properties, often require additional steps during the production phase. The cost and economic impact associated with these complex controlled release dosage formulations often outweigh the short term benefits. Thus {{the development of an}} economic method to produce controlled release particles is of great importance especially in third world countries. In controlled release formulations the drug is often equally dispersed throughout a polymer matrix. In the presence of a thermodynamically compatible solvent, swelling occurs and the polymer releases its content to the surrounding medium. The rate of drug release can be controlled by interfering with the amount of swelling and rate of diffusion by manipulating the viscosity of the polymer matrix. Chitosan is an ideal candidate for controlled drug delivery through matrix release systems. It is a biodegradable polymer with absorption-enhancing properties. Cross-linking chitosan with different cross-linking agents allow the preparation of beads. Beads are frequently used in controlled release <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> as they are very flexible in <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> development and show various advantages over single <b>unit</b> <b>dosage</b> <b>forms.</b> Because beads disperse freely in the gastrointestinal tract they maximize drug absorption, reduce fluctuation in peak plasma, and minimize potential side effects without lowering drug bio-availability. Chitosan beads and excipient containing chitosan beads were prepared and investigated as possible controlled release formulations. Pyrazinamide was chosen as the model drug. Chitosan beads and excipient containing chitosan beads were prepared by ionotropic gelation in tripolyphosphate. In this study chitosan/pyrazinamide beads containing pharmaceutical excipients (Ascorbic acid, Explotab and Ac-Di-Sol) were produced. The excipients were added individually and in combinations to the chitosadpyrazinamide dispersion and the beads were characterized {{on the basis of their}} morphology, solubility, fiability, drug loading capacity and swelling behaviour, as well as drug release (dissolution properties). The drug loading of the pyrazinarnide loaded chitosan beads, was 52. 26 % 0. 57 %. It was noted that the inclusion of excipients in the beads resulted in an increase in drug loading with the combination of Ascorbic acid and Ac-Di-Sol giving the highest drug loading of 67. 09 ± 0. 22 %. It was expected that the addition of the pharmaceutical excipients would lead to a sustained release of pyrazinamide. Dissolutions studies, however, revealed a burst release in both phosphate buffer solution (PBS) pH 5. 60 and 7. 40 over the first 15 minutes and the curve reached a plateau after 30 minutes. Thus, apparently the inclusion of the pharmaceutical excipients did not contribute to a sustained release of pyrazinamide over the tested period of six hours. In future studies the dissolution time can possibly be extended to a period of 24 hours. It might be possible for the remaining drug (approximately 40 %) in the beads to be released over the extended period. Other polymers can also be investigated to control the release of pyrazinamide. Further studies are, however, necessary to investigate this possibility in the future. Master...|$|R
40|$|Conventional solid <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> {{often lead}} to {{fluctuations}} which exceed the maximum safe therapeutic level and/or decline below the minimum effective level. It is recognised that many drugs for chronic administration should be administered on a schedule that maintains plasma drug concentration within the therapeutic window. Research in controlled release <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> aims at designing a system with a zero-order input (eg, ideally to deliver 8. 33 % of the dose per hour over a 12 hour duration), producing steady state plasma drug levels. Oral dministration of drugs prepared as a controlled release formulation is extremely popular, and has {{attracted the attention of}} pharmaceutical scientists during the last decade. This has been due to the simultaneous convergence of various factors (eg, discovery of novel polymers and devices, better understanding of formulation and physiological constraints, expiration of existing patents, prohibitive cost of developing new drug entities), involved in the development of these delivery systems. Controlled release oral products can be formulated as single or multiple <b>unit</b> <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> and the relative merits of multiple unit forms with their own rate controlling systems are well established. This work describes the development of a relatively inexpensive multiple-unit capsule <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> of theophylline containing coated mini-tablets for drug delivery throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Preformulation studies on theophylline anhydrous included solubility and dissolution rate determinations. Techniques including X-ray powder diffraction, differential scanning colorimetry and infrared spectroscopy provided no evidence of true polymorphism after recrystallisation from various solvents. However, scanning electron micrographs showed the effects of solvent polarity and cooling rate on {{the size and shape of}} recrystallised particles. Theophylline granules were manufactured by using various binders and were film coated by fluidised bed technology with various proportions of ethylcellulose, containing varying amounts of PEG 1540. In vitro release rates were dependent upon coating thickness and the proportion of PEG, which, being water soluble, created pores in the coating during dissolution studies as observed by a scanning electron microscope. However, substantial proportions of the drug remained unreleased from the granules. In order to overcome the problems of drug retention, plain granules were used and theophylline mini-tablets (3 mm diameter, weighing 15 - 20 mg) were manufactured and film coated with various Eudragits ® and other polymeric mixtures (soluble and insoluble). In vitro dissolution profiles from samples enclosed in hard gelatin capsules were determined using the USPXXI paddle apparatus in test media at pH 1. 2 (HCI), pH 5. 4 and 7. 4 (phosphate buffers) at 37 'C. Monitoring of in vitro theophylline release over 12 h, under identical hydrodynamic conditions, showed that the dissolution rate at pH 1. 2 is substantially greater (95 % of total drug content released in < 10 h) than that in phosphate buffers. The maximum release after 12 h was approximately 20 and 30 % of total drug content of the tablet at pH 5. 4 and 7. 4, respectively. However, in vivo bioavailability after oral administration of tablets to rabbits corresponded to over 95 % of total drug, compared with the same dose administered intravenously. The retarded drug release during in vitro dissolution in phosphate buffer was attributed to a possible interaction of phosphate ions with theophylline molecules at the tablet core-coat interface. These findings indicate that both rate and extent of theophylline release from the slow release coated mini-tablets are highly sensitive to phosphate buffers. The data also emphasise the usefulness of an animal model for assessment of in vivo drug release and subsequent absorption during the development of modified release <b>dosage</b> <b>forms.</b> Mini-tablets were subjected to isothermal and cyclic stresses to reach conditions for up to 6 months at different temperatures and relative humidity. The film integrity was maintained but ageing of the coating occurred which impeded dissolution. Reduced drug release was temperature related while the effect of relative humidi% was insignific~t. Encapsulated mini-tablets (uncoated and coated with Eudragit RL and RS 2 % w/w) equivalent to a 300 mg dose, were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo using beagle dogs. The pharmacokinetic parameters from single and multiple dose studies showed several advantages over Theo-Dur® 300 mg tablets. Precise dosage titration is possible by careful adjustment of the number of encapsulated mini-tablets. This multiple unit mini-tablet delivery system will allow for greater flexibility in dosage adjustment compared to the currently available preparations, allowing individualised fine dose titration in those patients requiring therapeutic drug monitoring. The developmentof the multiple unit mini-tablet formulation appears to provide an optimal <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> with maximum flexibility in respect of dose, duration range and ease of production. ...|$|R

The rate of absorption of a formulation depends on the <b>dosage</b> <b>form,</b> route of administration and particle size. Some solid <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> like shiyaf (suppository), zarur (dusting powder), noorah (depilatory) are used locally to produce their respective actions. But unfortunately some effective and potent <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> are neither used nor manufactured and they are near to extinct. Therefore in the present review an effort {{has been made to}} summarize the detailed Unani classical literature of solid <b>dosage</b> <b>forms...</b>|$|R

The vehicle of a oral <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> was modified and the molecular {{structure of a}} parenteral <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> was modified. An oral <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> was tested in vitro using dissolution apparatus. A parenteral <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> was tested in vivo using rats. A new oral suspension <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> for acetylsalicylic acid was compared to two controlled release forms and two immediate release <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> which are currently commercially available. A parenteral thrombomodulin analogue conjugated to polyethylene glycol was compared to the unconjugated thrombomodulin analogue.

40|$|Among all <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> tablet is {{the most}} popular <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> {{existing}} today because of its convenience of self administration, compactness and easy manufacturing; sometimes immediate onset of action is required than conventional therapy in many cases. So that to overcome these drawbacks, immediate release <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> has emerged as alternative oral <b>dosage</b> <b>forms.</b> Immediate drug release <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> disintegrate rapidly after administration with enhanced rate of dissolution. The basic approach used in development tablets is the use of superdisintegrants like Cross linked Polyvinylpyrrolidone or crospovidone (Polyplasdone), Sodium starch glycolate (Primogel, Explotab), carboxymethylcellulose (Croscarmellose) etc. These superdisintegrants provide instantaneous disintegration of tablet after administration in stomach. In this field immediate release liquid <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> and parenteral <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> have also been introduced for treating patients. In liquid <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> can be suspensions with typical dispersion agents like hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, AOT (dioctylsulfosuccinate) etc. The development of immediate release therapy also provides an opportunity for a line extension in the marketplace, a wide range of drugs e. g., neuroleptics, cardiovascular drugs, analgesics, antihistamines and other drugs can be considered candidates for this <b>dosage</b> <b>form.</b> As a drug entity nears the end of its patent life, it is common for pharmaceutical manufacturers to develop a given drug entity in a new and improved <b>dosage</b> <b>form.</b> A new <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> allows a manufacturer to extend market exclusivity, while offering its patient population a more convenient <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> or dosing regimen.

40|$|There {{were many}} natural {{pharmaceutical}} <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> cited by Persian pharmacists and physicians {{in the historical}} pharmacopeias (Qarabadins). This work aimed to perform a comprehensive study on “Qarābādin-e-Sālehi” (1765 A. D.), {{one of the main}} Persian pharmaceutical manuscripts defining traditional <b>dosage</b> <b>forms.</b> All traditional <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> as well as their definitions, descriptions and considerations were extracted by reviewing “Qarābādin-e-Sālehi”. Then, the textbook of “Aulton's Pharmaceutics; the design and manufacture of medicines” was considered to compare the medieval knowledge of pharmaceutics with current ones. Overall, there were 226 different <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> which have been cited in traditional Persian pharmacy. Since many of them were related to the preparation method, the final list of <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> was shortened to nearly 60 items including solid, semisolid, liquid and gaseous forms. On the other hand, almost 40 forms with oral, topical, nasal, parenteral, vaginal and rectal routes of administration are mentioned as current <b>dosage</b> <b>forms.</b> Some of the <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> are similar or as the same in traditional and current pharmacy. But, there were too many novel <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> in traditional Persian pharmacy. There were 11 types of traditional nasal forms whereas, this route is still known as a novel route of administration. Also 5 different ophthalmic <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> have been cited in the textbook. Many of traditional <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> were designed according to the medical purposes. Several current <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> have roots in the historical definitions and can be found in Persian medicine. However, there are forgotten traditional <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> which can be modified and optimized in pharmacy nowadays...|$|R
