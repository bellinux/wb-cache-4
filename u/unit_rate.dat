50|$|Low water {{tariffs and}} {{inappropriate}} tariff structures do not encourage water conservation. For example, decreasing-block rates, {{under which the}} <b>unit</b> <b>rate</b> decreases with consumption, offer hardly any incentive for water conservation. In 2000 about 51% of water tariffs in the U.S.were uniform (i.e. the unit tariff is independent {{of the level of}} consumption), 12% were increasing-block tariffs (the <b>unit</b> <b>rate</b> increases with consumption) and 19% were decreasing-block tariffs. The use of decreasing-block tariffs declined sharply from 45% of all tariff structures in 1992. Sewer rates are often flat rates that are not linked to consumption, thus offering no incentive to conserve water.|$|E

50|$|Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG) {{is based}} on a {{reference}} frame comoving with the geocenter (the center of the Earth), and is defined in principle for use for calculations concerning phenomena on or in the region of the Earth, such as planetary rotation and satellite motions. To a much smaller extent than with TCB compared with TDB, but for a corresponding reason, the SI second of TCG when observed from the Earth's surface shows a slight acceleration on the SI seconds realized by Earth-surface-based clocks. Accordingly, Terrestrial Time (TT) has also been defined as a scaled version of TCG, with the scaling such that on the defined geoid the <b>unit</b> <b>rate</b> is equal to the SI second, albeit that in terms of TCG the SI second of TT is a very little slower (this time by 1 part in 1/LG = 1 part in 1010/6.969290134).|$|E
40|$|Route {{charges are}} fees that {{airlines}} pay {{in order to}} utilize the Air Navigation Services (ANS) of a European state. The fee is based on three values; {{the weight of the}} aircraft, the length of the flight, and the state’s specific <b>unit</b> <b>rate.</b> The <b>unit</b> <b>rate</b> of each state is in turn based on the forecasted costs of providing ANS for that state and the amount of traffic forecasted for the year to come. This makes for different unit rates for different states, which leads to different costs for flying different routes in the European airspace. A state having costs that are increasing faster than the amount of traffic is increasing will lead to a higher <b>unit</b> <b>rate.</b> A higher <b>unit</b> <b>rate</b> may lead to airlines avoiding the state’s airspace due to higher costs, thus accounting for even less traffic and an increase in <b>unit</b> <b>rate.</b> This thesis examines the relationship between <b>unit</b> <b>rate</b> and amount of traffic, and specifically tries to find out how much the <b>unit</b> <b>rate</b> affects the traffic count. This has been done by reading previous papers on the subject, and creating a model to easily present facts found. The result of the thesis suggests that states actually profits more by increasing the <b>unit</b> <b>rate</b> rather than actively trying to reduce it. This contradicts the idea of lowering prices always being a good thing.
