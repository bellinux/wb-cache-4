The paper first reviews the various forms of <b>use</b> <b>rights,</b> ranging from access <b>rights</b> (territorial <b>use</b> <b>rights</b> and limited entry) to quantitative input (effort) and output (harvest) rights.

The {{recording}} process was plagued with problems, many {{as a result of}} substance abuse issues. While struggling to record the song [...] "Cornucopia" [...] after [...] "sitting {{in the middle of the}} room, just doing drugs", Ward was nearly fired from the band. [...] "I hated the song, there were some patterns that were just... horrible" [...] Ward said. [...] "I nailed it in the end, but the reaction I got was the cold shoulder from everybody. It was like 'Well, just go home, you're not being of any <b>use</b> <b>right</b> now.' I felt like I'd blown it, I was about to get fired". The album was originally titled Snowblind after the song of the same name, which deals with cocaine abuse. The record company changed the title at the last minute to Black Sabbath Vol. 4, with Ward stating [...] "There was no Volume 1, 2 or 3, so it's a pretty stupid title really".|$|E

40|$|Land-titling programs, {{land and}} forest {{allocation}} programs, and projects on state-allocated land for development {{and investment in}} Laos have been key drivers of change in land tenure. These have triggered major shifts in land <b>use</b> <b>rights,</b> from customary, to temporary, and then to permanent land <b>use</b> <b>rights.</b> This article explores how government programs to grant land <b>use</b> <b>rights</b> to individual households have affected the way people {{have been able to}} acquire and secure land tenure. For our case study, we selected the village of Napo, the target of many land tenure changes in the past four decades. We collected data from district offices, group discussions with village organizations, and interviews with selected households. The study shows how land <b>use</b> <b>rights</b> shifted over time and reveals that households obtained most of their agricultural land and forestland through a claim process. Original households were mainly land claimers, while migrants were land buyers. The process of formalization and allocation of tenure triggered inequality among households. Attention is needed in future land governance and tenure reforms in order to safeguard the land <b>use</b> <b>rights</b> of local people in an equitable manner. land use rights; land tenure; property rights; land acquisition; household land; land formalization; Lao...|$|R
