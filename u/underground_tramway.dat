5|$|There were {{numerous}} proposals {{at the time}} to build an electric aerial tramway, with one such line to go down the Avenida de Mayo. One proposal was the 1889 Le Tellier proposal, which envisioned multiple lines running along the city's wider avenues with the trams moved using cables and would hang from steel rails fixed to 6 metre high steel and iron posts positioned in 10–15 metre intervals. The lines would take 24 months to build and construction would commence 3 months after their approval by the Argentine National Congress, a decision which was ultimately not taken, favouring instead an <b>underground</b> <b>tramway.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1839, in {{anticipation}} of the opening of Victoria and London Road stations, there was a proposal to construct a connecting underground railway tunnel, but this was abandoned on economic grounds. Over the years, a number of other unsuccessful schemes were put forward to connect Manchester's rail termini, including an <b>underground</b> <b>tramway</b> in 1903 and 1914 and an underground railway in 1938.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s {{the concept of}} the sub-surface tramway was finally {{accepted}} and on 9 August 1967 the building of the first station (Hlavní nádraží) started. However, in the same year, a substantial change in the concept came, as the government, under the influence of Soviet advisers, decided to build a true metro system instead of an <b>underground</b> <b>tramway.</b> Thus, during the first years, the construction continued while the whole project was conceptually transformed. Regular service on the first section of Line C began on 9 May 1974 between Sokolovská (now Florenc) and Kačerov stations.|$|E

50|$|During the Industrial Revolution, Wales {{was at the}} {{forefront}} of the development of new technologies for the mining industry. These innovations included the use of water power for winding gear, the provision of mine ventilation, the use of steam engines for both winding and pumping and the use of <b>underground</b> <b>tramways</b> and canals for transport. Welsh mine-owners pioneered the use of horse-drawn and later steam railways to transport coal to the docks. The transfer from wood to coal as fuel that occurred during the Industrial Revolution was heavily influenced by Welsh innovations.|$|R

50|$|The AATC {{operated}} a {{vast network of}} trams in Buenos Aires by the early 20th century and the company set out to build the first <b>underground</b> <b>tramway</b> in the city, which later {{became part of the}} Underground network. The line would go underground through the centre of Buenos Aires and then continue as an overground tram service using a ramp at Primera Junta station, which leads to what is today the location of the Polvorín Workshop where it continued through the Caballito neighbourhood. The company needed rolling stock to serve the new line and thus took bids from two companies: the United Electric Car Company and the Belgian company La Brugeoise et Nicaise et Delcuve.|$|E

25|$|English {{inventor}} Thomas Parker, who {{was responsible}} for innovations such as electrifying the London <b>Underground,</b> overhead <b>tramways</b> in Liverpool and Birmingham, and the smokeless fuel coalite, built the first production electric car in London in 1884, using his own specially designed high-capacity rechargeable batteries. Parker's long-held interest in the construction of more fuel-efficient vehicles led him to experiment with electric vehicles. He also may have been concerned about the malign effects smoke and pollution were having in London.|$|R
5000|$|After 1948, {{the short}} tramway {{connecting}} the quarries to the slate cutting shed at Aberllefenni continued in use. Although locomotives were used <b>underground,</b> the <b>tramway</b> was operated by horse haulage. This continued {{until the early}} 1960s, when a tractor replaced the horses. The tramway was removed in the late 1970s, being replaced with lorries and forklift trucks.

5000|$|The Brussels Metro (Métro de Bruxelles, Brusselse metro) is a {{rapid transit}} system serving {{a large part}} of the Brussels-Capital Region of Belgium. It {{consists}} of four conventional metro lines and three premetro lines. The metro-grade lines are M1, M2, M5, and M6 with some shared sections, covering a total of 39.9 km, with 59 metro-only stations. The premetro network consists of three tram lines (T3, T4, and T7) that partly travel over underground sections that were intended to be eventually converted into metro lines. Underground stations in the premetro network use the same design as metro stations. A few short <b>underground</b> <b>tramway</b> sections exist, so there is a total of 52.0 km of underground metro and tram network. There are a total of 69 metro and premetro stations as of 2011.|$|E
50|$|The {{plans for}} a tunnel under the centre of Essen {{replacing}} an above-ground tram line began in 1961. Again, there were considerations of relieving the above-ground tramway and congestion in the quite small Essen inner city (about 1,400 × 700 metres), which suffered from increasing traffic. The initial solutions ranged similarly from the retention of the surface tramway {{with the creation of}} a new centralised node, up to the creation of a pure U-Bahn (metro) system as in Berlin and Hamburg. For various reasons, however, it was agreed to build an <b>underground</b> <b>tramway</b> with the possibility of future upgrade to a full U-Bahn. The idea of building a pure U-Bahn system at once was considered, but discarded due to the need to handle the existing passenger flows linking the tramway systems of the neighbouring cities of the Ruhr.|$|E
5000|$|Munich and Nuremberg {{decided to}} build pure, {{full-scale}} U-Bahn (metro) systems. Berlin and Hamburg planned expansions of their existing U-Bahn networks, while most West German cities decided to upgrade their tramway networks step by step, linking new 'second level' infrastructure to existing sections. While some cities regarded this solution as an interim step {{that would lead to}} a fully separated U-Bahn (metro) network independent of other forms of transport, others planned for a lesser degree of separation, one that would accommodate additional tram-like sections in the long run. For both the interim and the long-term based concepts, the following terms came into use: [...] "U-Straßenbahn" [...] or [...] "Untergrund-Straßenbahn" [...] (<b>underground</b> <b>tramway,</b> abbreviated as [...] "U-Strab"), [...] "Schnellstraßenbahn" [...] (rapid tramway) and finally Stadtbahn. (In French-speaking countries, these concepts were also known as [...] "pre-metro", stressing their interim nature.) ...|$|E
50|$|In {{line with}} most other bus {{operators}} in London, {{there was a}} significant drop in profit, and the Star Omnibus Company was unable to withstand the competition from the London <b>Underground</b> and the <b>tramway</b> services. The company was wound up on 21 February 1908.|$|R

To relieve congestion on the District line east of [...] from 1936 some trains from Hammersmith were diverted from the East London line to Barking. Through trains to New Cross and New Cross Gate were withdrawn in November 1939, the Hammersmith & City line trains terminating at Whitechapel while the longer 8-car Uxbridge line trains ran to Barking. However, this caused operational problems and from 1941 Barking was again served by trains from Hammersmith.|$|R
