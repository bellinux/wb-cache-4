5|$|Much of Fauré's piano {{music is}} {{difficult}} to play, but is rarely virtuosic in style. The composer disliked showy display, and the predominant characteristic of his piano music is a classical restraint and <b>understatement.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ian Chappell … always sweated on my blunders and {{reported}} {{them with an}} 'I told you so' mentality... To say Chappell's criticism irked me would be an <b>understatement,</b> though I knew that, like anyone, he was entitled to an opinion. I don't mind the fact he criticised me — in fact, I would much rather someone make a judgement than not, but I have always felt that a critic must be either constructive or base his comments on fact... It was something I had to live with, and when I realised he {{was never going to}} cut me much slack, I decided anything he said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just cast aside.|$|E

25|$|Unlike his father, Itzikl was a reticent sort, and did {{not deliver}} public discourses, as was common among other Hasidic rebbes. His successors {{generally}} did the same. The philosophy of general reticence and <b>understatement</b> in devotional behavior characteristic of Skver {{can be traced to}} this practice.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s the Duke Ellington Orchestra and the Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra were exposing {{the music world}} to harmonically {{sophisticated}} musical arrangements by Billy Strayhorn and Sy Oliver, respectively, which implied chords {{as much as they}} spelled them out. That <b>understatement</b> of harmonically sophisticated chords would soon be used by young musicians exploring the new musical language of bebop..|$|E
25|$|U.S. persons owning {{or having}} {{signatory}} authority of these foreign accounts or other specified financial assets must report {{them on a}} new IRS Form 8938, Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets, which is filed with the person's U.S. tax returns if the accounts are generally worth more than US$50,000; a higher reporting threshold applies to U.S. persons who are overseas residents and joint filers. Account holders {{would be subject to}} a 40% penalty on <b>understatements</b> of income in an undisclosed foreign financial asset. <b>Understatements</b> of greater than 25% of gross income are subject to an extended statute of limitations period of 6 years.

40|$|<b>Understatements</b> for two-channel fixed {{media is}} a four-movement {{study of the}} sonic {{potential}} of acoustic instruments within the practice of electroacoustic studio composition. The musical identity of the entire composition is achieved through consistent approaches to disparate instrumental materials and a focused investigation {{of the relationships between}} the various acoustic timbres and their electroacoustic treatments. The analytical section of this paper builds on contemporary research in electroacoustic arts. The analysis of the work is preceded by a summary of theoretical and aesthetic approaches within electroacoustic composition and the introduction of primary criteria of sonic faktura (material essence) used in the compositional process. The analyses address the idiosyncratic use of the concept of faktura to contextualize and guide the unfolding of the work. The reconciliation of the illusory electronic textures and the acoustic sources that parented them may be considered the ultimate goal of <b>Understatements...</b>|$|R

25|$|American {{composer}} John Philip Sousa {{revolutionized the}} march. His prolific production of quality marches {{added to the}} genre's popularity. According to Sousa researcher Paul Bierley, Sousa's marches were known for simplicity and <b>understatement,</b> with rousing counterpoint and overall energy. Sousa also {{is said to have}} standardized the traditional march form (see below.) His Stars and Stripes Forever is the official march of the United States.|$|E
25|$|To {{say that}} they have a key role to play is an <b>understatement.</b> Finance is {{connected}} to most, if not all, of the key business processes within the organization. It should be steering the stewardship and accountability systems that ensure that the organization is conducting its business in an appropriate, ethical manner. It is critical that these foundations are firmly laid. So often they are the litmus test by which public confidence in the institution is either won or lost.|$|E
25|$|Occupational {{exposure}} {{is an issue}} for some in the chemical industries, historically for those making chlorophenols or chlorophenoxy acid herbicides or {{in the application of}} chemicals, notably herbicides. In many developed nations there are now emissions regulations which have dramatically decreased the emissions and thus alleviated some concerns, although the lack of continuous sampling of dioxin emissions causes concern about the <b>understatement</b> of emissions. In Belgium, through the introduction of a process called AMESA, continuous sampling showed that periodic sampling understated emissions by a factor of 30 to 50 times. Few facilities have continuous sampling.|$|E

5000|$|Fei (which is {{no longer}} {{recognized}} as the adverb fein, finely) is a particle peculiar to Upper German dialects. It denotes that the speaker states something important {{that might be a}} surprise for the listener. To give an adequate translation even into Standard German is difficult; probably, the best try is to use <b>understatements</b> with strong affirmative meaning. In English, translations to [...] "I should think" [...] or [...] "just to mention" [...] seem possible, varying from context.|$|R
40|$|As it {{has already}} been said, Metel Ožegović was agalnst the policy of duallsm and {{strongly}} opposed the Croato-Hungarian Agreement / Treaty (1868) seelng in it numerous <b>understatements,</b> especially in relatlon to Croatian territorial integrity and independent financial sources. These <b>understatements</b> failed to be eliminated even after the Agreement had been unsuccessfully reconsidered in 1873. Metel Ožegović openly expressed his dlscord with duallst policy in Vienna newspaper Vaterland in 1868 and in an anonymously publlshed brochure of the same year in Vienna. The latter was entltled 2 ̆ 7 Old Union and New Agree¬ment of Croatia with Hungary-written by a Croat. (The original German headllne read: Der alte Verband und der neue Ausgleich Croetiens mit Ungarn-Von einem Croaten.) Shortly after that Metel Ožegović renounced politics and became patron of Croatian Vlenna-based students but also went on supporting Croatian cultural, educatlonal and economlc institutions of his homeland. He enjoyed great respect amongst the Croats because of his unselfish commltment to the natlon’s welfare. The fact that he recelved the freedom of honorary citizen from almost all major towns of Croatia proves that people recognlzed his efforts...|$|R
25|$|Circulation {{levels of}} cash {{on a per}} capita basis, are reduced by 19.5% from the high in 2007 to 2012; and reduced by 41.1% from 2007 to 2015. The Riksbanken {{predicted}} that between 2012 and 2020, the amount of cash in circulation will decline by 20 to 50 percent. The prediction {{may prove to be}} an <b>understatement</b> as the decline has exceeded 20 percent from 2012 to 2015. Speculation about Sweden declaring all banknotes and coins invalid at some future date is widespread in the media with Björn Ulvaeus as a celebrity advocate of a cashless Sweden which he believes will result in a safer society because simple robbery will involve stealing goods that must be fenced.|$|E
25|$|His parents, Margaret (née Metcalfe) and Arthur Jefferson, {{were both}} {{active in the}} theatre and always very busy. In his early years, the boy spent much time living with his {{maternal}} grandmother, Sarah Metcalfe. He attended school at King James I Grammar School, Bishop Auckland, County Durham and the King's School, Tynemouth, Northumberland. He moved with his parents to Glasgow, Scotland, where he completed his education at Rutherglen Academy. His father managed Glasgow's Metropole Theatre, where Laurel began work. His boyhood hero was Dan Leno, {{one of the greatest}} English music hall comedians. With a natural affinity for the theatre, Laurel gave his first professional performance on stage at the Panopticon in Glasgow at the age of sixteen, where he polished his skills at pantomime and music hall sketches. It was the music hall from where he drew his standard comic devices, including his bowler hat and nonsensical <b>understatement.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 5 August 2008, two {{pilots and}} seven firefighters {{assigned}} to the Iron Complex fire in California's Shasta-Trinity National Forest, were killed when Carson Helicopters S-61N N612AZ crashed on takeoff. Of the 13 people reportedly on board, one other pilot and three firefighters survived the crash with serious or critical injuries. The NTSB determined that the probable causes were the following actions by Carson Helicopters: 1) the intentional <b>understatement</b> of the helicopter’s empty weight, 2) the alteration of the power available chart to exaggerate lift capability, and 3) the use of unapproved above-minimum specification torque in performance calculations that, collectively, resulted in the pilots’ relying on performance calculations that significantly overestimated load-carrying capacity and without an adequate performance margin for a successful takeoff; and insufficient oversight by the U.S. Forest Service and the Federal Aviation Administration. Contributing factors were the flight crew's failure to address {{the fact that the}} helicopter had approached its maximum performance capability on two prior departures from the accident site as they were accustomed to operating at its performance limit. Contributing to the fatalities were the immediate, intense fire due to a fuel spillage upon impact from the fuel tanks that were not crash-resistant, the separation from the floor of the cabin seats that were not crash-resistant, and the use of an inappropriate release mechanism on the seat restraints.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} implications of using inappropriate distributions when modelling data sets with extreme data. It {{has been found that}} in practice it has been assumed that financial data follow a normal and T Distribution even in cases where these assumptions are inappropriate. Such assumptions when modelling extreme data can lead to gross <b>understatements</b> in risk estimates. The more suitable approach of EVT is introduced as a more prudent approach to model extreme risks. The research was facilitated by models built in EXCEL. Risk estimates derived from a Danish data set of insurance losses under the Normal, T and Generalised Pareto Distribution (EVT) were estimated and compared to determine the degree of error in making wrong distributions assumptions in risk modelling. The dissertation also discusses the usefulness of EVT in the context of regulatory capital charges and explores the limitations of the EVT approach through sensitivity testing. The Findings of the research highlight that financial institutions are set to incur significant <b>understatements</b> in risk estimates if traditional Normal and T distributions are used as the basis of modelling data with extremes. EVT is considered a necessary complement to existing internal and regulatory risk measurement processes...|$|R

50|$|Duchin had {{no formal}} music training—which {{was said to}} {{frustrate}} his musicians at times—but he developed a style rooted in classical music that some saw as the forerunner of Liberace's ornate, gaudy approach. Still, there were <b>understatements</b> in Duchin's music. By no means was Duchin a perfect pianist, but he was easy to listen to without being rote or entirely predictable. He was a pleasing stage presence whose favourite technique was to play his piano cross-handed, using only one finger on the lower hand, and he was respectful to his audiences and to his classical influences.|$|R
30|$|As {{summarized}} by Harlan (1992), Vavilov believed that “the geographic region {{in which one}} found the greatest genetic diversity was the region of origin.” Within each of these centers lay not only the origins of our food crops, but other sources of diversity that included plant species not cultivated but related to a certain crop, and other species that were far more distant in their genetic makeup. To say this idea and recognition were new, or {{to say they were}} a breakthrough would be gross <b>understatements.</b> Instead, these theories were genius, coming from Vavilov’s tireless curiosity and bravery, never being afraid to question himself, always searching the corners of the globe for insight and evidence.|$|R
30|$|Hence, it is {{prudent to}} call for better {{practices}} to assess losses and damages from disasters in relative terms. The first option is to identify those in need based on households’ estimate of the losses incurred and their annual income. The risk of incentivizing overstatements of loss and damage, however, as well as <b>understatements</b> of income may make this approach less desirable. Moreover, estimating household income in rural areas of developing countries is notoriously difficult (Greeley 1994). Instead, using locally validated proxies of wealth or a multidimensional vulnerability index (van der Geest and Warner 2015) could be more accurate and reliable. This also could be a relatively simple way to improve the adequacy of compensation payouts and relief distributions.|$|R
