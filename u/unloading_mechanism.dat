In manual treadmill training the therapists provide assistance to facilitate an upright posture and a normal stepping pattern. Therapist assistance may be provided at the patient’s pelvis, leg and foot, and a third therapist controlling the treadmill settings. In robotic-assisted treadmill training, a device replaces the need for therapists to assist the patient in generating a normal stepping pattern. Currently, there are three different models available: Hocoma's Lokomat, the HealthSouth AutoAmbulator, and the Mechanized Gait Trainer II. The Lokomat is a driven gait orthosis that consists of a computer -controlled exoskeleton that secured to the patient’s legs while being supported over a treadmill. In addition to a belt driven treadmill and an overhead lift, the HealthSouth AutoAmbulator also includes a pair of articulated arms (that drives the hip and knee joints) and two upright structures that house the computer controls and body-weight <b>unloading</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Unlike the first two, the Mechanized Gait Trainer II does not work {{in conjunction with a}} treadmill; instead it is based on a crank and rocker gear system which provides limb motion similar to an elliptical trainer. Robotic-assisted treadmill training was developed with three goals in mind: 1. to decrease therapist physical demand and time, 2. to improve repeatability of step kinematics, and 3. to increase volume of locomotor training.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Agus M. Ramdhan The Lower Kutai Basin is a Tertiary {{sedimentary}} basin {{located on the}} eastern coast of Kalimantan, Indonesia, underlying {{the area around the}} Mahakam Delta. Concerning overpressuring, previous workers agreed that the principal mechanism of overpressure generation is disequilibrium compaction, with sand–mudrock pressure discrepancies being present above the transition zone into hard overpressure as a result of lateral reservoir drainage. 	The pressure data, wireline logs and other data such as temperature and vitrinite reflectance data have been re-examined to analyse the overpressuring in this area. <b>Unloading</b> <b>mechanisms</b> have been considered as alternatives to disequilibrium compaction. The reasons for doing so are the high temperatures in this basin, which promote <b>unloading</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> together with some evidence ignored by previous researchers, from wireline log and vitrinite reflectance data, that also suggest <b>unloading</b> <b>mechanisms</b> play an important role. 	Clear evidence of unloading has been found in the form of trend reversals in sonic and resistivity logs, without coincident reversals in density logs, and of substantial chemical compaction with mudrock densities exceeding 2. 6 g/cm 3 at the top of overpressure. In the Peciko Field, a field located in the shelfal area of the basin, mudrock density continues to increase with depth in the overpressured section. All these circumstances are in conflict with the disequilibrium compaction hypothesis; instead, the mudrocks are inferred to be overcompacted. 	The top of the transition zone into hard overpressure coincides with the onset of gas generation indicating that the gas generation is the principal cause of unloading. Chemical compaction processes must also be ongoing in the overpressured zone, including illitization of mixed layer illite-smectite, illitization of kaolinite, and quartz dissolution and reprecipitation. 	The result of this research is novel and possibly controversial: there is no other Neogene basin where the role of disequilibrium compaction in overpressure generation has been discounted. ...|$|R

50|$|In {{the event}} that the {{unloader}} mechanism becomes plugged, the farmer must climb the silo and directly stand on the unloader, reaching into the blower spout to dig out the soft silage. After clearing a plug, the forage needs to be forked out into an even layer around the unloader so that the unloader does not immediately dig into the pile and plug itself again. All during this process the farmer is standing on or near a machine that could easily kill them in seconds if it were to accidentally start up.

50|$|The {{two main}} {{problems}} which will necessitate silo cleaning in dry-matter silos and bins are bridging and rat-holing. Bridging {{occurs when the}} material interlaces over the <b>unloading</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{at the base of}} the silo and blocks the flow of stored material by gravity into the unloading system. Rat-holing occurs when the material starts to adhere to the side of the silo. This will reduce the operating capacity of a silo as well as leading to cross-contamination of newer material with older material. There are a number of ways to clean a silo and many of these carry their own risks. However, since the early 1990s acoustic cleaners have become available. These are non-invasive, have minimum risk, and can offer a very cost-effective way to keep a small particle silo clean.|$|E

40|$|Long-distance water {{transport}} in plants relies on negative pressures established in continuous water columns in xylem conduits. Water under tension is in a metastable state and {{is prone to}} cavitation and embolism, which leads to loss of hydraulic conductance, reduced productivity and eventually plant death. Experimental evidence suggests that plants can repair embolized xylem by pushing water from living vessel-associated cells into the gas-filled conduit lumina. Most surprisingly, embolism refilling is known to occur even when the bulk of still functioning xylem is under tension, a finding that is in seemingly contradiction to basic principles of thermodynamics. This review summarizes our current understanding of xylem refilling processes and speculates that embolism repair under tension can be envisioned as a particular case of phloem unloading, as suggested by several events and components of embolism repair, typically involved in phloem <b>unloading</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Far from being a challenge to irreversible thermodynamics, embolism refilling is emerging as a finely regulated vital process essential for plant functioning under different environmental stresses...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} that cause overpressure can be broadly classified into two categories: loading and unloading. This study looks at eight wells from the deepwater Niger Delta; the wells were evaluated with three aims in mind. The first {{aim was to}} determine shale pore pressure with the density log using the equivalent depth approach. The second aim, using depth profiles of density, velocity, resistivity, and vertical effective stress, and cross-plots, was to infer the overpressure mechanism. The third aim was to validate underbalanced drilling zones identified on the pressure-depth plot with indications observed on the drilling report, mudlog, and other post-drilling data. To discriminate clean shales intervals, a density-velocity transform based on Gardner’s (1974) relationship and GR filters were applied to the well logs. Measured pore pressures, log data, temperature data, drilling data, and mudlog data, including the end-of-well-report, were analysed for selected wells. Based on pressure-depth plots, the top of overpressure in the wells lies in the range 500 – 1200 TVDml. The equivalent depth method using the density log, when properly calibrated with measured pore pressures, can give reliable pressure prediction results, especially in the shallow section at temperatures 75 °C, the equivalent depth method is unreliable. It was also noted that shale intervals may provide vertical permeability barriers and create pressure compartments {{in some of the}} wells. The predominant overpressuring mechanism in the shallow section, as evident from density and velocity reversals and, was found to be disequilibrium compaction. At greater depths (temperatures > 75 °C), a combination of disequilibrium compaction and <b>unloading</b> <b>mechanisms</b> appears to be responsible for overpressure in the wells. Evidence for <b>unloading</b> <b>mechanisms</b> includes formation temperatures of 80 °C or greater, indications of smectite-to-illite conversion on density-sonic cross-plots, rapid increases in mud weight that sometimes approached fracture gradient, and depressed density reversals relative to velocity reversals. Finally, intervals identified as being drilled underbalanced on pressure-depth plots are consistent with drilling data, mudlog data, and information in the end-of-well reports. Specifically, increased gas (connection gas and background gas), hole washout, high torque, drilling break, and decreased D-exponent trend show strong association with zones of underbalanced drilling on pressure-depth plots...|$|R

Though photosynthate import and unloading were significantly reduced by perfusion, measurements of photosynthate fluxes in perfused seed coats proved {{useful for the}} study of <b>unloading</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in vivo. Phloem import was stimulated by lowered seed coat cell turgor, as demonstrated by an increase in tracer and sucrose import to seed coats perfused with high concentrations of an osmoticum. The partitioning of photosynthates between retention in the seed coat and release to the perfusion solution also was turgor sensitive; increases in seed coat cell turgor stimulated photosynthate release to the apoplast at the expense of photosynthate retention within the seed coat. There was no evidence of a turgor-sensitive sucrose uptake mechanism in perfused seed coats. Thus, the turgor sensitivity of photosynthate partitioning within perfused seed coats was consistent with a turgor-sensitive efflux control mechanism.

To answer the question of whether SUT 1 serves a function in phloem unloading in tubers, the promoter was fused to gusA and expression was analyzed in transgenic potato. SUT 1 expression was unexpectedly detected not in tuber parenchyma but in the phloem of sink tubers. Immunolocalization demonstrated that StSUT 1 protein was present only in sieve elements of sink tubers, cells normally involved in export of Suc from the phloem to supply developing tubers, raising the question of the role of SUT 1 in tubers. SUT 1 expression was inhibited by antisense in transgenic potato plants using a class I patatin promoter B 33, which is primarily expressed in the phloem of developing tubers. Reduced SUT 1 expression in tubers did not affect aboveground organs but led to reduced fresh weight accumulation during early stages of tuber development, indicating that in this phase SUT 1 plays an important role for sugar transport. Changes in Suc- and starch-modifying enzyme activities and metabolite profiles are consistent with the developmental switch in <b>unloading</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Altogether, the findings may suggest a role of SUT 1 in retrieval of Suc from the apoplasm, thereby regulating the osmotic potential in the extracellular space, or a direct role in phloem unloading acting as a phloem exporter transferring Suc from the sieve elements into the apoplasm.

40|$|This program {{demonstrated}} the technical feasibility of constructing large-stroke magnetic suspensions that {{can meet the}} active vibration isolation requirements of Space Station. These requirements include: (1) strokes over 1 cm in all directions, (2) actuator bandwidths over 100 Hz, (3) isolator roll-off frequencies below 10 (exp - 2) Hertz, and (4) force capability over 1 Newton in all axes. The 100 Hz actuator bandwidth allows the suspension to reject any direct force disturbances that act on the microgravity experiment, for example forces created by cable connections. The low isolator roll-off frequency and large stroke allow the magnetic suspension to isolate the microgravity experiment from Space Station vibrations above the roll-off frequency. The capability to meet these requirements was demonstrated by designing, constructing and testing a six-degree-of-freedom, prototype magnetic suspension system that featured high-performance, Lorentz-force actuators and full multi-input, multi-output control. This prototype suspension is designed to isolate large orbiter locker experiments under typical spacecraft constraints of size, weight, and power. Suspension in the full six-degrees-of-freedom was successfully demonstrated in this program while using a gravity-force <b>unload</b> <b>mechanism</b> to simulate a space environment. The prototype isolator is capable of space-based isolation service with relatively minor modification.

Identified pathologies of structures vary depending on these situations. In {{the context of a}} shallow tunnel, the tunnel excavation leads to a slope destabilization due to a more or less important deconfinement of the surrounding massif. Construction techniques influence, on one hand, slope surface displacement acceleration, on the other hand, structural damages in the tunnel lining. Nevertheless, the interaction between tunnel and unstable slope depends on the distance between the slope surface and the tunnel lining plot according to the tunnel diameter (D) and on the geological, geomorphological, hydrological and seismic contexts of the slope. This research focises on different mechanisms of slope instability in a glacial unloading context, especially in creeping contexts, and on damages affecting the structure of tunnels parallel to the slope.

Many kinds of defects including pores, preexisting fractures, and soft inclusions were found in the undamaged Apache Leap tuff samples. Pores were determined to be the main microstructures in Topopah Spring tuff that could influence the mechanical and hydrologic properties. Under compressive stresses, microcracking initiates from some of the pores. These microcracks will interact and coalescence to form large microcracks or macroscopic cracks as the load is increased. Crack propagation phenomena, such as pore cracking, pore linking, pore collapse and the formation of en echelon arrays were all found in specimens unloaded prior to complete failure. The failure of tuff specimens is often through a process of shear localization. In summary, the deformation and failure of both tuffs occurred by progressive fracturing, starting from microcracking on the small scale, and ending as fractures coalesced to form macroscopic fractures and shear localization. On the basis of the experimental studies, micromechanical models such as the pore collapse model and the pore linking model have been developed based on fracture mechanics theory. These models are used to predict the constitutive behavior for tuff and the predicted stress-strain curves match well with the experimental curves...|$|R
40|$|Geometric and {{thermodynamic}} {{simulations of}} a twin screw compressor {{were carried out}} to determine the flows through the suction and discharge ports, and to calculate the compressor performance. As flows through ports are oscillatory in nature, gas pulsations are excited in the suction and discharge manifolds. The thermodynamic activity and the gas pulsation {{interact with each other}} during the process. Gas pulsations not only alter the gas conditions inside the compression chamber and thus change the performance of the compressor, but also cause the compressor structure to vibrate and radiate noise. ^ The acoustic characteristics of the suction and discharge manifolds were described in terms of pressure and volume flow transfer functions. The fundamental physics of gas oscillation was studied by use of a lumped parameter model and a one-dimensional continuous model. However a finite element model was employed in this research to deal with the complicated geometry and large size of the three-dimensional enclosure of a real screw compressor. ^ Results of the mathematical modeling and computer simulation, were checked against the measured data and showed good agreement. Influences of gas pulsation on the compressor performance and the vibration and noise generation were studied. These studies included the calculation of the natural frequencies of the compressor shell and measurements of the acceleration and noise spectra. Acoustic properties of the steel wool demister in the discharge manifold were also measured and their influence was studied. Effects of the over/under pressure condition and the volume ratio <b>unloading</b> <b>mechanism</b> on the compressor performance and gas pulsation were investigated. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{large part}} of the grain {{produced}} in the South Urals has high humidity and needs to be dried before storage. Drying is an energy-intensive process and is about 70 % of the total energy consumption for post-harvest processing of grain. Modern grain drying equip¬ment, implements high-convection drying, and heat provides cost 5 350 – 5 500 kJ per 1 kg of evaporated moisture, which is well above the theoretical calculations. Combined drying, which involves high-temperature drying step and aeration enables to reduce heat costs up to 30 %. To control the combined drying process it is necessary that final grain moisture relates to such parameters of high-temperature drying and aeration as the initial moisture content, the temperature of grain and the time subsequent aering. The paper describes the said relation as a mathematical model of the second order obtained experi¬mentally for wheat. The model has been derived from the implementation of Box-Benkin plan for three factors – the initial grain moisture, temperature and time of grain heating and aering. The experiment was conducted for a 200 mm thick fixed grain bed. We also have got a model relating energy consumption to the said parameters. The model of the final grain moisture within the variation of factors can be used to create a control algorithm for combined drying. Taking as the set parameters final moisture, initial moisture and grain heating temperature, a microcontroller calculates the time for active aering necessary to obtain final grain moisture and an <b>unloading</b> <b>mechanism</b> provides the necessary time through regulating the discharge rate. The model makes it possible to calculate the energy usage for drying at different values of initial moisture, temperature and time of grain heating and aering...|$|E
40|$|This thesis reports {{experimental}} and theoretical analyses {{to study the}} heat generation and partition between contacting bodies under rolling/sliding elastohydrodynamic (EHL) point contact. A twin disk test rig was re-commissioned and used for the experimental work. 76 mm diameter crowned, super-finished test disks, fixed on parallel shafts, {{were used in the}} experimental EHL tests. In each disk, 6 thermocouples were installed to measure the temperature during sliding/rolling contact under EHL conditions. In addition, ceramic washers were fixed on the plane sides of each disk to minimize heat transfer over those surfaces. A Labview data acquisition system was built for acquiring data from the sensors installed on the rig. The EHL experimental results show the fast disk has significantly higher bulk temperature than the slow disk. A transient two dimensional numerical model was constructed to calculate the average circumferential temperature distribution within the disks using three thermocouples as a boundary condition. The heat partition factor, , and convection heat transfer coefficient, h, were varied systematically in the model. A linear relationship between  and hf for the fast disk and 1 - and hs for the slow disk were obtained. These two linear relations were related together by the variation of h with the rotational speed. Over the approximately steady state condition, the calculated  using this approach was in the range of 0. 65 to 0. 77 for 32 EHL tests at different loads and sliding speeds. This means that the majority of heat is conducted to the fast disk, which is compatible with the previous findings. In order to carry out transient modelling, the <b>unloading</b> <b>mechanism</b> was developed to ensure rapid disk separation. This improved the temperature trend in the cooling phase. In addition, a microswitch was used to give accurate monitoring of the disks contacting and separation. The thermocouple arrangement within the disks and their installation technique were assessed and developed. An immersion test in a hot oil bath was used to test the thermocouples dynamic response. This test was modelled, and the results showed significant lag in the measurements. It was concluded that a system identification method is required to identify the dynamic characteristics of the temperature measurement system in order to compensate for time lagging Extensive studies were carried out to determine the cause behind some of the experimental uncertainties. It was found that the most likely reason behind these uncertainties is the contact pressure variation along the disk-shaft interference fit, which would result in significant thermal conductance variation. The traction force measurement within the EHL contacts has shown broadly linear increase with increased load at constant sliding speed. This indicates a constant coefficient of friction at constant sliding speed. The results also showed that the coefficient of friction decreases as the sliding speed increases...|$|E

40|$|The Delaware Basin, part of {{the larger}} Permian Basin, {{contains}} important hydrocarbon plays. Permian strata contain 71 % of in-place oil and 53 % of in-place gas, with the remainder hosted in the Lower Palaeozoic. Excessive pore fluid pressures (up to 〜 8000 psi above hydrostatic) are found within Early Permian and Pennsylvanian strata, which account for 30 - 35 % of the hydrocarbon producing zones. This study has utilised an array of basin analysis techniques to analyse the pressure history of the Delaware basin. To fully appreciate the geopressure history in the Delaware Basin, a rigorous quantitative approach has been applied using advanced thermochronology techniques. This has enabled for the first time an accurate burial history curve to be established for the basin. The results show that maximum burial occurred in the basin at 55 Ma as a consequence of an additional 6890 ft of Mesozoic and Cenozoic sediment. The basin then underwent two major tectonic uplift events during the Cenozoic. The Laramide orogeny (55 - 50 Ma) uplifted and eroded off 3890 ft of sediment, then during the Eocene and Oligocene the basin subsided and accumulated a further 600 ft of sediment. The Basin and Range event (25 - 10 Ma) then uplifted and tilted the basin further, eroding off 3600 ft of sediment from the centre of the basin. The new burial history curve has been integrated with wireline logs and basin modelling software to evaluate the mechanism of overpressure generation and its maintenance through geological time. This study has shown that the main mechanism for overpressure generation in the Delaware Basin was disequilibrium compaction. Analysis of the sonic log using the Equivalent Depth Method and the Eaton Ratio Method, combined with velocity I density cross-plots, indicate that compaction is driven by vertical loading, and undercompaction seen in the basin is a consequence of the sediments' inability to dewater. Basin modelling shows that it was the rapid deposition of the Permian sediments that enabled disequilibrium compaction to generate overpressure. These techniques have also shown that a secondary cause of overpressure due to <b>unloading</b> <b>mechanisms</b> (e. g. gas generation or expansion with uplift, lateral transfer and hydrocarbon buoyancy) may be occurring within localised horizons below the Wolfcampian Series. Overpressure has been maintained within the basin for more than 250 Myr. Basin modelling and wireline logs have shown that numerous intercalated tight limestones (Mississippian to Late Permian) acted as pressure seals to maintain overpressure. In addition, low permeability mudstones (l 0 (^- 6) mD) have contributed to the inability of the Delaware Basin to reach pressure equilibrium.

40|$|Despite {{rigorous}} {{exercise and}} nutritional management during space missions, astronauts returning from microgravity exhibit neuromuscular deficits {{and a significant}} loss in muscle mass in the postural muscles of the lower leg. Similar changes in the postural muscles occur in subjects participating in long-duration bed rest studies. These adaptive muscle changes manifest as a reduction in reflex conduction velocity during head-down bed rest. Because the stretch reflex encompasses both the peripheral (muscle spindle and nerve axon) and central (spinal synapse) components involved in adaptation to calf muscle unloading, it {{may be used to}} provide feedback on the general condition of neuromuscular function, and might be used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} countermeasures aimed at preserving muscle mass and function during periods of unloading. Stretch reflexes were measured on 18 control subjects who spent 60 to 90 days in continuous 6 deg head-down bed rest. Using a motorized system capable of rotating the foot around the ankle joint (dorsiflexion) through an angle of 10 degrees at a peak velocity of about 250 deg/sec, a stretch reflex was recorded from the subject's left triceps surae muscle group. Using surface electromyography, about 300 reflex responses were obtained and ensemble-averaged on 3 separate days before bed rest, 3 to 4 times in bed, and 3 times after bed rest. The averaged responses for each test day were examined for reflex latency and conduction velocity (CV) across gender. Computerized posturography was also conducted on these same subjects before and after bed rest as part of the standard measures. Peak-to-peak sway was measured during Sensory Organization Tests (SOTs) to evaluate changes in the ability to effectively use or suppress visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive information for postural control. Although no gender differences were found, a significant increase in reflex latency and a significant decrease in CV were observed during the bed rest period, with a return to baseline 3 to 5 days after bed rest, depending on the duration of bed rest. In addition, a relationship between CV and loss of muscle strength in the lower leg was observed post bed rest for most subjects. Immediately post-bed rest, most subjects showed decreased performance on SOTs, with the greater decrements on sway-referenced support and head movement conditions. Post-bed rest decrements were less than typically observed following spaceflight. Decrements in postural control and the stretch reflex can be primarily attributed to the <b>unloading</b> <b>mechanisms</b> this ground-based analog provides. The stretch reflex is a concise test measurement that can be obtained during the head-down phase of bed rest, as it does not interfere with the bed rest paradigm. This makes it an ideal tool that can detect, early on, whether a countermeasure is successful in preserving muscle function...|$|R
