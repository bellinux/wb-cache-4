500|$|Alley {{attempted}} to remove Kouandété from the army, though to no avail. In any case, by June his fellow officers had made <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>mind</b> {{as to the}} next president. After talks with unionists, civil servants, and academics, they [...] "entrust the reins of power to Émile Derlin Zinsou {{for at least five}} years", who was [...] "charged to form a government of national union", as per a June 28 newspaper article by the state press. On July 17, Alley handed power to Zinsou, a veteran politician.|$|E
2500|$|Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) stated {{shortly after}} the {{meetings}} that [...] "I think, {{if you were to}} hold the vote today, she would not get a majority, either in the Judiciary Committee or on the floor." [...] However, Specter, the committee chairman, rejected the notion that Miers' nomination was shaky. He said that most senators were waiting for the hearings before making <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>mind.</b> [...] "There are no votes one way or another," [...] he said on CBS' Face the Nation. On October 19, 2005, Specter and Leahy announced their intent to begin confirmation hearings for Miers on November 7, 2005.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 November, Churchill {{returned}} to the topic. Speaking in the Address in Reply debate, after giving some specific instances of Germany's war preparedness, he said [...] "The Government simply cannot make <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>mind</b> or they cannot get the Prime Minister to make up his mind. So they go on in strange paradox, decided only to be undecided, resolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity, all powerful for impotency. And so we go on preparing more months more years precious perhaps vital for the greatness of Britain for the locusts to eat." [...] Robert Rhodes James called this one of Churchill's most brilliant speeches during this period, Baldwin's reply sounding weak and disturbing the House. The exchange gave new encouragement to the Arms and the Covenant Movement.|$|E
60|$|Laban was {{for trying}} {{a long shot}} at him, but father stopped him, {{saying that it was}} evident the whites had not made <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> {{what they were going to}} do with us, and that a shot at Lee might hurry them into making <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> the wrong way.|$|R

2500|$|Connolly {{has stated}} {{in the past that}} he disapproves of Scottish independence. [...] In 1974 he made a party {{political}} television broadcast on behalf of the Labour Party, which criticised and blasted the Scottish National Party. In 1999 he blamed the SNP for a supposed increase in [...] "anti-English racism" [...] in Scotland, called the new Scottish Parliament a [...] "joke", and declined to attend the opening. Although he now claims to disapprove of entertainers telling people how to vote, he admitted that 2012 had been [...] "a very interesting time for Scotland". Although he has chosen not to live in Scotland for most of his adult life, he questioned the expense of independence, and whether average Scots would benefit from another level of government. [...] "But Scots are very capable of making <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>mind</b> without my tuppence worth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Robert Aumann, {{a notable}} game theorist and {{winner of the}} Nobel Prize in Economics in 2005, has {{followed}} the Bible Code research and controversy for many years. He wrote: [...] "Though the basic thesis of the research seems wildly improbable, for many years I thought that an ironclad case had been made for the codes; I did not see how 'cheating' could have been possible. Then came {{the work of the}} 'opponents' (see, for example, McKay, Bar-Natan, Bar-Hillel and Kalai, Statistical Science 14 (1999), 149–173). Though this work did not convince me that the data had been manipulated, it did convince me that it could have been; that manipulation was technically possible.

6000|$|... "Indeed, and I don't. If the French and the Dons {{have made}} <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>mind</b> {{to take this}} place, and once set to fairly to do it, they are bound to stick to it for a bit. I should say you ought to provide for three years." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{there must}} have been a good many," [...] the settler agreed, [...] "but not so many, perhaps, as you would think.

60|$|At the {{beginning}} of the day there were no signs of it. The sky was blue and free from all suggestions of approaching thunderbolts.

60|$|So I {{returned}} with my answer, whereat Barung {{smiled and said}} nothing. Only, taking from his neck a gold chain which he wore, he proffered it to Quick, who, as he said, had induced the prince Joshua to show his horsemanship if not his courage.
