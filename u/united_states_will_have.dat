25|$|It is {{estimated}} that 1 in 25,000 babies born in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> some form of the mucopolysaccharidoses. It is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that only individuals inheriting the defective gene from both parents are affected. (The exception is MPS II, or Hunter syndrome, in which the mother alone passes along the defective gene to a son.) When both people in a couple have the defective gene, each pregnancy carries with it a one in four chance that the child will be affected. The parents and siblings of an affected child may have {{no sign of the}} disorder. Unaffected siblings and select relatives of a child with one of the mucopolysaccharidoses may carry the recessive gene and could pass it to their own children.|$|E

[...] "Consider what is likely to happen if we don't [...] Take, for instance, the impact of just one age-related disorder, Alzheimer disease (AD).
