25|$|While {{navigating}} the Elbe about eight miles above Brunsbuttel {{she was given}} permission to proceed until Cuxhaven {{at the mouth of}} the North Sea. There was no pilot ship available to take her through the minefield at Cuxhaven so she attempted to proceed on her own along the <b>usual</b> <b>channel.</b> Tugboat men of the harbour tried to warn San Wilfridos master about the danger by shouting. The master then tried to evade the mines by attempting to go full speed astern. However, at approximately four p.m., a strong ebb tide carried San Wilfrido into the mines. Three explosions followed and crippled the ship making it the first British naval loss of the war. A German tug took the crew away and made them prisoners.|$|E

It had been {{delivered}} {{to him in the}} street, not by the <b>usual</b> <b>channel,</b> but by a blue-coated serving-man. Two or three days later Humfrey had told him of Langston's interview with Walsingham, which he had at the time laughed to scorn, thinking himself able to penetrate any disguise of that Proteus, and likewise believing that he was blinding Walsingham.|$|E

60|$|In the {{catalogue}} of crimes provided against {{by the laws}} of Harley College, that of tavern-haunting was one of the principal. The secluded situation of the seminary, indeed, gave its scholars but a very limited choice of vices; and this was, therefore, the <b>usual</b> <b>channel</b> by which the wildness of youth discharged itself. Edward Walcott, though naturally temperate, had been not an unfrequent offender in this respect, for which a superfluity both of time and money might plead some excuse. But, since his acquaintance with Ellen Langton, he had rarely entered Hugh Crombie's doors; and an interruption in that acquaintance was the cause of his present appearance there.|$|E
60|$|That {{force had}} been got {{together}} with an alacrity which has seldom been equalled. On the 28th of July, we were, in Nelson's own words, literally at the foundation of our fabric of defence, and twelve days afterwards we were so prepared on the enemy's coast {{that he did not}} believe they could get three miles from their ports. The MEDUSA, returning to our own shores, anchored in the rolling ground off Harwich; and when Nelson wished to get to the Nore in her, the wind rendered it impossible to proceed there by the <b>usual</b> <b>channel.</b> In haste to be at the Nore, remembering that he had been a tolerable pilot for the mouth of the Thames in his younger days, and thinking it necessary that he should know all that could be known of the navigation, he requested the maritime surveyor of the coast, Mr. Spence, to get him into the Swin by any channel; for neither the pilots which he had on board, nor the Harwich ones, would take charge of the ship. No vessel drawing more than fourteen feet had ever before ventured over the Naze. Mr. Spence, however, who had surveyed the channel, carried her safely through. The channel has since been called Nelson's, though he himself wished it to be named after the MEDUSA: his name needed no new memorial.|$|E
60|$|Mac-Murrough, {{the family}} bhairdh, an aged man, {{immediately}} took the hint, {{and began to}} chant, with low and rapid utterance, a profusion of Celtic verses, which were received by the audience with all the applause of enthusiasm. As he advanced in his declamation, his ardour seemed to increase. He had at first spoken with {{his eyes fixed on}} the ground; he now cast them around as if beseeching, and anon as if commanding, attention, and his tones rose into wild and impassioned notes, accompanied with appropriate gestures. He seemed to Edward, who attended to him with much interest, to recite many proper names, to lament the dead, to apostrophise the absent, to exhort, and entreat, and animate those who were present. Waverley thought he even discerned his own name, and was convinced his conjecture was right from the eyes of the company being at that moment turned towards him simultaneously. The ardour of the poet appeared to communicate itself to the audience. Their wild and sun-burnt countenances assumed a fiercer and more animated expression; all bent forward towards the reciter, many sprung up and waved their arms in ecstasy, and some laid their hands on their swords. When the song ceased, there was a deep pause, while the aroused feelings of the poet and of the hearers gradually subsided into their <b>usual</b> <b>channel.</b>|$|E

60|$|Soon {{after the}} 55th {{appeared}} on the frontiers, Muir had volunteered his services to the enemy. In making his offers, he boasted of his intimacy with Lundie, and of the means it afforded of furnishing more accurate and important information than usual. His terms had been accepted, and Monsieur Sanglier had several interviews {{with him in the}} vicinity of the fort at Oswego, and had actually passed one entire night secreted in the garrison. Arrowhead, however, was the <b>usual</b> <b>channel</b> of communication; and the anonymous letter to Major Duncan had been originally written by Muir, transmitted to Frontenac, copied, and sent back by the Tuscarora, who was returning from that errand when captured by the Scud. It is scarcely necessary to add that Jasper was to be sacrificed in order to conceal the Quartermaster's treason, and that the position of the island had been betrayed to the enemy by the latter. An extraordinary compensation--that which was found in his purse--had induced him to accompany the party under Sergeant Dunham, in order to give the signals that were to bring on the attack. The disposition of Muir towards the sex was a natural weakness, and he would have married Mabel, or any one else who would accept his hand; but his admiration of her was in a great degree feigned, in order that he might have an excuse for accompanying the party without sharing in the responsibility of its defeat, or incurring the risk of having no other strong and seemingly sufficient motive. Much of this was known to Captain Sanglier, particularly the part in connection with Mabel, and he did not fail to let his auditors into the whole secret, frequently laughing in a sarcastic manner, as he revealed the different expedients of the luckless Quartermaster.|$|E

5000|$|There {{is a large}} {{anthropomorphic}} {{figure in}} the landscape at Gundagai. The figure has a kangaroo or dog like head and is several kilometres in length. It has hindquarters {{similar to that of}} an emu but with a long tail and it appears to be sitting on a bend in the river that has a box shape [...] The image faces to the west and its head is near the Dog on the Tuckerbox area at Gundagai. This primary landscape figure marked out by the course of the Murrumbidgee River at Gundagai, is replicated in some Sydney Rock Engravings and recorded in local Aboriginal cultural heritage. The 'Gundagai' placename meaning further refers to the reason for the bend in the Murrumbidgee River near the Gundagai showground at Gundagai and to the mythological landscape epic at Gundagai. Bunyips, understood to be where streams flood out of their <b>usual</b> <b>channel</b> in wet seasons flooding surrounding land but also drowning anyone caught {{on the wrong side of}} them, are recorded on the Gundagai floodplain; opposite 'Kimo'; and at the junction of the Tumut and Murrumbidgee rivers.

30|$|Having an {{accurate}} and fast model {{to be used}} in device simulators is one of the future challenges for simulating carbon nanotube metalâoxideâsemiconductor (MOS) transistors. In this regard, there have been many works, most of which have paid attention to ballistic conditions [1, 2, 3] and some have considered non-ballistic conditions as well [4, 5]. Since the mean free path of electrons moving at carbon nanotubes is about 0.6 micron, which is much more than the <b>usual</b> <b>channel</b> length of carbon nanotube transistors, the assumption of ballistic transport is usually used in these transistors [6].|$|E
