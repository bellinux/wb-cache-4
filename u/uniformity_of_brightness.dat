40|$|Abstract. An optical design {{concept is}} {{presented}} {{for a wide}} field of view camera, used {{to take pictures of}} a model board, which are displayed to the pilot of a simulated aircraft in real time. The concept achieves mapping functions and perspectives in three separate images that match the dis-play system properties over 140 deg field of view. This enables fast feedback of the model board images to the pilot by avoiding the need for computer correction of optical distortion. The geometry of the lens system also ensures good <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> <b>brightness</b> over the wide field of view. The provision of three axes of angular movement and computer optical design techniques are discussed. The general design and fabrication of a prototype is described.

40|$|AbstractWe studied defragmented image based autostereoscopic 3 D {{displays}} with dynamic eye tracking. Specifically, {{we examined}} the impact of parallax barrier (PB) angular orientation on their image quality. The 3 D display system required fine adjustment of PB angular orientation {{with respect to a}} display panel. This was critical for both image color balancing and minimizing image resolution mismatch between horizontal and vertical directions. For evaluating <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> image <b>brightness,</b> we applied optical ray tracing simulations. The simulations took effects of PB orientation misalignment into account. The simulation results were then compared with recorded experimental data. Our optimal simulated system produced significantly enhanced image uniformity at around sweet spots in viewing zones. However this was contradicted by real experimental results. We offer quantitative treatment <b>of</b> illuminance <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> view images to estimate misalignment of PB orientation, which could account for brightness non-uniformity observed experimentally. Our study also shows that slight imperfection in the adjustment of PB orientation due to practical restrictions of adjustment accuracy can induce substantial non-uniformity <b>of</b> view images’ <b>brightness.</b> We find that image brightness non-uniformity critically depends on misalignment of PB angular orientation, for example, as slight as ≤ 0. 01 ° in our system. This reveals that reducing misalignment of PB angular orientation from the order of 10 − 2 to 10 − 3 degrees can greatly improve the brightness uniformity...|$|R

This airborne multispectral digital imaging system, manufactured acid operated by Positive Systems, Inc., consists of four digital cameras and an on-board digital capture system, Sensor lab tests of the digital cameras were conducted to determine spatial <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> image <b>brightness,</b> high frequency noise and signal-noise ratio (S/N), linearity of radiometric response, spectral response, and radiometric normalization and calibration, Submeter resolution ADAR 5500 data were acquired over constructed and natural coastal marshes, concurrent with ground-level radiometric and plant measurements, ADAR 5500 data were found to have high radiometric fidelity and were successfully normalized and calibrated using simple procedures and knowledge that the radiometric response Is linear, Noise levels were low, and S/N was about 120 for lab test images and 90 for airborne images of the marsh complex, Vignetting effects were evident in lab images, which were inverted and low-pass filtered to generate a correction mask.

This project illustrates the theoretical basis and the analytical development of the high mast lighting poles. In the late 1960 "s, studies were conducted to investigate the impact that high-mast lighting gives on traffic performance, driver visibility, and illumination costs. It was found that increasing {{the height of the}} lighting offered a noticeable advantage in that it provided drivers with increased <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> illumination and <b>brightness</b> while minimizing discomfort and disability glare. In this turn, it`s led to a reduced number of visibility related accidents. Also, lighting is a major requirement when we deal with working at the opencast mining. In opencast mining, the efficient lighting system is required while working during dark hours. In the present work, a new system of light mast tower is proposed & designed which increases the usability of the existing light mast towers. In this solution, each light mast is given a particular position to its vertical & horizontal axis which sets the light to focus in any particular area and direction to cover target area with minimum power and resource...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{study is}} to develop a {{micromachining}} technology for a light guide panel(LGP) mold, whereby micro dot patterns are formed on a LGP surface by a single injection process instead of existing screen printing processes. The micro powder blasting technique is applied to form micro dot patterns on the LGP mold surface. The optimal conditions for masking, laminating, exposure, and developing processes to form the micro dot patterns are first experimentally investigated. A LGP mold with masked micro patterns is then machined using the micro powder blasting method and the machinability of the micro dot patterns is verified. A prototype LGP is test- injected using the developed LGP mold and a shape analysis of the patterns and performance testing of the injected LGP are carried out. As an additional approach, matte finishing, a special surface treatment method, is applied to the mold surface to improve the light diffusion characteristics, <b>uniformity</b> and <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> the LGP. The results of this study show that the applied powder blasting method can be successfully used to manufacture LGPs with micro patterns by just single injection using the developed mold and thereby replace existing screen printing methods...|$|R

40|$|The {{important}} {{question of the}} segregation of nebulae <b>of</b> different <b>brightness</b> can also only partly be solved until larger Schmidt telescopes are available. In addition, the velocity distribution as a function <b>of</b> the <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> the nebulae must be investigated. The problems of the segregation of nebulae and of the dispersion in the velocities demand also further theoretical clarification since the classical statistical mechanics gives no answer to the fundamental questions which arise in connection with gravitational cooperative assemblies which are composed of such diverse elements as the nebulae, {{the stars and the}} constituents of intergalactic and interstellar matter. The <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> the structure of symmetrical clusters of nebulae observed so far and the quantitative agreement of their observed physical characteristics with those derived theoretically for the isothermal gravitational "gas" sphere suggest that the short-time scale associated customarily with the hypothesis of an expanding universe will perhaps become the less attractive the more the investigations on the large-scale distribution of matter in the universe progress...|$|R

40|$|The <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> wheat seed {{emergence}} is {{an important}} characteristic used to evaluate cultivars, cultivation mode and field management. Currently, researchers typically investigated the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> seed emergence by manual measurement, a time-consuming and laborious process. This study employed field RGB images from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to obtain information related to the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> wheat seed emergence and missing seedlings. The calculation {{of the length of}} areas with missing seedlings in both drill and broadcast sowing can be achieved by using an area localization algorithm, which facilitated the comprehensive evaluation <b>of</b> <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> seed emergence. Through a comparison between UAV images and the results of manual surveys used to gather data on the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> seed emergence, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 0. 44 for broadcast sowing and 0. 64 for drill sowing. The RMSEs of the numbers of missing seedling regions for broadcast and drill sowing were 1. 39 and 3. 99, respectively. The RMSEs of the lengths of the missing seedling regions were 12. 39 cm for drill sowing and 0. 20 cm 2 for broadcast sowing. The UAV image-based method provided a new and greatly improved method for efficiently measuring the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> wheat seed emergence.
