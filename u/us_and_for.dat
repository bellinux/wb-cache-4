5|$|The mineral {{crocoite}} (lead chromate PbCrO4) {{was used}} as a yellow pigment shortly after its discovery. After a synthesis method became available starting from the more abundant chromite, chrome yellow was, together with cadmium yellow, one of the most used yellow pigments. The pigment does not photodegrade, but it tends to darken due to the formation of chromium(III) oxide. It has a strong color, and was used for school buses in the <b>US</b> <b>and</b> <b>for</b> Postal Service (for example Deutsche Post) in Europe. The use of chrome yellow declined due to environmental and safety concerns and was replaced by organic pigments or alternatives free from lead and chromium. Other pigments based on chromium are, for example, the bright red pigment chrome red, which is a basic lead chromate (PbCrO4·Pb(OH)2). A very important chromate pigment, which was used widely in metal primer formulations, was zinc chromate, now replaced by zinc phosphate. A wash primer was formulated to replace the dangerous practice of pretreating aluminium aircraft bodies with a phosphoric acid solution. This used zinc tetroxychromate dispersed in a solution of polyvinyl butyral. An 8% solution of phosphoric acid in solvent was added just before application. It was found that an easily oxidized alcohol was an essential ingredient. A thin layer of about 10–15µm was applied, which turned from yellow to dark green when it was cured. There is still a question as to the correct mechanism. Chrome green is a mixture of Prussian blue and chrome yellow, while the chrome oxide green is chromium(III) oxide.|$|E

However, this and Saudi Arabia's role in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, particularly the stationing of U.S. troops on Saudi soil from 1991, prompted the development of a hostile Islamist response internally.

500|$|Governor Magoffin {{called a}} special session of the Kentucky General Assembly on December 27, 1860, to ask the legislators for a {{convention}} to decide the Commonwealth's course in the sectional conflict.

[...] The Unionists, on the other hand, were unwilling to surrender the fate of the state to a convention that might [...] "in a moment of excitement, adopt the extreme remedy of secession." [...] The Unionist position carried after many of the states rights' legislators, opposing the idea of immediate secession, voted against the convention. The assembly did, however, send six delegates to a February 4 Peace Conference in Washington, D.C., and asked Congress to call a national convention to consider potential resolutions to the secession crisis, including the Crittenden Compromise, proposed by Kentuckian John J. Crittenden.|$|E

[...] The younger Weinberg began playing during segments of the tour's shows, and got a very positive response from audiences and reviewers as a spark plug for the band.

500|$|The Guatemalan coup d'état was reviled internationally. Le Monde of Paris and The Times of London {{attacked}} the United States' coup as a [...] "modern form of economic colonialism". In Latin America, public and official opinion was sharply {{critical of the}} <b>U.S.,</b> <b>and</b> <b>for</b> many Guatemala {{became a symbol of}} armed resistance to U.S. hegemony. Former British Prime Minister Clement Attlee called it [...] "a plain act of aggression". When Allen Dulles described the coup as a victory of [...] "democracy" [...] over communism and claimed that the situation in Guatemala was [...] "being cured by the Guatemalans themselves", a British official remarked that [...] "in places, it might almost be Molotov speaking about... Czechoslovakia or Hitler speaking about Austria". UN Secretary General Hammarskjöld said that the paramilitary invasion with which the U.S. deposed Guatemala's elected government was a geopolitical action that violated the human rights stipulations of the United Nations Charter. Even the usually pro–U.S. newspapers of West Germany condemned the coup. Kate Doyle, the Director of the Mexico Project of the National Security Archives, described the coup as the definitive deathblow to democracy in Guatemala.|$|E

He did not meet with U.S. President Barack Obama on the latter's visit to Cuba in March 2016, although sent him a letter stating that Cuba [...] "has no need of gifts from the empire". That April, he gave his most extensive public appearance in many years when addressing the Communist Party.

In September 2016, Castro was visited at his Havana home by the Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, and later that month was visited by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe.
