However 2 K paint is not {{available}} that is mixed {{a certain amount of}} base with hardner, so 2 K paint has to be used all at a time or discarded the rest. This study covered that colored <b>Urethane</b> paint and colorless <b>urethane</b> paint in top coating process of AR. Top coat <b>urethane</b> paint is divided into colored <b>urethane</b> paint and transparent <b>urethane</b> paint like clear coat. Colored <b>urethane</b> paint is used for paint that contains resin, pigment, solvent and additives. It is color such as black and white. While transparent <b>urethane</b> paint is used for paint that contains resin, solvent and additives. <b>Urethane</b> paint has a paint system that cur after several hours of mixing base and hardner. By a paint technician of a field and empirical data, we can also recognize that according to worker's paint style and experience, although he or she paint same car model and area, paint use of one's is different. There aren't guidelines workers refer to about paint use by car models and work scope because ARP works various car models that are in different color, size and area. After using <b>urethane</b> paint, the rest of paint has come, and there are highs and lows in paint use each time he or she works. Therefore, this study suggest a basic guideline to use paint efficiently and regularly by understanding area, the type of work, and paint use that are appropriate for each car model and regardless of workers and work scopes in AR...|$|R

40|$|Anesthetics {{are often}} used to {{characterize}} the activity of single neurons in-vivo for its advantages such as reduced noise level and convenience in noxious stimulations. Of the anesthetics, <b>urethane</b> had been widely used in some thalamic studies {{under the assumption that}} sensory signals are still relayed to the thalamus under <b>urethane</b> anesthesia and that thalamic response would therefore reflect the response of the awake state. We tested whether this assumption stands by comparing thalamic activity in terms of tonic and burst firing modes during ‘the awake state’ or under ‘urethane anesthesia’ utilizing the extracellular single unit recording technique. First we have tested how thalamic relay neurons respond to the introduction of <b>urethane</b> and then tested how <b>urethane</b> influences thalamic discharges under formalin-induced nociception. <b>Urethane</b> significantly depressed overall firing rates of thalamic relay neurons, which was sustained despite the delayed increase of burst activity over the 4 hour recording period. Thalamic response to nociception under anesthesia was also similar overall except for the slight and transient increase of burst activity. Overall, results demonstrated that <b>urethane</b> suppresses the activity of thalamic relay neurons and that, despite the slight fluctuation of burst firing, formalin-induced nociception cannot significantly change the firing pattern of thalamic relay neurons that was caused by <b>urethane...</b>|$|R

50|$|Creating a cast {{urethane}} {{master pattern}} {{is different from}} the steps involved in creating hard tooling for injection molding. Hard tools for injection molding are going to be subjected to a lot of stress and heat during the injection process. They will see runs of thousands of parts per day. The care that goes into a hard tool involves intense machine programming which costs thousands of dollars alone. The price for hard tooling is balanced by the mass production the tooling brings, which is where cast <b>urethanes</b> begin to differ. Cast <b>urethanes</b> are suited for smaller runs of parts and prototyping. Because the cost for soft tooling is lower, down in the hundreds rather than hundreds of thousands, cast <b>urethanes</b> are excellent resources for creators still testing product design, for one-off products, or for testing market and consumer response to a new product.|$|E
