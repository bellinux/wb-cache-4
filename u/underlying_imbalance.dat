50|$|A {{structural}} (permanent) deficit {{differs from}} a cyclical deficit {{in that it}} exists regardless of {{the point in the}} business cycle due to an <b>underlying</b> <b>imbalance</b> in government revenues and expenditures. Thus, even at the high point of the business cycle when revenues are high the country's economy may still be in deficit. The structural component of the budget is used by some economists as an indication of a government's financial management, as it indicates the underlying balance between long-term government revenues and expenditure, while removing factors that are mainly attributable to the business cycle. Other economists see the structural deficit as simply a reflection of the implied discretionary fiscal stance of the government, that is, a structural deficit would be an expansionary fiscal stance that promotes at least nominal economic growth.|$|E
40|$|Intragenic {{recombination}} rapidly creates protein sequence diversity {{compared with}} random mutation, but {{little is known}} about the relative effects of recombination and mutation on protein function. Here, we compare recombination of the distantly related beta-lactamases PSE- 4 and TEM- 1 to mutation of PSE- 4. We show that, among beta-lactamase variants containing the same number of amino acid substitutions, variants created by recombination retain function with a significantly higher probability than those generated by random mutagenesis. We present a simple model that accurately captures the differing effects of mutation and recombination in real and simulated proteins with only four parameters: (i) the amino acid sequence distance between parents, (h) the number of substitutions, (iii) the average probability that random substitutions will preserve function, and (iv) the average probability that substitutions generated by recombination will preserve function. Our results expose a fundamental functional enrichment in regions of protein sequence space accessible by recombination and provide a framework for evaluating whether the relative rates of mutation and recombination observed in nature reflect the <b>underlying</b> <b>imbalance</b> in their effects on protein function...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The recent {{financial}} crisis has highlighted {{the importance of}} the early detection and correction of macroeconomic vulnerabilities. This has led the European Commission to develop the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP). Under the MIP, the potential vulnerabilities of EU countries are assessed using standard indicators relating to internal and external macroeconomic imbalances. These indicators, however, assume cross-country data are comparable, despite economic and financial structures being very heterogeneous. This is not the case. This paper finds that for countries with substantial international investment, such as Ireland, five of the eleven indicators are materially distorted by financial and non-financial multinational activities. This paper disaggregates these five affected indicators into multinational and indigenous Irish components, insofar as the existing data allows. It finds that for Ireland the MIP indicators underestimate some external imbalances, significantly overestimate private sector credit imbalances and underestimate the deleveraging of the financial sector. Adjusting the indicators to allow for country-specific factors can help diagnose the <b>underlying</b> <b>imbalance,</b> while reducing instances of the MIP highlighting false positives...|$|E

Using disaggregated data from smart meters could be {{a viable alternative to}} what is often perceived as intrusive recognition technology. Disaggregation methods have proven to perform exceptionally well when trained with large quantities of data, but gathering and labelling this data is, in itself, an intrusive process that requires significant effort and could compromise the practicality of such promising systems. Here we show that by synthesising labelled training data, using a domain specific algorithm, an innovative water meter disaggregation system that uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) classifiers can be trained in minutes rather than hours. We show that by artificially synthesising labelled data accuracies of 83 %, 79 % and 85 % with the SVM, ANN and KNN classifiers, respectively can be achieved.

40|$|Crohn's disease (CD) and {{ulcerative}} colitis (UC) {{are the two}} major phenotypes of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) which constitute a spectrum of chronic, debilitating diseases characterised by a relapsing inflammation of the intestinal mucosal lining. Evidence {{from a variety of}} disciplines implicates the intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of idiopathic IBD and their complications, including pouchitis. Many studies have reported a dysbiosis in IBD, characterised by a decrease in diversity, a decreased abundance of some dominant commensal members (such as Clostridium IV and XIVa) and an increase in detrimental bacteria (such as sulphate reducing bacteria and Escherichia coli). Therapies such as prebiotics and probiotics aim to selectively manipulate the intestinal microbiota and have been evaluated as an attractive therapeutic option with few side effects. The multispecies product VSL# 3 was found effective in preventing and maintaining remission in pouchitis, whereas both VSL# 3 and E. coli Nissle were effective in maintaining remission in UC. A more drastic approach to restore the composition of the microbiota and correct the <b>underlying</b> <b>imbalance</b> is a faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT).

It is plausible that Australia could maintain large inflows of foreign capital for some time, given resource demands from China and India.

40|$|International {{adjustment}} and rebalancing of global demand: {{where do we}} stand? Despite {{the appearance of a}} moderate adjustment, the partial narrowing of global imbalances since the global financial crisis masks considerable changes {{in the way in which}} these imbalances are financed and in <b>underlying</b> <b>imbalances</b> in domestic demand. Capital flows from and to the private sector, which in large part financed current account imbalances before the crisis, have plummeted. This reversal is similar in scope to that experienced by emerging economies during the crises of the past decade. However, the collapse in private flows did not lead to a sharp adjustment in current accounts, as private flows were replaced by flows from and to the public sector. The partial decrease in current account imbalances was accompanied by a significant drop in the domestic demand of countries with a current account deficit. So far, the adjustment has been asymmetric, with a smaller increase in demand in surplus economies, which has contributed to subdued global growth. The increase in domestic demand in the surplus economies is itself mostly due to the growth differential between these economies (notably China) and deficit economies, and little to the internal rebalancing of their growth models...|$|R

Results To test the hypothesis that pathological increases or decreases in these synaptic properties could <b>underlie</b> <b>imbalances</b> {{at the level of}} basic neural network function, we explored each type of malfunction in a simulation of autoassociative memory. These network simulations revealed that one impact of impairments or excesses in each of these synaptic properties is to shift the trade-off between pattern separation and pattern completion performance during memory storage and recall. Each type of synaptic pathology either pushed the network balance towards intolerable error in pattern separation or intolerable error in pattern completion. Imbalances caused by pathological impairments or excesses in LTP, LTD, inhibition, or connectivity, could all be exacerbated, or rescued, by the simultaneous modulation of any of the other three synaptic properties. Conclusions Because appropriate modulation of any of the synaptic properties could help re-balance network function, regardless of the origins of the imbalance, we propose a new strategy of personalized cognitive therapeutics guided by assay of pattern completion vs. pattern separation function. Simulated examples and testable predictions of this theorized approach to cognitive therapeutics are presented. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{current debate}} on the European crisis has {{highlighted}} the role of fiscal imbalances in explaining the turmoil that has dominated Europe {{in the past few}} years. This paper adopts {{a different point of view}} by suggesting that intra-European payments imbalances are crucial for the survival of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Indeed, payment imbalances between the North and South have contributed to the accumulation of large stock of foreign debt, while flows of foreign capital ceased to finance productive investments that might have contributed to debt repayments—being used instead to finance consumption and real estate. The dynamic interplay between current account imbalances and the accumulation of foreign debt reveals that, once the system is driven into disequilibrium by a real exchange rate misalignment, the longer a payments imbalance persists and the harder the eventual adjustment will be. Capital reversals, by shifting portfolio balances, then lead the system toward instability, sovereign default, and the collapse of the exchange rate regime. Replacing private with public creditors can temporarily help us to stay away from the point where the system breaks down. But this is only a temporary expedient because the <b>underlying</b> <b>imbalances</b> will need continuing and increasing financing until equilibrium is restored by other means. One permanent solution is the European Central Bank’s (ECB) official monetary transactions program, if the potential expansions to the central bank’s balance sheet can be tolerated...|$|R

A high correlation in expression for a particular serpin–protease pair in healthy tissues was often predictive of a biological interaction. The most striking finding was the dramatic change observed in the regulation of expression between proteases and their cognate inhibitors in diseased tissues.

In the hypovolaemic patient with normal pulmonary function, the use of colloids to maintain colloid osmotic pressure can limit the development of peripheral as well as pulmonary oedema.

The paper structures an empirical investigation of profitability and accumulation around these three factors. The Great Recession was preceded by an unbalanced recovery in which residential investment led demand while business fixed investment was structurally weak, given the strong ex post profitability of capital and the low interest rate environment. It is hypothesized that increased import penetration and concerns about the sustainability of profitability eroded both expectations and confidence about prospective yields.

Although Pisa syndrome develops most commonly in those undergoing long-term treatment with antipsychotics, it has been reported less frequently in patients receiving other medications, such as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. However, it has also been seen in those with other diseases causing neurodegeneration and in those who are not receiving any medication (idiopathic Pisa syndrome).
