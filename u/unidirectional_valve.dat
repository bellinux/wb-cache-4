50|$|The first valve {{to treat}} Hydrocephalus was {{introduced}} in 1949 by Spitz, but this valve had several disadvantages which sometimes risked the patient's life. Knowing this and working in his home shop in Bogotá, Hakim improved and developed an <b>unidirectional</b> <b>valve</b> with the capacity to regulate the CSF pressure by adding a spring pressure control in a stainless steel cone and synthetic sapphire ball. This valve was much safer, and it {{was introduced to the}} medical community in 1966. Despite of all medical advances, all modern valves are built based on his invention. He holds more than 28 United States patents for his various inventions. Nowadays, following his father steps, Carlos, Hakim's eldest son, has continued his father's research in neurosurgery and engineering. Carlos, with the collaboration of his father, has recently developed a programmable and adjustable (through the skin) valve which may prevent ventricular collapse when the pressure of the CSF is too low.|$|E
50|$|Indirect {{calorimetry}} measures O2 {{consumption and}} CO2 production. On {{the assumption that}} all the oxygen is used to oxidize degradable fuels and all the CO, thereby evolved is recovered, {{it is possible to}} calculate the total amount of energy produced. It should be clear that “energy production” means conversion of the chemical free-energy of nutrients into the chemical energy of ATP plus loss of some energy during the oxidation process.Respiratory indirect calorimetry, or only indirect calorimetry (IC) as it is often known by most authors, is a noninvasive and highly accurate method of metabolic rate which has an error rate lower than 1%. It has high reproducibility and has been considered a gold standard method. This method allows estimating BEE and REE, and also allows for identification of energy substrates that are being predominantly metabolized by the body at a specific moment. It is based on the indirect measure of the heat produced by oxidation of macronutrients, which is estimated by monitoring oxygen consumption (O2) and carbon dioxide production (CO2) for a certain period of time. The calorimeter has a gas collector that adapts to the subject and a system that measures the volume and concentrations of O2 and CO2 minute by minute. Through a <b>unidirectional</b> <b>valve,</b> the calorimeter collects and quantifies the volume and concentration of O2 inspired and CO2 expired by the subject. After a volume is met, Resting Energy Expenditure is calculated by the Weir formula and results are displayed in software attached to the system.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveOur {{aim was to}} {{test whether}} a <b>unidirectional</b> <b>valve</b> patch would provide benefit to early and {{long-term}} survival for patients with ventricular septal defect and severe pulmonary artery hypertension. MethodsEight hundred seventy-six cases of ventricular septal defect with severe pulmonary artery hypertension were closed {{with or without a}} <b>unidirectional</b> <b>valve</b> patch and were classified as the <b>unidirectional</b> <b>valve</b> patch (UVP) group (n = 195) and nonvalve patch (NVP) group (n = 681), respectively. Propensity scores of inclusion into the UVP group were used to match 138 pairs between the 2 groups. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were constructed to compare early and long-term survival. ResultsFor the 138 propensity-matched pairs, there were 7 and 9 early deaths (in-hospital deaths) in the UVP and NVP groups, respectively. The difference in early mortality between the 2 groups did not reach statistical significance (χ 2 = 0. 265, P =. 6064). With a mean of 9. 2 ± 4. 92 years' and 2511 patient-years' follow-up, there were 6 late deaths in the UVP group and 7 late deaths in the NVP group. The difference in actuarial survival at 5, 10, 15, and 18 years between the 2 groups was not significant (log-rank test, χ 2 = 0. 565, P =. 331). The difference in the late mortality between the groups with or without a patent patch at the time of discharge did not reach statistical significance (χ 2 = 1. 140, P =. 2856).

40|$|Abstract This study {{investigates the}} fluid flow through tissues where lymphatic {{drainage}} occurs. Lymphatic drainage requires {{the use of}} two valve systems, primary and secondary. Primary valves are located in the initial lymphatics. Overlapping en-dothelial cells around the circumferential lining of lymphatic capillaries are presumed to act as a <b>unidirectional</b> <b>valve</b> system. Secondary valves are located in the lumen of the collecting lymphatics and act as another <b>unidirectional</b> <b>valve</b> system; these are well studied in contrast to primary valves. We propose a model for the drainage of fluid by the lymphatic system that includes the primary valve system. The analysis in this work incorporates the mechanics of the primary lymphatic valves as well as the fluid flow through the interstitium and that through the walls of the blood capillar-ies. The model predicts a piecewise linear relation between the drainage flux and the pressure difference between the blood and lymphatic capillaries. The model describes a permeable membrane around a blood capillary, an elastic primary lymphatic valve and the interstitium lying between the two...|$|E
40|$|A {{breathing}} system {{is defined as}} an assembly of components, which delivers gases from the anesthesia machine to the patients′ airways. When the components are arranged as a circle, it is termed a circle system. The flow of exhaled gases is unidirectional in the system. The system contains a component (absorber), which absorbs exhaled carbon dioxide {{and it is not}} necessary to give high fresh gas flows as in Mapleson systems. When the adjustable pressure limiting (APL) valve is closed and all the exhaled gases without carbon dioxide are returned to the patient, the system becomes a totally closed one. Such a circle system can be used with flows as low as 250 to 500 mL and clinically can be termed as low-flow systems. The components of the circle system can be arranged in different ways with adherence to basic rules: (1) <b>Unidirectional</b> <b>valve</b> must be present between the reservoir bag and the patient on both inspiratory and expiratory sides; (2) fresh gas must not enter the system between the expiratory <b>unidirectional</b> <b>valve</b> and the patient; and (3) the APL valve must not be placed between the patient and the inspiratory <b>unidirectional</b> <b>valve.</b> The functional analysis is explained in detail. During the function, the arrangement of components is significant only at higher fresh gas flows. With the introduction of low resistance valves, improved soda lime canisters and low dead space connectors, the use of less complicated pediatric circle systems is gaining popularity to anesthetize children. There are bidirectional flow systems with carbon dioxide absorption. The Waters to and fro system, a classic example of bidirectional flow systems with a canister to absorb carbon dioxide, is valveless and portable.

Methods Seventy-four patients were recruited in the study and prospectively evaluated in a multidisciplinary university ICU towards the appearance of ICU-AW. APACHE II admission score was 16 ± 6 and ICU stay 26 ± 18 days. ICU-AW was diagnosed with the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale for the clinical evaluation of muscle strength. MIP was measured using the <b>unidirectional</b> <b>valve</b> method, independently of the patients' ability to cooperate. Results A significant correlation was found between MIP and MRC (r = 0. 68, p 2 O for MIP was defined by ROC curve analysis for ICU-AW diagnosis (88 % sensitivity, 76 % specificity). Patients with MIP below the cut-off point of 36 cmH 2 O had a significant greater weaning period (10 ± 14 versus 3 ± 3 days, p = 0. 004) also shown by Kaplan-Meier analysis (log-rank: 8. 2;p = 0. 004).

40|$|Inflammation has a {{profound}} effect on the vascular circulation, but little is known about its effect on the lymphatics. In {{the first half of this}} dissertation, I examine the effect of inflammation directly on the barrier properties of the initial lymphatics in the rat spinotrapezius muscle. I hypothesize that fluid that travels from the interstitium into the initial lymphatics must travel through the primary valves, a <b>unidirectional</b> <b>valve</b> system that allows fluid to flow into the lymphatics, but not back out. I determine that a particle with diameter 0. 5 [mu]m is able to pass through the primary valves, but particles with diameter 0. 8 [mu]m and larger are unable to. Acute inflammation does not change this property, although it does allow fluid to escape back into the interstitium at a rate greater than that in healthy animals. This suggests that during inflammation the initial lymphatics are compromised and the primary valves do not function as a <b>unidirectional</b> <b>valve</b> system. In addition, I hypothesize that the lymphatic system is responsible for removing toxic peptides and lipids from the interstitium to limit their damage to the tissue. By doing this, the lymphatic endothelium, lymphocytes and dendritic cells collected by the lymphatics, and cells in the lymph node are being exposed to these toxic mediators. I provide evidence that lymph collected from the rat mesenteric lymph duct is toxic both under healthy conditions as well as under inflammatory condition...|$|E

30|$|Mechanical {{ventilation}} generally {{results in}} a loss of respiratory muscle strength [1, 2]. The prevalence of respiratory muscle weakness is high, and the causes are multifactorial [3 – 5]. Assessment of respiratory muscle strength is becoming common practice in intensive care.

Respiratory muscle strength has been established as prognostic of successful weaning and mortality [6 – 8]. Measurement of maximum respiratory pressures is a simple, non-invasive method to quantify the global strength of the inspiratory and expiratory muscles. Pressures can be measured using a manometer with a <b>unidirectional</b> <b>valve</b> or the “Negative Inspiratory Force” (NIF) function available on most ventilators.

30|$|Measurement of maximal {{respiratory}} pressures requires patient cooperation, {{which can}} be difficult when patients are intubated; however, similar pressures were recorded during intubation and extubation, with slightly higher pressures during intubation.

There is a growing body of evidence that certain well-defined sub-groups of patients with advanced emphysema may benefit from ELVR, provided the selection criteria are met and a systematic approach is followed. ELVR devices, particularly <b>unidirectional</b> <b>valves</b> and coils, are currently being rolled out to many countries outside of the USA and Europe, although very few centres currently have the capacity to correctly evaluate and provide ELVR to prospective candidates. The high cost of these interventions underpins the need for careful patient selection to best identify those who may or may not benefit from ELVR-related procedures. The aim of this review is to provide the practicing pulmonologist with an overview of the practical aspects and current evidence for the use of the various techniques available, and to suggest an evidence-based approach for the appropriate use of these devices, particularly in emerging markets, where there should be a drive to develop and equip key specialised ELVR units.
