According to drummer Brian Lane, [...] "Jesse [...] wrote {{a lot of the}} lyrics about different things than 'I just broke <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> girlfriend' for the new record," [...] as Lacey had written the songs on an acoustic guitar in his bedroom. Lane also explained that the band was now influenced by a range of different artists, [...] "All of us got exposed to a lot of different music that all of us were listening to. For the first [...] we weren't in such close quarters for 24 hours a day. I think that {{has a lot to do}} with it."

500|$|... "Nice Is Different Than Good" [...] {{revealed}} {{the identity of}} Mike Delfino's bride, a mystery which served as the cliffhanger for the fifth season finale. Cherry revealed that he initially intended to have Mike marry Katherine Mayfair rather than Susan Mayer, but fans [...] "were insistent" [...] on having Mike marry Susan. As a result, Cherry decided to change the storyline [...] "as opposed to frustrating the fans for another year by keeping Mike and Susan apart." [...] The episode also introduced the long-running storyline of Katherine suffering a nervous breakdown after losing Mike to Susan. Cherry commented {{that it would be}} [...] "one of the funniest breakdowns you've ever seen." [...] Actress Dana Delany, who portrays Katherine, was not informed about the storyline change until a week before the episode began filming. She called the change [...] "brilliant" [...] and was pleased with her character's new storyline [...] "because happiness is great in life, but it's kind of [...] boring dramatically." [...] To keep the identity of Mike's bride confidential, a stunt actress was used in the season five finale. When filming of the episode took place in July 2009, both Hatcher and Delany were photographed wearing wedding dresses on set. [...] "Nice Is Different Than Good" [...] also introduced the secondary ongoing mystery of the Fairview strangler. The episode ended with a cliffhanger in which Julie Mayer is strangled by an unknown attacker. Cherry said of the storyline, [...] "I've come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> own version of 'Who Shot J.R.?'," [...] referencing the murder mystery plotline surrounding the J. R. Ewing character (Larry Hagman) in the popular primetime soap opera Dallas.|$|E

2500|$|One {{can easily}} guess what a European {{historical}} and existentialist philosopher might reply [...] You ask me, he would say, to 'die to History'; but man is not, and he cannot be anything else but History, for his very essence is temporality. You are asking me, then, {{to give up}} my authentic existence and to take refuge in an abstraction, in pure Being, in the atman: I am to sacrifice my dignity as a creator of History in order to live an a-historic, inauthentic existence, empty of all human content. Well, I prefer to put <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> anxiety: at least, it cannot deprive me of a certain heroic grandeur, that of becoming conscious of, and accepting, the human condition.|$|E

2500|$|It was a {{financial}} relief of some magnitude when, in 1889, Henry was made Bishop of Tasmania, then still a British colony and Bernard spent his formative years there. Bishop Montgomery considered it {{his duty to}} spend as much time as possible in the rural areas of Tasmania and was away for up to six months at a time. While he was away, his wife, still in her mid-twenties, gave her children [...] "constant" [...] beatings, then ignored them most of the time as she performed the public duties of the bishop's wife. Of Bernard's siblings, Sibyl died prematurely in Tasmania, and Harold, Donald and Una all emigrated. Maud Montgomery took little active interest in the education of her young children other than to have them taught by tutors brought from Britain. The loveless environment made Bernard something of a bully, as he himself recalled, [...] "I was a dreadful little boy. I don't suppose anybody would put <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> sort of behaviour these days." [...] Later in life Montgomery refused to allow his son David {{to have anything to do}} with his grandmother, and refused to attend her funeral in 1949.|$|E
2500|$|At first glance, Schiller appears {{very similar}} to James. However, Schiller’s more {{stringent}} requirement that meaningful statements have consequences [...] "to some one for some purpose" [...] makes Schiller’s position more extreme than James’. For Schiller, {{it is not a}} sufficient condition for meaningfulness that a statement entail experiential consequences (as it is for both Peirce and James). Schiller requires that the consequences of a statement make the statement relevant to some particular person’s goals at a specific moment in time {{if it is to be}} meaningful. Therefore, it is not simply enough that the statement [...] "diamonds are hard" [...] and the statement [...] "diamonds are soft" [...] entail different experiential consequences, it is also required that the experiential difference makes a difference to someone’s purposes. Only then, and only to that person, do the two statements state something different. If the experiential difference between hard and soft diamonds did not connect <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> purpose for entering into thought, the two statements would possess the same meaning. For example, if I were to randomly blurt out [...] "diamonds are hard" [...] and then [...] "diamonds are soft" [...] to everyone in a coffee shop one day, my words would mean nothing. Words can only mean something if they are stated with a specific purpose.|$|E
