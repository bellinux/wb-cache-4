5|$|The book {{attracted}} academic interest, {{and scholars}} discussed it {{in at least}} three distinct categories: language and style, often in relation to the politics of totalitarianism; trauma studies, given the psychological pressure on the novel's characters, who grow <b>up</b> <b>under</b> <b>a</b> totalitarian regime; and ethnographic and literary studies of the German minority in Romania. On the latter topic, Valentina Glajar, now at Texas State University, published an article in 1997. Müller's Herztier is one of the four titles discussed in Glajar's 2004 monograph The German Legacy, on German-language literature from Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{seasonal}} frosting {{of areas}} near the southern ice cap {{results in the}} formation of transparent 1-metre-thick slabs of dry ice above the ground. With the arrival of spring, sunlight warms the subsurface and pressure from subliming CO2 builds <b>up</b> <b>under</b> <b>a</b> slab, elevating and ultimately rupturing it. This leads to geyser-like eruptions of CO2 gas mixed with dark basaltic sand or dust. This process is rapid, observed happening {{in the space of a}} few days, weeks or months, a rate of change rather unusual in geology – especially for Mars. The gas rushing underneath a slab to the site of a geyser carves a spiderweb-like pattern of radial channels under the ice, the process being the inverted equivalent of an erosion network formed by water draining through a single plughole.|$|E

25|$|The river's natural {{surroundings}} remain relatively wild, and are {{the subject}} of an environmental scheme by the name of a SDAGE (Schéma Directeur d’Aménagement et de Gestion des Eaux), set <b>up</b> <b>under</b> <b>a</b> French law. Its aim is to conserve and make the best use of the whole hydrological system by viewing it as a unit. That involves reconciling the hydro-electric stations with the boating, fishing, swimming and perhaps water extraction in view of the tendency to industrial development on the reclaimed delta land at its confluence with the Rhone at its southern end.|$|E
25|$|In the {{immediate}} post-war era, despite {{an influx of}} excellent new players, Richmond struggled to make the four, appearing in the finals only once, in 1947. Dyer continued on as coach for three years after his playing retirement {{at the end of}} 1949, but was asked to retire by the committee who felt the club needed a shake <b>up.</b> <b>Under</b> <b>a</b> succession of coaches in the 1950s, With the demands of potential players increasing with each passing year, the club refused to allocate sufficient funds to recruit and they failed to replace star players as they retired. When stalwarts such as Des Rowe and dual-Brownlow Medallist Roy Wright left, the team slumped dramatically and finished with a wooden spoon in 1960.|$|E

25|$|Before the {{restoration}} work was undertaken, vandalism and illegal encroachments were rampant {{at the site}} of the tomb, presenting a serious danger to the preservation of this invaluable treasure. At the main entrance of Humayun’s Tomb, dingy stalls had been put <b>up</b> <b>under</b> <b>a</b> very corrupt system of municipal patronage known as tehbazari, and all sorts of heavy vehicles were allowed to be parked illegally in these open spaces. On the Nila Gumbad side was a huge citadel of India’s vote bank politics — thousands of ‘slum dwellers’ were kept by an influential section of the political leadership to serve as ‘bonded voters’ during elections. The environment of the dargah of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya had also been ruthlessly degraded and the holy tank had become a messy cesspool.|$|E

2500|$|The beachfront was {{severely}} {{damaged by the}} 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The tsunami waves, caused due to an M 9.2 magnitude earthquake at about 257km south-southeast of Banda Aceh, Sumatra, Indonesia, on the Indian Ocean floor on 26 December 2004 at 6.20am IST, struck the beach, which is about 2028km North West from the epicentre, at 8.40am IST. The reported height of the tsunami waves at the beach was 6m which washed away about 206 persons on the beach, {{most of whom were}} morning joggers and children playing cricket on the beach, including a few tourists. With the assistance of the World Bank, the government built 2,000 temporary Marina beach shelters each measuring about 250sq.ft. to house families affected by the tsunami at a cost of [...] 172.3 million.

[...] In an article published in the Chicago Daily Tribune, Hammond defended himself:"Tom Hammond feels bad about the attack on him.
