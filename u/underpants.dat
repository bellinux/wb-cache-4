50|$|The French knicker style {{evolved from}} drawers, the baggy long-legged {{underwear}} of the Victorian era, {{and may have}} derived {{its name from the}} frilly underwear worn by Parisienne Can-Can dancers, existent from the late-1800s to the early-1900s; the French however, do not use the term. During the 1920s and 1930s, French knickers were very popular, but by the 1940s and 1950s, briefs were worn by most women; perhaps due to fabric shortages and the scarcity of silk. By the 1950s, the fitted <b>underpant</b> was almost universally worn.|$|R

5|$|Several of the {{statements}} originated from the juveniles who had been arrested shortly after the murder. They included Jason Hill, the 13-year-old who had been held for three days in his <b>underpants</b> and a blanket, without access to his parents or a lawyer. (Hill received £30,000 in damages from the police over his treatment.)

Another statement was from Mark Pennant, also a juvenile who had been arrested during the first inquiry. Overall it appeared that Silcott was being retried.|$|E
5|$|Late in Friday's {{first season}} in Wales, Cardiff took on Luton Town on 16 April 1977. Cardiff {{were in the}} relegation zone and had not won in seven games, while Luton were fifth in the table and {{challenging}} for promotion. After clashing repeatedly early in the match with Luton goalkeeper Milija Aleksic, Friday was lectured by the referee for a high tackle on the goalkeeper in the 36th minute. Friday held {{out a hand to}} apologise, but Aleksic reacted angrily. When the free kick was taken, Friday ran back, stole the ball from Luton defender John Faulkner, broke away, rounded Aleksic and slotted the ball past him into the net. In celebration, Friday jogged back past the goalkeeper while giving him the V-sign. Cardiff won the match 4–2 {{and at the end of}} the season avoided relegation to the third tier only on goal difference. Meanwhile, without Friday, Reading were relegated back to the Fourth Division by one point. Friday's actions became even stranger during his time at Cardiff; after they lost the second leg of the Welsh Cup final 3–0 to Shrewsbury Town on 18 May 1977, the players and staff were awoken in the middle of the night by loud bangs coming from below their rooms. The cause was found to be Friday, standing on the hotel's snooker table in his <b>underpants</b> and throwing the balls around the room in fury.|$|E

French knickers are worn from the hip, concealing some of the upper thigh and all of the buttocks. The garment features an [...] "open leg" [...] style (a loose fitting leg opening without elastic cuffs) that allows for a more comfortable fit and the straight-cut leg cuffs can be designed with or without trimming. The fabric is often bias cut.|$|R
50|$|The {{decisions}} of the tribunal {{are available on the}} internet beginning with decisions made in 2007. From time to time, {{decisions of}} the tribunal attract media attention. In 2006, the tribunal deregistered a nurse employed to look after dementia patients at a retirement village. The tribunal found that the nurse had engaged in professional misconduct as her nursing care was unskilled. The tribunal found that the nurse had fallen asleep whilst caring for her patients, mocked or demeaned patients, and had used excessive force in dealing with patients.In another case the tribunal ordered the suspension of a nurse for professional misconduct.

He knows that Bodger has a badger {{in the flat}} after Badger hits {{him on the head}} with a frying pan. He is {{incredibly}} stupid and is always trying to prove to Mrs Dribelle that there is a badger in the flat by all means possible, but he never succeeds. In one episode he dressed up as Mrs Dribelle's mother to trick Simon into believing Mrs Dribelle had nowhere to live, so that she could get Simon {{to move out of the}} flat. However Badger, who could see Elton's <b>underpants</b> underneath his skirt, knew it was Elton so he tried to show Simon the <b>underpants.</b> First he pulled the lever when Elton was sitting on the bed which made the bed go back, but it still did not work so Badger thought of another way to show Simon the <b>underpants</b> by turning the vacuum cleaner on, which sucked up the skirt Elton was wearing. Simon then saw the <b>underpants</b> and realised it was Elton. Even though Mrs Dribelle features in Series 7, Elton did not feature after Series 6. He was last seen in the episode 'Badger's Party' where he was attacked by children who were St John Badger Scouts.|$|E

A skirt-like garment to cover the crotch and bottom was no more necessary. In an intermediate stage to openly wearing trousers the upper classes favoured voluminous pantskirts and diverted skirts like the padded hose or the latter petticoat breeches.|$|E

25|$|During Prima Vera's hiatus {{in early}} 1984, Falsk toured Norway with a solo {{stand-up}} comedy show. Prima Vera's shows {{had always had}} a certain element of toilet humor in their material, but for his solo act, Falsk got even dirtier. Falsk's solo act was described by some critics as vulgar and obscene, {{but in spite of}} this, or maybe because of it, the show was a big hit with the fans. The show was also recorded and released as an album, called Born in Drammen, which {{is believed to be the}} first ever stand-up comedy album released in Norway. The album title is a reference to Bruce Springsteen's Born in the USA, which topped the charts in Norway at the time, and the album cover is an almost exact copy of the Born in the USA cover, except that Falsk is not wearing jeans or even <b>underpants</b> on the picture. After the Prima Vera breakup, Falsk did another comedy tour in 1985, and released a second comedy album called Falskboy, which also contained a few songs by Tom Mathisen.|$|E

Harrison explained: [...] "The name of the company came about as a bit of a joke.
