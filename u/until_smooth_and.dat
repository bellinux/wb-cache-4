Eggs and liquid flavoring are mixed in, and finally dry and liquid ingredients are added in. The creaming method combines rise gained from air bubbles in the creamed butter with the rise from the chemical leaveners.

The flour is added to hot oil on the stove top, blended <b>until</b> <b>smooth,</b> <b>and</b> cooked to the desired level of brownness. Clarified butter, vegetable oils, bacon drippings or lard are commonly used fats. Roux {{is used as a}} thickening agent for gravy, sauces, soups and stews. It provides the base for a dish, and other ingredients are added after the roux is complete.|$|E

50|$|Two {{principal}} {{techniques are}} used to produce seed beads: the wound method and the drawn method. The wound method is the more-traditional technique, is more time consuming, {{and is no longer}} used in modern bead production: in this technique, a chunk of glass known in glassmaking as a gather and composed mainly of silicon is heated on an iron bar until molten. A second bar of iron is then inserted into the gather and the two bars quickly drawn apart creating a long glass rod (the final width of which would depend on how quickly and how far the bars are separated before the glass solidifies). This rod is then cut into shorter rods for handling. Next, one of these is re-heated and wound around a hot metal wire creating a ring of glass which is then worked and shaped <b>until</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>and</b> round. This is done several times on the same wire creating a series of glass rings. Once the wire cools, the rings are slipped off and then used as beads. For the drawn method, an air bubble is created within the gather and as the iron bars are drawn apart they produce a long tube rather than a rod. This tube is then cooled, cut into rings, and the rings are tumbled to remove sharp edges before being used as beads.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of subgingival application of Carisolv™ gel as an adjunctive therapy to scaling and root planing (SRP) on calculus removal compared to conventional instrumentation. Forty-five teeth requiring extraction due to severe periodontal disease were randomized to the following treatments: 1) SRP alone; 2) placebo gel + SRP; 3) Carisolv™ gel + SRP. Either test or placebo gel was applied subgingivally for 1 min and then the root were instrumented <b>until</b> a <b>smooth</b> <b>and</b> calculus-free surface was achieved. Instrumentation time and the number of strokes required were recorded. After extraction, the efficacy of root surface instrumentation was measured by percentage of remaining calculus. There was no statistically significant difference (p> 0. 05) between the treatment groups regarding either time required for instrumentation or the percentage of residual calculus. The subgingival application of Carisolv™ gel prior to SRP did not provide any additional benefit to root instrumentation compared to scaling and root planing alone...|$|R
30|$|To {{measure the}} average surface {{roughness}} (Ra) of the teeth, a {{surface roughness tester}} (SJ- 400; Mitutouo, Kawasaki-Shi, Japan) was used at a speed of 0.05  mm/s speed, with a length of 1.25  mm and a cut-off of 0.25  mm. Three measurements in different directions, each offset by 120 °, were recorded, and the initial Ra was determined for each tooth prior to bracket bonding. After the failure analysis, the teeth were finished with a multilaminated carbide bur (FF 9642; JET, Morrisburg, ON, Canada), at low rpm (rotations per minute) under intermittent water cooling <b>until</b> a visibly <b>smooth</b> <b>and</b> polished surface was obtained (80  s), after which the final Ra was measured.|$|R
50|$|Restoration of a vehicle’s {{exterior}} {{can take many}} forms. A vehicle that has been left or abandoned will often accumulate rust over time. Sometimes this rust deterioration can render an exterior part unusable. In which case a replacement part like a fender, front grill or door mirror much be purchased outright from an external source. If rust damage is minor however the part will undergo rust repair. This {{is the process of}} removing rust from metal and returning structural integrity. This is accomplished by removing the rust through sanding or blasting to get down to bare metal. Then new sheet metal or fiberglass is applied to the affected area. Finally the piece is worked <b>until</b> <b>smooth,</b> primed <b>and</b> re-painted. Other materials like glass and weather stripping must be replaced as they become damaged over time. Factors like weather erosion can lead to faded and broken glass as well as dried out weather stripping. Another typical area of exterior repair is dent removal. This entails taking the original metal and re-working it to remove dents and other such blemishes. Professionals often use hammer and dolly work to remove dents. This involves placing the dented metal piece over a curved metal dolly and using an electric or manual hammer to remove the dent <b>and</b> <b>smooth</b> the metal.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze, under {{scanning}} electron microscopy (SEM), the morphologic characteristics of root surfaces after application of CarisolvTM gel in association with scaling and root planing (SRP). Sixty periodontally compromised extracted human teeth were randomly assigned to 6 groups: 1) SRP alone; 2) passive topical application of CarisolvTM + SRP; 3) active topical application of CarisolvTM + SRP; 4) multiple applications of CarisolvTM + SRP; 5) SRP + 24 % EDTA; 6) topical application of CarisolvTM + SRP + 24 % EDTA. CarisolvTM gel was applied to root surfaces for 30 s, followed by scaling and root planing, consisting of 50 strokes with Gracey curettes in an apical-coronal direction, parallel to the long axis of the tooth. The only exception was group 4, in which the roots were instrumented <b>until</b> a <b>smooth,</b> hard <b>and</b> glass-like surface was achieved. All specimens were further analyzed by SEM. The results showed that the treatment with CarisolvTM caused significant changes in root surface morphology of periodontally compromised teeth only when the chemical agent was actively applied (burnishing technique). CarisolvTM failed to remove the smear layer completely, especially with a single application, independently of the method of application. Multiple applications of CarisolvTM were necessary to achieve a smear layer reduction comparable to that obtained with 24 % EDTA conditioning...|$|R

But at each step as they descended, Elizabeth observed that they were leaving the day behind them. Even the heartless but bright rays of a December sun were missed as they glided into the cold gloom of the valley. Along the summits of the mountains in the eastern range, it is true, the light still lingered, receding step by step from the earth into the clouds that were gathering with the evening mist, about the limited horizon, but the frozen lake lay without a shadow on its bosom; the dwellings were becoming already gloomy and indistinct, and the wood-cutters were shouldering their axes and preparing to enjoy, throughout the long evening before them, the comforts of those exhilarating fires that their labor had been supplying with fuel. They paused only to gaze at the passing sleighs, to lift their caps to Marmaduke, to exchange familiar nods with Richard, and each disappeared in his dwelling. The paper curtains dropped behind our travellers in every window, shutting from the air even the firelight of the cheerful apartments, and when the horses of her father turned with a rapid whirl into the open gate of the mansion-house, and nothing stood before her but the cold dreary stone walls of the building, as she approached them through an avenue of young and leafless poplars, Elizabeth felt as if all the loveliness of the mountain-view had vanished like the fancies of a dream. Marmaduke retained so much of his early habits as to reject the use of bells, but the equipage of Mr. Jones came dashing through the gate after them, sending its jingling sounds through every cranny of the building, and in a moment the dwelling was in an uproar.|$|R
