Distinctions and characteristics in perceiving land <b>use</b> <b>categories</b> were described by a psychological method that was submitted to Japanese graduate and undergraduate students. In addition the results were analyzed using corresponddence analysis, a statistical technique for categorical data.

To prepare khaya, tubers are first soaked in water for approximately one month. Then they are left outside during hot, sunny days and cold, freezing nights until they become completely dehydrated. This process is similar to the preparation of chuñu from bitter potatoes.

Biolink zones are identified parts of the landscape where the functional ecological connectivity for biodiversity is enhanced and / or restored to provide space for species (and consequently ecological communities) to self adapt their distributions and abundances under changing climates through natural processes including: dispersal; re-colonisation; regeneration and restoration of ecological function (Mansergh and Cheal 2007).|$|E
