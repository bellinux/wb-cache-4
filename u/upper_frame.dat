5000|$|Once {{fully closed}} bodies became the norm, it was {{considered}} fashionable to remove the central roof support post {{to give them a}} more open touring look. The first [...] "hardtops" [...] appeared during the 1915-1918 era as [...] "convertible cars", marketed as [...] "touring sedans" [...] or [...] "Springfields" [...] because many automakers had the bodies built by Springfield Body Company under license from Fisher Body and others. The Springfield design featured folding <b>upper</b> <b>frames</b> on the doors and the rear glass frames are removable and stored under or behind the seats.|$|R
2500|$|With the {{advancement}} of technology and design in 2010 major revolver manufacturers are coming out with polymer frame revolvers like the Ruger LCR, Smith & Wesson Bodyguard 38, and Taurus Protector Polymer. [...] The new innovative design incorporates advanced polymer technology that lowers weight significantly, helps absorbs recoil, and strong enough to handle +P and [...]357 Magnum loads. [...] The polymer is only used on the lower frame and joined to a metal alloy <b>upper</b> <b>frame,</b> barrel, and cylinder. Polymer technology {{is considered one of}} the major advancements in revolver history because the frame has always been metal alloy and mostly one piece frame design.|$|E
6000|$|Fortunately for the {{progress}} of the work, Lee, the Vineyard man, was a ship-carpenter, and his skill essentially surpassed that of Smith, who filled the same station on board the Oyster Pond craft. These two men were now of the greatest service; for, though neither understood drafting, each was skilful in the use of tools, and had a certain readiness that enabled him to do a hundred things that he had never found it necessary to attempt on any former occasion. If the <b>upper</b> <b>frame</b> that was now got on the Sea Lion was not of faultless mould, it was securely fastened, and rendered the craft even stronger than it had been originally. Some regard was had to resisting the pressure of ice, and experience had taught all the sealers where the principal defences against the effects of a [...] "nip" [...] ought to be placed. The lines were not perfect, it is true; but this was of less moment, as the bottom of the craft, which alone had any material influence on her sailing, was just as it had come from the hands of the artizan who had originally moulded her.|$|E

50|$|The {{starting}} point is a given discrete pointdistribution. In the <b>upper</b> left-hand <b>frame</b> of the figure, a point distribution is plotted in which {{at the center of}} the frame an object is located whose density diminishes radially outwards. In thefirst step of the DTFE, the Delaunay tessellation of the pointdistribution is constructed. This is a volume-covering divisionof space into triangles (tetrahedra in three dimensions), whosevertices are formed by the point distribution (see figure, <b>upper</b> right-hand <b>frame).</b> The Delaunay tessellation is defined suchthat inside the interior of the circumcircle of each Delaunay triangle no other points from the defining point distribution are present.|$|R

50|$|The hut-shaped façade has two {{orders of}} loggias: the lower one has three arcades of same span, which join the portico ones, which are {{slightly}} higher. The upper loggia {{was used by}} the bishops to bless the citizens.The portico's arcade are supported by pillars, flanked by semi-columns. They have double archivolts, while the portico's <b>upper</b> <b>frame</b> is decorated with Lombard bands, which are repeated also on the façade. Thin lesenes start from the pillars' centres, reaching the <b>upper</b> <b>frame.</b> The capitals are decorated by animal (lions, wild boars), and human figures (mostly heads, but also angels and others), as well as by vegetable or fantastic motifs of pre-Romanesque origin.|$|E
60|$|Two {{somewhat}} memorable {{circumstances in}} the annals of the Bell Rock attended the operations of this day: one was the removal of Mr. James Dove, the foreman smith, with his apparatus, from the rock to {{the upper part of the}} beacon, where the forge was now erected on a temporary platform, laid on the cross beams or <b>upper</b> <b>framing.</b> The other was the artificers having dined for the first time upon the rock, their dinner being cooked on board of the yacht, and sent to them by one of the boats. But what afforded the greatest happiness and relief was the removal of the large bellows, which had all along been a source of much trouble and perplexity, by their hampering and incommoding the boat which carried the smiths and their apparatus.|$|R
30|$|The {{constants}} A and B {{are called}} lower and <b>upper</b> probabilistic <b>frame</b> bounds, respectively. If A=B, then {{the frame is}} called a probabilistic A-tight frame for H, and if A=B= 1, then it is called a probabilistic Parseval frame. If only the upper inequality holds, then we call μ a Bessel measure.|$|R

40|$|In {{the study}} of Weyl-Heisenberg frames the {{assumption}} of having a finite <b>frame</b> <b>upper</b> bound appears recurrently. In this note it is shown that it actually depends critically on the timefrequency lattice used. Indeed, for any irrational ff ? 0 we can construct a smooth g 2 L 2 (R) such that for any two rationals a ? 0 and b ? 0 the collection (g na;mb) n;m 2 Z of time-frequency translates of g has a finite <b>frame</b> <b>upper</b> bound, while for any fi ? 0 and any rational c ? 0 the collection (g ncff;mfi) n;m 2 Z has no such bound...|$|R
50|$|The 4D Fusion Wheel {{replaces the}} {{standard}} Fusion Wheel. It {{is made of}} multiple parts, including the PC Frame, Metal Frame, and Core. Some omit a standard frame and core design, such as L-Drago Destroy which has an <b>upper</b> metal <b>frame</b> to replace the Energy Ring and a lower PC core with rubber inserts to replace the Fusion Wheel, essentially flipping the common construction of most tops from this system.|$|R
50|$|The Clare currach closely resembled {{that of the}} Aran Islands. In construction, {{a series}} of wooden markers were sunk into the ground at {{definite}} distances apart. These helped show the width desired for the lower gunwale frame. This was constructed first, followed by the <b>upper</b> <b>frame,</b> and the thwarts were then nailed into place.|$|E
50|$|Several revolvers use recoil to cock {{the hammer}} and advance the {{cylinder}}. In these designs, the barrel and cylinder are affixed to an <b>upper</b> <b>frame</b> which recoils atop a sub-frame. As to upper receiver recoils, the cylinder is advanced and hammer cocked, functions {{that are usually}} done manually. Notable examples are the Webley-Fosbery and Mateba.|$|E

When loading onto a ski lift, the chair catches {{the upper part}} of the HangBoard, which then rests on the seat beside the pilot.

40|$|Loosely speaking, a semi-frame is a {{generalized}} frame for {{which one of}} the frame bounds is absent. More precisely, given a total sequence in a Hilbert space, we speak of an upper (resp. lower) semi-frame if only the <b>upper</b> (resp. lower) <b>frame</b> bound is valid. Equivalently, for an <b>upper</b> semi-frame, the <b>frame</b> operator is bounded, but has an unbounded inverse, whereas a lower semi-frame has an unbounded frame operator, with bounded inverse. We study mostly upper semi-frames, both in the continuous case and in the discrete case, and give some remarks for the dual situation. In particular, we show that reconstruction is still possible in certain cases. Comment: 25 page...|$|R

50|$|The {{undercarriage}} of the Styx was fixed, {{with a wide}} track, large {{wheels and}} no cross-axle, making it suitable for roughly prepared landing fields. Each mainwheel was mounted on a V-strut hinged on the lower fuselage frame with a single, shock absorbing oleo landing leg to the <b>upper</b> <b>frame.</b> Undercarriage legs and struts were enclosed in dural fairings. There was a steel-shod, castoring, rubber cord sprung tailskid.|$|E

50|$|It had a {{one-piece}} wing of rectangular plan out to semi-elliptical {{tips and}} built around two spruce spars and plywood ribs. There was no dihedral.

The engine is a stressed member and the swingarm pivots in engine's crankcase. The DB1s triple-trees, clip-ons, rear-sets and several other bits are made of lightweight, hot stamped and billet Avional 14 aluminum. The Cagiva/Bimota/Ducati/DB1 prototype morphed into the Ducati Paso ironically designed by Bimota co-founder Massimo Tamburini.|$|R
