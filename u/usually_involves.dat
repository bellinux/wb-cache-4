5|$|Clarinet choir, which {{features}} {{a large number of}} clarinets playing together, <b>usually</b> <b>involves</b> a range of different members of the clarinet family (see Extended family of clarinets). The homogeneity of tone across the different members of the clarinet family produces an effect with some similarities to a human choir.|$|E
5|$|Ring dunk: A non school sanctioned {{tradition}} performed after {{a student}} receives an Aggie Ring; <b>usually</b> <b>involves</b> chugging {{a pitcher of}} beer, or a non-alcoholic substitute, with their Aggie Ring in the bottom then catching the ring in their teeth.|$|E
5|$|Treatment for {{reactive}} attachment disorder {{for children}} <b>usually</b> <b>involves</b> {{a mix of}} therapy, counseling, and parenting education.

5000|$|Masonic {{conspiracy}} theories are {{conspiracy theories}} involving Freemasonry; hundreds of such conspiracy theories {{have been described}} since the late 18th century. [...] Generally, these theories fall into three distinct categories: political (<b>usually</b> <b>involving</b> allegations of control of government, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom), religious (<b>usually</b> <b>involving</b> allegations of anti-Christian or Satanic beliefs or practices), and cultural (<b>usually</b> <b>involving</b> popular entertainment). Many conspiracy theory writers have connected Freemasons (and the Knights Templar) with worship of the devil; these ideas are based on different interpretations of the doctrines of those organizations.|$|R

5|$|Enzymes of {{the smooth}} ER {{can also help}} detoxify drugs and poisons. Detoxification <b>usually</b> <b>involves</b> the {{addition}} of a hydroxyl group to a drug, making the drug more soluble and thus easier to purge from the body. One extensively studied detoxification reaction is carried out by the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes, which catalyze water-insoluble drugs or metabolites that would otherwise accumulate to toxic levels in cell membrane.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{production}} of selenium <b>usually</b> <b>involves</b> {{the extraction of}} selenium dioxide from residues obtained during the purification of copper. Common production from the residue then begins by oxidation with sodium carbonate to produce selenium dioxide, which is mixed with water and acidified to form selenous acid (oxidation step). Selenous acid is bubbled with sulfur dioxide (reduction step) to give elemental selenium.|$|E
5|$|The {{winners of}} both the {{individual}} and team events receive a trophy, and the second- and third-placed individuals and teams also receive a smaller trophy. Despite claims that the game involves skill more than luck, no team or individual has ever won the competition more than once. The individual competition <b>usually</b> <b>involves</b> winning three rounds of matches before receiving an entry to the final.|$|E

5|$|A {{survival}} horror storyline <b>usually</b> <b>involves</b> {{the investigation}} and confrontation of horrific forces, and thus many games transform common elements from horror fiction into gameplay challenges. Early releases utilized camera angles seen in horror films, which allowed enemies to lurk {{in areas that are}} concealed from the player's view. Also, many survival horror games make use of off-screen sound or other warning cues to notify the player of impending danger. This feedback assists the player, but also creates feelings of anxiety and uncertainty.|$|E
5|$|Research {{motivated}} by adhesive polyphenolic proteins in mussels {{led to the}} discovery in 2007 that {{a wide variety of}} materials, if placed in a solution of dopamine at slightly basic pH, will become coated with a layer of polymerized dopamine, often referred to as polydopamine. This polymerized dopamine forms by a spontaneous oxidation reaction, and is formally a type of melanin. Synthesis <b>usually</b> <b>involves</b> reaction of dopamine hydrochloride with Tris as a base in water. The structure of polydopamine is unknown.|$|E
5|$|A {{direct method}} for {{producing}} an MSA uses the dynamic programming technique {{to identify the}} globally optimal alignment solution. For proteins, this method <b>usually</b> <b>involves</b> two sets of parameters: a gap penalty and a substitution matrix assigning scores or probabilities to the alignment of each possible pair of amino acids based on the similarity of the amino acids' chemical properties and the evolutionary probability of the mutation. For nucleotide sequences a similar gap penalty is used, but a much simpler substitution matrix, wherein only identical matches and mismatches are considered, is typical. The scores in the substitution matrix may be either all positive or a mix {{of positive and negative}} {{in the case of a}} global alignment, but must be both positive and negative, in the case of a local alignment.|$|E

In contrast with intercensal estimates and censuses, which <b>usually</b> <b>involve</b> some sort of field data gathering, projections <b>usually</b> <b>involve</b> mathematical models based only on pre-existing data may be made by a governmental organization, or by those unaffiliated with a government.|$|R
5|$|A {{high risk}} day {{indicates}} a considerable likelihood of significant to extreme severe weather, generally a major tornado outbreak or (much less often) an extreme derecho event. On these days, the potential exists for extremely severe and life-threatening weather, including widespread strong or violent tornadoes – {{some of which}} may be on the ground for a half-hour or longer – and/or very destructive straight-line winds (hail cannot verify or produce a high risk on its own, although such a day <b>usually</b> <b>involves</b> a threat for widespread very large and damaging hail as well). Many of the most prolific severe weather days were high risk days. Such days are rare; a high risk is typically issued (at the most) only a few times each year (see List of Storm Prediction Center high risk days). High risk areas are usually surrounded by a larger moderate risk area, where uncertainty is greater or the threat is somewhat lower.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{overdose}} can be acute or chronic. In acute poisoning, {{a single}} large dose is taken; in chronic poisoning, {{higher than normal}} doses are taken {{over a period of}} time. Acute overdose has a mortality rate of 2%. Chronic overdose is more commonly lethal, with a mortality rate of 25%; chronic overdose may be especially severe in children. Toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments, including activated charcoal, intravenous dextrose and normal saline, sodium bicarbonate, and dialysis. The diagnosis of poisoning <b>usually</b> <b>involves</b> measurement of plasma salicylate, the active metabolite of aspirin, by automated spectrophotometric methods. Plasma salicylate levels in general range from 30–100mg/l after usual therapeutic doses, 50–300mg/l in people taking high doses and 700–1400mg/l following acute overdose. Salicylate is also produced as a result of exposure to bismuth subsalicylate, methyl salicylate, and sodium salicylate.|$|E
5|$|Crisis Core is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} {{game in which}} the player controls Zack Fair. The player moves Zack through and between open areas, allowing him to talk with non-player characters, interact with the environment, and engage monsters in battle. At save points, the player may opt {{to take one of}} the available side missions, and if so, Zack is moved to a special area to complete the mission, which <b>usually</b> <b>involves</b> defeating one or more monsters. If the mission is successfully completed, the player is rewarded with beneficial items, and often new missions become available. Whether the player is successful in the side mission or not, upon completion, Zack is returned to the save point in the main game.|$|E
50|$|Rally racing {{occurs on}} non-circuit roads which <b>usually</b> <b>involve</b> public (closed) routes and {{technically}} challenging courses. <b>Usually</b> <b>involving</b> staggered starts, each driver competes against the clock. In addition, during rally events, a co-driver is present, constantly reading pacenotes {{to guide the}} driver along narrow and meandering tracks of up to 6 km in length.|$|R

5|$|Spinal polio, {{the most}} common form of paralytic poliomyelitis, results from viral {{invasion}} of the motor neurons of the anterior horn cells, or the ventral (front) grey matter section in the spinal column, which are responsible for movement of the muscles, including those of the trunk, limbs, and the intercostal muscles. Virus invasion causes inflammation of the nerve cells, leading to damage or destruction of motor neuron ganglia. When spinal neurons die, Wallerian degeneration takes place, leading to weakness of those muscles formerly innervated by the now-dead neurons. With the destruction of nerve cells, the muscles no longer receive signals from the brain or spinal cord; without nerve stimulation, the muscles atrophy, becoming weak, floppy and poorly controlled, and finally completely paralyzed. Maximum paralysis progresses rapidly (two to four days), and <b>usually</b> <b>involves</b> fever and muscle pain. Deep tendon reflexes are also affected, and are typically absent or diminished; sensation (the ability to feel) in the paralyzed limbs, however, is not affected.|$|E
5|$|Terns are seabirds in {{the family}} Laridae that have a {{worldwide}} distribution and are normally found near the sea, rivers, or wetlands. Terns are treated as a subgroup of the family Laridae which includes gulls and skimmers and consist of eleven genera. They are slender, lightly built birds with long, forked tails, narrow wings, long bills, and relatively short legs. Most species are pale grey above and white below, with a contrasting black cap to the head, but the marsh terns, the Inca tern, and some noddies have dark plumage for {{at least part of}} the year. The sexes are identical in appearance, but young birds are readily distinguishable from adults. Terns have a non-breeding plumage, which <b>usually</b> <b>involves</b> a white forehead and much-reduced black cap.|$|E
5|$|Warcraft: Orcs & Humans is a {{real-time}} strategy game (RTS). The player {{takes the}} role of either the Human inhabitants of Azeroth, or the invading Orcs. In the single player campaign mode the player works {{through a series of}} missions, the objective of which varies, but <b>usually</b> <b>involves</b> building a small town, harvesting resources, building an army and then leading it to victory. In multiplayer games, the objective is always to destroy the enemy players' forces. Some scenarios are complicated by the presence of wild monsters, but sometimes these monsters can be used as troops. The game plays in a medieval setting with fantasy elements. Both sides have melee units and ranged units, and also spellcasters.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere, salt is {{extracted}} from the vast sedimentary deposits which have been laid down over the millennia from the evaporation of seas and lakes. These are either mined directly, producing rock salt, or are extracted in solution by pumping water into the deposit. In either case, the salt may be purified by mechanical evaporation of brine. Traditionally, this was done in shallow open pans which were heated to increase the rate of evaporation. More recently, the process is performed in pans under vacuum. The raw salt is refined to purify it and improve its storage and handling characteristics. This <b>usually</b> <b>involves</b> recrystallization during which a brine solution is treated with chemicals that precipitate most impurities (largely magnesium and calcium salts). Multiple stages of evaporation are then used to collect pure sodium chloride crystals, which are kiln-dried. Some salt is produced using the Alberger process, which involves vacuum pan evaporation combined with the seeding of the solution with cubic crystals, and produces a grainy-type flake. The Ayoreo, an indigenous group from the Paraguayan Chaco, obtain their salt from the ash produced by burning the timber of the Indian salt tree (Maytenus vitis-idaea) and other trees.|$|E
5|$|The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) first {{listed the}} two known species of slow loris under Appendix II on 7January1975. All newly {{identified}} species {{were covered by}} Appendix II on 2April1977 when all primates were given either Appendix I or Appendix II protection. Appendix II only requires an export permit for international trade, as long as trade will not negatively impact the survival of wild populations. Most of the trade in slow lorises, however, is illegal and <b>usually</b> <b>involves</b> smuggling to Japan. The lack of legal trade reported to the CITES Secretariat {{is shown in the}} CITES trade database, where minimal trade by CITES Parties has been reported up until 2007. Regardless, slow lorises remained vulnerable to international trade under Appendix II, and the rampant Southeast Asian pet trade was another reason for concern. As a result, Cambodia proposed that slow lorises be elevated to Appendix I, which prohibits species from being traded internationally for commercial purposes and requires both import and export permits for certain types of non-commercial trade, such as scientific research. The proposal covered all three species recognized at the time—the Sunda slow loris, Bengal slow loris, and pygmy slow loris—because they have traditionally been managed collectively owing to a lack of knowledge as to how to distinguish them.|$|E
