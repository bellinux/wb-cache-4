40|$|In this study, {{we examine}} the {{stabilisation}} trades of United Rusal Company IPO’s shares listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEx) and of its Global Depository Shares (GDS) that were simultaneously listed on Euronext Paris. Using both Thomson Reuters Tick History data and the HKEx rules and regulation relating to stabilisation, we identify and analyse the trades that were very {{likely to have been}} executed by the stabilisation manager (Credit Suisse) on both markets. We identify nearly 95 % of the stabilisation trades on the Euronext Paris, with somewhat less accurate results for Hong Kong. Our results show that the stabilisation trades generated a profit equivalent to about 2. 72 % of the gross proceeds for the two lead underwriters, a profit which is bigger than their total <b>underwriting</b> <b>commission</b> of 2. 31 %...|$|E
40|$|We {{study how}} the Indian {{government}} bond market functions, {{how it has}} changed over time, and what factors help explain some of its features. Looking at the primary market, we describe how underwriting obligations are allocated to primary dealers via auction and identify several significant determinants of the <b>underwriting</b> <b>commission</b> cutoff rate, including {{the launch of the}} Negotiated Dealing System-Order Matching System (NDS-OM) electronic trading platform. Turning to the secondary market, we explore the importance of benchmark bonds, the launch of NDS-OM, the growth in trading activity, and the migration of activity from the over-the-counter (OTC) market to NDS-OM. We find that benchmark bonds, larger issues, and recently issued bonds tend to trade more actively, but that the launch of NDS-OM is associated with a reduced likelihood of a bond trading but greater trading volume conditional on trading. Benchmark bonds, larger issues, and recently issued bonds are associated with a greater share of NDS-OM trading volume (as opposed to OTC trading volume), suggesting that the NDS-OM platform is especially attractive for trading bonds with benchmark attributes...|$|E
40|$|The 1993 Japanese {{financial}} system reform allowed banks {{to enter the}} underwriting market for corporate bonds through bank-owned security subsidiaries. This paper examines empirically whether <b>underwriting</b> <b>commissions</b> and spreads for corporate bonds fell {{as a result of}} this bank entry. The empirical results show that bank entry significantly lowers <b>underwriting</b> <b>commissions.</b> Commissions charged by banks are significantly lower than those charged by investment houses. In contrast, there is no strong evidence that bond spreads are significantly lowered by bank entry. A main bank relationship between the issuing firm and the parent of a bank-owned underwriting subsidiary does not have any significant influence in commission setting or the determination of spreads{{financial system}} reform, bank entry, bank share, commission, main bank, spread, underwriting...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} factors that affect the {{likelihood}} of maintaining a stable relationship between a brokerage firm and its client funds {{and the effect of}} such a stable business relationship on analyst recommendations. We find that young funds, particularly those in small fund families, have more incentives to maintain business ties with their current brokerage firms. A common ownership affiliation between a fund and a brokerage firm or with a third institution further enhances the probability that the brokerage firm and the funds will maintain a stable relationship. More importantly, analysts issue more optimistic recommendations on stocks that are held by their brokerage firms&# 039; stably related funds (SRFs) than on stocks that are held by other funds. The effect is more pronounced after excluding large firms. The results are robust after controlling for <b>underwriting</b> relation, <b>commission</b> fees, funds&# 039; shareholding and other factors...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} extends {{theory and}} empirical research on Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) {{to include the}} unique context faced by underwriters that have the flexibility to overprice cold offerings. First, it argues that underwriters have the incentive to deliberately overprice weakly-received offerings in order to avert potential withdrawal of the offerings and loss of <b>underwriting</b> <b>commissions.</b> It then empirically tests this argument and finds supporting evidence. Measuring underwriter pricing intention by the NASDAQ-adjusted percentage change from the offer price to the closing price three days prior {{to the end of}} the quiet period, we find deliberate overpricing to be more pronounced for offerings that end up priced exactly at the lower boundary of the preliminary price range, especially when the ex ante withdrawal probability is high or when the lower boundary represents a smaller percent drop from the range’s midpoint. The dissertation then examines the effect of IPO overpricing on the long-term prospects of the underwriters. It empirically demonstrates that overpricing offerings to avert withdrawal not only increases the payoff to the underwriter from the respective deals but also enhances the underwriter’s share of future IPO business. In particular, it finds that banks which engage issuers with a higher ex ante propensity to withdraw, and then aggressively price the offerings to actually avert withdrawal, experience a pronounced increase in their future IPO market share. Such reward is not experienced by underwriters which at the outset avoid engaging issuers with high likelihood of withdrawal. The dissertation also finds that withdrawals have more of an adverse effect on future market share than does mere overpricing. Furthermore, when overpricing is accompanied by even a low level of price support during first-day of public trading, the effect on the bank’s future market share is significantly less adverse than that associated with otherwise letting the offer be withdrawn. The dissertation extends the IPO bookbuilding theory by developing a model which encompasses the potential for IPO withdrawal, overpricing, and aftermarket price support altogether, and solving for the equilibrium offer-price-maximizing price/allocation schedule. The analysis shows that overpricing can be sustained in equilibrium in a manner that still ensures maximized proceeds to the issuer. The optimal price/allocation rule calls for allocation priority to be given to investors with strong indications of interest; underpricing to occur when premarket demand is strong; and overpricing to be resorted to only as needed to avert withdrawal by the issuer in lukewarmly-received offerings. Aftermarket price stabilization plays two roles in equilibrium: It bonds the underwriter against deliberate overpricing when premarket demand is either strong or too weak; and it adequately compensates investors when overpricing is utilized to avert issue withdrawal...|$|R

New supply {{contracts}} with Japanese, German and American power utilities prompted this re-opening, with Mary Kathleen's second life extended to 1982 when reserves were finally exhausted. [...] The company made a share issue to raise capital, and the Commonwealth Government, through the Australian Atomic Energy <b>Commission</b> <b>underwrote</b> this, thereby obtaining a 42% holding in the company. Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Limited, a successor of Rio Tinto Mining, held 51%, and the public 7%.

40|$|I {{designed}} my composition Bound, and {{its premiere}} performance, {{to serve as}} the most substantive and holistic creative endeavor possible. To achieve this goal, I used funds from the Rackham school of music to <b>underwrite</b> the <b>commission</b> original poetry from Lauren Clark, an award-winning MFA student in Creative Writing here at the University of Michigan. Moreover, I also used these funds to hire Megan Ihnen, an internationally-renowned mezzo-soprano who specializes in contemporary music, and four members of Latitude 49, an accomplished Midwest-based new music ensemble, to perform Bound in March, 2015. I programmed a full-length recital of my chamber music at First Presbyterian Church in Ypsilanti, MI at which Bound’s premiere acted as the closing and crowning performance. Finally, I arranged for an experienced audio engineer produce a professional-grade recording of the entire recital. I worked on Bound for eight months from the point I received Lauren’s newly- commissioned poetry, to the final changes I made leading up to the premiere on March 14, 2015. Bound’s longest three movements, “Bound”, “Bound III”, and “Bound V”, each sets a different poem of Lauren’s, which I altered only slightly to fit my musical ideas as best a possible. However, the five shorter movements, dubbed “interludes”, use texts excerpted and adapted from a fourth poem of Lauren’s, “Bound VI”. Thus, Bound’s three long movements are meant to act as the work’s structural and narrative pillars, with the five interludes connecting and supplementing Bound’s musical and lyrical storytelling. I consider Bound a major work because of its length, meticulous structure, and the complexity of its textual themes. Bound investigates the we try to make sense of and protect ourselves from the trauma we experience when our meaningful relationships dissolve. From its instrumentation to its fundamental motives, every aspect of Bound’s sound world is designed to convey the nuance and continuity of Lauren’s poetry, which is simultaneously somber, wistful, and ardent. I believe Bound clearly respects the abstract and naturalistic imagery of the original text, while also conveying the poetry’s deeper narrative of vulnerability, loss, and memory...|$|R
