In general. there was not a disproportionate number of average students remaining on the campuses after 2 years (as had been anticipated). although more of those below average left. Academic ability was unrelated to withdrawal in a linear way. Reasons for leaving were related to the types of students. The campus environments were distinct in that different reasons applied to the same types of students at different campuses. Forty percent of all the students had left by Fall 1 % 7.
