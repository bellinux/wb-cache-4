50|$|An {{easement}} or {{license to}} drill for oil, gas, or minerals generally runs with the land, {{and thus is}} an appurtenant easement.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{disturbance}} regime (time since last fi re or slashing) on the vulnerable plant species, Darwinia glaucophylla, was assessed on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia. The abundance, growth and fl owering of D. glaucophylla adults and abundance {{and growth of}} seedlings was measured within sites that had either been recently burnt (≤ 5 years), long unburnt (≥ 14 years) or regularly slashed (30 cm above ground) along a <b>utility</b> <b>easement.</b> Our results showed that D. glaucophylla was most abundant at slashed sites, followed by recently burnt sites; it was present but not abundant at unslashed sites that were burnt ≥ 14 years ago. Seedlings were only found at one, recently burnt site. Disturbance regime had no signifi cant effect on the timing or density of fl owering. Fruit collected from sites with different disturbance regimes did not germinate after exposure to various combinations of heat, smoke-water and/or scarifi cation. Recently burnt sites contained plants producing a signifi cantly greater number of viable fruits compared to those from other disturbance regimes. Fire and slashing altered the habitat of D. glaucophylla in different ways. Our fi ndings suggest that slashing promotes favourable conditions for adults by creating a habitat with higher light and less competition. However, it is not apparent whether these same conditions are favourable for seedling recruitment...|$|E
40|$|In the {{northern}} parts of Sweden forestry and Sami reindeer herding are exercised {{on the same}} land {{and there is an}} ongoing land use dispute between the land users. Land ownership and reindeer herding rights, based on immemorial prescription and customary law, are parallel property rights to the same land. Studies have concluded that the legal framework does not sufficiently reflect the property rights perspective of the land use conflict. This study examines the legal framework that regulates the relationship between forestry and reindeer herding from a property rights perspective. Starting points of the study are basic aspects of property rights, such as the right to use, decide on and benefit economically from property and the legal protection required in relation to others. Comparisons are made with the legal frameworks that regulate other relationships within real estate law, including e. g. neighbors, easements, joint facilities and <b>utility</b> <b>easement.</b> The study concludes that the relationship between land ownership and reindeer herding rights can be understood only against the background of historical events such as colonization and demarcation. The rights are more independent of each other than other legal relations and can be compared to a double ownership. It is further concluded that the Forestry Act {{is based on the assumption}} that reindeer herding is primarily a public interest that needs protection. Land owners have a far-reaching right to use forests that causes damages to reindeer pasture lands that is not in accordance with the legal nature of the reindeer herding right. Further, central elements usually used to regulate property rights relations are missing, e. g. mutual consideration, damages and judicial review. The study also examines if the legal framework is in accordance with the constitutional protection of property in Chapter 2 Section 15 of the constitutional Instrument of Government and Article 1 of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights. It is concluded that the legal framework has several deficiencies in this respect. Elements are discussed that can be implemented in law to appropriately reflect the property rights studied.

The electricity grid {{is divided into three}} different sizes; the core network, the regional network and the local network. The electricity grid {{is an important part of}} the infrastructure, and it should be legally protected through for example, <b>utility</b> <b>easement</b> or agreement easement [...] Issues may arise about the legal rights of power lines such as when a transfer occurs, etc. Thus it is important to examine how the power lines should be legally protected. The purpose of the study is to examine how the electricity companies legally protect their power lines, as well as the pros and cons of the legal rights, based on the aspects of electricity companies and cadastral authorities. The purpose is also to highlight the most common issue regarding the legal rights on power lines. The questions that were formulated according to the purpose were: How do electricity companies legally protect their power lines? What are the pros and cons of the legal rights based on the views of electricity companies and surveyors? What is the most common problem that electric companies have about legal rights of power lines? By using a qualitative method in form of an interview study, the data for the study has been obtained. The interview study consisted of 16 interviews with experts from electricity companies and cadastral authorities. As the study should cover all of Sweden, electricity companies and land surveyors were selected with a geographical spread. The study shows that electricity companies legally protect their power lines depending on their size. The study also shows the differences between the electricity companies and the cadastral authorities ́ views on the pros and cons of the legal rights. Issues may occur depending on who owns the land where the lines are to be constructed. ...|$|E

40|$|My thesis {{project is}} to create a {{conservation}} plan for the Reservoir Canyon Natural Reserve (RCNR) in San Luis Obispo, California. It is a professional project for the City of San Luis Obispo with the goal of eventual adoption by the City Council. The plan was motivated by City policy, which advises creating conservation plans for open spaces, and by a particular need to address management issues in RCNR that include plant and wildlife conservation, trail access, erosion, electrical <b>utility</b> <b>easements,</b> and other legal matters. The project consists of two main components: the conservation plan and a companion paper. The paper is an overview of the theory and best practices involved in conservation planning, and is meant to be complementary to the conservation plan. Therefore, discussions found in the paper are not present in the plan itself, but instead serve as background. The paper consists primarily of a literature review and my reflections on how the literature applies to the process of planning and managing RCNR. The Draft Reservoir Canyon Natural Reserve Conservation Plan, attached as an appendix, explains the conditions of the reserve, and describes the goals and management strategies the City will employ...|$|R
