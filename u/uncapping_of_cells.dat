40|$|Two {{behaviors}} of honey bees, hygienic behavior and grooming, are mechanisms {{of defense against}} brood diseases and parasitic mites. Studies have shown that Apis mellifera colonies remove worker brood infested with Varroa jacobsoni mites from the nest (hygienic behavior), and groom the mites off other adult bees, but to a limited extent compared to the original host of V. jacobsoni, A. cerana.

Studies have shown that it is involved in both, adaptive responses and apoptosis. The current study focuses on the role of p 38 MAP kinase in two different stress situations—preconditioning and ischemia. Using rat myoblast cell fine H 9 C 2 and in-vitro model of metabolically induced ischemia we found that p 38 MAP kinase is activated by both, preconditioning stimuli and by lethal ischemic insult. Paradoxically, it plays a protective role in preconditioning and a deleterious role in lethal insult. In preconditioning, we found that p 38 MAP kinase is activated, and phosphorylates small heat shock protein HSP 25. This leads to <b>uncapping</b> <b>of</b> F-actin and polymerization of G-actin to F-actin. We propose that it is the stabilization of actin filaments during the recovery, which enables it to withstand the second insult. On the other hand during lethal ischemia, the <b>uncapping</b> <b>of</b> F-actin in presence of continuous stress leads to depolymerization and destabilization of F-actin, which contributes to the deleterious effects.

40|$|AbstractActin {{polymerization}} {{is essential}} {{for a variety of}} cellular processes including movement, cell division and shape change. The induction of actin polymerization requires the generation of free actin filament barbed ends, which results from the severing or <b>uncapping</b> <b>of</b> pre-existing actin filaments [1, 2], or de novo nucleation, initiated by the Arp 2 / 3 complex [3 – 7]. Although {{little is known about the}} signaling pathways that regulate actin assembly, small GTPases of the Rho family appear to be necessary [8 – 11]. In thrombin-stimulated platelets, the Rho family GTPase Rac 1 induces actin polymerization by stimulating the <b>uncapping</b> <b>of</b> actin filament barbed ends [2]. The mechanism by which Rac regulates uncapping is unclear, however. We previously demonstrated that Rac interacts with a type I phosphatidylinositol- 4 -phosphate 5 -kinase (PIP 5 -kinase) in a GTP-independent manner [12, 13]. Because PIP 5 -kinases synthesize phosphatidylinositol- 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PI(4, 5) P 2), a lipid that dissociates capping proteins from the barbed ends of actin filaments [14 – 16], they are good candidates for mediating the effects of Rac on actin assembly. Here, we have identified the Rac-associated PIP 5 -kinase as the PIP 5 -kinase isoforms α and β. When added to permeabilized platelets, PIP 5 -kinase α induced actin filament uncapping and assembly. In contrast, a kinase-inactive PIP 5 -kinase α mutant failed to induce actin assembly and blocked assembly stimulated by thrombin or Rac. Furthermore, thrombin- or Rac-induced actin polymerization was inhibited by a point mutation in the carboxyl terminus of Rac that disrupts PIP 5 -kinase binding. These results demonstrate that PIP 5 -kinase α is a critical mediator of thrombin- and Rac-dependent actin assembly...|$|R

Another key player for the formation of filopodia across many species is vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). It has been proposed that the essential role of VASP for formation of filopodia is its competition with capping proteins for filament barbed-end interaction. To better understand the function of VASP in filopodium formation, we analyzed the in vitro and in vivo properties of Dictyostelium VASP (DdVASP) and extended our findings to human VASP. Recombinant VASP from both species nucleated and bundled actin filaments, but did not compete with capping proteins or block depolymerization from barbed ends.

In cells and extracts, GTPγS and Rho-family GTPases, including Cdc 42, stimulate barbed-end actin polymerization; however, the mechanism {{responsible for the}} initiation of polymerization is unknown. There are three formal possibilities for how free barbed ends may be generated in response to cellular signals: <b>uncapping</b> <b>of</b> existing filaments; severing of existing filaments; or de novo nucleation. The Arp 2 / 3 complex localizes to regions of dynamic actin polymerization, including the leading edges <b>of</b> motile <b>cells</b> and motile actin patchesin yeast, and in vitro it nucleates the formation of actin filaments with free barbed ends. Here, we investigated actin polymerization in soluble extracts of Acanthamoeba. Results: Addition of actin filaments with free barbed ends to Acanthamoeba extracts is sufficient to induce polymerization of endogenous actin. Addition of activated Cdc 42 or activation of Rho-family GTPases in these extracts by the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog GTPγS stimulated barbed-end polymerization, whereas immunodepletion of Arp 2 or sequestration of Arp 2 using solution-binding antibodies blocked Rho-family GTPase-induced actin polymerization.
