There was a highly significant effect of soil type, copper treatment and oxytetracycline/captan treatment. The initial respiration rate of chronically zinc-polluted soil was higher than that of <b>unpolluted</b> <b>soil,</b> but in the copper treatment it showed a greater decline.

The experiment design was factorial randomized block design with 2 factors and 3 replications. First factor was Pb-polluted azolla biomass with 3 treatments 0 g/kg, 15 g/kg and 30 g/kg, second factor was Pb application with 3 treatments 0 ppm/kg, 150 ppm/kg, and 300 ppm/kg. The parameters was soil pH, organic matter. Pb total and available Pb from 1 week and 2 weeks after applying Pb-polluted azolla. The result showed that application of Pb-polluted azolla biomass increased 20 % and 30 % the availability of Pb after 1 week compare to control for Pb-polluted azolla treatment 15 g/kg and 30 g/kg respectively. Application of Pb-polluted azolla biomass did not significantly affected the soil pH and increasing soil organic matter. Meanwhile application of Pb polluted azolla biomass on <b>unpolluted</b> <b>soil</b> increased Pb-available about 60 % and 85 % compare to control for azolla biomass applying 15 g/kg and 30 g/kg, and also increasing soil organic matter content.

40|$|The {{effect of}} crude oil on the growth of legumes (Calopogonium muconoides and Centrosema pubescens) and fate of nitrogen-fixing {{bacteria}} in wetland ultisol was investigated using standard cultural techniques. The results revealed observable effects of oil on soil physico-chemistry, plant growth and nodulation {{as well as on}} densities of heterotrophic, hydrocarbonoclastic and nitrogen fixing bacteria. The effects however varied with different levels (0. 5 %, 1 %, 5 %, 10 %, 15 % and 20 %) of pollution. Ammonium and nitrate levels were high in the <b>unpolluted</b> <b>soil</b> but decreased with increase in pollution levels. Nitrite was not detected in contaminated soil probably due to the reduction in numbers of nitrogen fixers, from 5. 26  ±  0. 23  × l 06 cfu/g in <b>unpolluted</b> <b>soil</b> to 9. 0  ±  0. 12  ×  105 and 2. 2  ±  0. 08  × l 05 cfu/g in soils with 5 % and 20 % levels of pollution respectively. The contaminated soil also exhibited gross reduction in the nodulation of legumes. A range of 13 – 57 nodules was observed in legumes from polluted soil against 476 nodules recorded for plants cultured on <b>unpolluted</b> <b>soil.</b> The heterogeneity of the microbial loads between oil-polluted and <b>unpolluted</b> <b>soil</b> were statistically significant (p <  0. 05, ANOVA). Positive significant relationships were observed between the levels of hydrocarbons and the densities of heterotrophic bacteria (r =  0. 91) and that of hydrocarbon utilizing bacteria (r =  0. 86). On the other hand, relationships between the densities of nitrogen fixing bacteria and total hydrocarbons content was negative (r = − 0. 30) while positive relationships were recorded between the densities of different microbial groups and treatment periods except at 15 % and 20 % pollution levels. The LSD tests revealed highly significant differences (p <  0. 001) in the physiological groups of soil microorganisms at all levels of pollution. The results imply that crude oil seriously affects rhizosphere microbial growth in legumes. Among the bacterial species isolated, Clostridium pasteurianum, Bacillus polymyxa and Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibited greater ability to degrade hydrocarbons than Azotobacter sp, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Derxia gummusa while Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter had the least degradability.

40|$|The copper smelter "Legnica" {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} plants in Lower Silesia. Among the few weed species spontaneously {{migrating}} to the area around the emitter there is couch grass (Agropyron repens (L.) P. Bauv.). The purpose of this study was to analyse whether the local couch grass populations, growing at various distances from the smelter, differ in tolerance to heavy metals occurring in this area. The populations were tested for tolerance to five metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, Ni) using the root elongation method. The highest tolerance to Pb developed in two populations localized nearest the smelter. Similarly, all populations of couch grass from the vicinity of the smelter show a high tolerance to copper, particularly the plants from the most contaminated site. The IT for the latter population is almost 1509 r, even at the highest dose of Cu. For Zn a nearing IT as for Cu was obtained. Comparing the shape of IT curves for Cd, special emphasis is put on the fact that a fixed tolerance to cadmium occurs only in the population localized closest to the emitter. The analysis of Ni-tolerance curves, of which the content in local soil is minimal, does not confirm the thesis on possibility of development of co-tolerance in the surveyed populations. It appeared that stress conditions existing near the smelter do not inhibit seed production in couch grass, but prevent a successful course of their germination on polluted soil. The improvement of soil even by 50 % (addition of <b>unpolluted</b> <b>soil)</b> does not improve the poor process of germination in couch grass growing nearest to the smelter. Of importance is the fact that the highest number of seeds germinated on their own, polluted soil. The need of metals' content for plant germination in populations most distant from the smelter is evidenced by an almost 30 % reduction of germination ability of local seeds after addition of <b>unpolluted</b> <b>soil.</b> Another significant observation was the fact that, in spite of a poor germination of seeds on <b>unpolluted</b> <b>soil,</b> the further development of seedlings in populations more distant from the smelter was more intense and faster than on their native polluted soil. Thus, a certain amount of metals may stimulate the germination processes of seeds in tolerant populations, but on the other hand, it may be a hindrance to subsequent juvenile phases. During observations of development of rhizomes, taken from three polluted couch grass populations cultivated on <b>unpolluted</b> <b>soil,</b> in all of them a very slow development of rhizome buds was recorded. However, the slowest rate of appearance of buds was found in the population taken nearest the emitter which, in greenhouse conditions and at lack of metals in soil, showed a markedly poor tendency toward vegetative reproduction. All the contaminated populations display a high activity of peroxidase in leaves and roots, frequently more than twice as high than in control populations. The activity of catalase is also markedly higher, but only in two of the most contaminated populations.

Total genomic DNA was extracted directly from these samples. PCR followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), augmented by cloning and sequencing, as well as direct sequencing techniques, was all used to investigate AMF community structure. We found a decreased diversity of native AMF (assessed by the number of AMF ribotypes) in soils and plant roots harvested from TM-polluted <b>soils</b> compared with <b>unpolluted</b> <b>soils.</b> We also found that community structure was modified by TM contamination. Various species of Glomus, Scutellospora aurigloba and S.  calospora were the most abundant ribotypes detected in unpolluted soil; ribotypes of G.  etunicatum, G.  irregulare/G.  intraradices and G.  viscosum were found in both polluted and <b>unpolluted</b> <b>soils,</b> while ribotypes of G.  mosseae and Glomus spp. (B 9 and B 13) were dominant in TM-polluted soils.

The spores germination and hyphal growth for both isolates showed a variable responses to different concentrations of Zn, Cd and Pb. Only, Zn at low concentrations increased germination percentage and hyphal growth for both isolates spores compared to control (without metal) and this effect was more pronounced with the spores isolated from polluted soil. Germination of the spores isolated from polluted soil were more tolerant to Zn, Cd and Pb than the spores from unpolluted, with EC 50 values of 76, 34 and 14 μ mol L‾ 1 for the former isolate and 30, 16 and 6 μmol L‾ 1 for the later to Zn, Cd and Pb respectively. Interaction between metals singly or in combination of 2 or 3 metals (at EC 50 values) showed variation in sensitivity to Zn, Cd and Pb.

Similar to nutrients, pollutants may be transported among connected ramets via physiological integration. Few {{studies have examined the}} expansion of amphibious clonal plants from terrestrial to aquatic environments, particularly when the local water supply is polluted with heavy metals. A greenhouse experiment was conducted using the amphibious plant Alternanthera philoxeroides to determine whether Cu can spread among clonal plants and examine the corresponding effects of this pollution on the expansion of clonal plants in aquatic-terrestrial ecotones. Ramets from the same clonal fragments were rooted in <b>unpolluted</b> <b>soil</b> and polluted water at five different levels. The responses of the ramets in terrestrial and aquatic habitats were quantified via traits associated with growth, morphology and Cu accumulation. The results indicated that ramets in soil and water significantly differed in nearly all of these traits. The expansion of populations from terrestrial to polluted aquatic habitats was facilitated by stem elongation rather than new ramet production. The accumulated Cu in polluted ramets can be horizontally transported to other ramets in soil via connected stolons. In terms of clonal growth patterns, variations in Cu pollution intensity were negatively correlated with variations in the morphological and growth traits of ramets in polluted aquatic habitats and <b>unpolluted</b> <b>soil.</b> We concluded that Cu ions are distributed among the clones and accumulated in different ramet tissues in heterogeneous habitats.

Potential effects on metal trace element concentration from lysimeter outflow due to lysimeter building material components were investigated by comparing lysimeter outflow concentrations with concentrations of surface near groundwater. Some lysimeters could not be used for further investigation. Finally we selected lysimeters with 16 different soils for further examinations, which lasted up to 3 years. 43 trace elements were analysed in 340 seepage water samples and 53 soil samples. To get a realistic picture of the variability of the trace element concentration of seepage water pouring from <b>unpolluted</b> <b>soils</b> it is useful to determine the median of the analysed samples. The median concentrations could be used as background values. They are all below the limits of the German soil protection decree.

The investigations of these <b>unpolluted</b> <b>soils</b> show that there is no obvious correlation between the concentrations of the eluation methods. A comparison of these concentrations with the median of the concentrations from the seepage water likewise shows no direct correlations. Only soil samples below 60 cm depth could be used for this comparison.

40|$|Background: Consortia of {{specifically}} selected {{bacteria are}} often used in open fields for bioremediation purposes. However, a clear evaluation of {{the efficiency of the}} system requires detailed investigation. Objectives: The main objective of this work was to evaluate the efficiency of a bacterial consortium in reducing diesel fuel content of soil. Since the soil adopted for this investigation was coming from a real site interested by a long-term fuel spill, a well established oil tolerant and oil degrading microflora was supposed to be already present. Methods: Lab-scale biopiles were assembled with long term diesel fuel polluted soil and with <b>unpolluted</b> <b>soil</b> artificially contaminated with the same hydrocarbon. Inoculated and not inoculated samples were organized. Microbial community composition was determined by DGGE analysis. Results: DNA analysis performed on the long-term contaminated soil showed that the profile related to the inoculant by itself did not cluster with any of the profiles obtained from the biopiles. Since both the inoculated and not inoculated biopiles seems to be active in the biodegradation process, this could be due to the autochthonous microflora that experienced a strong and continuous selective pressure during 30 years polluted soil. After so long time the microbial community evolved in a hydrocarbon resistent and actively degrading population, so well established in that soil to prevent effective colonization b y newly introduced bacterial population. On the other hand, the results obtained from the <b>unpolluted</b> <b>soil</b> that was artificially contaminated, indicated that the bacterial consortium there released was able to colonize that soil and actively break down hydrocarbons. Conclusions: This results may suggest that the use of bacterial consortia could have chance to successfully perform i f promptly applied after the occurrence of the contamination, while long-term polluted soils would be much less receptive to newly introduced inoculants...|$|E

40|$|Fossil fuels are {{currently}} the primary industrial energy source on Earth. They are principally composed of complex hydrocarbons in either long-chain or cyclic conformation. Industrial use of petroleum, diesel, oil, tar and other coal-derived products inevitably leads to pollution of the environment. The most serious pollution {{is caused by}} polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that are not easily removed from soil after a spill. Long-chain and cyclic conformation makes fossil fuel hydrocarbons difficult to break down. However, certain free-living soil microorganisms have adapted to utilising these PAHs/PCBs {{as a source of}} energy. In many cases, their efficacy is greatly enhanced by the presence of plants. By inhabiting the rhizosphere, microbes form a mutualistic relationship with the plant, receiving nutrients from it and in return providing a less polluted environment in which the plant can grow. The {{purpose of this study was}} to elucidate some of the microbial population diversity in PAH/PCB-polluted soils in South Africa through the use of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). In an initial study, DGGE was employed to separate soil communities in polluted and <b>unpolluted</b> <b>soils</b> into a genetic fingerprint, the main bands of which were sequenced and subjected to a BLAST analysis through a database for possible identification of species present. Phylogenetic and distance studies indicated that <b>unpolluted</b> <b>soils</b> have a far greater species diversity. It thus was evident that PAH/PCB pollution of soil leads to a decrease in microbial diversity by selecting for microorganisms with the ability to activate metabolic pathways allowing them to utilise the pollutants as an alternative source of carbon. Population diversity of pro- and eukaryotes found within polluted and non-polluted soils was compared. DGGE was employed to determine the genetic fingerprint of each population. Following this, dendogram analyses based on Shannon indices were done to determine PAH breakdown potential of prokaryotic vs. eukaryotic communities. A higher diversity and better adaptation potential were evident within prokaryotic than eukaryotic communities in pollution-stressed environments, indicating that the prokaryotic component of these samples had the greatest PAH-metabolism potential. To determine the capacity for PAH/PCB metabolism by the organisms within the soil samples being studied, the presence of xylE and ndoB genes, responsible for toluene/xylene and naphthalene biodegradation, respectively, was determined. DGGE was performed to analyse genetic diversity between these two genes, based on community fingerprints. Polluted soil communities tended to have comparable community diversity within their functional genes, depending on their physical situation, plant species proximity and soil conditions. In general, soil contained indigenous microbes with a high natural potential for biodegradation of PAHs/PCBs. A portion of the 16 S gene of eight bacterial isolates representing the most dominant culturable taxa in the polluted soils was sequenced and analysed for identification purposes. These identifications were conducted in conjunction with the use of the catabolic gene probes xylE and ndoB to establish the hydrocarbon degrading capacity of the isolates. Pseudomonas, from the rhizosphere of Cyperus esculentus, was the most common PAH-degrading genus found in this study. Considering the well-established rhizosphere competence and PAH-degrading capacity of Pseudomonas, this genus seems to be the best suited for bioaugmentation purposes in South Africa. The presence of the nifH gene, the general marker gene of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in communities from <b>unpolluted</b> and polluted <b>soils,</b> was determined. It was hypothesised that bioremediation could be enhanced by nitrogen addition to polluted environments. Nested-PCR of the nifH gene was conducted on a diagnostic basis and was followed by DGGE of the product to determine the functional gene diversity within pollution-dwelling, nitrogen-fixing bacterial communities. Nitrogen-fixing microorganisms were present in all the soils sampled but, in only 80 % of the pure cultures isolated from polluted and <b>unpolluted</b> <b>soils</b> and rhizospheres. Although different rhizospheres and pollutants were examined, it was found that of the polluted soils studied, most nifH gene diversity of polluted soils existed within machinery oil polluted, wood chip mulched, non-rhizosphere soil. Thus, it would appear that the more polluted the soil the higher the free microbe nitrogen fixation diversity possibly due to environmental stress.

40|$|Abstract: Data {{referring}} to abundance, contamination level {{and content of}} heavy metals in labile and stable fractions of agricultural soils in Adogo in Ajaokuta local Government Area of Kogi State, Nigeria are presented. Six heavy metals were analyzed (Cd, Cu, Mg, Ni, Pb, and Zn) using Flame Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. Assessing the concentration of potentially harmful heavy metals in agricultural soil is imperative in order to evaluate the potential risks to residents. Total metal concentrations fit in the typical concentration ranges for <b>unpolluted</b> <b>soils.</b> Speciation {{studies were carried out}} by applying Tessiers procedure, which allows subdividing the total metal content into five fractions, representing portions bound to different components of the soil. The average contents of Cd, Cu, Mg, Ni, Pb, and Zn in surface soils (0 - 15 cm depth) were Cd < 0. 01, Cu 0. 89 ± 0. 25, Mg 0. 07 ± 0. 001, Ni 0. 18 ± 0. 03, Pb 0. 44 ± 0. 1 6 and 0. 04 ± 0. 003 µg/g. The soils could not be said to be contaminated for now because metal content levels conformed to the world-wide background content of metals range in the soil...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{pollution}} by cement is {{a serious}} problem and its effects on humans and plants have warranted careful attention in Libya in recent years {{as well as in the}} rest of the world, whereas the effects on fungi have not been investigated enough. This research aimed to investigate effects of cement dust pollution on fungal populations and how cement dust influences fungal growth. Soils and leaves from a cement-dust-polluted area near the Alkomos cement factory in Libya were studied. The physiochemical characteristics of soils in the study area indicate a strong influence by cement dusts that have settled 011 the soil from the cement factory. Calcium content and pH were higher than in similar <b>unpolluted</b> <b>soils</b> in this region. The dominance of fungi of soil and leaves was lowest at 100 m from the factory and the evenness and diversity increased at this site compared to the control area and 250 m from the factory. Variability and diversity of fungi were greater in the Summer (dry season) than the winter (rainy season). Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Fusarium were the most prevalent fungi isolated from contaminated samples. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The {{decomposition}} of alder (Alnus glutinosa) and poplar (Populus tremula) leaf litter placed in {{direct contact with}} non-polluted and metal-polluted soil was investigated over 25 months in a controlled model-ecosystem experiment using the litterbag method. In addition to mass loss, we monitored the total and soluble concentrations of carbon, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb. Leaves from trees grown on polluted soil had larger initial Zn, Cd and dissolved organic carbon concentrations. Neither the origin of the leaves (from trees grown on non-polluted or polluted soil) nor the placement of the leaves in polluted or <b>unpolluted</b> <b>soil</b> affected the decomposition process. Total metal contents increased in leaves placed on polluted soil over time. The solubility of metals in the leaf litter decreased over time, indicating that leaves acted as a temporary pool for metals from the soil {{in direct contact with}} the leaves. The sorbed metals were strongly bound in the litter even after two years of decomposition. The strong binding and thus reduced bioavailability of the metals provides an explanation for why they had no observable effects on litter decomposition...|$|E
40|$|The main aim in {{this study}} is to assess the level of heavy metals {{concentration}} in soil profile and their mobility in the presence of pH and organic carbon,where polluted water is used in agriculture. The samples of soil collected at different sites across Vrishabhavathi river valley have been analyzed for heavy metals, viz. Pb, Zn, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Fe and Mn using atomic absorption spectrophotometer. These values assessed with respect to reference soil taken from <b>unpolluted</b> <b>soil</b> profile. The heavy metals studied at all sampling sites compared with Indian Standards and all heavy metals are below permissible limits. The concentration of all the metals is high compared to the soil sample taken from unpolluted site shows the build up of heavy metal concentration using polluted water in irrigation. The % of organic carbon varies from 1. 9 to 2. 9 % in top layer and 1 to 1. 6 % in the subsequent layer. The pH value is higher on top layer soil and decreases in subsequent layer...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{samples were}} {{collected}} from three land use types within Baghdad urban areas. The samples analyzed for Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn indicated higher concentration of Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb and Zn in the industrial area, while higher concentration of Mn was observed in the residential areas. However, the concentration of Cd, Ni and Pb was higher than the calculated worldwide mean of <b>unpolluted</b> <b>soil.</b> For both roadside and open areas soils, industrial area exhibited high values of Cd, Ni and Pb. The highest Single Element Pollution Index (SEPI) for Cd, Ni and Pb in the industrial soils seems therefore to be {{that this type of}} soil is the most polluted in the city of Baghdad. The calculated Combined Pollution Index (CPI) for Cd, Ni and Pb ranged from 0. 98 to 2. 15 with a mean of 1. 28 for the entire urban soil samples, with the highest values in the industrial area which suggest multi-element contamination and in some cases are recommended for treatment. Furthermore, significant to extremely high values of enrichment factors were recorded confirming an important role of anthropogenic pollution. </p...|$|E

The effects {{of the differences in}} traffic conditions, build-up/land use and the density of vegetation on the heavy metal content of the soils have been examined in city of Debrecen and its closer environment. Cadmium-, cobalt-, nickel-, lead-, and copper-contents of the soil samples taken from 88 sites of the sample area have been studied after acidic extraction, using atomic absorption spectrometer with the flame technique. Close-to-background concentrations of heavy metals in <b>unpolluted</b> <b>soils</b> of the forested area of the Nagyerd were determined. Spatial differences in the heavy metal content of the soils for the whole area of Debrecen have been studied. Influence of soil properties (humus, Calcium- Carbonate content, pH and grain-size distribution) on the binding and mobility of heavy metals in the soil has been examined. Vertical distribution and mobility of heavy metal compounds in acid sandy soils was determined. Heavy metal content of soil in the most sensitive areas, playgrounds, recreational areas, urban gardens and grazing fields along busy roads has been surveyed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- There {{are many}} key {{opportunities}} {{for improving the}} export and competitive performances of the sector of ecological certified products. Romania has great openings for promoting and developing the ecological agriculture due to an agricultural area of 14. 8 million hectares and <b>unpolluted</b> <b>soils.</b> The project of Social Enterprise from Garda de Jos, Alba County, Romania is among the examples of how can be increased the product value, open new markets and export medicinal plants ecological certified. The procedure can be extended to other natural resources. This study presents the general criteria regarding how should be organized and obtained a biological certification for a natural resource, {{in this case a}} medicinal plant, Arnica montana. The procedure is addressed to the requesters of the biological certification because {{only a small part of}} them know the correct method. In author’s opinion, it is no other detailed work to support the producers and exporters of ecological certified products. The project for Arnica Montana was conducted under WWF supervision.

40|$|Copper (Cu) -polluted and <b>unpolluted</b> <b>soils</b> {{were used}} to study the effect of initial {{pollution}} on soil biological resistance and resilience by measuring the responses to perturbation using different parameters. Microbial biomass carbon, substrate-induced respiration and copy numbers of 16 S rRNA gene were grouped as general parameters, while potential ammonia oxidation rate and copy numbers of amoA gene were grouped as specific functions. In addition, to illustrate how initial pollution affects soil biological resistance and resilience following secondary perturbation, the microbial community structure, together with free Cu 2 + activities ([Cu 2 +]) in soil pore water and soil pH were also measured after secondary perturbation. Results showed that general parameters were more stable than specific ones. High [Cu 2 +] and low pH in soil pore water induced by Cu addition may lead to apparently low resistance and resilience, whereas {{the formation of a}} tolerant community after Cu pollution, secondary perturbation and Cu aging may contribute to resistance and resilience. Analysis of the phospholipid fatty acids profile showed that microbial community structure shifted along with the [Cu 2 +] gradient. The microbial community structure of the control soil was both resistant and resilient to 400 mg kg(- 1) Cu perturbation, whereas other treatments were neither resistant nor resilient...|$|R
