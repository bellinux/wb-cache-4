40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the spatial and {{temporal}} relationship between bilateral foci of bilaterally synchronous discharges in benign rolandic epilepsy of childhood (BREC) using a whole-scalp neuromagnetometer. We simultaneously recorded interictal magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and electroencephalographic (EEG) signals in six children with BREC. Interictal spikes were classified into three groups: bilaterally synchronous <b>discharges</b> (BSDs), <b>unilateral</b> <b>discharges</b> on right side (UD-R), and <b>unilateral</b> <b>discharges</b> on left side (UD-L). We used equivalent current dipole (ECD) modelling to analyse the cortical sources of interictal spikes. Both BSDs and UDs were found in Patients 1 – 4, whereas only UDs were identified in Patients 5 and 6. The ECDs of interictal spikes were located in rolandic regions, 10 – 20 mm anterior and lateral to hand somatosensory cortices. Multi-dipole analysis of BSDs showed two ECDs in homotopic motor areas of the hemispheres. During BSDs, the right-sided activation preceded the left-sided activation by 15 – 21 milliseconds in Patients 1 and 2. In Patients 3 and 4, the activation occurred 17 – 20 milliseconds earlier in the left than the right hemisphere. Within the same hemisphere, the sources of BSDs and UDs were located in similar areas. In conclusion, our results imply the cortical epileptogenicity in bilateral perirolandic areas in BREC. The sequential activation during BSDs in both hemispheres suggest the existence of synaptic connections, possibly via the corpus callosum, between bilateral irritative foci...|$|R

40|$|SummaryPurposeTo {{assess whether}} paired pulse {{magnetic}} motor evoked potential (MEP) can predict surgical {{prognosis in patients}} with intractable epilepsy. MethodsMEP of the unilateral hand muscles were recorded following paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex. The interstimulus intervals of paired stimulation were 1 – 16 ms with a conditioning stimulus that was 90 % active motor threshold. Subjects were six patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) scheduled for anterior temporal lobectomy and three patients with myoclonic or head-drop seizures scheduled for anterior corpus callosotomy, resulting in the unilateralization of epileptic discharges. The hemisphere showing <b>unilateral</b> <b>discharges</b> {{was defined as the}} affected hemisphere. The intracortical inhibition and facilitation curve was drawn based on MEP before and after surgery and the relationship between MEP and surgical prognosis was investigated. ResultsIn five patients with TLE showing class I surgical results (Engel's classification), the affected hemisphere showing cortical hyperexcitability preoperatively was almost normalized after surgery. However, in a patient with class III, the unaffected hemisphere showed cortical hyperexcitability before and after surgery. In the callosotomy group, two patients with excellent outcomes showed the same results as TLE group with class I.

His owners reported a left <b>unilateral</b> serous <b>discharge</b> beginning in June of 2008 that became mucopurulent in nature with occasional epistaxis. Past medical therapy included Clavamox and enrofloxacin, both with minimal effect. Skull radiographs, rhinoscopy, and fungal culture from a nasal swab were performed by the referring veterinarian. This information was forwarded along with Zak to Cornell for further investigation an evaluation. Physical examination revealed a left <b>unilateral</b> sanguinopurulent <b>discharge</b> from the nostril. Decreased airflow of the left nostril, depigmentation of the left nasal passage and rhinarium, pain on palpation of the muzzle, and occasional sneezing were noted. Hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, and clotting profile were within normal limits except for a mild hypoalbuminemia. Thoracic radiographs revealed no abnormalities. Review of the referring veterinarian's radiographs demonstrated increased soft tissue/fluid density in the left nasal cavity and frontal sinus.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo present {{long-term}} {{outcome and}} to identify predictors of seizure freedom after vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). MethodsAll patients who had undergone VNS implantation in the Epilepsy Centre Bethel were retrospectively reviewed. There were 144 patients who had undergone complete presurgical evaluation, including detailed clinical history, magnetic resonance imaging, and long-term video-EEG with ictal and interictal recordings. After implantation, all patients were examined at regular intervals of 4 weeks for 6 – 9 months. During this period the antiepileptic medication remained constant. All patients {{included in this study}} were followed up for a minimum of 2 years. ResultTen patients remained seizure-free for more than 1 year after VNS implantation (6. 9 %). Seizures improved in 89 patients (61. 8 %) but no changes were observed in 45 patients (31. 3 %). The following factors were significant in the univariate analysis: age at implantation, multifocal interictal epileptiform <b>discharges,</b> <b>unilateral</b> interictal epileptiform <b>discharge,</b> cortical dysgenesis, and psychomotor seizure. Stepwise multivariate analysis showed that <b>unilateral</b> interictal epileptiform <b>discharges</b> (IEDs), P= 0. 014, HR= 0. 112 (95 % CIs, 0. 019 – 0. 642), cortical dysgenesis P= 0. 007, HR= 0. 065 (95 % CIs, 0. 009 – 0. 481) and younger age at implantation P= 0. 026, HR= 7. 533 (95 % CIs 1. 28 – 44. 50) were independent predictors of seizure freedom in the long-term follow-up.

40|$|Objective: Sixteen {{different}} {{features are}} evaluated in their potential {{ability to detect}} seizures from scalp EEG recordings containing temporal lobe (TL) seizures. Features include spectral measures, non-linear methods (e. g. zero-crossings), phase synchronization and the recently introduced Brain Symmetry Index (BSI). Besides an individual comparison, several combinations of features are evaluated as well in their potential ability to detect TL seizures. - Methods: Sixteen long-term scalp EEG recordings, containing TL seizures from patients suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), were analyzed. For each EEG, all 16 features were determined for successive 10 s epochs of the recording. All epochs were labeled by experts for {{the presence or absence}} of seizure activity. In addition, triplet combinations of various features were evaluated using pattern recognition tools. Final performance was evaluated by the sensitivity and specificity (False Alarm Rate (FAR)), using ROC curves. - Results: In those TL seizures characterized by <b>unilateral</b> epileptiform <b>discharges,</b> the BSI was the best single feature. Except for one low-voltage EEG with many artifacts, the sensitivity found ranged from 0. 55 to 0. 90 at a FAR of 1 /h. Using three features increased the sensitivity to 0. 77 – 0. 97. In patients with bilateral electroencephalographic changes, the single best feature most often found was a measure for the number of minima and maxima (mmax) in the recording, yielding sensitivities of 0. 30 – 0. 96 at FAR 1 /h. Using three features increased the sensitivity to 0. 38 – 0. 99, at the same FAR. In various recordings, it was even possible to obtain sensitivities of 0. 70 – 0. 95 at a FAR= 0. - Conclusions: The Brain Symmetry Index is the most relevant individual feature to detect electroencephalographic seizure activity in TLE with <b>unilateral</b> epileptiform <b>discharges.</b> In patients with bilateral discharges, mmax performs best. Using a triplet of features significantly improves the performance of the detector. - Significance: Improved seizure detection can improve patient care in both the epilepsy monitoring unit and the intensive care unit...|$|R

40|$|Nipple {{discharge}} is {{a common}} presenting symptom of underlying breast pathology. This study examined the impact of galactography on the evaluation of abnormal nipple discharge. Thirty-five women with spontaneous, <b>unilateral</b> nipple <b>discharge</b> who underwent galactography from 1995 to 1997 were retrospectively studied. Their presenting signs as well as mammographic, galactographic, and pathology findings were evaluated. Nipple discharge was bloody (n = 24), clear (n = 7), or serous (n = 4). A palpable mass was found in 5 patients, and discharge was spontaneous in 29 patients (83 %). Mammography was normal in 25 patients (71 %). Thirty patients (86 %) had an abnormal ductogram that was characterized as a filling defect (n = 20), cutoff sign (n = 5), or ductal dilatation (n = 5). The ductogram demonstrated the location and depth of the lesion in 29 patients (97 %). Excision was performed in 27 of 30 patients with an abnormal ductogram: 14 received complete subareolar duct excisions; 12, focused excisions; and 1, excision with a vacuum-assisted biopsy device. Pathology included intraductal papilloma (n = 20) and ductal ectasia (n = 7). Follow-up was completed in 24 patients, including 2 postoperative patients who had persistent discharge on manipulation. In conclusion, galactography is accurate in identifying {{the location of the}} ductal abnormality. It allows a focused surgical approach to the pathologic lesion in these patients...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction The {{presence}} of a foreign body in the nose is a relatively uncommon occurrence. Many unusual foreign bodies in the nose {{have been reported in}} the literature, but no case of a nasal packing occurring as a foreign body in the nasal cavity for a prolonged time has been found. Case presentation We describe a unique case of the largest foreign body left in situ in the nasal cavity for over 10 years. Our patient was a 71 -year-old Caucasian man with diabetes. Because of this, he was at high risk of developing complications from the foreign body and the chronic sinusitis. Amazingly, though, the foreign body had not caused any symptoms on our patient for many years, except for nasal discharge during the last few years. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case in the literature of such a large intra-nasal foreign body described in an adult without mental illness and without trauma that remained in situ for such a long time. Conclusion Undoubtedly, even illnesses with no complications could prove difficult for clinicians to diagnose. Clinicians should recognize the underlying causes that are responsible for the symptoms of chronic sinusitis and a <b>unilateral</b> nasal <b>discharge</b> should be assumed to be caused by an intra-nasal foreign body until proven otherwise. </p...|$|R

Rhinoscopic examination identified a focal white mass in the mid-right nasal cavity. Histopathology of the mass diagnosed mycotic rhinitis. A pure growth of the fungus Scedosporium apiospermum was cultured from nasal tissue biopsies. Treatment consisted of a single bilateral nasal 1 % clotrimazole infusion, administered over one hour. Repeat rhinoscopy one month later demonstrated no recurrence of the fungus and there has been no recurrence to 12 months later. This is the first reported case of S. apiospermum isolated from the nasal cavity of a dog in Australia and should be considered as a differential for nasal discharge and a potential cause of fungal rhinitis in dogs...|$|R

After a series of tests that included rhinoscopy and fungal culture, nasal aspergillosis was diagnosed. Intranasal clotrimazole was applied twice and it allowed the resolution of the clinical signs...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Several {{pre-operative}} work-up protocols {{have been}} used while selecting epileptic patients for surgery among different centers. The relative value of the different available pre-operative tests is still under discussion. OBJECTIVE: We report on the surgical outcome obtained in patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy associated to mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) and who were evaluated pre-operatively by interictal EEG and MRI alone. METHOD: Forty one patients with refractory unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy were evaluated using interictal EEG and MRI. MRI disclosed unilateral MTS in all patients. All patients had at least 4 interictal EEG recordings. All patients were submitted to cortico-amygdalo-hippocampectomy at the side determined by MRI. RESULTS: Interictal EEG showed <b>unilateral</b> epileptiform <b>discharges</b> compatible with MRI findings in 37 patients; in four out of the 41 patients, bilateral discharges were found. Mean follow-up time was 4. 3 ± 1. 1 years. Thirty-nine patients (95. 1 %) were classified as Engels Class I (70. 6 % Engel I-A). Two patients (4. 9 %) were rated as Engel's Class II. All patients in whom bilateral discharges were found were in Engels Class I. Pathological examination showed MTS in all patients. CONCLUSION: It is possible to adequately select good surgical candidates for temporal lobe resection using MRI and interictal EEG alone. In patients with MRI-defined MTS we should expect a postoperative remission rate higher then 90 %. The finding of MTS on MRI {{is the most important}} good prognostic factor after temporal lobe resection...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{problems}} that may be seen in veterinary medicine is an animal with epistaxis. There are many diseases that can cause epistaxis, ranging from a space occupying lesion within the nasal cavity, to a systemic coagulopathy. However, the differential list can be narrowed and the inciting cause can be found by taking a thorough history, a good physical exam, and by using the appropriate diagnostic tools. "Marley" McKelvy was a 7 year old, male, intact white German Shepherd dog. He presented to the Cornell University Small Animal Emergency Service on 4 / 19 / 05 with the chief complaint of epistaxis and dyspnea. In early February of that year, Marley became inappetant and lethargic, and also began coughing and sneezing. He was brought to his referring veterinarian who took some thoracic radiographs, which were unremarkable. While he was there, a tracheal wash was performed and bacterial and fungal cultures were submitted. The cultures were all negative for bacteria and fungi. A few months later, on 4 / 16 / 05, Marley developed <b>unilateral</b> mucohemorrhagic <b>discharge</b> from his right nostril. The next day, a painful lump was found on {{the bridge of his nose}} between and slightly below his eyes. After that day, the nasal discharge became thicker and more hemorrhagic. Marley was prescribed Acepromazine to lower his blood pressure and to slow the amount of epistaxis, but no change in the discharge was seen. At this point, he was referred to Cornell for further assessment...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to assess the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with <b>unilateral</b> nipple <b>discharge.</b> Forty-four patients with bloody or serosanguineous nipple discharge and negative mammographic findings (35 / 44 cases) underwent MRI for evaluation of breast ducts. Ultrasonography, negative in 18 patients, identified 26 cases of ductal ectasia (12 simple, nine with solid intraductal echoes and wall thickening, five with inhomogeneous parenchyma). Galactography was negative in three patients and positive in nine. Nineteen patients were followed up by clinical examination, ultrasonography, and cytological evaluation of nipple discharge (6 - 12 months); three patients underwent excisional biopsy, ten core biopsy and 12 cytological biopsy (followed by excisional biopsy). MRI identified 25 enhancing lesions Breast Imaging Reporting and Data Systems (BI-RADS) 3 or 4) and confirmed the galactographic findings (ductal ectasia, intraluminal filling defects). Five papillomatoses appeared as patchy, homogeneous enhancing areas, 15 intraductal papillomas as areas with well-defined margins and type II time-intensity curves, and two atypical ductal hyperplasias as diffuse nodular enhancement. One micropapillary ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), one papillary carcinoma and one infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) were visualised as two segmental areas of enhancement and one mass-like enhancement with poorly defined margins (BI-RADS 4). The follow-up was negative, showing no pathological enhancement (BI-RADS 1) in 12 patients and benign enhancement (BI-RADS 2) in seven. Breast MRI {{can be considered a}} valuable examination in the diagnosis of suspected ductal disease and an alternative to galactography when the latter cannot be used...|$|R
