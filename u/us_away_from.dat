5|$|Although Christ, like man, {{is made in}} {{the image}} of God, he alone shares the {{likeness}} of God the Father. Christ is both sinless and apathetic, and thus by striving to imitate Christ, man can achieve salvation. To Clement, sin is involuntary, and thus irrational , removed only through the wisdom of the Logos. God's guidance of <b>us</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> sin is thus a manifestation of God's universal love for mankind. The word play on λόγος and αλόγον is characteristic of Clement's writing, and may be rooted in the Epicurean belief that relationships between words are deeply reflective of relationships between the objects they signify.|$|E

The current presenters would remain as hosts, but the series would focus on American cars and include American celebrities.

"Tarkovsky's works {{separate}} me completely {{from physical}} life, {{and are the}} most spiritual films I have seen — what Fellini did in parts of his movies, bringing dream life into film, he does as well.

500|$|For the film's director, King {{wanted someone}} [...] "who would steer <b>us</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the {{traditional}} BBC-type costume drama," [...] and [...] "make a period film for an MTV audience". By chance, someone recommended King watch the 2005 film C.R.A.Z.Y. by French-Canadian filmmaker Jean-Marc Vallée, and became immediately interested in hiring him. King offered {{the job to}} Vallée on their very first meeting. Though at first expressing disinterest, Vallée agreed to direct after reading the script. He commented, [...] "When I read the script, I saw it's a family drama, a romance, a political plot at the same time." [...] Vallee considered Victoria to be a rebel because [...] "she has this attitude, which is you make noise, you want to yell and yell loudly to your parents and all the people, to authority... 'I'm {{going to do it}} my way.' That's what rock 'n' roll is all about. That's what I liked about her, this energy. [...] was special and had this mystical quality." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1929, at {{the second}} UAHC convention, Witt had {{asserted}} that America [...] "by its very pleasantness and friendliness lures <b>us</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> our ancient loyalties. Its secularism is so delightful, its mutuality so penetrative, its universalism so delightful, that by a sort of sheer spiritual osmosis it incorporates us into itself and makes us look and {{become more and more}} like itself". Witt argued that Jews had to resist this pull. Ten years later, however, in a 1939 article in The Christian Century, he argued that Jews should celebrate Christmas. In his view, Christians were now more liberal and celebrated [...] "the inherent humanness and universalism" [...] of Christmas, rather than any specifically Christian doctrine. Stating that his children had been deprived of the holiday's pleasures, Witt asserted that Judaism was already a syncretic religion, and that celebrating the holiday was an ecumenical act which did not indicate that he was [...] "thereby drawn even by the breadth of a hair nearer to the worship of an ecclesiastical Christ". He concluded by asking [...] "Is it neither treason of Jew nor triumph of Christian but partnership of Jew and Christian in the making of a better world in which the Christ can have part only by energizing and perpetuating and hallowing the partnership?" ...|$|E
500|$|It's {{human nature}} to look to {{external}} forces when faced with our own inadequacies but the ethicist is against this. Comparison is an esthetic exercise and {{has nothing to do}} with ethics and religion. He says, [...] "Let each one learn what he can; both of us can learn that a person’s unhappiness never lies in his lack of control over external conditions, since this would only make him completely unhappy." [...] He also asks if a person [...] "absolutely in love can know if he is more or less in love than others." [...] He completes this thought later in his Concluding Unscientific Postscript and expands on looking inward in Practice in Christianity.The ethical and the ethical-religious have nothing to do with the comparative. … All comparison delays, and that is why mediocrity likes it so much and, if possible, traps everyone in it by its despicable friendship among mediocrities. A person who blames others, that they have corrupted him, is talking nonsense and only informs against himself. Concluding Unscientific Postscript p. 549-550Comparison is the most disastrous association that love can enter into; comparison is the most dangerous acquaintance love can make; comparison is the worst of all seductions. Søren Kierkegaard, Works of Love (1847), Hong, p. 186 Lord Jesus Christ, our foolish minds are weak; they are more than willing to be drawn-and there is so much that wants to draw us to itself. There is pleasure with its seductive power, the multiplicity with its bewildering distractions, the moment with its infatuating importance and the conceited laboriousness of busyness and the careless time-wasting of light-mindedness and the gloomy brooding of heavy-mindedness-all this will draw <b>us</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> ourselves to itself in order to deceive us. [...] But you, who are the truth, only you, Savior and Redeemer, can truly draw a person to yourself, which you have promised to do-that you will draw all to yourself. Then may God grant that by repenting we may come to ourselves, so that you, according to your Word, can draw us to yourself-from on high, but through lowliness and abasement.

2500|$|As at the Bangladesh shows, {{there was}} a poignancy to this 1972 performance, {{following}} the death of Allauddin Khan in September that year. As their music guru, Baba had remained a revered figure in their lives, and a man considered a saint in his home town of Maihar. In My Music, My Life, Shankar's 1968 autobiography, he writes admiringly of Baba [...] "follow {{a way of life that}} was a beautiful fusion of the best of both Hinduism and Islam", and being similarly broadminded in his musical vision by [...] " [...] <b>us</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the confines of narrow specialization that prevailed in our music".

2500|$|St. Jerome said, [...] "...we must {{set aside}} stated {{hours for the}} duty of praying. Then, should any {{occupation}} keep <b>us</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> it, the hour itself will remind us of that duty. As such prayer times everyone knows of the third, sixth and ninth hours, {{the morning and the}} evening hours." [...] It is from the fourth century onwards that we can gather a more precise Idea as to the composition of the hour of Terce. Most of John Cassian's Institutes III.3 is an exegetical justification for the offices of Terce, Sext, and None, in which he relates each hour to a scriptural passage in which an important event occurs at that hour. In this way, by directing the monks to scripture, the hours acquired an educational benefit. This was also the view held in Ireland, where the psalms selected for Terce focused on the glorification of the risen Christ.|$|E

This is the terrain into which Lee has ventured, and the resulting motion picture offers yet another effective and affecting portrait of the United States' most important and difficult conflict." [...] In consummate verbiage, David Sterritt writing for The Christian Science Monitor reasoned, [...] "The movie is longer and slower than necessary, but it explores interesting questions of wartime violence, personal integrity, {{and what it means to}} come of age in a society ripping apart at the seams." [...] Film critic Steve Simels of TV Guide was consumed with the nature of the subject matter exclaiming, [...] "A nicely ambiguous ending and terrific acting by the mostly young cast mostly makes up for the longeurs, however, and for the record, Jewel acquits herself well in a not particularly demanding role." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{document}} {{explains that}} eros and agape are both inherently good, but that eros risks being downgraded to mere sex {{if it is}} not balanced by an element of spiritual Christianity. The opinion that eros is inherently good follows a school of thought in the Catholic Church known as the [...] "Caritas tradition", and contrasts with the view expressed, for example, by Anders Nygren, a Lutheran bishop, in his mid-20th century book Eros and Agape, that agape is the only truly Christian kind of love, and that eros is an expression of the individual's desires and turns <b>us</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> God. These two positions have been an ongoing cause for debate in both Catholic and Protestant theology. The continuity of these two forms of love follows the traditional Catholic understanding, which is influenced by the philosophy of Plato, Augustine, Bonaventure and ancient Jewish tradition. The Nygren position was favoured by the Reformed theologian Karl Barth while the Caritas position was supported by the liberal Protestant theologian Paul Tillich.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{prepared}} about 18 {{songs for}} the album and {{teamed up with}} Swedish producers Mikael Nord Andersson an Martin Hansen. All the songs from the album are new written material, except four songs: [...] "Slave Me", [...] "No Limit", [...] "Turn You On" [...] and [...] "The Best Is Yet to Come" [...] which were written during the recording sessions for Unbreakable. During those sessions [...] "Turn You On" [...] had a different title; [...] "The Best Is Yet to Come" [...] was planned to be recorded for the album following Unbreakable, but when the band received an offer from Desmond Child to record [...] they kept the song and recorded it for this album. James Kottak in the interview for Sleaze Roxx explained: [...] "The first four songs that we wrote for this record were actually dark. I call them dark songs because they were probably too heavy compared to the stuff we've done in the past. They were in the vein of [...] "The Good Die Young", but you can't have too many songs like that. I love [...] "The Good Die Young" [...] but I'm glad the way things evolved took <b>us</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> where we were headed initially in the songwriting process. We also co-wrote with our producers, Martin Hansen and Mikael Andersson, who took the whole thing to an entirely different level".|$|E
