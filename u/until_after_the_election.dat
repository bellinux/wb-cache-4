5|$|A second {{conflict}} emerged {{just before}} the end of his term, when in 1945, the Labour government sought to abolish the country quota, a system that gave additional electoral seats in rural areas. Farming groups – predominantly National-supporting – strongly opposed the move, and argued that such a major change could only be made after gaining approval in a general election. Newall sympathised, and advised Fraser to wait <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> but did not feel it was appropriate to intervene; he assented to the bill.|$|E
5|$|When his {{re-election}} in 1975 seemed unsure, Kreisky proposed that his Social Democratic Party should form a coalition with the Freedom Party, headed by Friedrich Peter. Wiesenthal was {{in possession of}} information proving that Peter {{had been a member}} of the 1 SS Infantry Brigade, a unit that had exterminated over 13,000 Jewish civilians in Ukraine in 1941–42. He decided not to reveal this information to the press <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> but forwarded his dossier to President Rudolf Kirchschläger. Peter denied having participated in, or having knowledge of, any atrocities. In the end, Kreisky's party won a clear majority and did not form the coalition.|$|E
5|$|The LPF {{decided to}} {{maintain}} Fortuyn's candidacy, and delayed naming {{a new leader}} <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b> The 2002 general election proved a great success for the LPF, yielding 17% of the votes and 26 seats in the House of Representatives—by far {{a record number of}} seats in the Netherlands for a new party—to become the second largest party. LN also made it into Parliament, with two seats. The Labour Party (PvdA) and People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) saw their largest-ever losses, while the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) won large gains. CDA leader Jan Peter Balkenende had earlier announced that his party would follow a tougher line towards asylum seekers, and he later agreed with much of Fortuyn's criticism of the purple coalition and Holland's multicultural society. As leader of the strongest party, Balkenende became the leading candidate for Prime Minister.|$|E
50|$|The {{issue of}} {{limiting}} presidential powers was postponed <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> {{as part of}} the new constitution drafting process.|$|R
50|$|Opposition {{parties had}} accused both {{the federal and}} state governments of using public funds and {{publicly}} funded programs to support the PAN candidate. In response to this issue, the federal government decided to freeze all social programs on May 14, 2007, <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>elections.</b>|$|R
50|$|As of September 2014, {{incumbent}} mayor Barrow is {{in court}} facing conflict on interest complaint {{and may be}} removed from office if found guilty, but the ruling may not be made <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> in October. Perrelli is incumbent Ward 2 councillor running as mayor.|$|R
5|$|Elsewhere in the campaign, {{transport}} {{remained a}} major issue. David Cameron's deferral in December 2015 {{of a decision}} on plans for a third runway at Heathrow Airport <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> was interpreted {{as an attempt to}} avoid a clash with Goldsmith, his party's candidate, on the issue. Caroline Pidgeon and Siân Berry both promised changes to the fares system to reduce commuter costs on the Tube, while Khan and incumbent Conservative mayor Boris Johnson clashed over planned Tube strikes. An early January 2016 poll gave Khan a 10-point lead over Goldsmith, with bookmakers and pundits all favouring a Khan victory, though most agreed that the race was still open. Towards the end of January, provisional English Democrats candidate Winston McKenzie appeared on reality TV show Celebrity Big Brother, quickly being voted off and causing over 400 complaints to Ofcom following his negative comments about homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Even though Johnson {{had been}} given a mandate to take {{military}} action against North Vietnam and their Viet Cong allies in South Vietnam, he hesitated to take further steps to retaliate against North Vietnam. Towards the end of 1964, Johnson {{was in the midst of}} a presidential election and he did not want the U.S. public to believe that he was leading their country into war. Therefore, Johnson decided to wait <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> when his presidency was assured, that he would decide on other military moves. Meanwhile, the political situation in South Vietnam continued to worsen; in August 1964, South Vietnamese General Lan Van Phat tried to overthrow General Nguyễn Khánh, but the coup was aborted and Phat handed power to Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, and Generals Nguyễn Chánh Thi and Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. However, on 20 December 1964, Khánh formed a new military junta with Kỳ and Thi and the civilian-led High National Council was subsequently dissolved. Thus, the South Vietnamese Government was once again plunged into chaos.|$|E
25|$|During the 2008 presidential {{election}} campaign, Winfrey {{was criticized for}} apparently declining to invite Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin to her show <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b>|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, head of {{the rival}} GNA {{government}} which was based in Tripoli, Fayez al-Sarraj announced on 16 July 2017 that presidential and parliamentary elections would be held in March 2018. He {{also said that the}} GNA would remain as a caretaker government <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>elections.</b>|$|R
50|$|The slogan {{was then}} {{used as a}} central theme in the BJP's {{campaign}} for <b>the</b> 2004-05 national <b>elections,</b> a move criticised by the BJP's political opponents, who felt that public money was being used for partisan purposes. In response, <b>the</b> Indian <b>Election</b> Commission banned <b>the</b> slogan's broadcast <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>elections,</b> although BJP politicians continued to use the slogan in other contexts.|$|R

25|$|Nixon duly {{won in a}} landslide, {{carrying}} New York {{easily with}} the support of the vast majority of building and construction workers in that state, who four years earlier had voted overwhelmingly for Hubert Humphrey. In return for his support, Peter Brennan succeeded in having an audit of the New York Plan deferred <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b>|$|E
25|$|In his 2004 {{documentary}} Orwell Rolls in his Grave Robert Kane Pappas presents {{evidence that}} {{representatives from the}} Ronald Reagan campaign met with representatives from Iran {{to ensure that the}} hostages would not be released <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b> He concludes that after the congressional commission turned back any accusation of wrongdoing, the story and scandal were never reported further.|$|E
50|$|One {{question}} which was unresolved <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> was <b>the</b> threshold for {{passage of the}} amendments. The DPP and KMT had advocated a majority vote for passage, while the smaller parties advocated a three-fourths threshold. It wasn't <b>until</b> <b>the</b> week <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> that <b>the</b> Legislature agreed on the three-quarters voting threshold - when it was already clear that the parties which supported the amendments controlled more than 75% of the National Assembly. Also, the TSU has advocated voting on the amendments separately, which was impossible as the inter-party agreement for these amendments stipulated that they be adopted all or none.|$|R
5000|$|In 1940, 1942, and 2002, Congress {{continued}} meeting, {{sometimes in}} pro forma sessions every third day, <b>until</b> well <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b>|$|R

25|$|Toward {{the end of}} the campaign, Tory Leader Kathy Dunderdale {{was confronted}} by {{frustrated}} fisheries workers in Marystown in the district of Burin-Placentia West held by Minister of Fisheries & Aquaculture Clyde Jackman. Dunderdale, accompanied by Jackman and Grand Bank district MHA Darin King, refused to negotiate with the workers <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b> Jackman {{went on to win the}} election by only 40 votes.|$|E
25|$|In April 1970, {{a general}} {{election}} was held with the Rhodesian Front easily winning. Ian Smith portrayed his government as not being racialist, and sought to postpone {{the question of what}} to do about the problems in the farming industry <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b> Indeed, he was able to do so because more radical and more racist parties had at that time been formed and stood in the election.|$|E
25|$|Patarkatsishvili's {{opposition}} {{television station}} Imedi {{was shut down}} in November 2007 after the authorities accused it of complicity with the plot to overthrow the elected government. The channel resumed broadcasts {{a few weeks after}} the incident, but did not cover news or talk shows <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b> Subsequently, the station was sold to supporters of the Saakashvili government and some Georgian journalists have called for the station to be handed back.|$|E
50|$|The {{government}} resigned on 16 April - only a {{month before}} polling day - <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands Institute for War Documentation published the Srebrenica: a 'safe' area report, criticizing the Dutch government's handling {{of the events that}} led to the Srebenica massacre in 1995. However, the ministers remained in office as a caretaker government <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> and <b>the</b> formation of the next government, and the date of <b>the</b> <b>election</b> was not changed.|$|R

5000|$|Although not confirmed, {{the deal}} was rumoured to be {{conditional}} on the People's Party winning regional elections on 27 May 2007. However, Ecclestone had clarified his comments on May 16, 2007: [...] "I said I wouldn't formalise a contract <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> because I didn't know who I would be signing it with." [...] He said his statements were taken out of context. [...] Ecclestone has since been cleared of influencing <b>the</b> <b>election</b> by <b>the</b> Valencian Electoral Commission.|$|R
25|$|Under federal {{election}} laws, Carter and Reagan received $29.4 million each, and Anderson {{was given a}} limit of $18.5 million with private fund-raising allowed for him only. They {{were not allowed to}} spend any other money. Carter and Reagan each spent about $15 million on television advertising, and Anderson under $2 million. Reagan ended up spending $29.2 million in total, Carter $29.4 million, and Anderson spent $17.6 million—partially because he (Anderson) didn't get Federal Election Commission money <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b>|$|E
25|$|DI McCone had {{statutory}} {{control over}} all intelligence committees, but in reality, {{but the military}} had near total control of the DIA, the NRO, the NSA, and many other aspects. Importantly, President Johnson almost completely ignored the CIA. In effect, the military controlled the two thirrds of the CIA budget laid out for covert action. McCone, the unspoken hero of the Cuban Missile Crisis, submitted his resignation in the summer, but Johnson would not accept it <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 2009 presidential {{election}} {{was the first}} in which voters could only use their Abkhazian passport to identify themselves. This disenfranchised mostly the Georgian part of Abkhazian society, since the majority of Georgians does not have Abkhazian citizenship. In the run-up to the election, President Bagapsh attempted to extend the number of Georgians eligible for Abkhazian citizenship, but had to abandon these plans under opposition protests, and the government decided to suspend <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> the issuing of new passports to residents of the Gali District, where most Georgians live.|$|E

25|$|After Tzipi Livni won <b>the</b> {{leadership}} <b>election,</b> Olmert officially resigned {{but remained}} prime minister, {{according to the}} dictates of <b>the</b> law. Even <b>after</b> an official resignation, he remains in power until a new prime minister is sworn in, in order to prevent a government void. Livni tried unsuccessfully to form a new coalition government. After Livni announced she could not form the new government, new parliamentary elections were set for 10 February 2009, and Olmert remained in power <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>elections,</b> just as <b>the</b> law dictates.|$|R
50|$|In {{all four}} electorates, the {{nomination}} meeting {{was held on}} Wednesday, 15 April 1868. Political parties would not form <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> 1890 <b>elections,</b> so all members were Independents.|$|R
25|$|The {{second round}} was rerun on 28 December 2008 {{but due to}} {{logistics}} problems, the Tain District alone had its run-off election on 2 January 2009 due to problems with distributing ballots. Following the voting on 28 December, Mills led by a slim margin, causing the Election Commission to state it would not announce Mills as the winner <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> rerun in Tain. Prior to the announcement hundreds of NDC supporters converged on the election headquarters demanding that Mills be declared the victor, but were kept at bay by riot police and armed soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Jarka Sipka, Rudolf Kleppich, Murray Chapman and Sarah Walters {{were four}} people from New South Wales who were {{entitled}} to vote in New South Wales elections, but had not enrolled to vote in federal elections. When they applied {{to be put on}} the electoral roll, the Registrar refused to put their names on the roll <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> because the roll was already closed. Sipka and Chapman could have enrolled before the writs were issued, had they so chosen, but Kleppich and Walters could only have enrolled on or after 15 February, because Kleppich was not naturalised until that date, and Walters did not turn eighteen (the minimum voting age) until that date.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, {{the inaugural}} National Assembly of South Korea {{nominated}} Kim {{as a candidate}} for the office of the first president of the Republic. In the election by the National Assembly, Kim was defeated by Rhee Syngman (이승만; 李承晩), the first president of the provisional government, who had been impeached in 1925 by a vote of 180-16. He lost the election for the vice presidency to Lee Si-yeong (이시영; 李始榮) by a vote of 133-59. Kim did not know about his nomination <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b> He did not approve the nomination, considering it a ploy to discredit him. Kim would never have participated in the election as he fiercely opposed the establishment of separate governments in North and South Korea.|$|E
25|$|On 20 November 2007, Musharraf went to Saudi Arabia as he {{left the}} country {{for the first time since}} {{implementing}} emergency rule. He attempted to convince Saudi Arabia to prevent Sharif from returning <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> in January 2008. The political role of Sharif returned to <b>the</b> fore <b>after</b> Benazir Bhutto's return a month earlier. Saudi Arabia appeared to argue that if Pakistan has allowed a democratic-socialist woman leader, Benazir Bhutto, to return to the country, then the conservative Sharif should be permitted to return too.|$|R
50|$|During Stoltenberg's First Cabinet, Lier-Hansen was {{appointed}} State Secretary in the Ministry of the Environment. He held <b>the</b> position <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> 2001 <b>elections,</b> which caused <b>the</b> cabinet to fall.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{factor was}} that Tymiński's use of political-marketing methods unknown in Poland at the time. A {{key element of}} his {{campaign}} was an omnipresent black briefcase, allegedly containing [...] "secret documents" [...] which would destroy his rivals' careers when the time was right. Although <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> passed without <b>the</b> briefcase being opened, its presence attracted constant attention. Tymiński's adversaries adopted a similar strategy; the daily Gazeta Wyborcza (which supported Mazowiecki) reported that Tymiński had had contact with the secret police, a story that was not withdrawn <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>elections.</b>|$|R
