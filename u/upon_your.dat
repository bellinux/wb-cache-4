25|$|When {{different}} {{materials are}} brought {{together and then}} separated, an accumulation of electric charge can occur which leaves one material positively charged while the other becomes negatively charged. The mild shock that you receive when touching a grounded object after walking on carpet {{is an example of}} excess electrical charge accumulating in your body from frictional charging between your shoes and the carpet. The resulting charge build-up <b>upon</b> <b>your</b> body can generate a strong electrical discharge. Although experimenting with static electricity may be fun, similar sparks create severe hazards in those industries dealing with flammable substances, where a small electrical spark may ignite explosive mixtures with devastating consequences.|$|E

25|$|The subject {{upon which}} you have written to me {{is one in which}} I {{naturally}} take a more than common interest. Not only was I one of the Oxford Crew in the first Inter-University Boat-Race in 1829, but the Race was entirely set up by me, owing to the fact that though I was myself at Christ Church, Oxford, my home was at Cambridge (my father being Master of Trinity), and I had a large acquaintance there, and some-times (especially in Easter vacations) was invited to pull in one of their boats, e. g. that of St John's, in which were the now Bishops, Selwyn and Tyrrell, and Charles Merivale the historian, all now vigorous and flourishing. I may also mention, as bearing <b>upon</b> <b>your</b> enquiry, that as soon as my father heard that I had been chosen one of the Oxford Eight, and was practising for the Race, he wrote me an earnest letter, in which he desired me not to row any more, simply from anxiety lest my health should suffer. Though I was always much given to athletic exercises, even before I went to Harrow (where I was one of the Eleven in the first Matches against Eton, for four years, 1822 – 1825), my constitution was in some respects rather a delicate one. When I received his letter I went at once to my physician, told him the difficulty in which I was placed, begged him to examine my state of health, and got his authority to assure my father that so far as he could judge, rowing had not done me any harm. By this my father was satisfied, and I was allowed to go on. The Race itself, which was at Henley (two miles up stream), certainly did me no harm, though at the time I was incommoded by the change to an unusual diet, — under-done beefsteaks, porter, dry bread, no butter, no tea, no vegetables. After the Race, which was on Wednesday or Tuesday (I think), I was able to play cricket, as one of the Eleven also, against Cambridge on the following Friday. The match was at Oxford. We were victorious on both occasions.|$|E

500|$|... "May God {{have mercy}} <b>upon</b> <b>your</b> soul" [...] or [...] "may God {{have mercy on}} your soul" [...] is a phrase used within courts in various legal systems by judges pronouncing a {{sentence}} of death upon a person found guilty of a crime that requires a death sentence. The phrase originated in beth din courts in the Kingdom of Israel {{as a way to}} attribute God as the highest authority in law. The usage of the phrase later spread to England and Wales' legal system and from there to usage throughout the colonies of the British Empire whenever a death sentence was passed.|$|E

It was also written in Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. The phrase [...] "may God have mercy on your soul" [...] was also used in the 1995 film, Billy Madison as part of an insult. In the classic The Green Mile, guards Paul Edgecomb, Brutus Howell and Percy Wetmore use this phrase before they conduct an execution.|$|E
500|$|It is {{doubtful}} {{whether it was}} possible for Speyer to resign from the Privy Council or as a baronet, there being no normal mechanism to do so, but the Prime Minister's response was supportive: [...] "I have known you long, and well enough to estimate at their true value these baseless and malignant imputations <b>upon</b> <b>your</b> loyalty to the British Crown.

500|$|Music {{magazine}} Rolling Stone gave Diorama {{four and}} a half stars in Australia and three out of five stars in the US. Reviewer Mark Kemp praised Silverchair's development, saying that the band had developed a strong, independent musical ability, in contrast to their heavily influenced debut album, Frogstomp. Kemp spoke highly of the [...] "heavy orchestration, unpredictable melodic shifts and a whimsical pop sensibility", also noting Parks' arrangements gave the music [...] "more breadth and depth". He argued that the album's strength was a product of Johns' confidence, resulting in high quality on [...] "World <b>Upon</b> <b>Your</b> Shoulders", [...] "Tuna in the Brine", and [...] "After All These Years". However, [...] "Without You" [...] saw Silverchair slip into [...] "old habits", according to Kemp, and contained an [...] "MTV-approved hook".|$|E
500|$|Critics were {{positive}} towards the song.

[...] Adrien Begrand of PopMatters wrote: [...] "Buckland's lead fills highlight the wondrous 'God Put a Smile on Your Face', as the song's chorus reaches heights that rival those of their fellow countrymen Doves." [...] Ted Kessler of NME wrote: [...] "Over a pounding garage tattoo Martin poses a deep, mortality-based teaser ('where {{do we go from}} here?'), asserts some self-belief ('God gave me style, God gave me grace') and then hits upon the bottom line as the song's mood suddenly improves with another fat and glorious chorus: 'Yeah, when you work it out I'm the same as you....your guess is as good as mine.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{phrase is}} used by the {{presiding}} judge pronouncing the sentence of death after putting on a black cap and black gloves. In England, the black gloves were a deliberate contrast with the white gloves normally worn {{at the end of an}} Assize sitting, which indicated there had been no death sentence passed during the Assize. The wording of the traditional phrase has changed over time. In England, the wording in the 18th century was [...] "and the Lord have mercy upon thy soul". This later developed into [...] "may God have mercy <b>upon</b> <b>your</b> soul", which was used as the traditional closing sentence by judges passing the death sentence in England and Wales, Canada and Australia. The phrase is treated as a prayer and would traditionally be followed by [...] "amen". [...] Newspaper reports would cite the usage of the phrase as [...] "the usual words had been said".|$|E
