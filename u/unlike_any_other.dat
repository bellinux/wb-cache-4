5|$|In Uruguay, {{the album}} was {{released}} in 1974 as a single LP (with just the first two sides) on Odeon Records. It used a simplistic sleeve design <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> release, with a rising sun on the cover.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>any</b> <b>other,</b> the Belgian folk metal band Ithilien {{preferred}} {{to focus their}} lyrics on very personal subjects such as loss, perseverance or grief. The album Shaping the Soul is for example constructed based on Elisabeth Kubler-Ross model of the mourning process.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> {{species of}} Siricidae, the Sirex {{woodwasp}} can damage relatively healthy trees so heavily, they die back. However, the wasp mainly infests weakened trees; {{only when the}} population is high does the insect also attack intact and healthy trees. Because the wasp larvae and the fungus need healthy wood, the Sirex woodwasp does not infest dry or dead timber. However, wasps may hatch from processed wood which was already infested.|$|E

60|$|The {{reader will}} now {{see that there}} is but little {{difficulty}} in identifying Byzantine work, the archivolt mouldings being so similar among themselves, and so <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> <b>others.</b> We have next to examine the Gothic forms.|$|R
50|$|The Mansions {{are also}} an {{excellent}} example of the work of George Henry Male Addison, a designer who made an important contribution to Queensland's built environment. Stylistically these highly finished and ornate terrace houses are <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> <b>others</b> in Queensland but are characteristic of Addison's work as an accomplished designer achieving maximum effect with roof form and face brickwork relieved with stone detailing.|$|R
5|$|Whitwell Station, on the Ventnor West {{branch of}} the Isle of Wight Central Railway, was opened {{along with the other}} {{stations}} on the branch on 20 July 1897. It was equipped with a passing loop, two platforms, a signal box and a substantial station building. Located at the top of Nettlecombe Lane, the station is located close to the village and the community it was intended to serve, <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> stations on the line.|$|E
5|$|Dwarf lemurs are {{the only}} {{primates}} known to hibernate for extended periods. Unlike other hibernating mammals from temperate regions, which have to awaken regularly for a few days, dwarf lemurs experience five months of continuous deep hibernation (May through September). Before and after this deep hibernation, there are two months (April and October) of transition, where they will forage on a limited basis to reduce demands on their fat reserves. <b>Unlike</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> hibernating mammal, the body temperature of hibernating dwarf lemurs will fluctuate with the ambient temperature rather than remaining low and stable.|$|E
5|$|The Dwarfie Stane tomb on {{the island}} of Hoy is made from a single huge block of red {{sandstone}} with a hollowed-out central chamber. This style is quite <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> Neolithic Orkney site and probably dates from about 2500 BC. It was the first Orcadian ancient monument to be described in writing, appearing in the 16th century Descriptio Insularum Orchadiarum by Joannem Ben who provided the explanation for its existence as having been built and used by giants.|$|E

50|$|Paintings {{from the}} Yuan Dynasty were <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> <b>others</b> {{produced}} in previous eras in China. Due to the Mongol seizure of the Song Dynasty and the difficult economic state, {{the existence of}} many professional art schools and painters in China began to decline. Now, fewer artists were working for the imperial courts or other wealthy sponsors. This led {{to the rise of}} the preexisting class of scholar-amateur painters, like Gong Kai.|$|R
25|$|Germany {{produces}} wines in many styles: dry, semi-sweet {{and sweet}} white wines, rosé wines, red wines and sparkling wines, called Sekt. (The only wine style not commonly produced is fortified wine.) Due to the northerly {{location of the}} German vineyards, the country has produced wines quite <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> <b>others</b> in Europe, many of outstanding quality. Between the 1950s and the 1980s German wine was known abroad for cheap, sweet or semi-sweet, low-quality mass-produced wines such as Liebfraumilch.|$|R
5|$|Due to its {{isolated}} coastal location, the Isle of Portland has {{an extensive}} range of flora and fauna; the coastline and disused quarries are designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Sea and migratory birds occupy the cliffs in different seasons, sometimes these include rare species which draw ornithologists {{from around the}} country. Rare visitors to the surrounding seas include dolphins, seals and basking sharks. Chesil Beach {{is one of only}} two sites in Britain where the scaly cricket can be found; <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> cricket it is wingless and does not sing or hop. Ten British Primitive goats were introduced to the East Weares part of the island to control scrub in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Resident {{killer whales}} {{in the eastern}} North Pacific have a {{particularly}} complex and stable social grouping system. <b>Unlike</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> mammal species whose social structure is known, residents live with their mothers for their entire lives. These family groups are based on matrilines consisting of the eldest female (matriarch) and her sons and daughters, and the descendants of her daughters, etc. The average size of a matriline is 5.5 animals. Because females can reach age 90, {{as many as four}} generations travel together. These matrilineal groups are highly stable. Individuals separate for only a few hours at a time, to mate or forage. With one exception, the killer whale named Luna, no permanent separation of an individual from a resident matriline has been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his career}} von Stroheim used {{grotesque}} imagery and characters. This is most {{apparent in the}} wedding-banquet scene, which includes a midget, a hunchback, a woman with buck teeth and a boy on crutches. The wedding guests violently and crudely devour their meal like animals. This scene was <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> in films of that period, which treated meals with dignity {{and a sense of}} communion. Other instances of grotesque imagery include Trina's fingers becoming infected and amputated. Von Stroheim contrasted love scenes between McTeague and Trina with their ugly, lower-class environment, such as the sewer with the dead rat and a garbage truck driving by as they kiss.|$|E
50|$|The Native American Chumash and Tongva {{people living}} in the area built boats <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> <b>others</b> in North America prior to contact by settlers. Pulling fallen Northern California redwood trunks and pieces of {{driftwood}} from the Santa Barbara Channel, their ancestors learned to seal the cracks between the boards of the large wooden plank canoes by using the natural resource of tar. This innovative form of transportation allowed access up and down the coastline and to the Channel Islands.|$|R
25|$|Wald's {{vision for}} Henry Street was one <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> <b>others</b> at the time. Wald {{believed}} that every New York City resident {{was entitled to}} equal and fair health care regardless of their social status, socio-economic status, race, gender, or age. She argued that everyone {{should have access to}} at-home-care. A strong advocate for adequate bed-side manner, Wald believed that regardless of if a person could afford at-home-care, they deserved to be treated with the same level of respect that some who could afford it would be.|$|R
50|$|Cryosophila is {{distinguished}} from related genera by its long, branched spines which {{are derived from}} modified roots. These downward-pointing spines cover the trunk, often quite densely. The genus {{is one of the}} few palms which use modified roots as spines, and its spines are <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> <b>others</b> in morphology or appearance. The density of spines varies from less than 25 over a 10 cm length of stem in some species to others where the entire stem is covered by a dense mass of spines.|$|R
5|$|In another {{patrol in}} July, U-14 sailed {{on the north}} side of the island of Corfu while headed for Santi Quaranta, Albania. Because the harbor at Corfu was {{occupied}} by the French fleet at the time, U-14 conducted a ruse de guerre by flying the submarine's former national flag, the French tricolor, in order to pass unmolested. Even though U-14s new conning tower made her look <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> Brumaire-class boat, one French patrol plane was successfully fooled by the ruse. When U-14s crew first spotted the aircraft, flying towards them from the direction of the sun, there was not enough time to submerge. As the aircraft drew near, its French markings—and its cargo of bombs—became apparent to the crew. With no other course of action possible, U-14s crew waved their hats and handkerchiefs at the plane. As the French pilot passed overhead, he returned the waves, apparently unaware of the U-boat's true nationality. The only success by U-14 on this cruise was the sinking of Marionga Goulandris, a Greek steamer, near Cape Matapan.|$|E
5|$|In their {{original}} description, Charig and Milner found Baryonyx unique {{enough to warrant}} a new family of theropod dinosaurs: Baryonychidae. They found Baryonyx to be <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> theropod group (and considered {{the possibility that it}} was a thecodont, due to apparently primitive features), but noted that the articulation of the maxilla and premaxilla was similar to that in Dilophosaurus. They also noted that two fragmentary snouts from Niger, assigned to the family Spinosauridae by French palaeontologist Philippe Taquet in 1984, appeared almost identical to those of Baryonyx and they referred them to Baryonychidae instead. In 1988, American palaeontologist Gregory S. Paul agreed with Taquet that Spinosaurus, described in 1915 based on fragmentary remains from Egypt which were destroyed in World War II, and Baryonyx were similar and (due to their kinked snouts) possibly late-surviving dilophosaurs. French palaeontologist Eric Buffetaut also supported this relationship in 1989. In 1990 Charig and Milner dismissed the spinosaurid affinities of Baryonyx, since they did not find their remains similar enough.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> element, helium {{will remain}} liquid down to {{absolute}} zero at normal pressures. This {{is a direct}} effect of quantum mechanics: specifically, the zero point energy {{of the system is}} too high to allow freezing. Solid helium requires a temperature of 1–1.5K (about −272°C or −457°F) at about 25 bar (2.5MPa) of pressure. It is often hard to distinguish solid from liquid helium since the refractive index of the two phases are nearly the same. The solid has a sharp melting point and has a crystalline structure, but it is highly compressible; applying pressure in a laboratory can decrease its volume by more than 30%. With a bulk modulus of about 27 MPa it is ~100 times more compressible than water. Solid helium has a density of 0.214±0.006g/cm3 at 1.15K and 66atm; the projected density at 0K and 25 bar (2.5 MPa) is 0.187±0.009g/cm3. At higher temperatures, helium will solidify with sufficient pressure. At room temperature, this requires about 114,000 atm.|$|E
5000|$|Within the Victorian Railways {{there were}} some wagons which stayed within {{workshop}} compounds, and so were never taken out onto the mainline. Usually these wagons were conversions from [...] "scrapped" [...] wagons, {{and for the most}} part were un-numbered. There was one wagon which was <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> <b>others,</b> recorded as the [...] "Workshops Oil Transfer" [...] wagon. It seems to have been in regular 'mainline' use between Ballarat and Newport. By 1975 it was stored at the latter, and it may still be there today.|$|R

40|$|We {{outline the}} problem of ad hoc rules in treebanks, rules used for {{specific}} constructions in one data set and unlikely to be used again. These include ungeneralizable rules, erroneous rules, rules for ungrammatical text, and rules which are {{not consistent with the}} rest of the annotation scheme. Based on a simple notion of rule equivalence and on the idea of finding rules <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> <b>others,</b> we develop two methods for detecting ad hoc rules in flat treebanks and show they are successful in detecting such rules. This is done by examining evidence across the grammar and without making any reference to context. ...|$|R

25|$|Despite the {{volley of}} {{sharp-edged}} comments that it ensued, Maine Maandu Nahin Dekha {{is a work}} <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> published in recent times.

40|$|We {{study the}} output costs of 40 {{systemic}} banking crises since 1980. Most, but not all, crises {{in our sample}} coincide with a sharp contraction in output from which it took several years to recover. Our main findings are as follows. First, the current financial crisis is <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> <b>others</b> {{in terms of a}} wide range of economic factors. Second, the output losses of past banking crises were higher when they were accompanied by a currency crisis or when growth was low at the onset of the crisis. When accompanied by a sovereign debt default, a systemic banking crisis was less costly. And, third, there is a tendency for systemic banking crises to have lasting negative output effects. ...|$|R
