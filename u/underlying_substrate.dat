25|$|Thermally, a {{temperate}} glacier is at {{melting point}} throughout the year, from its surface to its base. The ice of a polar glacier is always below the freezing point {{from the surface}} to its base, although the surface snowpack may experience seasonal melting. A sub-polar glacier includes both temperate and polar ice, depending on depth beneath the surface and position {{along the length of}} the glacier. In a similar way, the thermal regime of a glacier is often described by its basal temperature. A cold-based glacier is below freezing at the ice-ground interface, and is thus frozen to the <b>underlying</b> <b>substrate.</b> A warm-based glacier is above or at freezing at the interface, and is able to slide at this contact. This contrast is thought to a large extent to govern the ability of a glacier to effectively erode its bed, as sliding ice promotes plucking at rock from the surface below. Glaciers which are partly cold-based and partly warm-based are known as polythermal.|$|E

Surprisingly, we found that cyclic loading of the same stress amplitude can induce cell spreading in mouse embryonic stem cells but not in ∼ 10 times stiffer differentiated cells.

This work characterizes the time-resolved release of mercury vapor from broken CFLs and from <b>underlying</b> <b>substrates</b> after removal of glass fragments to simulate cleanup. In new lamps, mercury vapor is released gradually in amounts that reach 1. 3 mg or 30 % of the total lamp inventory after four days. Similar time profiles but smaller amounts are released from spent lamps or from <b>underlying</b> <b>substrates.</b> Nanoscale formulations of S, Se, Cu, Ni, Zn, Ag, and WS 2 are evaluated for capture of Hg vapor under these conditions and compared to conventional microscale formulations. Adsorption capacities range over 7 orders of magnitude, from 0. 005 (Zn micropowder) to 188 [*] 000 μg/g (unstabilized nano-Se), depending on sorbent chemistry and particle size. Nanosynthesis offers clear advantages for most sorbent chemistries.

Therefore, it is important for biomaterials to be able to orchestrate the biochemical and biophysical cues to facilitate cell–cell and cell–ECM interactions to facilitate stem cell therapy.|$|R
