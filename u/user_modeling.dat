40|$|The use of <b>user</b> <b>models</b> {{can be very}} {{valuable}} when trying to develop accessible and ergonomic products and services taking into account users specific needs and preferences. Simulation of userproduct interaction using <b>user</b> <b>models</b> may reveal accessibility issues at {{the early stages of}} design and development, and this results to a significant reduction in costs and development time. Moreover, <b>user</b> <b>models</b> can be used in adaptive interfaces enabling the personalised customisation of user interfaces that enhances the accessibility and usability of products and services. This paper presents the efforts of the Virtual <b>User</b> <b>Modelling</b> and Simulation Standardisation VUMS cluster of projects towards the development of an interoperable <b>user</b> <b>model,</b> able to describe both able-bodied and people with various kinds of disabilities. The VUMS cluster is consisted by the VERITAS, MyUI, GUIDE, and VICON FP 7 European projects, all involved in <b>user</b> <b>modelling</b> from different perspectives. The main goal of the VUMS cluster was the development of a unified <b>user</b> <b>model</b> that could be used by all the participant projects and that could be the basis of a new <b>user</b> <b>model</b> standard. Currently, within the VUMS cluster, a common <b>user</b> <b>model</b> has been defined and converters that enable the transformation from each projects specific <b>user</b> <b>model</b> to the VUMS <b>user</b> <b>model</b> and vice versa have been developed enabling, thus, the exchange of <b>user</b> <b>models</b> between the projects...|$|R

The {{combination}} of low and falling costs of storage, combined with increasingly pervasive and ubiquitous computing are creating {{the possibility of}} very long term <b>user</b> <b>modelling.</b> This paper explores some of the fundamental questions {{about the nature of}} a lifelong <b>user</b> <b>model.</b> It begins by exploring the relationship between the new goals that lifelong <b>user</b> <b>models</b> can support and the concomitant issues and challenges. We then explore the nature of what belongs in the <b>user</b> <b>model,</b> and what does not. From these foundations of the goals that the lifelong <b>user</b> <b>model</b> must serve, we discuss drivers for the design of systems which implement lifelong <b>user</b> <b>models.</b> We conclude with discussion of broad issues that follow from our analysis, proposing a roadmap for research needed to achieve lifelong <b>user</b> <b>models.</b> ...|$|R

These ensure that the individual’s applications can access their model whenever it is needed. At the same time, the user can control {{the use of their}} <b>user</b> <b>model.</b> So, they can ensure it is accessed only when and where they wish, by applications that they wish. We consider the challenges of representing <b>user</b> <b>models</b> {{so that they can be}} reused by multiple applications. We indicate potential synergies between distributed and centralised <b>user</b> <b>modelling</b> architectures, proposing {{an architecture}} which combines both.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{a variety of}} <b>user</b> <b>models</b> have been {{proposed}} for user simulation-based reinforcement-learning of dialogue strategies. However, the strategies learned with these models are rarely evaluated in actual user trials and it remains unclear how the choice of <b>user</b> <b>model</b> affects {{the quality of the}} learned strategy. In particular, the degree to which strategies learned with a <b>user</b> <b>model</b> generalise to real user populations has not be investigated. This paper presents a series of experiments that qualitatively and quantitatively examine the effect of the <b>user</b> <b>model</b> on the learned strategy. Our results show that the performance and characteristics of the strategy are in fact highly dependent on the <b>user</b> <b>model.</b> Furthermore, a policy trained with a poor <b>user</b> <b>model</b> may appear to perform well when tested with the same model, but fail when tested with a more sophisticated <b>user</b> <b>model.</b> This raises significant doubts about the current practice of learning and evaluating strategies with the same <b>user</b> <b>model.</b> The paper further investigates a new technique for testing and comparing strategies directly on real human-machine dialogues, thereby avoiding any evaluation bias introduced by the <b>user</b> <b>model.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|<b>User</b> <b>modelling</b> {{systems to}} date have relied heavily on <b>user</b> <b>models</b> that were hand crafted {{for use in a}} {{particular}} situation. Recently, attention has focused on the feasibility of general <b>user</b> <b>models,</b> models that can be transferred from one situation to another with little or no modification. Such a general <b>user</b> <b>model</b> could be implemented as a modular component easily integrated into diverse systems. This paper addresses one class of general <b>user</b> <b>models,</b> those general with respect to the underlying domain of the application. In particular, a domain independent <b>user</b> <b>modelling</b> module for cooperative advisory systems is discussed. A major problem in building <b>user</b> <b>models</b> is the difficulty of acquiring information about the user. Traditional approaches have relied heavily on information that is pre-encoded by the system designer. For a <b>user</b> <b>model</b> to be domain independent, acquisition of knowledge will have to be done implicitly, i. e., knowledge about the user must be acquired during his interaction with the system. The research proposed in this paper focuses on domain independent implicit <b>user</b> <b>model</b> acquisition techniques for cooperative advisory systems. These techniques have been formalized as a set of model acquisition rules that will {{serve as the basis for}} the implementation of the model acquisition portion of a general <b>user</b> <b>modelling</b> module.

In many situations, it {{is common}} that a large single source of data serves as input to {{multiple}} application areas, each of which may use a different <b>user</b> <b>model.</b> It {{is often the case}} that each <b>user</b> <b>model</b> is assembled using a different process, however, in general, it is more efficient to have a single architecture for building different <b>user</b> <b>models</b> for different application areas. We propose an architecture based on MapReduce that allows for processing terabytes of information in a timely fashion using pluggable components, each one capable of including different features in the final <b>user</b> <b>model.</b> A metamodel is used for specifying the characteristics of the desired <b>user</b> <b>model,</b> which can include a short-term <b>user</b> <b>model</b> and a long-term <b>user</b> <b>model,</b> and the architecture is responsible for building it from the specified data and pluggable components. We present an instantiation of the architecture for telecommunication (telco) applications and evaluate how the architecture escalates with a real dataset.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the ways light-weight ontologies can support scrutability for large <b>user</b> <b>models</b> and the <b>user</b> <b>modelling</b> process. It explores the role that light-weight ontologies can play, and how they can be exploited, for the purpose of creating and maintaining large, scrutable <b>user</b> <b>models</b> consisting of hundreds of components. We address problems in four key areas: ontology creation, metadata annotation, creation and maintenance of large <b>user</b> <b>models,</b> and <b>user</b> <b>model</b> visualisation, with a goal to provide a simple and adaptable approach that maintains scrutability. Each of these key areas presents a number of challenges that we address. Our solution is the development of a toolkit, LOSUM, which consists of a number of tools to support the <b>user</b> <b>modelling</b> process. It incorporates light-weight ontologies to fulfill a number of roles: aiding in metadata creation, providing structure for large <b>user</b> <b>model</b> visualisation, and as a means to reason across granularities in the <b>user</b> <b>model.</b> In conjunction with this, LOSUM also features a novel visualisation tool, SIV, which performs a dual role of ontology and <b>user</b> <b>model</b> visualisation, supporting the process of ontology creation, metadata annotation, and <b>user</b> <b>model</b> visualisation. We evaluated our approach at each stage with small user studies, and conducted a large scale integrative evaluation of these approaches together in an authentic learning context with 114 students, of whom 77 had exposure to their learner models through SIV. The results showed that students could use the interface and understand the process of <b>user</b> <b>model</b> construction.
