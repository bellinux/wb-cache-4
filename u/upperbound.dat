40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} the Gaussian interference channel with an intermediate relay. The relay {{is assumed to}} have abundant power and is named potent for that reason. A main reason to consider this model is to find good outerbounds for the Gaussian interference relay channel (GIFRC) with finite relay power. By setting {{the power of the}} relay constraint to infinity, we show that the capacity region is asymptotically equivalent to the case when the relay-destination links are noiseless and orthogonal to other links. The capacity region of the latter provides an outerbound for the GIFRC with finite relay power. We then show the capacity region of the former can be upper bounded by a single-inputmultiple-output interference channel with an antenna common to both receivers. To establish the sum capacity of this channel, we study the strong and the weak interference regimes. For both regimes, we show that the <b>upperbounds</b> we find are achievable, thus establishing the sum capacity of GIFRC with the potent relay. Both results, in turn, serve as <b>upperbounds</b> for the sum capacity of the GIFRC with finite relay power. Numerical results show that the <b>upperbounds</b> are close to the known achievable rates for many scenarios of interest. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{random coding}} bound of {{information}} theory provides a well-known upper {{bound to the}} probability of decoding error for the best code of a given rate and block length. The bound is constructed by <b>upperbounding</b> the average error probability over an ensemble of codes.

Here we derive an asymptotic expression for the average error probability over the ensemble of codes used in the random coding bound. The result shows that {{the weakness of the}} random coding bound at rates below the second critical rate is due not to <b>upperbounding</b> the ensemble average, but rather {{to the fact that the}} best codes are much better than the average at low rates...|$|R
