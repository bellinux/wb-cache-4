5|$|Coolsma {{found that}} Sundanese {{literature}} consisted predominantly of poetry, including the narrative wawacan, {{and thought that}} prose needed to be developed as well so that the people would embrace modernity. He considered that they rarely read, instead preferring to listen to more educated persons sing in verse. As such, the contents of written prose would not be conveyed. This {{is not to say}} that he disliked Sundanese poetry; he was appreciative of the dangding verse forms– derived from Javanese literary tradition– which were <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> wawacan, and considered an existing translation of the Gospel of Matthew in dangding to be the best Sundanese-language book in print.|$|E
5|$|Handscroll: The handscroll {{originated}} from ancient Chinese text documents. From the Spring and Autumn period (770-481 BCE) through the Han dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE), bamboo or wooden slips were bound and <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> texts on. During the Eastern Han period (25-220), {{the use of}} paper and silk as handscrolls became more common. The handscroll was {{the one of the}} main formats for texts up until the Tang dynasty (618-907). Since the Three Kingdoms (220–280), the handscroll became a standard form for mounting artwork. New styles were developed over time.|$|E

At May's Extreme Rules, Cena won the title in a triple threat steel cage match against The Miz and Morrison.

5|$|Khmer {{differs from}} {{neighboring}} languages such as Thai, Burmese, Lao and Vietnamese {{in that it}} is not a tonal language. Words are stressed on the final syllable, hence many words conform to the typical Mon–Khmer pattern of a stressed syllable preceded by a minor syllable. The language has been written in the Khmer script, an abugida descended from the Brahmi script via the southern Indian Pallava script, since at least the seventh century. The script's form and use has evolved over the centuries; its modern features include subscripted versions of consonants <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> clusters and a division of consonants into two series with different inherent vowels. Approximately 79% of Cambodians are able to read Khmer.|$|E
5|$|The Georgian scripts are {{the three}} writing systems <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> the Georgian language: Asomtavruli, Nuskhuri and Mkhedruli. Although the systems differ in appearance, all three are unicase, their letters share the same names and {{alphabetical}} order, and are written horizontally from left to right. Of the three scripts, Mkhedruli was once the civilian royal script of the Kingdom of Georgia mostly used for the royal charters {{and is now the}} standard script for modern Georgian and its related Kartvelian languages, whereas Asomtavruli and Nuskhuri are used only in ceremonial religious texts and iconography by the Georgian Orthodox Church.|$|E

5|$|Duke Nukem Forever {{was officially}} {{announced}} on April 28, 1997, {{with the intention}} of releasing the game no later than mid-1998. Barely a year after the release of Duke Nukem 3D, the game's graphics and its game engine, the Build engine, were antiquated. Id Software's new Quake II engine was far superior to Build, so Broussard decided to license it. The price spent for the licensing rights was steep—estimates were as high as $500,000—but Broussard reasoned that it would save time <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a game engine from scratch. Broussard and Miller were flush with cash from the sales of Duke Nukem 3D and other games, so they decided to fund Duke Nukem Forever themselves, turning marketing and publishing rights over to GT Interactive.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian {{literature}} was produced {{on a variety}} of media. Along with the chisel, necessary for making inscriptions on stone, the chief writing tool of ancient Egypt was the reed pen, a reed fashioned into a stem with a bruised, brush-like end. With pigments of carbon black and red ochre, the reed pen was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> on scrolls of papyrus—a thin material made from beating together strips of pith from the Cyperus papyrus plant—as well as on small ceramic or limestone ostraca known as potsherds. It is thought that papyrus rolls were moderately expensive commercial items, since many are palimpsests, manuscripts that have their original contents erased to make room for new written works. This, alongside tearing off pieces of papyrus documents to make smaller letters, suggests that there were seasonal shortages caused by the limited growing season of Cyperus papyrus. It also explains the frequent use of ostraca and limestone flakes as writing media for shorter written works. In addition to stone, ceramic ostraca, and papyrus, writing media also included wood, ivory, and plaster.|$|E
5|$|Punic, the Semitic {{language}} of the Carthaginians, continued {{to be used in}} North Africa during the Imperial period. Before the Roman conquest in 146 BC, nearly all Punic inscriptions had been votives to the deities Tanit and Ba'al or funerary commemorations, but during the Roman era a broader range of content is found in Neo-Punic, often appearing with parallel texts in Latin or Greek. A striking occurrence of Neo-Punic is found at the otherwise thoroughly Roman temple of Roma and Augustus, built 14–19 AD at Leptis Magna. One of the latest Neo-Punic inscriptions on a monument dates to the reign of Domitian (81–96 AD). No inscription in Punic script on stone can be dated later than the 2nd or 3rd century. Latin script was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> Punic in the 4th and 5th centuries.|$|E

5|$|The Ottawa {{writing system}} is a minor {{adaptation}} of a very similar one used for other dialects of Ojibwe in Ontario and the United States, and widely employed in reference materials and text collections. Sometimes {{referred to as the}} Double Vowel system because it uses doubled vowel symbols to represent Ottawa long vowels that are paired with corresponding short vowels, it is an adaptation attributed to Charles Fiero of the linguistically oriented system found in publications such as Leonard Bloomfield’s Eastern Ojibwa. Letters of the English alphabet substitute for specialized phonetic symbols, in conjunction with orthographic conventions unique to Ottawa. The system embodies two basic principles: (1) alphabetic letters from the English alphabet are <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> Ottawa, but with Ottawa sound values; (2) the system is phonemic in nature, in that each letter or letter combination indicates its basic sound value, and does not reflect all the phonetic detail that occurs. Accurate pronunciation cannot be learned without consulting a fluent speaker.|$|E
5|$|The {{record is}} known for the {{difficulty}} Priestess encountered in trying to release it. The band's extensive touring schedule for their previous album Hello Master consumed {{much of the time}} they would have <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> new material, and after they began doing so, they had disputes with RCA Records, their international distributor at the time, as to whether the new songs were acceptable. After the completion of the recording sessions, which were themselves problematic, RCA ultimately refused to release the album, fearing it was not commercial enough, but allowed the group to release it on another label. Tee Pee Records signed the group thereafter and released the album internationally. Priestess were still signed to Indica Records, but only for Canadian distribution; the release on Indica was withheld until an international distributor was found.|$|E
5|$|Writer Mike Scully came up {{with the}} idea for the plot because he used to live in West Springfield, Massachusetts and he would ask his parents if he could take the bus to Springfield, Massachusetts and they finally agreed to let him one day. The {{production}} team faced several challenges during development of this episode. The animators had to come up with a special mouth chart to draw Bart's mouth with the joke teeth in. The pile of dead animals in the back of Cletus' truck originally included dead puppies, but the animators thought it was too sad, so they removed them. Scully <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> jokes for Yakov Smirnoff so he called him up to get the signs in Russian.

5|$|The {{night after}} WrestleMania, Orton demanded a rematch, {{threatening}} Linda McMahon (Vince's wife) {{as well as}} their grandchildren. McMahon did not grant him the rematch but scheduled a six-man tag team match for the pay-per-view Backlash between Triple H and Shane and Vince McMahon and The Legacy, with a preview that evening between Vince and Orton. However, Raw's general manager at that time, Vickie Guerrero, made their six-man tag team match a WWE Championship match. The stipulation was that if Triple H's team won, he retained the championship, while if The Legacy won, Orton would win the title. As the singles match progressed, Shane and Triple H came to Vince's aid, causing both Rhodes and DiBiase to interfere until a returning Batista appeared and cleared the ring; McMahon then announced that Batista was to replace him in the match at Backlash. At the event, Orton won by pinning Triple H after an RKO and a running punt, leaving Triple H hospitalized according to the storyline. In spite of Triple H's absence, Shane McMahon continued his feud with the group, leading to another match between him and Orton on Raw. After the original match ended in a no contest due to interference, Rhodes and DiBiase won singles matches to be entered into a handicap match with all of The Legacy facing Shane later that night. This match was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> him out of the storyline, as The Legacy members used the steel ring steps to shatter his ankle.|$|E
5|$|On the December 3 Raw, Orton began a {{feud with}} The Shield, {{after he was}} {{attacked}} by them following a victory over Brad Maddox. On the December 14 SmackDown, Orton was once again assaulted backstage by The Shield. This was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> him off television due to a shoulder injury. Orton returned on the New Year’s Eve Raw, helping Ryback and Sheamus fend off The Shield. On the January 4 SmackDown, Orton declared his entry in the 2013 Royal Rumble match. On the January 11 SmackDown and the January 16 Main Event, Orton was again attacked by The Shield during his matches with Antonio Cesaro. On the February 1 SmackDown, Orton defeated longtime rival Wade Barrett to earn {{a spot in the}} Elimination Chamber match. On February 17 at Elimination Chamber, Orton eliminated Mark Henry and Chris Jericho before being the last man eliminated by Jack Swagger. In late February, Orton aligned himself with Sheamus to feud with the Shield. Over the next weeks, Orton and Sheamus saved each other from attacks by The Shield and Big Show. On the March 15 SmackDown, Orton and Sheamus were then allowed to pick a third partner to face the Shield in a six-man tag team match at Wrestlemania 29 an chose Ryback. Three days later on Raw, however, Ryback was booked in another match for the event, leaving the spot open. Later that night, Big Show saved the two from an attack by The Shield and was immediately recruited as their partner. On April 7 at WrestleMania 29, Orton, Sheamus and Show were defeated by The Shield, after which, both men were knocked out by Show. The following night on Raw, Orton and Sheamus faced off in a match to earn a match with Big Show, however, the match ended in a no contest after Show interfered. Orton and Sheamus then teamed up to defeat Show in two handicap matches, first on the April 12 SmackDown via count-out, and second on the April 15 Raw via pinfall. On the April 19 SmackDown, Orton and Sheamus were defeated by Big Show and Mark Henry in a tag team match. The feud between Big Show and Orton led to an Extreme Rules match at Extreme Rules, which Orton won.|$|E
