They also bring stipulations from different contracts <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>denominator.</b> The lower the cost of measuring an attribute and the wider the range of its application, the higher the likelihood that the attribute will become subject to new standards. New standards are predicted to increase the role of contracts in agreements and to reduce that of long-term relations; to lower the prices of the commodities that use the standards; to increase the rate of theft of these commodities; and, by making it clearer what it is that parties exchange, to reduce the level of vertical integration. Finally, new standards propel markets toward perfect competition. (JEL D 23, L 14, L 15, L 22) Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press. ...|$|E
40|$|What are digital comics? The {{answers to}} this {{question}} are diverse and often contradictory. Since digital comics were first published in the 1990 s, it {{has not always been}} possible to gather them <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>denominator,</b> apart from what already defines (with difficulty) printed comics. Many digital comics frequently resort to skeuomorphism, a digital reproduction of printed comics’ most salient aspects. This shows a deference of digital comics to print: some scholars see in digital comics only a technological variation of pre-existent means of distribution. Should digital comics move away from print to earn their own place? Are digital comics lacking a masterpiece that could establish their legitimacy? Should they exploit the potentialities of digital art and offer interactivity, moving images, new formats to gain their independence? This article argues that asking these questions is to try to reconcile the disparities of digital comics and see how scholars, cartoonists and publishers all try to give digital comics a specific status, for different reasons, but sharing a common goal...|$|E
40|$|What {{characterizes the}} {{literature}} of the transition? ln the late medieval period the forms and aspirations of literary endeavor stood in clear continuity with those of the High Middle Ages; but they were also rapidly expanding in scope, with many innovations that would become important for the Renaissance and the Rcformation. [ [...] . ] Bringing all these elements <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>denominator</b> we may say that the intellectual life of the centuries of transition showed a great openness to new ideas - an openness that stands in contrast both to the more rigid cognitive hierarchies of the High Middle Ages and to the entrenched positions of the Reformation. The resulting diversification of German literature reveals itself in the new forms of writing pioneered by new classes of writers for ever-widening circles of readers. We shall observe this increased diversity in the traditional centers of literary production, the court and the cloister, but even more so in the new literary world of the cities. And we shall see the parallel rise of Iewish literary awareness as belonging in die same broad context. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{looks at}} three voluntary societies formed in London {{shortly after the}} revolution of 1688. These societies, with overlapping membership, shared a broad vision {{for the improvement of}} manners and morals throughout the burgeoning British Empire. The Society for Reformation of Manners, founded in 1691, called for the enforcement of the civil laws against prostitution, swearing, drunkenness, gambling, and other moral crimes. The Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, founded in 1698, established schools and distributed books [...] forming some of the first public lending libraries [...] throughout England and its colonies. The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, founded in 1701, sent missionaries abroad to convert, educate and civilize the European settlers, African slaves, and American Indians. I show that in response to the uncertainties of the post-revolutionary period and the establishment of religious toleration in 1689, religiously motivated reformers advanced new ideas about the nature of society. They looked to shared manners, habits, customs and mores [...] rather than shared religious beliefs and practices [...] as the binding agents of society. Reformers described the benefits good manners brought individuals and communities; good manners, they said, were essential to a stable, commercial, tolerant society. Thus I show that some of the most religious people in this period spoke in secular terms. As the ideas and practices of religious toleration became more firmly rooted in English society, people turned to manners as the glue that held the community [...] or nation [...] together. This is the birth of a particular strand of social thinking. This dissertations then follows the process by which ideas of religious diversity were transformed {{in the context of the}} colonies. The societies hoped to encourage better [...] and more uniform [...] manners and habits on both sides of the Atlantic, bringing all peoples of the empire <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> cultural <b>denominator.</b> In doing so, they created a new imperial ideology. An explication of the writings of these reformers, then, offers new insights into the making of secular culture in the Atlantic World and the origins of the Enlightenment in England...|$|R

40|$|While the {{humanities}} and the sciences have a closely connected history, there are no general histories that bring the two fields together on an equal footing. This paper argues {{that there is a}} level at which some humanistic and scientific disciplines can be brought <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>denominator</b> and compared. This is at the level of underlying methods, especially at the level of formalisms and rule systems used by different disciplines. The essay formally compares linguistics and computer science by noting that the same grammar formalism was used in the 1950 s for describing both human and programming languages. Additionally, it examines the influence of philology on molecular biology, and vice versa, by recognizing that the tree-formalism and rule system used for text reconstruction was also employed in DNA genetics. It also shows that rule systems for source criticism in history are used in forensic science, evidence-based medicine, and jurisprudence. This paper thus opens up a new comparative approach within which the histories of {{the humanities}} and the sciences can be examined on a common level...|$|E
40|$|Two {{definitions}} of division by an interval containing zero are compared: a functional {{one and a}} relational one. We show that the relational definition also provides interval inverses for other functions {{that do not have}} point inverses, such as max and the absolute-value function. Applying the same approach to the ≤ relation introduces the “companion functions ” of relations. By regarding the arithmetic operations +, −, ∗, and / as ternary relations, we obtain the interval versions of the operations. This opens the way for regarding arithmetic problems such as evaluating expressions and solving equations as Constraint Satisfaction Problems (csps). These have a useful computational theory, which is, however, influenced by their predominantly discrete applications. We generalize the conventional formulation to better accommodate real-valued variables, and state the main results. When these results are applied to numerical csps we relate the interval evaluation of an arithmetic expression to the family of solving algorithms of csps. The key to our method of bringing interval arithmetic and interval constraints <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>denominator</b> are companion functions. These functions form an alternative characterization of n-ary relations and appear to be a new contribution to the mathematical theory of relations...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} contended {{that it would}} be {{possible}} for a socialist economy {{to solve the problem of}} economic calculation by applying the equations by the aid of which mathematical economics describes the conditions of economic equilibrium. This view made its first appearance in an article by Barone published in 1908 1; since then it has been advanced time and again and enjoys marked popularity at the present time. Hayek has shown the practical difficulties which stand in the way of this attempt at solving the problem. The calculation would have to include all conceivable uses, and ways of combining all available goods. Moreover it is not sufficient here to bring together <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>denominator</b> all the quantities of goods which appear to form a single class from a technological standpoint. Since the economic profitability of transporting goods from place to place must be reflected in the equations, and since the latter must also solve all problems of location, goods which are similar from a technological point of view, but which are not available for use at the same place must appear in the calculation as independent items. If Hayek (1935, pp. 207 – 14) estimates the order of magnitude of the number of necessary equations and calculations as hundreds of thousands, this i...|$|E

40|$|Public surrenders {{of land in}} Spain must receive strong {{legislative}} support due to {{the existence}} of an eminently private town planning initiative. Thus, the quantities of facilities, green spaces and areas for road use will be regulated in the different town planning laws of autonomous regions, this being a far cry from what could initially seem political will or decisions at the whim of the town councils. The aim was to study the surrenders of facilities in Catalonia {{within the framework of the}} other Autonomous Regions of Spain, the context required for the correct comprehension of the prevailing situation. Based on <b>a</b> hypothesis of <b>common</b> town planning parameters, the Town Planning Act of each Autonomous Region has been applied. The heterogeneity of surrenders between Autonomous Regions and the range of options for the provision of collective assets deriving from this endangers the Spanish public facility provision model in general. It is difficult to understand how <b>under</b> <b>a</b> minimum <b>common</b> <b>denominator</b> of power and a theoretically fair system of funding Autonomous Regions there is such a broad margin of regulation and results of surrender. Whilst the different town planning laws allow public land to be obtained through surrenders by private developers in favour of the local government, a second legislative package regulates the services to be provided in the facility plots previously obtained. The different municipal and local laws drafted by the Autonomous Regions within the framework of basic Spanish law require a series of services from the municipal government according to the population of the municipality. With laws of such diverse origin and mandate, it is inevitable that doubt will be cast over the obliged convergence. will sufficient land be obtained from town planning laws to accommodate the facilities deriving from the application of municipal laws? And further, is a state Act valid as a response to the broad Spanish municipal idiosyncrasy? With this, residential growth seems to be the most important way to obtain public land, what, then, should be the "minimum urban expression" to guarantee a sufficient contribution of surrendered land? All urban services or activities appear <b>under</b> <b>a</b> "minimum threshold", which at the same time defines the "minimum unit". A certain level of population is required for the existence of commerce, a service, etc.; the area moves up a rung when the population volume reaches the next threshold. Facilities also participate in this "jump process", as do all other urban activities. What should this minimum facility provision be? The most basic and universal services, which should be guaranteed for everyone, are education, healthcare and social services. In order to guarantee these as the most basic facilities, they must be appropriately legislated. As they are directly linked to the end user they can be standardized. On the contrary, it is not considered convenient to provide standards for all facilities, as many of them would correspond to a second type known as "circumstantial", more linked to the characteristics of the urban centre, which will lend them their purpose and meaning in terms of use. In Catalonia, "the label of use" for land allocated to facilities is proposed in the plan after consultation with the competent body of the Autonomous Government of Catalonia. Thus, the municipalities receive insufficiently a percentage of the general state budgets, from which -among other expenses- they must fund the provision of minimum services that far exceed those stipulated in municipal law, and which when all is said and done are programmed and planned by government of the Autonomous Region. This chaos of power and funding makes difficult to apply the policies of the Autonomous Government. The different departments draft plans and programmes with contents and objectives taken basically from the experience of whoever writes them. A few departments are the exception to this. Different bodies in the European Union produce reference values for the areas of healthcare, education, sport and culture. The departments that have these use them either for programming or for evaluation purposes. By producing indicators in this way, the EU is demonstrating a growing concern for the quality of social infrastructures, allowing dissemination of levels of service provision. There can be no quality without controlling quantity. In the increasingly more homogenous European space, where member states exchange and share information, it has become necessary to establish some qualitative and quantitative minimums for the basic and universal provision of facilities, which should materialize in European standards of social infrastructures.
