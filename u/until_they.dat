5|$|A few species release fertilized {{eggs into}} the water, but most retain the eggs <b>until</b> <b>they</b> hatch. There are {{four types of}} larvae, but all are balls of cells with an outer layer of cells whose flagellae or cilia enable the larvae to move. After {{swimming}} {{for a few days}} the larvae sink and crawl <b>until</b> <b>they</b> find a place to settle. Most of the cells transform into archeocytes and then into the types appropriate for their locations in a miniature adult sponge.|$|E

5|$|Depending on maturity, breed, {{and work}} expected, horses are usually put under saddle and {{trained to be}} ridden {{between the ages of}} two and four. Although Thoroughbred race horses are put on the track as young as the age of two in some countries, horses {{specifically}} bred for sports such as dressage are generally not put under saddle <b>until</b> <b>they</b> are three or four years old, because their bones and muscles are not solidly developed. For endurance riding competition, horses are not deemed mature enough to compete <b>until</b> <b>they</b> are a full 60calendar months (five years) old.|$|E

They are able to fly after five to six months, but continue to roost and forage with their parents <b>until</b> <b>they</b> are in their second year, at which point the parents typically turn their energies to a new nest. Ravens are the main predatory threat to condor eggs, while golden eagles and bears are potential predators of condor offspring.|$|E

5|$|A {{dominant}} cub {{emerges in}} most litters, usually a male. This cub is more active than its siblings {{and takes the}} lead in their play, eventually leaving its mother and becoming independent earlier. The cubs open their eyes at six to fourteen days old. By eight weeks, the cubs make short ventures outside the den with their mother, although they do not travel with her as she roams her territory <b>until</b> <b>they</b> are older. The cubs are nursed for three to six months. Around {{the time they are}} weaned, they start to accompany their mother on territorial walks and they are taught how to hunt. The cubs often become capable (and nearly adult size) hunters at eleven months old. The cubs become independent around eighteen months of age, but it is not <b>until</b> <b>they</b> are around two to {{two and a half years}} old that they fully separate from their mother. Females reach sexual maturity at three to four years, whereas males do so at four to five years.|$|E
