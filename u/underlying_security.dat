25|$|Binary option– An all-or-nothing {{option that}} pays {{the full amount}} if the <b>underlying</b> <b>security</b> meets the defined {{condition}} on expiration otherwise it expires.|$|E
25|$|An {{option is}} at the money (ATM) if the strike price {{is the same as}} the current spot price of the <b>underlying</b> <b>security.</b> An {{at-the-money}} option has no intrinsic value, only time value.|$|E
25|$|These trades are {{described}} {{from the point}} of view of a speculator. If they are combined with other positions, they can also be used in hedging. An option contract in US markets usually represents 100 shares of the <b>underlying</b> <b>security.</b>|$|E
50|$|A premium {{might be}} due to the market's {{confidence}} in the investment managers' ability or the <b>underlying</b> <b>securities</b> to produce above-market returns. A discount might reflect the charges to be deducted from the fund in future by the managers, uncertainty due to high amounts of leverage, concerns related to liquidity or lack of investor confidence in the <b>underlying</b> <b>securities.</b>|$|R
50|$|Interests in {{securities}} {{are always}} intangible. The only evidence of them comprises electronic records. Interests in securities confer property rights {{in relation to}} the <b>underlying</b> <b>securities,</b> and in some cases these <b>underlying</b> <b>securities</b> comprise tangible bearer instruments. However, {{this does not mean that}} interests in securities are themselves tangible. They are unallocated, and therefore do not attach to any tangible asset.|$|R
50|$|The {{so-called}} Type I PRIMA {{dates back}} to the late 1960s, in Belgium. Under Belgian law, the interest in respect of the <b>underlying</b> <b>securities</b> held by an investor and recorded on the books of its intermediary is treated as a different asset from the <b>underlying</b> <b>securities.</b> Thus the Belgian approach is an application of PRIMA, as well as being linked to the lex rei sitae tradition.|$|R
25|$|An out of {{the money}} (OTM) option has no {{intrinsic}} value. A call option is {{out of the}} money when the strike price is above the spot price of the <b>underlying</b> <b>security.</b> A put option is {{out of the money}} when the strike price is below the spot price.|$|E
25|$|Strategies {{are often}} used to {{engineer}} a particular risk profile to movements in the <b>underlying</b> <b>security.</b> For example, buying a butterfly spread (long one X1 call, short two X2 calls, and long one X3 call) allows a trader to profit if the stock price on the expiration date is near the middle exercise price, X2, and does not expose the trader to a large loss.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the market}} crash of 1987, {{it has been}} {{observed}} that market implied volatility for options of lower strike prices are typically higher than for higher strike prices, suggesting that volatility is stochastic, varying both for time and for the price level of the <b>underlying</b> <b>security.</b> Stochastic volatility models have been developed including one developed by S.L. Heston. One principal advantage of the Heston model is that it can be solved in closed-form, while other stochastic volatility models require complex numerical methods.|$|E

50|$|Such an {{approach}} causes problems in some legal systems, notable {{of which are}} those of Japan and Germany. Under both their systems, an investor would be treated as the direct owner of the <b>underlying</b> <b>securities</b> even though the security is held through tiers of intermediaries. The direct ownership in the <b>underlying</b> <b>securities</b> {{makes it difficult to}} argue that the location of the asset is at the level of an intermediary.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the {{look-through}} approach, PRIMA {{does not}} look through the various tiers of intermediaries to the <b>underlying</b> <b>securities.</b> Rather, it stops {{at the level of}} the intermediary immediately above the parties to the pledge or transfer. Its important advantage is that it subjects an investor's interest in securities to the law of a single jurisdiction, even where evidence of <b>underlying</b> <b>securities</b> is situated in many different countries, or where various issuers in a single portfolio is involved. This provides certainty and clarity for all parties involved.|$|R

2500|$|The {{intrinsic}} value (or [...] "monetary value") of an option is its value assuming it were exercised immediately. Thus {{if the current}} (spot) price of the <b>underlying</b> <b>security</b> (or commodity etc.) is above the agreed (strike) price, a call has positive {{intrinsic value}} (and is called [...] "in the money"), while a put has zero intrinsic value (and is [...] "out of the money").|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesExchange Traded Products (ETPs) {{have become}} {{important}} {{members of the}} investment universe. They are praised by institutional and retail investors alike for their low cost, transparency and efficient pricing mechanisms. ETPs trade much like equity securities but with a unique creation and redemption mechanism which typically aligns quoted prices with the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the <b>underlying</b> <b>securities.</b> This dissertation examines a class of ETPs whose underlying reference basket consists of securities listed on stock exchanges operating in a time zone different to the time zone of the ETP instrument itself, and whose currencies of the <b>underlying</b> <b>securities</b> are different to the currency of the ETP instrument. The ETP instruments reviewed comprise of the iShares MSCI Country Series and are all listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The ETPs are classified into three groups depending {{on the degree of}} overlap between the exchange operating times on which their <b>underlying</b> <b>securities</b> are traded and the exchange operating times of the NYSE. These groups are non-synchronous for no overlapping hours, partially synchronous for some overlapping hours and synchronous for overlapping hours. By assessing a measure of range-based volatility during 15 -minute intra-day intervals throughout the NYSE trading day, an understanding of the volatility profile of these ETPs is determined and analysed. It is found that non-synchronous ETPs do exhibit a higher relative level of volatility when compared to the partially synchronous group. Within the partially synchronous group, evidence of a regime-shift is observed during the period when the market of the <b>underlying</b> <b>securities</b> transitions from open to closed during the NYSE trading session. Another factor observed in the relative volatility profile is the impact of foreign exchange translation. ETPs with <b>underlying</b> <b>securities</b> priced in an emerging market currency show higher relative levels of range-based volatility. However, both emerging market and developed market denominated securities baskets exhibit relatively higher levels of volatility during the opening and closing periods of the US trading day. The results point to the need for caution and understanding of the underlying reference basket when transacting in these ETPs as investors may inadvertently transact at a price which does not reflect the fair-market value of the <b>underlying</b> <b>securities</b> basket due to price distortions as a result of volatility...|$|R
2500|$|In most countries, strip {{bonds are}} {{primarily}} administered by {{a central bank}} or central securities depository. [...] An alternative form {{is to use a}} custodian bank or trust company to hold the <b>underlying</b> <b>security</b> and a transfer agent/registrar to track ownership in the strip bonds and to administer the program. [...] Physically created strip bonds (where the coupons are physically clipped and then traded separately) were created {{in the early days of}} stripping in Canada and the U.S., but have virtually disappeared due to the high costs and risks associated with them.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{there are}} also many differences, the most {{important}} being that an insurance contract provides an indemnity against the losses actually suffered by the policy holder on an asset in which it holds an insurable interest. [...] By contrast a CDS provides an equal payout to all holders, calculated using an agreed, market-wide method. [...] The holder {{does not need to}} own the <b>underlying</b> <b>security</b> and does not even have to suffer a loss from the default event. The CDS can therefore be used to speculate on debt objects.|$|E
2500|$|Relative value {{arbitrage}} strategies {{take advantage}} of relative discrepancies in price between securities. The price discrepancy can occur due to mispricing of securities compared to related securities, the <b>underlying</b> <b>security</b> or the market overall. Hedge fund managers can use various types of analysis to identify price discrepancies in securities, including mathematical, technical or fundamental techniques. Relative value is often used as a synonym for market neutral, as strategies in this category typically have very little or no directional market exposure to the market as a whole. Other relative value sub-strategies include: ...|$|E

2500|$|In finance, {{an option}} is a {{contract}} {{which gives the}} buyer (the holder of the option) the right, but not the obligation, {{to buy or sell}} an underlying asset or instrument at a specific strike price on a specified date, depending on the form of the option. The strike price may be set by reference to the spot price (market price) of the <b>underlying</b> <b>security</b> or commodity on the day an option is taken out, or it may be fixed at a discount in a premium. The seller has the corresponding obligation to fulfill the transaction—to sell or buy—if the buyer (owner) [...] "exercises" [...] the option. An option that conveys to the owner the right to buy at a specific price is referred to as a call; an option that conveys the right of the owner to sell at a specific price is referred to as a put. Both are commonly used in and [...] by the old traded, but the call option is more frequently discussed.|$|E
50|$|A {{conditional}} variance swap {{is a type}} of swap {{derivative product}} that allows investors to take exposure to volatility in the price of an <b>underlying</b> <b>security</b> only while the <b>underlying</b> <b>security</b> is within a pre-specified price range. This ability could be useful for hedging complex volatility exposures, making a bet on the volatility levels contained in the skew of the underlying security's price, or buying/selling variance at more attractive levels given a view on the <b>underlying</b> <b>security.</b>|$|E
50|$|If {{a spread}} is {{designed}} to profit from {{a rise in the}} price of the <b>underlying</b> <b>security,</b> it is a bull spread. A bear spread is a spread where favorable outcome is obtained when the price of the <b>underlying</b> <b>security</b> goes down.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – In 2001, Euronext-Liffe {{introduced}} single security futures {{contracts for}} the first time. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine the impact that these single security futures had on the volatility of the underlying stocks. Design/methodology/approach – The Inclan and Tiao algorithm was used to show that the volatility of <b>underlying</b> <b>securities</b> did not change after universal futures were introduced. Findings – It was found that in the aftermath of the introduction of universal futures the volatility of the <b>underlying</b> <b>securities</b> increases. Increased volatility is not apparent in the control sample. This suggests that single security futures did have some impact on the volatility of the <b>underlying</b> <b>securities.</b> Originality/value – Despite the huge literature that has examined the effects of a futures listing on the volatility of underlying stock returns, little consensus has emerged. This paper adds to the dialogue by focusing on the effects of a single security futures contract rather than concentrating on the effects of index futures contracts.

2500|$|Some index ETFs invest 100% {{of their}} assets proportionately in the <b>securities</b> <b>underlying</b> an index, a manner of {{investing}} called replication.

There are various ways the ETF can be weighted, such as equal weighting or revenue weighting.
