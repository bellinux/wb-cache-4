5|$|Metallic {{scandium}} {{was produced}} {{for the first}} time in 1937 by electrolysis of a eutectic mixture of potassium, lithium, and scandium chlorides, at 700–800°C. The first pound of 99% pure scandium metal was produced in 1960. Production of aluminium alloys began in 1971, following a <b>US</b> <b>patent.</b> Aluminium-scandium alloys were also developed in the USSR.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{was invented}} by Nariman Mehta of Burroughs Wellcome (now GlaxoSmithKline) in 1969, and the <b>US</b> <b>patent</b> for it was granted in 1974. It was {{approved}} by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an antidepressant on 30 December 1985, and marketed under the name Wellbutrin. However, a significant incidence of epileptic seizures at the originally recommended dosage caused the withdrawal of the drug in 1986. Subsequently, the risk of seizures was found to be highly dose-dependent, and bupropion was re-introduced to the market in 1989 with a lower maximum recommended daily dose.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell {{was awarded}} the first <b>U.S.</b> <b>patent</b> for the telephone. Thomas Edison's {{research}} laboratory, {{one of the first}} of its kind, developed the phonograph, the first long-lasting light bulb, and the first viable movie camera. The latter lead to emergence of the worldwide entertainment industry. In the early 20th century, the automobile companies of Ransom E. Olds and Henry Ford popularized the assembly line. The Wright brothers, in 1903, made the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} 5.7×28mm cartridge, {{called the}} SS90, {{was introduced in}} 1990. It used a 1.5 gram (23grain) plastic-core projectile, which was propelled at a muzzle velocity of roughly 850m/s (2,800ft/s or Mach 2.5) when fired from the P90. A United States patent application for the projectile design used in the SS90 was filed by FN's Jean-Paul Denis and Marc Neuforge in 1989. <b>U.S.</b> <b>Patent</b> 5,012,743 ("High-Performance Projectile") was received in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Dayton {{has been}} the home for many patents and inventions since the 1870s. According to the National Park Service, citing {{information}} from the <b>U.S.</b> <b>Patent</b> Office, Dayton had granted more patents per capita than any other U.S. city in 1890 and ranked fifth in the nation as early as 1870. The Wright brothers, inventors of the airplane, and Charles F. Kettering, world-renowned for his numerous inventions, hailed from Dayton. The city was also home to James Ritty's Incorruptible Cashier, the first mechanical cash register, and Arthur E. Morgan's hydraulic jump, a flood prevention mechanism that helped pioneer hydraulic engineering. Paul Laurence Dunbar, an African-American poet and novelist, penned his most famous works in the late 19th century and became {{an integral part of}} the city's history.|$|E

5|$|When {{production}} of Aspirin began in 1899, Bayer sent out small packets {{of the drug}} to doctors, pharmacists and hospitals, advising them of Aspirin's uses and encouraging them to publish about the drug's effects and effectiveness. As positive results came in and enthusiasm grew, Bayer sought to secure patent and trademark wherever possible. It was ineligible for patent in Germany (despite being accepted briefly before the decision was overturned), but Aspirin was patented in Britain (filed 22 December 1898) and the United States (<b>US</b> <b>Patent</b> 644,077 issued 27 February 1900). The British patent was overturned in 1905, the American patent was also besieged but was ultimately upheld.|$|E
5|$|A 1951 letter {{showed that}} Bradner clearly {{understood}} that the insulation in such a suit was not provided by the water between the suit and the skin, but rather that this layer of water next to the skin, if trapped, would quickly heat to skin temperature, if the material in the suit were insulative. Thus, the suit only needed to limit purging by fresh cold water, {{and it did not}} need to be dry to work. He applied for a <b>U.S.</b> <b>patent</b> for the wetsuit, but his patent application was turned down due to its similar design with the flight suit. The United States Navy also did not adopt the new wetsuits because of worries that the neoprene in the wetsuits might make its swimmers easier to spot by underwater sonar and, thus, could not exclusively profit from his invention.|$|E
5|$|The P90 uses {{a unique}} {{horizontally}} mounted feeding system—patented in the United States—that {{contributes to the}} weapon's compact profile and unusual appearance. <b>U.S.</b> <b>Patent</b> 4,905,394 ("Top mounted longitudinal magazine") was awarded in 1990, naming René Predazzer as the sole inventor. The detachable box magazine is mounted parallel to the P90's barrel, fitting flush with {{the top of the}} weapon's frame, and it contains 50 rounds of ammunition which lie in two rows facing left, offset 90° from the bore axis. As the cartridges are pushed back by spring pressure and arrive at the rear end of the magazine, they are fed as a single row into a spiral feed ramp and rotated 90 degrees, aligning them with the chamber. The magazine body is composed of polymer, and it is semi-transparent to allow the shooter to see the amount of ammunition remaining at any time.|$|E

5|$|The bridge's Whipple truss {{technology}} {{was developed in}} 1847 by civil engineer Squire Whipple, who received a patent from the <b>U.S.</b> <b>Patent</b> Office the same year. Whipple {{was one of the}} first structural engineers to use scientific and mathematical methods analyzing the forces and stresses in framed structures to design the bridge, and his groundbreaking 1847 book, A Work on Bridge Building, had a significant influence on bridge engineering. Whipple's truss bridge design incorporated double-intersection diagonals into the standard Pratt truss, thus allowing the diagonals to extend across two truss bays. Engineer J. W. Murphy further modified Whipple's truss design in 1859 when he designed the first truss bridge with pinned eyebar connections, which utilized pins instead of trunnions. Murphy's design removed the need for riveted connections and allowed for easier and more widespread construction of truss bridges. In 1863, Murphy designed the first pin-connected truss bridge with both wrought iron tension and compression components and cast iron joint blocks and pedestals. Murphy's truss design consisted of double-intersection counter-diagonals, and along with the eyebar and pin connections, permitted longer iron bridge spans.|$|E
5|$|UND {{has three}} major {{libraries}} which, together, form the largest system of research libraries {{in the state}} of North Dakota. The Chester Fritz Library is the largest library in the state. It houses 1.6 million volumes, provides access to approximately 28,000 electronic journal subscriptions, and owns over 20,000 electronic books. It also serves as a <b>U.S.</b> <b>patent</b> and trademark depository and a government document depository. UND's special collections department is known for its genealogical resources, including Norwegian Bygdeboker, or Norwegian farm and town records. Branches of the Chester Fritz Library include the Energy and Environmental Research Library, the F.D. Holland Geology Library, and the Gordon Erickson Music Library. The School of Law operates the Thormodsgard Law Library and the School of Medicine operates the Harley E. French Library of the Health Sciences.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} {{persistence}} and attempts at marketing, Evans's designs were finally given a trial on larger scales and adopted elsewhere. A breakthrough came in 1789 when the Ellicotts, a progressively minded Quaker family in Baltimore, invited Evans to refit their mills on the Patapsco River. The refits proved a success, and Evans worked with Jonathan Ellicott {{to develop a}} modified form of Archimedean screw that could act as a horizontal conveyor to work alongside the vertically orientated bucket elevators. He added a rake-drill and conveyor belt to his designs, and now possessed {{a full complement of}} materials handling machines for just about every possible configuration. In 1790, Evans moved from Newport to Wilmington and constructed a working model of his designs in the town. Evans's inventions were given a major boost when leading miller Joseph Tatnall converted his mills to the Evans system, and estimated that in one year the changes saved his operation a small fortune amounting to $37,000. Local millers quickly followed suit, and Brandywine Village was soon a showcase for Evans's milling technology. After almost a decade, the Brandywine millers were finally convinced, and within a short period automated mills began to spread across the eastern seaboard. In 1790, upon introduction of federal patent law, Evans immediately applied for protection for his milling designs and was granted the third <b>US</b> <b>patent,</b> with his application personally examined and approved by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of War Henry Knox, and Attorney-General Edmund Randolph.|$|E
