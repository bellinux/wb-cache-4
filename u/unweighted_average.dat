50|$|Calculation of {{the average}} price paid {{requires}} knowledge of the sales or shares of each competitor. A much simpler benchmark is the average price charged - the simple <b>unweighted</b> <b>average</b> price of the brands in the category. This benchmark requires knowledge only of prices. As a consequence, the price premium calculated using this benchmark is not affected by changes in unit shares. For this reason, this benchmark serves a slightly different purpose. It captures the way a brand’s price compares to prices set by its competitors, without regard to customers’ reactions to those prices. It also treats all competitors equally in the calculation of the benchmark price. Large and small competitors are weighted equally when calculating average price charged.|$|E

50|$|The summary {{measure for}} {{collective}} dismissals is attributed just 40% {{of the weight}} assigned to regular and temporary contracts. The rationale {{for this is that}} the collective dismissals indicator only reflects additional employment protection triggered by the collective nature of the dismissal. In most countries, these additional requirements are quite modest. Moreover, summary measures for collective dismissals are only available since the late 1990s. An alternative overall index, so-called Version 1, has been thus calculated as an <b>unweighted</b> <b>average</b> of the summary measures for regular and temporary contracts only. While more restrictive than the previous one (so-called Version 2), this alternative measure of the overall EPL strictness allows comparisons {{over a longer period of}} time (since the late 1980s compared with the late 1990s).|$|E

50|$|SIGI {{is based}} on a {{selection}} of indicators from the Gender, Institutions and Development (GID) Database. It specifically draws on the GID's social institutions variables that are grouped into five categories or subindices: Family Code, Physical Integrity, Civil Liberties, Son Preference (measured as the incidence of Missing women), and Ownership Rights. The index is an <b>unweighted</b> <b>average</b> of these 5 subindices and measures on a scale from 0 to 1 the level of gender inequality in social institutions (higher levels indicate greater inequality). Each term in the SIGI formula is squared to allow for partial comparison. The indicators that compose the SIGI would yield uniformly hig,h or even perfect scores for OECD member countries, given that legal discrimination against women is not present in most of these countries. However, significant gender inequality may nevertheless exist in OECD member countries; therefore, SIGI scores are only calculated for non-OECD countries to avoid misleading comparisons.|$|E

Fifteen subjects participated in the experiment. The scales were compared with the original SWAT scale in terms of sensitivity and pretask procedure completion time when performing arithmetic tasks. The results show that all four variants are more sensitive than the conventional SWAT scale and that the pairwise comparison procedure takes signi ® cantly less pretask comple-tion time comparedwith the original SWAT scale. Thus, the conventional pretask procedure can {{be replaced by a}} simple <b>unweighted</b> <b>averaging</b> to yield a scale of high sensitivity. 1...|$|R
40|$|Suppose several {{individuals}} (e. g., {{experts on}} a panel) each assign probabilities to some events. How can these individual probability assignments be aggregated {{into a single}} collective probability assignment? This article reviews several proposed solutions to this problem. We focus on three salient proposals: linear pooling (the weighted or <b>unweighted</b> linear <b>averaging</b> of probabilities), geometric pooling (the weighted or <b>unweighted</b> geometric <b>averaging</b> of probabilities), and multiplicative pooling (where probabilities are multiplied rather than averaged). We present axiomatic characterisations of each class of pooling functions (most of them classic, but one new) and argue that linear pooling can be justified "procedurally" but not "epistemically", while the other two pooling methods can be justified "epistemically". The choice between them, in turn, depends on whether the individuals' probability assignments are based on shared information or on private information. We conclude by mentioning {{a number of other}} pooling methods...|$|R

The study focuses largely on consolidated central government expenditures, which exclude public enterprises, and generally relies on <b>unweighted</b> <b>averages</b> of the individual country data. Overall, the study notes that after 1980, budget deficits rose from about 2 percent of GDP to a peak of about 6 percent in 1982. After 1982 there was a slight decline in the overall deficit, but they nevertheless averaged about 5 percent of GDP in 1988. The increase in the average deficit can be attributed largely to an increase in current expenditures, which rose from 15 percent to about 20 percent of GDP.

50|$|As of 2009, {{the average}} birth rate (unclear {{whether this is}} the {{weighted}} average rate per country each country getting a weight of 1, or the <b>unweighted</b> <b>average</b> of the entire world population) {{for the whole world}} is 19.95 per year per 1000 total population, a 0.48% decline from 2003's world birth rate of 20.43 per 1000 total population. According to the CIA - The World Factbook, the country with the highest birth rate currently is Niger at 51.26 births per 1000 people. The country with the lowest birth rate is Japan at 7.64 births per 1000 people. Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of China, is at 7.42 births per 1000 people. As compared to the 1950s, birth rate was at 36 births per 1000 in the 1950s, birth rate has declined by 16 births per 1000 people. In July, 2011, the U.S. National Institutes of Health announced that the adolescent birth rate continues to decline. Birth rates vary even within the same geographic areas. In Europe, as of July 2011, Ireland's birth rate is 16.5 per cent, which is 3.5 per cent higher than the next-ranked country, the UK. France has a birth rate of 12.8 per cent while Sweden is at 12.3 per cent. In July, 2011, the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) announced a 2.4% increase in live births in the UK in 2010 alone. This is the highest birth rate in the UK in 40 years. By contrast, the birth rate in Germany is only 8.3 per 1,000, which is so low that both the UK and France, which have significantly smaller populations, produced more births in the last year. Birth rates also vary within the same geographic area, based on different demographic groups. For example, in April 2011, the U.S. CDC announced that the birth rate for women over the age of 40 in the U.S. rose between 2007 and 2009, while it fell among every other age group during the same time span. In August 2011, Taiwan's government announced that its birth rate declined in the previous year, {{despite the fact that it}} implemented a host of approaches to encourage its citizens to have babies.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{ordinary}} <b>unweighted</b> <b>average,</b> weighted average, and maximum likelihood methods for estimating a common bioactivity from multiple parallel line bioassays. Some of these or similar methods {{are also used}} in meta-analysis. Based on a simulation study, these methods are assessed by comparing coverage probabilities of the true relative bioactivity {{and the length of}} the confidence intervals computed for these methods. The ordinary <b>unweighted</b> <b>average</b> method outperforms all statistical methods by consistently giving the best coverage probability but with somewhat wider confidence intervals. The weighted average methods give good coverage and smaller confidence intervals when combining homogeneous bioactivities. For heterogeneous bioactivities, these methods work well when a liberal significance level for testing homogeneity of bioactivities is used. The maximum likelihood methods gave good coverage when homogeneous bioactivities were considered. Overall, the preferred methods are the ordinary <b>unweighted</b> <b>average</b> and two weighted average methods that were specifically developed for bioassays.

Both problems can be handled simultaneously by acquiring images of a uniformly fluorescent, solid standard as a reference image. To measure bacter ial fluorescence, the average fluorescence intensity of isolated areas of interest (the bacteria) is computed, and corrected using the reference images. Two shading correction methods are theoretically and experimentally compared: direct averaging in the corrected image, and (weighted and <b>unweighted)</b> <b>averaging</b> using the raw image and a separate shading image to determine the weights and correct for shading during the averaging.
