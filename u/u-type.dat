5000|$|A {{more common}} {{mechanism}} {{in the formation}} of isochromosomes is through the breakage and fusion of sister chromatids, most likely occurring in early anaphase of mitosis or meiosis. A double-stranded break in the pericentric region of the chromosome is repaired when the sister chromatids, each containing a centromere, are fused together. [...] This <b>U-type</b> exchange of genetic material creates an isodicentric chromosome. Misdivision of the centromere and <b>U-type</b> exchange can occur in sister chromatids, thus creating an isochromosome with genetically identical arms. However, <b>U-type</b> exchange can also occur for homologous chromosomes which creates an isochromosome with homologous arms. This exchange between homologues is most likely due to homologous sequences containing low copy repeats. Regardless of the chromosome involved in <b>U-type</b> exchange, the acentric fragment of the chromosome is lost, thus creating a partial monosomy of genes located in that portion of the acentric chromosome.|$|E

This investigation was focused on enhancing flow uniformity and distribution of cathode air in parallel channel flow field of a fuel cell. 2 D Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations (i. e. using ANSYS) were performed to solve continuity and momentum equations across the cathode flow field. Two main designs with modified headers that provide (i) Z-type, and (ii) combination of Z and <b>U-types</b> parallel channel configurations, were investigated for uniform distribution of gases. Our presented designs were able to allow 60 - 70 % of total flow through frontal 80 % of total gas flow field area which was just reversed case compared to conventional design where nearly 80 % of flow passes through 20 % of total area at the end portion of the gas flow field. Further improvement in flow distributions was observed by segmenting the flow field...|$|R
40|$|Acrylonitrile(AN) is a neurotoxin both {{in animals}} and humans, but {{its effects on}} {{acetylcholinesterase}} (AChE) activity remain controversial. This study aimed to determine the dose-response effects of AN on AChE activity and the modulatory role of ethanol pretreatment. A total of 144 Kunming mice were randomly divided into 18 groups: nine groups received 5 % ethanol in their drinking water, and the remaining nine groups received regular tap water. One week later, both the ethanol and tap water only groups were given an intraperitoneal injection of AN at the following doses: 0 (control), 0. 156, 0. 3125, 0. 625, 1. 25, 2. 5, 5, 10 or 20 mg AN/kg body weight. AChE activity was determined on whole blood and brain 24 h later. Blood AChE activity was higher in AN-injected mice than in controls at all doses. AChE activity in blood increased in a dose-dependent manner, peaking at 0. 156 mg/kg, after which a gradual decrease ensued, displaying a β-typed dose-response relationship. In contrast, brain AChE activity, following a single AN injection, was consistently lower than in control mice, and continued to fall up to a dose of 0. 313 mg/kg, and thereafter increased gradually with higher doses. Mice receiving a 20 mg/kg dose of AN exhibited AChE brain activity indistinguishable from that of control mice, demonstrating a typical <b>U-typed</b> dose-response relationship. The activity of AChE in the blood and brain of the AN + ethanol-treated groups displayed a shift to the right, and {{the magnitude of the}} decrease in AChE activity induced by AN was attenuated relative to the AN-only group. These results suggest that AN affects AChE activity in both mouse blood and brain in a hormetic manner. Pretreatment with ethanol modifies the effect of AN on AChE, indicating that parent AN has a more prominent role than its metabolites in modulating enzyme activity...|$|R

The Federal Reserve, as a result, adjusted its mandate in believing that the inflation-unemployment tradeoff was much higher than previously thought, established a six percent target as full employment. Thus, unemployment, which had reached a peak of 9% in May 1975 did not dip below 6% until June 1978.

50|$|Turner {{syndrome}} {{is a condition}} in females {{in which there is}} partial or complete loss of one X chromosome. This causes symptoms such as growth and sexual development problems. In 15% of Turner syndrome patients, the structural abnormality is isochromosome X, which is composed of two copies of the q arm (i(Xq)). A majority of i(Xq) are created by <b>U-type</b> strand exchange. A breakage and reunion in the pericentric region of the p arm results in a dicentric isochromosome. Some of the p arm can be found in this formation of i(Xq), but a majority of the genetic material on the p arm is lost so it is considered absent. Since the p-arm of the X chromosome contains genes that are necessary for normal sexual development, Turner's syndrome patients experience phenotypic effects. Alternatively, the increase in dosage of genes on the q arm may be involved in a 10-fold increase in risk of i(Xq) Turner's patients developing autoimmune thyroiditis, a disease in which the body creates antibodies to target and destroy thyroid cells.|$|E
50|$|Neoplasia is {{uncontrolled}} cell growth, {{resulting in}} the creation of a tumour. In many different forms of neoplasia, isochromosome 17q is the most frequent neoplasia associated isochromosome and corresponds with poor patient survival. Unique DNA sequences, known as low copy repeats, occur in the pericentric region of the p arm, so a crossover event in that area can create a dicentric isochromosome through <b>U-type</b> strand exchange. The neoplasia created from i(17q) is caused by a decrease and increase in gene dosage from the monosomy of the p arm and trisomy of the q arm, respectively. Many candidate tumour suppressor genes are found on the lost p arm, allowing the tumour cell population to be maintained. It is debated whether the loss of tumour suppressor gene p53, located on 17p, is involved in the central pathogenesis of some neoplasia. The presence of one p53 gene can be functionally active, but its relation to other oncogenes can alter its expression levels when present only in one copy. Since the genetic sequences involved in i(17q) neoplasia are large, it is difficult to determine which genes, or combination of genes, are involved in tumour growth.|$|E

Of the extant textual witnesses of the Hebrew Bible, the Masoretic text is generally the most conservative in its use of matres lectionis, with the Samaritan Pentateuch and its forebearers being more full and the Qumran tradition showing the most liberal use of vowel letters. The Masoretic text mostly uses vowel letters for long vowels, showing the tendency to mark all long vowels except for word-internal /aː/.

In this case, DTT had little effect but application of MTSET restored wild-type-like <b>U-type</b> inactivation behavior, suggestive of the importance of charge at this site. Kinetic modeling suggests that the E 352 C and R 289 C inactivation phenotypes largely resulted from reductions in the rate constants for transitions from closed to inactivated states.
