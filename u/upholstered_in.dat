25|$|In its May 1971 issue, Motor Trend {{magazine}} {{published a}} comparison road test {{that included a}} Caprice Coupe and a Cadillac Sedan de Ville.

Though testers noted that the Cadillac had {{a higher level of}} quality than the Chevrolet along with a far more luxurious interior (the DeVille was <b>upholstered</b> <b>in</b> leather while the Caprice had the standard cloth trim), the magazine ultimately considered the Chevy as the better value at $5,550 compared to the Cadillac's $9,081 price mainly due to the fact the $3,500 price difference bought only a modest quality addition and a few more luxury features.|$|E
25|$|A {{chair is}} a piece of {{furniture}} with a raised surface supported by legs, commonly used to seat a single person.

25|$|Marriage did not {{diminish}} Porter's taste for extravagant luxury. The Porter {{home on the}} rue Monsieur near Les Invalides was a palatial house with platinum wallpaper and chairs <b>upholstered</b> <b>in</b> zebra skin. In 1923, Porter came into an inheritance from his grandfather, and the Porters began living in rented palaces in Venice. He once hired the entire Ballets Russes to entertain his house guests, and for a party at Ca' Rezzonico, which he rented for $4,000 a month ($ in current value), he hired 50 gondoliers to act as footmen and had a troupe of tight-rope walkers perform {{in a blaze of}} lights. In the midst of this extravagant lifestyle, Porter continued to write songs with encouragement from his wife.|$|E

Other fittings, such the 16th century carved pulpit and the medieval canons' stalls were from churches in Belgium and Germany respectively and were collected and donated by John Talbot, the 16th Earl of Shrewsbury. The sanctuary windows are the work of William Warrington. Other windows, metalwork, fittings and vestments were provided by John Hardman of Birmingham, to the design or specifications of Pugin. Hardman was a parishioner of St Chad's, founding the Cathedral Choir in 1854. Four generations of his family are among those interred in the crypt.|$|E
25|$|Federal style furniture, made by Georgetown {{craftsman}} William King, Jr., {{was added}} to the East Room by President James Monroe in 1818. (First Lady Elizabeth Monroe's involvement was limited to choosing drapery fabric for the room). King produced 24 armchairs and four sofas, all made of mahogany. The total cost was $1,408. The furniture was not upholstered, and sat along the walls largely unused. The King furniture was finally <b>upholstered</b> <b>in</b> blue damask silk in 1829 {{in the first year of}} the Jackson administration. Monroe also purchased (for $80) a marble bust of George Washington by the Italian sculptor Giuseppe Ceracchi, which remained in the East Room probably until the Kennedy redecoration in 1962 (when it was moved to the Blue Room). Monroe also purchased in 1817 for the fireplace mantels four gilt bronze candelabra, designed and manufactured by the French bronzemaker Pierre-Philippe Thomire.|$|E
5|$|Bogie {{stock was}} built by Ashbury in 1898 and by Cravens and at Neasden Works in 1900.

50|$|In {{the days}} before home air {{conditioning}} was available, it was common to put slipcovers on <b>upholstered</b> furniture <b>in</b> the hot {{months of the year}} to protect the upholstery fabric from sweat, and slipcover tailors offered clear vinyl, or plastic slipcovers.

50|$|On 11 November 1965, {{he died at}} the age of 83 years, the {{day after}} seeing a full list of patients.

25|$|On 3 June 1929 Carte {{closed the}} Savoy Theatre, and the {{interior}} was completely rebuilt to designs by Frank A. Tugwell with elaborate décor by Basil Ionides. The ceiling was painted to resemble an April sky; the walls, translucent gold on silver; the rows of stalls were all richly <b>upholstered</b> <b>in</b> different colours, and the curtain repeated the tones of the seating. Ionides said that he took the colour scheme from a bed of zinnias in Hyde Park. The entire floor space had been replanned: the old cloakrooms and bar {{at the back of}} the theatre were relocated to the side, and instead of 18 boxes there was now only one. The new auditorium had two tiers leaving three levels: stalls, dress, and upper circle. The capacity of the old house, originally 1,292, had been reduced to 986 by 1912, and the new theatre restored the capacity almost completely, with 1,200 seats. The new stage was 29.3 feet wide, by 29.5 feet deep.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of low bridges on {{almost all of}} the city routes implemented by 1927 prevented the use of double-deckers, and so attention turned to 6-wheeled single-deckers to meet the needs for extra capacity in rush hour. An batch of six such vehicles were bought from Karrier Motors, bodied by Hall, Lewis and Co. Designated the Type WL6/1, the chassis was the mandated maximum 30' length, but specially built with a longer 19' wheelbase to meet the requirement for comfortably seating 39. A 61-80hp six-cylinder engine powered single tyres on both rear axle, with air pressure braking applying on all four driving wheels. These were half-cab buses, with the driver sitting in his own compartment to the front, beside the engine. The two doors were automatically controlled by the driver. A smoking area was still in use - achieved by a division in the body, with 17 smokers sitting in the rear section. The interior featured bucket seats, <b>upholstered</b> <b>in</b> green leather, with generous leg room. Comparative trials of the six-wheelers with the shorter single-deckers on the East Road had shown that, based on a working life of 8 years, the increased revenues generated by the larger buses offset the increased capital, licensing and petrol costs. This led to eight more being ordered.|$|E
500|$|On 8 April, {{a general}} {{procession}} took {{place for the}} salvation of Arthur's soul. That night, a dirge was sung in St Paul's Cathedral and every parish church in London.

On 25 April, Arthur's body was taken to Worcester Cathedral via the River Severn, in a [...] "special wagon <b>upholstered</b> <b>in</b> black and drawn by six horses, also caparisoned in black."

During the funeral, Arthur's own arms were shown alongside those of Cadwaladr ap Gruffydd and Brutus of Troy. Two years later, a chantry was erected over Arthur's grave.|$|E
