40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} barriers to pro-social behaviour in the form of blood donating using self-determination theory. Design/methodology/approach: Respondents were recruited through intercepts at a major international university and at points within the community in a capital city in Australia. Sampling was conducted over a three-week period resulting in a sample of 617 respondents. Findings: Results show intrinsic motivations positively influence intentions towards blood donation, self-identity, and locus of control. Further, despite positively influencing other factors, external regulation positively influenced amotivation indicating the more likely people feel pressured to donate blood, the less likely they will be motivated to donate blood. Originality/value: This would suggest one way to influence more people to become donors is to place greater focus on the positive emotional feelings they derive from the act of donating blood and the control they have over that donation. Using external regulation strategy which often suggests people “must” or “have-to” donate blood may be limiting blood <b>donation</b> <b>numbers.</b> Griffith Business School, Department of MarketingNo Full Tex...|$|R

The sample consisted of 48 educational and charitable foundations, with electronic pages available on the Internet. The disclosure level was measured from the development of a survey instrument containing 100 indicators representative of mandatory and voluntary information, used for content analysis of the information in electronic pages published on the Internet. Secondly, the hypotheses were formulated, established from reviewing theoretical and empirical literature and were tested using linear regression. Econometric analysis made it possible to infer that the level of <b>donations</b> received, the <b>number</b> of beneficiaries and those supported or benefited organizations are explanatory factors for the level of disclosure on the websites published on the Internet of educational and charitable foundations of Rio Grande do Sul. In other words, the greater: the sum of amounts received as <b>donations,</b> the <b>number</b> of beneficiaries and the number of organizations supported or benefited from the educational and charitable foundations, higher will be the level of disclosure of the same...|$|R

Highlighted in the report were “a number of rare items, several in manuscripts, and various works of general reference, among which was a copy of the Palace Edition of the Imperial Dictionary issued in 1716. ” 2 The gift by Mrs. Rockhill was significant at the time and is still important now, especially for the library of the Freer Gallery of Art. The collection deserves much more coverage than it has received so far, not only for its content and quality, but also for its sheer size. We can read in the annual report that the Freer Gallery of Art library’s holdings for the year of 1928, with the addition of this <b>donation,</b> <b>numbered</b> 4, 038 volumes and 2, 578 pamphlets, 3 which means that the newl...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this study}} was to assess whether the removal of blood {{donation}} “barriers” facilitates blood donation intentions, using a sample of African migrants, and to identify the implications for social marketing. African migrants are currently under-represented as blood donors in Australia. Some members of the African community have <b>unique</b> <b>donation</b> needs that can only be served by this community. Design/methodology/approach – Interviews were conducted with 425 people from the African community in Victoria and South Australia. Factor analysis was performed on the barriers and the removal of barriers. Item groupings for both constructs differed, suggesting that barriers and their removal are not necessarily opposite constructs. Findings – The cultural society factor was negatively associated with blood donation intention (i. e. a barrier), whereas engagement and overcoming fear were positively associated with blood donation intention (i. e. facilitators). Cultural issues and lack of understanding were not seen to impede blood donation. Additionally, the removal of cultural barriers did not facilitate increases in blood donation intentions. Thus, the removal of barriers may not be sufficient on their own to encourage donation Research limitations/implications – This only examines the issue with regards to whether the removal of barriers is a facilitator of blood donation with one group of migrants, and relationships may vary across other migrant and non-migrant groups. Practical implications – Policymakers often use social marketing interventions to overcome barriers as a way of facilitating blood donation. This research suggests that removing barriers is indeed important because these barriers impede people considering becoming blood donors. However, the findings also suggest that the removal of barriers is insufficient on its own to motivate blood donations (i. e. the removal of barriers is a hygiene factor). If this is the case, social marketing campaigns need to be multifaceted, removing barriers as well as leveraging facilitators, simultaneously. Social implications – This work identified that the impact of barriers and their removal may facilitate effective social marketing campaigns in differing ways, in the context of blood donation. Originality/value – How barriers and their removal impact social marketing activities (i. e. blood donation behaviour) has generally not been explored in research...|$|R
