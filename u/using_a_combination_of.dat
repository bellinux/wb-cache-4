5|$|The band {{wanted to}} expand on the {{commercial}} success of the 1975 album Fleetwood Mac, but struggled with relationship breakups before recording started. The Rumours studio sessions were marked by hedonistic behaviour and interpersonal strife among Fleetwood Mac members; these experiences shaped the album's lyrics. Influenced by pop music, the record's tracks were recorded <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> acoustic and electric instruments.

5|$|The dating of potbelly sculptures {{has been}} {{problematic}} with {{few of the}} earlier known sculptures being found in their original context. Investigators from the 1950s through to the 1970s argued that the style was Olmec derived or perhaps pre-Olmec. Olmec culture is judged to have lasted from 1500 BC through to 400 BC based on radiocarbon dating. Investigations at Santa Leticia were focused on answering the dating problem and securely dated Santa Leticia Monuments 1 and 3 to between 500 BC and AD 100 <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> radiocarbon dating and ceramic evidence.|$|E
5|$|After {{the mixed}} {{reception}} to the 2003 film Hulk, Marvel Studios reacquired {{the rights to}} the character. Leterrier, who had expressed interest in directing Iron Man, was brought onboard and Penn began work on a loose sequel that would be much closer to the comics and the 1978 television series of the same name. In April 2007, Norton was hired to portray Banner and to rewrite Penn's screenplay in order to distance itself from the 2003 film and establish its own identity, although he would go uncredited for his writing. Filming mostly took place in Toronto, Ontario, from July to November 2007.

5|$|An {{alternative}} {{scheme was}} introduced, <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> automatic signalling and {{modifications to the}} layout at Liverpool Street. The station introduced coaling, watering, and other maintenance facilities directly at the station, as well as separate engine bays and a modified track and station layout that reduced turnaround times and increased productivity. Services began on 2 July 1920 with trains to Chingford and Enfield running every 10 minutes. The cost of the modifications was Â£80,000 compared to an estimated Â£3million for electrification. The service was officially called the Intensive Service (as it allowed a 50% increase in capacity on peak services), but became popularly known as the Jazz Service. It lasted until the General Strike of 1926, following which services generally declined.|$|E
5|$|By July 1944, Oppenheimer had {{concluded}} plutonium {{could not be}} used in a gun design, and opted for implosion. The accelerated effort on an implosion design, codenamed Fat Man, began in August 1944 when Oppenheimer implemented a sweeping reorganization of the Los Alamos laboratory to focus on implosion. Two new groups were created at Los Alamos to develop the implosion weapon, X (for explosives) Division headed by explosives expert George Kistiakowsky and G (for gadget) Division under Robert Bacher. The new design that von Neumann and T (for theoretical) Division, most notably Rudolf Peierls, had devised used explosive lenses to focus the explosion onto a spherical shape <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> both slow and fast high explosives.|$|E
5|$|Construction on the 63rd Street Line, {{including}} the Lexington Avenueâ63rd Street station, began on November 25, 1969. The station was built <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> cut-and-cover construction and tunneling machines. However, after {{the construction of}} the Second Avenue Subway ceased in 1975 due to the city's severe fiscal crisis, the BMT 63rd Street Line side, the northern tracks, basically led to a non-existent subway line, so the BMT side was abandoned and walled off with a temporary orange brick wall, and a false ceiling was placed on the upper level's IND 63rd Street Line side, the southern side. Finishing touches were only applied to the IND side of the station. The tracks on the closed-off BMT side were used only to store trains outside of rush hour.|$|E
