5000|$|The {{effects of}} a <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusion</b> depend on {{the cause of the}} injury and what part of the brain was most affected. Outcomes vary from minor {{injuries}} that require short recovery times to severe injuries that can lead to death. [...] Short-term effects of <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusions</b> can range from a mild headache to feeling lightheaded for a few days. Most short-term effects match that of a mild head injury while long-term effects can be much more serious. Most long-term injuries require surgery, rehabilitation, and close monitoring. In small cases, <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusions</b> can lead to death (about 15 per 100,000 people). If a <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusion</b> leads to a coma, recovery can be very long and rehabilitation extensive. If the coma is long, the probability of dying or permanent neurological damage is very possible.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the heat}} of a game, it may be hard to see or feel {{symptoms}} relating to <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusions.</b> If any of these signs are visible or as an athlete, you feel them, remove yourself from competition immediately. <b>Cerebral</b> <b>contusions</b> and other injuries can occur in any sport, not just in the traditional “collision” sports. According to the USCPSC, four of the top five sports that cause brain injuries are considered to have limited brain contact: basketball, bicycling, baseball, and playground activities. [...] The most popular sport to cause <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusions</b> is American football due to the drastic acceleration/deceleration of the brain.|$|R

A craniectomy was then performed around the skull fracture, the dura was opened and the sub-dural hematoma with the <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusion</b> were removed.

40|$|It {{has been}} the general policy of most neurosurgeons to {{evacuate}} the intracranial hematoma as soon as possible, and to treat the <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusion</b> conservatively without any surgical intervention. In many cases of intracranial hematoma, especially of acute subdural hematoma, <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusion</b> of considerable degree is coexistent. Even for such cases, the hematoma is evacuated through multiple burr holes which has no beneficial effect upon the underlying contusion. These attitudes {{are based on the}} concept that the already damaged structures of the brain in contusion connot be surgically repaired and that the accompanying cerebral edema and swelling is a matter of medical treatment. Recent advances in conservative management of acute head injuries with hypertonic diuresis (urea and Mannitol), hypothermia and steroids certainly decreased the mortality of severe <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusion.</b> However, as long as the total intracranial space is limited, further progress connot be expected without surgically enlarging the intracranial cavity to protect the brain stem against compression. In the past two years, our attitude has been to perform a unilateral, or bilateral if indicated, large decompressive craniotomy for severe <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusion</b> with or without hematomas. A large dural opening is covered with fascia or silicone gauze to increase the dural surface for its relaxation. Results of such treatments have been encouraging as compared to the previous methods of management...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} of delayed intracerebral haematoma formation in moderate to severely head-injured {{young adults who}} do not have signs of <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusions</b> on the initial post-trauma head CT scan has been studied. Thirty patients were reviewed and in 6 (20 %) a delayed haematoma was diagnosed on a later CT scan, when signs of <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusions</b> were absent initially.

5000|$|Rules {{exist within}} each sport {{to help prevent}} <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusions</b> and {{traumatic}} brain injuries. However, individual athletes are the best prevention against their own injuries. In a game, athletes notice when they have the symptoms of a <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusion</b> and should take themselves out of the game. It may be hard for medical personnel or coaches to notice when a player has a traumatic brain injury, so {{it is in the}} player’s best interest to be removed from play. [...] In hockey, traumatic brain injuries constitute 10%-15% of all head injuries. With the high percent of injuries being traumatic, extensive design improvements have been made to helmets. These improvements reduce the risk of <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusions</b> by providing more padding around the skull and a chin strap that keeps the helmet snug. [...] In baseball, major improvements to helmets have been made to protect batters from the impact a baseball can have when hitting their head. [...] Helmets, before this major improvement, were designed to withstand a velocity of 70 mph from a pitch or foul ball. Since the company Rawlings’ new design, helmets can withstand a velocity of 100 mph and have further padding around the softer parts {{on the side of the}} skull.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cerebral</b> <b>contusion,</b> Latin contusio cerebri, {{a form of}} {{traumatic}} brain injury, is a bruise of the brain tissue. [...] Like bruises in other tissues, <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusion</b> {{can be associated with}} multiple microhemorrhages, small blood vessel leaks into brain tissue. Contusion occurs in 20-30% of severe head injuries. A cerebral laceration is a similar injury except that, according to their respective definitions, the pia-arachnoid membranes are torn over the site of injury in laceration and are not torn in contusion. [...] The injury can cause a decline in mental function in the long term and in the emergency setting may result in brain herniation, a life-threatening condition in which parts of the brain are squeezed past parts of the skull. Thus treatment aims to prevent dangerous rises in intracranial pressure, the pressure within the skull.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A 61 -year-old male {{presented}} with a rare case of glioblastoma mimicking a <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusion</b> subsequent to collapsing. The patient had been medicated for hyperten-sion for seven years and diabetes for eight years prior to hospitalization. Brain computed tomography (CT) revealed a <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusion</b> and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in the left temporal region. The patient was initially administered intravenous drugs to reduce the intracranial pressure following the diagnosis of a <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusion.</b> Serial CT revealed ICH resorption. However, the patient was again admitted due to a headache and vomiting two months later. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated an enhanced ring-shaped mass around the cyst cavity within the left temporal region, with surrounding edema. The patient underwent cyst puncture drainage in the temporal region. No tumor cells were identi-fied in the cyst fluid and the culture was also negative. The patient was admitted for a headache and vomiting {{for the third time}} one month after being discharged. A cyst, tumor and meningoencephalitis were suspected following an MRI scan. The patient was treated with a left temporal craniotomy for a mass resection and biopsy. The histological diagnosis of the biopsy specimen was that of a glioblastoma. Two months later, MRI revealed a recurrence of the glioblastoma. In the present case, a brain tumor should have initially been suspected as the cause of the ICH, despite the history of craniocerebral trauma and hypertension. Early awareness of this potential cause of ICH may facilitate a more prompt diagnosis and treatment...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{determine}} {{the rates of}} suicide among patients {{who have had a}} traumatic brain injury.  METHODS—From a Danish population register of admissions to hospital covering the years 1979 - 93 patients were selected who had had either a concussion (n= 126 114), a cranial fracture (n= 7560), or a <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusion</b> or traumatic intracranial haemorrhage (n= 11 766). All cases of deaths {{by the end of the}} study period were identified.  RESULTS—In the three diagnostic groups there had been 750 (0. 59 %), 46 (0. 61 %), and 99 (0. 84 %) cases of suicide respectively. Standardised mortality ratios, stratified by sex and age, showed that the incidence of suicide among the three diagnostic groups was increased relative to the general population (3. 0, 2. 7, and 4. 1 respectively). In all diagnosis groups the ratios were higher for females than for males, and lower for patients injured before the age of 21 or after the age of 60. The presence of a codiagnosis relating to substance misuse was associated with increased suicide rates in all diagnosis groups. There was a tendency, among patients with <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusions</b> or traumatic intracranial haemorrhages, for suicide risk to increase with duration of stay in hospital. Cox regression analyses for proportional hazards confirmed that there was a significantly greater risk of suicide among patients with <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusions</b> or traumatic intracranial haemorrhages than among patients with concussion or cranial fractures (hazard ratios= 1. 42 and 1. 50 respectively). There was, however, no evidence of a specific risk period for suicide after injury.  CONCLUSION—The increased risk of suicide among patients who had a mild traumatic brain injury may result from concomitant risk factors such as psychiatric conditions and psychosocial disadvantage. The greater risk among the more serious cases implicates additionally the physical, psychological, and social consequences of the injuries as directly contributing to the suicides. ...|$|R
