An unsuccessful {{attempt was made to}} get a line ashore. The Captain ordered all to the four life boats, the intent being to wait <b>until</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> then make for the beach. The boats were attached by lines astern but three soon capsized in the heavy sea. A rocket was sent up and a blue light burned to show the position of the beach. Most of those thrown from the capsizing lift boats were drowned having been overcome by the cold. Had they all remained on board they would most likely have all survived.|$|E

5|$|The other port lifeboat, {{with four}} crew on board, {{was picked up}} by the steamer Leichhardt at an island at the {{entrance}} to Whitsunday Passage two days after the disaster. The steamer immediately reversed course back towards the wreck, which she reached at approximately 3.30pm on Friday, 26 February. Gothenburg was a complete wreck; the funnel was gone and she had sunk to the eyes of the lower rigging. Leichhardts Chief Officer and four hands went alongside, but nothing other than her masts could be seen above the water except for the body of a naked man floating nearby. They assumed the other victims had been taken by sharks. Leichhardt searched for survivors <b>until</b> last <b>light</b> <b>and</b> then made way for Bowen where the alarm was raised.|$|R
50|$|There are {{variations}} in the method of preparation, but generally the following method is observed. Wheat flour (and/or refined flour), salt and masala are mixed. Oil, water or milk are added and kneaded to make a soft dough. This dough is then rolled into small balls and flattened. These are then roasted over slow heat and pressed via wooden press, <b>until</b> crisp <b>and</b> <b>light</b> brown in color.|$|R

50|$|Creaming, in this sense, is the {{technique}} of softening solid fat, like shortening or butter, into a smooth mass and then blending it with other ingredients. The technique is most often used in making buttercream, cake batter or cookie dough. The dry ingredients are mixed or beaten with the softened fat <b>until</b> it becomes <b>light</b> <b>and</b> fluffy and increased in volume, due to the incorporation of tiny air bubbles. These air bubbles, locked into the semi-solid fat, remain in the final batter and expand as the item is baked, serving {{as a form of}} leavening agent. It then gives it a nice finish to the cake.|$|R

The sentry opened fire with his M60 machine-gun at [...] killing one and probably wounding two more. The surviving Viet Cong went to ground and returned fire, wounding two Australians before successfully withdrawing. 2 SAS Squadron also continued reconnaissance patrols in AO Sternum, killing one Viet Cong during a clash at 10:30. The same day in AO Moose, B and D Companies from the South Vietnamese 11th Airborne Battalion had also contacted a large Viet Cong force at 13:00, estimated to include at least two platoons armed with AK-47s <b>and</b> RPK <b>light</b> machine-guns.

Heavy fighting raged {{at the entrance to}} the Great Zab valley with most of the Turkish troops inside Iraq involved in an attack on a key PKK command centre in the valley after taking control of the PKK's Haftanin camp about 3 miles from the border. Fighting was concentrated on a strategic hill controlling the entrance to the valley. At least 21 militants were killed in the battle for the hill according to the Turkish army. The PKK used long-range guns to hold off {{the military}}, killing two Turkish soldiers, <b>until</b> silenced with <b>light</b> <b>and</b> heavy weapons fire.

40|$|Striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) were inoculated {{into the}} denervated {{abductor}} digiti quinti muscle with street rabies virus. They were killed {{at various times}} after inoculation and several tissues were examined by immunofluorescence <b>and</b> <b>light</b> microscopy. Muscle at the inoculation site was examined electron microscopically. Rabies antigen was detected in muscle fibers first on day 7 and persisted <b>until</b> day 28. <b>Light</b> <b>and</b> electron microscopic lesions at the inoculation site included atrophic and degenerating muscle fibers and a few focal and regional endomysial accumulations of macrophages, lymphocytes and plasma cells. Scattered myocytes contained bodies of matrix, virions and anomalous tubular structures on electron microscopic examination. The results indicate that replication of rabies virus may occur in infected muscle fibers at the inoculation site until 28 days after exposure. This could contribute to variations in the incubation period {{for the first two}} to three months after exposure. However, the results do not support the contention that virus is contained in striated muscle cells throughout the long incubation periods...|$|R
60|$|Once Joe {{met with}} a very great misfortune. He arrived late at a village, and finding there was good feed in the churchyard and that {{everybody}} was in bed, he put his donkeys in and stretched himself out among the gravestones to sleep. He had no nerves and no imagination; and was tired, and slept very soundly <b>until</b> it was <b>light</b> <b>and</b> time to put his neddies out before any person came by and discovered {{that he had been}} making free with the rector's grass. Glancing round he could see no donkeys, and only when he stood up he found they had not made their escape but were there all about him, lying among the gravestones, stone dead every one! He had forgotten that a churchyard was a dangerous place to put hungry animals in. They had browsed on the luxuriant yew that grew there, and this was the result.|$|R

60|$|A {{phosphorescent}} flicker played {{about the}} vague {{blackness of the}} gunboat's bows; {{the light from the}} lamp on her forestay showed part of the deck, and then receded as she rolled. Grahame could make out an anchor hanging ready to let go and a man standing by her rail, <b>until</b> the <b>light</b> reeled <b>and</b> the figure was lost in gloom. It seemed to him that the Enchantress must be seen, and he wondered whether the other vessel had her boats in the water. He suspected that she belonged to the government which Don Martin meant to overthrow, and {{it would be difficult to}} get away from her if she had steam up. She was now abreast of him, but there was no sign of activity on board. The Enchantress crept on. The gunboat dropped back to her quarter. Then there was a sudden harsh rattle, and Grahame gasped. But a splash relieved the tension, because he knew it was only the ash-hoist bringing up furnace cinders.|$|R
50|$|Weigh three eggs, and use an {{equivalent}} weight of fat, sugar, and flour. An authentic British sponge cake {{is made by}} first mixing the fat with the sugar and then by beating the eggs with the sugar-fat mix, <b>until</b> this is <b>light</b> <b>and</b> creamy, then carefully sieving and folding in the flour. Depending on the recipe, the flour may be mixed {{with a small amount}} of baking powder though some recipes use only the air incorporated into the egg mixture, relying on the denaturing of the egg proteins and the thermal expansion of the air to provide leavening. In the French version the yolks are beaten with the sugar first while the whites are beaten separately to a meringue-like foam, to be gently folded in later. The mixture is then poured into a cake tin and baked. Both methods take great care to incorporate air in the beating, whisking, and sieving stages. This makes a very light product, but it is easy to lose the air by removing the cake from the oven before it has finished cooking.|$|R

40|$|Scientific studies support common {{experience}} that light tends to allay {{the fear of}} crime at night. It is widely believed that outdoor lighting also helps prevent actual crime at night, but experiments have given equivocal results. Thorough scientific reviews published in 1977 and 1997 concluded that the effects were unknown. Recent work in the UK suggests that lighting does have a crime reducing effect by day {{as well as at}} night. This work appears to be flawed in ways that favour a crime-reducing result. While it seems reasonable to expect that social effects of outdoor lighting at night might have some influence on daytime crime, so far {{there appears to be no}} reliable evidence for any net crime-preventing effect, day or night. It even appears possible that lighting might increase crime, a topic investigated in Part 2 of this work. CCTV competes with outdoor lighting for crime-prevention funding. The available evi-dence indicates that CCTV is not an effective alternative. <b>Until</b> the <b>lighting</b> <b>and</b> crime issue is better understood, no more security lighting or other lighting for crime-prevention should be installed and the funding should be redirected to rectification of existing overbright <b>and</b> glary outdoor <b>lighting.</b> c © Copyright B.

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The {{developmental}} cytology of the elaiosome of Dicentra formosa (Andr.) Walp. {{was investigated}} {{from the time}} of initial differentiation <b>until</b> complete maturation. <b>Light</b> <b>and</b> transmission electron microscopy studies showed that the elaiosome becomes differentiated from epidermal tissue in the prefertilized ovule. At this time the cells are characterized by their large size, their irregularity in shape, and the presence of a large vacuole. As these cells continue to develop, they become larger, more irregular, and more vacuolate. The cells making up the elaiosome continue this pattern of growth throughout the entire period of seed growth becoming true giant cells at maturity. The accumulation of materials which might serve as a food source for ants was observed by staining with Sudan black and Periodic acid-Schiff's reagent during successive stages. Starch was found to be present in the cells throughout the developmental period, but not in any great amounts. Only in the mature elaiosome was a large buildup of lipid droplets observed. The massive amounts of this lipid led to the conclusion that it is the primary source of food for the ants...|$|R
