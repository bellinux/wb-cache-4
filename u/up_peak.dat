Since that time I have never consented to command a vessel that was called after two of our river young women, for I do believe {{that one of them}} is as much as a common mariner can manage. You see, Mr. Effingham, we were running along a weather-shore, as close in as we could get, to be in the eddy, when a squall struck her a-beam, and she luffed right on to the beach. No helping it. Helm hard <b>up,</b> <b>peak</b> down, head sheets to windward, and main sheet flying, but it was all too late; away she went plump ashore to windward. But for that accident, I think I might have married." ...|$|E

The storage has been installed next to a solar system. This way the solar system can be designed larger than the grid power actually permits in the first revenue model. The storage accepts a peak input of the solar system, thus avoiding the cost of a further grid expansion. The second model allows taking <b>up</b> <b>peak</b> input from the power grid and feeding it back to stabilize the grid when necessary. The third model is storing energy and feeding it into the grid at peak prices. The store received an award for top innovation.|$|E

50|$|On May 15, Du Yuming {{gave the}} order to launch a general assault on the Siping and {{declared}} to his men that the city must be taken this time. The nationalist assault came in three fronts: the 88th Division and the New 6th Army of the nationalist right front would attack the enemy’s left flank, targeting cities including Gongzhuling, Meihekou, Changchun and Qitamu (其塔木). The New 1st Army on the nationalist central front would directly attack city and then would take Shuangcheng and Dehui after taking Siping, and continue its push to the regions north of Songhua River. Two divisions of the 71st Army on the nationalist left front would attack enemy’s right flank, targeting Zheng Family’s Village (Zheng Jia Tun, 郑家屯) and Shuangcheng. On May 15, 1946, with 10 times numerical superiority and additional technical superiority, the nationalist 50th Division at the left flank of the nationalist central front launched its fierce attacks under air cover and air support on the peak # 258 held by the enemy, located {{to the east of}} Siping and south of Hafu (哈福).

The team returned in Martinsville for their 2016 debut. The number was changed from No. 62 to No. 55 with Reed Sorenson. The team made the race qualifying 40th out of 40 cars. The team would then make the races at both Texas and Bristol due to only 40 cars entered for both races, at Richmond there were 41 cars entered for the race but when qualifying was rained out and the field was set by practice speeds, the 55 team made the race due to being third fastest of the non-charter teams in practice. The 55 was driven by Michael Waltrip at Talladega; his 12th place would remain Robinson's best ever in Cup until the next restrictor plate race. Sorenson drove the next several races before being placed in the No. 98 starting at Pocono, with 98 driver Cole Whitt taking his place at this race and at Michigan, while Cody Ware drove at Sonoma; however, Ware failed to qualify. Sorenson returned at Daytona. Sorenson sat out Watkins Glen as well, with Alex Kennedy running the No. 55. The team {{has been forced to}} run many races without sponsorship; however, they did pick <b>up</b> <b>PEAK</b> Antifreeze for Talladega with Waltrip, the World Record Striper Company for Dover, the Sprint Showdown and the Coca-Cola 600 with Sorenson, long-time Robinson sponsor Vydox Plus at Pocono with Whitt, Carport Empire with Ware, and another longtime Robinson partner, Royal Teak Collection, with Sorenson at Daytona.

40|$|A {{literature}} review {{has been conducted}} on pressure drop in mini/microchannels to evaluate major discrepancies in experimental work dealing with pressure drop in these small passages. The aim of the present work is to investigate the effects of surface roughness elements on pressure drop in minichannels {{in an effort to}} determine if conventional friction factor equations are valid in predicting the friction factor in minichannels. In the present work, an experimental study is carried out to investigate the effects of surface roughness on air and water flow through rectangular channels with hydraulic diameters ranging from 325 µm to 1819 µm. Smooth surface conditions are tested over a range of Reynolds numbers from 199 to 7206. Friction factors are calculated and compared to theoretical laminar and turbulent friction factor values to validate the test section. The effect of roughness orientation is studied by using a repeated roughness feature in (i) aligned sawtooth roughness profile and (ii) offset sawtooth roughness profile on the two sides of a 10 mm wide rectangular minichannel. The roughness profile test setup consists of a rectangular minichannel, with its two sides featuring a repeating roughness profile. The aligned sawtooth roughness profile will have the roughness elements lined <b>up</b> <b>peak</b> to peak, while the offset sawtooth roughness profile will have the roughness elements lined <b>up</b> <b>peak</b> to trough. Results show that aligned peak to peak roughness yields friction factors higher than the offset peak to trough configuration...|$|E

40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{risk analysis}} (QRA) regarding dangerous goods vehicles (DGVs) running through road tunnels was set <b>up.</b> <b>Peak</b> hourly traffic volumes (VHP), percentage of heavy goods vehicles (HGVs), and failure of the emergency ventilation system were investigated {{in order to assess}} their impact on the risk level. The risk associated with an alternative route running completely in the open air and passing through a highly populated urban area was also evaluated. The results in terms of social risk, as F/N curves, show an increased risk level with an increase the VHP, the percentage of HGVs, and a failure of the emergency ventilation system. The risk curves of the tunnel investigated were found to lie both above and below those of the alternative route running in the open air {{depending on the type of}} dangerous goods transported. In particular, risk was found to be greater in the tunnel for two fire scenarios (no explosion). In contrast, the risk level for the exposed population was found to be greater for the alternative route in three possible accident scenarios associated with explosions and toxic releases. Therefore, one should be wary before stating that for the transport of dangerous products an itinerary running completely in the open air might be used if the latter passes through a populated area. The QRA may help decisionmakers both to implement additional safety measures and to understand whether to allow, forbid, or limit circulation of DGVs...|$|E
40|$|Precipitation {{is a vital}} {{element of}} an {{atmosphere}} that has direct effect on Hydrology. Therefore, an accurate estimation of precipitation is obligatory to predict runoff through the catchment. Nepal has a high spatial variability of precipitation due to highly undulating surface terrain and complex relationships between land elevation and precipitation. This requires dense rain gauge network {{for the study of}} precipitation patterns in Nepal. However, it is difficult to arrange dense setup in the mountainous topography which is expensive and sometimes, even impossible for regular maintenance. The remedy for this problem could be the use of satellite based precipitation products with high temporal and spatial resolution. In this study, TRMM data are employed to calculate rainfall over Nepal. TRMM rainfall product (that is precipitation data) can be obtained as: 3 -hourly, daily, monthly and annually. These data are extracted and compared with 264 rain gauge stations in Nepal over the period of 8 years for their validation. A number of scripts are developed with python programming language to process raw satellite data which includes clipping to the region of interest, aggregation of day, month and annual values and extraction of rainfall on the gauging stations. The day to day comparison showed that TRMM usually underestimates rainfall with some exception of overestimation at some regions. The CPOD_S value of 0. 8 depicts that TRMM can detect precipitation in most of the days. Furthermore, in monthly comparison, TRMM estimated lower rainfall values but, the result still appeared to be acceptable (R² between 1 and 0. 5) for use in other hydrological analysis. The comparison of annual precipitation as recorded by gauge and TRMM showed similar distribution patterns but the underestimation from monthly to yearly accumulate to form a huge difference in data sets. The correlation coefficient ranges from - 0. 86 to + 0. 8. The comparison of mean monthly precipitation data sets also derive same conclusion, but still possess a good R² efficiency. Though a fixed relation between altitude and intensity of rainfall could not be identified, it is observed that the efficiency of estimation decreases with increase in altitude. The reliability of point to pixel (PO-PI) comparison method is also studied. This shows a wide spatial variability even within one pixel. The trend shows increasing precipitation on higher elevation. TRMM precipitation product estimates an average value falling over the pixel. Since the comparison of monthly precipitation data showed good results, TRMM monthly precipitation data sets are also verified for use in discharge estimation from a catchment. A monthly water balance model developed by ‘Thornthwaite’ is simulated for four of the major river basins of Nepal including one sub-basin namely Karnali, Narayani, Bagmati, Saptakoshi and Sunkoshi. TRMM data without any bias correction factor is used for the estimation of discharge. The simulation results showed quiet an acceptable result although it is unable to catch <b>up</b> <b>peak</b> floods in some years. Since TRMM is underestimating rainfall in most of the conditions, it will be wise to use an appropriate correction factor. Thus, a conclusion can be drawn from this study that TRMM rainfall products can be used in catchments with less or no rain gauge data, for estimating runoffs with a generalized bias adjustment factor. </p...|$|E
