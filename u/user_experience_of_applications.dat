40|$|Testing {{criterion}} is {{a fundamental}} topic of software test-ing. A criterion is important to evaluate and drive a test-ing method. Code coverage is widely used in software test-ing, due to its simple implementation and effectiveness. Dy-namic web techniques {{have been used to}} improve the usabil-ity and <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications.</b> However, it brings some new challenges for testing. Dynamic web applications have richer iterations between client-side and server-side, such that code coverage is difficult to capture these com-plex iterations for sufficient testing. In this paper, we present a novel coverage criterion- hy-brid coverage. A hybrid coverage criterion which combines statement coverage and HTML element coverage, covers both client-side and server-side features. The experimen-tal result shows that the hybrid coverage can detect 22. 2 %- 48. 1 % more bugs than statement coverage, 7. 9 %- 57. 1 % more bugs than element coverage...|$|E
40|$|Adaptations of {{context-aware}} applications do {{not always}} result in behaviours that users expect, due to imperfect sensing of context information and variability in human preferences, etc. This can negatively impact the <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> and compromise the trust users have in them. In order to gain user acceptance it is critical for applications to support intelligibility, so {{they are capable of}} justifying their adaptive actions and explaining the decision process of adaptations to their users. Based on these intelligible explanations, users should be able to modify application settings/thresholds to correct any undesirable behaviour. This paper presents a model-based developmental framework that supports intelligibility and user control of context-aware applications. It identifies and exposes the internal middleware models which influence adaptation decisions, and facilitates generations of explanations regarding evaluations of the models. These middleware models include preference models defined using Defeasible Logic, situation abstractions specified using Hidden Markov Models and First Order Logic, and context models developed using Context Modelling Language. The framework also takes into account users 2 ̆ 7 expertise in technology when providing explanations and control to application behaviours...|$|E

In this paper, we identify the high tail latency problem in cloud CDN via analyzing a large-scale dataset collected from 783, 944 users {{in a major}} cloud CDN. We find that the data downloading latency in cloud CDN is highly variable, which may significantly degrade the <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications.</b> To address the problem, we present TailCutter, a workload scheduling framework and then formulate the Tail Latency Minimization (TLM) problem that aims at optimizing the tail latency while meeting the cost constraint given by application providers. We further design the Maximum Tail Minimization Algorithm (MTMA) working in TailCutter framework to optimally solve the TLM problem in polynomial time. We implement TailCutter across data centers of Amazon S 3 and Microsoft Azure. Our extensive evaluation using large-scale real world data traces shows that TailCutter can reduce up to 68 % 99 th percentile user-perceived latency in comparison with alternative solutions while meeting the cost constraint.

40|$|The {{increasing}} dependency {{of everyday}} life on mobile devices also increases the number and complexity of computing tasks to be supported by these devices. However, the inherent requirement of mobility restricts them from being resources rich {{both in terms of}} energy (battery capacity) and other computing resources such as processing capacity, memory and other resources. This thesis looks into cyber foraging technique of offloading computing tasks. Various experiments on android mobile devices are carried out to evaluate offloading benefits in terms of sustainability advantage, prolonging battery life and augmenting the performance of mobile devices. This thesis considers two scenarios of cyber foraging namely opportunistic offloading and competitive offloading. These results show that the offloading scenarios are important for both green computing and resource augmentation of mobile devices. A significant advantage in battery life gain and performance enhancement is obtained. Moreover, cyber foraging is proved to be efficient in minimizing energy consumption per computing tasks. The work is based on scavenger cyber foraging system. In addition, the work {{can be used as a}} basis for studying cyber foraging and other similar approaches such as mobile cloud/edge computing for internet of things devices and improving the <b>user</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> by minimizing latencies through the use of potential nearby surrogates...|$|R

We describe Chams, a middleware for constructing overlay networks that mitigates the impact of churn. Chams uses a “hybrid ” approach—it implicitly defines an overlay topology using a gossip-style mechanism, while taking the reliability of peers into account. Unlike systems for overlay construction, Chams supports a variety of topologies used in media streaming systems, such as trees, multi-trees and forests.

As an ad-dition to this, I have the following sub-questions: a) Why do people get lost even when using a mobile map application? b) What are the best practices to support navigation? c) How can we research what the important objects in the natural environment are that should be emphasized in mobile maps? d) How do we prevent the user from focusing on the map service {{at the expense of}} perceiving the location in the real environment? e) What would a good mobile map application be like concerning the usability and <b>user</b> <b>experience?</b> This thesis has four parts. In the introduction, I discuss the topic based on previous research. Second, I present the article where I studied one method of user-centric design, the eye-tracking method, and discussed its suitability for mobile map research in the wild. Third, I present articles where I compared augmented reality towards the real world in the sense of perceiving distances. Fourth, I present articles where I formulated and validated usability heuristics for evaluating mobile map applications. As result, I state that users’ location awareness may be supported by many technical and design-based solutions as well as taking user-centred design approach as part of the development process. One good method to be used in this approach is eye-tracking, which is valuable for studying users’ areas of interest while navigating and self-locating. Augmented reality is one possibility to keep users paying attention to the real world and through that, to stay aware of their location. Still, as it seems to be more difficult for the users to perceive distances when using augmented reality versus real world, special focus needs to be put on the design of presenting location information in augmented reality based maps. Other solutions to support user’s location awareness are, e. g., using multimodal interaction techniques and making use of user-generated content to make the <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> more personal and locations memorable. There are also numerous design recommendations presented in the previous research and in the usability heuristics I introduce in this thesis, and following these is needed to support users’ location awareness.

Many people have difficulties addressing their health problems because they don’t have the motivation or ability to change their attitudes and behaviours. It would be important to offer them help and tools {{so that they would}} be able to take care of themselves better and improve their well-being. All sorts of technical equipment such as PC’s, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones have become part of people’s everyday life. There is a lot of potential to use these different technical devices as a tool for providing personal wellbeing programs and applications. These include games, social media and personal health <b>applications.</b> The Aim <b>of</b> the Study: The aim of this thesis is to study if tailoring a general mobile mental wellness training application for stress management is possible and how it could be done to meet the needs of people who suffer from certain kinds of complaints. It was proposed that if the mobile mental wellness training program would be tailored to offer help for a certain complaint that a person suffers, it would improve <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> and person’s wellbeing. Methods: This research was an empirical case study. Theoretical part of this study provides a review of articles and other relevant literature. Empirical part of this study consisted of a large questionnaire conducted for the students and employees of the University of Oulu (N= 756) as well as user studies conducted for a smaller number of people (N= 30) selected based on certain criteria. The user study participants were divided into three different groups according to their complaints: tiredness, depression, and neck problems group. These three complaints were top three according to the results of the background questionnaire. The user study consisted <b>of</b> a <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> study made in laboratory settings as well as a field trial period where the participants used the application independently and their actions were logged. The users were guided to use exercises that were expected to help them with their complaints. User tests were video recorded to prevent data loss. Findings: The results showed that there weren’t big differences in <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the <b>application</b> between different complaint groups. <b>User</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the <b>application</b> was seen quite positive, but some issues made usage unpleasant, e. g. the application was mentioned being boring.

40|$|Abstract. Presented paper {{focuses on}} {{adolescent}} weblogs {{with emphasis on}} the frequency <b>of</b> lying. 120 <b>experienced</b> adolescent bloggers were contacted to fill an online questionnaire. 12 respondents were also contacted in face-to-face meetings and the presented data was verified. The results show a very low frequency of lying in weblogs. A higher tendency to lying was found in younger adolescents. Overall, respondents lied least often about age, gender and school related information, while lying most often about partnership and their family situation. Such weblogs seem to create a space for communication between a person {{and a few other}} individuals (schoolmates) and support thoughts that <b>experienced</b> <b>users</b> <b>of</b> certain <b>applications</b> on the Internet tend to use an identity corresponding with their real one. 1...|$|R
40|$|GPS {{technology}} {{has become an}} essential part of any travel and, with the development of smartphone technology, it has become accessible to a larger number of users. The development of technology over time has also enabled easier access to different information which can influence travel, and users <b>of</b> these <b>applications</b> have become more connected than ever before. All of this has resulted in one simple fact - existing GPS applications have become obsolete. For this reason, we have set the goal of developing the next generation <b>of</b> GPS <b>applications,</b> which will make significant use of a social component, as well as learning about its users’ interests in order to improve the <b>user</b> <b>experience.</b> The system is designed to use different methods of machine learning, which have to be optimized for use on mobile platforms. We have also developed a functional prototype, which has demonstrated that the existing methods can be used to improve the <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> GPS mobile <b>applications.</b> ...|$|R
