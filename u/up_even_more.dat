5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{aristocracy}} was becoming extremely rich. Several Italian towns had sided with Hannibal during the Second Punic War, and these towns were ultimately punished for their disloyalty, which opened <b>up</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> cheap farmland for the aristocrats. With {{the destruction of}} Rome's great commercial rival of Carthage, even more opportunities for profit became available. With so many new territories, tax collection (which had always been outsourced to private individuals) also became extremely profitable. While the aristocrats spent their time exploiting new opportunities for profit, Rome was conquering new civilizations in the east. These civilizations were often highly developed, and as such they opened up a world of luxury to the Romans. Up until this point, most Romans had only known a simple life, but as both wealth and eastern luxuries became available at the same time, an era of ruinous decadence followed. The sums that were spent on these luxuries had no precedent in prior Roman history. Several laws were enacted to stem this tide of decadence, but these laws had no effect, and attempts by the Censors to mitigate this decadence were equally futile.|$|E
25|$|The Mexican–American War was a {{conflict}} that sparked when the U.S. annexed Texas in 1845 and the Mexican government refused to recognize the secession of Texas which was the precursor to the annexation. The war, which began in 1846 and lasted for two years, was settled via the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo which led to Mexico giving <b>up</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> of its land to the U.S., including California. Mexico further transferred some of its territories (southern Arizona and New Mexico) to the U.S. via the Gadsden Purchase in 1854.|$|E
25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 19 August 1852, Atlantic left Buffalo, heading for Detroit, {{under the command of}} Captain J. Byron Pettey. Every cabin was full, and over 250 passengers were on the deck, many Norwegian, Irish, or other European immigrants. Atlantic stopped at Erie, Pennsylvania to pick <b>up</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> Norwegian immigrants waiting for ships to take them west to Detroit. Around half of the immigrants waiting were taken aboard; roughly seventy had to be left behind due to lack of space. Atlantic was now dangerously overcrowded, with 500-600 people aboard; the ship's clerk did not keep an exact count. Baggage was piled on the deck, and passengers stayed wherever they could, including on the uppermost hurricane deck and the roof of Atlantic cabin. At 11 pm on 19 August Atlantic left Erie. The lake was calm; the sources are unclear about the level of visibility, with reports indicating everything from a light mist to a heavy fog.|$|E

25|$|Pre-set hybrid {{triggers}} {{are similar}} to a DA/SA trigger in reverse. The first pull of the trigger is pre-set. If the striker or hammer fail to discharge the cartridge, the trigger may be pulled again and will operate as a double-action only (DAO) until the cartridge discharges or the malfunction is cleared. This allows the operator to attempt a second time to fire a cartridge after a misfire malfunction, {{as opposed to a}} single-action, in which the only thing to do if a round fails to fire is to rack the slide, clearing the round and recocking the hammer. While this can be advantageous in that many rounds will fire on being struck a second time, and it is faster to pull the trigger a second time than to cycle the action, if the round fails to fire on the second strike, the user will be forced to clear the round anyway, thus using <b>up</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> time than if they had simply done so in the first place. The Taurus PT 24/7 Pro pistol (not {{to be confused with the}} first-generation 24/7 which was a traditional pre-set) offered this feature starting in 2006. The Walther P99 Anti-Stress is another example.|$|E
500|$|Don Geiss, the {{chairman}} of General Electric (GE), challenges Jack and his rivals {{to come up with}} an idea to make money [...] "from this environmentalism trend." [...] This leads to him casting an actor called Jared to play Greenzo, NBC's environmental mascot. Initially, Greenzo is a success, making a well received appearance on The Today Show with Meredith Vieira. Eventually, he becomes more and more self-absorbed and starts insulting the TGS staff and criticizing the staff's environmentally unfriendly habits. [...] This is until he conducts a second interview, when he begins ranting negatively about [...] "big companies and their two-faced, fat cat executives," [...] referring to GE and Jack. Angered, Jack fires Jared and tries tricking Al Gore into replacing him to no avail. Also, a drunken Greenzo shows up and tries to continue only to mess things <b>up</b> <b>even</b> <b>more.</b>|$|E
500|$|Surrounding and {{stretching}} between galaxies, {{there is a}} rarefied plasma that is organized in a galactic filamentary structure. This material is called the intergalactic medium (IGM). The density of the IGM is 5–200 times the average density of the Universe. It consists mostly of ionized hydrogen; i.e. a plasma consisting of equal numbers of electrons and protons. As gas falls into the intergalactic medium from the voids, it heats up to temperatures of 105K to 107K, which is high enough so that collisions between atoms have enough energy to cause the bound electrons {{to escape from the}} hydrogen nuclei; this is why the IGM is ionized. At these temperatures, it is called the warm–hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). (Although the plasma is very hot by terrestrial standards, 105 K is often called [...] "warm" [...] in astrophysics.) Computer simulations and observations indicate that up to half of the atomic matter in the Universe might exist in this warm–hot, rarefied state. When gas falls from the filamentary structures of the WHIM into the galaxy clusters at the intersections of the cosmic filaments, it can heat <b>up</b> <b>even</b> <b>more,</b> reaching temperatures of 108K and above in the so-called intracluster medium.|$|E

2500|$|The marches {{were called}} [...] "snowball marches" [...] {{in the hope}} that like a snowball rolling down a hill will pick up more snow, gaining more mass and surface area, and picking <b>up</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> snow as it rolls along, the marchers would also collect more marchers as they progressed to the {{recruiting}} depot.|$|E
2500|$|The {{new engine}} also added weight and length at the front; though this did much for stability, {{it did not}} help the handling. [...] Because the 2600 was a {{flagship}} Alfa Romeo model, expectations were high, and both critics and customers quickly spotted the deficiencies, both on paper and on the road. [...] For example, the 165-400 radial tires fitted to the 2600 were a mere [...] wider in section than the 155-15 tires fitted to the Giulietta, though the 2600 had considerably more power and weight. [...] When the new Giulia appeared with completely new running gear, the 2600 was shown <b>up</b> <b>even</b> <b>more.</b>|$|E

[...] The Metrodome is climate controlled, and has protected the baseball schedule during the entire time it was the venue for the Minnesota Twins. Major League Baseball schedulers {{had the luxury of}} being able to count on dates played at Metrodome. Doubleheader games only occurred when purposely scheduled. The last time that happened was when the Twins scheduled a day-night doubleheader against the Kansas City Royals on August 31, 2007. The doubleheader was necessitated after an August 2 game vs. Kansas City was postponed one day after the I-35W Bridge collapse in downtown Minneapolis.|$|E

2500|$|In Spring 2008, Fallon and Felisha {{confirmed}} {{that they were}} working on a side project that didn't involve the other two members of the group. Under the name F+F, the girls began recording an album separate from Cherish. The fact {{they were working on}} solo projects made many fans speculate that the group was breaking up. In early 2009, a track by F+F called [...] "Infected" [...] was leaked online by an unknown source. This fueled the rumors of the band breaking <b>up</b> <b>even</b> <b>more.</b> After the leakage of the song, not much was heard from Cherish until 2010, when Cherish released a tribute song to Haiti called The Voices Beyond. A few weeks later, the group filmed a music video for the song [...] "Don't Let Him Get Away" [...] by Rasheeda, as the girls are featured on the track. On September 28, 2010, another track by F+F titled [...] "Lights Out" [...] was leaked online. Later in 2010, Capitol Records {{confirmed that}} Cherish would be releasing a new album, titled [...] "The Breakthrough". On October 27, 2010, Fallon & Felisha did an exclusive interview with AceShowBiz, where they were asked on the status of Cherish as a group. Fallon responded by saying [...] "Cherish is a brand and a bond that is unbreakable. We plan on having a very long career in the music industry and to definitely release more albums as a group in the near future". In mid-November 2010, music videos for both [...] "Infected" [...] and [...] "Lights Out" [...] were filmed. The music video for 'Infected' was released on February 15, 2011. No word yet if 'Lights Out' will be released, nor a confirmed album title yet.|$|E
