50|$|<b>Union</b> <b>dyeing</b> is “a {{method of}} dyeing a fabric {{containing}} {{two or more}} types of fibers or yarns to the same shade so as to achieve {{the appearance of a}} solid colored fabric”. Fabrics can be dyed using a single or multiple step process. <b>Union</b> <b>dyeing</b> is used to dye solid colored blends and combination fabrics commonly used for apparel and home furnishings.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Protein fibers are {{attractive}} topics {{in the past}} decades. Among them, soybean protein fiber, the regenerated protein-base fiber, is very popular due to its luster, smooth surface, breathability, and comfort. In order to blend with wool and reach <b>union</b> <b>dyeing,</b> soybean protein fiber was first bleached due to its yellow appearance. Various bleaching processes were introduced in this paper. Reactive dyes for cellulose and for wool, such as Unisol or Megafix dyes, together with proper dyeing process were selected and compared. The results showed that one-time oxidation bleaching is confirmed as the bleaching process due to its compromise of high whiteness and bursting strength. It is unable to reach <b>union</b> <b>dyeing</b> for soybean protein fiber/wool fiber with Unisol or Megafix dyes respectively while it is feasible to reach <b>union</b> <b>dyeing</b> of soybean protein fiber/wool fiber dyeing with Unisol dyes followed by Megafix dyes...|$|E
30|$|Current <b>union</b> <b>dyeing</b> {{processes}} rely {{on one or}} two dye baths {{with one}} or two dyes for cotton/nylon blend fabrics. For 50 : 50 cotton/nylon fabrics, cotton is dyed first under alkaline condition with reactive dyes and then the nylon is dyed with acid dyes under acidic condition. Atmospheric plasma- nano Chitosan treatment as an environmentally friendly method was employed to modify surface properties of cotton/nylon blend fabrics to develop <b>union</b> <b>dyeing</b> with acid dyes. Cellulose fibers when immersed in water produce a negative electro-kinetic potential. The negative charge on the fiber repels the anionic dye ions and consequently the exhaustion of the dye bath is limited. When the fabric is treated with chitosan, the primary hydroxyl groups of cellulose is partially modified into amide groups, which intern leads the cellulose to act like as polyamide fiber. Experimental work was carried out on finding the possibility of one bath dyeing of plasma- chitosan pretreated cotton/nylon fabric with acid dyes. Plasma treated cotton/nylon surface characteristics were evaluated using FTIR. The surface activation using air plasma introduces different functional groups in cotton/nylon blend fabric. The effect of plasma-nano chitosan pretreatment on dye ability, fastness, and few physicochemical properties has been investigated, and results are presented. The cotton/nylon sample treated with 0.3 % of chitosan nanoparticles had higher K/S values, washing, and crocking fastness. New method of <b>union</b> <b>dyeing</b> showed good fastness properties and offers the option of eco-friendly.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{described}} {{the ability to}} dye cotton/nylon blend fabric in one step, one dyeing bath with shortened time. It {{was found that the}} treatment of cotton/nylon fabrics with plasma-nano chitosan enhanced the dye uptake of cotton/nylon fabrics compared with untreated fabric. The improved dye ability of cotton to acid dye is postulated due to the presence of amine groups available from the chitosan. Based on the depth of shade values, it was found that by increasing chitosan nanoparticles concentration up to 0.3 % (w/v), there was significant improvement of color strength. Moreover, colorfastness properties to washing and wet crocking of the treated samples were improved at higher chitosan concentration. <b>Union</b> <b>dyeing</b> of cotton/nylon fabrics with acid dyes using biodegradable modification agent such as chitosan is an environmental friendly approach in textile dyeing industry.|$|E
30|$|Plasma {{treatment}} of textiles {{has been investigated}} as an alternative wet chemical fabric treatment and pre-treatment processes. It would result in desirable surface modification including {{but not limited to}} surface etching, activation, cross linking, chain scission, decrystallisation and oxidation (Kang and Sarmadi 2004; Vaananen et al. 2010; Voher et al. 1988). Glow discharge plasma of oxygen, nitrogen, ammonia etc. introduces functional groups like hydroxyl, peroxides, and amines on polymer surface. The technique of plasma treatment is an effective surface modification method to save processing costs and to avoid environmental pollution (Shahidi et al. 2007; Wakida et al. 1988). Atmospheric air plasma was used for oxidation of cotton/nylon fiber in the preparatory process with chitosan nanoparticles to produce aminised cotton/nylon fiber. The facility to attain high wet fastness standards on nylon/cellulosic blends by a one-bath technique at mildly acidic pH is a substantial advantage over the two-bath or two-stage. Meanwhile, this phenomenon gives a possibility to one-bath dyeing for blended fabrics, using aminised cotton and nylon fabric. The main objective of this research is to explore the possibilities of <b>union</b> <b>dyeing</b> of cotton/nylon fabric with acid dyes by introducing amino group in plasma treated cotton/nylon interwoven fabric using chitosan nano-particles.|$|E
40|$|Trypan blue {{injected}} intravenously {{is bound}} {{almost at once}} by the intercellular connective tissue elements all over the body,—by collagen, reticulin, and elastic fibers. This <b>union</b> of <b>dye</b> and tissue elements is the factor responsible for the early macroscopic blue color and is antecedent to cellular colloidopexic action. Different examples of connective tissue differ among themselves {{in their ability to}} hold the dye. Diffuse staining of elastic fibers noted by previous observers is merely a special case of the general affinity of connective tissue for the dye. The evidence suggests that the histiocytes are cells specialized to segregate noxae that become diffusely bound to the intercellular connective tissue matrix...|$|R
25|$|In Roman times Gythium {{remained}} a major port and it prospered {{as a member}} of the <b>Union.</b> As purple <b>dye</b> was popular in Rome, Gythium exported that as well as porphyry and rose antique marble. Evidence of the ancient Gythium prosperity can be found by the fact that the Romans built an ancient theatre which is well preserved today and is still used occasionally. The ancient theatre, as well as the city's Acropolis (west to the location of the theatre) discovered by the archeologist Dimitris Skias on 1891. Some time in the 4th century AD, Gythium was destroyed. What happened to Gythium is not recorded but it is thought to have been either sacked by Alaric and Visigoths, pillaged by the Slavs or destroyed by the massive earthquake that struck the area in 375 AD.|$|R
30|$|Day by day the {{customers}} {{are going to}} be more conscious about the quality of clothing items. As a result, it becomes more challenging for the manufacturer to maintain the consistent dyeing quality. Unlevelness is generally unaccepted in commercial dyeing, except for stone-washed, acid-washed or pigment-dyed textiles, where an effect is sought to comply with a fashion trend. Color levelness is actually a description of the uniformity of shade in different places of the fabric. Traditionally it is judged by visual assessment, or by comparing similar samples, e.g. from the same fabric batch, to determine color differences. The human eyes can detect small differences in color, but it is difficult to quantify color differences accurately. Textile manufacturing industries are mainly concerned with the appearance of color uniformity in terms of levelness parameters in <b>dyed</b> fabrics and/or <b>union</b> shade in <b>dyed</b> fabrics of more than one fiber type [13]. Since mordants are also used in the processing of vegetable dyes, unlevelness could be a major problem in textile dyeing and dyeing with the vegetable sources should have proper control over color levelness.|$|R
