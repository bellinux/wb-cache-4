It performs the conversions entirely digitally, bypassing the system sound card, enabling accurate digital conversion. For convenience, it supports the freedb database of Compact Disc track listings, to allow ripped tracks, with reduced <b>user</b> <b>effort,</b> to have the names of songs, artists and albums.

50|$|Many early small water guns {{used the}} same trigger based pumping {{mechanism}} used for spray bottles. In this type of device, the trigger actuates a positive displacement pump shaft. With the aid of two check valves, often using small balls, fluid is drawn into the pump from a reservoir, then forced out the nozzle upon squeezing the trigger. The simplicity of the spraying mechanism allowed these toys to be manufactured cheaply, and allowed {{the majority of the}} body to be used as the reservoir. The primary limitation with this design is the volume of water that can be effectively moved per pump. Increasing pump volume would require more <b>user</b> <b>effort</b> to push the fluid out, making larger designs impractical. However, this technology remains widely used today both in spray bottles as well as small water guns that {{can be found in a}} wide variety of shapes and colors.|$|E
5000|$|A {{need was}} {{experienced}} by avid 4x4 enthusiasts and overland travelers {{for a simple}} tool to effectively and efficiently remove the tire from the rim of a wheel, in cases where a tire requires repairs to the inside. On ATV's, as well as motorcycles, passenger vehicles, trucks, many industrial and offroad vehicles, as well as light aircraft have an additional feature on the rim called the Bead Retainer. The bead retainer is a bump like feature that prevents the tire bead from slipping inward on the rim and losing the air seal. On ATV's (and UTV's/side-by-sides) this bead retainer is substantially large because these tires are often run at very low air pressures (~5 psi) and experience severe side loading forces from typical trail riding. The large bead retainer is necessary to prevent unintentional dislocation of the tire bead from the bead seat. Further, if a ATV tire does lose pressure from a puncture, the large bead retainer will keep the Tire in place for low speed riding allowing the operator to navigate to the trail head without the tire coming completely off of the rim. The large bead retainers of ATV's do {{such a good job}} keeping the tire in place during operating conditions, it also prevents the tire from being easily changed with normal tools even in a shop setting.There are three categories of tire bead breaker designs: 1) [...] "Shoe and Lever mechanism", 2) [...] "Plier-type mechanism", 3) [...] "Clamp and Ram mechanism". The Shoe and Lever mechanism performs well on many motorcycle tires, passenger vehicle tires and trailers, however with more difficult-to-change tires it often fails {{because of the nature of}} the design. The shoe pushes down on the tire sidewall next to the tire bead, and if the bead is stuck, the shoe will simply slide down the sidewall. [...] Further the Shoe and Lever mechanism is quite large, and is not a good portable solution for on-the-trail tire changes. Advantages are typically low cost, often less than $50, and can be found manufactured by many companies. The Plier-Type tool has a spike that pushes in between the tire bead and lip of the rim, and can actually put a separating force on the bead bundle. However the pivot point results in a arc that quickly transitions to pushing on the sidewall. The Plier-type mechanism is more effective than the Shoe and Lever, however it has some disadvantages. It must be adjusted for different diameter wheels, it makes metal on metal contact with the rim, and can easily scratch and mar the surface of aluminum or painted wheels, it takes a bit of coordination and balance to use as you have to stand on the tire and use your body weight to operate the tool, and it is also fairly large, but ultimately is portable and is often used at race tracks for pit-stop tire changes. Ultimately, this type of bead breaker also struggles to work reliably on very stubborn ATV tires, 4x4 trucks, and tractors. The cost of the Plier-type is variable, form $75 to $200, and is manufactured by multiple companies. Lastly, the Clamp-and-Ram mechanism tool [...] is by far the most effective and compact tool for breaking beads on ATV's and other difficult-to-change tires. The only company who makes a this style of ATV Bead Breaker is BeadBuster. This style of tool has a pointed foot that enters the space between the tire bead and lip of the rim, and it uses a padded clamp that is driven with a wrench to get pulled in all the way with very little <b>user</b> <b>effort.</b> The Ram foot then gets actuated by another bolt, with little effort by the user, and it completely breaks the bead loose in one motion. Because the tool is clamped in place, it cannot slide down the sidewall and damage the tire. The ram foot pushes directly on the steel bead bundle of the tire, and therefore works well on old and deteriorated tires. The Clamp and Ram tool (aka. [...] "BeadBuster") is extremely portable and easily fits in a tool box or glove compartment, and is priced at $99 up to $200 for a professional model.|$|E

40|$|Collaboration is at {{the heart}} of {{software}} development. Virtually all software development requires collaboration among developers within and outside their project teams, to achieve a common objective. A number of classification frameworks exist that can be used to classify collaborative tools. In addition to placing the various tools in context, developers can use these kind of frameworks to select the right mix of tools for their situation. Each classification framework has a different focus: some provide a detailed taxonomy to compare tools in a particular area, some classify tools based on the functionality of the tools, some classify tools based on the high-level approach to collaboration that the tools take, and so on. However, currently no framework exists that classifies tools based on the <b>user</b> <b>effort</b> required to collaborate effectively.

State-of-the-art geomet-ric modeling tools demand extensive <b>user</b> <b>efforts</b> and artistic skills. Image-based approaches attempt to automate the modeling process but require using special acquisition systems and/or computer vi-sion techniques. In this paper, we present a new hybrid image-CAD based hairstyle modeling tool.

We then connect a web of splines as a guide hair surface and use it to compute a 3 D orientational field within the hair volume for growing hair fibers. To further refine hairstyle models, we provide a set of tools for adjusting hair fiber length and density, perturbing hair fibers, creating wisps and curls, etc. Finally, we integrate an interactive rendering engine with the modeling modules so that the user can assess the model under re-alistic shading.
