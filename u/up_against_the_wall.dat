5|$|The {{throwing}} {{became more}} intense as kick-off approached. Moments later, {{a group of}} Liverpool fans charged into section Z, causing the fans there to retreat. As they had nowhere to go, they moved towards the side perimeter wall. As more people moved <b>up</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> it collapsed, which resulted in 39 deaths and injuries to 600 people. At {{the other end of}} the ground, Juventus fans began to riot in retaliation for the events in section Z. They advanced down the pitch towards the Liverpool fans and were stopped by the police. The resulting confrontation lasted two hours and was still ongoing when the match kicked-off.|$|E
25|$|Poor {{pedestrian}} and boundary structures. The cemetery's flagstone plazas {{and sidewalks}} were crumbling due to overuse, {{and the red}} Seneca sandstone boundary wall (built in the late 1800s) around the cemetery was showing signs of severe weathering and collapse. In sections 27 and 50, earth on the Fort Myer side of the boundary walls was filled <b>up</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> This forced the boundary walls in these areas {{to serve as a}} retaining wall. Since the boundary wall was not designed for this function, the wall in these sections were cracked and leaning, and some areas in danger of collapsing completely.|$|E
25|$|With the {{completion}} of the assault ramp, Vespasian ordered a battering ram brought <b>up</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> Various stratagems were used by the defenders against the ram, including lowering sacks filled with chaff to receive its blows (until these were torn away by the Romans) and sallying forth and setting fire to the ram. Josephus also chronicles an incident in which one of the defenders, renowned for his strength, cast a huge stone on the ram from above, breaking off its head. Nevertheless, the attempts to batter down the wall continued. When Vespasian himself was wounded by a defender's dart, the Romans were so incensed that they continued their bombardment of the wall throughout the night. By morning a breach had been created and the Romans were ready to assault the walls. The besieged, however, charged through the breach, and when the Roman attempted to scale the walls, scalding oil was poured down upon them from above and they were beaten back.|$|E

500|$|The set {{was already}} being broken down {{the day after}} filming finished. Debra Messing, who plays Grace, said it was [...] "cordoned off like an {{accident}} scene. It {{was a shock to}} see parts of it gone already." [...] Each cast member was allowed to keep their favorite souvenir from the set. Messing took the door to Grace's office; she wanted to lean it <b>up</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> at her house as a piece of modern art. Sean Hayes was given a couple of pieces from Will's apartment: [...] "There's a leather box that was on Will’s desk that I want to find a place for." [...] Mullally chose a simple portrait from one of the walls, and McCormack took a small ceramic dog, though he said he would have taken everything if he could.|$|E
500|$|Ideas {{alluding}} to romance are prevalent throughout the episode. The development between Shane Walsh and Lori Grimes continues in [...] "TS-19", which showcases a flashback featuring Shane being conflicted {{with the decision}} to leave an unconscious Rick Grimes in the hospital—who Shane initially presumes to be dead. Kirkman asserted that the sequence added dimension to the storyline, and concluded that by {{the ending of the}} episode, the audience will no longer identify Shane as an antagonist. [...] "Up until the sixth episode, you get the sense that Shane actually is a bad guy, that he lied to Lori and made her believe that he was dead in order to facilitate him moving in on her," [...] said Kirkman. [...] "The flashback does a great job of telling you that that's not true: He tried to save Rick, he wanted to save Rick. He was kind of <b>up</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> there and actually did believe that Rick was dead." [...] Lincoln said of the flashback: [...] "You realize Shane's loyalty as a friend and as a man—and also his weaknesses. He still can't make a decision without his partner, and you realize he's flawed—everybody is under incredible duress, you see the state of the world is so extreme and terrifying that people are making split-second decisions under great duress. Is Shane barricading Rick in, or is he trying to prevent him being taken by the walkers? There are many different ways to construe what Shane has done and that's the beauty of the show is that there's no clear and definite answers, you make your own mind." [...] Other themes prominent in the episode include suicide and terror.|$|E

All involved in making the single took cuts in their fees or royalties so that the single sold for 5 shillings instead of the going rate of 7s d.

The Le Paradis massacre took place that day, when the 3rd SS Division Totenkopf machine-gunned 97 British and French prisoners near the La Bassée Canal.

The SS men lined them <b>up</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of a barn and shot them all; only two survived. Meanwhile, the Luftwaffe dropped bombs and leaflets on the Allied armies.

Your troops are entirely surrounded – stop fighting! Put down your arms!"

2500|$|The {{only reason}} that Angel didn't come back...it's a very simple thing.

[...] Jordan's no longer there and The WB has since recognized...I believe Garth Ancier at The WB said that it was a big mistake to cancel Angel.

Dobre, a pit brigade chief from the Paroșeni mine, later recalled Verdeț's speech (attended by some 20,000 miners), {{in which he}} stated he could not decide what measures to take but was merely there {{to find out about}} the miners' problems, which only Ceaușescu could decide to alleviate. At this point the crowd shouted, demanding Ceaușescu's personal presence, whereupon Verdeț claimed the President was occupied with [...] "urgent party and state problems" [...] and that if work resumed Verdeț would [...] "guarantee" [...] his return to the Valley within a month with a favourable reply from Ceaușescu. These promises were regarded with great suspicion by the crowd, which, emboldened, began booing again and warned that they would not go back to work until Ceaușescu personally came and publicly promised to resolve their grievances. Booed, insulted and pelted with food scraps, Verdeț and Pană hid behind Dobre and, backed <b>up</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of the gatekeeper's booth, nervously begged him to assure their safety.

These statements provoked the ire of two local associations of Koreans, the Daedong Bogukhoe and the Independence Club, who held a joint meeting in which they agreed that {{something had to be done}} about Stevens. On March 22, 1908, four Korean men chosen by the associations accosted Stevens at the Fairmont Hotel, where he was staying. Their leader, a man by the name of Earl Lee who was described as fluent in English, asked him if he had indeed made the statements attributed to him in the newspaper, and whether [...] "Japanese were not killing off the Koreans". He answered yes to the first question and no to the second, then proceeded to tell Lee that he had [...] "probably been too long away from his country to know the exact condition of the Government." [...] Upon this, the four men began to strike Stevens with chairs, knocking him down and causing him to strike his head against the marble flooring; Stevens backed <b>up</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> until help arrived.
