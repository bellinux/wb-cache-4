5|$|Outside {{the temple}} {{building}} proper was the temple enclosure, {{surrounded by a}} rectangular brick wall that symbolically protected the sacred space from outside disorder. On occasion this function was more than symbolic, especially during the last native dynasties {{in the fourth century}} BC, when the walls were fully fortified in case of Persian invasion. In late temples these walls frequently had alternating concave and convex courses of bricks, so that the top of the wall <b>undulated</b> vertically. This pattern may have been meant to evoke the mythological waters of chaos.|$|E
5|$|The VT heralded the fitment of {{semi-trailing}} arm independent {{rear suspension}} as standard across the range, a significant selling point over the rival Falcon, along with increased electronics such as Traction Control. However, in terms of suspension, the original Opel design was simplified by removing the toe control links that was standard equipment on the European Omega since 1987. Consequently, this afflicted the VT with excessive tyre wear due to distortions to the suspension camber angle and toe under heavy load, such as heavy towing or when travelling over <b>undulated</b> surfaces.|$|E

25|$|Swell {{regularity}} varies {{across the}} globe and throughout the year. During winter, heavy swells are generated in the mid-latitudes, when the North and South polar fronts shift toward the Equator. The predominantly Westerly winds generate swells that advance Eastward, so waves tend to be largest on West coasts during winter months. However, an endless train of mid-latitude cyclones cause the isobars to become <b>undulated,</b> redirecting swells at regular intervals toward the tropics.|$|E
25|$|The Bogotá savanna is a {{slightly}} <b>undulated</b> montane savanna {{in the southwestern}} part of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense, a high plateau in the Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes. The Altiplano was formed during the latest stage of Andean uplift in the Plio-Pleistocene, exposing rocks of mainly Cretaceous to Paleogene ages at surface. A small massif of Paleozoic age {{is present in the}} northern part of the Altiplano; the Floresta Massif around Floresta comprising the fossiliferous formations Floresta and Cuche.|$|E

25|$|While mosasaurs are {{traditionally}} {{thought to have}} propelled themselves through the water by lateral ungulation {{in a similar way}} to eels, the deep caudal fin of Platecarpus suggests that it swam more like a shark. The downturned caudal vertebrae of Platecarpus suggest it had a crescent-shaped tail fluke. At the point of the tail where the fluke begins the vertebral centra are shortened and disk-like. Their reduced size likely allowed for greater flexibility at an area that would have experienced high stresses during swimming. The neural spines of these vertebrae also have grooves for the insertion of interspinal ligaments and dorsal connective tissues which would have aided in lateral movement of the fluke. The ligaments were probably made of collagenous fibers that acted as springs to move the tail back into a resting position after energy was stored in them. These types of ligaments work in some living fish to conserve energy during repetitive bending of the tail. While the fluke and back of the tail <b>undulated</b> in Platecarpus, the base of the tail remained stable. This form of movement is known as carangiform locomotion.|$|E
25|$|The segment between Peterborough and Perth {{was built}} in the 1930s during the Great Depression, as a public works {{employment}} project. It was constructed parallel to a CP Rail corridor (now abandoned east of Peterborough) that {{was built in}} the 1880s, and used hand-power to dig and build the road whenever possible. From Peterborough to Norwood, the route travels in a straight line through the Peterborough Drumlin Field, connecting to the southern terminus of Highway28 and crossing the Indian River while otherwise passing through farmland. At Norwood the route suddenly begins to meander as it approaches the <b>undulated</b> Canadian Shield. The section east of Havelock to Perth, unlike the rest of the highway, travels through a relatively isolated area, with few services or residences along the route outside of the several towns that it connects. In contrast to the surroundings west of there, this section is located in dense forest with numerous lakes and muskeg dotting the landscape. It services the villages of Marmora, where it connects with the northern terminus of former Highway14, Madoc, where it intersect Highway62, Actinolite, where it meets the northern terminus of Highway37, and Kaladar, where it intersects Highway41.|$|E
25|$|Indirect {{evidence}} for endothermy {{is provided by}} the body shape of derived ichthyosaurs, which with its short tail and vertical tail fin seems optimised for a high cruising speed that can only be sustained by a high metabolism: all extant animals swimming this way are either fully warm-blooded or, like sharks and tuna, maintain a high temperature in their body core. This argument does not cover basal forms with a more eel-like body and undulating swimming movement. In 1996, Richard Cowen, while accepting endothermy for the group, presumed that ichthyosaurs would have been subject to Carrier's constraint, a limitation to reptilian respiration pointed out in 1987 by David Carrier: their <b>undulated</b> locomotion forces the air out of the lungs and thus prevents them from taking breath while moving. Cowen hypothesised that ichthyosaurs would have overcome this problem by porpoising: constantly jumping out of the water would have allowed them to take a gulp of fresh air during each jump. Other researchers have tended to assume that for at least derived ichthyosaurs Carrier's constraint did not apply, because of their stiff bodies, which seems to be confirmed by their good diving capacity, implying an effective respiration and oxygen storage system. For these species porpoising was not a necessity. Nevertheless, ichthyosaurs would have often surfaced to breathe, probably tilting their heads slightly to take in air, because of the lower position of the nostrils compared to that of dolphins.|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{atmospheric}} CO 2 can {{decrease the}} seawater pH and carbonate ions, which may adversely affect the larval survival of calcareous animals. In this study, we simulated future atmospheric CO 2 concentrations (800, 1500, 2000 and 3000 µatm) {{and examined the}} effects of ocean acidification on the embryonic and larval stage of an infaunal clam Paphia <b>undulate.</b> Significant decrease of hatching of P. <b>undulate</b> was observed when the pCO 2 reached 3000 µatm, and larval deformation rate increased significantly when pCO 2 reached 2000 µatm, indicating a strong tolerance to ocean acidification compared with the embryonic development of other bivalves. The larvae cultured in 1500 µatm pCO 2 exhibited the fastest growth, highest survival and shortened planktonic period, which unordinary phenomenon reflected the beneficial effect of ocean acidification on P. <b>undulate</b> larval development. The better development of P. <b>undulate</b> larvae under a higher CO 2 condition maybe an adaptation in response to the acidified sediment in which they live...|$|R

500|$|Spears {{performed}} [...] "3" [...] as {{the third}} song on her Las Vegas residency, [...] {{as part of the}} original setlist. After a brief talk with the audience, the singer began a performance of the song, jumping into a triangular cage which was wheeled around by her dancers across the stage. A parallel bar then dropped out of the ceiling, and Spears performed [...] choreography similar to the choreography in song's music video. For Billboards Keith Caulfield, the song [...] "served as the sexiest jungle gym in Vegas, as Spears and her dancers <b>undulated</b> their way across and around the bar". Girls' Generation member Sunny performed a cover version of the song during the Girls' Generation Tour that took place in 2011 and 2012. A studio version was also released online alongside the live version featuring on the tour album.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{terrestrial}} mammals, such as rodents, pinnipeds do {{not move}} their vibrissae over an object when examining it but instead extend their moveable whiskers and {{keep them in the}} same position. By holding their vibrissae steady, pinnipeds are able to maximize their detection ability. The vibrissae of phocids are <b>undulated</b> and wavy while otariid and walrus vibrissae are smooth. Research is ongoing to determine the function, if any, of these shapes on detection ability. The vibrissa's angle relative to the flow, not the shape, however, seems {{to be the most important}} factor. The vibrissae of some otariids grow quite long—those of the Antarctic fur seal can reach [...] Walruses have the most vibrissae, at 600–700 individual hairs. These are important for detecting their prey on the muddy sea floor. In addition to foraging, vibrissae may also play a role in navigation; spotted seals appear to use them to detect breathing holes in the ice.|$|E

500|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Mary Lambert, {{who worked with}} Madonna in her video for [...] "Borderline", was shot in Venice and partly in New York City in July 1984. Madonna was portrayed as a knowing virgin, a figment of the pornographic mind, as she walked through marble rooms, wearing a wedding gown. It alternated with scenes of a provocative-looking Madonna on board a gondola. She commented, [...] " [...] {{wanted me to be}} the modern-day, worldly-wise girl that I am. But then we wanted to go back in time and use myself as an actual virgin." [...] The video starts with Madonna boarding on a boat from the Brooklyn Bridge and travels to Venice. As she steps down into the city, she moves like a stripper and <b>undulated</b> sinuously. She wears a black dress and blue pants with a number of Christian symbol embedded jewelry around her neck. She sings the song at full volume as she watches a lion walking between the columns of the Piazza San Marco of Venice and along the statute of Saint Mark.|$|E
2500|$|A Brazilian legend {{explains}} of {{the separation}} of the red-winged tinamou and the <b>undulated</b> tinamou.

2500|$|Another {{practice}} was repeating the abbreviation's final consonant a given {{number of times}} to indicate a group of as many persons: AVG denoted [...] "Augustus", thus, AVGG denoted [...] "Augusti duo"; however, lapidaries took typographic liberties with that rule, and instead of using COSS to denote [...] "Consulibus duobus", they invented the CCSS form. Still, when occasion required referring {{to three or four}} persons, the complex doubling of the final consonant yielded to the simple plural siglum. To that effect, a vinculum (overbar) above a letter or a letter-set also was so used, becoming a universal medieval typographic usage.
