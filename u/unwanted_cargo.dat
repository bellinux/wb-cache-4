25|$|The {{economic}} boom {{spurred on by}} the California Gold Rush that had brought on {{the era of the}} clipper ships had turned to bust. All the secrets of building lofty clippers had been discovered and there were too many of them in existence. The dropping freight rates now gave no incentive to build any more. The San Francisco market was so saturated that many a disgusted ship captain dumped <b>unwanted</b> <b>cargo</b> overboard in the bay before sailing on to other ports. The diary of Robert Underhill, which recorded his 1856 travels on the Sweepstakes, revealed that Westervelt was also traveling on this voyage to San Francisco and the Orient. Underhill's entries made clear that Westervelt recognized the economic situation facing the port of New York and was seeking other possible venues for the family business.|$|E
30|$|Insulin {{is one of}} the key {{regulators}} {{for blood}} glucose homeostasis. Abnormal insulin secretion is considered an essential factor in the progression of diabetes (Weir et al. 2001). More than 99 % of insulin is secreted from the pancreatic β-cells (Rhodes 2000). Within each β-cell, insulin is stored in specified organelles known as insulin secretary granules (ISGs), and is released via a regulated secretory pathway. Insulin biogenesis initiates with the synthesis of preproinsulin in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the conversion of preproinsulin to proinsulin. Proinsulin begins to be packaged in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and is sorted into immature ISGs (iISGs). These iISGs gradually become acidic, and proinsulin undergoes proteolytic cleavage, resulting in the formation of mature bioactive insulin and C-peptide (Docherty and Hutton 1983; Orci et al. 1986; Smeekens et al. 1992; Colomer et al. 1996; Davidson 2004; Steiner et al. 2009). During this maturation process, insulin is crystallized in the form of dense core, and <b>unwanted</b> <b>cargoes</b> and membrane proteins are removed and transported either back to the TGN or endo/lysosome systems (Kim et al. 2006). The newly formed mature ISGs (mISGs) are transported to the plasma membrane to be ready for release in response to calcium stimulation (Borgonovo et al. 2006).|$|R
