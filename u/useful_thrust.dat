On the other hand, manmade ships traveling in a wavy sea store large amounts of wave {{energy in the form}} of kinetic energy for heaving, pitching, rolling and other ship motions. A natural way to extract this energy and transform it to <b>useful</b> propulsive <b>thrust</b> is by using a biomimetic wing. The aim {{of this paper is to}} show how an actively pitched biomimetic wing could achieve this goal when it performs a random heaving motion. More specifically, we consider a biomimetic wing traveling with a given translational velocity in an infinitely extended fluid and performing a random heaving motion with a given energy spectrum which corresponds to a given sea state. A formula is invented by which the instantaneous pitch angle of the wing is determined using the heaving data of the current and past time steps. Simulations are then performed for a biomimetic wing at different heave energy spectra, using an indirect Source-Doublet 3 -D-BEM, together with a time stepping algorithm capable to track the random motion of the wing. A nonlinear pressure type Kutta condition is applied at the trailing edge of the wing. With a mollifier-based filtering technique, the 3 -D unsteady rollup pattern created by the random motion of the wing is calculated without any simplifying assumptions regarding its geometry. Calculated unsteady forces, moments and useful power, show that the proposed active pitch control always results in thrust producing motions, with significant propulsive power production and considerable beneficial stabilizing action to ship motions. Calculation of the power required to set the pitch angle prove it to be a very small percentage of the useful power and thus making the practical application of the device very tractable. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{development}} of electric propulsion technology for spacecraft {{has led to}} reduced costs and longer lifespans for certain types of satellites. Because these satellites frequently undergo continuous thrust, predicting their motion and performing orbit determination on them has introduced complications for space surveillance networks. One way to improve orbit determination for these satellites is {{to make use of}} new estimation techniques. This has been accomplished by applying the Backward Smoothing Extended Kalman Filter (BSEKF) to the problem of orbit determination. The BSEKF outperforms other nonlinear filters because it treats nonlinearities in both the measurement and dynamic functions. The performance of this filter is evaluated in comparison to an existing Extended Semianalytic Kalman Filter (ESKF). The BSEKF was implemented in the R&D Goddard Trajectory Determination System (GTDS) for this thesis while the ESKF was implemented in 1981 and has been tested extensively since then. Radar and optical satellite tracking observations were simulated using an initial truth orbit and were processed by the ESKF and BSEKF to estimate satellite trajectories. The trajectory estimates from each filter were compared with the initial truth orbit and were evaluated for accuracy and convergence speed. The BSEKF provided substantial improvements in accuracy and convergence over the ESKF for the simulated test cases. Additionally, this study used the solutions offered by optimal thrust trajectory analysis to model the perturbations caused by continuous thrust. Optimal thrust trajectory analysis makes use of Optimal Control Theory and numerical optimization techniques to calculate minimum time and minimum fuel trajectories from one orbit to another. (cont.) Because satellite operators are motivated to save fuel, it was assumed that optimal thrust trajectories would be <b>useful</b> to predict <b>thrust</b> perturbed satellite motion. Software was developed to calculate the optimal trajectories and associated thrust plans. A new force model was implemented in GTDS to accept externally generated thrust plans and apply them to a given satellite trajectory. Test cases are presented to verify the correctness of the mathematics and software. Also, test cases involving a real satellite using electric propulsion were executed. These tests demonstrated that optimal thrust modeling could provide order of magnitude reductions in orbit determination errors for a satellite with low-thrust electric propulsion. by Zachary James Folcik.

5000|$|As the war progressed, {{aircraft}} designers demanded ever-increasing {{amounts of}} power.

Improvements in valve timing, ignition systems, and lightweight materials made these higher revs possible, {{and by the end}} of the war the average engine had increased from 1,200 rpm to 2,000. The rotary was not able to do the same due to the drag of the rotating cylinders through the air. For instance, if an early-war model of 1,200 rpm increased its revs to only 1,400, the drag on the cylinders increased 36%, as air drag increases with the square of velocity. At lower rpm, drag could simply be ignored, but as the rev count rose, the rotary was putting more and more power into spinning the engine, with less remaining to provide <b>useful</b> <b>thrust</b> through the propeller.One clever attempt to rescue the design, in a similar manner to Redrup's British [...] "reactionless" [...] engine concept, was made by Siemens AG.

This was achieved by the use of bevel gearing at the rear of the crankcase, resulting in the eleven-cylindered Siemens-Halske Sh.III, with less drag and less net torque. Used on several late war types, notably the Siemens-Schuckert D.IV fighter, the new engine’s low running speed, coupled with large, coarse pitched propellers that sometimes had four blades (as the SSW D.IV used), gave types powered by it outstanding rates of climb, with some examples of the late production Sh.IIIa powerplant even said to be delivering as much as 240 hp.|$|E

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{efficiency}} by which current power plants translate jet energy into <b>useful</b> <b>thrust</b> {{the use of}} turboprop and in particular open rotor aircraft are being revisited. One challenge in association with developing new powerplants for such aircraft is high speed propeller design in general and noise prediction in particular. The Boxprop was invented in 2009 by GKN Aerospace in order to mitigate {{the effects of the}} tip vortex on noise and to improve upon the aerodynamics of a conventional propeller blade. The Boxprop is composed of a double-bladed propeller joined at the tips, and the design has the potential to eliminate the tip vortex, and thereby decrease that particular noise source. The complex and highly three-dimensional shape of an advanced propeller blade is challenging to model with classical propeller design methods, requiring instead more sophisticated optimization methods. This paper presents an optimization platform developed for high speed propellers, and illustrates its use by performing a reduced aerodynamic optimization of the Boxprop. The optimization process starts by performing a Latin Hypercube Sampling of the design space, and analyzes the resulting geometries using CFD. A meta-model employing radial basis functions is then used to interpolate on the obtained CFD results, which the GA uses to find optimal candidates along the obtained Pareto front. These designs are then evaluated using CFD, and their data added to the meta-model. The process iterates until the meta-model converges. The results of this paper demonstrate the capability of the presented optimization platform, and applying it on the Boxprop has resulted in valuable design improvements and insights. The obtained designs show less blade interference, more efficiently loaded blades, and less produced swirl.

While conventional rockets are able to deliver heavy payloads, they are inefficient and lack the ability to make fine movements once in space. Inductively coupled, miniature ion thrusters are an alternative that try to address the short comings of conventional rockets. While they do not launch large payloads into space, they are much more efficient while in orbit and can maneuver more precisely. In an ion thruster, plasma is generated by ionizing gas, and ions are then accelerated out of the thruster by a series of electric grids to move the thruster forward. The grid mesh size and the position of the grids relative to each other are very important to produce the most amount of <b>useful</b> <b>thrust.</b> Finding the optimal grid configuration is best found using simulation software to find the best ion trajectory as a function of grid separation. Two different simulation packages were used to find the best grid configuration for a 15 mm long, 10 mm radius thruster that uses an argon plasma. Both systems can calculate electric fields of a geometry and can determine the charged particle trajectories. OOPIC Pro is able to factor in the effects of the plasma into the trajectory calculations, but it can only perform 2 D simulations. SIMION, on the other hand, can perform 3 D simulations, but it does not factor in the effects of the plasma. Simulations, in which the distance between the grids was varied, were performed with the two systems. The number of ions coming out parallel to the thrust axis were calculated and compared based on the grid separation. An optimum grid spacing was determined, and these results were passed on to the fabrication team to see if the experimental data matched the simulation data.

40|$|A {{state of}} the art {{turbofan}} engine has an overall efficiency of about 40 %, typically composed of a 50 % thermal and an 80 % propulsive efficiency. Previous studies have estimated that intercooling may improve fuel burn on such an engine with a 3 - 5 % reduction depending on mission length. The intercooled engine benefits stem firstly from a higher Overall Pressure Ratio (OPR) and secondly from a reduced cooling flow need. Both aspects relate to the reduced compressor exit temperature achieved by the intercooler action. A critical aspect of making the intercooler work efficiently is the use of a variable intercooler exhaust nozzle. This allows reducing the heat extracted from the core in cruise operation as well as reducing the irreversibility generated on the intercooler external surface which arises from bypass flow pressure losses. In this respect the improvements, higher OPR and lower cooling flow need, are achieved indirectly and not by directly improving the underlying thermal efficiency. This paper discusses direct methods to further improve the efficiency of intercooled turbofan engines, either by reducing irreversibility generated in the heat exchanger or by using the rejected heat from the intercooler to generate useful power to the aircraft. The performance improvements by using the nacelle wetted surface to replace the conventional intercooler surface is first estimated. The net fuel burn benefit is estimated at 1. 6 %. As a second option a fuel cooled intercooler configuration, operated during the climb phase, is evaluated providing a net fuel burn reduction of 1. 3 %.

40|$|Ionic Liquid Ion Sources (ILIS) are {{a subset}} of {{electrospray}} capable of producing bipolar beams of pure ions from ionic liquids. Ionic liquids are room temperature molten salts, characterized by negligible vapor pressures, relative high conductivities and surface tensions lower than water. Compared with the colloid form of electrospray, renowned for its applications to spectroscopy, ILIS yield highly monoenergetic beams composed entirely of ions. In this respect they are similar to Liquid Metal Ions Sources, but offer the ability to emit {{both positive and negative}} ions from a benign propellant that remains in the liquid state over a wide range of temperatures. When applied to spacecraft propulsion these sources are very power efficient and yield high specific impulses. Furthermore. the low flow rates and negligible vapor pressures of ionic liquids allow for passive feeding systems which can remain exposed to the vacuum of space. This configuration would remove the need for pressurized propellant tanks or valves, both of which are difficult to miniaturize for small satellites. However; the thrust produced from each emitter is very low, less than 0. 1 [mu]N. As a result, compact arrays of active ILIS have been sought since their discovery. If arrays of modest packing density (~ 5 emitters/mm²) could be achieved, ILIS as thrusters would offer a scalable form of propulsion capable of providing <b>useful</b> <b>thrust</b> levels to small satellites with performance comparable to established, but difficult to miniaturize, plasma based ion engines. This research has sought a technique for creating arrays of ILIS from bulk porous substrates as part of an overall process for microfabricating complete thrusters. The thesis includes a survey of potential fabrication methods considering both suitability for forming arrays of ILIS and the ability to integrate each technique within a thruster packaging process. Electrochemical etching is highly selective and can proceed at rates which are limited by mass transport conditions. In this thesis we show how this etching regime can be exploited to smoothly remove material from the surface of a bulk porous metal substrate without damaging the internal pore structure. Dry film photoresists have been identified as a suitable alternative to spin on techniques for porous materials and have been applied within an electrochemical etching process. A two step process for forming arrays of ILIS has been motivated using numerical simulations of the etching process to predict emitter profiles and investigate the impacts of non-uniform etching conditions. These concepts have been applied experimentally using a custom built, automated, etching station capable of repeatedly producing arrays of 480 emitters spaced 500 pm apart on a 1 x 1 cm porous nickel substrate pre-mounted, and aligned, within a silicon thruster package. The emitters are typically 165 [mu]m tall with rounded tips suitable for operation as ILIS. Pulsed voltage conditions were found to significantly enhance wafer level uniformity enabling fabrication of functional emitters within a few hundred [mu]m of the substrate boundary. The structures have been smoothed and rounded, making them suitable for use as ILIS, during a secondary etch process using electrolytes doped with nickel chloride to suppress transient effects. These doped solutions enabled a few [mu]m of material to be removed selectively from the porous surface while maintaining smooth features. These arrays have been mounted and aligned with electrostatic grids to demonstrate their emission capabilities. Propellant has been fed to the emitters by capillarity within the porous bulk and then extracted at potentials as low as 850 V. Beam currents exceeding several 100 [mu]A at both positive and negative polarities have been measured using both EMIIm and EMI-BF₄ ionic liquid propellant. Two complete devices were tested yielding large beam currents and very high transmission fractions (- 88 - 100 %) from both attempts. We estimate that these devices can supply 10 's of [mu]N of thrust at modest operating potentials, ~ 1. 5 kV. with a specific impulse of roughly 2000 - 3000 s. When completely packaged, the thrusters measure 1. 2 x 1. 2 x 0. 2 cm, weigh less than 1 g and require less than 0. 65 W of operating power. These characteristics would be ideal for a small satellites where volume, mass and power are all at a premium, while the thrust levels would be sufficient to enable a variety of orbit variation and attitude control maneuvers. For example, applied to a CubeSat, this type of thruster system, including PPU, would occupy roughly 10 % of the spacecraft volume and mass while enabling de-orbiting from an 800 km altitude in roughly 100 days, compared with many years when left to decay naturally. by Daniel George Courtney.
