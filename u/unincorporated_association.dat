Although the Inn was previously a disciplinary and teaching body, these functions are now shared between the four Inns, with the Bar Standards Board (a division of the General Council of the Bar) acting as a disciplinary body and the Inns of Court and Bar Educational Trust providing education. The Inn remains a collegiate self-governing, <b>unincorporated</b> <b>association</b> of its members, providing within its precincts library, dining, residential and office accommodation (chambers), along with a chapel. Members of the Bar from other Inns may use these facilities to some extent.|$|E

25|$|Up until 2013 the MCC was {{a private}} members club (and this meant that it had the status of an <b>unincorporated</b> <b>association).</b> This status had several limitations. Since an <b>unincorporated</b> <b>association</b> is not a legal entity, it could not own {{property}} (such as Lord's Cricket Ground itself) in its own name. It could not sue anybody, or indeed be sued (any legal action {{had to be taken}} against the Secretary & Chief Executive personally). In the event that a claim was successful, the committee and even the members themselves would have had to fund any financial shortfall. The club therefore called a Special General Meeting in June 2012 to consider petitioning the Queen in Council to incorporate the club by Royal Charter. The charter would remove many of the barriers and simplify the administration of the club.|$|E

25|$|SpeechNow is a nonprofit, <b>unincorporated</b> <b>association</b> {{organized}} as a section 527 entity under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The organization {{was formed by}} individuals who seek to pool their resources to make independent expenditures expressly advocating the election or defeat of federal candidates. SpeechNow planned to accept contributions only from individuals, not corporations or other sources prohibited under the Federal Election Campaign Act. On February 14, 2008, SpeechNow and several individual plaintiffs filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging {{the constitutionality of the}} Federal Election Campaign Act provisions governing political committee registration, contribution limits and disclosure. The plaintiffs contended that the Act unconstitutionally restricts their association guaranteed under the First Amendment. By requiring registration as a political committee and limiting the monetary amount that an individual may contribute to a political committee, SpeechNow and the other plaintiffs asserted that the Act unconstitutionally restricted the individuals' freedom of speech by limiting the amount that an individual can contribute to SpeechNow and thus the amount the organization may spend. SpeechNow also argued that the reporting required of political committees is unconstitutionally burdensome.|$|E
500|$|This {{has led to}} the {{development}} of the [...] "nature test". In R. v. Panel on Take-overs and Mergers, ex parte Datafin plc. (1986), In this case, the issue was whether a body discharging functions that are quasi-judicial in nature and which wields considerable de facto public powers is amenable to judicial review. The Panel on Take-overs and Mergers is an <b>unincorporated</b> <b>association</b> and does not derive its power directly from a legal source such as legislation. Rather, it is an informal body which has adopted a self-regulatory code to govern its members. However, Sir John Donaldson, the Master of the Rolls, observed that the Panel possesses [...] "immense power de facto by devising, promulgating, amending and interpreting the City Code on Take-overs and Mergers" [...] and its decisions could lead to sanctions which indirectly affect the rights of citizens. Lord Justice Timothy Lloyd acknowledged that the source test is usually decisive, but disagreed that it is the sole test to determine whether a public body is subject to judicial review. He explained that it is instead helpful to look at the nature of the power– whether the body in question exercises public law functions or if the exercise of its functions has public law consequences.|$|E

2500|$|Automatic {{resulting}} trusts {{arise from}} a [...] "gap" [...] in the equitable title of property. The equitable maxim [...] "equity abhors a vacuum" [...] is followed; {{it is against}} principle {{for a piece of}} property to have no owner. As such, the courts assign the property to somebody in a resulting trust to avoid this becoming an issue. Automatic resulting trusts occur where an express trust fails.

2500|$|Resulting trusts in English law are trusts created where {{property}} is not properly disposed of. It {{comes from the}} Latin resultare, meaning to spring back, and was defined by Megarry VC as [...] "essentially a property concept; any property that a man does not effectually dispose of remains his own". These trusts come in two forms: [...] automatic resulting trusts, and presumed resulting trusts. Automatic resulting trusts arise from a [...] "gap" [...] in the equitable title of property. The equitable maxim [...] "equity abhors a vacuum" [...] is followed: it is against principle {{for a piece of}} property to have no owner. As such, the courts assign the property to somebody in a resulting trust to avoid this becoming an issue. They occur in one of four situations: where there is no declaration of trust, where an express trust fails, where there is surplus property, or upon the dissolution of an <b>unincorporated</b> <b>association.</b> Rules differ depending on the situation and the type of original trust under dispute; failed charitable trusts, for example, have the property reapplied in a different way from other forms of trust.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} ways to evade the rules against purpose trusts. In Re Denley, land was given in trust to provide a sports ground [...] "primarily {{for the benefit of the}} {{employees}} of [...] company and secondarily for the benefit of such other persons as the trustees shall allow to use the same". Although for the benefit of a purpose, the wording identified a class of beneficiaries, which allowed the courts to find it valid. One way to evade the rule, therefore, is to create a trust that benefits a group of people but is confined to a purpose. The judgment of Lloyd LJ, given in R v District Auditor, ex parte West Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council, seems to indicate that the test of certainty for Denley trusts is the same as for discretionary trusts. A second way of evading the rules is found in Re Tyler, where money was donated to a charity, with a request to maintain the donor's family vault; if this vault was not maintained, the money would go elsewhere. Because there was no obligation to maintain the vault, it was not considered a purpose trust. The existence of the Denley exception has enabled the purpose trust to be proposed as one way of holding rights associated with an <b>unincorporated</b> <b>association.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Hovind {{established}} Creation Science Evangelism in 1989 to evangelize {{and teach}} creationism. In May 1999, his son Eric joined Creation Science Evangelism as a speaker, {{and his daughter}} Marlissa began training to become Hovind's secretary. That year, CSE merged with Faith Baptist Fellowship of Hawthorne, Florida, beginning a relationship that lasted until 2002. In 2003, {{with the aid of}} Glenn Stoll (a promoter of tax avoidance schemes), Hovind set up a series of entities starting with [...] "an <b>unincorporated</b> <b>association</b> of pure trust" [...] on May 13, under which a corporation sole and several ministerial trusts were established starting on May 23. CSE properties were conveyed to the trusts which operated under business licenses from the [...] "Kingdom of Heaven". Hovind is associated with the Unregistered Baptist Fellowship (UBF), a loosely affiliated group of roughly 100 churches which share a [...] "theology of Christian resistance" [...] to civil governments. Because the UBF would consider it an acknowledgement of government authority over the church, they reject the highly favorable 501(c)3 status, which makes donations tax deductible and exempts them from income tax, but not FICA taxes or employee income tax withholding. The UBF holds that governmental authority stops [...] "at the threshold of the church", and Hovind has likened his ministry's status to that of the Vatican City State. When the federal government obtained a search warrant in 2004, an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) criminal investigator made the sworn statement that the organization did not have a business license and did not have tax-exempt status.|$|E

2500|$|While express trusts in a family, charity, pension or {{investment}} context {{are typically}} created {{with the intention}} of benefiting people, property held by associations, particularly those which are not incorporated, was historically problematic. Often associations did not express their property to be held in any particular way and courts had theorised that it was held on trust for the members. At common law, associations such as trade unions, political parties, or local sports clubs were formed through an express or implicit contract, so long as [...] "two or more persons [...] bound together for one or more common purposes". In Leahy v Attorney-General for New South Wales Viscount Simonds in the Privy Council, advised that if property is transferred, for example by gift, to an <b>unincorporated</b> <b>association</b> it is [...] "nothing else than a gift to its members at the date of the gift as joint tenants or tenants in common." [...] He said that if property were deemed to be held on trust for future members, this could be void for violating the rule against perpetuities, because an association could last long into the future, and so the courts would generally deem current members to be the appropriate beneficiaries who would take the property on trust for one another. In the English property law concept, [...] "joint tenancy" [...] meant that people own the whole of a body of assets together, while [...] "tenancy in common" [...] meant that people could own specific fractions of the property in equity (though not law). If that was true, a consequence would have been that property was held on trust for members of an association, and those members were beneficiaries. It would have followed that when members left an association, their share could not be transferred to the other members without violating the requirement of writing in the Law of Property Act 1925 section 53(1) for the transfer of a beneficial interest: a requirement that was rarely fulfilled.|$|E
