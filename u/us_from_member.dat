As globally connected as the Internet is the technology necessary for participation is inherently local, primarily available at work, school and increasing from home.

500|$|The phrase {{became a}} common witticism used among Soviet citizens; a parable {{involved}} a call-in program on Radio Moscow where {{any question about}} their living conditions was met with the answer: [...] "In America, they lynch Negroes." [...] A U.S. citizen living in the Soviet Union in 1949 was arrested after complaining the government barred him from work; a local paper made fun of his expectation of fair treatment, writing of the U.S. as [...] "the country where they lynch Negroes." [...] In 1949 Soviet author and war poet Konstantin Simonov gave a speech at a Soviet jubilee event honoring poet Alexander Pushkin, where he delineated between the Soviet Union and the Western world by simply using the phrase to refer to English-speakers: [...] "There {{is no need for}} those who hang Negroes to commemorate Pushkin!" [...] Historian Abdurakhman Avtorkhanov wrote in his 1953 book The Reign of Stalin that Soviet media put forth the notion that U.S. citizens [...] "are unanimous in pursuing an anti-colour policy, and that the average American spends his time lynching negroes." [...] Perpetuation of the phrase during the Soviet period engendered negative feelings towards the <b>U.S.</b> <b>from</b> <b>members</b> of the working class.|$|R

[...] However, U.S. defenders argue there was such an authorization according to UN Security Council Resolution 1441. See also, United States War Crimes. The U.S. has also supported Kosovo's independence even though it is strictly written in UN Security Council Resolution 1244 that Kosovo cannot be independent and it is stated as a Serbian province. The U.S. has actively supported and pressured other countries to recognize Kosovo's independence.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{safety of}} {{mefloquine}} {{has not been}} well described in military populations. This study used standard military databases for mefloquine prescriptions and hospitalizations to investigate mefloquine safety among <b>US</b> service <b>members</b> <b>from</b> 2002 through 2004. Mefloquine-prescribed and deployed personnel (N 8, 858) were compared with two reference groups. The reference groups comprised US service members who were not prescribed mefloquine and resided in Europe or Japan (N 156, 203) or had been otherwise deployed (N 232, 381). In comparison with active-duty US service members residing in Europe or Japan, mefloquine-prescribed service members were at statistically significant decreased hazard for any-cause hospitalization, as well as diseases of the respiratory and digestive systems, musculo-skeletal system and connective tissue diseases, injuries and poisonings, ill-defined conditions, and mood disorders. These results suggest there is no association between mefloquine prescriptions and severe health effects, as measured by hospitalizations, across {{a wide range of}} outcomes...|$|R
