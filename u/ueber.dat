5|$|In 1821 Johanna Schopenhauer became {{interested}} in the work of Jan van Eyck and his followers, having seen early Netherlandish and Flemish paintings {{in the collection of the}} brothers Sulpiz and Melchior Boisserée in Heidelberg. Schopenhauer did primary archival research because there was very little historical record of the masters, apart from official legal documents. She published Johann van Eyck und seine Nachfolger in 1822, the same year Gustav Friedrich Waagen published the first modern scholarly work on early Netherlandish painting, <b>Ueber</b> Hubert van Eyck und Johann van Eyck; Waagen's work drew on Schlegel and Schopenhauer's earlier analyses. Waagen went on to become director of the Gemäldegalerie in Berlin, amassing a collection of Netherlandish art, including most of the Ghent panels, a number of van der Weyden triptychs, and a Bouts altarpiece. Subjecting the works to meticulous analysis and examination in the course of acquisition, based on distinguishing characteristics of individual artists, he established an early scholarly system of classification.|$|E

25|$|In 1802, Johann Nikolaus Forkel {{published}} <b>Ueber</b> Johann Sebastian Bachs Leben, Kunst und Kunstwerke, {{the first}} {{biography of the}} composer, which contributed to the composer becoming known to a wider public. In 1805, Abraham Mendelssohn, who had married one of Itzig's granddaughters, bought a substantial collection of Bach manuscripts that had come down from C.P.E.Bach, and donated it to the Berlin Sing-Akademie. The Sing-Akademie occasionally performed Bach's works in public concerts, for instance his first keyboard concerto, with Sara Itzig Levy at the piano.|$|E
25|$|Klein {{showed that}} the modular group moves the {{fundamental}} region of the complex plane so as to tessellate that plane. In 1879, {{he looked at the}} action of PSL(2,7), thought of as an image of the modular group, and obtained an explicit representation of a Riemann surface today called the Klein quartic. He showed that that surface was a curve in projective space, that its equation was x3y+y3z+z3x=0, and that its group of symmetries was PSL(2,7) of order 168. His <b>Ueber</b> Riemann's Theorie der algebraischen Funktionen und ihre Integrale (1882) treats complex analysis in a geometric way, connecting potential theory and conformal mappings. This work drew on notions from fluid dynamics.|$|E
25|$|Kocher first {{attained}} {{international recognition}} with his method to reset a dislocated shoulder published in 1870. The new procedure {{was much less}} painful and safer than the traditionally used procedure and could be performed by a single physician. Kocher developed the procedure through his knowledge of anatomy. In the same period, Kocher also studied the phenomena of bullet wounds {{and how they can}} cause bone fractures. From these studies resulted one public lecture in 1874 Die Verbesserung der Geschosse vom Standpunkt der Humanitaet (English: The improvement of the bullets from the standpoint of humanity.) and an 1875 manuscript <b>Ueber</b> die Sprengwirkung der modernen Kriegsgewehrgeschosse (English: Over the explosive effect of modern war rifle bullets.) He showed that small caliber bullets were less harmful and recommended to use bullets with slower speed.|$|E
50|$|According to Steinschneider (Hebr. <b>Uebers.</b> pp. 299-306), Albalag {{probably}} {{lived in}} northern Spain or southern France. Graetz {{makes him a}} native of southern Spain. His liberal views, especially his interpretations of the Biblical account of the Creation {{in accordance with the}} Aristotelian theory of the eternity of the world, stamped him {{in the eyes of many}} as a heretic.|$|R
50|$|Biul 'Iere ha-Noerim, a Hebrew {{translation}} of and commentary on Hasdai Crescas' refutation, in Spanish, {{of the chief}} dogmas of Christianity. It was written at Alcala di Henares in 1451, and published anonymously at Salonica (?) in 1860. The original work by Crescas and its title have been lost (Steinschneider, Hebr. <b>Uebers.</b> p. 462). These last two commentaries were {{in accord with the}} anti-Christian polemical spirit prevailing in the Jewish religio-philosophic literature of the time.|$|R

A merchant, Isaac Alfandari, was wrecked in 1529 on the Nubian coast (Zunz, Z. G. p. 425; Steinschneider, Hebr. <b>Uebers.</b> p. 448). In Israeli popular culture, the principal family in the 1973 film Daughters, Daughters is named Alfandari.|$|R
5000|$|Steinschneider (Hebr. <b>Uebers.</b> pp. 9-27) {{has shown}} Aldabi's Shebile Emunah to be a {{compilation}} from various older sources, chiefly from Gerson ben Solomon of Arles's encyclopedic work, Sha'ar ha-Shamayim, of the 13th century. From Gerson's work {{the chapter on}} {{the members of the}} human body (§2, chap. iii) is taken, and in part verbally. So are Aldabi's [...] "Ten Questions on the Soul" [...] (§6), interspersed with passages borrowed literally from Joseph ibn Zaddik and Hillel ben Samuel, only a modified form of the [...] "Ten Discussions on the Soul," [...] which Gerson himself adapted from a book on the soul, probably written by Ibn Gabirol.

His efforts to save the Volozhin yeshiva from being closed by the government proved unsuccessful, but his sponsorship of the institution known as [...] "Kovnoer Perushim" [...] assisted to provide a substitute. His other varied activities included participation in the Kovno kollel and membership of the Hovevei Zion movement.
