50|$|Debt {{settlement}} {{is the process}} of negotiating with creditors to reduce overall debts in exchange for a lump sum payment. A successful settlement occurs when the creditor agrees to forgive a percentage of total account balance. Normally, only <b>unsecured</b> <b>debts</b> not secured by real assets like homes or autos can be settled. <b>Unsecured</b> <b>debts</b> include medical bills and Credit card debt - not student loans, auto financing or mortgages. For the debtor, this makes obvious sense, they avoid the stigma and intrusive court-mandated controls of bankruptcy while still lowering, sometimes by more than 50%, their debt balances. Whereas, for the creditor, they regain trust that the borrower intends to pay back what he can of the loans and not file bankruptcy (in which case, the creditor risks losing all monies owed).|$|R

Officially, New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez topped {{the list of}} unsecured creditors with an estimated $24.9 million owed by the Rangers. Additionally, the Rangers also owed Baltimore Orioles pitcher Kevin Millwood $12.9 million, and current Rangers third baseman Michael Young $3.9 million.

Microsoft profits were $5.2 billion, while Apple Inc. profits were $6 billion, on revenues of $14.5 billion and $24.7 billion respectively. Microsoft's Online Services Division has been continuously loss-making since 2006 and in Q1 2011 it lost $726 million. This follows a loss of $2.5 billion for the year 2010.|$|E

50|$|Notwithstanding {{the senior}} {{status of a}} loan or other debt {{instrument}}, another debt instrument (whether senior or otherwise) may benefit from security that effectively renders that other instrument {{more likely to be}} repaid in an insolvency than <b>unsecured</b> senior <b>debt.</b> Lenders of a secured debt instrument (regardless of ranking) receive the benefit of the security for that instrument until they are repaid in full, without having to share the benefit of that security with any other lenders. If the value of the security is insufficient to repay the secured debt, the residual unpaid claim will rank according to its documentation (whether senior or otherwise), and will receive pro rata treatment with other <b>unsecured</b> <b>debts</b> of such rank.|$|R

2500|$|Because {{pension schemes}} save up {{significant}} amounts of money, which many people rely on in retirement, protection against an employer's insolvency, or dishonesty, or risks from the stock market were seen as necessary after the 1992 Robert Maxwell scandal. Defined contribution funds must be administered separately, not subject to an employer's undue influence. The Insolvency Act 1986 also requires that outstanding pension contributions are a preferential over creditors, except those with fixed security. However, defined benefit schemes are also meant to insure everyone has a stable income {{regardless of whether they}} live a shorter or longer period after retirement. The Pensions Act 2004 sections 222 to 229 require that pension schemes have a minimum [...] "statutory funding objective", with a statement of [...] "funding principles", whose compliance is periodically evaluated by actuaries, and shortfalls are made up. The Pensions Regulator is the non-departmental body which is meant to oversee these standards, and compliance with trustee duties, which cannot be excluded. However, in The Pensions Regulator v Lehman Brothers the Supreme Court concluded that if the Pensions Regulator issued a [...] "Financial Support Direction" [...] to pay up funding, and it was not paid when a company had gone insolvent, this ranked like any other <b>unsecured</b> <b>debt</b> in insolvency, and did not have priority over banks that hold floating charges. In addition, there exists a Pensions Ombudsman who may hear complaints and take informal action against employers who fall short of their statutory duties. If all else fails, the Pension Protection Fund guarantees a sum is ensured, up to a statutory maximum.|$|E
50|$|A debt {{management}} plan (DMP) is a formal agreement between a debtor and a creditor {{that addresses the}} terms of an outstanding debt. This commonly refers to a personal finance process of individuals addressing high consumer debt. Debt management plans help reduce outstanding, <b>unsecured</b> <b>debts</b> over time to help the debtor regain control of finances. The process can secure a lower overall interest rate, longer repayment terms, or an overall reduction in the debt itself.|$|R

In some cases the debtor simply cannot file under Chapter 13, as he or she lacks the disposable income necessary to fund a viable Chapter 13 plan (see below). Furthermore, Section 109(e) of Title 11, United States Code sets forth debt limits for individuals to be eligible to file under Chapter 13: <b>unsecured</b> <b>debts</b> of less than $383,175.00, and secured debts of less than $1,149,525.00.|$|R
2500|$|Paulo Portas’ {{name has}} come up in {{connection}} with questionable deals conducted by subsidiaries of Portugal’s disgraced Espírito Santo Group (ESG) that imploded in 2014 defrauding creditors, shareholders, and potentially the Portuguese banking system and Treasury. The first such instance was in 2004, when the Portuguese police intercepted {{a phone call from}} a top financial officer of Portas’ CDS-PP party to an ESG manager reminding him that [...] "we (presumably CDS-PP) put in the hands of your people (presumably ESG) more than 400 million euros in the last three weeks" [...] referring to unspecified business deals that likely included ESG's subsidiaries ESAF and ESCOM involved in, respectively, the [...] "Portucale" [...] and the [...] "submarines" [...] cases (see above). [...] Subsequently, in 2013, while he was minister of Foreign Affairs, Paulo Portas personally promoted an ill-fated luxury resort development (Herdade da Comporta) by Rioforte Investments SA, an ESG subsidiary that triggered the ESG’s group’s collapse dragging with it Portugal's telecommunication's giant Portugal Telecom that was heavily exposed to Rioforte <b>unsecured</b> <b>debt.</b> In 2015, it also emerged that in a last-ditch effort to save GES from bankruptcy, its chairman-Ricardo Salgado-had contacted Paulo Portas in 2014 in a non-successful attempt to obtain emergency financing with the support of the government in which Portas was the Deputy Prime-Minister. In a subsequent parliamentary inquiry, Paulo Portas admitted meeting with Ricardo Salgado but denied interceding on his behalf at Cabinet level or even knowing in advance of the decision to resolve Banco Espírito Santo, which had been until then the flagship of the ESG group.|$|E

For example, in the 2008 Washington Mutual Bank seizure, all assets and most (including deposits, covered bonds, and other secured debt) of Washington Mutual Bank's liabilities were assumed by JPMorgan Chase. However other <b>debt</b> claims, including <b>unsecured</b> senior <b>debt,</b> were not. By doing this, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) effectively subordinated the <b>unsecured</b> senior <b>debt</b> to depositors, thereby fully protecting depositors while also eliminating any potential deposit insurance liability to the FDIC itself. In this and similar cases, specific regulatory and oversight powers can lead to senior lenders being subordinated in potentially unexpected ways.|$|R

40|$|We {{argue that}} the 2005 {{bankruptcy}} abuse reform (BAR) contributed to the surge in subprime foreclosures that followed its passage. Before BAR, distressed mortgagors could free up income by filing bankruptcy and having their <b>unsecured</b> <b>debts</b> discharged. BAR blocks that maneuver for better-off filers {{by way of a}} means test. We identify the effects of BAR using state home equity bankruptcy exemptions; filers in low-exemption states were not very protected before BAR, so they would be less affected by the reform. Difference-in-difference regressions confirm four predictions implied by that identification strategy. Our findings add to research trying to explain the surge in subprime foreclosures and to a broader literature on household bankruptcy demand and credit supply.
