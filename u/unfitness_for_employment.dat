6000|$|... "9. Life {{imprisonment}} is {{the natural}} and humane check upon one who has proven his <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> freedom by taking life deliberately." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "'roved misbehaviour' means such misconduct, whether {{criminal}} or not, {{and whether}} or not displayed in the actual exercise of judicial functions, as, being morally wrong, demonstrates the <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> office of the judge in question." ...|$|R
5000|$|On 25 January 1988, Klehr's {{sentence}} was suspended due to <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> custody (Vollzugsuntauglichkeit). On 10 June, {{he was ordered}} to serve the remainder on probation. After seven months of freedom, he died at age 83.|$|R
6000|$|... "That didn't count; not {{the wrong}} you mean. The {{greatest}} injury {{he could have}} done me would have been in giving you to Brand. However, it was not this, but his <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> our work that made me refuse him." ...|$|R
5000|$|In November 1918, Lawson ran for {{re-election}} to the State Senate but {{was defeated by}} Democrat Charles E. Russell. The Citizens Union said that [...] "Senator Lawson has continued to demonstrate his <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> legislative office," [...] and endorsed his Democratic opponent Russell.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because it {{was based}} not only on my <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> such a marriage, but on yours. When I saw {{that there would be}} perhaps some years of misery for you, of course I {{accepted}} your decision. The sweetness had been very sweet to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [52] The {{impossibility of}} an {{absolute}} thing (substantia unica) as neither genus, species, nor individuum: {{as well as}} its utter <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> the fundamental position of a philosophic system, will be demonstrated in the critique on Spinozism in the fifth treatise of my Logosophia.|$|R
5000|$|... (a) If the District Magistrate observes in any {{police officer}} of {{or below the}} rank of Inspector marked {{incompetence}} or <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> the locality {{in which he is}} stationed, or <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> his particular duties, he may draw the attention of the Superintendent to the fact and request him to consider the advisability of transferring him to another locality or to other duties. He shall; however, bear in mind that not only are transfers detrimental to police work, but the officer transferred may do as badly or even worse in another place. Unsatisfactory work is as a rule met by punishment and a transfer should not be recommended unless it is likely to improve the criminal administration of the district as a whole.|$|R
6000|$|Lemuel came forward, full of his <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> {{the sight}} of men, but {{gathering}} a little courage when he found the dining-room so dark. He descended to the basement {{and opened the door}} of the kitchen, looked in, and shut it again. [...] "Yes, ma'am, she's there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what I'm {{trying to}} decide," [...] he replied. [...] "Sometimes I feel like renouncing myself altogether; but usually I give myself another chance. I dare say if I hadn't been so forbearing I might have agreed with your sister about my <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> the ministry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of general <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> {{the work}} he has to do. The feeling is not strong as yet, but I fear that he will teach himself {{to think that he}} has an enemy at his hearth,--not a friend. It will be the saddest mistake he ever made." ...|$|R
60|$|Christie talked, and {{the good}} soul enjoyed that far more than her dinner, for she meant to ask Mr. Power to help her find the right sort of home for the {{stranger}} whose <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> her present place was every day made more apparent to the mind of her hostess.|$|R
6000|$|Tom, in his turn, {{wished to}} make the balance dip in his favor. This hunchback must not suppose that his {{acquaintance}} with fighting stories {{put him on a}} par with an actual fighting hero, like Tom Tulliver. Philip winced under this allusion to his <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> active sports, and he answered almost peevishly,-- ...|$|R
25|$|The {{years of}} Charles's reign were {{difficult}} for Spain. The economy was stagnant, there was hunger in the land, {{and the power}} of the monarchy over the various Spanish provinces was extremely weak. Spain’s finances were perpetually in crisis. Charles's <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> rule meant he was often ignored, and power during his reign became the subject of court intrigues and foreign influence, particularly French and Austrian.|$|R
50|$|The term half-caste was {{not merely}} a term of legal convenience. It became a term of common {{cultural}} discourse and appeared even in religious records. For example, John Harper notes. from records of Woolmington Christian mission, that half-castes and anyone with any aborigine connection were considered 'degraded as to divine things, almost on a level with a brute, {{in a state of}} moral <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> heaven'.|$|R

5000|$|Mustard gas was {{a source}} of extreme dread. In The Anatomy of Courage (1945), Lord Moran, who had been a medical officer during the war, wrote: After July 1917 gas partly usurped the role of high {{explosive}} in bringing to head a natural <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> war. The gassed men were an expression of trench fatigue, a menace when the manhood of the nation had been picked over.|$|R
5000|$|... 2. The confederated governments {{mutually}} pledge {{themselves to}} {{remove from the}} universities or other public educational institutions all teachers who, by obvious deviation from their duty, or by exceeding {{the limits of their}} functions, or by the abuse of their legitimate influence over the youthful minds, or by propagating harmful doctrines hostile to public order or subversive of existing governmental institutions, shall have unmistakably proved their <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> the important office entrusted to them.|$|R
60|$|Isabella groaned aloud, {{and walked}} to a distant part of the chapel, while Mercedes burst into tears, and sinking on her knees, she {{buried her face in}} the cloth of the couch, and prayed fervently for the enlightening of the soul of the princess. The churchman did not receive this proof of ignorance in his penitent, and of her <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> the rite he had just administered, with the same pity and indulgence.|$|R
6000|$|I {{wonder that}} any man, {{who could not}} but be {{conscious}} of his own <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> it, should go to amuse the learned world with such an undertaking! A man ought to value his reputation more than money; and not to hope that those who can read for themselves will be imposed upon, merely by a partially and unseasonably celebrated name.[474] Poetis quidlibei audendi shall be Mr Dryden's motto, though it should extend to picking of pockets.[475] ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs Hurtle {{promised that}} she would speak to Ruby, though when making the promise she could not but think of her <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> the task. She knew nothing of the country. She had not a single friend in it, but Paul Montague;--and she had run after him with as little {{discretion}} as Ruby Ruggles was showing in running after her lover. Who was she that she should take upon herself to give advice to any female? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have got}} rid, at any rate, of one terrible bother. I daresay we shall drop it before long in England. I don't {{see why we}} should {{continue}} to sit merely to register the edicts of the House of Commons, and be told that we're a pack of fools when we hesitate." [...] I {{told him that it}} was the unfortunate destiny of a House of Lords to be made to see her own <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> legislative work.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I, madam? angry?’ he cried. ‘You rave! I have {{no cause}} for anger. In every way I have been taught my weakness, my instability, and my <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> the world. I am a plexus of weaknesses, an {{impotent}} Prince, a doubtful gentleman; and you yourself, indulgent as you are, have twice reproved my levity. And shall I be angry? I may feel the unkindness, but I have sufficient honesty of mind to see the reasons of this coup d’état.’ ...|$|R
50|$|During the cess controversy, {{where the}} landowners of the Pale {{objected to the}} {{taxation}} reforms proposed by the Lord Deputy, Sir Henry Sidney, Plunket was almost alone in supporting Sidney, and earned his gratitude as a result (although Sidney privately admitted that {{he was concerned about}} Plunket's fitness for office, in view of his age and failing health). Successive administrations praised Plunket's diligence and incorruptibility; only from about 1577 on were public complaints made of his <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> office.|$|R
60|$|I cannot {{entangle}} {{the reader}} in the intricacy of the inquiries necessary for {{anything like a}} satisfactory solution of these questions. But, were he to engage in such inquiries, their result would be his strong conviction of the earth's having been brought from a state {{in which it was}} utterly uninhabitable into one fitted for man;--of its having been, when first inhabitable, more beautiful than it is now; and of its gradually tending to still greater inferiority of aspect, and <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> abode.|$|R

2500|$|In December 1854 (after George Grey had {{completed}} {{his first term}} as Governor of New Zealand) the central Government finally agreed to the removal of Campbell from office. The grounds for his removal were [...] "general <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> the duties of his office, willful and continued neglect of duty and a determined spirit of opposition and resistance to the Provincial Government, and disrespect towards its executive officers." [...] Superintendent James FitzGerald appointed lawyer and court registrar Christopher Alderson Calvert as Registrar of Deeds in place of Campbell.|$|R
60|$|And now {{followed}} the piquant days {{to which his}} position as her architect, or, at worst, {{as one of her}} two architects, naturally led. His anticipations were for once surpassed by the reality. Perhaps Somerset's inherent <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> a professional life under ordinary circumstances was only proved by his great zest for it now. Had he been in regular practice, with numerous other clients, instead of having merely made a start with this one, he would have totally neglected their business in his exclusive attention to Paula's.|$|R
50|$|Boyd Shreave: a {{telemarketer}} {{employed by}} Relentless, Inc. Boyd {{is a typical}} Hiaasen bad guy: obnoxious, arrogant, totally self-absorbed and oblivious to both nature and his own shortcomings. He has been in sales for his entire adult life, partly out of laziness, partly out of general <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> any other career, and partly based on an unshakeable conviction (reinforced through countless hours of daytime television) that he is superior {{to the rest of}} humanity, and that somewhere out there is a market for him, crammed with suckers.|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of time lost from {{work as a}} result of absenteeism is classified as due to sickness although only a small proportion of the total can be regarded {{as a result of}} <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> work for medical reasons. An occupational health service assists a business in minimizing absenteeism by promoting an early return to work, assists general practitioners and hospital specialists in tailoring return to work packages, and assists employees by liaising with both management and their medical specialists to facilitate a return to normal work...|$|R

5000|$|An adopted son of his {{successor}} took {{the name of}} Zalim Singh in 1875 on becoming chief of Jhalawar. He was a minor and was not invested with governing powers till 1884. Owing to his maladministration, his relations with the British government became strained, and he was finally deposed in 1896, [...] "on account of persistent misgovernment and proved <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> the powers of a ruling chief." [...] He went to live at Varanasi, on a pension of Rs.2,000/- and the administration {{was placed in the}} hands of the British resident.|$|R
5000|$|Her {{frustration}} {{eventually was}} pointed to as typifying women's <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> supervising construction, although many architects sympathized with her position and defended her. In {{the end the}} rifts were made up, perhaps, and Hayden's building received an award for [...] "Delicacy of style, artistic taste, and geniality and elegance of the interior." [...] Within a year or two, virtually all the Fair buildings were destroyed. Frustrated with {{the way she had}} been treated, Hayden {{may or may not have}} decided to retire from architecture, but she did not work again as an architect.|$|R
5000|$|The {{court may}} also remove a {{liquidator}} and appoint another {{if there is}} [...] "cause shown" [...] by the applicant for his removal. It is not normally necessary to demonstrate personal misconduct or <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> this purpose. However, it will be enough if the liquidator fails to display sufficient vigour in the discharge of his duties, for instance, by not establishing the current assets and recent trading of the company or in not attempting to secure favourable terms for the company {{in relation to the}} disposal of its assets.|$|R
5|$|By mid-1944, the M3 {{had fallen}} out of favor even with {{airborne}} troops, despite their strong preference for compact and lightweight weapon systems. The Airborne Command had rejected the 57mm M1 in the summer of 1943 claiming its <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> airlifting and the Table of Organisation and Equipment (TO) of February 1944 still had airborne divisions keeping their 37mm guns. Nevertheless, the 82nd and the 101st, were reequipped with British-manufactured 6-pounder gun (57mm) on carriage Mk III (designed to fit into the British Horsa glider) for the Normandy airdrops. This change was officially introduced in the TO of December 1944.|$|R
