40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to explore approaches to create unique identities by the de-duplication process using multi-modal biometrics. Various government sectors in the world provide different services and welfare schemes for the beneffit {{of the people in}} the society using an identity number. A unique identity (<b>UID)</b> <b>number</b> assigned for every person would obviate the need for a person to produce multiple documentary proofs of his/her identity for availing any government/private services. In the process of creating unique identity of a person, there is a possibility of duplicate identities as the same person might want to get multiple identities in order to get extra beneffits from the Government. These duplicate identities can be eliminated by the de-duplication process using multi-modal biometrics, namely, iris, ngerprint, face and signature. De-duplication is the process of removing instances of multiple enrollments of the same person using the person's biometric data. As the number of people enrolledinto the biometric system runs into billions, the time complexity increases in the de duplication process. In this thesis, three different case studies are presented to address the performance issues of de-duplication process in order to create unique identity of a person...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} a detailed overview ofthe analytic methods for calculating the beam and gaseous thermal conductance components associated with uncooled VOx microbolometers. The conventional method {{to calculate the}} gaseous component relies {{on the assumption that}} the entire plate is maintained at a uniform temperature,thus the surface area ofthe plate is used for the calculation. We have observed using an industry leading multiphysics simulator thatthis assumption is not strictly true for VOx microbolometers as the conduction pattern exhibits an elliptical shape. Based on this, we have developed and propose an analyticmethod that employs anelliptical surface area scaledappropriately withthedevice dimensions to obtain an estimate ofthe average temperature conduction pattern. Prototype devices were manufactured and experimentally characterised. The devices exhibit thermal conduction characteristics comparable to those in literature and industry, and we could achieve 0. 5 W/K under vacuum conditions and 15 W/K at atmospheric pressure with a TCR of − 1 %/K. However, both simulated and experimental result sets of the gaseous thermal conductance exhibit large deviations from the conventional analytic method, on average approximately 40 %. The proposed method reduces this average error significantly to less than 10 % when compared to the simulated results.

The most important parameters controlling the atmospheric circulation are the rotation angular velocity and the energy balance between the internal heat source and the star's insolation. The rst parameter can be reasonably constrained for some of these objects by theoretical arguments. The second is constrained by the observations. Assuming a hydrogen composition, we discuss possible scenarios for the rst order atmospheric motions in terms of characteristic geophysical <b>uid</b> dynamic <b>numbers</b> and representative time constants.

The challenge of this approach is getting the information needed for the determination during this phase (a detailed description is given in Section 4) [1]. One issue, which is not covered by this approach, is the changing physical relation factor during communication.

This is even more so for species employing multiple sexual strategies, which is a surprisingly common occurrence. While heterothallism is relatively well understood in terms of its physiological and molecular underpinnings, homothallism remains greatly understudied.

The Mgi and Sei defect introduced transition state levels that had either donor or acceptor levels within the band gap.

Diagnosis of rabies in humans is complicated, and diagnosis in the animal vector can provide circumstantial evidence to support clinical diagnosis of rabies in humans.

40|$|Current–voltage, capacitance–voltage and {{conventional}} deep level transient spectroscopy at temperature ranges from 40 to 300 K have been employed {{to study the}} influence of alpha-particle irradiation from an 241 Am source on Ni/ 4 H–SiC Schottky contacts. The nickel Schottky barrier diodes were resistively evaporated on n-type 4 H–SiC samples of doping density of 7. 1 1015 cm 3. It was observed that radiation damage caused an increase in ideality factors of the samples from 1. 04 to 1. 07, an increase in Schottky barrier height from 1. 25 to 1. 31 eV, an increase in series resistance from 48 to 270 X but a decrease in saturation current density from 55 to 9 10 12 Am 2 from I–V plots at 300 K. The free carrier concentration of the sample decreased slightly after irradiation. Conventional DLTS showed peaks due to four deep levels for as-grown and five deep levels after irradiation. The Richardson constant, as determined from a modified Richardson plot assuming a Gaussian distribution of barrier heights for the as-grown and irradiated samples were 133 and 151 A cm 2 K 2, respectively. These values are similar to literature values. National Research Foundation (NRF) of South African (Grant specific unique reference <b>number</b> (<b>UID)</b> 78838). [URL]...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the defects {{introduced}} in n-type 4 H-SiC during electron beam deposition (EBD) of tungsten by deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS). The results from currentvoltage and capacitance-voltage measurements showed deviations from ideality due to damage, but were still well suited to a DLTS study. We compared the electrical properties of six electrically active defects observed in EBD Schottky barrier diodes with those introduced in resistively evaporated material on the same material, as-grown, {{as well as a}}fter high energy electron irradiation (HEEI). We observed that EBD introduced two electrically active defects with energies EC – 0. 42 and EC – 0. 70 eV in the 4 H-SiC at and near the interface with the tungsten. The defects introduced by EBD had properties similar to defect attributed to the silicon or carbon vacancy, introduced during HEEI of 4 H-SiC. EBD was also responsible for the increase in concentration of a defect attributed to nitrogen impurities (EC – 0. 10) as well as a defect linked to the carbon vacancy (EC – 0. 67). Annealing at 400 °C in Ar ambient removed these two defects introduced during the EBD.

40|$|Chrysoporthe austroafricana (Cryphonectriaceae) is a {{damaging}} canker pathogen on Eucalyptus {{species in}} Southern Africa. Recent {{studies have shown}} that the fungus occurs on native Syzygium species and that it has apparently undergone a host range expansion from these native trees to infect non-native Eucalyptus. The aim of this study was to consider whether C. austroafricana and other Cryphonectriaceae might exist as endophytes in native Myrtaceae, providing a source of inoculum to infect non-native Myrtales. Healthy branches were collected from Myrtaceae in Mozambique, incubated in florist foam, allowed to dry gradually and monitored for the appearance of fruiting bodies resembling species in the Cryphonectriaceae. Isolates were identified based on DNA sequence data. Two species in the Cryphonectriaceae were obtained, representing the first evidence that species in the Cryphonectriaceae occur as endophytes on native Myrtales, thus providing a source of inoculum to infect non-native and susceptible trees. This has important implications regarding the movement of planting stock used by ornamental tree and forestry enterprises.
