5|$|Other approaches, {{loosely based}} around New Urbanism, are {{successfully}} reducing environmental impacts by altering {{the built environment}} to create and preserve sustainable cities which support sustainable transport. Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles, and have significantly lower environmental impacts {{across a range of}} measures, compared with those living in sprawling suburbs. In sustainable architecture the recent movement of New Classical Architecture promotes a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops smart growth, architectural tradition and classical design. This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture, as well as opposing solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl. Both trends started in the 1980s. The concept of Circular flow land <b>use</b> <b>management</b> has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land take by urban sprawl.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{threat to}} the {{ecosystem}} is grazing by feral sheep (Ovis aries), cattle (Bos primigenius), and goats (Capra hircus) introduced to the island in the late 18th century. Feral animal competition with commercial grazing was severe enough that a program to eradicate them existed {{as far back as}} the late 1920s, and continued through to 1949. One of the results of this grazing was the increased prevalence of herbaceous and woody plants, both endemic and introduced, that were resistant to browsing. The feral animals were almost eradicated, and numbered a few hundred in the 1950s. However, an influx of local hunters led to the feral species being valued as game animals, and in 1959 the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, the governing body in charge of conservation and land <b>use</b> <b>management,</b> changed its policy to a sustained-control program designed to facilitate the sport.|$|E

When the 1971 Act was passed, the BLM assessed herd areas to determine which places could become HMAs based on whether they had adequate food, water, cover, and space to [...] "sustain healthy and diverse wild horse and burro populations over the long-term". [...] Some herd areas still contain feral horses or burros but for a number of reasons—including size of herd, habitat, and land ownership—they are not currently managed for equines by the BLM. [...] Additional wild, free-roaming horses and burros are found on Wild Horse and Burro Territories in six states under the auspices of the United States Forest Service (USFS) and are also protected by the Act. Some of the USFS territories are managed in cooperation with the BLM. The USFS has about 50 Wild Horse and Burro Territories. [...] There are also some protected free-roaming equine populations found on lands governed by the National Park Service (NPS).|$|E

The second essay investigates the empirical impact of the strategic uncertainty on the interactive <b>use</b> of <b>management</b> control systems and how this impact fluctuates according to different organizational contexts in which top-level hospital managers make decisions and control. The third essay examines the relative contribution of the strategic priorities (i. e., organizational driver) and top-level hospital managers’ personal characteristics (i. e., individual driver) to explain the interactive <b>use</b> of <b>management</b> control systems. Based on these three essays, this {{doctoral thesis}} enlarges the knowledge on the theoretical and empirical meaning of the interactive <b>use</b> of <b>management</b> control systems and provides empirical evidence on the drivers of the interactive <b>use</b> of <b>management</b> control systems in a hospital setting.

The Government of the Republic of Indonesia has launched Diagnosis - Related Group in order to improve national health care system. On top of that, the government also put effort in improving hospital management system in general. Hospital system {{plays an important role in}} the creation of healthy society. Though hospital is a non-profit organization in its nature, it has to be professionally managed. In so doing, adequate managerial accounting information system is a vital support. Manager’s knowledge on managerial accounting has significant impact on his/her style in <b>using</b> <b>management</b> accounting information system. Interactive manager’s style in <b>using</b> <b>management</b> accounting information will direct the development of adequate management accounting information system. Hospital is an organization with highly diversified products. For that reason, activity-based management deemed fit for hospital. This research surveyed 68 hospitals in Jogjakarta Special Region and Central Java to investigate the significant impact of manager’s management accounting knowledge on managers’ style in <b>using</b> <b>management</b> accounting information. It then investigated the impact of manager’s style on the existence of activity-based management in those hospitals. Further, this research examines the DRG acceptability among those hospitals. This research employed Partial Least Square (PLS) to study the impact of managers’ knowledge on managers’ style in <b>using</b> <b>management</b> accounting information and the impact of this style on the readiness of implementing activity-based <b>management.</b> It also <b>used</b> mann-whitney test for assessing whether the distribution of those variables has equal values in private and public hospitals.

This research also found a relatively low acceptability of Diagnosis-Related Group system among surveyed hospitals.
