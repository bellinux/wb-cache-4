500|$|To {{play the}} part of Pinker, cast {{director}} Rick Millikan read a number of actors. At the last minute, Millikan {{decided to make a}} call to noted actor John Diehl, famous for his work in Nixon, Stargate, and Miami Vice. Millikan explained that, [...] " [...] had been on my list to put into the show since Day One. [...] It turned out the producers like him too—he'd read for <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> times already—and {{we were able to get}} him in without even a reading".|$|E
500|$|She {{was there}} with Sean ... and she played <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> tracks. There were two newies on mono {{cassettes}} which he did at home ... o I checked it out with Sean, because I didn't want {{him to have a}} problem with it. He said, [...] "Well, it'll be weird hearing a dead guy on lead vocal. But give it a try." [...] I said to them both, [...] "If it doesn't work out, you can veto it." [...] When I told George and Ringo I'd agreed to that they were going, [...] "What? What if we love it?" [...] It didn't come to that, luckily. I said to Yoko, [...] "Don't impose too many conditions on us, it's really difficult to do this, spiritually. We don't know, we may hate each other after two hours in the studio and just walk out. So don't put any conditions, it's tough enough." ...|$|E
500|$|Halifax {{started off}} Game 5 {{at home on}} a low note, with Liam McMorrow {{committing}} four personal fouls {{in the first three}} minutes. Nevertheless, Halifax pulled away with the 125–91 victory, putting them one win away from the title. Rainmen forward Forrest Fisher complained about Windsor, [...] "They're playing very physical, and at times a little bit dirty with sucker punches, and we started playing into their game (Friday) and that's not <b>us.</b> <b>A</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> us can play like that, myself included, and we came out tonight and I told them 'hey, let me take the hits, I'm used to that. You guys play your normal game.' We play the way we play, and it doesn't matter how they play." [...] According to The Chronicle Herald, [...] "the game featured several incidents that threatened to escalate into a full-scale brawl." [...] The teams' coaches would frequently have to break up skirmishes and confront officials for what they felt were bad calls.|$|E
6000|$|His mother {{undertook}} {{that for}} three-and-sixpence {{a week he}} should [...] "make himself generally useful" [...] to <b>us</b> for <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hours every morning.|$|R
60|$|Our {{exceedingly}} frugal meal of bread-fruit over, Captain Bob waddled up to <b>us</b> with <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> long poles hooked at one end, {{and several}} large baskets of woven cocoa-nut branches.|$|R
5000|$|... “This trade helps <b>us</b> address <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> {{different}} areas, {{areas that}} we needed to get stronger in. It not only provides us with size, but also with energy,” said John Paxson.|$|R
2500|$|In September 2009, it was {{announced}} that Metallica's Lars Ulrich was attempting to assemble a tour with the [...] "Big Four" [...] on one bill. [...] "It all started when Rick Rubin encouraged <b>us,</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years before, to revisit some of our earlier records," [...] he told Kerrang! founder Geoff Barton in 2010. [...] "Last year, we sat down and took stock of all the good fortune and good times we'd enjoyed. And we basically – as you know, because you were invited – tried to put 200 {{of the people who were}} primarily responsible for us being inducted into the Hall of Fame in one room, in one place, for a couple of days. We got most of them over to Cleveland, where the ceremony was held, and it was a great trip down memory lane. In the wake of that, this whole thing – the Big Four tour – came up." ...|$|E
6000|$|RAINA (to Bluntschli with an {{intuitive}} guess at {{his state of}} mind). I daresay you think <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> grown up babies, don't you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are in for}} it now!" [...] cried Captain Tanner. [...] "Every {{man must}} do his duty or we are lost. They are coming on <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hundred stronger!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave a {{negative}} review, saying the film [...] "runs out of gas, leaving <b>us</b> with <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> final [...] "Forget You" [...] (shall we say) moments. Thanks. Thanks for nothing." ...|$|R
60|$|Yes, said Mistrust, {{for just}} before <b>us</b> lie <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> lions in the way, whether {{sleeping}} or waking we know not, {{and we could}} not think, if we came within reach, but they would presently pull us in pieces.|$|R
6000|$|A dust {{down the}} road caught Curtis's attention. [...] "The mail will soon be in {{and then we will}} see how all this affects the press of the State; the Chicago dailies will not reach <b>us</b> for <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's right, Jack, hang up your oilskin there. Johnson, give <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> towels; we {{have been}} pretty well smothered up there on deck. Now {{what have you got}} for us?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All the better. I {{hope that}} they will give <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> months to get into shape. There is but little time for drill and {{discipline}} when we are once in the field." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The present duke's a most {{exemplary}} churchman," [...] the Dean interposed, with Christian charity for a nobleman of position. [...] "He gave <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> thousand {{last year}} for the cathedral restoration fund." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mistrust, [...] "for {{just before}} <b>us</b> lie <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> lions in the way, whether {{sleeping}} or waking we know not; {{and we could}} not think, if we came within reach, but they would presently pull us in pieces." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bishop," [...] {{said the}} rather sharp voice; and the bishop trotted {{across the room}} {{to the back of the}} sofa, on which his wife was sitting. [...] "Miss Dunstable thinks that she will be able to come to <b>us</b> for <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days, after we leave the duke's." ...|$|R
5|$|For the album's {{striking}} front-cover image, Wilkes used a Kirlian {{photograph of}} Harrison's hand holding a Hindu medallion. The photo was taken at UCLA's parapsychology department, {{as was the}} shot used on the back cover, where Harrison instead holds three <b>US</b> coins: <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> quarters and <b>a</b> silver dollar.|$|R
6000|$|... "Even now, I should think, {{they are}} {{expecting to see}} the {{brigantine}} close behind us in chase, and don't suspect what we are up to. Don't head straight for her," [...] {{he said to the}} helmsman, [...] "take <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> lengths outside her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hawkins," [...] Frank said, {{putting his}} hand in his pocket, [...] "give the men who came to help <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> sovereigns each, and tell our men that I don't want them {{to talk about the}} affair. I will see you about it again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you say, boys," [...] Harry {{asked when}} breakfast had been cooked and eaten, [...] "if we stop here for to-day? Likely enough {{we may get}} some game, and if not it won't matter, for the deer will last <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days." ...|$|E
5000|$|John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: [...] "Any viewer {{entering}} the film without wanting to hug Waterston {{will have a}} crush by the picture's end, with the actor perfectly embodying a flavor of learned humanism that carries <b>us</b> through <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> more abstractly angst discussions of society's decay." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tom, we GOT to keep mum. You know that. That Injun devil wouldn't {{make any}} more <b>of</b> drownding <b>us</b> than <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> cats, if we was to squeak 'bout {{this and they}} didn't hang him. Now, look-a-here, Tom, less take and swear to one another--that's what we got to do--swear to keep mum." ...|$|R
5000|$|... {{enters the}} county from the south, angling northwest, and merges with <b>US</b> 31 for <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> miles until Benzonia where M-115 {{continues}} west {{to end in}} Frankfort.|$|R
60|$|He {{stayed with}} <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hours, and {{returned}} homewards in perfect good spirits, having given me his word of honour he would dine with us the next day. He put his immense {{key into the}} grille, and unlocked it; but the gate would not open: IT WAS BOLTED WITHIN.|$|E
6000|$|... "It would {{certainly}} be better; besides, it would save <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> miles' walk each time we wanted a meal. However, when we once set to work I have no doubt we shall establish ourselves in the castle. Of course one of us will come down morning and evening to see to the animals." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! you'll {{never be}} a man while you are under her. She only wants to keep <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> babies for ever--sending us to bed, and making such a figure of me;' and Lucy {{relieved}} her feelings by five perpendicular leaps into the air, like an India-rubber ball, her hair flying out, and her eyes flashing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, my dear. <b>A</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> {{months on}} the farm will do all of my nieces good. Beth is still with Louise, you know, and they must find the city deadly dull, just now. The farm's the thing. And the Major can run up to see <b>us</b> for <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> weeks in the hot weather, and we'll all have a glorious, lazy time." ...|$|R
50|$|Basan met {{her husband}} in Turkey and they moved {{to live in the}} <b>US</b> for <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years before {{returning}} to Scotland. Their first book, Classic Turkish Cookery, was nominated for two awards and gained them a weekly slot on the Sunday Herald and a contract for their second book, The Middle Eastern Kitchen. The couple are no longer together.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} {{extremely}} {{glad to have}} them," [...] the settler said. [...] "This is a very busy time with <b>us,</b> and <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> extra hands will be very useful. They will learn a good deal as to our ways here {{in the course of}} a month, and, as you say, it would be far better for them to be at work than to be loafing about the place doing nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] he said, [...] "we {{will make}} for Aberfilly; they think us all cooped up here, {{and will be}} rejoicing in our {{supposed}} deaths. We will strike one more blow, and then, driving before <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> score of oxen {{for the use of}} the army, rejoin Wallace. Methinks we shall have taken a fair vengeance for Kerr's doings at Glen Cairn." ...|$|E
60|$|These {{arrangements}} took <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days or so. On {{the third}} we started, without seeing you, my friend, or any one else that I knew, since {{just at that}} time every one seemed {{to be away from}} Pretoria. You, I remember, had by now become the Master of the High Court and were, they informed me at your office, absent on circuit.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, {{the best}} thing you can do is to go down to the waist, slip off your togs, and have a few buckets of water poured over you. That will wake you up, and you will feel ever so much more comfortable, afterwards. I have just told the steward to make <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> cups of coffee. They will be ready by the time you have had your wash." ...|$|E
60|$|We thought our voyaging {{was at a}} {{full stop}} now; but three <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> with <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> our negroes, {{mounting}} the hills another way, to view {{the course of the}} river, we found a fair channel again after about half a mile's march, and that it was like to hold <b>us</b> <b>a</b> good way further. So we set all hands to work, unloaded our cargo, and hauled our canoes on shore, {{to see if we could}} carry them.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll have {{to provide}} <b>us</b> with about <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> million dollars," [...] Van Teyl replied, [...] "and I should think you would pretty well break Fischer for a time. Frankly, he's an {{important}} client, and we don't want him broken, even temporarily." ...|$|R
50|$|The skies were {{overcast}} but {{the ceiling}} was 8000'. It took <b>us</b> only <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> minutes before we were flying over the intercoastal waterway and into {{the vastness of the}} Gulf. I held Dad on my lap for the last part of his journey and told him again what a wonderful man he was. I silently said the Lord's Prayer and we slowed the plane down to 60 kts. With Morgan holding the window open, I kissed him goodbye and released him.|$|R
