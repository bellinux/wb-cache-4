40|$|There {{have long}} been {{concerns}} that federal crop insurance subsidies may significantly impact land use decisions. It {{is well known that}} classical insurance market information asymmetry problems can lead to a social excess of risky land entering crop production. We provide a conceptual model to show that the problem will arise absent any information failures. This is because the subsidy is (a) proportional to acres planted, and (b) greatest for the most production risky land. Using field-level yield data, we follow this observation through to establish the implications of subsidies for the extent of crop production, with particular emphasis on the <b>US</b> <b>Prairie</b> Pothole Region, where cropland growth is likely to have marked adverse environmental impacts. Simulation results show that up to 3 % of land under federal crop insurance would have not been converted from grassland if there had been no crop insurance subsidies.

40|$|Anthropogenic {{impacts on}} North American grasslands, a highly {{endangered}} ecosystem, {{have led to}} declines of prairie dogs, a keystone species, over 98 % of their historical range. While impacts of this loss on maintenance of grassland biodiversity have been widely documented, much less {{is known about the}} consequences on the supply of ecosystem services. Here we assessed the effect of prairie dogs in the supply of five ecosystem services by comparing grasslands currently occupied by prairie dogs, grasslands devoid of prairie dogs, and areas that used to be occupied by prairie dogs that are currently dominated by mesquite scrub. Groundwater recharge, regulation of soil erosion, regulation of soil productive potential, soil carbon storage and forage availability were consistently quantitatively or qualitatively higher in prairie dog grasslands relative to grasslands or mesquite scrub. Our findings indicate a severe loss of ecosystem services associated to the absence of prairie dogs.

40|$|Stream {{restoration}} practice typically {{relies on}} a geomorphological design approach in which the integration of ecological criteria is limited and generally qualitative, although the most commonly stated project objective is to restore biological integrity by enhancing habitat and water quality. Restoration has achieved mixed results in terms of ecological successes and {{it is evident that}} improved methodologies for assessment and design are needed. A design approach is suggested for mesohabitat restoration based on a review and integration of fundamental processes associated with: (1) lotic ecological concepts; (2) applied geomorphic processes for mesohabitat self-maintenance; (3) multidimensional hydraulics and habitat suitability modeling; (4) species functional traits correlated with fish mesohabitat use; and (5) multi-stage ecohydraulics-based mesohabitat classification. Classification of mesohabitat units demonstrated in this article were based on fish preferences specifically linked to functional trait strategies (i. e., feeding resting, evasion, spawning, and flow refugia), recognizing that habitat preferences shift by season and flow stage. A multi-stage classification scheme developed under this premise provides the basic “building blocks” for ecological design criteria for stream restoration. The scheme was developed for Midwest <b>US</b> <b>prairie</b> streams, but the conceptual framework for mesohabitat classification and functional traits analysis can be applied to other ecoregions...|$|R

40|$|Insect herbivores play {{a pivotal}} role in {{regulating}} plant production and community composition, and their role in terrestrial ecosystems is partly determined by their feeding behavior and performance among plants of differing nutritional quality. Historically, nitrogen (N) has been considered the primary limiting nutrient of herbivorous insects, but N {{is only one of many}} potential nutrients important to insect performance. Of these nutrients, phosphorus (P) is perhaps the most important because somatic growth depends upon P-rich ribosomal RNA. Yet relatively few studies have assessed the strength of P-limitation for terrestrial insects and even fewer have simultaneously manipulated both N and P to assess the relative strengths of N- and P-limitation. Here, we tested for potential N and P limitation, as well as N:P co-limitation, on Chorthippis curtipennis (Orthoptera, Acrididae), an abundant member of arthropod communities of central <b>US</b> <b>prairies.</b> Our results demonstrate weak evidence for both N and P limitation of C. curtipennis growth rates in laboratory feeding assays. Importantly, P-limitation was just as strong as N-limitation, but we found no evidence for NP co-limitation in our study. Furthermore, nutrient limitation was not apparent in field studies, suggesting that insect growth rates may be predominately controlled by other factors, including temperature and predation. Our results suggest that P should be jointly considered, along with N, as a primary determinant of herbivore feeding behavior under both current and future climate conditions...|$|R
40|$|Using the {{theoretical}} formalism of ReVelle (2001 d), we have analyzed 22 European (EN) and <b>US</b> <b>Prairie</b> Network fireballs (PN) {{with the most}} precise trajectory information available for shape change and fragmentation effects. For 14 bolides the shape change parameter, {mu}, was always > 0 and for the other 8 cases there were instances of {mu} 0 {{and in a few}} instances was briefly even smaller than the pressure scale height. This is the necessary condition in addition to the sufficient condition of {mu} {approx} 0. 10, indicating that substantial shape change has taken place during entry for these bolides. This is fully consistent with the recent analyses of ReVelle and Ceplecha (2001 g) of the changes in the shape-density coefficient, K, with time as well. Thus, the use of the {mu} = 2 / 3 (self-similar solution with no shape change) is not recommended for bolide modeling efforts. From our results we can conclude that most of the US DoD bolides can be successfully modeled using single-body theory without resorting to the 'pancake' catastrophic fragmentation model that was 'rediscovered' in the early 1990 's by a number of workers.

40|$|Shifts in {{the duck}} {{community}} composition in the Canadian Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) have been evident {{over the past}} 25 years {{for reasons that are}} not entirely clear. Several duck species have increased in abundance whereas others have remained stable, or have declined, despite shifts in agricultural land use from annually tilled cropland to more pasture and haylands, and increases in spring pond counts since 2008. I considered three main hypotheses that could account for species-specific changes in duck abundances within the Canadian PPR; (i) redistribution; (ii) climate and (iii) land use. First, I examined whether shifts in populations of eleven duck species (seven dabbling ducks, four diving ducks) could be due to redistribution from other regions either to or from the Canadian PPR. I found no support for this hypothesis for any species. Trends and timing of changes in duck abundances were generally similar and coincident in <b>US</b> <b>prairie,</b> Canadian PPR and southern boreal forest biomes in all species. To test for effects of variations in climate, I used > 20, 000 nesting records for eight upland nesting duck species and related the timing of nesting and subsequent nest success to annual variations in spring temperature and moisture conditions. Furthermore, I tested for the relative importance of antecedent winter climate on nesting activities using winter El Niño Southern Oscillation indices. In general, nesting occurred earlier in warmer springs and following warmer, wetter winters. However, the magnitude of responses varied, indicating species-specific responses to variations in climate. Early nesting was the most influential factor for increasing nest survival and because timing advanced following wetter winters, this may provide a cross-seasonal mechanism for how winter climate can subsequently impact offspring recruitment in species like mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). To evaluate the land use change hypothesis, I related changes in duck abundances to changes in ponds and upland habitat composition using unique monitoring data collected in the PPR in 1985 and 2011. I used data from 42 transects distributed across the PPR to first characterize changes in upland habitat and then relate these changes to abundances of four common dabbling duck species. Pond abundances increased between ~ 1985 and ~ 2011, and cropland was converted to tame grass (i. e., pastureland). Changes in abundances of mallard and northern shoveler (A. clypeata) were primarily driven by changes in pond abundances. In blue-winged teal (A. discors), abundances of breeding birds increased more rapidly than other species and there was some evidence that conversion of cropland to tame grass resulted in greater teal abundances. Change in abundance of northern pintail (A. acuta) was not related to changes in ponds or upland habitat conditions. Overall, I found no evidence for the redistribution hypothesis; however, I did find evidence for species-specific responses to both variations in climate and changes in land use. This implies that species respond differently to various drivers and may be a partial explanation for observed differences in population trajectories. Although further research should seek to explain increases in certain species over others, my work provides insights into potential species-specific population drivers. This information is critical in informing managers about possible areas where conservation actions could be implemented to sustain waterfowl populations...|$|R
