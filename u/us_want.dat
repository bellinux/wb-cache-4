25|$|There is {{one final}} matter to consider: the {{possibility}} that euthanasia not only would be performed on incompetent patients {{in violation of the}} rules—as an abuse of the safeguards—but would become the rule in the context of demographic and budgetary pressures on Social Security and Medicare as the Baby Boom generation begins to retire, around 2010. Once legalized, physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia would become routine. Over time doctors would become comfortable giving injections to end life and Americans would become comfortable having euthanasia as an option. Comfort would make <b>us</b> <b>want</b> to extend the option to others who, in society's view, are suffering and leading purposeless lives. The ethical arguments for physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia, advocates of euthanasia have maintained, do not apply to euthanasia only when it is voluntary; they {{can also be used to}} justify some kinds of nonvoluntary euthanasia of the incompetent.|$|E
25|$|I cannot {{understand}} why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest—and scientists have to be—we must admit that religion is a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God {{is a product of}} the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of <b>us</b> <b>want</b> to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit. Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards—in heaven if not on earth—all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of all mortal sins.|$|E

500|$|Interviewed at {{the time}} of the album's release, Nicky Wire said that the track [...] "Ifwhiteamericatoldthetruthforonedayit'sworldwouldfallapart" [...] was [...] "not a {{completely}} anti-American song", but instead was about [...] "how the most empty culture in the world can dominate in such a total sense". [...] "Of Walking Abortion" [...] is about right-wing totalitarianism, of which Wire commented: [...] "there's a worm in human nature that makes <b>us</b> <b>want</b> to be dominated". [...] "Archives of Pain", dealing with the glorification of serial killers and seemingly advocating capital punishment, he said [...] "was the song that me and Richey worried about most [...] the song isn't a right wing statement, it's just against this fascination with people who kill". Later in 1994, Bradfield described the song as [...] "one of the most important things we've done" [...] but said it was also [...] "very right-wing" [...] and [...] "miscalculated".|$|E
500|$|The band started {{recording}} the album in London {{a week after}} the September 11 attacks in the United States, during which their [...] "poignant songs ... garnered larger audiences". Coldplay had never stayed in London for an extended period before and were bombarded by problems focusing on the production process. They decided to relocate to Liverpool, where they had recorded some of the songs on Parachutes. Lead singer Chris Martin said that once there they [...] "became obsessed with recording". [...] "In My Place" [...] was the first song recorded for the album and the one that the band released as the album's lead single [...] "because it was the song that made <b>us</b> <b>want</b> to do a second album. It kept us going and made us think we could still write songs", following [...] "a strange period of not really knowing what we were doing" [...] three months after the success of Parachutes.|$|E

[...] Brown has reiterated that she feared Dot would become boring if she married Jim, but that producers persuaded her that the marriage {{might be a good}} thing. On-screen, Dot had suffered the death of her grandson Ashley, and Brown felt that a traumatic event like that would have changed her character. In her opinion, the only way Dot would have got over Ashley's death [...] "would be to have someone else to care for and when it happened there was nobody [...] with marrying Jim she gets a family– that's what persuaded me.

500|$|None of Cooper's films {{released}} in 2015—Aloha, Burnt, or Joy—performed particularly {{well at the}} box office. He starred in Cameron Crowe's Aloha with Emma Stone and Rachel McAdams. The project became controversial after the Media Action Network for Asian-Americans accused the filmmakers of whitewashing the cast. Despite the criticism, he was nominated for Choice Movie Actor – Comedy at the 2015 Teen Choice Awards. In John Wells' drama Burnt, Cooper played a chef who decides to regain his former glory after drug abuse takes a toll on his career. While the film was criticized for its [...] "overdone clichés", Jon Frosch of The Hollywood Reporter wrote of Cooper's performance, [...] "the actor gives a fully engaged performance that almost makes <b>us</b> <b>want</b> to forgive the movie's laziness. Almost." [...] His supporting role in the biopic Joy reunited him with David O. Russell and Lawrence. In 2016, he had a voice cameo in the thriller 10 Cloverfield Lane, and played a supporting part in War Dogs, co-produced under his and Phillips Will's production company Joint Effort. In 2017, Cooper again voiced Rocket Raccoon, in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.|$|E
500|$|Other songs {{allude to}} darker themes {{of fear and}} {{personal}} insecurities.

And all of those things I feel happy to express". Caitlin White of The 405 believed the songs as [...] "hold forth on the most important issues in a woman's life by delving into [...] personal experience with them". [...] "Jealous" [...] addresses fidelity and features lyrics in which the protagonist experiences [...] "promises, suspicion and potential revenge". It contains an [...] "uncanny mix of tones and styles", most prominently a morose bassline replete with electronic yelps. [...] "Mine", a futuristic R song with jazz elements, is self-reflective, with lyrics that reference marital strife and difficulties with postnatal depression. The neo soul song [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] is a self-empowerment anthem that decries society's obsession with harmful and unattainable standards of beauty. The song uses audio snippets of beauty pageants which Beyoncé contested in to frame the song in the context of her childhood.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. Several reviews wrote positively of {{the ensemble}} and character acting. Hannah Lawrence from Hollywood was happy with romance of the episode, writing [...] "It seems clear that the writers are spending more time on characters finding love, and I actually enjoy it very much ... I suspect the writers are aware that ultimately what all of <b>us</b> <b>want</b> for the Dunder-Mifflin employees is love." [...] CliqueClack wrote positively of the episode, praising the ensemble acting, and wrote, [...] "Overall, another solid ensemble episode. Way to go, The Office!" [...] Many other reviews compared the episode, either positively or negatively, to previous episodes. Jeffrey Hyatt from Screencrave gave the episode an 8/10 rating and wrote, [...] "I'd {{say it was the}} strongest of the six episodes so far this season ... 'Doomsday' delivered that classic, Office formula where everything just works – and it feels so right." [...] Joseph Kratzer from WhatCulture awarded the episode 3-and-a-half stars out of five and compared it to the season's previous episodes, writing, [...] "For a minute there I thought season eight of The Office was going {{to be some kind of}} subpar shut-out, but thankfully 'Doomsday' has lifted the series out of the rut it's been in ... I feel 'Doomsday' was successful because it captured a sense of ease and fluidity the show's been lacking severely since Michael's departure." ...|$|E

500|$|Yahoo! Music writer [...] Billy Johnson, Jr. found a [...] "vibrant dance energy" [...] in the song's {{music and}} further hailed its message as [...] "uplifting". Similarly, Complex writer Zach Frydenlund echoed his statements, {{describing}} the song as [...] "uplifting". In a review for Fuse, Jeff Benjamin described [...] "Say Yes" [...] as a [...] "gospel-island hybrid". He {{felt that it}} was interesting to hear Williams as the lead vocalist instead of Beyoncé, who had previously served as the lead vocalist of Destiny's Child. Benhamin finished his review, concluding, [...] "It all sort of makes <b>us</b> <b>want</b> to twerk and throw our hands to heavens at the same time." [...] Brownie Marie of Christian Today praised Williams' vocal performance during the song's hook, along with the [...] "well-controlled riffs". She also wrote that Beyoncé is [...] "vocally subdued on the track, and truly lets Williams' voice receive the attention". Hayen Manders from Refinery29 felt that the song was Williams' [...] "turn to shine". In a more mixed review, Vulture columnist Lindsey Weber wrote that the song is not [...] "a total mess" [...] and that listeners might sing the praises in the song along with it. At the 2014 Soul Train Music Awards, [...] "Say Yes" [...] is currently nominated in the category for Best Gospel/Inspirational Song.|$|E
500|$|... "Hypnotico" [...] {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Several journalists noted {{the similarities between}} the song and other Gaga works, with Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly stating that it sounded like [...] "a watered down version of 'Poker Face'" [...] and Scott Shetler of PopCrush elaborating that [...] "like many of [...] Gaga's songs", it is [...] "likely to stick in your head long after the song has ended". Allison Stewart from The Washington Post further expanded on this view, stating that [...] "without the slightest hint of noblesse oblige" [...] to Gaga, [...] "Hypnotico" [...] is a synthy, [...] "burbly slip" [...] of a song. Eliot Glazer of MTV Buzzworthy stated that the song seems to continue right where Lopez's 1999 hit single [...] "Waiting for Tonight" [...] left off, [...] "making <b>us</b> <b>want</b> to put on our short shorts and dance". In addition, he concluded that [...] "The thump that rides the song's undercurrent of ethereal echoes and a group chant of the chorus is a pretty solid reminder that this is most definitely a Gaga jam, which quickly gained J. Lo's approval". Amos Barshad of Vulture showcased his displeasure with the song, elaborating that although [...] "you can sort of tell" [...] that Gaga wrote the song, that was not an indication that it would become an instant hit, casting it as [...] "Bland and half-baked", and concluding that [...] "it was certainly farmed out for a reason".|$|E
500|$|Allmusic's MacKenzie Wilson {{wrote that}} Maybe This Christmas Too? {{would appeal to}} [...] "both casual and die-hard music fans of all ages". Wilson called Wainwright's {{performance}} [...] "classic chamber pop with a warm spirit" [...] and also noted the [...] "fetching" [...] graphic design work for the album's cover art by Brian [...] "Goatpillow" [...] Brooks of Cosmic Debris. Andrew Gilstrap's review for PopMatters also complimented [...] "Spotlight on Christmas", calling the song a [...] "clever piece of class-conscious commentary" [...] that provides a [...] "perfect example of [...] meticulous toyshop brand of pop." [...] Simmy Richman of The Independent considered The Flaming Lips' rendition of [...] "White Christmas" [...] to be the [...] "strangest" [...] he had ever heard. Gilstrap used the same adjective ("strange") to describe [...] "O Holy Night", and thought [...] "Silent Night" [...] was [...] "incredibly potent" [...] despite its short length. The New York Times Kelefa Sanneh called [...] "White Christmas" [...] "spooky" [...] and wrote that the album [...] "brings to the world something more ambivalent than joy". Gilbert concluded that Maybe This Christmas Too? [...] "feels just about right" [...] and [...] "does a fine job of representing the less than stellar aspects of a wintry, commercialized holiday like Christmas." [...] In 2008 The A.V. Club included [...] "Spotlight on Christmas" [...] as number thirty-nine on its list of [...] "42 holiday entertainments that don't make <b>us</b> <b>want</b> to claw our eyes out with rage".|$|E

500|$|Natalie Finn from E! Online was {{disappointed}} with the track, feeling that although the releases from Born This Way were not that [...] "catchy", {{all of them were}} about the same subject of [...] "the importance of being ourselves. Oh well, maybe we're just waiting for the next 'Bad Romance' to sweep us off our feet. Or the next 'Speechless' to make us cry. Or even the next 'Just Dance' to really make <b>us</b> <b>want</b> to dance." [...] Jason Lipshultz from Billboard felt that the track was another anthem for individualism, with Gaga's hair used as a metaphor for her wild personality. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave a mixed review stating that the song is a [...] "derivative but perfectly serviceable club track about highlights that's turned into a dumping ground for every bad idea Gaga's had in the last 12 months: schmaltzy piano-woman melodies, overwrought choruses, inexplicable sax solos." [...] Rick Fulton, while writing in the Daily Record, called [...] "Hair" [...] a [...] "great tune" [...] and an [...] "Europop high-energy epic", while giving it four out of five points. Ian Hope from [...] BBC Online described [...] "Hair" [...] as an [...] "empowering freeway rocker about self expression." [...] The Independent writer Andy Gill compared the song to those by guitarist David Crosby, and described it as a statement of rebellious individuality. According to Los Angeles Times Randall Roberts, Gaga [...] "celebrates her follicles" [...] in the song.|$|E

[...] Richard Defendorf of Orlando Sentinel gave a positive review, saying [...] "Madonna's 'Virgin Tour' was very enjoyable and she put her music video charms in her live performances." [...] Maya Hathoray from The Miami Herald said that [...] "We know [...] sexy, exotically beautiful and her funk/pop songs make <b>us</b> <b>want</b> to dance, but on stage, she is extremely tame compared to her raw persona in her music videos. She is like daddy's little girl." [...] Mary Edgar Smith from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution observed that [...] "It was obvious from the apparel of the young girls at last week's Virgin Tour concerts in Tampa and Orlando, Fla., that the 26-year-old singer [...] had more {{to give to the}} music world than what others suggest. She will be {{a force to be reckoned}} with." [...] Stephen Holden from The New York Times commented, [...] "While her pubescent lookalike fans cheer approvingly, the star's manipulation of such symbols as a wedding gown, a cross, furs and jewels becomes a lighthearted communal psychodrama. Madonna has brought traditional little girl's games of dress-up and playing with dolls (using oneself as model) into the television age by turning them into a public spectacle." [...] A review in Variety by John Gleeson said that [...] "Madonna's singing was like a soundtrack to a more visceral display of herself, her persona, her nonstop dancing and her surprisingly explicit sexual dare, which included a visual climax—so to speak—to every other song." [...] Paul Grein from Billboard said that [...] "Madonna's show was stylish, well-paced and consistently entertaining." ...|$|E
