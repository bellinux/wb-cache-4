40|$|My {{thesis is}} focused on the issues related to a sale of <b>undertaking</b> or part of <b>undertaking</b> {{pursuant}} to the Contract on the Sale of <b>Undertaking.</b> This contract type is governed by the provisions of S. 477 - 488 a of the Commercial Code. After the introduction contained in the first chapter, the second chapter deals with the legal definition of an <b>Undertaking</b> and its part. The concept of <b>Undertaking</b> described in the Czech Commercial Code is broadly constructed in order to cover many different components as a part of any <b>Undertaking.</b> The important distinction between the European law and the laws of the Czech Republic is that the Czech law understands the <b>undertaking</b> merely as a specific object of legal relations. The European law, however, recognized the <b>Undertaking</b> as a subject of legal relations. The third chapter identifies other contract types which could cause the same results as the sale of undertaking; among other the sales contract and specific innominated contract. The legal provisions of contract for sale of <b>Undertaking</b> describe the consequences of the sale and analyzed in the fourth chapter of the thesis. The most important legal issues of this contract type can be identified as (i) the transfer of rights and obligations, (ii) exclusion of certain components of the <b>Undertaking,</b> (iii) liability for [...] ...|$|R
