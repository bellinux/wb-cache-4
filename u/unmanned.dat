5|$|On April 24, 1967, Mueller {{published}} an official Apollo mission numbering scheme, using sequential numbers for all flights, manned or <b>unmanned.</b> The sequence would start with Apollo 4 {{to cover the}} first three <b>unmanned</b> flights while retiring the Apollo 1 designation to honor the crew, per their widows' wishes.|$|E
5|$|Proctor, A.A., Kannan, S.K., Raabe, C., Christophersen, H.B., and Johnson, E.N., “Development of an Autonomous Aerial Reconnaissance System at Georgia Tech,” Proceedings of the Association for <b>Unmanned</b> Vehicle Systems International <b>Unmanned</b> Systems Symposium & Exhibition, 2003.|$|E
5|$|A-10PCAS: Proposed <b>unmanned</b> version {{developed}} by Raytheon and Aurora Flight Sciences {{as part of}} DARPA's Persistent Close Air Support program. The PCAS program eventually dropped {{the idea of using}} an optionally manned A-10.|$|E
5|$|After the accident, NASA {{decided to}} give the flight the {{official}} designation of Apollo 1 and then skip to Apollo 4 for the first <b>unmanned</b> orbital test of the CSM, counting the two <b>unmanned</b> suborbital tests AS-201 and 202 {{as part of the}} sequence. The spacecraft problems were corrected, and the Apollo program carried on to reach its objective of landing men on the Moon successfully.|$|E
5|$|Autonomous {{underwater}} vehicles (AUVs) and {{remotely operated}} underwater vehicles (ROVs) can carry out some functions of divers. They can be deployed at greater depths and in more dangerous environments. An AUV is a robot which travels underwater without requiring real-time input from an operator. AUVs constitute {{part of a}} larger group of <b>unmanned</b> undersea systems, a classification that includes non-autonomous ROVs, which are controlled and powered from the surface by an operator/pilot via an umbilical or using remote control. In military applications AUVs are often referred to as <b>unmanned</b> undersea vehicles (UUVs).|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, Michelson {{became an}} adjunct {{associate}} professor in the Georgia Tech School of Aerospace Engineering, where he taught graduate classes in avionics, with emphasis on <b>unmanned</b> aerial vehicles and micro air vehicles.|$|E
5|$|On August 28, after {{emergency}} approvals, an MQ-1 Predator <b>unmanned</b> aerial vehicle {{flew over}} the area, providing infrared video of lurking fires.|$|E
5|$|On September 29, Walter Schirra, Eisele, and Walter Cunningham {{were named}} {{as the prime}} crew for a second Block I CSM flight, AS-205. NASA planned to follow this with an <b>unmanned</b> test flight of the LM (AS-206), then the third manned mission would be a dual flight {{designated}} AS-278 (or AS-207/208), in which AS-207 would launch the first manned Block II CSM, which would then rendezvous and dock with the LM launched <b>unmanned</b> on AS-208.|$|E
5|$|The {{competition}} creator, Robert Michelson, is past President of the Association for <b>Unmanned</b> Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI).|$|E
5|$|The ship {{is capable}} of {{carrying}} Sikorsky S-70 helicopter or <b>unmanned</b> aircraft, along with the associated armaments, 20 tons of JP-5 aircraft fuel, aerial refueling systems and maintenance facilities.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unmanned</b> hot air balloons: The sky lantern is {{an early}} <b>unmanned</b> hot air balloon. The Chinese {{military}} strategist, politician, and inventor Zhuge Liang of the Three Kingdoms era is credited with its invention, and reportedly used it during military campaigns. According to the British scientist, historian, and sinologist Joseph Needham, hot air balloons {{have been used in}} China since the 3rd century BC. In 1783, Joseph-Michel and Jacques-Etienne Montgolfier took part in the first manned hot air balloon flight.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it meets}} the {{definition}} of outer space, the atmospheric density within the first few hundred kilometers above the Kármán line is still sufficient to produce significant drag on satellites. This region contains material left over from previous manned and <b>unmanned</b> launches that are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this debris re-enters Earth's atmosphere periodically.|$|E
5|$|Exploration Flight Test 1 (EFT-1), an <b>unmanned</b> {{test flight}} of Orion's crew module, was {{launched}} on December 5, 2014, atop a Delta IV Heavy rocket. Exploration Mission-1 (EM-1) is the <b>unmanned</b> initial launch of SLS {{that would also}} send Orion on a circumlunar trajectory, which is planned for 2019. The first manned flight of Orion and SLS, Exploration Mission 2 (EM-2) is to launch in 2022; it is a 10- to 14-day mission planned to place a crew of four into Lunar orbit. EM-3 is planned to deliver a crew of 4 to Lunar orbit along with the first module of Deep Space Gateway.|$|E
5|$|In December, {{the ship}} became the testbed for the Navy's RQ-2Pioneer <b>Unmanned</b> Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The drone was {{designed}} {{to serve as an}} aerial spotter for the battleship's guns, thereby allowing the guns to be used against an enemy without the need for an airplane or helicopter spotter. Pioneer passed its tests and made its first deployment that same month aboard Iowa.|$|E
5|$|In July 2014, the FAA {{began an}} {{investigation}} into whether <b>unmanned</b> aircraft used for Maloney’s wedding violated the agency’s ban on drone flights. A spokesman for Maloney, {{who is a member}} of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee’s aviation subcommittee which oversees the FAA, acknowledged that drones were hired.|$|E
5|$|In September 2011, NASA {{announced}} {{the start of}} the Space Launch System program to develop a human-rated heavy lift vehicle. The Space Launch System is intended to launch the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle and other elements towards the Moon, near-Earth asteroids, and one day Mars. The Orion MPCV conducted an <b>unmanned</b> test launch on a Delta IV Heavy rocket in December 2014.|$|E
5|$|In September 2013, AgustaWestland was {{reportedly}} {{in the process}} of acquiring new civil certification for the AW101, target customers include long-range offshore oil platform transport operators and VIP clients. As of February 2014, AgustaWestland was considering adapting the AW101 as a heavyweight <b>unmanned</b> aerial vehicle, it is proposed that in this configuration an AW101 could be optionally manned.|$|E
5|$|Iridium {{has been}} used in the {{radioisotope}} thermoelectric generators of <b>unmanned</b> spacecraft such as the Voyager, Viking, Pioneer, Cassini, Galileo, and New Horizons. Iridium was chosen to encapsulate the plutonium-238 fuel in the generator because it can withstand the operating temperatures of up to 2000°C and for its great strength.|$|E
5|$|John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC), {{is one of}} {{the best-known}} NASA facilities. It has been the launch site for every United States human space flight since 1968. Although such flights are {{currently}} on pause, KSC continues to manage and operate <b>unmanned</b> rocket launch facilities for America's civilian space program from three pads at the adjoining Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.|$|E
5|$|Loitering munitions fit in {{the niche}} between cruise {{missiles}} and <b>unmanned</b> combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) sharing characteristics with both. They differ from cruise missiles {{in that they are}} designed to loiter for a relatively long time around the target area, and from UCAVs in that a loitering munition is intended to be expended in an attack and has a built-in warhead.|$|E
5|$|Loitering munitions may be {{as simple}} as an <b>unmanned</b> aerial vehicle (UAV) with {{attached}} explosives that is sent on a potential kamikaze mission, and may even be constructed with off the shelf commercial quadcopters with strapped on explosives.|$|E
5|$|Maintenance {{remained}} mostly manual {{until the}} 1960s, after which a major rationalization plan shifted this work to machines. This allowed the line's standard to increase, allowing for heavier and faster trains. Hegra, Sona and Flornes Stations were made <b>unmanned</b> in 1970.|$|E
5|$|More than 1,000 <b>unmanned</b> {{missions}} {{have been}} designed to explore the Earth and the solar system. Besides exploration, communication satellites have also been launched by NASA. The missions have been launched directly from Earth or from orbiting space shuttles, which could either deploy the satellite itself, or with a rocket stage to take it farther.|$|E
5|$|QF-16: In September 2013, Boeing and the US Air Force tested an <b>unmanned</b> F-16, {{with two}} US Air Force pilots {{controlling}} the airplane {{from the ground}} as it flew from Tyndall AFB over the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Seven of {{the lines}} are {{operated}} by the Norwegian State Railways, owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications, while the Gjøvik Line is operated by the NSB-owned NSB Gjøvikbanen. The operating deficit is covered by the state for NSB's lines, while NSB Gjøvikbanen's routes are financed by a public service obligation. The trains have two sections, manned and <b>unmanned.</b> Validated ticket-holders can travel in the <b>unmanned</b> section, which have orange doors. Manned sections, with gray doors, have a conductor and allow passengers to purchase tickets. Tickets are available at ticket machines at stations; if bought inboard, there is a 20 Norwegian krone (NOK) surcharge.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the very}} early days of alpine {{mountaineering}} a number of high-altitude mountain refuges have been positioned strategically across the massif to give climbers easier access to the high summits by permitting an overnight stay. The majority are owned by national mountaineering clubs, and many are wardened during the summer months, although the smaller bivouac huts are <b>unmanned</b> and have very basic facilities.|$|E
5|$|The Amador Valley Robotics Team, {{founded in}} 1999, {{is the first}} and only high school team to compete in the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Competition hosted by the Association for <b>Unmanned</b> Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI). Each year, with a minimal amount of outside {{technical}} assistance, the team develops an AUV to maneuver an underwater obstacle course.|$|E
5|$|The Joint Systems Manufacturing Center in Lima, in {{cooperation}} with General Dynamics, assembles armored combat vehicles, including the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle and M1A2 Abrams tank. Columbus-based Zyvex Performance Materials develops the Piranha <b>Unmanned</b> Surface Vessel. Gravitational Energy Corporation, located in Cuyahoga Falls, proliferates Gravity Assisted Power (GAP) machines {{in cooperation}} with DriPowder, LLC to the military.|$|E
5|$|The MOL {{program was}} {{cancelled}} on 10 June 1969, {{in favour of}} <b>unmanned</b> reconnaissance satellites. Some systems developed for the program were later used on <b>unmanned</b> missions, while the space suits which were under development were transferred to NASA. The Titan IIIM rocket which was to launch MOL never flew, however some of the upgrades that were built into it were later used to upgrade other Titan rockets — the stretched first and second stages became the Titan 34, which {{was used as the}} core of some later Titan IIIB flights, and on the Titan 34D. The seven-segment solid rocket boosters were later introduced on the Titan IVA.|$|E
5|$|The Russian <b>unmanned</b> {{resupply}} spacecraft Progress M1-4 docked to {{the station}} on 18 November. The Progress spacecraft's automatic docking system failed, necessitating a manual docking controlled by Gidzenko using the TORU docking system. Although manual dockings are routine, they have caused some concern among flight controllers since an attempt in 1997 {{which resulted in the}} spacecraft colliding with Mir, causing significant damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} not to restart on-alert bomber missions was also {{a reflection of the}} strategic decline of manned nuclear weapon delivery in favor of <b>unmanned</b> delivery via ICBMs, which had already eclipsed the number of bombers in the United States by April 1964.|$|E
5|$|The dynamic soaring of {{albatrosses}} is inspiring to airplane designers: German {{aerospace engineer}} Johannes Traugott and colleagues have charted the albatross's nuanced flight pattern and {{are looking for}} ways to apply this to aircraft, especially in the area of drones and <b>unmanned</b> aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The first {{component}} of the space station was the Zarya module, which was launched <b>unmanned</b> in November 1998. Following this launch, and prior to Expedition 1, there were five manned Space Shuttle flights and two <b>unmanned</b> Russian flights to the ISS. Some of these flights delivered large modules, such as the pressurized Unity and Zvezda modules, and {{the first piece of}} the Integrated Truss Structure. The manned flights were used for partial assembly of the ISS, as well as to start unpacking the supplies and equipment that were being delivered. Prior to Expedition 1, Krikalev expected the ISS to be very similar to his experience on Mir ten years previous, due to the physical similarities of the stations' components.|$|E
