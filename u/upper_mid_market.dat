40|$|Abstract – The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate {{the effect of the}} transgenic soybean BR- 16 -AHAS genetic constitution on the tolerance to the herbicide imazapyr. BR- 16 -AHAS was crossed with ten other genotypes. The experimental design was a complete randomized block, in a 2 x 12 x 3 factorial arrangement, with two sowing periods (winter and summer), twelve crossing groups and three plant positions (<b>upper,</b> <b>mid</b> and lower), with three replicates. The plants were treated with 100 g ha- 1 a. i. of imazapyr at the V 3 /V 4 stage. For each position of the plant (<b>upper,</b> <b>mid</b> and lower), the following variables were assessed: number of pods, number of seeds, seed weight, number of seeds per pod and the 100 seeds weight. The effect of the herbicide varied according to the more affected plant position (<b>upper,</b> <b>mid</b> and lower) of each genotype. The use of the same gene ahas of BR- 16 -AHAS, in various genotypes, results in materials with good tolerance to imazapyr; tolerance levels depend not only on the ahas gene, but also on the presence of other genes...|$|R

O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar o efeito da constituição genética da soja transgênica BR- 16 -AHAS sobre a tolerância ao herbicida imazapyr. Dez genótipos foram cruzados com BR- 16 -AHAS. O delineamento experimental foi o de blocos completos ao acaso, em esquema fatorial 2 x 12 x 3, com dois períodos de semeadura (inverno e verão), doze grupos de cruzamentos de plantas e três posições (superior, médio e inferior), com três repetições. As plantas foram submetidas ao tratamento com imazapyr, 100 g ha- 1 do i. a., nos estádios V 3 e V 4. Para cada posição da planta (superior, médio e inferior), foram avaliados: número de vagens, número de sementes, peso de sementes, número de sementes por vagem e peso de 100 sementes. Os efeitos do herbicida variaram quanto à posição da planta (alta, média e baixa) mais afetada em cada genótipo.

The upgrading allows for increased energy density onto the stone surface. We targeted 139 ureteral calculi (average diameter 8. 1 mm.) with the {{low pressure}} system. The mean number of shock waves was 7, 308, 9, 226 and 5, 304 for calculi in the <b>upper,</b> <b>mid</b> and lower ureter, respectively, and the energy density corresponded to 0. 222, mJ. /mm. 2, 0. 224 mJ. /mm. 2 and 0. 223 mJ. /mm. 2, respectively. Immediate fragmentation was achieved in 39 of 51 upper (77 %), 21 of 42 mid (50 %) and 22 of 46 lower (49 %) ureteral calculi. The upgraded shock wave tube was used in 52 calculi (average diameter 6. 1 mm.). The mean number of shock waves was 6, 250, 14, 150 and 3, 400 for calculi in the <b>upper,</b> <b>mid</b> and lower ureter, respectively, and the energy density corresponded to 0. 32 mJ. /mm. 2, 0. 33 mJ. /mm. 2 and 0. 30 mJ. /mm. 2, respectively. Immediate fragmentation was achieved in 11 of 16 upper (69 %), 4 of 6 mid (67 %) and 7 of 30 lower (23 %) ureteral calculi.

Cervical lymph node metastases from thoracic esophageal cancer have been considered to be incompatible with curative resection. However, recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} cure is achievable in patients with such metastases. METHODS. Patterns of esophageal cancer metastasis to the cervical nodes and long-term results after tumor resection were investigated in 23 patients undergoing bilateral cervical lymphadenectomy for treatment of thoracic esophageal cancer. RESULTS. The number of positive nodes per patient was significantly greater (p < 0. 05) in lower esophageal cancers (median: 15) than in <b>upper</b> or <b>mid</b> esophageal cancers (median: 2. 5). Simultaneous metastases to three nodal regions (the neck, mediastinum, and abdomen) were significantly more common (p < 0. 001) in lower esophageal tumors (88. 9 %) than in <b>upper</b> and <b>mid</b> esophageal lesions (7. 1 %). Although the overall 5 -year survival rate was 16. 5 %, long-term survival was achieved only in patients with <b>upper</b> or <b>mid</b> esophageal cancer...|$|R
