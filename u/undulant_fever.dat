5|$|The Gram-negative {{bacterial}} disease brucellosis occasionally affects elk in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, {{the only place}} in the U.S. where the disease is still known to exist. In domesticated cattle, brucellosis causes infertility, abortions and reduced milk production. It is transmitted to humans as <b>undulant</b> <b>fever,</b> producing flu-like symptoms which may last for years. Though bison are more likely to transmit the disease to other animals, elk inadvertently transmitted brucellosis to horses in Wyoming and cattle in Idaho. Researchers are attempting to eradicate the disease through vaccinations and herd management measures, which are expected to be successful. Nevetheless, research has been ongoing since 2002, and a successful vaccine has yet to be developed as of 2016.|$|E
2500|$|In 1934, {{commissioned}} {{by a family}} friend, Ellsworth Woodward, Anderson painted an ambitious mural in the auditorium of the Ocean Springs Public School (“Ocean Springs Past and Present”) as part of Public Works of Art Project. Paintings from this period include: [...] "Indians Hunting," [...] "Jockeys Riding Horses," [...] four oil portraits of Sissy, 1933–37, [...] "Black Skimmer," [...] "Androcles and Lion," [...] "Man on Horse," [...] and Birth of Achilles (Memphis Brooks Museum of Art), along with watercolors of flowers, animals, and birds; studies for a projected book on birds of the southeastern U.S.; and linoleum blockprints, including “Tourist Cards”, “Alphabet,” nursery rhymes, “On the River,” “Valkyries,” “Butterfly Book,” and scenes from Shearwater Pottery. Designs for a second mural, in the Jackson, Mississippi Court House, were accepted by an illustrious committee then rejected by a Washington bureaucrat, causing Anderson considerable frustration. This disappointment, coupled {{with the death of}} his father in 1937, lingering bouts of both malaria and <b>undulant</b> <b>fever,</b> and the struggle to eke out a living with work he detested (manufacturing figurines) led to a mental breakdown, with psychotic episodes, in 1937.|$|E
2500|$|From 1938 to 1940 Walter Anderson {{was in and}} out {{of mental}} hospitals, {{including}} the Henry Phipps Psychiatric Clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital, Sheppard Pratt, and the Mississippi State Hospital at Whitfield. At Phipps, where he spent 18 months, treated attentively by Adolf Meyer and a team of psychiatrists, he was diagnosed with severe depression ("hypothymergasia") with paranoid trends and schizophrenic ("parergasic") features. At Sheppard Pratt, the diagnosis was schizophrenia. [...] Despite periods of psychosis and brief hospitalization in the 1950s, he led a life more productive than most, and a definitive diagnosis eluded physicians, although psychiatrist Paul Rodenhauser, who writes about Walter Anderson's creativity in relation to his mental illness, ventures a possible posthumous diagnosis: [...] "schizo-affective disorder, bipolar type" [...] (see [...] "Alternative Reality and Art: The Creative World of Walter Inglis Anderson," [...] available through Project Muse.) [...] For others, recurring symptoms of malaria and <b>undulant</b> <b>fever</b> explain Anderson's depression and the apparent [...] "fugue states" [...] that occasionally accompanied it during this two-year period. Although lifelong mental illness has been suggested by some authors, others argue that there is no convincing evidence of mental problems either before or after the 1938-1940 period, and attribute psychotic episodes in the 1950s—for which he was, again, hospitalized—to the effects of alcoholism. Anderson was extremely productive and creative throughout his life. Even at Sheppard Pratt and later at Whitfield, he was well enough to draw, read, and plot elaborate escapes. After eloping from Sheppard Pratt, he walked 1,000 miles (1,600km) from Baltimore to Ocean Springs. During one of several escapes from the Mississippi State Hospital, he lowered himself on bedsheets from a second-story window, leaving the brick walls festooned with drawings of birds in flight, done in soap.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} stage of the disease, sepsis occurs and leads to the classic triad of <b>undulant</b> <b>fevers,</b> {{sweating}} (often with characteristic foul moldy smell sometimes likened to wet hay), and migratory arthralgia and myalgia (joint and muscle pain). Blood tests characteristically reveal a low number of white blood cells and red blood cells, show some elevation of liver enzymes such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and demonstrate positive Bengal Rose and Huddleston reactions. Gastrointestinal symptoms occur in 70% of cases and include nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, unintentional weight loss, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, an enlarged liver, liver inflammation, liver abscess, and an enlarged spleen.|$|R

50|$|Alice Catherine Evans (January 29, 1881 - September 5, 1975) was an American microbiologist. She {{became a}} {{researcher}} at the US Department of Agriculture.

50|$|Bernhard Lauritz Frederik Bang (7 June 1848 - 22 June 1932), was a Danish veterinarian. He {{discovered}} Brucella abortus in 1897, {{which came}} to be known as Bang's bacillus.

50|$|She was {{met with}} skepticism, {{particularly}} {{because she was a}} woman and did not have a Ph.D. She warned that raw milk should be pasteurized to protect people from various diseases. During the 1920s, scientists around the world made the same findings, and eventually, Brucella was confirmed as the disease that caused what was then known as <b>undulant</b> <b>fever</b> and Malta fever. Her findings led to the pasteurization of milk in 1930. As a result, the incidence of brucellosis in the United States was significantly reduced.|$|E
50|$|Walker {{believed}} that dairy products especially had a deleterious effect on human health. He {{testified to the}} disappearance of many ailments upon the exclusion of dairy products. He explained that pathogenic organisms find an ideal breeding ground in the excess mucus that dairy products generate.

5000|$|The Widal test, {{developed}} in 1896 and named after its inventor, Georges-Fernand Widal, is a presumptive serological test for enteric fever or <b>undulant</b> <b>fever</b> whereby bacteria causing typhoid and malaria fever {{are mixed with}} a serum containing specific antibodies obtained from an infected individual. In cases of Salmonella infection, it is {{a demonstration of the}} presence of O-soma false-positive result. Test results need to be interpreted carefully to account for any history of enteric fever, typhoid vaccination, and the general level of antibodies in the populations in endemic areas of the world. Typhidot is the other test used to ascertain the diagnosis of typhoid fever. As with all serological tests, the rise in antibody levels needed to perform the diagnosis takes 7 - 14 days, which limits its applicability in early diagnosis. Other means of diagnosing Salmonella typhi (and paratyphi) include cultures of blood, urine and faeces. These organisms produce H2S from thiosulfate and can be identified easily on differential media such as bismuth sulfite agar.|$|E

50|$|The story {{involves}} Asbury, {{a writer}} from New York who returns {{home to his}} mother's farm in the South after being diagnosed with a serious illness. He is out of money, unsuccessful and believes he is dying. His mother finds a local doctor who draws some of Asbury's blood to examine. In bed Asbury thinks about various experiences, including one the prior year when he interacted with the African-American farm hands and, {{in a show of}} rebellion against his mother, smoked with them in the dairy barn. However, the hands refused to drink some of the milk as Asbury did. Asbury requests that his mother bring a priest to him against her wishes. She eventually complies but the priest is elderly, hard of hearing, and not the intellectual that Asbury hoped for. Asbury then requests to see the African-American farm hands and gives them cigarettes. The farm hands lie to him and tell him he looks well. Asbury finds this interaction disappointing. Later, Asbury is informed that he has <b>undulant</b> <b>fever,</b> probably from drinking raw milk. The illness will not kill him but will continually recur and cause him pain. Asbury is disappointed that he will not die a tragic death.|$|E

5000|$|Dickinson's Self-Portrait of 1949 {{differs from}} his others {{in being a}} profile portrait, {{achieved}} {{by the use of}} two mirrors. It was painted to give to the National Academy of Design as a condition of his admission to associate membership, and its character reflects that purpose. [...] Ward suggests that Dickinson presents himself as an academician, the profile view indicative of the timeless essence of the man, with a perspective diagram behind him demonstrating command of the rules of pictorial space construction, and his arm raised {{in the creation of the}} picture in which he appears (uniquely among his self-portraits). [...] But small patches of paint destabilize depicted surfaces as if to suggest that the perceived world is in continuous flux as the mind structures shifting perceptions. Self-Portrait, 1950, is a remnant of a half-length, nude self-portrait that once included a vase he cut out and gave to the National Academy of Design when they granted him full membership. [...] The frontal head, dramatically lit, partially obscured by a shingle, with mouth open as if speaking, beard windswept, furrowed brow, and with a body seemingly confined, appears overpowered by circumstances beyond his control. No events in his life can be related with certainty to the expressive effect of this picture, but a notation in his journal links a life-threatening fall of his aged father to concerns about his own changing condition. [...] These concerns were realized in 1953, when Dickinson spent most of the summer in the hospital, where he was operated on for an abscess followed by a bout with <b>undulant</b> <b>fever.</b> His wife was operated on in January 1954, and three weeks later and three days before the anniversary of his brother's death, he began his last Self-Portrait. [...] As in the portrait of 1950, his arms appear confined, but in place of the flashing eye and teeth in the earlier work these openings are shown as dark holes, and a heavy ledge appears to bear down on his head. The image is of a heroic figure suffering anguish and defeat.|$|E
