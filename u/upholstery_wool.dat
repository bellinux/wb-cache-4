500|$|Mammal skins provide leather for shoes, {{clothing}} and <b>upholstery.</b> <b>Wool</b> from mammals including sheep, goats and alpacas {{has been used}} for centuries for clothing. Mammals serve a major role in science as experimental animals, both in fundamental biological research, such as in genetics, and in the development of new medicines, which must be tested exhaustively to demonstrate their safety. Millions of mammals, especially mice and rats, are used in experiments each year. A knockout mouse is a genetically modified mouse with an inactivated gene, replaced or disrupted [...] with an artificial piece of DNA. They enable the study of sequenced genes whose functions are unknown. A small percentage of the mammals are non-human primates, used in research for their similarity to humans.|$|E

The two center rear seats are folding type for security personnel. In between the center seats is a beverage bar. The rear seats were covered in supple 100% <b>wool</b> <b>upholstery,</b> while the driver has leather seats.

5000|$|A fire {{broke out}} in the factory in March 1914 causing US$600,000 (US$ {{adjusted}} for inflation). In 1917, the plant reported a US$700,000 (US$ adjusted for inflation) profit. Several orders came in that year from automobile manufacturers who were using <b>wool</b> <b>upholstery</b> in their vehicles. [...] The rebuilding began {{a few days after the}} disaster. During World War I, the Portland Woolen Mills were contracted to manufacture clothing and blankets for the United States Armed Forces. They also bid on contracts for Russian soldiers on the Eastern Front. When the war was dying down, production at the plant dropped after demand started to curtail. After failing to meet increasing demand in 1919, the woolen mills added 150 new employees to rectify the issue.|$|R
40|$|Unconventional {{textiles}} can {{be obtained}} by strengthening the fibrous layer using wires, thereby achieving auxiliary materials for clothing, apparel linings, carpets. The fiber layers can be reinforced backing fabric using mechanical or mixed methods. The products are designed as filter materials, basic clothing. The global market for raw materials there is a continuing concern for material recovery specialists and their reintroduction into the economic cycle. Reconsideration materials as technological losses in production processes and in the sphere of consumption as factors polunaţi environment {{on the one hand and}} as a source of raw materials and energy, on the other hand, gave rise to different views regarding society's attitudes also potential resources and practical concepts that operate in these areas are unforgettable. Researches in order to create new unconventional textile fiber content of recyclable materials recovered were considered objectives: -The establishment of new <b>wool</b> <b>upholstery</b> variants which besides reusable textile fibers recovered to be entered and recovered fiber in textile products -Make per-lightweight textile per unit area that could be used in land drainage works on clay as filter elements covering plastic tubes. ...|$|R
50|$|Domestic mammals form a {{large part}} of the {{livestock}} raised for meat across the world. They include (2011) around 1.4 billion cattle, 1.2 billion sheep, 1 billion domestic pigs, and (1985) over 700 million rabbits. Working domestic animals including cattle and horses have been used for work and transport from the origins of agriculture, their numbers declining with the arrival of mechanised transport and agricultural machinery. In 2004 they still provided some 80% of the power for the mainly small farms in the third world, and some 20% of the world's transport, again mainly in rural areas. In mountainous regions unsuitable for wheeled vehicles, pack animals continue to transport goods.Mammal skins provide leather for shoes, clothing and <b>upholstery.</b> <b>Wool</b> from mammals including sheep, goats and alpacas has been used for centuries for clothing.

50|$|The Bastian {{chair was}} {{manufactured}} {{with and without}} armrests, its frame was mainly made in beech wood with leatherette and <b>wool</b> <b>upholstery</b> or bare wood veneer. The chair was stackable and well suited for assembly halls, meeting rooms, offices and receptions areas. Haug was personally convinced that quality and durability would win him sales, so all his chair designs underwent a thorough durability test at the Norwegian Institute of Wood Technology. All chairs produced by Haug scored the highest rankings for durability, quality and construction methods. This explains the enormous success the Bastian series enjoyed and the employment it created in Elverum. As {{what might have been}} the best warranty scheme in the business, each chair was dated underneath and sold with a 10 year warranty! Today, almost 60 years after one can find Bastian chairs and the ‘36’ chair in excellent condition to both frame structure and upholstery. The story goes that Olav Haug met executives and buyers either at his office or their headquarters and that Haug guaranteed the quality of his products by throwing the chairs through the window. This clearly impressed buyers and the method won him numerous new orders. It was with this method that he secured a large order for Bastian chairs for the newly built Ulleval Hospital in Oslo.|$|R
