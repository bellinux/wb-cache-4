6000|$|... 55. We {{could have}} wished that Lord Lindsay had further insisted on {{what will be}} {{found to be a}} {{characteristic}} of all the truly Christian or spiritual, as opposed to classical, schools of sculpture--the scenic or painter-like management of effect. The marble is not cut into the actual form of the thing imaged, but oftener into a perspective suggestion of it--the bas-reliefs sometimes almost entirely <b>under</b> <b>cut,</b> and sharpedged, so as to come clear off a dark ground of shadow; even heads the size of life being in this way rather shadowed out than carved out, as the Madonna of Benedetto de Majano in Santa Maria Novella, one of the cheeks being advanced half an inch out of its proper place--and often the most audacious violations of proportion admitted, as in the limbs of Michael Angelo's sitting Madonna in the Uffizii; all artifices, also, of deep and sharp cutting being allowed, to gain the shadowy and spectral expressions about the brow and lip which the mere actualities of form could not have conveyed;--the sculptor never following a material model, but feeling after the most momentary and subtle aspects of the countenance--striking these out sometimes suddenly, by rude chiseling, and stopping the instant they are attained--never risking the loss of thought by the finishing of flesh surface. The heads of the Medici sacristy we believe to have been thus left unfinished, as having already the utmost expression which the marble could receive, and incapable of anything but loss from further touches. So with Mino da Fiesole and Jacopo della Quercia, the workmanship is often hard, sketchy, and angular, having its full effect only at a little distance; but at that distance the statue becomes ineffably alive, even to startling, bearing an aspect of change and uncertainty, as if it were about to vanish, and withal having a light, and sweetness, and incense of passion upon it that silences the looker-on, half in delight, half in expectation. This daring stroke--this transfiguring tenderness--may be shown to characterize all truly Christian sculpture, as compared with the antique, or the pseudo-classical of subsequent periods. We agree with Lord Lindsay in thinking the Psyche of Naples the nearest approach to the Christian ideal of all ancient efforts; but even in this the approximation is more accidental than real--a fair type of feature, further exalted by the mode in which the imagination supplies the lost upper folds of the hair. The fountain of life and emotion remains sealed; nor was the opening of that fountain due to any study of the far less pure examples accessible by the Pisan sculptors. The sound of its waters had been heard long before in the aisles of the Lombard; nor was it by Ghiberti, still less by Donatello, that the bed of that Jordan was dug deepest, but by Michael Angelo (the last heir of the Byzantine traditions descending through Orcagna), opening thenceforward through thickets darker and more dark, and with waves ever more soundless and slow, into the Dead Sea wherein its waters have been stayed.|$|E

5000|$|Bouts usually {{continue}} until one fighter {{is struck by}} an [...] "incapacitating" [...] blow or otherwise becomes disinclined to continue.

An [...] "incapacitating" [...] blow is defined as a valid attack to the head, neck, torso, armpit or inner groin area. Attacks to the legs or arms are considered [...] "disabling". A hit to the arm disables that arm, which is held behind the fencer's back or hanging limply at their side. Fencers whose sword arm is disabled can switch hands. Some kingdoms use rules with additional details for strikes to the hand, which may simply disable the hand (represented by making a fist) or apply to the whole arm. For a strike to the leg or foot, the fencer can continue fighting but must kneel, sit on the ground, or balance on one leg. <b>Under</b> <b>Cut</b> and Thrust rules, hits to the leg or foot are considered incapacitating. Many kingdoms contain additional clarifications of these rules, such as only permitting sitting on the ground when the leg is hit, and/or limiting the permitted angle of approach for the opponent while seated (to avoid unsafe strikes to the back).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Springback or shape {{change has}} been one of the major {{challenges}} in sheet metal fabrication, particularly with increase application of high strength steel (HSS) and aluminum alloys in automotive stamping. Springback, an elastic material recovery after the unloading of stamping tools, causes variations and inconsistencies of final part dimensions. Minor or mild springback usually can be corrected in the re-strike process. Excessive springback must be corrected so the part will be produced within the given design tolerance and dimension. The commonly used Spring Forward approaches and shape compensations such as over-crown and over-bending are proven effective to alleviate excessive springback. To enhance these approaches, a new strategy of Die Face Engineering (DFE) based processing is proposed to quickly and easily to achieve the maximum allowable compensation using the <b>under</b> <b>cut</b> (or die lock) as the primary criteria. The implementation of the die face compensation through iterative FEA calculation, automatic surface mapping, projection and manual morphing are crucial to meet production environment requirements in terms of generating NC quality CAD surfaces of the compensated or morphed die face. In this paper, the strategy of the die face compensation with the consideration of the <b>under</b> <b>cut</b> criteria is presented. The implementation of various processes to enable user to perform the die face compensation task in a production environment is also discussed. Finally, two examples are shown to demonstrate the implementation of the proposed springback compensation scheme based on the combined CAE/CAD methodology...|$|E

40|$|The damaged/failed {{compressor}} stator and rotor blades of an aeroengine were analyzed. All the blades {{were found to}} have failed by fatigue. The fatigue cracks in the stator blades have initiated at the <b>under</b> <b>cut</b> of the leading edge hub.

In the case of rotor blades, fatigue cracks initiated from either side of the airfoil with multiple origins and propagated to form through thickness cracks. No metallurgical abnormalities were responsible for fatigue crack initiation and hence fatigue appears to be stress related. Evidences suggest that tip rubbing with the casing would have caused excessive bending stresses on the blade resulting in fatigue crack initiation. ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to examine the {{justification}} of forming active prosthetic segments on the abutment teeth for the incline of the elements of removable partial denture. Methods. The investigation was performed during 3 -years observational period, at the Prosthodontic Clinics of Belgrade University Dental School, and the Military Medical Academy (MMA). During the mentioned observation period two groups of 200 patients with different kinds of edentulousness were analyzed, indicated for the design of metal frame removable partial dentures (MFRPD) with cast clasps. A total of 400 patients represented 50 % of the sample chosen by random choice method for the determined observational period and dental institutions. Results. The evaluation of justification of the abutment teeth preparation was done during the analysis of the requirement of forming: guide planes, planes for occlusal rests, vestibular <b>under</b> <b>cut,</b> oral <b>under</b> <b>cut.</b> Conclusion. Upon the evaluation of the performed analyses the following can be concluded: during the composition of every MFRPD it is necessary to use at least two or more guide planes, depending on the type edentulousness of patients' teeth; formation of guide planes is performed in excessively high number of the abutment teeth (over 95 %); during the composition of each particular MFRDP it is necessary to use as more occlusal rests as possible, at least 3, or more, which also depends on the type of patients' edentulousness; composition of the planes for occlusal rest has to be performed in almost all the patients (over 95 % of the abutment teeth); vestibular planes of the abutment teeth should be prepared in over 50 % of the used teeth; oral planes are prepared within the preparation of the abutment teeth for other active prosthetic segments. Conclusion. It is necessary to perform the composition of active prosthetic segments according to the plan established for the study models, both if the preparation of teeth for the adoption of MFRDP elements with clasps represents the use of an uninvasive, or an invasive dental method...|$|E

We shall focus in particular on the following two topics: - The Temperley-Lieb algebra has always hitherto been presented as a quotient of some sort: either algebraically by generators and relations as in Jones' original presentation, or as a diagram algebra modulo planar isotopy as in Kauffman's presentation. We shall use tools from Geometry of Interaction, a dynamical interpretation of proofs <b>under</b> <b>Cut</b> Elimination developed as an off-shoot of Linear Logic, to give a direct description of the Temperley-Lieb category [...] a "fully abstract presentation", in Computer Science terminology. This also brings something new to the Geometry of Interaction, since we are led to develop a planar version of it, and to verify that the interpretation of Cut-Elimination (the "Execution Formula", or "composition by feedback") preserves planarity. - We shall also show how the Temperley-Lieb algebra provides a natural setting in which computation can be performed diagrammatically as geometric simplification [...] "yanking lines straight". We shall introduce a "planar lambda-calculus" for this purpose, and show how it can be interpreted in the Temperley-Lieb category. Comment: 45 page...|$|E

The effect of test drugs was evaluated in relation to these changes. Oral administration of 12. 5 mg/kg P- 10 was quite effective in alleviating the inflammatory signs. Indomethacin (5 mg/kg, p. o.) was slightly less effective, but significantly effective. In all cases of indomethacin administration, mucous diarrhoea was observed, and in some cases a visible amout of blood was mixed in the stool. No such sign was noted with P- 10.

We hypothesized lean CKD increase the CVD risk, contributing different factors from obese. 2, 676 CKD patients recruited from 11 outpatients’ hospitals.

Patients were divided by BMI <b>under</b> <b>cut</b> off value of normal, thus 7 % grouped in lean subjects (BMI < 18. 5). Systolic blood pressure (sBP), albumin, hemoglobin, age and prevalence of diabetes were lower in lean BMI group compared to other subjects.

The lean BMI increased significantly the risk of CVD mortality, in spite of low prevalence of comorbidities and young age in unadjusted model (HR 2. 38, 95 %CI 1. 49 - 5. 21, p< 0. 01).
