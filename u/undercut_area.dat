40|$|In making {{removable}} denture, {{some aspects}} must be considered: retention, stabilization, support, comfort, and aesthetic. Retention {{plays an important}} role in the success of a removable denture. Retention can be obtained from the <b>undercut</b> <b>area,</b> or friction of the denture’s components to the abutment or abutment. Clasp as a retainer, both of metal casting and wire have been frequently used in the removable partial denture. The clasp has some shortcomings in its using, namely color of the metal can sometimes interfere with the aesthetic of the wearer and cannot be placed on teeth that have experienced extensive caries. Telescopic crown as retainer has several advantages, which can be used on crown of abutment that has experienced extensive caries or tooth that will be an abutment but have endodontic-treated. On telescopic crowns, retention is obtained from the friction between the primary crowns against secondary crown that serves as a retainer. This case report describes two cases of a removable denture with a metal framework using a telescopic crown on one tooth that serves as a retainer in the case of one-side free-end edentulous...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Adequate {{preparation}} of abutment teeth for removable partial denture (RPD) rest seats allows appropriate masticatory force transmission, retention, {{and stability of}} supporting structures. It follows that careful preparation will be important for the longevity of the rehabilitation. The present study aimed to clinically evaluate rest seats and <b>undercut</b> <b>areas</b> of abutment teeth in RPD wearers after 2 years of use. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 193 occlusal, incisal, and cingulum rest seats were evaluated in terms of shape, rest adaptation, wear, caries, fractures, and surface type (enamel, composite resin, or amalgam). Two hundred and fourteen <b>undercut</b> <b>areas</b> were evaluated in terms of surface type (enamel or restoration) and integrity. This study {{was approved by the}} Research Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, resolution 196 / 1996, protocol number 11 / 05. RESULTS: Intact preparations accounted for 92. 2 % of the total. Application of the Pearson test (p= 0. 289) found no statistically significant differences among the materials on which the rest seats were prepared. For the <b>undercut</b> <b>areas,</b> 20. 7 % of those obtained on restorative material were nonintact. In addition, Fisher's exact test showed a statistically significant difference (p= 0. 001) in surface type; enamel surfaces were shown to be 14 times more stable than restored surfaces.

40|$|One of the {{important}} parameters in undercut slopes design is {{the determination of the}} maximum stable undercut span. The maximum stable undercut span is a function of slope geometry, the strength parameters of the slope material, condition of discontinuities, underground water condition, etc. However, the desired production capacity and therefore the size of excavating equipment will sometimes ask for a wider undercut span. The influence of arching phenomenon in geo-material on the stability of undercut slopes is investigated earlier. It is believed that due to arching effect, some load transfer from the <b>undercut</b> <b>area</b> into stationary remaining side toes leads to a more stable slope. However, the transferred load may result in ploughing failure of side toes. One technique for preventing the ploughing failure is the use of counterweight balance on side toes. In this study, the influence of counterweight size on the stability of the undercut slopes was investigated through a series of numerical model tests using FLAC 3 D software. It was concluded that there is a meaningful relationship between the counterweight balance size and the maximum stable undercut span where increasing a counterweight size results in a wider stable span. Finally, the numerical results were compared with pre-conducted physical modeling test and a nonlinear relationship was proposed between the counterweight size and the maximum stable undercut span...|$|E
40|$|PS 304 {{is a high}} {{temperature}} solid lubricant coating comprised of a nickel-chrome binder, chrome oxide hardener, barium-calcium fluoride {{high temperature}} lubricant, and silver as the low temperature lubricant. This coating is used to lubricate Oil-Free Foil Air Bearings as they experience friction and wear during start up and shut down. The coating deposition process begins with undercutting the shaft. This area is then sandblasted to provide a rough surface for the coating to adhere to. The coating powder is then sent through the plasma spray gun and a reasonably thick layer {{is applied to the}} <b>undercut</b> <b>area</b> of the shaft. The coating is then ground down even with the surface of the shaft and gets a nice polished finish. The foil air bearings use the solid lubricant, as mentioned above, during start up and shut down. During normal operating conditions, generally above 2000 RPM, the bearings utilize air as their lubricant. Foil air bearings are comprised of a thin top foil and a corrugated bump foil. They have an interference fit with the shaft before operation. As the air gets "trapped" between the top foil and the shaft, it presses the top foil against the bump foil, in turn compressing the bumps. As the bumps compress, it allows for the air to separate the top foil from the shaft, therefore, utilizing the trapped air as its lubricant...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of lightweight materials increases {{in all aspects}} of manufacturing, e. g. automotive, sports equipment and aerospace [1]. Making fiber reinforced plastics suitable for use in mass production new technologies have to be developed to overcome existing challenges e. g. shorter cycle times or more efficient resource usage. Innovative laser systems are used for a full range of treatments for all materials, like structuring, drilling, joining and cutting [2] - [4]. This paper presents laser processes for surface treatment of fiber reinforced plastics and their potentials to improve adhesive bonding, molding processes and coating deposition. Pulsed laser ablation is offering a promising alternative to state of the art mechanical milling for material removal. The most important advantages of the laser are: non-contact processes, no tool wear, design flexibility and no need for post treatments. Especially selective matrix removal that exposes the reinforcing fibers without damaging them (as shown in figure 1) is a unique characteristic that only laser treatment can offer. This structure exhibits a surface enlargement, enables form lock and offers an <b>undercut</b> <b>area</b> over 100 μm depth. As a consequence ten times higher tensile strength is reached in pull-off tests compared to untreated surfaces. The laser structured organic sheet was injection molded with the matrix polymer on top of the structured zone. The next step will be the transfer of developments into industry to further improve the process. Laser based surface pre-treatment will be used to apply e. g. rip structures on semi-finished organic sheets and laser ablated cavities will be exerted to integrate inserts or sensors on fiber-reinforced plastic...|$|E

RESULTS: Cuspal reduction was generally inadequate for the ceramometal crowns, and central fossa reduction was insufficient for both complete gold crowns and ceramometal crowns. The facial shoulder widths were also generally underprepared for the ceramometal crowns.

40|$|Objective: Ceramic inlays are {{bonded to}} tooth {{structure}} with resin cements. During the resin cement setting, shrinkage stress develops at the interfaces. During tooth preparation, the <b>undercut</b> <b>areas</b> formed {{due to the}} different patterns of caries progression can either be blocked out before taking impression with suitable cement such as glass ionomer cement, or before making the final restoration in the laboratory. Then, the relieved space will be filled with luting cement in clinic. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare these two methods of undercut filling in term of stress distribution in the ceramic inlay. Materials and Methods: An axisymmetric finite element analysis was performed to study the stress distribution during inlay cementing. The solid model was generated from a longitudinal section of maxillary premolar in which a class I cavity with 60 degree undercut at the preparation wall and 20 degree divergence of the vertical walls was prepared. A thermal model was used to simulate the polymerization shrinkage of the resin cement. Finite element analysis was carried out in ANSYS environment. Results: Filling the undercut by glass ionomer cement decreased the stress concentration at the ceramic/cement interface. The dominant normal stress at the tooth cement interface in absence of glass ionomer cement was tensile with maximum of 30 Mpa. Using glass ionomer, cement developed stresses with different compressive and tensile signs. With increasing the thickness of resin cement (100 µm, 150 µm, 200 µm), the stress increased. Conclusion: Cements with minimum shrinkage and as thin layer as possible should be used. Filling the undercut with glass ionomer cement decreases the stress.

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} occurrence and characteristics of undercut streambanks in forested headwater streams of the Oregon Coast Range. Undercut streambanks and associated reach characteristics were surveyed along 46 sample reaches (each 152 m in length) in 8 streams; all sample reaches occurred in unmanaged forested riparian areas. Drainage areas ranged from 0. 3 to 16. 6 km^ 2. At each undercut location length, surface area, volume, low-flow (summertime) volume, and maximum horizontal depth were measured. Individual <b>undercuts</b> had surface <b>areas</b> ranging from 0. 3 to 27. 7 m^ 2 with a mean value of 2. 6 m^ 2, and lengths ranging from 1. 2 to 15. 2 m with a mean value of 5. 0 m. The <b>area</b> <b>undercut</b> streambanks ranged from 0. 0 to 27. 4 m^ 2 / 100 m of stream, with an average value of 6. 5 m^ 2 / 100 m. The proportion of bankfull channel <b>area</b> <b>undercut</b> ranged from 0. 0 to 4. 5 %, with an average value of 1. 1 %. Reach length undercut ranged from 0. 0 to 23. 6 %, with an average value of 6. 2 %. The values reported {{in this study are}} approximately mid-range in comparison to characteristics of undercut banks reported in studies from Alaska, Montana, and Wisconsin. The % of reach <b>area</b> covered by <b>undercut</b> streambanks in this study is approximately half of that provided by large woody debris. Outside channel bends had approximately 6 times more undercut streambanks than inside bends or straight sections. Streams having a sinuosity index greater than 1. 15 averaged approximately twice as much % surface <b>area</b> <b>undercut</b> than streams having a sinuosity index less than 1. 15. Number of undercuts and undercut characteristics were inversely correlated with channel gradient; significant differences occurring among 1 %, 2 - 4 %, and 5 +% channel gradient classes. Streambanks ranging in height from 1 - 2 m had a higher occurrence of undercut streambanks than either lower or higher streambanks. Undercut streambanks were 4 times more common in "composite" than "non-composite" streambanks. Undercut characteristics appear to be correlated with valley segment type. Channel widths were, on average, significantly narrower at undercut sites when compared to reach average channel widths. However, it does not appear than width characteristics are a cause of undercutting. Based on field observations it appears that flow obstructions (gravel bars, boulders, large woody debris) have little impact on undercut characteristics. Both at-a-site and reach-level comparisons of undercut bank characteristics showed relatively strong correlations with streamside tree densities. Red alder (Alnus rubra) is the most prevalent species found in Coast Range riparian areas, and the most significant species in explaining reach-level differences in undercut characteristics. Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) is less common in riparian zones, but appears to be positively correlated with the proportion of reach <b>area</b> <b>undercut...</b>|$|R

During the summer of 2011 students and faculty from the UNM Water Resources Program conducted {{an investigation of the}} Rito Peñas Negras in the Cuba District of the Santa Fe National Forest. The objective was to conduct an assessment of the stream and determine its characteristics, quality, and ability to meet its designated use of supporting high quality coldwater aquatic life. The Rito Peñas Negras is a small first order stream with a total length of 7. 9 miles. It has one tributary, the Rito Café, which adds another 4 miles to its length. The watershed consists of 10, 850 acres and ranges in elevation from approximately 8, 500 ft to 9, 000 ft. The lower reaches of the stream are the subject of a watershed restoration project by the WildEarth Guardians that consists of constructing animal exclosures and re-establishing riparian vegetation. The results of this study may serve as a baseline for future evaluation of the success of this restoration effort. This project included a formal assessment of the stream at five locations along its length. These assessments included measurement of flow, water quality, stream geomorphology, and field identification of benthic macroinvertebrates. Additional measurements of flow and/or water quality were done at three other sites in watershed and three sites along the Rio de las Vacas. An intensive investigation of the stream was conducted during the second week of June, while a follow up study on August 15, 2011 was limited to flow measurements and collection of water quality samples at three locations. Flow in the Rito Peñas Negras in June ranged from about 0. 25 cfs in the upper reaches to 0. 16 cfs in the lower reaches. Streamflow in August ranged from. 52 to 1. 04 cfs which was due to summer rains. Measurements of electrical conductivity and the stable isotopes deuterium and oxygen- 18 suggest that the decrease in flow is the result of both evaporation and infiltration. During both sampling trips the stream was flowing well below bankfull conditions which was attributed to a dry winter, however, the lower reach showed evidence of a recent very high flow event due to a summer thunderstorm in August. The water quality of the stream was found to be very high during the June study. Nutrient concentrations (nitrogen and phosphorous) were low and no measurable chlorophyll a was detected in the water, though small attached algal growth was noted on bottom sediments. Thermograph measurements over the preceding month exhibited a strong diurnal fluctuation superimposed on an increasing trend associated with on-set of summer. Field characterization of benthic macroinvertebrate populations also supported the conclusion of high quality water in the stream. Stream samples collected in August found moderate concentrations of nitrate which was attributed to cattle grazing that began about June 1. The upper reaches of the watershed is steeper hence the stream was dominated by riffles and glide areas. The stream bed consisted mostly of sands and gravels and there was good canopy of riparian vegetation. Lower reaches were flatter and flow was primarily a mix of shallow pools and glide areas. Stream banks were generally stable with extensive <b>undercut</b> <b>areas</b> for fish refuge, however, there was virtually no woody riparian vegetation below FR 527.

Bottom fishes and habitat characteristics on ledges were surveyed at a study site located centrally in the southeastern USA continental shelf. Species richness, diversity, abundance, and biomass of fish were higher at ledges than on flat bottom. Species richness, abundance, and biomass of fish were well explained by ledge variables including percent cover of sessile invertebrates, total height, and height of undercut recesses. Multivariate analyses based on biomass of individual species at ledges revealed two fish assemblages associated with four ledge types.

The {{objective of the}} work was to evaluate the generative techniques 3 D-printing (3 DP) and Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) concerning their potentials for fabrication of individual and complex shaped bioactive implants based on hydroxyapatite (HAP). At 3 DP the ceramic part is generated layer wise from a powder bed. Via a printing head a liquid {{is added to the}} powder which is specific solidified by the reaction between powder, liquid and binder. The binder can be contained both in the printing liquid or in the powder bed. A special system powder/ binder/ liquid was developed for 3 DP of HAP. With this system HAP-components were generated, for example cuboids with channels (diameter  1 mm) in all three directions in space and fragments of the human mandible as demonstrator parts. After sintering the HAP-components with micro- and macro-porosity are qualified for application as implants. The results verify the performance of 3 DP for the fabrication of complex three-dimensional hydroxyapatite structures which can be applied as bioactive implants. This powder printing technique is applicably also to other calciumphosphates (e. g. tri-calciumphosphate). In the case of SLS the conventional sintering step as post-proce ssing after the generation of the component can be omitted. However pure HAP-powder could not be consolidated via direct SLS process. Therefore several approaches to indirect laser sintering of HAP were investigated, such as using of inorganic and organic additives. Also other RP techniques like stereolithography or robocasting offer high potentials with respect to the generation of ceramic implants...|$|R
50|$|Visitors {{learn about}} {{all aspects of}} the modern-day mining process, as well as earlier procedures, through this three-part gallery. In the <b>Undercut</b> and drill <b>area,</b> the mine is set up for the first phase of a blast. An {{undercutter}} is used to cut a slot {{at the base of the}} rock, making it possible for the salt to drop. In this phase, a series of carefully sited holes are drilled into the salt wall.The next pillar of the Mining Gallery is the blast area, which illustrates how the room being mined is wired with explosives. On display is a powder car. It was formerly a drill, but was modified underground as a powder car and carried all the tools and materials needed to powder a room, including the explosives and wire.The third phase of the mining process featured is the Load Area. Miners used the Joy Loader on display from the 1940s until 1983 when the rail system was discontinued. Named for its manufacturer, the Joy Loader increased efficiency by eliminating the need to hand-load ore cars. This large piece of equipment, as so many others, was brought down the shaft in pieces and welded back together underground. Once a piece of equipment is underground, it remains. When equipment finally outlives its usefulness, it is usually abandoned in an area already mined.The shuttle featured in this gallery was also used from the 1940s until 1983 to take salt from the mine face to the loading station at the main rail line. Powered by a DC extension cord, the car reduced labor and increased efficiency because miners no longer had to lay rails to get the salt from the blast site to the main rail lines.|$|R
40|$|Extensive ice-cored moraine {{complexes}} {{are common}} elements, marking the last advance of many Svalbard glaciers. Sediment gravity flows {{are among the}} most dynamic processes, transforming these landforms. The short-term (yearly and weekly) dynamics of mass-wasting processes were studied in a cm-scale using repetitive topographic scanning. We monitored several active sites on the forelands of two glaciers, Ebbabreen and Ragnarbreen, both of which are located near Petuniabukta at the northern end of Billefjorden in Spitsbergen. The surveys indicate high dynamic rates of landforms' transformation. The mean annual volume loss of sediments and dead-ice for the most active parts of the moraines was up to 1. 8 m a− 1. However, most of the transformation occurred during summer, with the short-term values of mean elevation changes as high as − 104 mm day− 1. In comparison, the dynamics of the other (i. e. non-active) parts of the ice-cored moraines were much lower, namely, the mean annual lowering (attributed mainly to dead-ice downwasting) was up to 0. 3 m a − 1, whereas lowering during summer was up to 8 mm day− 1. Our results indicate {{that in the case of}} the studied glaciers, backwasting was much more effective than downwasting in terms of landscape transformation in the glacier forelands. However, despite the high activity of localised mass movement processes, the overall short-term dynamics of ice-cored moraines for the studied glaciers were relatively low. We suggest that as long as debris cover is sufficiently thick (thicker than the permafrost's active layer depths), the mass movement activity would occur only under specific topographic conditions and/or due to occurrence of external meltwater sources and slope <b>undercutting.</b> In other <b>areas,</b> ice-cored moraines remain a stable landsystem component in a yearly to decadal time-scale.

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 Several {{streams in}} the mixed conifer cover type of the Ochoco and Blue Mountains of central Oregon were studied to {{determine}} what effects selective harvesting of the riparian timber stand had on the amounts and distribution of coarse woody debris (CWD) in the stream. Pristine streams were measured to develop a data base for the streams of the region. Watersheds that had experienced harvests from 12 to 60 years ago which had from 22 to 93 percent of the basal area removed were then measured {{to determine the effects}} of selective harvesting. CWD volumes were computed for all pieces greater than 10 centimeters in diameter at the small end, and at least 1 meter in length. Each piece was classified according to source, association with other debris, age, species, and overall characteristics. No statistical difference could be found in the total volume of CWD when comparing the managed to the pristine streams. Debris volume was found to be directly related to riparian stand basal area, with species composition of the stand being a strong indicator of stand basal area and stream debris volumes. With the exception of large multi-tier jams, which were not present in the six managed streams, the number and distribution of debris associations were found not to be affected by harvesting. Channel morphology measurements were taken along the same 300 meter reaches and included average active channel width and depth, bank slopes, gradient, spherical canopy density, and angular canopy density. Individual channel parameters measured included pool surface area and depth, riffle surface area and depth, depth and length of bank <b>undercutting,</b> and surface <b>area</b> and depth of multiple channel sections. All measurements were based on active channel flow conditions. No significant differences were found between the harvested and pristine streams with regard to active channel width, depth, or streambank slope. Individual pools were larger in volume in the managed streams. Since the number of pools and their average depth was the same as in the pristine streams, the managed streams had a larger volume of pool habitat. Multiple channel units were seven times more prevalent in harvested reaches than in pristine reaches. There were no differences found in the role of CWD in the formation of stream channel units between the types of stream...|$|R
30|$|Electron {{and neutral}} {{reactions}} are isotropic while ion reactions are highly directional and {{vary with the}} applied bias. By adjusting the bias power, the ions can be accelerated along the desired direction to aid the etching reaction. It is generally accepted that Br does not react spontaneously with Si and that energetic ions are needed for the reaction to occur. Ion-assisted Br and Cl atoms can react with Ge or Si atoms spontaneously under activation to form the volatile products GeBr 4, GeCl 4, SiBr 4, and SiCl 4, which are desorbed from the substrate surface and can be pumped away. This ion-assisted chemical reaction of Si with Br {{has been shown to}} be highly anisotropic. Higher vertical etch rates were obtained using HBr for bias power variations, which confirms that addition of HBr in Cl 2 can enhance the etch rate [17]. Since Cl- and Br-based plasma etch Ge and Si by an ion-assisted mechanism, the energy of ions such as Br+, Br 2 +, HBr+, Cl+, and Cl 2 + can be controlled by biasing the substrate holder. There is no pronounced change of lateral etch rate by varying the bias power for both etching at top surface and necking <b>area.</b> <b>Undercuts</b> were found in the fin structures etched using HBr mixtures, in the necking area, since lateral etching was enhanced by the defects along the Ge/Si interface. And also the mask potentially influences the shape evolution due to the sidewall striking from ion flux. This phenomenon is amplified as the profile becomes deeper and as the lateral ion velocity component increases. Because of the high angular dependence of the HBr-plasma etching process [18], thus, it can be concluded that the crystal structure is relatively weaker at the Ge/Si interface because of the partially bound atoms from the misfit dislocations and the relatively weak Ge-Ge and Ge-Si bonds. By adjusting the ratio of HBr/Cl 2 and bias power, different types of fin-like structures can be obtained during Ge device fabrication. The etching properties of Ge and Si are very similar. Gases that etch Si usually etch Ge at a greater rate. The strengths of Ge and Si bonds have been shown to be Ge-Ge[*]=[*] 263.6 [*]±[*] 7.1  kJ mol− 1 and Si-Si[*]=[*] 325 [*]±[*] 7  kJ mol− 1 [2]. Different bias powers were applied to adjust the vertical etch rate by directional acceleration of the ions. Images were recorded after the gate stack process. The vertical etch rate was calculated from the film height relative to the oxide substrate. Lateral etch rates were determined from two parts of the fin: the lateral etching at the top surface of the fin, and the etching in the necking area close to the Ge/Si interface. In summary, the bias power was experimentally found to be the most critical parameter in the etching process and therefore, in affecting the device characteristics accordingly.|$|R
