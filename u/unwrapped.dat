Moving to London, in 1894 she began studying Egyptology at UCL, developing a friendship with department head Flinders Petrie, who encouraged her early academic publications and appointed her Junior Professor in 1898. In 1902–03 she took part in Petrie's excavations at Abydos, Egypt, there discovering the Osireion temple and the following season investigated the Saqqara cemetery, both of which established her reputation in Egyptology.

40|$|An {{important}} step in the interferometric processing chain is the phase <b>unwrapping,</b> which transforms the ambiguous phase (wrapped in the interval -/+ 180 °) in an unambiguous phase. This unambiguous phase can then {{be used for the}} computation of the scene height model. Standard phase <b>unwrapping</b> methods work with data from a single frequency and a single baseline at a time. The <b>unwrapping</b> becomes extremely challenging for data with small height of ambiguity (HoA), which is usually the case when working with high frequencies and large baselines. The use of multichannel information can help to solve the ambiguities, improving the <b>unwrapping</b> results. However, for airborne repeat-pass InSAR data, the presence of uncompensated residual motion errors usually affects the efficiency of multibaseline approaches. For systems capable of acquiring data simultaneously in different frequency bands, as is the case of the F-SAR of DLR, multifrequency approaches can be explored to cope with the residual errors issue. In this thesis, different <b>unwrapping</b> algorithms are evaluated for the <b>unwrapping</b> of data with small height of ambiguity. Furthermore, methods to jointly <b>unwrap</b> interferograms from multifrequency acquisitions in a robust manner are analyzed...|$|R
25|$|Cats were mummified as {{religious}} offerings in enormous quantities and {{were believed to}} represent the war goddess Bastet. This cult was primarily centered at Thebes and Beni Hasan beginning in the Ptolemaic Period. At Beni Hasan, {{there were so many}} cat mummies {{that at the end of}} the 19th century, a total of 19 tons of mummified Egyptian cats were shipped to England to be used as fertilizer. In addition, thousands of cat mummies have been found at the catacombs of Saqqara. Cats who were bred to become offerings of this type usually died due to strangulation or the breaking of their necks. During mummification, the cat bodies would be dried and filled with soil, sand or some other kind of packing material. They were either positioned with their limbs folded closely to their bodies or in a sitting, lifelike position. The wrapping was usually completed through intricate, geometric patterns. Early in the development of animal mummification, cat mummies were placed in little bronze or wooden sarcophagi. More expensive mummies were typically adorned with features drawn in black paint and colored glass, obsidian or rock crystal eyes. Kittens and fetuses were mummified and buried inside the stomach of a statue that represented their mother. As time went by, like all mummies designed for this purpose, the mummification became less precise. In fact, Sir T. C. S.
