25|$|In 2010, {{a project}} was begun to {{renovate}} the kitchens, servery, dining hall and some other areas of college. The project included the installation of <b>under</b> <b>floor</b> heating and a new timber floor in the dining hall, new kitchen equipment, a new servery area, additional dining and meeting places, and disabled access to the dining hall. During the project, the Old Quad housed a temporary dining hall and kitchen, while the New Quad was used to store building materials.|$|E
25|$|Designed by architects Feilden Clegg Bradley, the BRE offices aim {{to reduce}} energy {{consumption}} and CO2 emissions by 30% from current best practice guidelines and sustain comfortable environmental conditions {{without the use}} of air conditioning. The passive ventilation stacks, solar shading, and hollow concrete slabs with embedded <b>under</b> <b>floor</b> cooling are key features of this building. Ventilation and heating systems are controlled by the building management system (BMS) while a degree of user override is provided to adjust conditions to occupants' needs.|$|E
25|$|Dating {{aspects of}} the fort and vicus of Binchester is quite {{difficult}} given the limited modern archaeological exploration that has occurred on the site. Most of the floors investigated inside the fort have been of opus signinum, and kept relatively clean during their life. A few coins have been found <b>under</b> <b>floor</b> deposits, but these often only give a terminus post quem, and coins stop becoming reliable diagnostic items in the 5th century, although settlement in and around Binchester surely lasted into the early Medieval period. Modern investigation of the vicus has been non-existent or fruitless {{in the search for}} datable finds. It is hoped that the current excavations might inform more about the chronology of the site.|$|E
50|$|Defense Raya Golf Resort, {{also under}} construction, will be Pakistan's largest and Asia's largest golf course. The {{project is the}} result of a {{partnership}} between DHA Lahore and BRDB Malaysia. The rapid development of large projects such as these in the city is expected to boost the economy of the country.Among the many other projects under construction in Lahore are: Pace Tower (24 <b>floors,</b> <b>under</b> construction), Mall99 (21 <b>floors,</b> <b>under</b> construction), Lahore Expo Center (under construction), Expo Center tower (approved), IT Tower (23 <b>floors,</b> <b>under</b> construction), Alamgir Tower (31 <b>floors,</b> <b>under</b> construction), DHA Haly Tower (low rise, under construction), Lahore Ring Road (under construction), Lahore Sports City (approved), Kot Lakhpat elevated expressway (approved), Lahore Rapid Mass Transit System (vision), Xinhua Mall (20 <b>floors,</b> <b>under</b> construction), Lahore-Sialkot motorway (under construction), Boulevard Heights (19 <b>floors,</b> <b>under</b> construction), Pearl Continental Tower (40 floors, 152 meters, proposed), LDA Tower (40 floors, approved), Bank Square Gulberg (vision), Pace Circle and Hyatt Regency (12 <b>floors,</b> <b>under</b> construction) and Tricon Corporate Tower (18 <b>floors,</b> <b>under</b> construction).|$|R

60|$|The B. and A. s.s. Senegal {{is a fair}} {{specimen}} of the modern West African trader 'improved:' unfortunately the improvements affect the shareholders' pockets rather than the passengers' persons. The sleeping-berths are better, but the roomy, well-lighted, comfortable old saloon, sadly shorn of its fair proportions, has become the upper story of a store-room. The unfortunate stewards must catch fever by frequent diving into the close and sultry mine of solids and fluids <b>under</b> <b>floor.</b> There being no baggage-compartment, boxes and bags are stowed away in the after part, unduly curtailing light and air; the stern lockers, once such pleasant sleeping-sofas, and their fixed tables are of no use to anything besides baskets and barrels. Here the surgeon, who, if anyone, should have a cabin by way of dispensary, must lodge his medicine-chest. Amongst minor grievances the main cabin is washed every night, breeding a manner of malaria. The ice intended for passengers is either sold or preserved for those who ship most cargo. Per contra, the cook is good, the table is plentiful, the wines not over bad, the stewards civil, and the officers companionable.|$|E

50|$|<b>Under</b> <b>floor</b> radiant {{systems are}} {{evaluated}} for sustainability through {{the principles of}} efficiency, entropy, exergy and efficacy. When combined with high performance buildings, <b>under</b> <b>floor</b> systems operate with low temperatures in heating and high temperatures in cooling in the ranges found typically in geothermal and solar thermal systems. When coupled with these non combustible, renewable energy sources the sustainability benefits include reduction or elimination of combustion and greenhouse gases produced by boilers and power generation for heat pumps and chillers, as well as reduced demands for non renewables and greater inventories for future generations. This has been supported through simulation evaluations and through research funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, Fraunhofer Institute as well as ASHRAE.|$|E
