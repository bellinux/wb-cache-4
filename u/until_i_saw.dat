500|$|Joyce, a 22-year veteran, tearfully {{admitted}} {{after reviewing}} {{video of the}} play after the game that [...] "I {{did not get the}} call correct", insisting that he [...] "took a perfect game away from that kid over there that worked his ass off all night". Joyce called the Donald ruling [...] "the biggest call of my career", claiming that [...] "I thought [...] beat the throw. I was convinced he beat the throw, <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the replay". The umpire later said, [...] "I didn't want this to be my 15 minutes of fame. I would have liked my 15 minutes to be a great call in the World Series. Hopefully, my 15 minutes are over now".|$|E
500|$|Kathy Baker saw {{her part}} of Joyce, the {{neighbor}} {{who tries to}} seduce Edward, as a perfect chance to break into comedy. Alan Arkin says when he first read the script, he was [...] "a bit baffled. Nothing really {{made sense to me}} <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the sets. Burton's visual imagination is extraordinary". The role of The Inventor was written specifically for Vincent Price, and would ultimately be his final feature film role. Burton commonly watched Price's films as a child, and, after completing Vincent, the two became good friends. Robert Oliveri was cast as Kevin, Kim's younger brother. Nick Carter from The Backstreet Boys plays an uncredited role as the blond boy playing on the Slip 'n Slide as Edward rides in Peg's car through suburbia.|$|E

500|$|Bakshi {{claimed he}} [...] "didn't start {{thinking}} about shooting the film totally in live action <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it really start to work so well. I learned lots of things about the process, like rippling. One scene, some figures were standing on a hill and a big gust of wind came up and the shadows moved {{back and forth on}} the clothes and it was unbelievable in animation. I don't think I could get the feeling of cold on the screen without showing snow or an icicle on some guy's nose. The characters have weight and they move correctly." [...] After the Spanish film development lab discovered that telephone lines, helicopters, and cars could be seen in the footage Bakshi had shot, they tried to incinerate the footage, telling Bakshi's first assistant director that [...] "if that kind of sloppy cinematography got out, no one from Hollywood would ever come back to Spain to shoot again." ...|$|E
500|$|Both Hollywood trade {{publications}} were positive: David Hunter of The Hollywood Reporter predicted {{it to be}} a sleeper hit {{and called}} it [...] "outstanding," [...] while Lael Loewenstein of Variety called it [...] "a visually appealing, well-crafted film [...] an unalloyed success." [...] Bruce Fretts of Entertainment Weekly commented, [...] "I have long thought that I was born without the gene that would allow me to be emotionally drawn in by drawings. That is, <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> The Iron Giant." [...] Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle agreed that the storytelling was far superior to other animated films, and cited the characters as plausible and noted the richness of moral themes. Jeff Millar of the Houston Chronicle agreed with the basic techniques as well, and concluded the voice cast excelled with a great script by Tim McCanlies. Amid the positive reviews, a mildly negative review came from The Washington Post Stephen Hunter, who opined, [...] "The movie — as beautifully drawn, as sleek and engaging as it is — has the annoyance of incredible smugness." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{species was}} first {{collected}} by the botanist William Russell Dudley in October 1888, in Tompkins County, New York. American mycologist Charles Horton Peck, who described it in the 1894 Annual Report of the New York State Botanist, named it Peziza Dudleyi after its discoverer. Peck noted a physical resemblance to P.aurantia (now known as Aleuria aurantia) and P.inaequalis, and said {{that it could be}} distinguished from those species by its yellow hymenium and larger spores. Several mycologists have considered the species to be synonymous with S.coccinea. However, as was later pointed out by Harrington (1990), [...] "the importance of fresh material for species diagnosis, especially for noting ascospore guttulation, cannot be overstated. Although I had examined material (dried herbarium specimens) from western North America I was not prepared to recognize that group as a species distinct from the two, large eastern North American species <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> fresh (living) material." [...] As is the case with many fungi, microscopic differences between similar species can only be accurately determined by examining fresh material. Harrington analyzed herbarium specimens and fresh material of North American specimens of [...] "S.coccinea", and found that both S.dudleyi and S.austriaca were commonly misidentified. These results echoed a similar 1984 analysis of European specimens, performed by Hans-Otto Baral.|$|E

500|$|Cher's {{music plays}} {{a large role}} in [...] "The Post-Modern Prometheus", Chris Carter having written the episode after {{spending}} a summer listening to Cher records and developing a fixation on the singer. Carter knew that Cher's half-sister Georganne LaPiere was a major X-Files fan, and Carter learned through LaPiere that Cher herself was intrigued by the show and would be interested in making an X-Files guest appearance. Sitcom star Roseanne Barr also expressed an interest in guesting on The X-Files, and Carter wrote the part of Shaineh Berkowitz specifically for her. Barr, however, was unavailable at the time of shooting—her projected role was filled by Pattie Tierce— while Cher passed on the proffered cameo appearance performing as herself, a decision for which she later expressed regret: [...] "I wanted them to ask me to come on and act—then they just wanted me to come on and sing ... Just to come on and be myself wasn't anything I'd want to do <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> [...] " [...] — [...] "Had I [...] the quality of [...] I would have done it in a heartbeat." [...] Cher did authorize the use of three of her tracks on the episode's soundtrack including [...] "Walking in Memphis" [...] heard at the episode's conclusion while ostensibly performed onstage by celebrity impersonator Tracey Bell—filmed in longshot or from the back or overheard—as Cher. Although Bell was credited for the role, Cher's fans responded to the episode's premiere with online speculation as to whether the singer had pseudonymously appeared in the episode. [...] Tabloid talk show host Jerry Springer appeared as himself. These casting choices went against a long-standing tradition on The X-Files of only casting actors who were not well-known.|$|E

2500|$|Whereas Junkie and Queer were {{conventional}} in style, Naked Lunch was {{his first}} venture into a nonlinear style. After the publication of Naked Lunch, a book whose creation was {{to a certain extent}} the result of a series of contingencies, Burroughs was exposed to Brion Gysin's cut-up technique at the Beat Hotel in Paris in October 1959. He began slicing up phrases and words to create new sentences. At the Beat Hotel Burroughs discovered [...] "a port of entry" [...] into Gysin's canvases: [...] "I don't think I had ever seen painting <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the painting of Brion Gysin." [...] The two would cultivate a long-term friendship that revolved around a mutual interest in artworks and cut-up techniques. Scenes were slid together with little care for narrative. Perhaps thinking of his crazed physician, Dr. Benway, he described Naked Lunch as a book that could be cut into at any point. Although not considered science fiction, the book does seem to forecast AIDS, liposuction, and the crack pandemic.|$|E
2500|$|Blethyn's {{breakthrough}} {{came with}} Mike Leigh's 1996 drama Secrets & Lies. Starring alongside Marianne Jean-Baptiste, she portrayed a lower-class box factory worker, who after years once again {{comes in contact}} with her illegitimate grown-up black daughter, whom she gave up for adoption thirty years earlier. For her improvised performance, Blethyn was praised {{with a variety of}} awards, including the Best Actress Award at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, the British Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe and an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. Upon its success, Blethyn later stated: [...] "I knew it was a great film, but I didn't expect it to get the attention it did because none of his other films had and I thought they were just as good. Of course, I didn't know what it was about <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it in the cinema because of the way that he works— but I knew it was good. That it reached a wider audience surprised me." [...] Besides critical acclaim Secrets & Lies also became a financial success; budgeted at an estimated $4.5 million, the film grossed an unexpected $13.5 million in its limited theatrical run in North America.|$|E
2500|$|Blanchett {{returned}} to the theatre in 2009 with the Sydney Theatre Company production of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire, directed by Liv Ullmann. She starred as Blanche DuBois alongside Joel Edgerton as Stanley Kowalski. Ullmann and Blanchett had been meaning to collaborate on a project since Ullman's intended film adaption of A Doll's House fell by the wayside. Blanchett proposed embarking on Streetcar to Ullmann, who jumped at the opportunity after initial discussion. The production traveled from Sydney to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York, and the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. It was critically and commercially successful and Blanchett received critical acclaim for her performance as Blanche DuBois. The New York Times critic Ben Brantley said, [...] "DuBois has been pulled gently and firmly down to earth by Ms. Blanchett and Ms. Ullmann ... What Ms. Blanchett brings to the character is life itself, a primal survival instinct ... All the baggage that any [...] "Streetcar" [...] usually travels with has been jettisoned. Ms. Ullmann and Ms. Blanchett have performed the play {{as if it had}} never been staged before, with the result that, as a friend of mine put it, [...] "you feel like you’re hearing words you thought you knew pronounced correctly for the first time."" [...] The Washington Posts Peter Marks proclaimed, [...] "What Blanchett achieves in the Sydney Theatre Company's revelatory revival of [...] "A Streetcar Named Desire" [...] amounts to a truly great portrayal—certainly the most heartbreaking Blanche I've ever experienced." [...] John Lahr of The New Yorker said of her portrayal, [...] "Blanchett, with her alert mind, her informed heart, and her lithe, patrician silhouette, gets it right from the first beat ... Blanchett doesn’t make the usual mistake of foreshadowing Blanche’s end at the play’s beginning; she allows Blanche a slow, fascinating decline ... I don’t expect to see a better performance of this role in my lifetime." [...] Jane Fonda, who attended a New York show, deemed it [...] "perhaps the greatest stage performance I have ever seen", and Meryl Streep declared, [...] "That performance was as naked, as raw and extraordinary and astonishing and surprising and scary as anything I've ever seen ... She took the layers of a person and just peeled them away. I thought I'd seen that play, I thought I knew all the lines by heart, because I've seen it so many times, but I'd never seen the play <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that performance." [...] Blanchett won the Sydney Theatre Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. The production and Blanchett received Helen Hayes Awards, for Outstanding Non-Resident Production and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Non-Resident Production award, respectively.|$|E
