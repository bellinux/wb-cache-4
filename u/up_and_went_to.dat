25|$|In {{the next}} race, the Austrian Grand Prix, Montoya finally outpaced his {{teammate}} Ralf Schumacher in qualifying {{and took a}} career-best second. It looked better and better for him {{as he took the}} lead at the start and pulled away, with second-placed Ralf holding up a string of five cars behind him. But, after 10 laps, Schumacher retired with brake failure. Montoya was struggling with the same problems, and Schumacher had been told to hold the others up so that Montoya could build a gap. With Ralf Schumacher out, the five drivers, led by Michael Schumacher began to close on Montoya at over a second a lap. Soon Schumacher was right on Montoya's tail and tried to pass him around the outside at Remus Curve. Montoya kept on the inside, braked late, locked <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the gravel. Schumacher was also forced to go to the gravel to avoid Montoya. Montoya rejoined seventh, just behind Schumacher. Montoya went for an early stop which solved his problems. He was set for one point in sixth until he stopped on the track with a hydraulic failure. After the race, Schumacher said that 'all Montoya was doing was to try to take Schumacher out with himself off the circuit'.|$|E

2500|$|Farming {{activities}} were very labour-intensive before {{the industrial revolution}} {{and the advent of}} tractors, combines, balers, etc. From the late 19th century to the mid-20th century, a great percentage of the Canadian labour force was engaged in high labour, smaller farming practices. After mechanization, scientific advancement, improved marketing practices farms became more efficient, larger and less labour-intensive. The labour population was freed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> industry, government, transportation, trade and finance. [...] Agriculture, stock raising and horticulture employed one-fourth of the Canadian population according to the 1951 census as well as providing products for exports and Canadian manufacturing concerns.|$|E
2500|$|Herbert Marshall McLuhan {{was born}} on July 21, 1911, in Edmonton, Alberta, the son of Elsie Naomi (née Hall) and Herbert Ernest McLuhan, both born in Canada. His brother Maurice was born two years later. [...] "Marshall" [...] was his {{maternal}} grandmother's surname. His mother was a Baptist school teacher who later became an actress; {{his father was a}} Methodist and had a real estate business in Edmonton. That business failed when World War I broke out, and McLuhan's father enlisted in the Canadian army. After a year of service, he contracted influenza and remained in Canada, away from the front lines. After his discharge from the army in 1915, the McLuhan family moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba, where Marshall grew <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> school, attending Kelvin Technical School before enrolling in the University of Manitoba in 1928.|$|E
2500|$|Nilus of Sinai (d. c.430), in his Letter to Heliodorus Silentiarius, records {{a miracle}} in which St. Plato of Ankyra {{appeared}} to a Christian in a dream. The Saint was recognized because {{the young man}} had often seen his portrait. [...] This recognition of a religious apparition from likeness to an image was also a characteristic of pagan pious accounts of appearances of gods to humans, and was a regular topos in hagiography. [...] One critical recipient of a vision from Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki apparently specified that the saint resembled the [...] "more ancient" [...] images of him – presumably the 7th century mosaics still in Hagios Demetrios. [...] Another, an African bishop, had been rescued from Arab slavery by a young soldier called Demetrios, who told him to go to his house in Thessaloniki. [...] Having discovered that most young soldiers in the city seemed to be called Demetrios, he gave <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the largest church in the city, to find his rescuer on the wall.|$|E

2500|$|Tyler has {{occasionally}} been {{classified as}} a “Southern author” or a “modern American author.” [...] The Southern category apparently results {{from the fact that}} she grew <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> college in the South. [...] Also she admired and/or studied under well-known Southern authors Eudora Welty and Reynolds Price. In a rare interview with The New York Times, Tyler cited Eudora Welty as a major literary influence: [...] "Reading Eudora Welty when I was growing up showed me that very small things are often really larger than the large things". [...] However, poet and author Katha Pollitt notes, “It is hard to classify Anne Tyler’s novels. [...] They are Southern in their sure sense of family and place but lack the taste for violence and the Gothic that often characterizes self-consciously southern literature. [...] They are modern in their fictional techniques, yet utterly unconcerned with contemporary moment as a subject, so that, with only minor dislocations, her stories could just as well have taken place in twenties or thirties.” ...|$|E
