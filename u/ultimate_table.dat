40|$|We {{present a}} tool that {{extracts}} phrase pairs from a word-aligned parallel corpus and filters them on the fly based on a user-defined frequency threshold. The bulk of phrase pairs to be scored is much reduced, making the whole phrase table construction process faster with no significant harm to the <b>ultimate</b> phrase <b>table</b> quality as measured by BLEU. Technically, our tool is {{an alternative to the}} extract component of the phrase-extract toolkit bundled with Moses SMT software and covers some of the functionality of sigfilter. 1...|$|R

50|$|Sealand is not {{recognised}} by {{any major}} international sporting body, and its population {{is insufficient to}} maintain a team composed entirely of Sealanders in any team sport. However, Sealand claims to have official national athletes, including non-Sealanders. These athletes take part in various sports, such as curling, mini-golf, football, fencing, <b>ultimate</b> frisbee, <b>table</b> football and athletics, although all its teams compete out of the country. The Sealand National Football Association is an associate member of the Nouvelle Fédération-Board, a football sanctioning body for non-recognised states and states not members of FIFA. It administers the Sealand national football team. In 2004 the national team played its first international game against Åland Islands national football team, drawing 2-2.Sealand claims that its first official athlete was Darren Blackburn of Oakville, Ontario, Canada, who was appointed in 2003. Blackburn has represented Sealand {{at a number of}} local sporting events, including marathons and off-trail races. In 2004, mountaineer Slader Oviatt carried the Sealandic flag to the top of Muztagh Ata. Also in 2007, Michael Martelle represented the Principality of Sealand in the World Cup of Kung Fu, held in Quebec City, Canada; bearing the designation of Athleta Principalitas Bellatorius (Principal Martial Arts Athlete and Champion), Martelle won two silver medals, becoming the first-ever Sealand athlete to appear on a world championship podium.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{logistic}} and non-logistic cumulative (sigmoidal) models that have fairly equal degree of predictions are compared for their peak point occurrences. It is discovered that only logistic (Hubbert) models have their peaks at half {{way to the}} ultimate recovery. Non-logistic models peak not necessarily at half way (but at some other point) to the <b>ultimate</b> recovery (see <b>table</b> 1). Peaking of logistic and non-logistic models are functions of the models, and not geology. Empirical experience revealed that even with different logistic models the same historical data gives different peaks and ultimate values; revealing that these values are mainly functions of the models, and not geology. When the historical data is large enough all the logistic models tend to peak at half way to the ultimate (central limit theorem). Peak production could therefore occur somewhere other than at half way to the ultimate recovery depending on the mathematical model used and is basically {{a function of the}} model if the historical data is not large...|$|R
40|$|To {{elucidate}} promoting and inhibiting {{effects of}} hydrogen cynamide (HC) and abscisic acid (ABA) on quiescence release of grape buds, physiological and molecular approaches {{were used to}} explore the mechanisms of quiescence based on metabolic and gene expression analysis. Physiological and molecular mechanisms involved in bud quiescence of grape were studied before and after application of HC, ABA, and ABA-HC. The data showed that ABA inhibited proclamation of quiescence in grape buds and attenuated the influence of HC. Bud quiescence was promoted and regulated by HC and ABA pre-treatment on buds of grape cultivar “Shine Muscat” with 5 % HC, 100 μM ABA and combination of ABA-HC (5 % HC+ 100 μM ABA) during quiescence under forcing condition. Exogenous application of ABA elevated superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) related specific activities, while catalase (CAT) activity was increased during initial period of forcing and then decreased. The concentration of plant growth hormones including gibberellins (GA) and indole acetic acid increased by HC application but decreased the ABA contents under forcing condition. ABA increased the fructose content during quiescence under forcing condition while sucrose and total soluble sugars peaked in HC treated buds as compared to control. Genes related to ABA pathway, protein phosphatase 2 C (PP 2 C family) were down regulated in the buds treated with HC, ABA and ABA-HC as compared to control while two genes related to GA pathway (GID 1 family), out of which one gene showed down regulation during initial period of forcing while other gene was up regulated in response to HC and ABA-HC treatments as compared to control. Exogenous ABA application up regulated genes related to antioxidant enzymes as compared to control. The gene probable fructose-bisphosphate aldolase 1, chloroplastic-like, was up regulated in response to ABA treatment as compared to control. Analysis of metabolites and related gene expression pattern would provide a comprehensive view of quiescence after HC, ABA, and ABA-HC treatments in grape buds which may helpful for <b>ultimate</b> improvement in <b>table</b> grape production...|$|R
