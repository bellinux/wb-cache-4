2500|$|The Byzantine navy, {{the largest}} Mediterranean war fleet {{throughout}} most of the early Middle Ages, employed crescent formations with the flagship in the center and the heavier ships at the horns of the formation, in order to turn the enemy's flanks. Similar tactics are believed to have been employed by the Arab fleets they frequently fought from the 7th century onwards. The Byzantines were the first to employ Greek fire, a highly effective incendiary liquid, as a naval weapon. It could be fired through a metal tube, or siphon mounted in the bows, similar to a modern flame thrower. The properties of Greek fire were close to that of napalm and was a key to several major Byzantine victories. By 835, the weapon had spread to the Arabs, who equipped harraqas, [...] "fireships", with it. The initial stages in naval battles was an exchanges of missiles, ranging from combustible projectiles to arrows, caltrops and javelins. The aim was not to sink ships, but to deplete the ranks of the enemy crews before the boarding commenced, which decided the outcome. Once the enemy strength was judged to have been reduced sufficiently, the fleets closed in, the ships grappled each other, and the marines and <b>upper</b> <b>bank</b> oarsmen boarded the enemy vessel and engaged in hand-to-hand combat. Byzantine dromons had pavesades, racks along the railings, on which marines could hang their shields, providing protection to the deck crew. Larger ships also had wooden castles on either side between the masts, which allowed archers to shoot from an elevated firing position.|$|E

Here the rebels had also a Maxim and other guns, and it seemed as if for once the advance of the Americans was thoroughly blocked. Numerous good positions along the south bank of the river were held by our troops, but it looked as if they could not get over the stream without a tremendous loss of life.|$|E

In 1987 the city of Santa Cruz retained ROMA, a San Francisco design firm, to develop a design concept plan for incorporating the natural elements of the river into the urban design fabric of the city. The plan led to creation of pedestrian walkways, picnic areas and view opportunities along the lower populated stretch of the river.

40|$|Tidal {{environments in}} the western part of Mont Saint-Michel Bay, reputed for its tidal range, {{comprise}} numerous shore-parallel bars and banks consisting of coarse biogenic sands rich in well-preserved shells. The shell banks can be grouped into three morphological types according to their size and their position within the tidal environments: salt marsh <b>banks,</b> <b>upper</b> tidal flat <b>banks</b> and mid- to <b>upper</b> tidal flat <b>banks.</b> The mid- to <b>upper</b> tidal flat <b>banks</b> migrate shoreward, at rates of several tens of m/year, from the lower tidal flat towards the Duchess Anne dyke, which forms the present shoreline, and which was built in the 11 th century to protect a coastal marsh, the Dol marsh, from marine influence. The salt marsh banks are relatively stable, their migration rates not exceeding a few cm/year. The morphodynamic study of these sedimentary bodies highlights various stages of evolution from the western to the eastern part of the bay, depending on exposure to wave action which drives bank migration. The oldest, almost fossil salt marsh banks, are situated {{in the western}} part of the bay, while recent dynamic tidal flat banks develop in the more exposed eastern part. The <b>upper</b> tidal flat <b>banks</b> are gradually forming an almost continuous barrier located a few hundred metres in front of an old shell barrier on which the Duchess Anne dyke was built...|$|R
