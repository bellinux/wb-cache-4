50|$|The {{quality of}} citizen is granted to men 21 {{years old and}} older, {{following}} an <b>uninterrupted</b> <b>residence</b> of one year on French soil, counting from the day of their inscription on the civic table of a primary assembly. All public offices are open to citizens aged 25 years old and older.|$|E
5000|$|Each year of {{marriage}} to a Danish citizen reduces the requirement by one year, to a maximum reduction of 3 years. For example, as little as 6 years of continuous <b>uninterrupted</b> <b>residence</b> {{for people who have}} been married to Danish nationals for 3 years. One year of cohabitation before marriage counts as a year {{of marriage}} for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|Any EU/EEA {{national}} who completes {{a five-year}} period of <b>uninterrupted</b> legal <b>residence</b> in another EU/EEA state becomes eligible for permanent residence, after which their presence is no longer subjected to any conditions, and they may apply for benefits that would previously have been grounds for removal, such as welfare. Permanent residency can only be revoked after a two-year absence.|$|R
50|$|For {{being able}} to be elected as governor, the citizen must have been born in Argentina, or be the child of an Argentine citizen if born at a foreign country. The citizen must also be of at least 30 years old, and have at least 5 <b>uninterrupted</b> years of <b>residence</b> in the {{province}} if not natural from it. The period lasts 4 years, with the chance of a single reelection.|$|R
50|$|In 1949 the Ceylon Parliament {{passed a}} {{different}} subsequent act called Indian and Pakistani Residents (Citizenship) Act No.3 of 1949 whose outward purpose, again, {{was to provide}} means of obtaining citizenship for the Indian Tamils. But in reality the conditions imposed by the Act were such that they discriminated against the Indian Tamils. The Act granted citizenship to anyone who had 10 years of <b>uninterrupted</b> <b>residence</b> in Ceylon (7 years for married persons) and whose income was above the stipulated level. Again, this was an impossible task for most Indian Tamils. They {{had a habit of}} periodically returning to India, thereby interrupting their residence in Ceylon, and most could not meet the income qualification. Only about 100,000 Indian Tamils qualified for citizenship under this Act.|$|E
5000|$|From 1868 to 1937, the United States {{entered into}} 25 Bancroft {{treaties}} covering 34 foreign countries. A typical Bancroft treaty had three major provisions. The first specified the terms under which each party would recognize the naturalization {{of its citizens}} by the other. (Five years' <b>uninterrupted</b> <b>residence</b> in the adopted country was the usual requirement.) The second provided that naturalized citizens who returned to their native country could be prosecuted for crimes that they allegedly committed before they emigrated. The third and most important provided that naturalized citizens who returned to {{their country of origin}} and stayed there for two continuous years would be presumed to have resumed their former nationality. That would require them to meet any unfulfilled military service obligation in their native country and deny them the diplomatic protection of their adopted one. Article III of the 1908 treaty with Portugal was typical: ...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of Leishmania infantum-specific antibodies and asymptomatic infection was assessed in a randomized sample of 526 healthy adults from a continental area of Northwestern Italy where L. infantum is not endemic and where autochthonous cases of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) were recently reported. L. infantum-specific antibodies were detected by Western blotting (WB) in 39 subjects (7. 41 %), while L. infantum kinetoplast DNA was amplified from buffy coat in 21 out of 39 WB-positive subjects, confirming asymptomatic infection in 53. 8 % of seropositives. Risk factors {{significantly associated with}} WB positivity were <b>uninterrupted</b> <b>residence</b> since childhood in a local rural environment (odds ratio [OR], 3. 5; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 7 to 7. 3), daily contact with animals though not exclusively with dogs (OR, 3. 7; 95 % CI, 1. 3 to 10. 7), older age (OR, 2. 31; 95 % CI, 1. 2 to 4. 5), and agricultural/other outdoor activities (OR, 3. 8; 95 % CI, 0. 99 to 3. 7.) Logistic regression analysis showed that <b>uninterrupted</b> <b>residence</b> in a local rural environment and an age of > 65 years were the only independent predictors of seropositivity assessed by WB. Follow-up at 24 months did not show evidence of VL in either seropositive or PCR-positive subjects. The detection of a high seroprevalence rate, confirmed as asymptomatic infection by PCR {{in more than half}} of the cases, among healthy residents in a continental area of northwestern Italy makes local L. infantum transmission very likely. In a region where VL is considered nonendemic, these findings warrant further epidemiological investigations as well as interventions with respect to both the canine reservoir and vectors, given the possible risks for immunosuppressed patients...|$|E
