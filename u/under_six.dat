All horses entered must be registered with the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders' and Exhibitors' Association, although some may be registered with the Spotted Saddle Horse and Racking Horse associations as well.

5|$|Due to {{the rapid}} motion of Nanmadol, the typhoon crossed Luzon in <b>under</b> <b>six</b> hours, {{emerging}} into the South China Sea before 1800UTC on December2. Though land interaction with the Philippines did not significantly affect the cyclone, a shortwave trough forced Nanmadol to sharply curve northward, bringing it into hostile atmospheric conditions within the Luzon Strait. At 0000UTC on December3, the JMA downgraded Nanmadol to severe tropical storm status. Increased wind shear and the advection of dry air further weakened the tropical cyclone, and by midday on December3, the storm's center of circulation became decoupled {{from the rest of}} the convection. At 2340UTC that day, Nanmadol made landfall near Fangliao, Pingtung in Taiwan, becoming the first December tropical cyclone to strike the island in 108years of record-keeping. Roughly six hours later on December4, the JMA determined that Nanmadol had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. These remnants soon merged with another low-pressure area, creating a more powerful system that later tracked over Japan.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{most cases}} of {{fluoride}} poisoning {{have been caused}} by accidental ingestion of insecticides containing inorganic fluorides. Most current calls to poison control centers for possible fluoride poisoning come from the ingestion of fluoride-containing toothpaste. Malfunctioning water fluoridation equipment is another cause: one incident in Alaska affected almost 300 people and killed one person. Dangers from toothpaste are aggravated for small children, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends supervising children below six brushing their teeth so that they do not swallow toothpaste. One regional study examined a year of pre-teen fluoride poisoning reports totaling 87 cases, including one death from ingesting insecticide. Most had no symptoms, but about 30% had stomach pains. A larger study across the U.S. had similar findings: 80% of cases involved children <b>under</b> <b>six,</b> and there were few serious cases.|$|E
5|$|In 1678 the Manche Ch'ol {{population}} was devastated by disease; {{in the area}} around the town of San Lucas Tzalac it killed every child <b>under</b> <b>six</b> years old and almost all of those under the age of ten. Total deaths, including adults, numbered over 400 and the epidemic prompted all the Manche Ch'ol in the affected region to abandon the mission towns and flee into the forest. The Spanish made a number of further attempts to pacify the Manche Ch'ol, but these were ultimately unsuccessful, and the Manche Ch'ol rebelled in 1689. In that year many Manche Ch'ol were forcibly relocated to the Urrán Valley in the highlands, resulting in the abandonment of many of the Manche orchards; this eventually led to the collapse of the regional trade network that by then had been fully linked with colonial Guatemala and supplied it with unknown quantities of cacao.|$|E

South Africa's first victory in Twenty20 International cricket came against Ireland in August 2008. Mignon du Preez is South Africa's all-time leading run-scorer with 1166 runs. Shandre Fritz is the only South African women to have scored a century in a Twenty20 International, scoring the second highest total in any women's Twenty20 International with a score of 116 not out against the Netherlands.

5|$|Under Mandela's presidency, welfare {{spending}} increased by 13% in 1996/97, 13% in 1997/98, and 7% in 1998/99. The government introduced parity in grants for communities, including disability grants, child maintenance grants, and old-age pensions, which {{had previously been}} set at different levels for South Africa's different racial groups. In 1994, free healthcare was introduced for children <b>under</b> <b>six</b> and pregnant women, a provision extended to all those using primary level public sector health care services in 1996. By the 1999 election, the ANC could boast that due to their policies, 3 million people were connected to telephone lines, 1.5 million children were brought into the education system, 500 clinics were upgraded or constructed, 2 million people were connected to the electricity grid, water access was extended to 3 million people, and 750,000 houses were constructed, housing nearly 3 million people.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the school}} {{there was an}} infant school for {{children}} <b>under</b> <b>six,</b> a primary school for children under ten, {{and there was a}} preparatory school that prepared children for college in six years. When entering the school, each pupil under high school age was assigned a woman of the community {{who was in charge of}} his/her wardrobe, personal habits, and exercise. The teachers included three graduates of Harvard Divinity School (George Ripley, George Bradford, John Sullivan Dwight) as well as several women (Ripley's wife Sophia, his sister Marianne, and his cousin Hannah, as well as Georgianna Bruce and Abby Morton). Ripley was in charge of teaching English and was known to be relaxed in his class. Dana taught languages, being able to speak ten himself. Dwight taught music as well as Latin. Students studied European languages and literature and, at no extra cost, pupils could also indulge in the fine arts. The primary school was overseen by Sophia Ripley and Marianne Ripley, using a progressive child-centered pedagogy that has been compared to the later reforms of John Dewey. Sophia Ripley's dedication to the school was remarked upon by many; she only missed two classes in six years.|$|E
5|$|Overdoses of {{ingested}} iron {{can cause}} excessive levels of free iron in the blood. High {{blood levels of}} free ferrous iron react with peroxides to produce highly reactive free radicals that can damage DNA, proteins, lipids, and other cellular components. Iron toxicity occurs when the cell contains free iron, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the availability of transferrin to bind the iron. Damage to {{the cells of the}} gastrointestinal tract can also prevent them from regulating iron absorption, leading to further increases in blood levels. Iron typically damages cells in the heart, liver and elsewhere, causing adverse effects that include coma, metabolic acidosis, shock, liver failure, coagulopathy, adult respiratory distress syndrome, long-term organ damage, and even death. Humans experience iron toxicity when the iron exceeds 20milligrams for every kilogram of body mass; 60milligrams per kilogram is considered a lethal dose. Overconsumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of ferrous sulfate tablets intended for adult consumption, {{is one of the most}} common toxicological causes of death in children <b>under</b> <b>six.</b> The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) sets the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults at 45mg/day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40mg/day.|$|E
