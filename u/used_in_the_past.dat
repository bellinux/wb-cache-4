5|$|Biblical Hebrew has {{two main}} {{conjugation}} types, the suffix conjugation, {{also called the}} Perfect, and the prefix conjugation, also called Imperfect. The Perfect verb form expressed {{the idea of the}} verb as a completed action, viewing it from start to finish as a whole, and not focusing on the process by which the verb came to be completed, stating it as a simple fact. This is often <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> tense, however there are some contexts in which a Perfect verb translates into the present and future tenses.|$|E
5|$|Paris–Roubaix {{presents}} a technical challenge to riders, team personnel, and equipment. Special frames and wheels are often <b>used.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> developments {{to cope with}} the demands of Paris–Roubaix have included the use of wider tires, cantilever brakes, and dual brake levers. More recently, manufacturers such as Specialized have developed new types of bike which are designed {{to cope with the}} demands on the cobbled classics: the best known being the Specialized Roubaix series, which has a longer wheelbase and is designed to offer the rider a more forgiving ride. Many teams disperse personnel along the course with spare wheels, equipment and bicycles to help in locations not accessible to the team car.|$|E

5|$|Residual lead in soil {{contributes}} to lead exposure in urban areas. It has been {{thought that the}} more polluted an area is with various contaminants, {{the more likely it}} is to contain lead. However, this is not always the case, as there are several other reasons for lead contamination in soil. Lead content in soil may be caused by broken-down lead paint, residues from lead-containing gasoline, used engine oil, or pesticides <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> contaminated landfills, or from nearby industries such as foundries or smelters. Although leaded soil is less of a problem in countries that no longer have leaded gasoline, it remains prevalent, raising concerns about the safety of urban agriculture; eating food grown in contaminated soil can present a lead hazard.|$|E
5|$|A {{third track}} along {{much of the}} line north of 96th Street has been <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> for peak {{direction}} express service, at least between 96th Street and 137th Street. This center track is currently used only during construction reroutes. There is another unused third track between Dyckman Street and Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street. Three yards have connections to the line. The 240th Street Yard is located between Van Cortlandt Park-242nd Street and 238th Street. This yard holds 21 layup tracks and can hold the entire rolling stock for the 1. The next yard, 207th Street Yard holds a few trains that are used during rush hours and cleans and overhauls some of the line's fleet. Finally, the 137th Street Yard has six tracks, which hold rush hour turn-around trains.|$|E
5|$|Fares are AR$7.50 per {{trip on the}} Subte, {{though these}} can be as low as AR$4.50 per trip {{depending}} on how many trips are made per month, while the Premetro has a flat rate of AR$1.50. While tokens have been <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> at present, riders use contactless cards called SUBE, which are rechargeable with multiple forms of payment. Previously, single or multi-use paper cards with a magnetic strip (called Subtepass) were used, however, these were phased {{out of the system}} in May 2016, opting instead only to use the digital cards, with the exception of some retired, disabled and student cards. Trains run from 05:00 until 23:00, every 3–4minutes, for all lines except Line H which has a frequency of around 6minutes. Under modernisation plans commenced in 2013, service frequencies are set to increase to an average of one train every 2:20 by 2019.|$|E

40|$|Thirty-two {{personal}} characteristics were examined as potential predictors of mammography <b>use</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> year <b>in</b> a geriatric clinic. Interviews assessed demographic, health status, health service utilization, health belief, and {{psychological and social}} variables (n = 242, mean age = 76 years). Four variables were independently associated with mammography <b>use</b> <b>in</b> logistic regression analysis: age, historical mammography use, perceived severity, and perceived barriers. The inverse relationship between age and mammography <b>use</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> year was not modified by health status, functional status, and the other independently predictive variables. The authors conclude that geriatrics specialty care does not eliminate <b>the</b> age-associated decline <b>in</b> mammography <b>use</b> that has been previously described. The factors associated with mammography <b>use</b> <b>in</b> this sample {{were similar to those}} that have been described in younger populations of women. Variables examined because of specific gerontologic considerations were not independently associated with mammography <b>use</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> year...|$|R

5|$|Later on {{the evening}} of 7 August, she asked Bamber whether he had done it. He said no, but that a friend of his had, whom he named; the man was a plumber the family had <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> Bamber {{allegedly}} said he had told this friend how he could enter and leave the farmhouse undetected, and that one of his instructions had been for the friend to telephone him from the farm on one of the phones in the house that had a memory redial facility, so that if the police checked it, it would give him an alibi. Everything had gone as planned, he said, except that Nevill had put up a fight, and the friend had become angry and shot him seven times. The friend had allegedly told Sheila to lie down and shoot herself last, Bamber said. The friend then placed the Bible on her chest so she appeared to have killed herself in a religious frenzy. The children were shot in their sleep, he said. Mugford said Bamber claimed to have paid the friend £2,000.|$|E
5|$|Schreck was a {{founding}} member of the Sturmabteilung ("Storm Department"; SA), being involved in its growth and development. This was a paramilitary wing of the party designed to disrupt political opponents and provide muscle for security tasks. Hitler, in early 1923, ordered the formation of a small separate bodyguard dedicated to his service and protection rather than an uncontrolled mass of the party, such as the SA. Originally the unit was composed of only eight men, commanded by Schreck and Joseph Berchtold. It was designated the Stabswache ("Staff Guard"). The Stabswache were issued unique badges, but at this point the Stabswache was still under overall control of the SA, whose membership continued to increase. Schreck resurrected the use of the Totenkopf ("death's head") as the unit's insignia, a symbol various elite forces had <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> including specialized assault troops of Imperial Germany in World War I who used Hutier infiltration tactics.|$|E
