5|$|The odorless and {{tasteless}} thallium sulfate {{was once}} widely used as rat poison and ant killer. Since 1972 this <b>use</b> <b>has</b> been prohibited in the United States due to safety concerns. Many other countries followed this example in subsequent years. Thallium salts {{were used in}} the treatment of ringworm, other skin infections and to reduce the night sweating of tuberculosis patients. This <b>use</b> <b>has</b> been limited due to their narrow therapeutic index, and the development of improved medicines for these conditions.|$|E
5|$|Because of titanium's {{superior}} {{strength and}} light weight {{relative to other}} metals (steel, stainless steel, and aluminium), and because of recent advances in metalworking techniques, its <b>use</b> <b>has</b> become more widespread {{in the manufacture of}} firearms. Primary uses include pistol frames and revolver cylinders. For the same reasons, it is used in the body of laptop computers (for example, in Apple's PowerBook line).|$|E

5|$|Collection of the {{mushroom}} for culinary <b>use</b> <b>has</b> also {{been documented in}} Nepal. However, the Nepalese do not consider it a choice mushroom for eating; of the three grades given to edible mushrooms, it was given the worst. Again, unlike other mushrooms, no medicinal use was reported. The mushroom has also been the only non-morel species exported from Nepal for culinary use.|$|E
5|$|Falafel {{has become}} popular among vegetarians and vegans, as an {{alternative}} to meat-based street foods, and is now sold in packaged mixes in health-food stores. While traditionally thought of as being used to make veggie burgers, its <b>use</b> <b>has</b> expanded as more and more people have adopted it as a source of protein. In the United States, falafel's versatility has allowed for the reformulating of recipes for meatloaf, sloppy joes and spaghetti and meatballs into vegetarian dishes.|$|E
5|$|Fund {{accounting}} is {{an accounting}} system for recording resources whose <b>use</b> <b>has</b> been {{limited by the}} donor, grant authority, governing agency, or other individuals or organisations or by law. It emphasizes accountability rather than profitability, and is used by Nonprofit organizations and by governments. In this method, a fund consists of a self-balancing set of accounts and each are reported as either unrestricted, temporarily restricted or permanently restricted based on the provider-imposed restrictions.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, lead's {{toxicity}} was recognized, and its <b>use</b> <b>has</b> since been phased {{out of many}} applications. Lead is a neurotoxin that accumulates in soft tissues and bones, damages the nervous system, and causes blood disorders. It is particularly problematic in children: even if blood levels are promptly normalized with treatment, permanent brain damage may result.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the end of}} the Second World War, the hooden horse's <b>use</b> <b>has</b> been revived in Whitstable, {{where it}} is often brought out for the Jack in the Green festival each May, and is owned by a group called the Ancient Order of Hoodeners. Since 1981, the Tonbridge Mummers and Hoodeners have made use of a horse, {{incorporating}} it into a play specially written for the purpose by Doel and Nick Miller.|$|E

Many other top acts have made stops in the Saddledome, however {{the inability of the}} roof to support the massive light, speaker and special effect rigs that some performers currently <b>use</b> <b>has</b> led the city to again be bypassed for some major tours.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} diversities of bovids {{occur in}} Africa. The maximum concentration of species {{is in the}} savannas of eastern Africa. Other bovid species also occur in Europe, Asia, and North America. Bovidae includes {{three of the five}} domesticated mammals whose <b>use</b> <b>has</b> spread outside their original ranges, namely cattle, sheep, and goats. Dairy products such as milk, butter, and cheese are manufactured largely from domestic cattle. Bovids also provide leather, meat, and wool.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} gaseous or highly {{volatile}} brominated halomethane compounds are non-toxic and make superior fire suppressant agents by this same mechanism, and are particular effective in enclosed spaces such as submarines, airplanes, and spacecraft. However, they are expensive and their production and <b>use</b> <b>has</b> been greatly curtailed {{due to their}} effect as ozone-depleting agents. They are no longer used in routine fire extinguishers, but retain niche uses in aerospace and military automatic fire-suppression applications. They include bromochloromethane (Halon 1011, CH2BrCl), bromochlorodifluoromethane (Halon 1211, CBrClF2), and bromotrifluoromethane (Halon 1301, CBrF3).|$|E
5|$|A {{saturated}} solution of equal parts of thallium(I) formate (Tl(CHO2)) and thallium(I) malonate (Tl(C3H3O4)) in water {{is known as}} Clerici solution. It is a mobile, odorless liquid which changes from yellowish to colourless upon reducing the concentration of the thallium salts. With a density of 4.25g/cm3 at 20°C, Clerici solution {{is one of the}} heaviest aqueous solutions known. It was used in the 20th century for measuring the density of minerals by the flotation method, but its <b>use</b> <b>has</b> discontinued due to the high toxicity and corrosiveness of the solution.|$|E
5|$|A voltage {{applied to}} a human body causes an {{electric}} current through the tissues, and although the relationship is non-linear, the greater the voltage, the greater the current. The threshold for perception varies with the supply frequency and with {{the path of the}} current, but is about 0.1mA to 1mA for mains-frequency electricity, though a current as low as a microamp can be detected as an electrovibration effect under certain conditions. If the current is sufficiently high, it will cause muscle contraction, fibrillation of the heart, and tissue burns. The lack of any visible sign that a conductor is electrified makes electricity a particular hazard. The pain caused by an electric shock can be intense, leading electricity at times to be employed as a method of torture. Death caused by an electric shock is referred to as electrocution. Electrocution is still the means of judicial execution in some jurisdictions, though its <b>use</b> <b>has</b> become rarer in recent times.|$|E

5|$|ASL {{originated}} in the early 19th century in the American School for the Deaf (ASD) in Hartford, Connecticut, from a situation of language contact. Since then, ASL <b>use</b> <b>has</b> propagated widely via schools for the deaf and Deaf community organizations. Despite its wide use, no accurate count of ASL users has been taken, though reliable estimates for American ASL users range from 250,000 to 500,000 persons, including a number of children of deaf adults. ASL users face stigma due to beliefs in the superiority of oral language to sign language, {{compounded by the fact}} that ASL is often glossed in English due to the lack of a standard writing system.|$|E
5|$|As of {{the year}} 2000, about 15% of United States {{consumption}} of germanium was used for infrared optics technology and 50% for fiber-optics. Over the past 20 years, infrared <b>use</b> <b>has</b> consistently decreased; fiber optic demand, however, is slowly increasing. In America, 30–50% of current fiber optic lines are unused dark fiber, sparking discussion of over-production and a future reduction in demand. Worldwide, demand is increasing dramatically as countries such as China are installing fiber optic telecommunication lines throughout the country.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as being}} kept as pets, cats are also used in the {{international}} fur and leather industries for making coats, hats, blankets and stuffed toys; and shoes, gloves and musical instruments respectively (about 24 cats are {{needed to make a}} cat fur coat). This <b>use</b> <b>has</b> now been outlawed in the United States, Australia, and the European Union. Cat pelts have been used for superstitious purposes as part of the practise of witchcraft, and are still made into blankets in Switzerland as folk remedies believed to help rheumatism. In the Western intellectual tradition, the idea of cats as everyday objects have served to illustrate problems of quantum mechanics in the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment.|$|E
