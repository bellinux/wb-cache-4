40|$|Two {{configurations}} of radial static seals are developed for high-pressure 773 kg per sq cm cryogenic applications: a U-shaped fluorocarbon seal and a delta-shaped PTFE seal. The <b>U-seal</b> {{is a common}} commercial design consisting of a spring-loaded cup-shaped jacket; the basic principle is that the soft plastic jacket provides the interface between the piston and the bore, the jacket being {{held in place by}} a metal spring. The delta seal is based on the principle that the soft plastic delta cross section furnishes the interface at the metal face and circumferential face of the gland and cylinder. Test results indicate that both the plastic <b>U-seal</b> and the delta seal designs are sufficiently flexible to accommodate assembly in bore or piston grooves. Of these two configurations, the delta seal is found to be superior as it meets all the design requirements for proof pressure testing the turbopump components of the main engine in the Space Shuttle...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this article, {{an attempt}} was made to {{investigate}} the contact mechanics phenomenon of the reciprocating hydraulic <b>U-seal</b> by measuring friction forces at various pressures and velocities. The inlet fluctuating pressure and the rod speed was simultaneously performed at the peak pressures of 10, 20 and 30 MPa and the rod speeds of, 0. 12, 0. 3 and 0. 5 m/s. The distribution of the contact pressure at the seal/rod interface was calculated along the contact surface at pressures of 10, 20 and 30 MPa using FE model. Friction measurement of reciprocating seals by experimental results demonstrated that the velocity of the rod and seal pressure influences the seal performance considerably. Furthermore, the numerical analysis undertaken to determine the contact pressure to compute friction force was in good agreement with the experimental results...|$|E
