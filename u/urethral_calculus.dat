40|$|Urethral {{stones in}} adults are rare and usually {{encountered}} with urethral stricture or diverticulum. We report a 54 years old gentleman who presented with urinary retention {{due to a}} large <b>urethral</b> <b>calculus</b> impacted in bulbar urethra with multiple stones in anterior and posterior urethral diverticulum. On examination a mass of size 5. 5 cmx 4 cmx 3 cm was palpable at anterior perineum with a fistulous tract from which pus was oozing out. On retrograde urethrogram a large <b>urethral</b> <b>calculus</b> with bulbar diverticulum and multiple radio opacity in prostatic area were revealed. Patient was managed by suprapubic cystostomy initially and later on by external urethrotomy, diverticulectomy, urethroscopic removal of multiple stones in prostatic urethral diverticulum and urethroplasty.

40|$|We {{report a}} rare case of iliac vein {{compression}} syndrome caused by <b>urethral</b> <b>calculus.</b> A 71 -year-old {{man had a}} history of urethral stenosis. He complained of bilateral leg edema and dysuria for 1 week. Physical examination revealed bilateral distention of the superficial epigastric veins, so obstruction of both common iliac veins or the inferior vena cava was suspected. Plain abdominal computed tomography showed a calculus in the pendulous urethra, distention of the bladder (as well as the right renal pelvis and ureter), and compression of the bilateral common iliac veins by the distended bladder. Iliac vein compression syndrome was diagnosed. Bilateral iliac vein compression due to bladder distention (secondary to neurogenic bladder, benign prostatic hyperplasia, or <b>urethral</b> <b>calculus</b> as in this case) is an infrequent cause of acute bilateral leg edema.

40|$|Calculi in the urethra are an {{uncommon}} entity. Giant calculi in prostatic urethra are extremely rare. The decision about treatment strategy of calculi {{depends upon the}} size, shape, and position of the calculus {{and the status of}} the urethra. If the stone is large and immovable, it may be extracted via the perineal or the suprapubic approach. In most of the previous reported cases, giant calculi were extracted via the transvesical approach and external urethrotomy. A 38 -year-old male patient presented with complaints of lower urinary tract symptoms. Further investigations showed a giant <b>urethral</b> <b>calculus</b> secondary to stricture of bulbo-membranous part of the urethra. Surgical removal of calculus was done via transvesical approach.

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{our experience}} and results {{of using the}} MicroPerc™ micropercutaneous nephrolithotomy armamentarium (PolyDiagnost, Germany) for unusual indications unexplored using this modality. Patients and methods: We used the MicroPerc™ system for stone clearance in three ureteric calculi, two bladder calculi, one case of <b>urethral</b> <b>calculus,</b> for antegrade biopsy {{in a case of}} upper tract urothelial carcinoma, for Deflux® (dextranomer/hyaluronic copolymer, Salix Pharmaceuticals, Uppsala, Sweden) injection in three cases of vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR), and three cases of posterior urethral valve (PUV) fulgurations. A 4. 85 -F ‘All-Seeing Needle®’ (PolyDiagnost) was used in most of the cases. An 8 -F mini-micro sheath was used where stability was deemed necessary. Clinical data were collected in a dedicated database. Intraoperative variables, postoperative complications, and outcomes were assessed. Results: All patients were successfully treated with complete stone clearance at 1  month with no residual fragments. The antegrade biopsy confirmed a high-grade papillary neoplasm. There were no technical difficulties with injection of Deflux or PUV fulgurations. Follow-up at 1  year revealed no stone recurrence, resolved reflux in all three cases, and all the children that had had PUVs were voiding well. The small sample and retrospective nature of the analysis are the limitations of this study. Conclusion: MicroPerc™, besides its usual use for minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy, can also be feasibly used for ureteric, bladder and urethral stones, and for treating non-calculus diseases such as PUVs and VUR. True to its name, it may be an ‘All-Seeing Needle’ in reality with much more to offer and harvest from...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The {{prevalence}} of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) is about 20 % in men aged 40 or above. Other than {{benign prostatic hyperplasia}} (BPH), urethral diverticulum or calculus {{is not uncommon for}} LUTS in men. Surgical treatment is often recommended for urethral diverticulum or calculus, but treatment for an impacted <b>urethral</b> <b>calculus</b> complicated by a stone-containing diverticulum is challenging. Materials and Methods An 82 -year-old man had the persistence of LUTS despite having undergone transurethral resection of prostate for BPH. Regardless of treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics and an &# 945;-blocker, LUTS and post-void residual urine volume (100 mL) did not improve although repeated urinalysis showed reduction of WBCs from 100 to 10 per high power field. Further radiology revealed multiple urethral calculi and the stone configuration suggested the existence of a diverticulum. He was successfully treated without resecting the urethral diverticulum; and a new generation of ultrasound lithotripsy (EMS, Nyon, Switzerland) through a 22 F offset rigid Storz nephroscope (Karl Storz, Tuttingen, Germany) was used to fragment the stones. Results The operative time was 30 minutes and the stones were cleanly removed. The patient was discharged after 48 hours with no immediate complications and free of LUTS during a 2 years follow-up. Conclusions When the diverticulum {{is the result of a}} dilatation behind a calculus, removal of the calculus is all that is necessary. Compared with open surgery, ultrasound lithotripsy is less invasive with little harm to urethral mucosa; and more efficient as it absorbs stone fragments while crushing stones...|$|E
40|$|A {{statistical}} observation {{was made on}} 861 cases of urolithiasis experienced during the past thirty-two years, 1928 to 1959. 92 of them showed multilocation of stones in the urinary tract. They consisted of 221 cases (25. 6 %) of renal calculus, 291 (33. 7 %) of ureteral, 252 (29. 2 %) of vesical, 54 (6. 2 %) of urethral and 43 (4. 9 %) of prostatic. In the early period of above 32 years, calculus in the lo w er urinary tract showed higher incidence {{than that of the}} upper, but this ratio lately reversed with greatly increasing incidence of upper urinary tract calculus. Age distribution of calculus was 223 cases (25. 9 %) in the third decade, 182 (21. 1 %) in the fourth decade. In young adults, there were many cases of calculus of the upper urinary tract; on the other hand, there were many cases of the lower urinary tract calculus in the aged and children. 729 cas e s (84. 6 %) were male and 132 cases (15. 3 %) were female. The ratio of male to female on sites of stones was 3. 2 to 1 in renal calculus, 4. 2 to 1 in ureteral, 9. 1 to 1 in vesical and 54 to 0 in urethral. By occupations, farm er was in the first and business man was in the next place. In the upper urinary calculus, the ratio of renal to ureteral calculus was 1 to 1. 3. Affected side was a little more on the left than the right. Ureteral stones were found more in the lower ureter than in the upper or mid-ureter. Male to female ratio of upper urinary calculus was 3. 7 to 1, highest incidence of which was seen in the trird decade in both male and female. V e sical calculus showed highest incidence in the seventh decade and next in the fifth decade. It was interesting that 30 cases (11. 8 %) of vesical calculus were found in one to ten years of age. Urethral c alculus occupied 6. 8 % of all urinary calculus and was most frequent in one to sixten years of age, but there was no case of female. Prostatic calculus was mostly seen in man over 40 and occupied 5. 09 % of all urinary calculus. As far as the treatment of urolithiasis is concerned, in the early periods, those who received treatment for urinary calculus were only 44. 8 % of all the urolithiatic patients occupying 2. 4 % of outpatients. Recently, however, cases of urolithiasis have progressively increased and those who received treatment became more than 50 %. Treatment of urolithiasis was, as a whole, surgical. When t h ere was a stone only in the upper urinary tract operative treatment was common, but {{it should be noted that}} cases of spontaneous discharge or chemical dissolution of stones have been recently increasing. In cases of vesical or <b>urethral</b> <b>calculus,</b> endoscopic treatment was widely used; and in cases with prostatic calculus, treatment was all operative.
