25|$|Within National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT) this water-way misclassified, misnamed {{as a mere}} drain (Najafgarh drain or nallah) is, in fact, the {{continuation}} of Sahibi River and an elongation of the Najafgarh jheel Lake. Historically during the 1960s and before, the rain-fed Sahibi River which originates in Jaipur Distt. of Rajasthan passing through Alwar Distt. in Rajasthan and Gurgaon Distt. in Haryana entered <b>U.T.</b> <b>of</b> Delhi near Dhansa and spilled its overflow in the Najafgarh Jheel (lake) basin creating a seasonal lake, a vast area more than 300sq km was submerged in some seasons, this water then continued to flow {{on the other side}} forming a tributary and outfalled into River Yamuna. In the following decades this Sahibi River flow reaching Dhansa regulators was channelised by digging out a wide drain and connecting it directly to the River Yamuna, this in effect also completely drained off the seasonal Najafgarh Jheel which used to form here in the past. The drain channel from Dhansa regulators to Keshopur Bus Depot on Outer Ring Road is wide with thick and high embankments, vast amount of water is retained in this widened drain by closing the Kakrola regulators under Najafgarh Road to recharge the local ground watertable hence it acts like an elongated lake as well.|$|E
