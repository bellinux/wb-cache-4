5|$|American crows are common, widespread, and {{susceptible}} to the West Nile virus, making them <b>useful</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> bioindicator to track the virus's spread. Direct transmission of the virus from American crows to humans is unheard of and unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt-60 (Co-60 or 60Co) is <b>useful</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{gamma ray}} source {{because it can}} be {{produced}} in predictable quantity and high activity by bombarding cobalt with neutrons. It produces two gamma rays with energies of 1.17 and 1.33MeV.|$|E

5|$|Among brachiopods {{only the}} lingulids have been fished commercially, and {{only on a}} very small scale. Brachiopods seldom settle on {{artificial}} surfaces, probably because they are vulnerable to pollution. This may make the population of Coptothyrus adamsi <b>useful</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> measure of environmental conditions around an oil terminal being built in Russia {{on the shore of}} the Sea of Japan.|$|E
5|$|As a metal, {{titanium}} {{is recognized}} for its high strength-to-weight ratio. It {{is a strong}} metal with low density that is quite ductile (especially in an oxygen-free environment), lustrous, and metallic-white in color. The relatively high melting point (more than 1,650°C or 3,000°F) makes it <b>useful</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> refractory metal. It is paramagnetic and has fairly low electrical and thermal conductivity.|$|E
5|$|Convolution {{is used to}} add two {{independent}} random variables defined by distribution functions. Its usual definition combines integration, subtraction, and multiplication. In general, convolution is <b>useful</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> kind of domain-side addition; by contrast, vector addition {{is a kind of}} range-side addition.|$|E

5|$|In the 2013, the perturbational {{complexity}} index (PCI) was proposed, {{a measure}} of the algorithmic complexity of the electrophysiological response of the cortex to transcranial magnetic stimulation. This measure was shown to be higher in individuals that are awake, in REM sleep or in a locked-in state than in those who are in deep sleep or in a vegetative state, making it potentially <b>useful</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> quantitative assessment of consciousness states.|$|E
5|$|Long-term {{usage of}} non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{is associated with}} a reduced likelihood of developing AD. Evidence also supports the notion that NSAIDs can reduce inflammation related to amyloid plaques. No prevention trial has been completed. They {{do not appear to be}} <b>useful</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> treatment. Hormone replacement therapy, although previously used, may increase the risk of dementia.|$|E
5|$|No drug is {{currently}} approved {{for the treatment}} of smallpox. However, antiviral treatments have improved since the last large smallpox epidemics, and studies suggest that the antiviral drug cidofovir might be <b>useful</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> therapeutic agent. The drug must be administered intravenously, however, and may cause serious kidney toxicity.|$|E

5|$|TgPVR21 mice have {{incorporated}} the human PVR at chromosome 13. These mice are {{less susceptible to}} poliovirus infection through the intracerebral route, possibly because they express decreased levels of hPVR. TgPVR21 mice {{have been shown to}} be susceptible to poliovirus infection through intranasal inoculation, and may be <b>useful</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mucosal infection model.|$|E
5|$|The {{intended}} dive {{profile is}} <b>useful</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> planning tool {{as an indication}} of the risks of decompression sickness and oxygen toxicity for the exposure, and also for estimating the volume of open-circuit breathing gas needed for a planned dive, as these depend in part upon the depth and duration of the dive. A dive profile diagram is conventionally drawn with elapsed time running from left to right and depth increasing down the page.|$|E
5|$|The low {{weight and}} high {{rigidity}} of beryllium make it <b>useful</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> material for high-frequency speaker drivers. Because beryllium is expensive (many {{times more than}} titanium), hard to shape due to its brittleness, and toxic if mishandled, beryllium tweeters are limited to high-end home, pro audio, and public address applications. Some high-fidelity products have been fraudulently claimed {{to be made of}} the material.|$|E

5|$|There is {{currently}} {{no use for}} any isotope of berkelium outside basic scientific research. Berkelium-249 is a common target nuclide to prepare still heavier transuranic elements and transactinides, such as lawrencium, rutherfordium and bohrium. It is also <b>useful</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> source of the isotope californium-249, which is used for studies on the chemistry of californium in preference to the more radioactive californium-252 that is produced in neutron bombardment facilities such as the HFIR.|$|E
5|$|A simple {{record of}} depth {{and time for}} a dive is <b>useful</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> legal record of a diving operation, where this is required, {{and in the case}} of an {{accident}} during the dive, an accurately recorded dive profile can provide useful diagnostic information for treatment of the injured diver and for analysis of the circumstances leading to the accident and the action taken during and after the incident. A proposed dive profile is necessary for effective dive planning, both for estimating the required breathing gas composition and quantities, for planning decompression, and for choosing suitable diving equipment and other logistical aspects.|$|E
5|$|Another {{problem with}} the NIF lasers is that the flashtubes create a {{significant}} amount of heat, which warms the laser glass enough to cause it to deform. This requires a lengthy cooling-off period between shots, on the order of 12 hours. In practice, NIF manages a shot rate of less than one shot per day. To be <b>useful</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> power plant, about a dozen shots would have to take place every second, well beyond the capabilities of the NIF lasers.|$|E

5|$|Assonance, {{where the}} use of similar vowel sounds within a word rather than similar sounds at the {{beginning}} or end of a word, was widely used in skaldic poetry, but {{goes back to the}} Homeric epic. Because verbs carry much of the pitch in the English language, assonance can loosely evoke the tonal elements of Chinese poetry and so is useful in translating Chinese poetry. Consonance occurs where a consonant sound is repeated throughout a sentence without putting the sound only at the front of a word. Consonance provokes a more subtle effect than alliteration and so is less <b>useful</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> structural element.|$|E
5|$|Californium-252 has {{a number}} of {{specialized}} applications as a strong neutron emitter, and each microgram of fresh californium produces 139 million neutrons per minute. This property makes californium <b>useful</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> neutron startup source for some nuclear reactors and as a portable (non-reactor based) neutron source for neutron activation analysis to detect trace amounts of elements in samples. Neutrons from californium are employed as a treatment of certain cervical and brain cancers where other radiation therapy is ineffective. It has been used in educational applications since 1969 when the Georgia Institute of Technology received a loan of 119µg of californium-252 from the Savannah River Plant. It is also used with online elemental coal analyzers and bulk material analyzers in the coal and cement industries.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius subdulcis has a mild {{taste with}} a {{slightly}} bitter after-taste. Though considered edible after cooking, it is not recommended, as it has a taste reminiscent of ivy. There {{are a number of}} other mushrooms that appear at the same time and in the same areas as L.subdulcis that are preferable to it, including L.mitissimus, meaning that L.subdulcis is not particularly <b>useful</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> foodstuff. The milk is one of distinguishing features, having a sweet taste that turns bitter in the mouth, with L.subdulcis being considered a sweet milk mushroom.|$|E
