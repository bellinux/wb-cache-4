40|$|Purpose: To {{review the}} {{association}} of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in individuals manifesting thalidomide embry-opathy and Möbius sequence and compare them with three new studies in which ASD was also associated with ocular and systemic malformations: (1) a Swedish study of individuals with CHARGE association (Coloboma, Heart, choanal Atresia, developmental or growth Retardation, Genital anomaly, and Ear involvement); (2) a Swedish study of Goldenhar syndrome; and (3) Brazilian Möbius syndrome (sequence) study. Methods: In the Swedish CHARGE study, 31 patients met the inclusion criteria (3 + or 4 of the common characteristics of the CHARGE syndrome). The same team of investigators also evaluated 20 Swedish patients with Goldenhar syndrome. In the Brazilian Möbius study, 28 children with a diagnosis of Möbius sequence were studied; some children {{had a history of}} exposure during their mother’s pregnancy to the abortifacient drug misoprostol in an <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>abortion</b> attempt Results: In the CHARGE study, five patients had the more severe autism disorder and five had autistic-like condition. In the Goldenhar study, two had autism disorder and one had autistic-like condition. In the Brazilian Möbius study, the systemic findings of the misoprostol-exposed and misoprostol-unexposed patients were almost undistinguishable, and ASD was present in both groups (autism disorder in five and autistic-like condition in three). Conclusion: Autism spectrum disorder has been reported in two conditions with known early pregnancy exposure to the teratogenic agents thalidomide and misoprostol. In the Brazilian Möbius study, autism also occurred in both the miso-prostol-exposed and misoprostol-unexposed groups. Autism also was present in patients with both CHARGE associa-tion and Goldenhar syndrome. Trans Am Ophthalmol Soc 2004; 102 : 107 - 12...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Secondary {{abdominal}} pregnancies usually {{develop as}} a result of a tubal abortion, tubal rupture or uterine rupture with intraabdominal implantation. Case Report: We report a 40 -year-old patient gravida IV, para III suffering from abdominal pain. She was in the 29 th week of gestation according to a 14 thweek normal sonogram. She had unsuccessfully attempted to induce abortion with the assistance of a home midwife in the 14 th week. This caused severe abdominal pain, but she chose not to be hospitalized because of fear of prosecution. Ultrasound demonstrated that the fetus was out of the uterus and revealed a heterogeneous mass in the left lower quadrant. Laparotomy revealed an area of thin fibrotic scar behind the uterus with normal tubes and ovaries. The fetus in the amniotic sac was surrounded by intestinal loops. The placenta, implanted behind the left broad ligament at the edge of the scar area was removed with a brisk bleeding, which was controlled. No postoperative complications were observed. Conclusion: Presence of little free fluid and a uterine scar with normal fallopian tubes against a history of an <b>unsuccessful</b> induced <b>abortion</b> and severe illness are highly suggestive of a uterine rupture resulting in secondary implantation on the broad ligament. This is probably the first case that shows an abdominal pregnancy can result from <b>unsuccessful</b> induced <b>abortion.</b> In the countries where abortion is not permitted, patients with low socioeconomic status are prone to the dangerous consequences of illegal attempts to induce abortion. Close observation and special follow-up care are necessary in such cases...|$|R
40|$|Heterotopic {{pregnancy}} (HP) is the co-existence of intrauterine and ectopic pregnancies; {{it is said}} to be rare.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to explore the association between diverse factors occurring {{during the first year of}} a child?s life and the quality of life later as an adult. The design was a prospective cohort study based on material from the Copenhagen Birth Cohort 1959 – 61 with 7, 222 participants and two sets of questionnaires used: one by a physician during the child's first year and one by the ?adult child? 31 – 33 years later. The results showed that a mother's attitude towards her pregnancy, <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>abortions,</b> and/or institutionalization left a permanent trace on the child, since these children, as adults, have a quality of life 3 % below the average. Meningitis during the first year of life resulted in a quality of life 11. 7 % below the average, while other illnesses or accidents did not have an effect. The largest associations were found with psychomotor development, where “walking with support” showed a difference of 14. 2 % in overall quality of life between the fastest and slowest group. Generally, diet is not correlated with quality of life, however, we find a small, but essential, correlation between the quality of life of the adult and the early cessation of suckling (4 %). Full-time institutionalization during the first year of life showed a connection with the quality of life of the adult (7. 1 %). It is concluded that our quality of life, health and ability as adults are primarily determined by what we ourselves choose to do with our lives as young people and as adults - and only to a marginal degree determined by factors related to our background. This suggests that we as adults have a great freedom to achieve a good life despite our experiences in the beginning of life...|$|R

Thus, the number of organ transplant women at their reproductive age has also increased. We sought to investigate the allograft and obstetric outcomes in pregnant kidney recipients. Materials and Methods: Seventy-four kidney recipient women with 95 conceptions during their posttransplant period were evaluated. Pregnancy outcome, kidney allograft function, and maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications were evaluated in these patients. Results: The mean interval between kidney transplantation and pregnancy was 41. 0 ± 9. 5 months. Twenty-three pregnancies (24. 2 %) were <b>unsuccessful</b> due to <b>abortion</b> and stillbirth. The mean birth weight was 2385. 0 ± 161. 7 g and 45 newborns (62. 5 %) had a birth weight less than 2500 g (low birth weight). The mean Apgar score of the live babies was 7. 9 ± 0. 7. Forty-four (61. 1 %) babies were admitted to neonatal intensive care unit and early neonatal death happened in 4 (5. 5 %). Fifteen mothers (15. 78 %) had an uneventful perinatal period. The most common maternal complications in the 95 pregnancies were anemia in 62 (65. 3 %) and preeclampsia in 45 (47. 4 %). Three patients 3 (3. 2 %) lost their graft and 6 (6. 3 %) had impaired kidney allograft function 2 years after pregnancy. Conclusion: Pregnant kidney allograft recipients should be considered as high-risk patients needing special care under the supervision of a team of obstetricians and nephrologists. </p...|$|R
40|$|Two {{features}} of the legal regulation of childhood seem troublesome, but ultimately contribute to sensible policies in most contexts. First, the boundary between childhood and adulthood varies in different policy domains, through a regime of age grading under which elementary school students are deemed adults for some legal purposes, while, for other purposes, college students are children. Second, the transitional stage of adolescence is virtually invisible, because, for most purposes, law makers employ binary categories, classifying adolescents as either children or as adults. This framework - a series of legislative bright line rules, arrayed around a presumptive age of majority - generally promotes social welfare {{as well as the}} interests of youth. Although this approach sometimes distorts developmental reality, it accomplishes thetransition from legal childhood to adulthood over time without incurring the costs associated with the creation of intermediate legal category. Indeed, the <b>unsuccessful</b> experience with <b>abortion</b> regulation (in which adolescents occupy a special category) confirms the benefits of binary classification. In the context of juvenile justice policy, however, categorical assumptions that ignore the developmental stage of adolescence have harmful outcomes. In responding to youth crime, law makers have shifted the boundary of childhood dramatically during the 20 th century. TheProgressive architects of the traditional juvenile court described delinquent youths as innocent children, and constructed policies that presumed that the state 2 ̆ 7 s sole purpose was to promote their welfare. Contemporary conservatives, in contrast, assume that young offenders are indistinguishable from adult criminals, and argue that public protection demands that they be subject to the same punishment. I argue that both of these accounts represent distortions and have been the basis of unsatisfactory policies - even in terms of the professed objectives oftheir adherents. A justice policy that treats adolescence as a distinct legal category not only will promote youth welfare, but will also advance the utilitarian objectives of reducing the costs of youth crime...|$|R
