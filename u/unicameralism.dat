500|$|While {{there had}} been legislatures with more than two {{chambers}} (tricameral and tetracameral ones), nowadays there are only unicameral and bicameral ones. Additionally, there are also differences {{in the degree of}} bicameralism. Whereas Italy is considered as having [...] "perfect bicameralism", with both chambers being equal, most other bicameral systems restrict the upper house's powers to a certain extent. There is a slight trend towards unicameralism; some upper houses have seen their powers reduced or proposals to that end. Belgium's system has been reduced from a perfectly bicameral one to a nowadays de facto unicameral system. In 2009, Romania voted in favour of <b>unicameralism,</b> on a plebiscite, however the country still has a bicameral system, as of [...] On the other hand, Ireland narrowly voted against abolishing their upper house in 2013, and Italy voted not to reduce its Senate's powers in 2016.|$|E

50|$|Because of {{legislative}} gridlock in 2009, former Congressman Rick Lazio, a prospective candidate for governor, has proposed that New York adopt <b>unicameralism.</b>|$|E
50|$|Tricameralism is the {{practice}} of having three legislative or parliamentary chambers. It is contrasted to <b>unicameralism</b> and bicameralism, {{both of which are}} far more common.|$|E
50|$|In government, <b>unicameralism</b> (Latin , one + , chamber) is the {{practice}} of having one legislative or parliamentary chamber. Thus, a unicameral parliament or unicameral legislature is a legislature which consists of one chamber or house.|$|E
50|$|Tetracameralism (tetra-, four + camera, chamber) is the {{practice}} of having four legislative or parliamentary chambers. It is contrasted to <b>unicameralism</b> and bicameralism, which are far more common, and tricameralism, which is rarely used in government. No state currently has a tetracameral system.|$|E
50|$|In this Constitution the Catholic Church {{ceased to}} be the {{official}} religion.

50|$|Under Soviet regime {{regional}} and local Soviets were unicameral. After the adoption of 1993 Russian Constitution bicameralism was introduced in some regions. Bicameral regional legislatures are still technically allowed by federal law but this clause is dormant now. The last region to switch from bicameralism to <b>unicameralism</b> was Sverdlovsk Oblast in 2012.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{advantage of}} a unicameral system is more efficient lawmaking, as the legislative process is much simpler {{and there is no}} possibility of deadlock. Proponents of <b>unicameralism</b> have also argued that it reduces costs, even if the number of legislators stay the same, since there are fewer institutions to maintain and support it.|$|E
50|$|A new {{election}} for a constituent assembly {{was held on}} 2 June 1946, marked by a strengthening of the MRP {{and the decline of}} the left. The constitutional project then shifted from pursuing <b>unicameralism</b> to bicameralism. The constitution of the Fourth Republic, established under the chairmanship of Georges Bidault (MRP), was finally adopted by the 13 October 1946 referendum.|$|E
50|$|Lacking {{the two-thirds}} {{majority}} necessary {{in both houses}} of the Legislature to submit constitutional amendments to the electorate, in 2004 the Popular Democratic Party's then-majority approved legislation to hold a referendum, not on a particular constitutional amendment as such, but on the general concept of switching from a bicameral to a unicameral system which was held on July 10, 2005. Attended by less than 25% of the islands' electorate, Puerto Rican voters approved the change to a unicameral legislature by 456,267 votes in favor, versus 88,720 against. (Voter turnout was 22.6% of the electorate.) Almost four years later, incoming Governor Luis Fortuño (from the New Progressive Party or New Party of Progress (NPP)) discarded the alternative of <b>unicameralism</b> claiming that the NPP's platform, rather than advocating <b>unicameralism,</b> supported submitting to the people a constitutional amendment proposing a substantial reduction in seats in the existing bicameral legislature.|$|E
5000|$|Until 1953, the Rigsdag in Denmark was {{similarly}} divided into the [...] "Folketing" [...] and [...] "Landsting", but {{has since become}} a unicameral legislature. The same goes with Sweden and its [...] "Riksdag" [...] until 1971. The Norwegian parliament (Storting) was officially divided in two chambers 1814-2009, but functioned as a single chamber in practice, a situation called Qualified <b>unicameralism.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{bicameral}} {{legislature is}} one in which the legislators are divided into two separate assemblies, chambers or houses. Bicameralism is distinguished from <b>unicameralism,</b> in which all of the members deliberate and vote as a single group, and from some legislatures which have three or more separate assemblies, chambers or houses. As of 2015, somewhat {{less than half of the}} world's national legislatures are bicameral.|$|E
50|$|Though {{the current}} Congress of the Philippines is bicameral, the country {{experienced}} <b>unicameralism</b> in 1898 and 1899 during the First Philippine Republic, from 1935 to 1941 during the Commonwealth Era and from 1943 to 1944 during the Japanese occupation. Under the 1973 Constitution, the legislative body was called Batasang Pambansa, which functioned also a unicameral legislature within a semi-presidential system {{form of government}} until 1986.|$|E
50|$|With {{the passing}} of the Newfoundland Act of 1847 by the British Parliament,the members of the Legislative Council once again sat {{separately}} from the assembly, ending the experiment with <b>unicameralism</b> started in 1842.

For the second session which started in 1850, the assembly met in the newly constructed Colonial Building.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to <b>unicameralism,</b> multicameralism is the {{condition in which}} a legislature is divided into several deliberative assemblies, which are commonly called [...] "chambers" [...] or [...] "houses". This can include bicameralism with two chambers, tricameralism with three, tetracameralism with four branches, or a system with any amount more. The word [...] "multicameral" [...] can also relate in other ways to its literal meaning of [...] "many chambered" [...] with use in science or biology.|$|E

50|$|During {{his term}} as Governor of the State of Minnesota, Jesse Ventura {{proposed}} converting the Minnesotan legislature {{to a single}} chamber with proportional representation, as a reform that he felt would solve many legislative difficulties and impinge upon legislative corruption. In his book on political issues, Do I Stand Alone?, Ventura argued that bicameral legislatures for provincial and local areas were excessive and unnecessary, and discussed <b>unicameralism</b> as a reform that could address many legislative and budgetary problems for states.|$|E
5000|$|The Norwegian parliament, the Storting, has {{historically}} been divided into two chambers named the Lagting and the Odelsting, which translates loosely into the [...] "Thing of the Law" [...] and the [...] "Thing of the Lords". However, {{for much of the}} Storting's recent history, the division into Lagting and Odelsting has been mostly ceremonial, and the Storting has generally operated as a unicameral parliament. A constitutional amendment passed in February 2007 abolished the Lagting and Odelsting, making this de facto <b>unicameralism</b> official following the 2009 election.|$|E
50|$|Act No. 477 of September 23, 2004 {{provided}} for a referendum {{to be held}} on July 10, 2005, in which Puerto Rican voters were to indicate if they favored changing the Legislative Assembly to a single house, or maintain the bicameral legislature established by the 1917 Jones Act, which had been retained (with modifications) by the 1952 Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. A vote for <b>unicameralism</b> would constitute a mandate for the Legislative Assembly to hold a second referendum on July 9, 2007 on the constitutional amendment that would establish a unicameral legislature by 2009.|$|E
50|$|The {{ongoing process}} of {{amending}} or revising the current Constitution and {{form of government}} is popularly known as Charter Change. A shift to a unicameral parliament {{was included in the}} proposals of the constitutional commission created by former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Unlike in the United States, senators in the Senate of the Philippines are elected not per district and state but nationally; the Philippines is a unitary state. The Philippine government's decision-making process, relative to the United States, is more rigid, highly centralised, much slower and susceptible to political gridlock. As a result, the trend for <b>unicameralism</b> as well as other political system reforms are more contentious in the Philippines.|$|E
50|$|Various {{organizations}} {{pushed for}} changing the legislative assembly from the current two-chamber system (House and Senate) prevalent in 49 of the 50 states of the nation to one-chamber (<b>unicameralism).</b> The reasons for this proposed change {{was based on the}} growing public opinion that members of the assembly are overpaid, and that a smaller assembly might achieve the same work results as the bicameral one with less public expenditures. However, an official report of 1995 indicates that this argument should not be considered the primary objective because the savings are not significant. The legislative spending in Puerto Rico, compared with the consolidated government budget is less than 1% of total government spending.|$|E
50|$|After the Liberal Revolution (1820) and the {{suppression}} of religious orders in Portugal (1834), the monks were expelled from the monastery and the Portuguese Parliament was installed in the building, then called Palácio das Cortes or Parlamento. From then on, the old monastery was systematically adapted to its new functions. The first architect in charge was Possidónio da Silva, who designed the first session rooms.The Chapter house (meeting place of the monks) of the monastery was totally remodelled by French architect Jean François Colson into a session room in 1867. The Portuguese Chamber of Peers met here until 1910, followed by the Senate and later the Corporative Chamber in this room, until the 1976 Constitution established <b>unicameralism.</b>|$|E
50|$|Unicameral legislatures exist {{when there}} is no widely {{perceived}} need for multicameralism. Many multicameral legislatures were created to give separate voices to different sectors of society. Multiple chambers allowed for guaranteed representation of different social classes (as in the Parliament of the United Kingdom or the French States-General), ethnic or regional interests, or subunits of a federation. Where these factors are unimportant, in unitary states with limited regional autonomy, <b>unicameralism</b> often prevails. Sometimes, as in New Zealand and Denmark, this comes about through the abolition of one of the two chambers, or, as in Sweden, through the merger of the two chambers into a single one, while in others a second chamber has never existed.|$|E
50|$|In the unicameral {{referendum}} held on July 10, 2005, Puerto Rican {{voters approved}} {{a mandate for}} the Legislative Assembly to hold a second referendum on the constitutional amendment that would establish unicameral legislature by 456,267 votes in favor, versus 88,720 against; voter turnout was only 22.6%, the lowest turnout figure in Puerto Rico's electoral history, vastly below the 81.7% that {{had gone to the}} polls just a few months earlier for the general election. Another referendum was scheduled for July 2007 to approve the specific amendments to the Constitution of Puerto Rico that are required for the change. However, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico ruled in June that it could not force the Legislative Assembly to initiate a constitutional amendment process to become a single chamber legislature. Further moves to <b>unicameralism</b> have been tabled.|$|E
5000|$|Doing {{away with}} the Spanish {{autonomic}} state. UPyD wants Spain to adopt a system of symmetric federalism with broad political centralization as a territorial model, clearly defining in the Constitution which powers are exclusive of the State and which ones are transferable to autonomous communities or municipalities. The party wants to centralize competences that concern citizens' fundamental rights like education, health and justice among others because the State of Autonomies, besides creating nationwide inequalities, {{is considered to be}} [...] "elephantine, politically unviable and economically unsustainable". Another aspect of UPyD's symmetric federalism is the abolition of Navarre's and the Basque Country's chartered regimes, establishing a common system of funding for all autonomous communities. Other noteworthy proposals are municipal mergers so that municipalities have a minimum dimension of 20,000 inhabitants, the suppression of the provincial councils (diputaciones provinciales), chartered councils (diputaciones forales), Basque General Assemblies (Juntas Generales vascas) and district councils (comarcas), and the <b>unicameralism</b> of the Spanish General Courts after eliminating the Senate.|$|E
50|$|With time, the {{newspaper}} {{had moved from}} advocating King Carol's replacement with a local ruler to supporting republicanism. In 1893, {{as part of its}} extended campaign, during which it gathered letters of protest from its readers, Adevărul obtained the cancellation of plans for a public subscription to celebrate the engagement of Crown Prince Ferdinand to Marie of Edinburgh. In addition, Adevărul began militating for a number of major social and political causes, which it perceived as essential to democracy. In its 15 points of 1888, it notably demanded universal suffrage to replace the census method enshrined in the 1866 Constitution, <b>unicameralism</b> through a disestablishment of the Senate, a land reform to replace leasehold estates, self-governance at a local level, progressive taxation, Sunday rest for employees, universal conscription instead of a permanent under arms force, women's rights, emancipation for Romanian Jews. It embraced the cause of Romanians living outside the Old Kingdom, particularly those in Austro-Hungarian-ruled Transylvania, while calling for Romania to separate itself from its commitment to the Triple Alliance, and advocating a Balkan Federation to include Romania.|$|E
5000|$|The Constitution of 1856 {{unequivocally}} re-established royal sovereignty. [...] "Sovereign power {{resides in}} the person of the King-Grand Duke …." [...] The Chamber of Deputies again assumed its old name of an [...] "Assembly of Estates". It lost its power over the annual budget and taxes, the right to elect its president, the right to meet beyond a brief period when summoned, as well as the right to respond to speeches from the throne with an address. The members of the government were no longer responsible to the parliament. The Constitution of 1856 strongly reinforced executive power, and weakened the national elected representatives. In order to counterbalance the drawbacks of <b>unicameralism,</b> William III created the Council of State, whose members were appointed by the King and which shared legislative power with the Assembly of Estates. The revision of 1856 also subordinated national law to federal law. The members of the Constituent Assembly of 1848, conscious of the danger of being absorbed by the German unification movement, had confined themselves to stating that Luxembourg [...] "is part of the Confederation, in line with existing treaties". The text of 1856 declared that [...] "the Grand Duchy … is part of the Germanic Confederation and participates in the rights and duties of the federal Constitution". This meant that the restrictive laws on the press and associations in force in Germany were applicable in Luxembourg. For a short while, after the revision of the Constitution, the government worked without the legislature, by making use of decrees. It enacted around forty decrees on the press, the electoral system, the pay and status of civil servants, the internal order of the Assembly of Estates, the organisation of the courts, the cadaster, the Chamber of accounts, the communes and the militia.|$|E
40|$|The study {{approaches}} the way Romanian bicameralism functions, considering both its strengths and weaknesses. In addition, the unicameral parliamentary system {{is presented in}} relation to the bicameral one. In the doctrine, there are several opinions according to which bicameralism is preferred to <b>unicameralism,</b> because the two Houses provide increased safety, as the concentration of legislative power in one place could be both dangerous and, often, unjustified. But the two Chambers should not be similar, as this would not serve their guaranteeing purpose. Furthermore, bicameralism consolidates the balance and solidity of democratic regimes, providing a better separation of powers...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explains}} coalition {{formation in}} presidential regimes with evidence from Latin America. The conventional view {{has been that}} coalition formation is considerably difficult in presidentialism, and as a result, parties have only exceptionally been expected to form coalitions. However, since the 1990 s, the frequency of coalition formation has increased across the region. Most democracies have at some point elected a presidential candidate backed by an electoral coalition, or have been ruled by a president backed by a government coalition. This thesis presents three major findings {{that contribute to the}} development of a theory of coalition formation in presidential regimes. First, it shows that simple majority plurality for presidential elections, <b>unicameralism,</b> proportional representation, larger legislatures, smaller average district magnitudes, a higher effective number of electoral parties, and the government party’s legislative majority are crucial predictors of electoral coalition formation. It also shows that when an outsider presidential candidate is present, the likelihood of electoral coalition formation decreases. Second, this thesis shows that weak presidents elected with a low vote share are more likely to form government coalitions. It shows that simple majority plurality for presidential elections, longer presidential terms, <b>unicameralism,</b> smaller legislatures, and fewer legislative parties are crucial predictors of government coalition formation. It also shows that when the incumbent president was backed by an electoral coalition in the immediately previous election, or when the government is going through political turmoil, the probability of forming a government coalition increases. Third, it shows that coalitions may or may not form even when variables related to presidential power, electoral institutions, electoral systems, and party systems are not perfectly aligned. It shows that while presidential power is relevant, electoral arrangements and the party system are what ultimately determine coalition formation. While the former variable is a sufficient condition, the latter variables are both sufficient and necessary conditions. Finally, this thesis shows that political culture and critical junctures play an important role in exacerbating or ameliorating these structural incentives...|$|E
