40|$|The {{oxidation}} of {{dust and}} flakes collected from the DIII-D tokamak, and various commercial dust specimens, has been measured at 350 ºC and 2. 0 kPa O 2 pressure. Following an initial small mass loss, most of the commercial dust specimens showed very little effect due to O 2 exposure. Similarly, dust collected from underneath DIII-D tiles, which is thought to comprise largely Grafoil™ particulates, also showed little susceptibility to oxidation at this temperature. However, oxidation of the dust collected from tile surfaces has led to ~ 18 % mass loss after 8 hours; thereafter, little change in mass was observed. This suggests that the surface dust includes some components of different composition and/or structure – possibly fragments of codeposited layers. The oxidation of codeposit flakes scraped form DIII-D <b>upper</b> divertor <b>tiles</b> showed an initial 25 % loss in mass due to heating in vacuum, and the gradual loss of 30 - 38 % mass during the subsequent 24 hours exposure to O 2. This behavior is significantly different from that observed for the oxidation of thinner DIII-D codeposit specimens which were still adhered to tile surfaces, and this {{is thought to be}} related to the low deuterium content (D/C ~ 0. 03 – 0. 04) of the flakes...|$|R
40|$|The {{architectural}} {{heritage of the}} city of Barcelona in its older neighbourhoods of historic importance consists largely of buildings whose roof is formed by the Catalan vault. This roof type consists of vaults built in ceramic blocks, supported by unidirectional beams, wherein the space between the vaults and the upper floor is filled with ceramic material and/or construction waste. Over time, these structures presented problems of thermal and acoustic insulation, as well as of load distribution, causing the detachment of the <b>upper</b> floor <b>tiles</b> in buildings with multiple floors. In order to solve this problem, a lightweight self-compacting concrete reinforced with plastic fibres was developed to replace the existing lightweight material. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present the experimental results obtained during the pumping of the lightweight aggregate concrete produced. Expanded clay in the dry condition was used. A density close to 1, 600 kg/m 3 was achieved, as well as a compressive strength higher than 17 MPa at 28 days.

40|$|This is {{a report}} on the {{excavations}} undertaken in 2007 at the site of Praisos in Eastern Crete. Three trenches were opened just next to the so-called Andreion or Almond Tree House on the NW slopes of the First Acropolis, excavated by R. C. Bosanquet in 1901. The upper layers of two of these trenches (A- 200 and A- 300) comprised re-deposited material of Classical and Hellenistic date, which we infer came from Bosanquet’s dump. Material from these <b>upper</b> layers comprised <b>tile,</b> pottery (including numerous examples of Cretan necked cups), loomweights and terracotta plaques with a distinct masculine iconography. Excavation also reached lower Late/Classical-Hellenistic floor levels, on which a number of pithoi survived in situ. Some of these pithoi are considerably older than the floor level, a terminus post quem for which is provided by a bronze coin. The abandonment of these houses must be dated to the final phases of Praisos’s occupation, before 146 BC. There is however nothing to suggest that the city itself was subject to a fire destruction. Rather, the city seems to have undergone a forced abandonment followed by deliberate demolition...|$|R
40|$|Divertor tiles removed {{after the}} second JET ITER-Like Wall {{campaign}} 2013 – 2014 (ILW- 2) were studied using Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS). Measurements show that the thickest beryllium (Be) dominated deposition layers are located at {{the upper part of}} the inner divertor and are up to ∼ 40 µm thick at the lower part of Tile 0 exposed in 2011 – 2014. The highest deuterium (D) amounts (> 8 [*]·[*] 10 ^ 18 at. /cm^ 2), in contrast, were found on the <b>upper</b> part of <b>Tile</b> 1 (2013 – 2014), where the Be deposits are ∼ 10 µm thick.

D retention for the ILW- 2 divertor tiles is higher than for the first campaign 2011 – 2012 (ILW- 1) and probable reasons for the difference are that SIMS measurements for the ILW- 2 samples were done deeper than for the ILW- 1 samples, some of the tiles were exposed during both ILW- 1 and ILW- 2 and therefore had a longer exposure time, and the differences between ILW- 1 and ILW- 2 campaigns e. g. in strike point distributions and injected powers...|$|R
40|$|In October 2014, JET {{completed}} a scoping study involving high power scenario development {{in preparation for}} DT along with other experiments critical for ITER. These experiments have involved intentional and unintentional melt damage both to bulk beryllium main chamber tiles and to divertor tiles. This paper {{provides an overview of}} the findings of concern for machine protection in JET and ITER, illustrating each case with high resolution images taken by remote handling or after removal from the machine. The bulk beryllium <b>upper</b> dump plate <b>tiles</b> and some other protection tiles have been repeatedly flash melted by what we believe to be mainly fast unmitigated disruptions. The flash melting produced in this way is seen at all toroidal locations and the melt layer is driven by j × B forces radially outward and upwards against gravity. In contrast, the melt pools caused while attempting to use MGI to mitigate deliberately generated runaway electron beams are localized to several limiters and the ejected material appears less influenced by j × B forces and shows signs of boiling. In the divertor, transient melting of bulk tungsten by ELMs was studied in support of the ITER divertor material decision using a specially prepared divertor module containing an exposed edge. Removal of the module from the machine in 2015 has provided improved imaging of the melt and this confirms that the melt layers are driven by ELMs. No other melt damage to the other 9215 bulk tungsten lamellas has yet been observed...|$|R

This study aimed to better understand how ocean acidification may affect the community composition and diversity of bacterial biofilms on surfaces under naturally reduced pH conditions. Settlement tiles were deployed at coral reefs in Papua New Guinea along pH gradients created by two CO 2 seeps, and <b>upper</b> and lower <b>tiles</b> surfaces were sampled 5 and 13 months after deployment. Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis were used to characterize more than 200 separate bacterial communities, complemented by amplicon sequencing of the bacterial 16 S rRNA gene of 16 samples. The bacterial biofilm consisted predominantly of Alpha-, Gamma- and Deltaproteobacteria, as well as Cyanobacteria, Flavobacteriia and Cytophaga, whereas putative settlement-inducing taxa only accounted for {{a small fraction of}} the community. Bacterial biofilm composition was heterogeneous with approximately 25 % shared operational taxonomic units between samples. Among the observed environmental parameters, pH only had a weak effect on community composition (R² ~ 1 %) and did not affect community richness and evenness. In contrast, there were strong differences between upper and lower surfaces (contrasting in light exposure and grazing intensity). There also appeared to be a strong interaction between bacterial biofilm composition and the macroscopic components of the tile community. Our results suggest that on mature settlement surfaces in situ, pH does not have a strong impact on the composition of bacterial biofilms. Other abiotic and biotic factors such as light exposure and interactions with other organisms may be more important in shaping bacterial biofilms than changes in seawater pH...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Civil EngineeringAlok BhandariIn the <b>upper</b> Midwest, {{subsurface}} <b>tile</b> {{drainage water}} is a major contributor of nitrate (NO[subscript] 3 –N) coming from fertilizers and animal manure. Movement of NO[subscript] 3 -N through tile drainage into streams {{is a major concern}} as it can cause eutrophication and hypoxia conditions, as in the Gulf of Mexico. Denitrifying bioreactors is one of the pollution control strategies to treat contaminated tile drainage water. These bioreactors require four conditions which are: 1) organic carbon source, 2) anaerobic conditions, 3) denitrifying bacteria and 4) influent NO[subscript] 3 -N. This research focuses on investigating fate of veterinary antibiotics in woodchips commonly used in in-situ reactors. Tylosin (TYL) and sulfamethazine (SMZ) are two veterinary antibiotics which are most commonly used in the United States and can be found in tile water after manure is land applied. Partition coefficients of TYL and SMZ on wood were determined by sorption experiments using fresh woodchips and woodchips from an in situ reactor. It was concluded that the woodchips were an effective means to sorb the veterinary antibiotics leached into the tile water after application of animal manure. Linear partition coefficients were calculated and phase distribution relationships were established for both the chemicals. The fresh woodchips gave inconclusive data but predictions could be made by the information determined in the experiments using woodchips from a ten year old woodchip bioreactor. Desorption was also studied and the likelihood of desorption was predicted using the Apparent Hysteresis Index. Overall, {{it was found that the}} old woodchips allowed for quick sorption of both antibiotics. It was also found that SMZ had reversible sorption on old woodchips. Thus, it was concluded that the woodchip bioreactor would not be effective for removal of veterinary antibiotics from tile drainage. More research is required for the fate of TYL and to confirm the conclusion...|$|R

This bird was the first recorded sighting for the county and the second documented record for Nebraska (NEB 52 : 72 - 73). On 26 September 1987 the authors observed and photographed a Red Phalarope along the beach near the group camping area {{on the south side}} of Willow Creek Recreation Area. The bird was quite unwary, and at one instance we were able to approach it within two yards distance as the bird swam and foraged near the water 2 ̆ 7 s edge. The bird was intermediate between immature and fall plumage. as the neck, breast, and crown were brownish buff, while <b>tile</b> <b>upper</b> wing feathers were quite gray. A brownish-black eye stripe, starting just in front of the eye, ran horizontally through the orbit to the rear of the cheek. The forehead, throat, lower face, and underparts were whitish in color, while the bird 2 ̆ 7 s upper back and primaries were a mottled brown. In flight the white wing stripes were clearly evident. The bill was dark and noticeably heavier in appearance than that of a Red-necked Phalarope - a species seen in the same location two days prior. When first found, the Phalarope was actively foraging among the plants on the water 2 ̆ 7 s edge and continued to do so throughout our presence. At times it would get up and fly to another feeding area, although the distances covered by these flights were never more than 20 yards.

40|$|Published {{observations}} on the toroidal oscillations of the earth are critically reviewed. A supplementary analysis of the record obtained by the Lamont strain seismometer is presented. Eleven toroidal modes are identified, and it is concluded that the periods are known to within 1 per cent. A perturbation scheme involving {{the ratio of the}} angular velocity of the earth to the resonant frequency is used in calculating the effects due to the rotation of the earth on the resonant frequency. The free oscillations are viewed as a superposition of traveling waves. In a nonrotating system two traveling waves combine to produce a stationary standing wave. In a rotating system, the rotation distinguishes between waves that travel in the direction of rotation and those that travel in the opposite direction. Rotation removes a degeneracy and results in a splitting of a spectral peak of order l into 2 times l plus 1 peaks. The fractional displacement in frequency for the lowest-order toroidal oscillations is 1 / 206 and of the same order as the Q of the peak, so that splitting will probably not be observed in the toroidal oscillations. Viewed locally, rotation causes a particle to precess about a direction parallel to the axis of rotation. This precession will cause a variation of amplitude with time if the motion is recorded by an instrument with an anisotropic response function. Care is therefore needed in studying the time decay of a given spectral peak. Rotation also couples the normal coordinates so that a motion that is initially purely horizontal will develop a vertical component. It is expected that vertical seismometers should record particle motion with the toroidal frequencies. The perturbations of the toroidal oscillations due to core-mantle interaction are treated in detail. An exact expression is obtained for the rate of energy dissipated by a finitely conducting plate oscillating across a magnetic field. The energy dissipated at the core-mantle boundary due to viscous and hydromagnetic coupling is shown to be insignificant as compared with the energy dissipated within the mantle. The toroidal magnetic field leaking into the lower mantle combines with the dipole field, resulting in a stress on the mantle, tending to stiffen the lower boundary. The stress is of sufficient magnitude to produce a displacement toward higher frequency in the lower-order toroidal oscillations. Observations on the (sub 0) T (sub 2) oscillations lead to an estimate of the toroidal magnetic field in the lower mantle. A calculation of elastic energy in the low-order oscillations suggests a value of 10 (sup 18) ergs per cycles per hour for the energy density at low frequencies in the Chilean earthquake. Each mode of oscillation has a characteristic radial distribution of elastic energy associated with it. This distribution determines which parts of the earth contribute most heavily in determining a particular resonant frequency. The distribution of energy for the lower 17 modes for a homogeneous and a Gutenberg model earth is calculated. The resonant frequencies for models of the earth based on the Gutenberg and Lehmann distribution of elastic properties are presented. It is shown that the Gutenberg model earth fits the observations more closely than the Lehmann model and that a slight alteration of the Gutenberg model gives a significantly better fit to the observations. The alteration involves a lower shear-wave velocity in the lower mantle while the Gutenberg velocity distribution is maintained in the upper mantle. Various studies of the earth's oscillations coupled with surface-wave investigations substantiate Gutenberg's hypothesis of a layer of low velocity in the upper mantle. The physical conditions required for the formation of a region of low velocity are examined in detail. The results confirm Birch's earlier statement that a temperature gradient in excess of 6 degrees to 7 degrees per kilometer is needed to produce a decrease in velocity. The low-velocity layer does not require that the temperature approach or exceed the melting temperature. If <b>tile</b> <b>upper</b> mantle is homogeneous, the region of lower velocity should commence {{at the base of the}} crust and extend to 150 kilometers under the oceans and about 100 kilometers under continental regions. The distribution of thermal conductivity and radioactivity consistent with the low-velocity layer is also considered...|$|R
