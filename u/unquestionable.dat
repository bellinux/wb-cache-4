5|$|In August 2004, Borland rejoined Limp Bizkit, {{which began}} {{recording}} another album, The <b>Unquestionable</b> Truth (Part 1).|$|E
5|$|Borland {{left the}} group in 2001, but Durst, Rivers, Otto and Lethal {{continued}} to record and tour with guitarist Mike Smith. Following the release of their album, Results May Vary (2003), Borland rejoined the band and recorded The <b>Unquestionable</b> Truth (Part 1) (2005) with Durst, Rivers, Lethal and drummer Sammy Siegler before entering a hiatus. In 2009, the band reunited with Borland playing guitar and began touring, culminating with the recording of the album Gold Cobra (2011), after which they left Interscope and later signed with Cash Money Records, but DJ Lethal was asked to leave the band soon after. They are currently recording their sixth studio album, Stampede of the Disco Elephants.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{was born}} in Fairview, Kentucky, to a {{moderately}} prosperous farmer, and grew up on his older brother Joseph's large cotton plantations in Mississippi and Louisiana. Joseph Davis also secured his appointment to the United States Military Academy. After graduating, Jefferson Davis served six years as a lieutenant in the United States Army. He fought in the Mexican–American War (1846–1848), as the colonel of a volunteer regiment. Before the American Civil War, he operated a large cotton plantation in Mississippi and owned as many as 74 slaves. Although he argued against secession in 1858, he believed states had an <b>unquestionable</b> right to leave the Union.|$|E
5|$|Robinson's character, {{his use of}} nonviolence, and his <b>unquestionable</b> talent {{challenged}} the traditional basis of segregation which then marked many other aspects of American life. He influenced the culture of and {{contributed significantly to the}} Civil Rights Movement. Robinson also was the first black television analyst in MLB, and the first black vice president of a major American corporation, Chock full o'Nuts. In the 1960s, he helped establish the Freedom National Bank, an African-American-owned financial institution based in Harlem, New York. After his death in 1972, in recognition of his achievements on and off the field, Robinson was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal and Presidential Medal of Freedom.|$|E
5|$|When {{the parents}} of Rufus Wooding, a young patient of Meyer's, {{suddenly}} withdraw their consent for a complicated operation, total cavo-pulmonary connection (TCPC), Meyer discovers that his SHO, Sam Kennedy (Collette Brown), has intervened and persuaded the parents not {{to go ahead with}} surgery. Believing that his authority has been undermined, Meyer promptly fires her. Kennedy threatens to go to the press if Meyer is not investigated, so the hospital Board begin an enquiry, during which Meyer is suspended. The investigation is headed by Meyer's old friend and rival, Tom Campbell-Gore (Denis Lawson). It concluded that Meyer's clinical skills were exemplary and <b>unquestionable,</b> although the Board, aware that Meyer's penchant for taking extremely difficult cases has made hospital death rates appear bad, remove Meyer's discretion to decide when to operate in such cases. This decision angers Meyer, who argues that he performs operations that are {{in the interests of the}} patients not league tables. The Board also relieve Meyer of his registrar Alex Adams (Jeremy Sheffield). Meyer resigns to work in Michigan to develop an artificial heart, while Campbell-Gore takes his post at Holby.|$|E
5|$|The first {{remarkable}} historiographical {{school of}} {{interpretation of the}} history of Argentina was founded by members of the 1837 generation, including Bartolomé Mitre. Mitre regarded the May Revolution as an iconic expression of political egalitarianism: a conflict between modern freedoms and oppression represented by the Spanish monarchy, and an attempt to establish a national organization on constitutional principles as opposed to the charismatic authority of the caudillos. These authors' views were treated as canonical {{until the end of the}} 19thcentury, when the proximity of the centennial encouraged authors to seek new perspectives. The newer authors would differ about the relative weight of the causes of the May Revolution and about whose intervention in the events was more decisive, but the main views expressed by Mitre were kept, such as to consider the revolution to be the birth of modern Argentina and an unavoidable event. These authors introduced the idea of popular intervention as another key element. By the time of the World Wars, liberal authors attempted to impose an ultimate and <b>unquestionable</b> historical perspective; Ricardo Levene and the Academia Nacional de la Historia were exponents of this tendency, which still kept most perspectives of Mitre. Left-wing authors took a revisionist view based on nationalism and anti-imperialism; they minimized the dispute between criollos and peninsulars and portrayed events as a dispute between enlightenment and absolutism. However, most of their work was focused on other historical periods.|$|E
25|$|In May 2005, The <b>Unquestionable</b> Truth (Part 1) was released. Sammy Siegler {{took over}} {{drumming}} duties {{for the band}} {{for much of the}} album. At Durst's insistence, the album was released as an underground album, without any advertising or promotion. The album sold over two million copies worldwide, peaking at number 24 on the Billboard 200. Durst later announced that despite the album's title, no sequel to The <b>Unquestionable</b> Truth would be produced. Later in the year, the band released a Greatest Hitz album.|$|E
25|$|The {{first six}} {{performances}} were sold out and, {{in spite of}} some rainouts during {{what turned out to}} be one of Santa Fe’s wettest summers, the season was an <b>unquestionable</b> success, creating both national and international attention.|$|E
25|$|Gay father : Owen {{explains}} his <b>unquestionable</b> sense of filial love, but admits {{he grew up}} {{at a time when}} homosexuality was regarded as a disease and feared his son would spurn him if he found out he was gay.|$|E
25|$|This {{belief is}} <b>unquestionable</b> for the mu as they view their works as ordained by this force. Scholars {{say that this}} belief {{is the heart of}} all {{religions}} in Korea, and it is deeply rooted {{in the mind of the}} Korean people.|$|E
25|$|Gilardi's style {{goes back}} to the Milano variety of Empire Classicism, Luigi Cagnola and in {{particular}} Antonio Antolini's Bonaparte Forum. Grigoriev later followed the same canon. Gilardi's architectural talent is disputed, but his success in construction management and ability to lead concurrent major projects is <b>unquestionable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Puckett was admired {{throughout}} his career. His <b>unquestionable</b> baseball prowess, outgoing personality and energy, charity work, community involvement, and attitude {{earned him the}} respect and admiration of fans across the country. In 1993, he received the Branch Rickey Award for his lifetime of community service work.|$|E
25|$|Maurice Ravel {{is said to}} {{have heard}} Jimmie Noone and his group perform in Chicago. Despite the imprecise anecdote, Ravel's {{involvement}} with jazz is <b>unquestionable,</b> as it influenced many of his important works, for example the fox-trot of L'enfant et les sortilèges, the blues of the Sonata for violin and piano, Concerto in G and the Concerto for the left hand, both composed for piano in 1931.|$|E
25|$|On December 28, 2007, Patarkatsishvili {{announced}} that he would withdraw his bid for presidency, but would nominally remain a candidate until January 4, 2008. On January 3, 2008, he reversed himself, however, and decided to run in presidential elections. In response, his top campaign official Giorgi Zhvania (brother of Prime Minister Zurab Zhvania) resigned, declaring that Patarkasishvili did not have the <b>unquestionable</b> reputation one would expect of a country's president.|$|E
25|$|Another {{criticism}} of postcolonial literature {{is that by}} focusing much on the distinct culture of the colonized, it seems to ignore the vast human rights violation {{that many of the}} cultural practices contain in them. Culture cannot be <b>unquestionable</b> as there are universal human rights, which should be respected, and to term everything that has emerged in the West, such as the ideals of liberty, as a negative colonial legacy, is a far-fetched proposition.|$|E
25|$|The {{award of}} Club Colours has two main functions. Firstly, the Colour {{acts as a}} reward given to senior boys who have not {{necessarily}} represented one of our first teams, been placed highly in individual sports competition or excelled {{in the areas of}} music or drama, but whose dedication and loyalty to the schools’s curriculum is <b>unquestionable.</b> Secondly, this Colour may be awarded to younger students as recognition of their success at what might be considered to be the developmental stage of their school career.|$|E
25|$|Further {{research}} by the same group showed that (R)-citalopram also enhances binding of escitalopram, and therefore the allosteric interaction cannot explain the observed counteracting effect. In the most recent paper, however, the same authors again reversed their findings and reported that (R)-citalopram decreases binding of escitalopram to the transporter. Although allosteric binding of escitalopram to the serotonin transporter is of <b>unquestionable</b> research interest, its clinical relevance is unclear since the binding of escitalopram to the allosteric site is at least 1000 times weaker than to the primary binding site.|$|E
25|$|Captain Leland Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) is {{the head}} of the Homicide Division of the San Francisco Police Department. He and Monk have been good friends since Monk was on the police force, and he {{continues}} to be Monk's friend throughout the series. He does his best to help Monk but is occasionally annoyed by Monk's phobias and the damage they can cause. In the first two seasons, Stottlemeyer is reluctant to work with Monk, seemingly annoyed by the idea that he could not handle his cases himself. By seasons three and four, his faith in Monk's contribution is well-cemented and his collaboration <b>unquestionable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Their {{friendship}} {{was also}} a working partnership; in all that Alexander undertook, Hephaestion was at his side. They worked well together; {{it is possible to}} discern a pattern, when studying Hephaestion's career, of Alexander's constant trust in, and increasing reliance on, Hephaestion. By the time of the advance into India, after the deaths of senior generals from the older generation, there had been worrying instances among senior officers of their own generation of treachery, a lack of sympathy with Alexander's aims of further integration of Persians into the army, and of sheer incompetence. Time after time, when Alexander needed to divide his forces he entrusted half to Hephaestion, knowing that in him he had a man of <b>unquestionable</b> loyalty who understood and sympathized with his aims and, above all, who got the job done.|$|E
25|$|On 2 February 1999, the Constitutional Court of Russia {{issued a}} {{temporary}} stay on any executions for a rather technical reason, but nevertheless granting the moratorium an <b>unquestionable</b> legal status {{for the first}} time. According to the Constitution as quoted above, a death sentence may be pronounced only by a jury trial, which are not yet implemented in some regions of the country. The court found that such disparity makes death sentences illegal {{in any part of}} the country, even those that do have the process of trial by jury implemented. According to the ruling, no death sentence may be passed until all regions of country have jury trials, which may happen as early as 2007, at which point the legal status of the death penalty may again become questionable.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{the legal}} system is assumed to contain some earlier law {{influenced}} by the church, and adaptation through methods of reasoning the Irish jurists would have sanctioned. There is dispute, however, as to just how large a role each of these aspects may have played in creating the legal texts. The subject is an important scope for debate. There is, however, one area where scholars have found material that is clearly old. A number of legal terms {{have been shown to}} have originated in the period before the Celtic Languages split up because they are preserved in both Old Irish and in the Welsh legal texts. On the other hand, this is not regarded as <b>unquestionable</b> evidence that the practices described by such terms are unchanged or even have their origins in the same period as do the terms.|$|E
25|$|After Rowbotham's death, Lady Elizabeth Blount (Elizabeth de Sodington Blount, née Elizabeth Anne Mould Williams) {{created the}} Universal Zetetic Society in 1893 in England {{and created a}} journal called Earth not a Globe Review, which sold for twopence, {{as well as one}} called Earth, which only lasted from 1901 to 1904. She held that the Bible was the <b>unquestionable</b> {{authority}} on the natural world and argued that one could not be a Christian and believe the Earth is a globe. Well-known members included E. W. Bullinger of the Trinitarian Bible Society, Edward Haughton, senior moderator in natural science in Trinity College, Dublin and an archbishop. She repeated Rowbotham's experiments, generating some interesting counter-experiments, but interest declined after the First World War. The movement gave rise to several books that argued for a flat, stationary earth, including Terra Firma by David Wardlaw Scott.|$|E
25|$|Catecholamines are {{synthesized}} inside {{cells and}} sequestered in intracellular vesicles. This was first shown by Blaschko and Arnold Welch (1908–2003) in Oxford and by Hillarp {{and his group}} in Lund for the adrenal medulla and later for sympathetic nerves and the brain. In addition the vesicles contained adenosine triphosphate (ATP), with a molar noradrenaline:ATP ratio in sympathetic nerve vesicles of 5.2:1 as determined by Hans-Joachim Schümann (1919–1998) and Horst Grobecker (born 1934) in Peter Holtz′ group at the Goethe University Frankfurt. Blaschko and Welch wondered how the catecholamines got out when nervous impulses reached the cells. Exocytosis was not among the possibilities they considered. It required the analogy of the ″quantal″ release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction shown by Bernard Katz, third winner of the 1970 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; the demonstration of the co-release with catecholamines of other vesicle constituents such as ATP and dopamine β-hydroxylase; and the <b>unquestionable</b> electron microscopic images of vesicles fusing with the cell membrane – to establish exocytosis.|$|E
25|$|In 1921, the bylaws of De Dageraad (article 2) stated for {{the first}} time that freethinkers, 'from the {{perspective}} of reason', placed themselves 'on an atheistic standpoint'. The Interior Minister Heemskerk (Anti-Revolutionary Party) refused to grant royal permission to this bylaws amendment in 1924, because atheism would go against morality and the public order, and lead to anarchy. After fierce debates in the House of Representatives, the Christian confessionalist majority rallied in support of the minister. De Vrijdenker freethought magazine mocked that Christianity had no monopoly on morality, and De Dageraad called for people to leave the church via the Comité Kerkafscheiding ("Committee for Apostasy"), and offered to help those who wished to terminate their membership (to which 3250 people responded in 1925). Eventually, the association decided that royal permission was important after all, and appointed special professor in philosophy of law, Leo Polak, to rewrite the bylaws. The emphasis on fighting religious dogmas and <b>unquestionable</b> authority was maintained, but the word 'atheistic' omitted; these bylaws were accepted by the government in 1927.|$|E
25|$|The Constantine and Heraclius medals {{were widely}} {{circulated}} in Italy and the Heraclius medal {{was recorded in}} an inventory of Niccolò d’Este’s treasures in 1432. Pisanello’s familiarity with both medals seems <b>unquestionable</b> because of their similarity in size and design to the medal of John VIII. Pisanello appears to have merged various elements from both medals to produce a single piece. The obverse of the Constantine medal, for example, is an equestrian portrait, {{and that of the}} Heraclius medal is a profile portrait. Like Pisanello’s medal, the obverse of the Heraclius medal shows the emperor with a servant and contains text in both Greek and Latin. Both emperors were associated with the True Cross, which is portrayed on their obverses. The ownership of the True Cross relic was something of which the Palaeologus dynasty was very proud, making these highly appropriate models for Pisanello to use. It is not known whether Pisanello believed the medals to have come from antiquity or if he was aware of their more recent French background. It is certainly plausible that he observed their similarity of style with that of French illuminated manuscripts and therefore hoped to harness, through his medal, their associations with the culture of chivalry rather than antiquity. The bold yet refined technique and style of Pisanello's medal is nevertheless clearly {{different from that of the}} more overtly intricate Constantine and Heraclius medals.|$|E
25|$|Captain (Air Corps) William T. Whisner Jr., United States Army Air Forces, {{was awarded}} the Distinguished Service Cross for {{extraordinary}} heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy while serving as Pilot of a P-51 Fighter Airplane in the 487th Fighter Squadron, 352d Fighter Group, Eighth Air Force, in aerial combat against enemy forces on 21 November 1944, during an air mission in the European Theater of Operations. On that date, Captain Whisner led a flight of P-51s on an escort mission to Merseburg, Germany. As the bombers left their target, a large formation of enemy fighters struck. In a linked series of attacks, Whisner shot down four FW-190s in the cover flight and probably got another. With {{no more than two}} FW-190s left in the cover flight he had attacked, Whisner {{turned his attention to the}} main enemy formation, exploding an FW-190 that had not dropped its belly tank. Evading three FW-190s on his tail, he shot down another that was closing on one of his pilots. Whisner was credited with five FW-190s and two probables that day. His score later was revised by the Air Force Historical Research Center to six destroyed, making that day one of the best for any USAAF pilot in the skies over Europe. Captain Whisner's <b>unquestionable</b> valor in aerial combat is in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit upon himself, the 8th Air Force, and the United States Army Air Forces.|$|E
25|$|Huxley's main co-respondents in {{the modern}} {{evolutionary}} synthesis are usually listed as Ernst Mayr, Theodosius Dobzhansky, George Gaylord Simpson, Bernhard Rensch, Ledyard Stebbins and the population geneticists J. B. S. Haldane, Ronald Fisher and Sewall Wright. However, {{at the time of}} Huxley's book several of these had yet to make their distinctive contribution. Certainly, for Huxley, E. B. Ford and his co-workers in ecological genetics were at least as important; and Cyril Darlington, the chromosome expert, was a notable source of facts and ideas.An analysis of the 'authorities cited' index of Evolution the modern synthesis shows indirectly those whom Huxley regarded as the most important contributors to the synthesis up to 1941 (the book was published in 1942, and references go up to 1941). The authorities cited 20 or more times are:Darlington, Darwin, Dobzhansky, Fisher, Ford, Goldschmidt, Haldane, J. S. Huxley, Muller, Rensch, Turrill, Wright.This list contains a few surprises. Goldschmidt was an influential geneticist who advocated evolution by saltation, and was sometimes mentioned in disagreement. Turrill provided Huxley with botanical information. The list omits three key members of the synthesis who are listed above: Mayr, Stebbins the botanist and Simpson the palaeontologist. Mayr gets 16 citations and more in the two later editions; all three published outstanding and relevant books some years later, and their contribution to the synthesis is <b>unquestionable.</b> Their lesser weight in Huxley's citations was caused by the early publication date of his book. Huxley's book is not strong in palaeontology, which illustrates perfectly why Simpson's later works were such an important contribution.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Unquestionable</b> Truth (Part 1) {{sold over}} 37,000 copies worldwide, peaking at No.24 on the Billboard 200. Following {{the release of}} the band's Greatest Hitz album, the band went on hiatus. Borland stated that it was {{unlikely}} that a sequel to The <b>Unquestionable</b> Truth would be produced and that [...] "As of right now, none of my future plans include Limp Bizkit." ...|$|E
500|$|His Irish Symphony of 1866 won {{similarly}} enthusiastic praise, but as Arthur Jacobs notes, [...] "The first rapturous {{outburst of}} enthusiasm for Sullivan as an orchestral composer did not last." [...] A comment typical {{of those that}} followed him throughout his career was that [...] "Sullivan's <b>unquestionable</b> talent should make him doubly careful not to mistake popular applause for artistic appreciation." ...|$|E
500|$|.....if {{the finding}} of Coines, Medals, Urnes, and other Monuments of famous persons, or Towns, or Utensils, be {{admitted}} for <b>unquestionable</b> Proofs, that such Persons or things have, in former times had a being, certainly those Petrifactions may {{be allowed to be}} of equal Validity and Evidence, that there have formerly been such Vegetables or Animals... and are true universal Characters legible to all rational Men.|$|E
500|$|The entire {{document}} contained Catholic undertones {{and stated}} that art must be handled carefully because it could be [...] "morally evil in its effects" [...] and because its [...] "deep moral significance" [...] was <b>unquestionable.</b> The Catholic influence on the Code was initially kept secret. [...] A recurring theme was [...] "throughout, the audience feels sure that evil is wrong and good is right." [...] The Code contained an addendum {{commonly referred to as}} the Advertising Code, which regulated film advertising copy and imagery.|$|E
500|$|In May, The <b>Unquestionable</b> Truth (Part 1) was released. Sammy Siegler {{took over}} {{drumming}} duties {{for the band}} {{for much of the}} album, which featured a more experimental sound, described by Allmusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine as [...] "neo-prog alt-metal". At Durst's insistence, the album was released as an underground album, without any advertising or promotion. Borland disagreed with the decision, suggesting that it was [...] "self-sabotage": [...] "Maybe he was already unhappy with the music, and he didn't really want to put it out there." ...|$|E
500|$|The myth of Myrrha {{is closely}} linked to that of her son, Adonis, which has been easier to trace. Adonis is the Hellenized form of the Phoenician word [...] "adoni", meaning [...] "my lord". It is {{believed}} that the cult of Adonis was known to the Greeks from around the sixth century B.C., but it is <b>unquestionable</b> that they came to know it through contact with Cyprus. Around this time, the cult of Adonis is noted in the Book of Ezekiel in Jerusalem, though under the Babylonian name Tammuz.|$|E
500|$|J.C. Maçek III of PopMatters said, [...] "What is <b>unquestionable</b> is {{that the}} Raimis and their pals created a monster in The Evil Dead. It started as a {{disastrous}} failure to obtain a big break with a too long, too perilous shoot (note Campbell's changing hairstyle in the various scenes of the one-day plot). The film went through name changes and bannings only to survive as not only 'the ultimate experience in grueling horror' but as an oft-imitated and cashed-in-on classic, with 30 years of positive reviews to prove it." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{announced}} on October 26, 2012 on Fred Durst's official Twitter account that a video {{for the first}} Cash Money single with Lil Wayne, [...] "Ready to Go" [...] was currently being filmed. Limp Bizkit also [...] "leaked" [...] a new song on the web called [...] "Lightz (City of Angels)" [...] via YouTube. The band is currently recording their seventh studio album, Stampede of the Disco Elephants with producer Ross Robinson, who also produced the band's debut album, Three Dollar Bill, Yall, and their 2005 album The <b>Unquestionable</b> Truth (Part 1). The album was scheduled for a July 2014 release.|$|E
500|$|The war in Georgia showed Russia's {{assertiveness}} in revising {{international relations}} and undermining {{the hegemony of}} the United States. Shortly after the war, Russian president Medvedev unveiled a five-point Russian foreign policy. The Medvedev Doctrine stated that [...] "protecting the lives and dignity of our citizens, wherever they may be, is an <b>unquestionable</b> priority for our country". The presence of Russian citizens in foreign countries would form a doctrinal foundation for invasion if needed. Medvedev's statement that there were areas in which Russia had [...] "privileged interests", underlined Russia's particular interest in the former Soviet Union {{and the fact that}} Russia would feel endangered by subversion of local pro-Russian regimes.|$|E
