40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe main {{objective}} of this dissertation is the detailed design, sizing, analysis and experimental validation of the sustainable wind generator. The proposed machine topology for the generator uses permanent magnets (PMs) from discarded hard disk drives (HDDs). The PM configuration inherently produces a non-uniform air gap flux-density distribution and the pole pitches of the PMs are relatively small. This would result to an <b>unbalanced</b> <b>generator</b> output {{and a number of}} stator inter-connecting leads, if conventional tooth-concentrated non-overlapping winding configurations are used. Hence, a concentrated full-pitch overlapping wave winding configuration is developed, which overcomes the aforementioned challenges. The proposed sustainable coreless axial flux generator is then analyzed with classical machine theory and verified by finite element analysis (FEA) software. It is shown that the traditional sizing approach for axial flux machines needs modification to accommodate the design of the proposed machine topology. For the numerical analysis, 3 D-FEA is used to verify the 2 Dmodel which is subsequently employed in the numerical analyses...|$|E
30|$|Assuming false {{protection}} {{operation at}} 0.2  s and the generator 35 is removed {{leading to a}} reduction of 500  MW power generation. At this time, the frequency will decline due to <b>unbalanced</b> power. <b>Generator</b> 35 (G- 35) has the highest frequency fluctuation and thus, G- 35 will discard a part of load which has to be supported by other healthy generators. After a while, the frequency fluctuation of all generators slows down and the system frequency tends to be gradually converged. The whole fluctuation process {{can be used to}} understand the redistribution of load power and the result of the process tends to make the frequency of each generator to be uniform.|$|R

The dynamic phasor approach provides more accurate models than the quasistationary ones and, at the same time, is computationally more efficient than detailed EMTP models. Two contingencies are taken as examples to study the wind turbine behavior: balanced and unbalanced voltage sags. Results are compared with standard electromechanical and electromagnetical models. Index Terms—Dynamic phasor approach, wind turbine, doubly-fed induction <b>generator,</b> <b>unbalanced</b> condition, voltage sag. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—To {{minimize}} power losses, it {{is important}} to determine the location and size of local generators to be placed in unbalanced power distribution systems. On account of some inherent features of unbalanced distribution systems, such as radial structure, large number of nodes, a wide range of X/R ratios, the conventional techniques developed for the transmission systems generally fail on the determination of optimum size and location of distributed generators (DGs). This paper presents a simple method for investigating the problem of contemporaneously choosing best location and size of DG in three-phase unbalanced radial distribution system (URDS) for power loss minimization and to improve the voltage profile of the system. Best location of the DG is determined by using voltage index analysis and size of DG is computed by variational technique algorithm according to available standard size of DGs. This paper presents the results of simulations for 25 -bus and IEEE 37 - bus Unbalanced Radial Distribution system. Keywords—Distributed <b>generator,</b> <b>unbalanced</b> radial distribution system, voltage index analysis, variational algorithm. I...|$|R
40|$|An {{isolated}} {{wind power}} generation scheme using slip ring induction machine (SRIM) is proposed. The proposed scheme maintains constant load {{voltage and frequency}} irrespective of the wind speed or load variation. The power circuit consists of two back-to-back connected inverters with a common dc link, where one inverter is directly connected to the rotor side of SRIM and the other inverter {{is connected to the}} stator side of the SRIM through LC filter. Developing a negative sequence compensation method to ensure that, even under the presence of <b>unbalanced</b> load, the <b>generator</b> experiences almost balanced three-phase current and most of the unbalanced current is directed through the stator side converter is the focus here. The SRIM controller varies the speed of the generator with variation in the wind speed to extract maximum power. The difference of the generated power and the load power is either stored in or extracted from a battery bank, which is interfaced to the common dc link through a multiphase bidirectional fly-back dc-dc converter. The SRIM control scheme, maximum power point extraction algorithm and the fly-back converter topology are incorporated from available literature. The proposed scheme is both simulated and experimentally verified...|$|R
30|$|With the {{increasing}} complexity of modern power systems, {{the incorporation of}} WAPS is necessary for power system protection. PMUs are highly preferred for this application because of the numerous benefits they provide. A novel methodology for rapid and high accuracy fault detection, classification, and location using PMUs is proposed in this paper. The presence of PMUs at all the buses provides several advantages and increases {{the accuracy of the}} fault analysis process. The algorithm can distinguish between fault event and other transient events such as overloading, <b>unbalanced</b> loading and <b>generator</b> outages. The robustness of the fault detection algorithm and the ability of the proposed methodology for fault analysis to be extended to other systems are some of its key advantages. The proposed algorithms are validated by extensive simulation studies involving a variety of faults at different distances, fault impedances and fault inception angles on two test systems, a three-bus power system and the WSCC nine-bus power system. From the studies performed, the results indicate that a fault occurring anywhere in the system can be correctly detected, classified and located. The fault detection algorithm can detect the presence of a fault within one power cycle. The speed of operation of the proposed algorithm facilitates faster restoration of faulty branches, hence reducing the power outage time and enhancing the reliability of the power system.|$|R
40|$|The {{penetration}} of micro-grid system containing renewable energy generation is increasing exponentially for alleviating the energy source crisis and environmental pollution. Micro-grids {{are expected to}} achieve two priority aims, which are increase in stability and improvement of renewable energy generation efficiency. In terms of the first aim, micro-grid needs to keep operating with or without main-grid connecting. In grid disconnected condition, which is also called islanded condition, micro-grid system has to ensure its reliability and energy quality, to balance power between generators and loads. For the second aim, micro-grid with renewable energy sources is expected to extract maximum available energy at any moment. For realizing this aim, the energy storage system should be embedded in a micro-grid to help sharing the surplus energy from generators or missing energy required by loads. Based on above two aims, this thesis presents a comprehensive modeling of a micro-grid with the functions of islanding detection, autonomous operation, synchronization and re-synchronization and energy storage. Topology of local distribution generation is modeled by a grid-tied inverter with LCL filter. Proportional resonant controller is applied to control the inverter. A new islanding detection method which {{is a combination of}} two passive detection methods has been adopted in this research. A new method for autonomous operation of islanded micro-grid which combines weak droop control and PQ control has been used in this research. An effective and fast 50 Hz-signal extracting filter, Windowed-sinc band-pass filter has been used for synchronizing and re-synchronizing between micro-grid and main grid. A combination of bi-directional buck/boost converter and DC/AC converter is applied to connect the energy storage block with micro-grid to fulfill the discharging/charging function. A full code-based implementation of this micro-grid modeling has been conducted in Matlab Simulink environment. The simulation results have verified that this new micro-grid model could operate well. Specifically, firstly, by combining two passive islanding detection methods, one can reach error-free islanding detection and protection. Secondly, autonomous operation of micro-grid containing three DGs could be realized by employing weak droop control and PQ control. The weak droop control could share the <b>unbalanced</b> energy between <b>generators</b> and loads automatically. Thirdly, smooth synchronization and re-synchronization could be obtained by extracting fundamental signal of each inverter output by the Windowed-sinc band-pass filter. Lastly, a battery energy system has been adopted to inject or absorb energy into or from micro-grid...|$|R
