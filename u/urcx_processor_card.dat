5000|$|Hermes {{feels that}} he needs to perform the last upgrade, by {{replacing}} his organic brain with a mechanical one. When Yuri does not want to do the brain replacement, Hermes, Professor Farnsworth, and Bender head to the robot graveyard to exhume a robot body for a <b>processor</b> <b>card.</b> Unbeknownst to them, the <b>processor</b> <b>card</b> belonged to Roberto. In order for the procedure to work, Hermes locks LaBarbara, Dwight, and the Planet Express crew in the lab until Professor Farnsworth completes the transplant. LaBarbara and Hermes' friends convince Professor Farnsworth to stop this. Unfortunately Hermes still wants to continue with the implant. With the professor's refusal, Zoidberg agrees to complete the operation using Hermes' human body to help him, while singing [...] "he wants a robot brain." [...] After the removal of the brain and placing it in Little Hermes, Hermes comes back to life in his original body and realizes that he has given up his humanity for the pointless pursuit of perfectionism. The crew later learns that after the transplant the <b>processor</b> <b>card</b> was that of Roberto (whose <b>processor</b> <b>card</b> was installed into the Hermes robot) as Roberto reshapes his head. Still wanting to eat Hermes' skin, Roberto used the new robot body to remove a piece of Hermes' skin off his forearm, but realizes too late he cannot eat it because of LaBarbara's curried goat she cooked over the many years. Roberto's new body then starts to melt quickly, thus saving the crew. Hermes ends up thanking Dr. Zoidberg for his part of restoring him.|$|R

50|$|Throughout its lifecycle, the GTD-5 EAX {{incorporated}} a quad-redundant processor architecture. The main processor complex of the APC, TPC, TCU, RLU, and RSU all {{consisted of a}} pair of <b>processor</b> <b>cards,</b> and each of those <b>processor</b> <b>cards</b> contained a pair of processors. The on-card pair of processors executed precisely the same sequence of instructions, and the output of the pair were compared each clock cycle. If the results were not identical, the processors were immediately reset, and the pair of processors on the other card were brought online as the active processor complex. The active processor always kept memory up-to-date so that when these forced switches occurred, little data loss was suffered. When the switch was requested as a part of routine maintenance, the switch could be accomplished with no data loss at all.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{details the}} {{experiments}} {{carried out with}} the EPSILON <b>processor</b> <b>card,</b> configured as a MultiLayer Perceptron, and networks optimised for fault tolerance performance using the weight-noise training technique.

The results show that while there is the potential for obtaining such fault tolerant weights sets, robust noise-trained networks require an increased dynamic weight range. This case study with the EPSILON <b>processor</b> <b>card</b> highlights what we believe to be a number of common inadequacies with custom designed hardware.
