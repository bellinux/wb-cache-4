50|$|An {{adjustable}} two-piece {{design is}} credited to Myles Stanfield, {{a native of}} Truro, Nova Scotia, who patented his design on 7 December 1915. In 1898, Myles and his brother John had developed a product called Stanfield's <b>Unshrinkable</b> Underwear for Stanfield's, their garment manufacturing company.|$|E

They renamed the Truro factory Truro Knitting Mills Limited {{and concentrated on}} knitted merchandise. Their company was innovative and sold many products {{in the form of}} shrink-proof heavy woolen underwear that were used by workers during the Klondike Gold Rush in the late 1890s. In 1898, they developed Stanfield's <b>Unshrinkable</b> Underwear and in 1915 they introduced an adjustable two-piece design patented on 7 December 1915.

5000|$|Viyella {{was a soft}} dress-weight {{fabric that}} was more {{resistant}} to shrinkage than any comparable pure wool alternative (challis, for example). In its early years it was marketed as a fabric which combined lightness and fashion with warmth and durability. One 1920s advertisement called it a [...] "guaranteed <b>unshrinkable</b> fine wool flannel" [...] for women who wanted both [...] "daintiness" [...] and [...] "protectiveness". By the early 20th century it came in various weights and widths, some rather narrow by today's standards, and in both plain colours and woven or printed patterns, and was exported from the United Kingdom to other English-speaking countries. Towards {{the end of the}} 20th century it was woven in 150cm wide lengths suitable for modern garment design and production.|$|E
50|$|But now {{consider}} two a-cycles. Since the Klein bottle is nonorientable, you can transport {{one of them}} all the way round the bottle (along the b-cycle), and it will come back as &minus;a. This is because the Klein bottle is made from a cylinder, whose a-cycle ends are glued together with opposite orientations. Hence 2a = a + a = a + (&minus;a) = 0. This phenomenon is called torsion. Similarly, in the projective plane, following the <b>unshrinkable</b> cycle b round twice remarkably creates a trivial cycle which can be shrunk to a point; that is, b + b = 0. Because b must be followed around twice to achieve a zero cycle, the surface is said to have a torsion coefficient of 2. However, following a b-cycle around twice in the Klein bottle gives simply b + b = 2b, since this cycle lives in a torsion-free homology class. This corresponds to {{the fact that in the}} fundamental polygon of the Klein bottle, only one pair of sides is glued with a twist, whereas in the projective plane both sides are twisted.|$|E
5000|$|Pussyfoot has {{appeared}} in some Warner Bros. merchandising, and the pair have been featured in various Warner Bros. productions, such as the third segment of the 1983 Twilight Zone movie, and a 1999 Looney Tunes comic book story called [...] "Bringing Up Baby". Tiny Toon Adventures featured a similar character named Barky Marky who was a comparatively minor character on the show. The pair were also an inspiration for the Buttons and Mindy characters that were featured in the successor to Tiny Toons, Animaniacs. Interestingly enough, in the Buttons and Mindy short Cat on a Hot Steel Beam, the cat that Mindy follows throughout the cartoon {{is none other than}} Pussyfoot. Pussyfoot makes a cameo appearance in Chuck Jones' 1995 short Another Froggy Evening. Jones would later revisit the gimmick of a cute kitten with an unlikely protector in a MGM Tom and Jerry short, The <b>Unshrinkable</b> Jerry Mouse, with Jerry becoming a kitten's friend and protector against a selfish and jealous Tom (the plot of which was borrowed from Feline Frame-Up).|$|E
40|$|Controlled {{low-strength}} material (CLSM) is a self-compacted, {{cementitious material}} used {{primarily as a}} backfill in lieu of compacted fill. Many terms are currently used to describe this material including flowable fill, <b>unshrinkable</b> fill, controlled density fill, flowable mortar, flowable fly ash, fly ash slurry, plastic soil-cement, soil-cement slurry, K-Krete and other various names. This report contains information on applications, material properties, mix proportioning, construction and quality-control procedures. This report`s intent is to provide basic information on CLSM technology, with emphasis on CLSM material characteristics and advantages over conventional compacted fill. Applications include backfills, structural fills, insulating and isolation fills, pavement bases, conduit bedding, erosion control, void filling, and radioactive waste management...|$|E

Principle possibility of obtaining <b>unshrinkable</b> concretes with the formation of ettringite using aluminate cement, gypsum and modern superplasticizers. Studies of free shrinkage of mixed binder showed that binder can be attribute to binders with compensated shrinkage.

40|$|Comparative {{studies have}} been made of three types of {{treatments}} which utilize diisocy-anates for stabilization of wool yarns and fabrics, {{and it has been}} shown that the procedures which utilize the technique of interfacial polymerization as developed by Whitfield et al. is most effective. The procedures of interfacial formation of polyurea upon fiber surface were studied in detail, and it was found that the employment of ethylene diamine, which had not hitherto been used as a diamine component, resulted in the best shrinkproof effect. The electron microscopic study revealed that the fibers treated by this procedure were masked uniformly by the polyurea resin. The conditions of treatment were varied, and the influence of these conditions upon the uptake and shrinkproof effect was studied. The uptake of from 2 to 5 % was sufficient to make the yarns and fabrics practically <b>unshrinkable.</b> The mechanical properties and the moisture regain of the fibers were not significantly affected by the treatment. The anti-scale coefficient of friction decreased by the treatment, and therefore the directional frictional effect decreased. This would be the main factor of producing the shrinkproof effect...|$|E
40|$|Conceptual {{developments}} are underpinned by the intellectual process of constant reviewing and developing innovative research ideas into realistic design. There exists no one quick fix, {{fit for purpose}} solution to ensure stability of structures being constructed {{on a wide range}} of demanding ground conditions and variety of project constraints. Routine highway design and construction technology conformingly adopt only conventional fill methods and thus fail even to address adequately the less favoured conditions in challenging situations: a high initial construction cost arising from a full replacement of existing unfavourable soil conditions or an unsustainable construction design leading to a condition of rapid disintegration requiring regular expensive and disruptive highway maintenance activity. Undulating road embankment surfaces result from the transference of heavy self-weight of the embankment fill on yielding and non-uniform subgrade such as in peat soils. The Manitoba Water Services Board [1] specifies four classes of fills (viz; common, compacted common, compacted select granular backfill and <b>unshrinkable</b> backfill) for backfilling of pipeline trenches. Both conventional and alternatively sustainable backfills are discussed in this paper with new and appropriate technology opening doors with other tangible benefits for innovative and cost saving outcomes for differing construction scenarios...|$|E
40|$|A {{geometric}} fullerene, {{or simply}} a fullerene, is {{the surface of a}} simple closed convex 3 -dimensional polyhedron with only 5 - and 6 -gonal faces. Fullerenes are geometric models for chemical fullerenes, which form an important class of organic molecules. These molecules have been stud-ied intensively in chemistry, physics, crystallography, and so on, and their study has led to the appearance of a vast literature on fullerenes in math-ematical chemistry and combinatorial and applied geometry. In particu-lar, several generalizations of the notion of a fullerene have been given, aiming at various applications. Here a new generalization of this notion is proposed: an n-disk-fullerene. It is obtained from the surface of a closed convex 3 -dimensional polyhedron which has one n-gonal face and all other faces 5 - and 6 -gonal, by removing the n-gonal face. Only 5 - and 6 -disk-fullerenes correspond to geometric fullerenes. The notion of a geo-metric fullerene is therefore generalized from spheres to compact simply connected two-dimensional manifolds with boundary. A two-dimensional surface is said to be <b>unshrinkable</b> if it does not contain belts, that is, simple cycles consisting of 6 -gons each of which has two neighbours adjacent at a pair of opposite edges. Shrinkability of fullerenes and n-disk-fullerenes is investigated...|$|E
30|$|The American Concrete Institute (ACI) {{defines a}} CLSM as a self-leveling, self-compacting, and {{cementitious}} material primarily used to replace conventional backfill soil and structural fillings {{that result in}} unconfined compressive strengths of 1200  psi (8.3  MPa) or less [2]. CLSM {{should not be considered}} as a type of low-strength concrete, but rather as a structural backfill. CLSM is known by many different names such as flowable fill, controlled density fill, <b>unshrinkable</b> fill, flowable mortar, soil–cement slurry, and plastic soil–cement. There are various inherent advantages of using CLSM instead of compacted fill in these applications. These benefits include reduced labor and equipment costs (due to self-leveling properties and no need for compaction), faster construction, and the ability to place material in confined spaces [2]. If future excavation is anticipated, the maximum long-term compressive strength should generally be less than 2.1  MPa (i.e., general fill) [2]. It is advantageous due to the relatively low strength itself of CLSM. Another advantage of CLSM is that it possibly contains by-product materials, thereby reducing the demand on landfills, where these materials may otherwise be deposited and contributing towards the sustainable development [32]. In general, CLSM mixtures consist of standard materials such as Portland cement, fly ash, fine aggregate and water. However, other industrial by-products and recycled materials are also accepted and encouraged {{as long as they are}} considered to be available, cost-effective for specific application and the necessary characteristics of the mixture such as flowability, strength, excavatability, and density are acceptable [2].|$|E

The above fault is due to the swelling property of fibre, the strong twist of yarn and, especially, to the influence stretching at the tentering finish. So, we expected to obtain a method of improvement by decreasing the swelling property of fibre while stretching at the tentering finish and by settling the crepe effect. And, in this experiment, by the treatments of formaldehyde and urea-formaldehyde resine, we tried to find some finishing method to make silk crepe and silk-rayon union crepe <b>unshrinkable.</b> Thus we obtained the following result as we expected;(1) The formaldehyde treatment is suitable for silk crepe but not applicable to rayon crepe and rayon-silk union crepe for the reason that it decreases the tensile strength of rayon and its affinity for dyestuff. By this treatment, the initial shrinkage of silk crepe, i. e., 10 % for warp, 7 % for weft, was reduced to 2 %. (2) The urea-formaldehyde resine finish is suitable for rayon crepe and rayon-silk union crepe.
