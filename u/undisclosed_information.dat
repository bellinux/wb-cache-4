40|$|Gas turbine {{off design}} {{performance}} prediction is strictly {{dependent on the}} accuracy of compressor and turbine map characteristics. Experimental data regarding component maps {{are very difficult to}} find in literature, since it is <b>undisclosed</b> proprietary <b>information</b> of the engine manufacturers. To overcome this limitation, gas turbine engineers use available generic component maps and modify them to reach the maximum adherence with the experimental measures. Different scaling and adaptation techniques have been employed to this aim; these methodologies are usually based upon analytic regression models which minimize the deviation from experimental data. However, since these models are built mainly for a specific compressor or turbine map, their generalization is quite difficult: in fact, regression is highly shape-dependent and therefore requires a different model for each different specific component. This paper proposes {{a solution to the problem}} stated above: a new method for map adaptation is investigated to improve steady-state off design prediction accuracy of a generic gas turbine component. The methodology does not employ analytical regression models; its main principle relies in performing map modifications in an appropriate neighborhood of the multiple experimental points used for the adaptation. When using gas turbine simulation codes, component maps are usually stored in a data matrix and are ordered in a format suitable for 2 -D interpolation. A perturbation of the values contained in the matrix results in component map morphing. An optimization algorithm varies the perturbation intensity vector in order to minimize the deviation between experimental and predicted points. The adaptation method is integrated inside TSHAFT, the gas turbine prediction code developed at the University of Padova. The assessment of this methodology will be exposed by illustrating a case study carried out upon a turbojet engine...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, {{information}} has not generally been regarded by {{the common law}} as being property and able to be legally protected {{in the same way}} as land, money or goods. Australian courts have demonstrated great reluctance to change this approach, even though information is increasingly considered to be a valuable asset, particularly by the business community. However, a change in the way information is regarded has taken place over the last four to five decades, resulting primarily from the increased use of computer technology. In Australian law, organisations or individuals who wish to restrict access to their business information and keep it confidential currently have limited legal means to achieve their aim. The breach of confidence action, contract law, copyright law and criminal law may all be used to protect information from unauthorised access or use but only to a certain extent. In most instances these traditional legal approaches require that there is a confidential or contractual relationship between the parties, that the information be in an original form, or that the unauthorised access be made using computer technology. There are particular deficiencies in the legal protection available when <b>undisclosed</b> business <b>information</b> is accessed by a party outside a contractual or confidential relationship, often through improper means. Ways in which these deficiencies, particularly in respect to the breach of confidence action, could be overcome have been proposed by a number of law reform bodies, in Australia and overseas. However, no legislative amendments adopting these proposals have been introduced in Australia and judicial decisions indicate that the courts are likely to continue a conservative approach to the protection of information to avoid creation of barriers to the free flow of information. Different legal approaches to the protection of business information have developed in continental Europe and America. However a review shows that deficiencies in the protection offered have not been fully overcome in these jurisdictions. More recently, a number of international developments have taken place which are of significance to the protection of business information. The developments take different forms, either as binding international agreements, or non-binding agreements. Examples are the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Agreement (TRIPS); the OECD Guidelines of Security for Information Systems and for Cryptography Policy; and the WIPO Model Provisions for Unfair Competition. These agreements establish new international standards relating to the protection of business information. The way in which these international agreements may become part of Australian domestic law and policy can be predicted and explained by analysing the nature and form of the relevant international agreements and the process by which they may become part of domestic law; by having regard to recent developments in this field in other countries; by analysing Australia's response to similar developments in the past, for example, the OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder flows of Personal Data; and by reviewing Australia's response so far to the latest developments relating to the protection of confidential business information.

40|$|Collagen VI {{is a major}} protein of the {{extracellular}} matrix with a broad distribution in many tissues, including skeletal muscle and connective tissues. It is composed of three distinct alpha chains, α 1, α 2 and α 3 (VI), ecoded by separate genes. Mutations of collagen VI genes in humans cause several muscle diseases, such as Bethlem myopathy and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy. Collagen VI null (Col 6 a 1 –/–) mice display a myopathic phenotype characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, spontaneous apoptosis and autophagic impairments in myofibers. These findings indicate that collagen VI has a key role for skeletal muscle homeostasis. Before starting my PhD, I participated to a project aimed at investigating the effects of physical exercise on wild type and Col 6 a 1 –/– skeletal muscle. This work demonstrated {{for the first time}} that exercise is able to activate the autophagic response in muscle. Moreover, this study revealed that physical exercise it is detrimental for Col 6 a 1 –/– muscles. I decided to focus my main PhD work on investigating the role of collagen VI in fibroblasts, which are the major cell type responsible for the secretion and extracellular deposition of this protein, and elucidating the consequences on fibroblasts due to ablation of collagen VI. In patients affected by Bethlem myopathy and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy, the mutated forms of collagen VI are produced and retained by fibroblasts, suggesting a potential contribution for this cell type in the onset and progression of muscle defects. To assess how lack of collagen VI impacts on fibroblast functions, I generated stable mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) lines from wild type and Col 6 a 1 –/– mice and showed that collagen VI is necessary for autophagy regulation and has prosurvival properties in fibroblasts. Col 6 a 1 –/– MEFs displayed accumulation of LC 3 both basally and following autophagy induction. To dissect the autophagic response of these cells, I studied the autophagy flux and the activity of the nutrient sensor kinase mTOR. I found that in Col 6 a 1 –/– MEFs the mTORC 1 downstream targets, such as 4 E-BP 1 and S 6, are persistently activated under nutrient depletion stimuli, leading to autophagy inhibition in starving cells. Furthermore, Col 6 a 1 –/– MEFs presented a general energy imbalance, leading to over-activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase. These signalling defects lead to massive accumulation of autophagosomes inside Col 6 a 1 –/– fibroblasts, due to a compromised autophagosome-lysosome fusion in association with the presence of enlarged lysosomes and LAMP- 2 protein depletion. These lysosomal defects are also associated with aberrant localization and activity of TFEB, a master transcription factor for lysosome biogenesis and autophagy regulation. In addition, Col 6 a 1 –/– MEFs showed increased susceptibility to cell death, especially under nutrient stress, that ended with activation of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. This phenotype was specifically rescued by culturing cells onto purified collagen VI provided as an adhesive substrate. Lack of collagen VI also influenced the organization of the mitochondrial network, which has a key role in cell survival. Mitochondria of Col 6 a 1 –/– MEFs exhibited increased fragmented morphology, associated with Parkin translocation and defective mitophagy. These findings show that fibroblasts play a relevant role in the development of the pathophysiological defects of collagen VI null mice, a finding that provide a thus far <b>undisclosed</b> and valuable <b>information</b> for the diagnosis and therapy of inherited diseases associated with collagen VI gene mutations. Moreover, they reveal for the first time a direct effect of collagen VI on the regulation of autophagy and associated mechanisms in this cell type...|$|R

40|$|I {{examine the}} {{implications}} of nondisclosure in a setting {{where there is a}} credible signal as to the proprietary nature of the <b>undisclosed</b> <b>information.</b> Specifically, I investigate the market and analysts' response to firms’ application to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a confidential treatment order (CTO), which allows firms to redact required disclosures from SEC filings when the redacted information is proprietary. I find that the market and analysts react favorably to the voluntary nondisclosure of proprietary information using the SEC confidential treatment process. Market and analysts reactions are more favorable to the redaction of information that is more likely to have proprietary value, such as information related to research and development. In addition, I show that the redacting firms experience superior accounting performance compared to their peers in the years following the redaction, consistent with the market and analysts’ response to the redaction. However, I find that analysts engage in more intense private information search in response to a CTO redaction. This finding suggests that, although a CTO redaction can signal the nature of <b>undisclosed</b> <b>information,</b> analysts believe that the signal is not fully revealing of the economic magnitude of the <b>undisclosed</b> <b>information.</b> Overall, this study’s findings indicate that a firm's willingness to submit to the CTO approval process serves as a credible signal of the proprietary nature of the withheld information.

40|$|We have {{experienced}} a growing importance of intellectual capital and intangible assets and an increased tendency for firms and public institutions to privatize, {{by the use of}} patents or copyrights, their knowledge assets and creative expressions. Because control over the use of an intellectual property right (IPR) requires ownership or a licence, the growing importance of knowledge-based assets and creative expressions has been accompanied by recognition that patents and copyrights represent strategic assets for those who own and control them. It is therefore not surprising that, in recent years, the pace at which individuals, firms and the public sector are using IPRs to privatize knowledge-based assets and creative expressions has been accelerating. This trend has been enhanced by the view of many industry, government and international agencies that the privatization of the intellectual capital and knowledge-based assets of individuals and firms provides many advantages (for example, competitive advantage), and we have seen an increased enforcement of IPR regimes worldwide.
