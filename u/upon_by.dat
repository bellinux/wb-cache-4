5|$|Aquatic {{invertebrates}} {{have been}} recognized {{as an integral part}} of the river otter's diet. Otters consume more aquatic insects in the summer as the populations increase and specific life stages heighten their susceptibility. Most aquatic invertebrates preyed <b>upon</b> <b>by</b> the otters are from the families Odonata (dragonfly nymphs), Plecoptera (stonefly nymphs), and Coleoptera (adult beetles). Invertebrates discovered within scats or digestive tracts could most likely be a secondary food item, first being consumed by the fish that are subsequently preyed <b>upon</b> <b>by</b> the otters.|$|E

If it gathers at least three-fifths of both the Senate and the General Assembly, the amendment is to be submitted to be voted <b>upon</b> <b>by</b> the people of New Jersey. If a majority votes for the amendment, the amendment is passed on the thirtieth day after the vote.|$|E

5|$|A typhus {{epidemic}} swept Montreal in late 1847 and Montreal's religious communities, including Cadron-Jetté and {{the staff}} of the hospice, were called <b>upon</b> <b>by</b> Bishop Bourget to assist in combating it. The hospice's chaplain and director, Antoine Rey, and its midwife, Madame Montrait, were among the nine priests and 13 Religious Sisters of Montreal who were killed by the disease. One of the hospice's penitents also died due to the disease. Bishop Bourget subsequently named Father Venant Pilon as Rey's replacement as Director of the Hospice.|$|E

In 2014, {{he was asked}} to refrain from playing blackjack at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas, after a series of wins aroused suspicion that he was counting cards, which is a legal gambling strategy frowned <b>upon</b> <b>by</b> casinos.

5|$|Alternatively, Pachycephalosaurus {{and other}} pachycephalosaurid genera may {{have engaged in}} flank-butting during {{intraspecific}} combat. In this scenario, an individual may have stood roughly parallel or faced a rival directly, using intimidation displays to cow its rival. If intimidation failed, the Pachycephalosaurus would bend its head downward and to the side, striking the rival pachycephalosaur on its flank. This hypothesis {{is supported by the}} relatively broad torso of most pachycephalosaurs, which would have protected vital organs from trauma. The flank-butting theory was first proposed by Sues in 1978, and expanded <b>upon</b> <b>by</b> Ken Carpenter in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Although the willie wagtail is an {{aggressive}} defender of its nest, predators do account for many eggs and young. About {{two thirds of}} eggs hatch successfully, and a third leave the nest as fledglings. Nestlings may be preyed <b>upon</b> <b>by</b> both pied butcherbirds, (Cracticus nigrogularis) black butcherbirds (C. quoyi), the spangled drongo (Dicrurus bracteatus), and the pied currawong (Strepera graculina), {{as well as the}} feral cat (Felis catus), and rat species. The proximity of nesting to human habitation has also left nests open to destruction by children.|$|E

After the departure of Grant and Breyfogle from DC Comics, Anarky's characterization fell to various authors who utilized him thereafter.|$|E
