30|$|Using {{intermodal}} {{transportation is}} vital for the delivery of relief supplies when single mode alternative becomes <b>unusable</b> <b>or</b> infeasible. The objective {{of this paper is}} to investigate the use of intermodal freight transportation in humanitarian logistics.|$|R
50|$|If {{the company}} ceases {{to support a}} {{specific}} product (or declares bankruptcy), its purchased product may become <b>unusable</b> <b>or</b> incapable of being (re)installed unless an activation-free copy or final patch that removes or bypasses activation is released.|$|R
50|$|NASA {{declared}} all engineering {{goals of}} the flight as achieved, despite occasional issues with telemetry during flight and some measurement data being <b>unusable</b> <b>or</b> only partially usable. Project Highwater on SA-3 was also declared successful, though again, telemetry issues produced questionable results.|$|R
5000|$|Historically, MouseKeys {{supported}} GUI programs {{when many}} terminals had no dedicated pointing device. As pointing devices became ubiquitous, {{the use of}} mouse keys narrowed to situations where a pointing device was missing, <b>unusable,</b> <b>or</b> inconvenient. Such situations may arise from the following: ...|$|R

Any firearm deemed <b>unusable</b> <b>or</b> obsolete is destroyed on the premises, the materials are reduced to unusable pieces and then sold for scrap to be melted down.|$|R

50|$|During {{this period}} the down line (from London) {{was used by}} goods trains whilst the up line was used for wagon storage. The line was used for diversionary {{purposes}} {{on a number of}} occasions, especially during the Second World War, when enemy action made the main line <b>unusable</b> <b>or</b> when the main line was flooded by the River Lea.|$|R
50|$|Retrenchment is a {{technique}} associated with Formal Methods that was introduced {{to address some of}} the perceived limitations of formal, model based refinement, for situations in which refinement might be regarded as desirable in principle, but turned out to be <b>unusable,</b> <b>or</b> nearly <b>unusable,</b> in practice. It was primarily developed at the School of Computer Science, University of Manchester.|$|R
50|$|Some of FidoNet's echomail {{conferences}} {{are available}} via gateways with the Usenet news hierarchy using software like UFGate. There are also mail gates for exchanging messages between Internet and FidoNet. Widespread net abuse and e-mail spam on the Internet side has caused some gateways (such {{as the former}} 1:1/31 IEEE fidonet.org gateway) to become <b>unusable</b> <b>or</b> cease operation entirely.|$|R
50|$|One {{major issue}} with lever-actions (and {{to a lesser}} extent pump-actions) was that early shotgun shells were often made of paper or similar fragile {{materials}} (modern hulls are plastic or metal). As a result, the loading of shells, or working of the action of the shotgun, could often result in cartridges getting crushed and becoming <b>unusable,</b> <b>or</b> even damaging the gun.|$|R
25|$|Physical {{damage to}} the housing or {{components:}} Damage such as cracked housings, torn or dislodged mouthpieces, damaged exhaust fairings, can cause gas flow problems <b>or</b> <b>leaks,</b> <b>or</b> can make the regulator uncomfortable to use or difficult to breathe from.|$|R

The auditors found that [...] "TSA stored <b>unusable</b> <b>or</b> obsolete equipment, maintained inappropriate safety stock levels, and did not develop an inventory management process that systematically deploys equipment." ...|$|R
500|$|No {{noticeable}} performance penalty over native FreeBSD {{programs has}} been noted when running Linux binaries, and, in some cases, these may even perform more smoothly than on Linux. However, the layer is not altogether seamless, and some Linux binaries are <b>unusable</b> <b>or</b> only partially usable on FreeBSD. There is support for system calls up to version 2.6.18, available since [...] As of release 10.3, FreeBSD can run 64-bit Linux binaries.|$|R
50|$|The {{altitude}} of this woreda ranges from 880 to 2,400 meters above sea level. Rivers within the woreda include the Nedi, Finchawa, Agemsa, Korke, Gogoldas, Boyi and Bedessa Rivers. A {{survey of the}} land in this woreda shows that 11.4% is arable or cultivable, 2.2% pasture, 1.4% forest, and the remaining 83.8% is considered mountainous, <b>unusable,</b> <b>or</b> part of the Finicha'a Sugar Project. Niger seed is an important local cash crop.|$|R

However, the layer is not altogether seamless, and some Linux binaries are <b>unusable</b> <b>or</b> only partially usable on FreeBSD.

50|$|The {{majority}} of this woreda (95%) consists of undulating plains, with hills, valleys and mountains covering the rest. Rivers include the Genale, Logeta, Webe, Meganamo and Areba. A {{survey of the}} land in this woreda shows that 19.5% is arable or cultivable (51% of which was under annual crops), 70% pasture, 7.3% forest, and the remaining 3.2% is considered <b>unusable</b> <b>or</b> other. Ensete is an important food source.|$|R

30|$|For certain post-mining {{land uses}} such as airports, {{shopping}} centers, and industrial parks, compaction of surface materials is necessary. Support {{features such as}} runways, roadways, and parking areas require that both subsurface and surface materials be compacted. Compaction of fill materials can prevent excessive downward movements of the land surface due to subsidence and settlement. Excessive downward movement of land surfaces supporting structures will distort structures, rendering them <b>unusable</b> <b>or</b> requiring expensive repair.|$|R
25|$|Malibu's dry {{brush and}} steep clay slopes make it prone to fires, floods, and mudslides. Poor grading {{practices}} and over-irrigation <b>or</b> <b>leaking</b> pipes exacerbate {{the tendency for}} landslides.|$|R
50|$|A few {{up-to-date}} {{reconnaissance satellite}} images have been declassified on occasion, <b>or</b> <b>leaked,</b> {{as in the}} case of KH-11 photographs which were sent to Jane's Defence Weekly in 1984.|$|R
50|$|After the {{successful}} execution of Operation Overlord, the Normandy landings, attention {{shifted to the}} south. Most ports in the north were <b>unusable,</b> <b>or</b> too heavily fortified (e.g. Cherbourg, Brest, Lorient, Saint Nazaire), which made seizure {{and control of the}} French ports at Marseille and Toulon increasingly attractive. The French leaders pressed for an invasion in southern France, too. Finally, after many delays, on 14 July 1944, Operation Dragoon was authorized by the Allied Combined Chiefs of Staff.|$|R
40|$|Data-entry device held in {{one hand}} and {{operated}} with five fingers. Contains seven keys. Letters, numbers, punctuation, and cursor commands keyed into computer by pressing keys in various combinations. Device called "data egg" used where standard typewriter keyboard <b>unusable</b> <b>or</b> unavailable. Contains micro-processor and 32 -Kbyte memory. Captures text and transmits it to computer. Concept extended to computer mouse. Especially useful to handicapped or bedridden people who find it difficult or impossible to operate standard keyboards...|$|R
5000|$|New {{business}} models {{for use of}} software (services) over Internet may be boosted by the technology. By strengthening the DRM system, one could base a business model on renting programs for a specific time periods or [...] "pay as you go" [...] models. For instance, one could download a music file which could only be played {{a certain number of}} times before it becomes <b>unusable,</b> <b>or</b> the music file could be used only within a certain time period.|$|R

50|$|The holds: on timber ships the holds {{were not}} {{sufficiently}} water, oil or air-tight {{to prevent a}} liquid cargo from spoiling <b>or</b> <b>leaking.</b> The development of iron and steel hulls solved this problem.|$|R
50|$|Although air and {{sunlight}} are available everywhere on Earth, crops also depend on soil nutrients {{and the availability}} of water. Monoculture is a method of growing only one crop at a time in a given field, which can damage land and cause it to become either <b>unusable</b> <b>or</b> suffer from reduced yields. Monoculture can also cause the build-up of pathogens and pests that target one specific species. The Great Irish Famine (1845-1849) is a well-known example of the dangers of monoculture.|$|R
50|$|It {{appears the}} project was leaked ahead of time as the BBC never officially {{announced}} the Project and the website was soon taken down in 2012. No further announcements (<b>or</b> <b>leaks)</b> have been made.|$|R
