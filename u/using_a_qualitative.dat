5000|$|The Authentic Leadership Questionnaire (ALQ) is {{a survey}} {{completed}} by followers {{to capture the}} level of authentic leadership behaviors exhibited by supervisors. A self-assessment version is also available. The measure, developed specifically with the emerging authentic leadership theory in mind, includes sixteen items grouped into four major subcategories: self-awareness, relational transparency, internalized moral perspective, and balanced processing.Most academic research since {{the development of the}} ALQ has used it to measure levels of authentic leadership. [...] However, the ALQ has been criticized for <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>qualitative</b> (and therefore subjective) approach to validation rather than a quantitative approach. Additionally, the ALQ is a commercially copyrighted measure (only sample measures are freely available), potentially limiting its availability to scientists and practitioners.|$|E

We utilise a general method for extracting information from an encoded string of symbols as a canonical representation of architectural plans. The information content of each drawing or set of drawings is determined by measuring its entropy. We present two classes of qualitative representation of shape and space. The first <b>uses</b> <b>a</b> <b>qualitative</b> representation of the outline of shapes in the drawing. The second <b>uses</b> <b>a</b> <b>qualitative</b> representation of the spaces described in the drawing.

50|$|In {{addition}} to {{qualitative and quantitative}} research methodologies, {{there is also a}} third research approach called mixed methods. “Mixed methods is a type of procedural approach for conducting research that involves collecting, analyzing, and mixing quantitative and qualitative data within a single program of study. Its rationale postulates that the use of both qualitative and quantitative research provides a better and richer understanding of a research problem than either traditional research approach alone provides.” Complex contextual situations are easier to understand when using a mixed methods research approach, compared to <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>qualitative</b> or quantitative research approach. There are more than fifteen mixed method design typologies that have been identified. Because these typologies share many characteristics and criteria, they have been classified into six different types. Three of these types are sequential, meaning that one type of data collection and analysis happens before the other. The other three designs are concurrent, meaning both qualitative and quantitative data are collected at the same time.|$|E
5000|$|Place {{attachment}} is deﬁned as one's {{emotional or}} affective ties to a place, and is generally {{thought to be}} the result of a long-term connection with a certain environment. This is different from a simple aesthetic response such as saying a certain place is special because it is beautiful. For example, one can have an emotional response to a beautiful (or ugly) landscape or place, but this response may sometimes be shallow and ﬂeeting. This distinction is one that Schroeder labeled [...] "meaning versus preference". According to Schroeder the definition of [...] "meaning" [...] is [...] "the thoughts, feelings, memories and interpretations evoked by a landscape"; whereas [...] "preference" [...] is [...] "the degree of liking for one landscape compared to another". For a deeper and lasting emotional attachment to develop (Or in Schroeder's terms, for it to have meaning) an enduring relationship with a place is usually a critical factor. Chigbu carried out a rural study of place-attachment <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>qualitative</b> approach to check its impact on a community, Uturu (in Nigeria), and found that it has direct relationship to level of community development.|$|E
5000|$|The {{collapse}} of the Dot-com bubble into the early 2000s brought about demands for greater corporate disclosure and accountability. The costly failure of many information technology (IT) initiatives caused many to point fingers at poor corporate and information governance. One location where the call {{for the development of}} new IT management and governance standards was answered was within non-government standards development body Standards Australia. An IT Management and Governance working group called IT-030 was announced in July 2002 and fully formed in August. The committee which drafted and recommended the publication included representatives from over 30 organizations, including the Australian Computer Society, Australian Bankers Association, Australian Institute of Company Directors, and Australia's Department of Defence. One of IT-030's first substantial meetings was held in Sydney September 24-26 with the goal of <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>qualitative</b> survey to gauge interest in developing a full standard. Those insights were discussed at a follow-up meeting in Canberra on September 30, agreeing that the [...] "'Governance of Information and Communications Technologies' would be a more accurate reflection of the emerging scope of the standard." [...] By late January 2003, draft documents of the standard began to appear. By September 2004, the draft standard was being presented at the 2004 Australian Computer Society National Conference in Melbourne, and submitted comments were being resolved, with an eye on a late 2004 publication. The final version was published in January 2005.|$|E
