50|$|North Down by-election, 1986 - <b>Ulster</b> <b>Popular</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> {{candidate}} won without Unionist opposition.|$|E
50|$|In 1980 Kilfedder {{formed the}} small <b>Ulster</b> <b>Popular</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> and contested all {{subsequent}} elections under this label.|$|E
5000|$|He was {{initially}} {{a member of}} the Ulster <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> but was expelled in June 1987 when he refused to withdraw from the general election of that year. He stood against the incumbent <b>Popular</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> MP Sir James Kilfedder in North Down as a [...] "Real Unionist" [...] but failed to win the seat.|$|R
25|$|Nonetheless, in the 1987 general {{election}} that he lost, Powell campaigned in Bangor for James Kilfedder, the devolutionist North Down <b>Popular</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> MP and against Robert McCartney, {{who was standing}} as a Real Unionist on a policy of integration and equal citizenship for Northern Ireland.|$|R
50|$|Green {{left the}} <b>Popular</b> <b>Unionists,</b> and was re-elected at the 1985 local {{elections}} for the Ulster <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party,</b> then in 1989 and 1993 for the Conservatives in Northern Ireland, standing down in 1997.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} the constituency {{has seen}} many substantial votes for smaller party groupings and individuals. The <b>Ulster</b> <b>Popular</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party,</b> the Conservative Party, the UK Unionist Party and the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition have all polled substantially {{in the last}} fifteen years, whilst in local council elections many independent candidates gain sufficient votes to be elected. The area is the heartland of numerous [...] "one-man parties", of which the <b>Ulster</b> <b>Popular</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> and the UK Unionist Party are the best known but far from the only ones. There have been many examples of elected individuals changing party allegiance and often successfully defending their seats for the new party.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Ulster</b> <b>Popular</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> (UPUP) was a unionist {{political}} party in Northern Ireland. It {{was founded in}} 1980 by James Kilfedder, independent Unionist Member of Parliament for North Down, who led the party {{until his death in}} 1995.|$|E
50|$|The North Down by-election, in the North Down constituency, {{was held}} on 15 June 1995, {{following}} the death of James Kilfedder, who had represented the constituency since the 1970 general election. Kilfedder had formed the <b>Ulster</b> <b>Popular</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> in 1980, but the party disintegrated on his death.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>unionist</b> <b>parties,</b> {{such as the}} Democratic <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> (DUP), the Ulster <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party,</b> (UUP) {{and other}} smaller parties such as the Progressive <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> (PUP) and Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) ...|$|R
50|$|Their {{position}} on {{the left of the}} political spectrum differentiates them from other <b>unionist</b> <b>parties</b> (such as the Ulster <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> and the Democratic <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party)</b> which are ideologically right-wing.|$|R
50|$|Of the British parties, the Conservative Party is {{explicitly}} unionist; it has formally {{been called the}} Conservative and <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> since a merger with the Liberal <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> in 1912. The Ulster <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> was affiliated with the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations until 1985. The Northern Ireland Conservatives are a minor <b>unionist</b> <b>party</b> in Northern Ireland.|$|R
50|$|In 1980 {{he formed}} the <b>Ulster</b> <b>Popular</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> (UPUP) and was re-elected under that label in all {{subsequent}} elections. He again topped the poll in the 1982 Assembly election and was elected as Speaker of the Assembly (to 1986). He generally took the Conservative whip at Westminster. Whilst Speaker {{he was paid}} more than the Prime Minister.|$|E
50|$|In 1981 {{the party}} {{admitted}} {{the weakness of}} its own position during the local government election campaign and that power-sharing on the 1973 model {{was no longer a}} viable option. The party fought the 1981 local elections in an electoral pact with the <b>Ulster</b> <b>Popular</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> but only won two seats. As a result in autumn 1981 the UPNI was formally dissolved. William Bailie, their last remaining councillor, joined the Alliance Party and was re-elected as an Alliance councillor in North Down.|$|E
50|$|The 1986 Northern Ireland by-elections were fifteen by-elections held on 23 January 1986, to fill {{vacancies}} in the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{caused by}} the resignation in December 1985 of all sitting Unionist Members of Parliament (MPs). The MPs, from the Ulster Unionist Party, Democratic Unionist Party and <b>Ulster</b> <b>Popular</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party,</b> did this to highlight {{their opposition to the}} Anglo-Irish Agreement. Each of their parties agreed not to contest seats previously held by the others, and each outgoing MP stood for re-election.|$|E

50|$|The 1986 Belfast East {{by-election}} {{was one of}} {{the fifteen}} 1986 Northern Ireland by-elections held on 23 January 1986, to fill vacancies in the Parliament of the United Kingdom caused by the resignation in December 1985 of all sitting Unionist Members of Parliament (MPs). The MPs, from the Ulster Unionist Party, Democratic Unionist Party and <b>Ulster</b> <b>Popular</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party,</b> did this to highlight their opposition to the Anglo-Irish Agreement.

5000|$|At the 1973 Northern Ireland Assembly election, Green {{stood in}} North Down for the Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party, {{but he was}} not elected. [...] Through his role in the USCA, he was a {{prominent}} leader of the Ulster Workers' Council strike, and was able to gain election to the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention. [...] Soon after, he left Vanguard to join the United Ulster Unionist Party split, but this was collapsing by 1980, and Green instead joined James Kilfedder's <b>Ulster</b> <b>Popular</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party,</b> for which he very narrowly missed being elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly, 1982.|$|E
5000|$|Kilfedder died in 1995 and his loose <b>Ulster</b> <b>Popular</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> {{faded away}} {{even before the}} {{resulting}} by-election. By this time the Northern Ireland Conservatives had collapsed heavily {{and so there was}} much speculation about how the by-election would go. The Ulster Unionist Party were hopeful that they could retake the seat, but McCartney also stood, this time as a [...] "UK Unionist" [...] {{with the support of the}} Democratic Unionist Party. No candidate stood for the Popular Unionists or any nationalist party. There was a poor turnout in which McCartney won, with the Conservative vote collapsing from 32% to 2.1%.|$|E

50|$|The Democratic <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party,</b> {{the largest}} {{party in the}} Northern Ireland Assembly, and the Ulster <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party,</b> the second largest <b>unionist</b> <b>party,</b> welcomed the review, as did the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland. The PSNI and the {{government}} of the Republic of Ireland also welcomed the process.|$|R
25|$|The {{major parties}} {{standing}} were the Democratic <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> (DUP) and the Ulster <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> (UUP) on the Unionist side, and Sinn Féin and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) on the Nationalist side. The largest cross-community party, the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, contested {{the election in}} 17 of 18 constituencies. Smaller parties also included the Progressive <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party,</b> the Green Party and the UK <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party.</b> Some independent <b>Unionists</b> also stood.|$|R
50|$|The {{parliamentary}} constituency was original {{held by the}} Ulster Unionist Party with {{no serious}} opposition. In 1970 James Kilfedder was first elected and he proceeded to accumulate {{a high level of}} personal popularity in the constituency. In 1977 he left the Ulster Unionists in protest over their increasing support for Enoch Powell's proposed policy of integration for Northern Ireland, rather than the restoration of devolved government. Standing as an independent Unionist, Kilfedder successfully defended his seat against a UUP challenge in the 1979 general election. The following year he formed the <b>Ulster</b> <b>Popular</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party,</b> with a few local councillors being elected on the label.|$|E
50|$|The decline {{was evident}} {{even before the}} local {{government}} elections of 1981 as 4 of the 12 UUUP councillors elected in 1977 had defected to other Unionist parties (2 to UUP, 1 to DUP and 1 to the <b>Ulster</b> <b>Popular</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party).</b> The party had a miserable showing in the 1981 elections with its overall vote share declining from 2.8% in 1977 to 0.7% in 1981. It only managed to win 5 council seats (a decline of 7 seats) and even then one of these was purely due to a quirk of the electoral system, as the party only polled 105 votes (1.6%) in Lisburn 'E' against 1,909 (30.0%) for the DUP and 1,830 (28.7%) for the UUP. However they benefited from the other two Unionist parties only putting up one candidate each and benefitted from hefty transfers to win an unlikely seat.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1966 {{elections}} to the Westminster parliament, the Ulster <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> won 11 of Northern Ireland's available 12 seats, while in 1969 Stormont elections some 39 {{out of the}} 52 available seats (i.e., 75%) went to the Unionist and Unofficial <b>Unionist</b> <b>parties.</b> The Stormont Assembly returned the Protestant Official <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> (later Ulster <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party)</b> to office continuously between Northern Ireland's founding in 1922 and {{the dissolution of the}} Assembly in 1972.|$|R
50|$|The {{major parties}} {{standing}} were the Democratic <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> (DUP) and the Ulster <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> (UUP) on the Unionist side, and Sinn Féin and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) on the Nationalist side.

50|$|Robert Lindsay Mason (April 1942 - 25 August 2006), {{known as}} Lindsay Mason, was a unionist {{politician}} in Northern Ireland. Known {{as something of}} an eccentric, Mason's entire career in politics was spent outside the major <b>unionist</b> <b>parties</b> such as the Ulster <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> and the Democratic <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|R

25|$|Of the {{two main}} <b>Unionist</b> <b>parties</b> in Northern Ireland, the amended {{versions}} of Articles 2 and 3 have been accepted by the Ulster <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> but rejected by the Democratic <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> as not representing an improvement on their predecessors. The DUP has, in recent elections, become the largest political party in Northern Ireland.|$|R
50|$|The Member of Parliament {{since the}} 2010 general {{election}} is Ian Paisley Jr. of the Democratic <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party.</b> He succeeded his father, the Rev. Dr. Ian Paisley, who was initially elected in the 1970 general election {{as a member}} of the Protestant <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> but since 1971 has sat for the Democratic <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|R
25|$|Attempts {{to secure}} its {{operation}} {{on a permanent}} basis had been frustrated by disagreements between the two main <b>unionist</b> <b>parties</b> (the Democratic <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> and the Ulster <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party)</b> and Sinn Féin, the largest nationalist <b>party.</b> <b>Unionists</b> refused {{to participate in the}} Good Friday Agreement's institutions alongside Sinn Féin until they were assured that the IRA had discontinued its activities, decommissioned its arms and disbanded.|$|R
