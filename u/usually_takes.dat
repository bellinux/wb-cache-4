5|$|Higher {{education}} students normally attend university from age 18 onwards, where they study for an academic degree. There are over 90universities in England, {{all but one}} of which are public institutions. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is the government department responsible for higher education in England. Students are generally entitled to student loans {{to cover the cost of}} tuition fees and living costs. The first degree offered to undergraduates is the Bachelor's degree, which <b>usually</b> <b>takes</b> three years to complete. Students are then able to work towards a postgraduate degree, which <b>usually</b> <b>takes</b> one year, or towards a doctorate, which takes three or more years.|$|E
5|$|In July 2005, ECMA {{submitted}} to ISO/IEC JTC 1, via the latter's Fast-Track process, {{the standards and}} related TRs. This process <b>usually</b> <b>takes</b> 6–9 months.|$|E
5|$|The {{extraction}} of the useful components of oil shale <b>usually</b> <b>takes</b> place above ground (ex-situ processing), although several newer technologies perform this underground (on-site or in-situ processing).|$|E
50|$|The two {{government}} regulated {{educational qualifications}} are the Junior Certificate (<b>usually</b> <b>taken</b> at 15/16) and the Leaving Certificate (<b>usually</b> <b>taken</b> at {{between the ages}} of 17 and 19).|$|R

5|$|Fertilization by a spermatozoon, when it occurs, <b>usually</b> <b>takes</b> {{place in}} the ampulla, the widest section of the fallopian tubes. A fertilized egg {{immediately}} begins the process of embryogenesis, or development. The developing embryo takes about three days to reach the uterus and another three days to implant into the endometrium. It has usually reached the blastocyst stage {{at the time of}} implantation.|$|E
5|$|Microbial {{culture from}} a throat swab is a {{reliable}} and affordable alternative to an RST which has high sensitivity and specificity. However, a culture requires special facilities and <b>usually</b> <b>takes</b> 48 hours to give a result, whereas an RST can give a result within several minutes.|$|E
50|$|In Scotland, {{students}} <b>usually</b> <b>take</b> Highers and Advanced Highers.|$|R
50|$|Each part has 10 essay questions. The {{pass mark}} is 50. The parts 1-2 are <b>usually</b> <b>taken</b> in October {{and the rest}} are <b>usually</b> <b>taken</b> in March. One {{does not need to}} pass all four parts in one year. After passing all the written exams, there is an oral exam.|$|R

5|$|Most ants are univoltine, {{producing}} {{a new generation}} each year. During the species-specific breeding period, new reproductives, females, and winged males leave the colony in {{what is called a}} nuptial flight. The nuptial flight <b>usually</b> <b>takes</b> place in the late spring or early summer when the weather is hot and humid. Heat makes flying easier and freshly fallen rain makes the ground softer for mated queens to dig nests. Males typically take flight before the females. Males then use visual cues to find a common mating ground, for example, a landmark such as a pine tree to which other males in the area converge. Males secrete a mating pheromone that females follow. Males will mount females in the air, but the actual mating process <b>usually</b> <b>takes</b> place on the ground. Females of some species mate with just one male but in others they may mate with as many as ten or more different males, storing the sperm in their spermathecae.|$|E
5|$|The Summer Festival <b>usually</b> <b>takes</b> {{place over}} the fourth weekend of July. Events at the festival recall the lumbering history of the park. Log rolling, axe throwing, and {{cross-cut}} sawing events are held, as are horseshoe and seed spitting contests. Black Moshannon Lake is open to canoe races and fishing. A Saturday night bonfire party is held at the beach, with music and refreshments.|$|E
5|$|Art {{projects}} {{continue in}} various ways. Each year in April a well dressing competition is organised around a theme {{set by the}} Malvern Spa Association, with Gold, Silver and Bronze awards presented to adult's and children's groups. The well dressing initiative <b>usually</b> <b>takes</b> place {{over a period of}} four or five days with the Malvern spouts starting the annual season of well dressing around the country in the Derbyshire tradition. In 2003, photographer Bob Bilsland gave permission to the BBC to publish 21 of his special panaoramic views of the decorated wells and spouts.|$|E

5|$|Birth <b>usually</b> <b>takes</b> {{place in}} the water and {{typically}} produces a single pup weighing 1.4 to 2.3kg (3 to 5lb). Twins occur in 2% of births; however, usually only one pup survives. At birth, the eyes are open, ten teeth are visible, and the pup has a thick coat of baby fur. Mothers have been observed to lick and fluff a newborn for hours; after grooming, the pup's fur retains so much air, the pup floats like a cork and cannot dive. The fluffy baby fur is replaced by adult fur after about 13 weeks.|$|E
5|$|Christchurch {{holds an}} annual music festival {{on the first}} weekend in July. Originally a folk festival, the event has evolved to cater for {{a wider variety of}} tastes: clog and morris dancing groups and salsa and belly dancing {{exhibitions}} have featured. Rock bands and soul groups have been included alongside the more traditional types of music. The festival's format changes annually but <b>usually</b> <b>takes</b> place on and around the town quay where a large marquee contains the main stage. Local bars often host smaller bands and dancing and exhibitions take place throughout the town centre.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 2015, Donecle, a Toulouse {{start-up}} company, {{has also}} launched a drone approach which was initially specialized in {{the detection of}} lightning strikes on aeroplanes. Performed by five people equipped with harnesses and platforms, this inspection <b>usually</b> <b>takes</b> about eight hours. The immobilization of the aircraft and the staff are costly for the airlines, estimated at $10 000 per hour. The solution proposed by the start-up lasts twenty minutes.|$|E

5|$|Immune {{complexes}} (aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgG and IgM antibodies) {{deposited in}} various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions. Type IV hypersensitivity (also known as cell-mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity) <b>usually</b> <b>takes</b> {{between two and}} three days to develop. Type IV reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases, but may also involve contact dermatitis (poison ivy). These reactions are mediated by T cells, monocytes, and macrophages.|$|E
5|$|It interbreeds {{regularly}} and extensively with the mallard, {{to which it}} is closely related. The female lays six to fourteen oval eggs, which have smooth shells and come in varied shades of white and buff green. Hatching takes 30 days on average. Incubation <b>usually</b> <b>takes</b> 25 to 26 days, with both sexes sharing duties, although the male usually defends the territory until the female reaches the middle of her incubation period. It takes about six weeks to fledge. Once the eggs hatch, the hen leads the brood to rearing areas with abundant invertebrates and vegetation.|$|E
5|$|RNA viruses: Replication <b>usually</b> <b>takes</b> {{place in}} the cytoplasm. RNA viruses can be placed into four {{different}} groups depending on their modes of replication. The polarity (whether or not {{it can be used}} directly by ribosomes to make proteins) of single-stranded RNA viruses largely determines the replicative mechanism; the other major criterion is whether the genetic material is single-stranded or double-stranded. All RNA viruses use their own RNA replicase enzymes to create copies of their genomes.|$|E

50|$|In the UK, some {{club and}} Premier League {{football}} matches and tournaments <b>usually</b> <b>take</b> place on Sundays. Rugby matches and tournaments <b>usually</b> <b>take</b> place in club grounds or parks on Sunday mornings.

5|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} in Eriophorum angustifolium {{begins with}} flowering in spring or early summer (in or around May), when groups of 3–5 brown flowers are produced. Fertilisation <b>usually</b> <b>takes</b> place in May or June, via anemophily (wind-pollination), {{and the white}} bristle-like perianth, composed of achenes with pappi (seeds with hairs) then grows outwards to appear like short tufts of cotton thread. These pappi endure well into summer, lasting from around June to September. Like the pappus of Taraxacum (dandelions), this aids in wind-dispersal, and also serves as thermal insulation, conserving {{the temperature of the}} plant's reproductive organs by trapping solar radiation.|$|E
5|$|The {{coronation}} <b>usually</b> <b>takes</b> place {{several months}} {{after the death of}} the previous monarch, as it is considered a joyous occasion that would be inappropriate while mourning continues. This interval also gives the planners enough time to complete the elaborate arrangements required. For example, Queen ElizabethII was crowned on 2June 1953, having ascended the throne on 6February 1952; the date of her coronation was announced almost a year in advance, and preparations inside the abbey took five months.|$|E
5|$|The {{head and}} hands are {{coloured}} using {{a blend of}} oil, water and acrylic colour. From the mould, the body is cast in fibreglass, and the head and hands are fitted to the fiberglass body and dressed in clothes that are often donated by the celebrity. The pose, clothes and expression on the face all contribute to making the figure as realistic as possible. The whole process <b>usually</b> <b>takes</b> {{up to six months}} by a team of 20 people to create and cost about HK$1 million each.|$|E
50|$|Property {{derivatives}} <b>usually</b> <b>take</b> {{the form}} of a total return swap, forward contract, futures, or can adopt a funded format where the property derivative is embedded into a bond or note structure. Under the total return swap or forward contract the parties will <b>usually</b> <b>take</b> contrary positions on the price movements of a property index. See Exotic derivative.|$|R
