25|$|Some {{researchers}} came to {{the conclusion}} that children growing <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>these</b> tightly knit communities tended to see the other children around them as ersatz siblings and preferred to seek mates outside the community when they reached maturity. Some theorize that living amongst one another on a daily basis virtually from birth on produced an extreme version of the Westermarck effect, which diminished teenage kibbutzniks' sexual attraction to one another. Partly as a result of not finding a mate from within the kibbutz, youth often abandon kibbutz life as adults.|$|E
25|$|U.S. {{immigration}} policies shape {{the opportunities for}} 16.6 million mixed immigrant families. The experiences of mixed immigrant status families {{need to be in}} sharper focus, especially the effects on children growing <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>these</b> families. There are an estimated 5.5 million children with unauthorized immigrant parents, about three-quarters of whom are U.S. born citizens. The nature of immigration policy dehumanizes individuals in mixed status families through practices that threat and harm, such as deportation procedures, which is when a migrant is formally removed from the United States and is banned from reentering. Immigration policies and practices do not only affect the undocumented population itself. However, U.S. born children growing up in families where there are undocumented members living are negatively impacted by these policies.|$|E

25|$|Immigrant {{children}}—defined {{as those}} {{children under age}} eighteen who are either foreign-born or U.S.-born to immigrant parents—now account for one-fourth of the nation’s 75 million children. By 2050 they are projected to make up one-third of more than 100 million U.S. children. This highlights that children of immigrants in mixed status families are growing in the United States. Therefore, it is of high importance to understand their experiences {{in this country and}} the impact that a mixed status has on the children growing <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>these</b> families facing unique needs and challenges. Mixed immigrant families’ rights are being violated. When there is family separation through immigration practices, children in mixed status household are denied the right to grow up with their families. They are dehumanized, based on status of their parents.|$|E
25|$|Emmy Werner {{was one of}} {{the early}} {{scientists}} to use the term resilience in the 1970s. She studied a cohort of children from Kauai, Hawaii. Kauai was quite poor and many {{of the children in the}} study grew up with alcoholic or mentally ill parents. Many of the parents were also out of work. Werner noted that of the children who grew <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>these</b> detrimental situations, two-thirds exhibited destructive behaviors in their later teen years, such as chronic unemployment, substance abuse, and out-of-wedlock births (in case of teenage girls). However, one-third of these youngsters did not exhibit destructive behaviours. Werner called the latter group 'resilient'. Thus, resilient children and their families were those who, by definition, demonstrated traits that allowed them to be more successful than non-resilient children and families.|$|E
25|$|Cedar Creek Lake is {{a fourth}} water source for Tarrant Regional Water District's water supply. Its normal system {{capacity}} is 322.00ft(98.15m) above sea level. When the lake gets over that point, gates from the spillway are opened, releasing water; 2005 and 2006 were dry years, sending {{the lake to}} a record low on December 12, 2006. The lake fell to 8.04ft(2.45m) below normal, at 313.96ft(95.7m). This passed the old record of 6.22ft(2m) low set on May 8, 1981. That afternoon, the lake received over 4in(102mm) of rain, causing the lake to rise about 6in(152mm). This was the first significant rainfall since April 2006. It was the big turning point for the drought in North Texas, as more rain continued through the month. By January 1, the lake was only a little over 6 feet (2 m) low. Huge rainstorms throughout January brought the lake to only 2 feet (0.6 m) low. A bit of a break came in February, as mainly snow and ice added to the lake rising. By March 31, 2007, the lake was at 322.12ft(98.18m) and the flood gates were open {{for the first time}} since April 20, 2005. Lake Benbrook, Lake Worth, and Lake Arlington also filled <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>these</b> rains.

It was a milestone for Tarrant regional water district having all seven of their lakes full. On the night of July 5, more than 5in(127mm) of rain fell, sending Cedar Creek lake from a half foot (15cm) over to 1.5 feet (45cm) over, beating the old 1.47ft(0m) set in November 2001.|$|E

[...] Swift said in a 2012 interview with Cosmopolitan that White Horse is in fact her favorite song to sing live, [...] "a song that I've always been proud of because it's about that really horrible feeling of a one-sided relationship that isn't balanced; it's one-sided.
