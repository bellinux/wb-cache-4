Although he voices strong support, he also believes that legislation should be passed that adds a public option to the insurance mandate and repeals the ban on the government negotiating for lower drug prices. Lessig has proposed prize funding drug research and banning drug companies from negotiating with generic drug providers to delay entry into the market.|$|E

In which it gathers various perspectives about the two beatings, and brings <b>us</b> <b>closer</b> to the brutal reality of China’s “crackdown on crime”.|$|E

500|$|Survivor {{contains}} themes {{interpreted by}} the public as {{a reference to the}} group's internal conflict. The title track, [...] "Survivor", which set the theme used throughout the album, features the lyrics [...] "I'm not gonna blast you on the radio... I'm not gonna lie on you or your family... I'm not gonna hate you in the magazine" [...] caused [...] Roberson and Luckett to file a lawsuit against the group; the lyrics were perceived to be a violation over their agreement following a settlement in court. In an interview, Knowles commented: [...] "The lyrics to the single 'Survivor' are Destiny's Child's story, because we've been through a lot,... We went through our drama with the members... Any complications we've had in our 10-year period of time have made <b>us</b> <b>closer</b> and tighter and better." [...] In another song called [...] "Fancy", which contains the lyrics [...] "You always tried to compete with me, girl... find your own identity", was interpreted by critic David Browne, in his review of the album for Entertainment Weekly magazine, {{as a response to the}} lawsuit. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic summarized Survivor as [...] "a determined, bullheaded record, intent on proving Destiny's Child has artistic merit largely because the group survived internal strife.... It's a record that tries to be a bold statement of purpose, but winds up feeling forced and artificial." [...] Despite the album's receiving critical praise, Knowles' close involvement has occasionally generated criticism. Knowles wrote and co-produced the bulk of Survivor. Browne suggested that her help made Survivor a [...] "premature, but inevitable, growing pains album". In the majority of the songs on their final studio album Destiny Fulfilled (2004), the verses are divided into three sections, with Knowles singing first, followed by Rowland, then Williams; the three harmonize together during the choruses.|$|E

2500|$|In August 2012, Stephen M. Walt, Robert and Renée Belfer {{professor}} of international relations at Harvard University, argued that the collective sabre rattling from Israel's politicians, and repeated assertions about [...] "closing windows," [...] "red lines," [...] and [...] "zones of immunity," [...] with regard to an imminent Israeli attack against Iran, was bluff. In his analysis Israel lacks the military means alone to cause sufficient damage to Iran's nuclear facilities. The wave of public declarations constitutes a campaign, he continues, whose purpose is to pressure the Obama administration to impose both stricter sanctions and extract a public undertaking by President Obama that {{he is willing to}} use force. In his view, this ploy intends to inch the <b>U.S.</b> <b>closer</b> to declaring a war that Israel on its own itself cannot undertake.|$|E
2500|$|Woolf's [...] "Modern Fiction" [...] essay {{focuses on}} how writers should write {{or what she}} hopes for them to write. Woolf does not suggest a {{specific}} way to write instead she wants writers to simply write what interests {{them in any way}} that they choose to write. Woolf suggests, “Any method is right, every method is right, that expresses what we wish to express, if we are writers; that brings <b>us</b> <b>closer</b> to the novelist's intention if we are readers". Woolf wanted writers to express themselves {{in such a way that}} it showed life as it should be seen not as [...] "a series of gig lamps symmetrically arranged". She set out to inspire writers of modern fiction by calling for originality, criticizing those who focused on the unimportant things, and comparing the differences of cultural authors, all for the sake of fiction and literature.|$|E
2500|$|Judaism {{has often}} {{emphasize}} strict monotheism and [...] "exclusivity of the divinity" [...] and prayer directly to God; references to angels or other intermediaries are not typically seen in Jewish liturgy or in siddurs (prayerbooks). Maimonides' fifth principle of faith states that [...] "I believe with perfect faith {{that it is}} only proper to pray to God," [...] and this is often seen as stating that [...] "One may not pray to anyone or anything else. This principle teaches that God is the only one whom we may serve and praise... It is therefore not proper to serve (angels, stars, or other elements) or make them intermediaries to bring <b>us</b> <b>closer</b> to God." [...] Talmudic literature does show that some evidence that Jewish prayers invoking angels and other intermediaries existed in the 1st century CE, and several examples of post-Talmudic prayers exist, including a familiar piyyut (liturgical song) entitled [...] "Usherers of Mercy," [...] recited before and after Rosh Hashanah in Selichot (Jewish penitential prayers).|$|E

2500|$|Ford {{had opposed}} America's entry into World War II and {{continued}} to believe that international business could generate the prosperity that would head off wars. Ford [...] "insisted that war {{was the product of}} greedy financiers who sought profit in human destruction"; in 1939 he {{went so far as to}} claim that the torpedoing of U.S. merchant ships by German submarines was the result of conspiratorial activities undertaken by financier war-makers. The financiers to whom he was referring was Ford's code for Jews; he had also accused Jews of fomenting the First World War. In the run-up to World War II and when the war erupted in 1939, he reported that he did not want to trade with belligerents. Like many other businessmen of the Great Depression era, he never liked or entirely trusted the Franklin Roosevelt Administration, and thought Roosevelt was inching the <b>U.S.</b> <b>closer</b> to war. However, Ford continued to do business with Nazi Germany, including the manufacture of war materiel.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} in 2008, Scot McCloud said that in Reinventing Comics he was [...] "shooting for the moon, in hopes that we could create these radical departures from traditional comics," [...] noting that [...] "most online comics are still pretty conservative in format and style" [...] but also that [...] "there have been some impressive strides in that direction." [...] McCloud specified {{that he was still}} keeping an eye on things that needed to happen for the infinite canvas to take off, saying that [...] "the notion of Web applications being as robust as desktop applications has placed <b>us</b> <b>closer</b> to that hope that we may finally be able to create those spaces in a seamless way online. Right now, it's very difficult to do that." [...] In {{an interview}} in 2014, McCloud said that [...] "without a reliable financial structure to support these experimental webcomics, {{a lot of people just}} turn away and get a real job, or start doing three-panel gag strips. Those have an economic model that works." ...|$|E
