40|$|Background and Objectives: The holmium laser has a short {{absorption}} {{depth in}} tissue and possesses excellent properties both in ablation and hemostasis. We have performed endoscopic incision for ureteral stricture using the holmium laser through a small-caliber ureteroscope. Methods: This method was used on five patients and seven ureters. The etiology of the stricture was stone scar in two patients, ureteroenteroanastomosis of Indiana <b>urinary</b> <b>pouch</b> in two, and primary in one. We used an 8 F semi-rigid or 6. 9 F flexible ureteroscope. No prior procedures, such as balloon dilation, were necessary {{in any of}} the cases. The stricture was incised with the holmium laser using a 365 -µm fiber through the working channel of the ureteroscope. The holmium laser operated at a wavelength of 2100 nm, with an output of 1. 0 J/pulse at a rate of 10 Hz. After completion of the incision, a 12 F Double-J catheter was left in for six weeks. Results: The mean operative time was 89 minutes. The stricture resolved completely in all cases at an average follow-up of 8. 6 months. Conclusions: The holmium laser incision for ureteral stricture using a small-caliber ureteroscope is an easy-toperform, safe and effective procedure...|$|E
40|$|A 49 -year-old female visited our {{hospital}} because of bloody {{discharge from the}} urethra. On examination, an elastic-soft mass was palpable beneath the anterior vaginal wall. The vaginal mucosa was intact. Cystourethroscopy demonstrated neither tumor nor diverticular orifice. Pathological specimen obtained by needle biopsy revealed clear cell adenocarcinoma. The patient underwent anterior pelvic exenteration and modified Kock <b>pouch</b> <b>urinary</b> diversion. The microscopic appearance suggested that the tumor arose from the paraurethral duct. Stains for prostatic specific antigen and prostate specific acid phosphatase were negative. Forty cases of clear cell adenocarcinoma of the female urethra {{reported in the literature}} were reviewed...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} rare case ofcolonic {{adenocarcinoma}} occurring in an Indiana pouch. A 68 -year-old man underwent radical cystectomy with Indiana <b>pouch</b> <b>urinary</b> diversion {{for the treatment}} of bladder cancer 16 years ago. He was referred to our hospital {{for the treatment of}} a right staghorn stone, left renal stone, and pouch stones. Cystoscopic findings showed a 10 × 10 mm tumor distal to ureter anastomosis. Under the diagnosis of colonic adenocarcinoma in an Indiana pouch, tumor and stones were successfully removed. Adenocarcinoma occurrence after ureterosigmoidostomy is well-known. However, diagnosis of adenocarcinoma in an Indiana pouch isextremely rare...|$|R
40|$|A 46 -year-old man {{underwent}} total cystectomy and Indiana <b>pouch</b> <b>urinary</b> diversion for bladder {{cancer in}} 2001. Pathological examination revealed an urothelial {{carcinoma of the}} bladder (pT 2 N 0 M 0). He was referred to our hospital for bilateral hydronephrosis in June 2009. Cytological examination of the urine was negative. Percutaneous nephrostomy was performed, and we suspected bilateral ureteral tumors from pyelo-ureterography. Percutaneous ureteroscopy revealed a papillary tumor in the right ureter. Since {{there appeared to be}} a papillary tumor in the left ureter, we decided to perform ureterectomy for bilateral ureteral tumors, and to keep the bilateral nephrostomy tube for urinary diversion. Pathological examination revealed urothelial carcinoma in bilateral ureters. There has been no sign of recurrence at 17 months after the operation...|$|R
30|$|Description of videopresentation: Pelvic exenteration is a salvage {{procedure}} {{done in the}} effort to eliminate completely recurrent pelvic cancer. The primary tumors are usually those of the cervix, rectum, vagina, endometrium or urinary bladder. The latest advances in the technique involve low coloanal laparoscopic anastomosis and continent urinary diversion enabling complete or modified pelvic evisceration without the need for external appliances. The port placement is demonstrated as well as the evaluation of operability with dissection of paravesical and pararectal spaces. After appropriate lymphadenectomy the dissection continues down until the pedicle containing lateral parametrium with uterine vessels, superior haemorrhoidal vessels and ureter. The ureter is completely dissected from above the pelvic brim around psoas muscle to the ureteral canal parametrial entrance. The en bloc dissection of the neoplasm is undertaken by coagulating/cutting instrument of laparoscopic plasmakinetic trissector. The ureter is clipped and divided at the parametrial entrance as distally as possible. In case of bladder removal the pelvic fascia is incised anteriorly, urethra identified, dissected, clipped and divided. If the colorectum must be removed the dissection continues posteriorly in the avascular plane towards the anal sphincter. The specimen is removed transperineally or vaginally. Further in the video we present side to end coloanal reanastomosis with circular stapler as well as the technique of <b>urinary</b> continent <b>pouch</b> reconstruction.|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim. Ever {{since the}} time when the first {{orthotopic}} <b>urinary</b> diversion (<b>pouch)</b> was performed there has been a constant improvement and modification of surgical techniques. The aim has been to create a urinary reservoir similar to normal bladder, to decrease incidence of postoperative complications and provide an improved life quality. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare postvoiding residual urine (PVR) and capacity of the pouch constructed by standard or modified technique. Methods. In this prospective and partially retrospective clinical study we included 79 patients. In the group of 41 patients (group ST) pouch was constructed using 50 - 70 cm of the ileum (standard technique). In the group of 38 patients (group MT) pouch was constructed using 25 - 35 cm of the ileum (modified technique). Postoperatively, PVR and pouch capacity were measured using ultrasound in a 3 -, 6 - and 12 -month period. Results. Postoperatively, an increase in PVR and pouch capacity was noticed in both groups. Twelve months postoperatively, PVR was significantly smaller in the group MT than in the group ST [23 (0 - 90) mL vs 109 (0 - 570) mL, p < 0, 001]. In the same period the pouch capacity was significantly smaller in the MT group than in the ST group [460 (290 - 710) mL vs 892 (480 - 2 050) mL, p < 0. 001]. Conclusion. Postoperatively, an increase in PVR and pouch capacity was noticed during a 12 -month period. A year following the operation the pouch created from a shorter ileal segment reached capacity of the 'normal' bladder with small PVR. The pouch created by standard technique developed an unnecessary large PVR and capacity...|$|R
40|$|To {{describe}} the technique, feasibility and early complications of "Rome pouch" urinary diversion. Thirty-five consecutive patients affected by advanced or recurrent gynecological cancers who required anterior or total pelvectomy entered the study. Rome pouch technique {{starts with the}} transection of terminal ileum about 12 cm from the ileocecal valve; the large colon is transected 15 - 20 cm distal to the hepatic flexure. The intestinal wall tension and internal pressure are reduced using 5 - 8 transverse teniamyotomies of the cecum. The efferent segment of the pouch is created either with the appendix or with the distal ileum. Operative data, intra- and early postoperative complications were recorded. Between February 2000 and March 2006, an ileocolonic <b>urinary</b> diversion (Rome <b>pouch)</b> {{was carried out in}} 35 patients affected by advanced or recurrent gynecologic malignancies. The average operative time to complete the anterior and total exenteration including reconstruction procedure was 285 (range, 230 - 350) and 320 (range 280 - 415) min, respectively. The average time in performing the Rome pouch technique was 60 min (range, 45 - 90). Overall postoperative complication rate (major and minor complications) was 82 % (29 patients). Febrile morbidity occurred in 26 patients (74 %). Wound complications and pelvic collection were found in 7 (20 %) and 6 (17 %) patients, respectively. Our experience demonstrated that Rome pouch technique represents a valid alternative in gynecology oncology for continent urinary diversion. This technique showed low rate of medical and early urologic complications. The simplicity of performing the procedure and the reduced operating time are the best goals reached by Rome pouch technique. Future comparative trials will better define the role that the Rome pouch will have in these patients...|$|R
