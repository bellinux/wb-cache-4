5|$|The {{project was}} divided into three phases, {{expected}} to cost a total of $68million. Phase1 consisted of the prevention of erosion along the shorelines, improvements to the nearby drainage system, {{and the construction of}} dikes and aboiteaux; the work was carried out from 7 July 2008, to 14 April 2010. Phase2 consists of opening the gates to monitor river flow, both <b>upstream</b> <b>and</b> <b>downstream,</b> for two years. Phase3, commenced in 2012, consisted of the bridge's development and the removal of the causeway, and is anticipated to be completed in 2015. Confusion arose {{as to whether or not}} the project would be funded by the federal government. They refused, in spite of an earlier comment from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, which had hinted at a possible negotiation. Unwilling to wait, the provincial government came forward with an initial $20million on 7 July 2008, to begin the first phase.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{other data}} buses (e.g., Ethernet, HDMI), USB {{connections}} are directed, with both <b>upstream</b> <b>and</b> <b>downstream</b> ports emanating {{from a single}} host. This applies to electrical power, with only downstream facing ports providing power; this topology was chosen to easily prevent electrical overloads and damaged equipment. Thus, USB cables have different ends: A and B, with different physical connectors for each. Therefore, in general, each different format requires four different connectors: a plug and receptacle {{for each of the}} A and B ends. USB cables have the plugs, and the corresponding receptacles are on the computers or electronic devices. In common practice, the A end is usually the standard format, and the B side varies over standard, mini, and micro. The mini and micro formats also provide for USB On-The-Go with a hermaphroditic AB receptacle, which accepts either an A or a B plug. On-The-Go allows USB between peers without discarding the directed topology by choosing the host at connection time; it also allows one receptacle to perform double duty in space-constrained applications.|$|E

Upstream, the water surface must rise from a normal depth of 0.97 m to 9.21 m at the gate. The only way to do this on a mild reach is to follow an M1 profile. The same logic applies downstream to determine that the water surface follows an M3 profile from the gate until the depth reaches the conjugate depth of the normal depth at which point a hydraulic jump forms to raise the water surface to the normal depth.|$|E

Samin watershed in Central Java {{is one of}} 282 Indonesian watersheds which are in critical condition. Nowadays, the sustainability of forest resources in the upstream of Samin watershed is threatened by exploitation of forest by people. As a result, erosion and sedimentation are occurring in this area that may pose a threat of flooding and landslide. Therefore, we need serious measures to maintain the function of Samin watershed, {{one of which is}} through the monitoring of vegetation in watershed. The purpose of this research was to analyze the structure and composition of vegetation in Samin watershed to support soil and water conservation. The survey of vegetation was conducted in 3 areas of Samin watershed based on geophysical conditions namely <b>upstream,</b> midstream, <b>and</b> <b>downstream.</b> At each sampling area, 37 sampling plots were randomly distributed in six observation stations. Vegetation analysis was carried out in both the lower crop community (LCC) and the tree. Results showed that the number of LCC species found in the <b>upstream,</b> midstream, <b>and</b> <b>downstream</b> areas were 21, 34, and 28 respectively. The species diversity indexes of LCC vegetation in the <b>upstream,</b> midstream, <b>and</b> <b>downstream</b> areas were 1. 04, 1. 34, and 1. 23 respectively.
