It was introduced private property.In 1887 a severe economic crisis linked to the customs bloc with the France (main importer of cattle from the island) struck the Sardinia. This increased the deep latent discontent in the country, which resulted in the bloody events that shook the Barbagia in {{the last decade of the}} nineteenth century.In the early twentieth century were introduced industries for the production of cheese; the shepherd was transformed from master-merchant in keeper-milker. Thus was born the figure of the shepherd servant.In the beginning of the sixties was passed the Law on the Piano di Rinascita (Plan of Rebirth), which included the installation of factories in order to modernize an agricultural-pastoral economy to an industrial society.Although most of the laws for the betterment of the economy has not obtained the expected success and banditry has not eradicated, it is good to mention that in some areas where it was a process of transformation, we saw almost disappear or this phenomenon. This is the case of Gallura, that from the seventeenth century to the first half of the nineteenth century was the area most devastated by criminal incidents; after changing from nomadic to sedentary pastoral guidance, the Gallura banditry underwent an inflection up, almost to disappear altogether.Ignazio Pirastu, in his report also cites the example of the village of Oliena, according to a study done by Dr. Panico. The study has shown that the processes of rapid change of the regime and crop landowner paid equally rapid extinction of the phenomenon.In the conclusions of the investigation it is said: [...] "The argument that an intensive agrarian transformation and the resulting improved economic conditions, has paid Oliena a regression of the sheep-farming and a drop in crime is fully proven by the investigation conducted on the spot. The agrarian transformation in Oliena occurred in two periods: from 1934 to 1939 and 1945 to 1960.Consequently, it was noted a steady reduction of the sheep-farming: 40,000 sheep from the 1900 ran to 15,000 in 1951 and 10,000 in 1955.In this period we had in Oliena an overall decrease of the crimes, both against the person and against property. The thesis is then confirmed by a reverse phenomenon, occurring from 1960 to 1969. In this period it is in fact registered in Oliena an increase in crimes against the person and against property than in previous decades. This increase corresponds to a recovery of the sheep-farming. In fact, after the 1956 is a gradual increase in sheep and goats Oliena that, from 10,000 in 1955, rising to 21,000 in 1964 and, further, to 24.589 at the end of 1967." [...] Another test is made by the radical change in behavior of the colonies of the shepherds of Barbagia that have moved to other Italy regions and who have distinguished themselves, in general, hard work and honesty.|$|E

Field experiments were conducted at two sites in Vågå, Oppland, in 2013 and 2014. Quality of plant samples {{were taken from}} both CM and EUPL. EUPL at both sites had dry zones with pasture grasses, Agrostis capillaris, Poa spp., Festuca rubra and Anthoxanthum odoratum, and moist zones dominated by Deschampsia cespitosa. The EUPL`s were rich in species, had good grass coverage, and were representative {{of this type of}} pastures. Lamb growth on CM was in middle 320 g per day, while the middle growth rate on EUPL was 210 g. CM gave high and stable growth rate, while there were larger variations between sites and years on EUPL. Lambs grazed with their mother at one site, and here growth rate was somewhat higher than at the other site where lambs were separated from mother. Quality samples from CM had high energy value, in average 0. 93 feed units per kg dry matter. Pasture grasses from dry areas on EUPL had in average 0. 90 feed units per kg dry matter, Deschampsia cespitosa from moister parts 0. 73 feed units per kg dry matter. Deschampsia cespitosa had the poorest fiber quality. Lower lamb growth on EUPL can therefore be explained by lower feed quality of Deschampsia cespitosa...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} soil erosion was {{conducted}} in Australia using the fallout radioisotope caesium- 137 {{as an indicator of}} topsoil redistribution. Two hundred and six sites were sampled, 100 within rotational cropping and horticultural use, 52 within uncultivated permanent pasture and forest, and 54 in rangelands. Average net soil losses were approximately equal for cultivated cropping lands and rangelands (ca. 5. 5 t ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹), and just over 1 t ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ for pasture and forest. The Mann Whitney U Test revealed that losses under cropping and rangeland conditions were significantly higher (p < 0. 05) than under <b>uncultivated</b> <b>pasture</b> and forest. Soil loss was negatively correlated with mean annual rainfall and slope gradient, and positively correlated with slope length (Spearman's rank correlation). There was no correlation between rates of soil loss and a rainfall erosi-vity index. An assessment of erosional events was provided by landholders for 104 sites, with their ranking being weakly but significantly correlated with soil loss estimates (r =+ 0. 35). Sixty percent of sites had net soil losses greater than 1 t ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹, and 74 % of sites had losses of more than 0. 5 t ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹. This latter rate may be regarded as a limit for a tolerable level of soil loss. These high rates of soil loss have occurred since the mid- 1950 s despite there being significant landholder awareness of the soil erosion hazard...|$|E

Surface boulder concentrations {{on the surface}} of till sheets are ubiquitous features of the Late Wisconsinan Rainy lobe. They occur irrespective of topography or position on the landscape and are commonly found littering the surface of <b>uncultivated</b> <b>pastures</b> and wooded areas within the Wadena and Brainerd drumlin fields of central Minnesota and the Toimi drumlin field and the Rögen moraine of northeastern Minnesota. Previous work in these locations noted the occurrence of surface boulders but dismissed them as an erosional lag or resulting from periglacial processes. Characterizations of boulder lithologies, the composition and texture of the underlying till, and mean transport length suggest {{that this is not the}} case, and that surface boulder concentrations are primary features of till deposition. We present models for surface boulder deposition in both lodgement till and deforming bed regimes...|$|R

5000|$|According to M.A.Khan, [...] "Islam {{introduced}} {{the distinction between}} private property and public property and made the rulers accountable to the people". Scholars F. Nomani and A. Rahnema state that public property in Islam refers to natural resources (forests, <b>pastures,</b> <b>uncultivated</b> land, water, mines, oceanic resources etc.) to which all humans have equal right. Such resources are considered the common property of the community. Such property is placed under the guardianship {{and control of the}} Islamic state, and can be used by any citizen, as long as that use does not undermine the rights of other citizens, according to Nomani and Rahnema.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} based on the {{registrar}} data on Risan and the surrounding settlements, created in 1704 by the Venetians. The Venetians took over the area in 1684, after the two century rule by the Turks. The registrar contains data on agriculture, fruit and olive growing and milling industry. The registrar includes these settlements: Risan, Orahovac, Krivoshije Gornje and Donje Ledenice, Kostanjice (Risan's and Perast's), Gornje and Donje Uble, Gornji and Donji Morinj and Bunovichi. This registrar provided many more data than what is usual for this type of document. Besides the names of real estate owner, the registrar provides names of the previous owners, the Turks or local (domicile) population, who sold the land or whose land was given away to the incomers. Many parcels bear the note as an old ownership. In addition to the land size, there are data on the quality and usage: plough land, <b>uncultivated,</b> untilled, stony, <b>pasture.</b> There are data on planted soil too: wine-grows, figs, olives, chestnuts. Gardens were described separately. In addition to the population basic demography, the registrar provides data on cattle, horses owned by individual families, and whose number is described in this paper. In addition to descriptive data on houses and accompanying buildings, the registrar also describes mills and their state, whether they are damaged or in function as well as threshing-floors. At the end of the registrar, there is a list of owners by places, size and type of cultivated land, wine-growing land and required taxes by individual and settlements...|$|R

Increased demand for corn for ethanol {{and the subsequent}} record high commodity prices has resulted in rapid expansion of corn and soy in the Midwestern U. S. Whether or not this expansion is replacing existing agricultural production or is expanding onto previously <b>uncultivated</b> grass or <b>pasture</b> land has profound implications for ecosystem services such as soil carbon storage, soil erosion prevention, and water quality. Several studies have used the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) to track fine scale land-use changes driven by corn and soy. However, these studies rarely account for the variability in data quality throughout the CDL's history. Here I compare established techniques {{as well as the}} application of USDA's Common Land Unit (CLU) data for removing `noise' from change rasters and quantifying the land covers lost to corn and soy expansion. I compare these estimates to equivalent measures from the National Agricultural Statistics Services (NASS) and use the discrepancy between them to identify spatial and temporal variability in CDL data that could influence land-use change study results. The CLU results differed little from established techniques, but both improved over direct comparisons of CDLs. Comparison to NASS data revealed pre- 2010 versions of the CDL underestimate corn and soy area much more than later versions, leading to the detection of illusory land-use change when they are compared to post- 2010 versions. Spatial and temporal variability resulted in errors that were several times larger than the trends the data are being used to detect. According to the CDL, approximately five million hectares of corn and soy expanded onto the grass, pasture, hay, and wheat between 2007 and 2012. However, over the same time period the CDL overestimated the amount of corn and soy expansion by 3. 5 million hectares in the unmodified treatment and 1. 5 million with cleaning methods applied. This work suggests that studies that use the CDL should test for and report variability and uncertainty in their results...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyze the {{differences}} between the home range landscape structure of resident and translocated brown hares during the non- hunting period (January-June). The trial was carried out in the typical hilly landscape of central Italy (Florence province, X = 1667003 Y = 4844543, ref. Rome, 1940). During the capture operations for the translocation, 20 hares were captured and equipped with a necklace radio tag (Biotrak, TW 3) : 6 hares (4 males and 2 females) were immediately released in the same non-hunting area where they had been captured and 14 hares (7 males and 7 females) were translocated in a neighbouring Hunting Territory. The tagged hares were localized, and/or sighted individually, 2 - 3 times a week, from mid January to mid June, 2007. UTM coordinates were determinated for each localization using a portable GPS than transferred on Arc View software. Animal movement extension was used to calculate Max, min and average daily movements. Kernel method was used to calculate each home range. Home range sizes also were calculated using the MCP method. Maximum distance from the releasing sites and maximum distance from centroid were also calculated for translocated hares and resident hares, respectively. Aerial photographs (scale 1 : 10000) geo-referenced and digitalized were used. 14 different land use categories were selected and digitalized in a vector format. These land use were composed by natural uses (woods, shrubs-area, river and ponds), agricultural uses (crops for game, orchards and gardens, grasses and <b>pastures,</b> <b>uncultivated</b> fields, winter and spring cereals, vineyards, tree orchards and poplars, olive orchards) and anthropomorphized uses (extractive and construction sites, road and urban areas). Landscape metrics for home range (patch density, edge density, fractal dimension, contagion) were calculated using FRAGSTATS software after rasterization process. Results showed that the Max distance from the releasing sites in the translocated hares was significantly greater than the maximum distance from centroid in the resident hares (simple = radius, or doubled = diameter), (1. 281 vs. 368 or 736 m, p < 0. 05). Home range sizes also differed in relationship to translocated and resident’s (Kernel 173 vs. 23 ha and MCP 63 vs. 9 ha p < 0. 05). Considering landscape structure indices, the translocated hares preferred landscape characterized by a lower density of patches and edges than the resident’s (70 vs. 152 n/ 100 ha and 258 vs. 448 m/ha, p< 0. 01). Moreover translocated hares preferred areas characterized by greater aggregation and a lower path shape complexity than resident’s (contagion index: 61 vs. 54 %; fractal dimension index: 1. 11 vs 1. 12, p< 0. 01). Either the home range sizes or the maximum distance from the releasing sites suggest that the translocated hares must be however released in suited habitats or the animal will move from their releasing point searching better habitats. The increased travels, increase the risk to be killed by the predators or by the vehicles in the crossing roads...|$|R
