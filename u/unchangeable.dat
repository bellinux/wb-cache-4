5|$|Final Fantasy IV offers twelve playable {{character}}s, {{each with}} a unique, <b>unchangeable</b> character class. During the game, the player can have a total of five, or fewer, characters in the party at any given time. The main character, Cecil Harvey, is a dark knight and {{the captain of the}} Red Wings, an elite air force unit of the kingdom of Baron. He serves the king alongside his childhood friend Kain Highwind, the commander of the Dragoons. Rosa Farrell is a white mage and archer, as well as Cecil's love interest. The Red Wings' airships were constructed by Cecil's friend, the engineer Cid Pollendina.|$|E

25|$|This {{commission}} {{resulted in}} a number of changes, implemented in 1993, which instituted provisions that (among other things) required a bride’s verbal consent to marriage, eliminated a father’s right to force his daughter to marry, and mandated the obtainment of a judge’s permission in cases of polygamy and a husband’s repudiation of his wife. Generally these reforms were considered superficial, but significant as an indicator that the Mudawana was not an <b>unchangeable</b> standard, as it had previously been perceived. Considering the religious origin of the laws, {{the fact that they had}} been amended at all was a significant step in demonstrating that they were subject to the process of ijtihad and not completely <b>unchangeable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dante {{addresses}} the topic in his De Vulgari Eloquentia. He {{argues that the}} Adamic language is of divine origin and therefore <b>unchangeable.</b> He also notes that according to Genesis, the first speech act is due to Eve, addressing the serpent, and not to Adam.|$|E

25|$|Narcissists tend to {{demonstrate}} {{a lack of interest}} in warm and caring interpersonal relationships. There are several ongoing controversies within narcissism literature, namely: whether narcissism is healthy or unhealthy; a personality disorder; a discrete or continuous variable; defensive or offensive; the same across genders; the same across cultures; and changeable or <b>unchangeable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Acceptance: A person's assent to {{the reality}} of a situation, {{recognizing}} a process or condition (often a difficult or uncomfortable situation) without attempting to change it, protest, or exit. Religions and psychological treatments often suggest the path of acceptance when a situation is both disliked and <b>unchangeable,</b> or when change may be possible only at great cost or risk.|$|E
25|$|I have no {{difficulty}} accepting the appellants' contention that {{whether or not}} sexual orientation is based on biological or physiological factors, which may {{be a matter of}} some controversy, it is a deeply personal characteristic that is either <b>unchangeable</b> or changeable only at unacceptable personal costs, and so falls within the ambit of s. 15 protection as being analogous to the enumerated grounds.|$|E
25|$|The Holy Scripture is not {{identical}} with divine revelation, but {{a part of}} it. Scriptures were written later by apostles and evangelists, who knew Jesus. They give infallible testimony of his teachings. Scripture thus belongs to Tradition in the larger sense, where it has an absolute priority, {{because it is the}} Word of God, and because it is the <b>unchangeable</b> testimony of the apostles of Christ, whose fullness the Church preserves with its tradition.|$|E
25|$|For {{the most}} part, the Reformed {{tradition}} did not modify the medieval {{consensus on the}} doctrine of God. God's character is described primarily using three adjectives: eternal, infinite, and <b>unchangeable.</b> Reformed theologians such as Shirley Guthrie have proposed that rather than conceiving of God {{in terms of his}} attributes and freedom to do as he pleases, the doctrine of God is to be based on God's work in history and his freedom to live with and empower people.|$|E
25|$|Grapples {{have been}} improved, with each {{character}} having more specialized grapple types {{than the previous}} game's <b>unchangeable</b> group of four grapples. Each character has choice of three out of seven grapples: Power, Speed, Technical, Brawler, Martial Arts, Luchadore, and Old School. Each character has as well a Clean/Dirty grapple and a Submission grapple, making the total of grapples five. A new power Irish whip has been included, giving more offense to the opponent but {{at the price of}} draining more stamina.|$|E
25|$|Sōshi (Japanese) {{means the}} {{creation}} of a Japanese family name (shi, Korean ssi), distinct from a Korean family name or seong (Japanese sei). Japanese family names represent the families they belong to and can be changed by marriage and other procedures, while Korean family names represent paternal linkages and are <b>unchangeable.</b> Japanese policy dictated that Koreans either could register a completely new Japanese family name unrelated to their Korean surname, or have their Korean family name, in Japanese form, automatically become their Japanese name if no surname was submitted before the deadline.|$|E
25|$|Jewish and Christian {{tradition}} viewed Moses as {{the author}} of Exodus and the entire Pentateuch, {{but by the end of}} the 19th century the increasing awareness of discrepancies, inconsistencies, repetitions and other features of the Pentateuch had led scholars to abandon this idea. In approximate round dates, the process which produced Exodus and the Pentateuch probably began around 600 BCE when existing oral and written traditions were brought together to form books recognisable as those we know, reaching their final form as <b>unchangeable</b> sacred texts around 400 BCE.|$|E
25|$|His old {{opinions}} about parliamentary reform seem still {{to cling to}} him—the only decided observation he ever made when the Bill was first explained {{to him and he}} said, ‘Well this is a new constitution’ and though he is of course very anxious for the success of your administration I am not at all clear that he is equally anxious for the measure upon which that success depends. The truth is that he never yielded at all upon the question till my own opinions had become very strong and perfectly <b>unchangeable,</b> and, even then, it was with the greatest difficulty that he could be reconciled to my supporting the question.|$|E
25|$|Philo {{wrote that}} God {{instructed}} the Israelites to offer unleavened bread and bitter herbs {{together with the}} Passover sacrifice because unleavened bread signified great haste and speed, while bitter herbs signified the life of bitterness and struggle that the Israelites endured as slaves. Philo also taught that the deeper meaning was that leavened and fermented foods rose, while unleavened foods remained low, and each of these states symbolized types of the soul. Leavening symbolized the haughty soul swollen with arrogance, while the unleavened symbolized the <b>unchangeable</b> and prudent soul choosing the middle way rather than extremes. The bitter herbs manifested a psychic migration from passion to impassivity and from wickedness to virtue. For, Philo taught, those who naturally and genuinely repented became bitter toward their former way of life, lamenting {{the time that they}} had given over to the seductive and deceitful mistress of desire, being deceived by desire when they ought to have renewed themselves and advanced in the contemplation of wisdom toward the goal of a happy and immortal life. And so, those who desired repentance ate the unleavened bread with bitter herbs; they first ate bitterness over their old and unendurable life, and then ate the opposite of boastful arrogance in meditation on humility. For, Philo concluded, the memory of former sins caused fear, and by restraining sin through recollection, brought profit to the mind.|$|E

500|$|According to the Upanishad, {{the entire}} {{universe}} evolves by Sankalpa (a thinking, ideation process), one becomes what one thinks, metaphysics affects physics, and it is ideation that helps retain the appearances of the world. Following renunciation from this universe, which is also called a Sankalpa, the meditating mind is {{to be focused on}} the Nirvikalpa (the <b>unchangeable)</b> or the <b>unchangeable</b> part (metaphysical reality). Varaha in verse 2.64 compares the [...] "samsara" [...] (cycle of rebirth) to the domain of karma, states Billington, one that is like a long dream ("swapna"), a delusion, a sea of sorrow. It defines jivanmukta as someone who has overcome and attained liberation from this samsara through self-knowledge.|$|E
500|$|With the {{development}} of serological typing, medical researchers were able to sort bacteria into different strains, or types. [...] When a person or test animal (e.g., a mouse) is inoculated with a particular type, an immune response ensues, generating antibodies that react specifically with antigens on the bacteria. [...] Blood serum containing the antibodies can then be extracted and applied to cultured bacteria. [...] The antibodies will react with other bacteria of the same type as the original inoculation. Fred Neufeld, a German bacteriologist, had discovered the pneumococcal types and serological typing; until Frederick Griffith's studies bacteriologists believed that the types were fixed and <b>unchangeable</b> {{from one generation to}} the next.|$|E
500|$|Final Fantasy IV, {{also known}} as Final Fantasy II for its initial North American release, is a {{role-playing}} video game developed and published by Square (now Square Enix) for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Released in 1991, it is the fourth main installment of the Final Fantasy series. The game's story follows Cecil, a dark knight, {{as he tries to}} prevent the sorcerer Golbez from seizing powerful crystals and destroying the world. He is joined on this quest by a frequently changing group of allies. Final Fantasy IV introduced innovations that became staples of the Final Fantasy series and role-playing games in general. Its [...] "Active Time Battle" [...] system was used in five subsequent Final Fantasy games, and unlike prior games in the series, IV gave each character their own <b>unchangeable</b> character class.|$|E
500|$|Further, {{in attacking}} the {{distortion}} principle's application, Gozdor also argued against the principle {{as a legal}} concept in the first place. He wrote, [...] "Regardless of the Court's rationale for its distortion principle, determining a First Amendment violation by measuring whether the government used a subsidy 'in ways which distorted the medium's usual functioning' suggests that forum functions become <b>unchangeable</b> once created." [...] He claimed the unworkability of the distortion principle in a hypothetical example, which would moot {{the very existence of}} the Legal Services Corporation. [...] "Taking the Velazquez rationale to its logical ends", he wrote, [...] "the LSC subsidy itself could become an unconstitutional speech restriction. If Congress substantially increased LSC appropriations in order to allow LSC to take all of its cases ... the functioning of the legal system would be distorted because such a subsidy likely would result in a dramatic increase in the federal courts' caseloads." [...] With this in mind, he concluded with a process by which the Court should have decided the case: a process leading to the upholding of the restriction by finding that LSC's purpose was in promoting the government's message, in contrast to a diversity of private views.|$|E
500|$|Service {{stated that}} Lenin could be [...] "moody and volatile", and Pipes deemed {{him to be}} [...] "a thoroughgoing misanthrope", a view {{rejected}} by Read, who highlighted many instances in which Lenin displayed kindness, particularly toward children. According to several biographers, Lenin was intolerant of opposition and often dismissed outright opinions that differed from his own. He could be [...] "venomous in his critique of others", exhibiting a propensity for mockery, ridicule, and ad hominem attacks on those who disagreed with him. He ignored facts that did not suit his argument, abhorred compromise, and very rarely admitted his own errors. He refused to change his opinions, until he rejected them completely, after which he would treat the new view {{as if it was}} just as <b>unchangeable.</b> Lenin showed no sign of sadism or of personally desiring to commit violent acts, but he endorsed the violent actions of others and exhibited no remorse for those killed for the revolutionary cause. Adopting an amoral stance, in Lenin's view the end always justified the means; according to Service, Lenin's [...] "criterion of morality was simple: does a certain action advance or hinder the cause of the Revolution?" ...|$|E
500|$|In the Church's mythology, Jehovah1 had {{intended}} for Dobbs {{to lead a}} powerful conspiracy and brainwash individuals to make them work for a living. Dobbs refused to support the group; instead, he infiltrated it and organized a counter-movement. Church leaders teach {{that he was a}} very intelligent child and, as he grew older, studied several religious traditions, including Sufism, Rosicrucianism, and the Fourth Way. Another key event in his life occurred when he traveled to Tibet; there he learned vital truths about topics including Yetis. The Church teaches that Yetis exist, and that SubGenius members have descended from them. The only relative of Dobbs that the Church identifies is his mother, Jane McBride Dobbs—Church leaders cite his lack of resemblance to his mother's husband as the reason for not revealing his father. Dobbs is married to a woman named Connie; SubGenius leaders identify the couple as archetypes of the genders in a belief that resembles Hindu doctrines about Shiva and Parvati. Church literature has variously described Dobbs' occupation as [...] "drilling equipment" [...] or fluoride sales, and accounts of his life generally emphasize his good fortune rather than intelligence. SubGenius leaders believe that he is capable of time travel, and that this ability results in occasional changes to doctrine, deemed the [...] "Sacred Doctrine of Erasability" [...] by the Church. Consequently, members attempt to follow Dobbs by eschewing <b>unchangeable</b> plans.|$|E
500|$|Plato {{was called}} by {{biologist}} Ernst Mayr [...] "the great antihero of evolutionism," [...] because he promoted belief in essentialism, which is {{also referred to as}} the theory of Forms. This theory holds that each natural type of object in the observed world is an imperfect manifestation of the ideal, form or [...] "species" [...] which defines that type. In his Timaeus for example, Plato has a character tell a story that the Demiurge created the cosmos and everything in it because, being good, and hence, [...] "...free from jealousy, He desired that all things should be as like Himself as they could be." [...] The creator created all conceivable forms of life, since [...] "...without them the universe will be incomplete, for it will not contain every kind of animal which it ought to contain, {{if it is to be}} perfect." [...] This [...] "principle of plenitude"—the idea that all potential forms of life are essential to a perfect creation—greatly influenced Christian thought. However some historians of science have questioned how much influence Plato's essentialism had on natural philosophy by stating that many philosophers after Plato believed that species might be capable of transformation and that the idea that biologic species were fixed and possessed <b>unchangeable</b> essential characteristics did not become important until the beginning of biological taxonomy in the 17th and 18th centuries.|$|E
500|$|Scholastic philosopher John Duns Scotus {{argued that}} the only moral {{obligations}} that God could not take away from humans are to love God, as God is, definitionally, the most loveable thing[...] Scotus {{argued that the}} natural law, in the strictest sense, contains only what is self-evidently analytically true and that God could not make these statements false. This means that the commands of natural law do not depend on God's will, and thus form the first three commandments of the Ten Commandments. The last seven of the Ten Commandments {{do not belong to}} the natural law in the strictest sense. Whilst our duties to God are self-evident, true by definition, and <b>unchangeable</b> even by God, our duties to others (found on the second tablet) were arbitrarily willed by God and are within his power to revoke and replace (although, the third commandment, to honour the Sabbath and keep it holy, has a little of both, as we are absolutely obliged to render worship to God, but there is no obligation in natural law to do it on this day or that). Scotus does note, however that the last seven commandments [...] "are highly consonant with , though they do not follow necessarily from first practical priciples that are known in virtue of their terms and are necessarily known by any intellect ...|$|E
500|$|In Great Britain, the {{philosophy}} of natural theology remained influential. William Paley's 1802 book Natural Theology with its famous watchmaker analogy had been written {{at least in part}} {{as a response to the}} transmutational ideas of Erasmus Darwin. Geologists influenced by natural theology, such as Buckland and Sedgwick, made a regular practice of attacking the evolutionary ideas of Lamarck, Grant, and Vestiges. Although Charles Lyell opposed scriptural geology, he also believed in the immutability of species, and in his Principles of Geology, he criticized Lamarck's theories of development. Idealists such as Louis Agassiz and Richard Owen believed that each species was fixed and <b>unchangeable</b> because it represented an idea in the mind of the creator. They believed that relationships between species could be discerned from developmental patterns in embryology, as well as in the fossil record, but that these relationships represented an underlying pattern of divine thought, with progressive creation leading to increasing complexity and culminating in humanity. Owen developed the idea of [...] "archetypes" [...] in the Divine mind that would produce a sequence of species related by anatomical homologies, such as vertebrate limbs. Owen led a public campaign that successfully marginalized Grant in the scientific community. Darwin would make good use of the homologies analyzed by Owen in his own theory, but the harsh treatment of Grant, and the controversy surrounding Vestiges, showed him the need to ensure that his own ideas were scientifically sound.|$|E

2500|$|Marx also {{viewed the}} Christian {{doctrine}} {{of original sin}} as being deeply anti-social in character. Original sin, he argued, convinces people {{that the source of}} their misery lies in the inherent and <b>unchangeable</b> [...] "sinfulness" [...] of humanity rather than in the forms of social organization and institutions, which, Marx argued, can be changed through the application of collective social planning.|$|E
2500|$|This {{teaching}} is {{embodied in the}} current canon law 1024) and the Catechism of the Catholic Church (1992), by the canonical statement: [...] "Only a baptized man (Latin: vir) validly receives sacred ordination."

2500|$|The core of {{what they}} called their [...] "Tradition of the Elders" [...] was a belief in an <b>unchangeable,</b> eternal, all-powerful God, creator of heaven and earth, of man, and of woman formed from a rib taken from the man. They {{believed}} in humanity's temptation by a devil, and its fall, and that some day a messiah would come to its rescue. They lived in expectation of a prophecy that white foreigners would bring them a sacred parchment roll.|$|E
2500|$|In 1908, Swiss {{neuroanatomist}} and psychiatrist Auguste Forel {{wrote of}} the phenomenon, proposing that it be {{referred to it as}} [...] "Pederosis", the [...] "Sexual Appetite for Children". Similar to Krafft-Ebing's work, Forel made the distinction between incidental sexual abuse by persons with dementia and other organic brain conditions, and the truly preferential and sometimes exclusive sexual desire for children. However, he disagreed with Krafft-Ebing in that he felt the condition of the latter was largely ingrained and <b>unchangeable.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Create-A-Superstar mode is {{much the}} same as the {{previous}} installments in this series. SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006 adds a few new features, such as new items in the makeup category to give the player's created superstar more realistic facial features (such as wrinkles, a cleft chin, acne, and scars). Also included are new shirts and pants, which while <b>unchangeable</b> in color, look more realistic (as opposed to the [...] "painted on" [...] look of shirts from previous games).|$|E
2500|$|Films may {{resort to}} the notion that romance is a {{solution}} to life's problems or is <b>unchangeable,</b> tapping into a [...] "love conquers all" [...] appeal; for example, in [...] "doomed" [...] romances where the underlying message is that the love the couple shared endured even though their time together was cut short. A film supercouple can be a couple appearing with the same actors over the course of few or several films, making the actors the supercouples rather than the characters.|$|E
2500|$|In this {{negative}} formulation, natural selection only preserves a constant and <b>unchangeable</b> type or essence of created form, by eliminating extreme variations or unfit individuals that deviate {{too far from}} this essence.
