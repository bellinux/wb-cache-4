40|$|The {{accuracy}} {{and range of}} studies on cardiovascular and pulmonary functions can be greatly facilitated if the motions of the underlying organ systems throughout individual cycles can be directly visualized and readily measured with minimum or preferably no effect on these motions. Achievement of this objective requires development of techniques for quantitative noninvasive or minimally invasive dynamic and stop-action imaging of the organ systems. A review of advances in dynamic quantitative imaging of moving organs reveals that the revolutionary value of cross-sectional and three-dimensional images produced by various types of radiant energy such as X-rays and gamma rays, positrons, electrons, protons, light, and ultrasound for clinical diagnostic and biomedical research applications {{is just beginning to}} be realized. The fabrication of a clinically <b>useful</b> <b>cross-section</b> reconstruction device with sensing capabilities for both anatomical structural composition and chemical composition may be possible and awaits future development...|$|E
40|$|This thesis uses a case-study of the {{historical}} development of one Scottish voluntary social work agency - Family Care - as a vehicle for exploring the complex and changing nature of the social work task. I argue that social work is best understood as a discursive formation - that is, a collection of contradictory and competing discourses that come together to frame the task of social work, defining not just its capabilities but also its potential. I argue that there is no essential social work task, but that on the contrary, social work has always been subject to competing claims of definition and practice. It is only therefore by exploring the different discourses within social work that we can begin to understand what social work is and might be today. Family Care, although today a relatively small and specialised voluntary social work agency, offers in its historical development over the last eighty years a <b>useful</b> <b>cross-section</b> of some of the concerns which have been central to the formation of the social work task. The discourses which form the basis of my investigation and analysis are as follows :- vigilance and social purity; Christian ethics and values; professionalism; the "psy" discourse; feminism and familialism; welfare ideologies. I conclude that the very complexity and diversity which is endemic in social work is a cause for optimism. Accepting the limitations and responsibilities which are a necessary part of social work, we should strive to make the social work task as non-oppressive and as just as possible...|$|E
50|$|Resonant Inelastic x-ray Scattering {{processes}} {{are classified as}} either direct or indirect. This distinction is <b>useful</b> because the <b>cross-sections</b> for each are quite different. When direct scattering is allowed, {{it will be the}} dominant scattering channel, with indirect processes contributing only in higher order. In contrast, for the large class of experiments for which direct scattering is forbidden, RIXS relies exclusively on indirect scattering channels.|$|R

We identify an index of international liquidity and, applying techniques borrowed from formal network analysis (in particular, blockmodelling) we produce a formal ranking of currencies according to their degree of international circulation. The resulting indices are powerful tools to study {{the logic of the}} emergence of international currencies, as well as <b>useful</b> controls for <b>cross-section</b> regressions. international monetary system; key currency; networks; pound sterling...|$|R
40|$|Simple model, {{based on}} the {{analytical}} formula for Compton scattering, is {{used to describe the}} realistic photon energy spectra of the Photon Collider at TESLA. Parameters of the model are obtained from the comparison with the full beam simulation by V. Telnov, which includs nonlinear corrections and contributions of higher order processes. Photon energy distribution and polarization, in the high energy part of the spectra, are well reproduced. Model can be used for Monte Carlo simulation of gamma-gamma events at various energies. Parametrization is also shown to be very <b>useful</b> for numerical <b>cross-section</b> calculations. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{builds on}} the labor {{econometrics}} and classical treatment effects literatures to provide a framework supporting causal concepts and methods for estimating effects of natural experiments operating over time in an explicitly dynamic time-series context. We examine conditions {{for the construction of}} covariates instrumental in identifying effects of interest that lead to new tests for unconfoundedness, a key condition for the identification of causal effects that we link to the concept of Granger non-causality. Our new tests for unconfoundedness are <b>useful</b> in both <b>cross-section</b> and dynamic time-series settings.

40|$|Information on year-to-year {{changes in}} the {{characteristics}} of an identical group (or "panel") of taxpayers is a <b>useful</b> supplement to <b>cross-section</b> studies based on recurring samples. This article draws on several sources over the 1978 - 1983 period to suggest the "lifecycle" through which the returns of taxpayers pass over time. For example, 9 percent of the 1983 filings of Form 1040 A were "start-filers," while less than 3 percent of the Forms 1040 were similarly classified. Data also suggest that relatively few taxpayers shift from the 1040 A to the 1040 in the subsequent year if their returns show a small adjusted gross income (AGI) [...] e. g., below $S, 000; but as many as 4...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA new semi-empirical {{parameterization}} for residue {{cross sections}} in spallation reactions is presented. Theprescription named SPACS, for spallation cross sections, permits calculating the fragment production in protonandneutron-induced collisions with light up to heavy non-fissile partners from the Fermi regime to ultrarelativisticenergies. The model is fully analytical, {{based on a}} new parameterization of the mass yields, accountingfor the dependence on bombarding energy. The formalism for the isobaric distribution consists of a commonlyused functional form, borrowed from the empirical parameterization of fragmentation cross sections EPAX,with the observed suited adjustments for spallation, and extended to the charge-pickup channel. Structural andeven-odd staggering related to the last stage of the primary-residue deexcitation process is additionally explicitlyintroduced with a new prescription. Calculations are benchmarked with recent data collected at GSI, Darmstadtas well as with previous measurements employing various techniques. The dependences observed experimentallyon collision energy, reaction-partner mass, and proton-neutron asymmetry are well described. A fast analyticalparameterization, such as SPACS, can be relevant to be implemented in complex simulations as used for practicalissues at nuclear facilities and plants. Its predictive power also makes it <b>useful</b> for <b>cross-section</b> estimates inastrophysics and biophysics...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work was to study the behaviour of antennas constructed using textured surface substrates, and {{to a certain extent}} provide control over their farfield radiation patterns. The properties of the textured surface have been analysed in terms of numerical electromagnetic simulation and by measurement, revealing both artificial magnetic conductor and electromagnetic bandgap properties. It is shown through measurement that by engineering the reflection phase response of such surfaces they can be made to reflect an incident circularly polarised. wave with the same sense as that of the incident polarisation, or with a sense opposite to that of the incident wave. Such properties can be potentially <b>useful</b> in radar <b>cross-section</b> control. Having characterised the textured surface, we then demonstrate its use as an efficient ground plane for a wire dipole. For this structure, we demonstrate that the dipole excites surface currents which, in turn, contribute to the far-field radiation pattern. This is confirmed by the examination of the 'measured near-field and far-field energy distributions close to the antenna. By introducing surface anisotropy to the structure, we further demonstrate far-field radiation pattern control. A novel method of feeding such structures was proposed, using a slot etched in the ground plane, in order to provide excitation to the antenna. Further, we show that careful placement of surface mounted resistors connecting adjacent patches can influence the confinement of surface currents, and as a result produce a more directive radiation pattern. We also show that by selectively interconnecting textured elements, the current distribution can be modified such that we can switch the far-field pattern from sum to difference mode.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Doppler tissue {{echocardiography}} {{and color}} M-mode Doppler flow propagation velocity have proven <b>useful</b> in evaluating <b>cross-sections</b> {{of patients with}} left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, but experience with serial changes is limited. Purpose and methods: We tested their use by evaluating the temporal changes of LV function in a pacing-induced congestive heart failure model. Rapid ventricular pacing was initiated and maintained in 20 dogs for 4 weeks. Echocardiography was performed at baseline and weekly during brief pacing cessation. RESULTS: With rapid pacing, LV volume significantly increased and ejection fraction (57 %- 28 %), stroke volume (37 - 18 mL), and mitral annulus systolic velocity (16. 1 - 6. 6 cm/s) by Doppler tissue echocardiography significantly decreased, with ejection fraction and mitral annulus systolic velocity closely correlated (r = 0. 706, P <. 0001). In contrast to the mitral inflow velocities, mitral annulus early diastolic velocity decreased steadily (12. 3 - 7. 3 cm/s) resulting in a dramatic decrease in mitral annulus early/late (1. 22 - 0. 57) diastolic velocity with no tendency toward pseudonormalization. The color M-mode Doppler flow propagation velocity also showed significant steady decrease (57 - 24 cm/s) throughout the pacing period. Multiple regression analysis chose mitral annulus systolic velocity (r = 0. 895, P <. 0001) and propagation velocity (r = 0. 782, P <. 0001) for {{the most important factor}} predicting LV systolic and diastolic function, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Doppler tissue echocardiography and color M-mode Doppler flow could evaluate the serial deterioration in LV dysfunction throughout the pacing period. These were more useful in quantifying progressive LV dysfunction than conventional ehocardiographic techniques, and were probably relatively independent of preload. These techniques could be suitable for longitudinal evaluation in addition to the cross-sectional study...|$|R
