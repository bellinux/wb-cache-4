40|$|When blindfolded {{subjects}} {{match the}} position of their forearms in the vertical plane they rely on signals coming from the periphery {{as well as from}} the central motor command. The command signal provides a positional cue from the accompanying effort sensation required to hold the arm against gravity. Here we have asked, does a centrally generated effort signal contribute to position sense in the horizontal plane, where gravity cannot play a role? Blindfolded subjects were required to match forearm position for the <b>unloaded</b> <b>arm</b> and when flexors or extensors were bearing 10 %, 25 % or 40 % of maximum loads. Before each match the reference arm was conditioned by contracting elbow muscles while the arm was held flexed or extended. For the <b>unloaded</b> <b>arm</b> conditioning led to a consistent pattern of errors which was attributed to signals from flexor and extensor muscle spindles. When elbow muscles were loaded the errors from conditioning converged, presumably because the spindles had become coactivated through the fusimotor system during the load-bearing contraction. However, this convergence was seen only when subjects supported a static load. When they moved the load differences in errors from conditioning persisted. Muscle vibration during load bearing or moving a load did not alter the distribution of errors. It is concluded that for position sense of an <b>unloaded</b> <b>arm</b> in the horizontal plane the brain relies on signals from muscle spindles. When the arm is loaded, an additional signal of central origin contributes, but only if the load is moved...|$|R

40|$|Background. Arm {{support to}} help {{compensate}} {{for the effects of}} gravity may improve functional use of the shoulder and elbow during therapy after stroke, but gravity compensation may alter motor control. Objective. To obtain quantitative information on how gravity compensation influences muscle activation patterns during functional, 3 -dimensional reaching movements. Methods. Eight patients with mild hemiparesis performed 2 sets of repeated reach and retrieval movements, with and without <b>unloading</b> the <b>arm,</b> using a device that acted at the elbow and forearm to compensate for gravity. Electromyographic (EMG) patterns of 6 upper extremity muscles were compared during elbow and shoulder joint excursions with and without gravity compensation. Results. Movement performance was similar with and without gravity compensation. Smooth rectified EMG (SRE) values were decreased from 25 % to 50 % during movements with gravity compensation in 5 out of 6 muscles. The variation of SRE values across movement phases did not differ across conditions. Conclusions. Gravity compensation did not affect general patterns of muscle activation in this sample of stroke patients, probably since they had adequate function to complete the task without arm support. Gravity compensation did facilitate active arm movement excursions without impairing motor control. Gravity compensation may be a valuable modality in conventional or robot-aided therapy to increase the intensity of training for mildly impaired patients...|$|R
40|$|Objectives—To {{determine}} the intrarater reliability and precision of lumbar multifidus and transversus abdominis thickness measurements using freehand sonography {{in a range}} of static and dynamic conditions. Methods—Fifteen asymptomatic participants performed a range of exercises while sonography was used to measure absolute muscle thickness and changes in muscle thickness from rest. Exercise conditions included the abdominal drawing-in maneuver, active straight leg raise, contralateral <b>arm</b> lift, both <b>unloaded</b> and loaded, treadmill walking, and using the Functional Readaptive Exercise Device. Intraday and interday reliability was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficients, and the standard error of measurement was used to assess measurement precision. Results—Good to excellent reliability was achieved for absolute transversus abdominis and lumbar multifidus thickness in all conditions. Measurement precision for absolute lumbar multifidus thickness was � 2. 8 mm for the <b>unloaded</b> contralateral <b>arm</b> lift, � 1. 8 mm for the loaded contralateral arm lift, � 3. 1 mm for treadmill walking, and � 3. 8 mm for the Functional Readaptive Exercise Device; for absolute transversus abdominis thickness, precision was � 0. 6 mm for the abdominal drawing-in maneuver, � 0. 5 mm for the active straight leg raise, � 0. 7 mm for treadmill walking, and � 0. 5 mm for the Functional Readaptive Exercise Device.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to apply the {{computational}} approach to motor learning, i. e., describe the constraints that enable performance improvement with experience and also the constraints that must be satisfied by a motor learning system, describe what is being computed {{in order to achieve}} learning, and why it is being computed. The particular tasks used to assess motor learning are loaded and <b>unloaded</b> free <b>arm</b> movement, and the thesis includes work on rigid body load estimation, arm model estimation, optimal filtering for model parameter estimation, and trajectory learning from practice. Learning algorithms have been developed and implemented in the context of robot arm control. The thesis demonstrates some of the roles of knowledge in learning. Powerful generalizations can be {{made on the basis of}} knowledge of system structure, as is demonstrated in the load and arm model estimation algorithms. Improving the performance of parameter estimation algorithms used in learning involves knowledge of the measurement noise characteristics, as is shown in the derivation of optimal filters. Using trajectory errors to correct commands requires knowledge of how command errors are transformed into performance errors, i. e., an accurate model of the dynamics of the controlled system, as is demonstrated in the trajectory learning work. The performance demonstrated by the algorithms developed in this thesis should be compared with algorithms that use less knowledge, such as table based schemes to learn arm dynamics, previous single trajectory learning algorithms, and much of traditional adaptive control...|$|R
40|$|AIM: This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} and compare the physiological, cognitive and cardiovascular responses during explosives ordnance disposal (EOD) type activity in moderate and hot environments whilst wearing an EOD suit and phase change material cooling garments on either the head or torso. METHODS: Following ethical approval from Coventry University’s Ethical Committee, and after providing informed consent, six healthy, unacclimatised males {{took part in the}} study (age: 23 (3) yrs; height: 1. 74 (0. 05) m; mass: 65. 1 (2. 0) kg). Each participant underwent 9 sessions performed on separate days consisting of; three pre-trial practice sessions (no EOD suit worn), one trial familiarisation session (light-weight EOD suit worn) and six experimental sessions (consisting of 6 experimental trials; light-weight EOD suit worn), with a week separating the familiarisation and each experimental session. The experimental trials involved six separate conditions, two without cooling (20 NC and 40 NC), two with head cooling (20 HC and 40 HC) and two with torso cooling (20 TC and 40 TC) performed at 20 °C and 40 °C. Conditions were applied in a randomised cross-over type design. Cooling consisted of a phase change material (PCM) scrum cap (head cooling) and PCM vest (torso cooling) donned by the participant prior to wearing a light-weight 3010 Ergotec EOD suit 15 minutes before each trial. Each trial consisted of 6 activity stations; 1. Treadmill walking (4 km·hr- 1); 2. Manual loading; 3. Searching and crawling; 4. The postural challenge; 5. <b>Unloaded</b> <b>arm</b> ergometry (60 rev·min- 1); 6. The spatial working memory (SWM) test, performed 4 times through to make up 4 cycles lasting a total of 80 minutes per trial. IV RESULTS: There was an increase in physiological, perceptual and cardiovascular strain with duration in all conditions. Physiological strain was greater in 40 °C air than in 20 °C air (p< 0. 001). The heart rate (HR), core temperature (TcP), skin temperature (Tsk), chest temperature (Tc), rate of percieved exertion (RPE), thermal sensation (ThS) and thermal comfort (ThC) responses (excluding Tf) were lowest during the 20 TC trial when compared to 20 HC and 20 NC. At 40 °C, the physiological strain was reduced with both cooling condidions (40 HC and 40 TC). During 40 HC, TcP, Tf, and PhSI, were lowest for upto 60 minutes of activity (3 cycles) when compared to 40 NC. 40 TC produced the lowest Tsk responses for up to 60 minutes of activity (3 cycles) and Tc responses throughout the 80 minute trial, compared to 40 NC and 40 HC. The recovery of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was not comprimised in response to standing at 40 °C, however during both cooling trials within the first cycle at 20 °C MAP did not recover back to the pre-stand reponse. At 40 °C, HR peaked significantly post-stand and remained greater than that during the prestand response. Completion speed of the cognitive spatial working memory test was greatest during the final cycle of activity, (p< 0. 017). CONCLUSION: At 20 °C torso cooling created the most benefit when compared to head cooling at reducing the physiological and perceptual strain experienced. At 40 °C, both cooling methods (TC and HC) were effective at lowering the physiological, perceptual and cardiovascular strain when compared to the non-cooling control (40 NC). The majority of this benefit was observed within the first hour of activity. It is recommended that the torso cooling garment be used within the light-weight EOD suit to reduce the thermal strain experienced at 40 °C, and that when using the light-weight EOD suit at 20 °C the PCM cooling garments are not required as the physiological strain experienced at this temperature is less than that experienced at 40 °...|$|R
40|$|Objective. Fibromyalgia (FM) is a {{disorder}} characterised by chronic widespreadpain in soft tissues, especially in muscles. Previous research has demonstrateda higher muscle fibre conduction velocity (CV) in painful muscles of FM patients. The {{primary goal of}} this study was to investigate whether there is also a difference in CV in non-painful, non-tender point (TP) related muscles between FM patients and controls. The secondary goal was to explore associations between the CV, the number of TPs and the complaints in FM. Methods. Surface electromyography (sEMG) was performed on the biceps brachii muscle of female FM patients (13) and matched healthy controls (13). Short static contractions were applied with the <b>arm</b> <b>unloaded</b> and loaded at 5 % and 10 % of maximum voluntary force. The CV was derived by cross-correlation method (CV-cc) and inter-peak latency method (CV-ipl). TP score and Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) were performed in all participants. Correlations were calculated between the CVs, TP score and items of the FIQ. Results. In FM patients, the CV was higher than in the controls (CV-cc p= 0. 005; CV-ipl p= 0. 022). The CV was correlated with the number of TPs in FM patients (r= 0. 642 and 0. 672 for CVcc and CV-ipl, respectively). No correlations were found between the CV and any aspect of health status on the FIQ. Conclusion. The results demonstrate abnormally high muscle membrane conduction velocity in FM, even in non-TP muscles. In addition, a relationship has been found between the high membrane velocity and the number of TPs...|$|R
