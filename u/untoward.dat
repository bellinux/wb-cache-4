5|$|During {{the evening}} of the 10 February 1942 the German {{flotilla}} prepared to undertake their operation. As they slipped anchor RAF bombers appeared over head. The German ships conducted a u-turn and sped back to the dock. The RAF bombers released their bombs but did little damage. Fortunately they did not notice anything <b>untoward.</b>|$|E
5|$|I {{understand}} {{there is a}} clerkship vacant in your office, and I beg {{to apply for the}} same. I have passed the Matriculation Examination and studied up to the F.A. but was prevented from pursuing my studies further owing to several <b>untoward</b> circumstances. I have, however, been devoting all my time to Mathematics and developing the subject. I can say I am quite confident I can do justice to my work if I am appointed to the post. I therefore beg to request that you will be good enough to confer the appointment on me.|$|E
5|$|After {{its season}} in London the company {{performed}} in Vienna, Budapest, Prague and Berlin. The tour was successful, artistically and financially, {{but was not}} without <b>untoward</b> incident. A planned visit to St Petersburg had to be cancelled because the Narodny Dom theatre burned down, and in Vienna the Philharmonic was unequal to the difficulties of the score of Petrushka. The illustrious orchestra revolted at the rehearsal for the first performance, refusing to play for Monteux; only an intervention by Diaghilev restored the rehearsal, {{by the end of}} which Monteux was applauded and Stravinsky given an ovation. In the middle of the tour Monteux was briefly summoned back to Paris by the Concerts Colonne, which had the contractual right to recall him, to deputise for Pierné; his own deputy, Désiré-Émile Inghelbrecht, took temporary musical charge of the Ballets Russes.|$|E
5|$|The three Britons {{were brought}} to trial on 6 April 1826. Lehuby, still in the Netherlands, was tried in absentia. The Crown prosecution's case was seriously {{hampered}} by his absence, particularly because many key documents were {{with him in the}} Netherlands. The prosecutor alleged a complex conspiracy between MacGregor, Lehuby and their associates to profit personally from a fraudulent land concession and loan prospectus. MacGregor's lawyer, a Frenchman called Merilhou, asserted that if anything <b>untoward</b> had occurred, the missing managing director should be held culpable; there was no proof of a conspiracy, he said, and MacGregor could have been himself defrauded by Lehuby. The prosecutor conceded that there was insufficient evidence to prove his case, complimented MacGregor for co-operating with the investigation fairly and openly, and withdrew the charges. The three judges confirmed the defendants' release—"a full and perfect acquittal", Hippisley would write—but days later the French authorities succeeded in having Lehuby extradited, and the three men learned they would have to stand trial again.|$|E
25|$|Sulfonamides {{have the}} {{potential}} to cause a variety of <b>untoward</b> reactions, including urinary tract disorders, haemopoietic disorders, porphyria, and hypersensitivity reactions. When used in large doses, they may cause a strong allergic reaction. Two of the most serious are Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (also known as Lyell syndrome).|$|E
25|$|At Wimbledon Odesnik {{lost his}} first round match to 30th-ranked Jürgen Melzer. The match {{generated}} some media attention {{as a consequence}} of the patterns of pre-match betting on the result, with the online betting exchange Betfair reporting that unusually large sums for a low-profile match were wagered on the straight sets scoreline. Officials at Betfair did not suspect anything <b>untoward,</b> noting that an announcement had been made on TV shortly before the match that Odesnik was injured.|$|E
25|$|When Bond flies the new Gilbert XF-120 fighter, {{he finds}} {{dangerous}} structural problems that threaten its imminent acceptance by the Air Force. However, nobody really believes {{his claim that}} he did not subject the fighter prototype to stresses beyond its design specifications, especially H. G. Gilbert (Ralph Moody), the head of the company that built the fighter. When the general tries to replicate Bond's maneuvers, nothing <b>untoward</b> happens. Afterward, Bond sees Banner nearly collapse in the locker room, but Banner shrugs off the incident.|$|E
25|$|In {{view of the}} Jallianwala Bagh Massacre of 13 April 1919, almost entire Punjab {{was placed}} under martial law {{including}} Lyallpur. There were no <b>untoward</b> incidents except destruction of telephone and telegraph wires near Lyallpur Railway Station. But a huge mass of dry husk near the station caught fire {{and as a result}} 2-3 people burnt alive. It was a coincidence that Lyallpuri was on the station at the moment. Early morning on 22 April, English police fully loaded with machine-guns laid siege to Lyallpur and arrested 12 people including Lyallpuri.|$|E
25|$|Adamson {{records that}} a fox {{lived in a}} tree in the old garden at Rowallan. This fox would watch the world go by from its perch and was {{sufficiently}} savvy {{to leave the house}} keepers chickens alone. One day this fox encountered the local hunt and ran to cover in the tree, to the amazement and consternation of the hunters and hounds. The housekeeper dislodged the poor animal, however it escaped the hunt and was back in its tree the following day as if nothing <b>untoward</b> had happened.|$|E
25|$|On {{his first}} tour abroad to England in 1986, he was {{involved}} in a rare incident when 12 fielders were on the field for one full over from Ravi Shastri in the second test against England at Leeds, when as a substitute for K. Srikkanth, he remained on the field even though Srikkanth had already arrived on the field quietly, without requesting Raman Lamba {{to go back to the}} pavilion. The umpires were also unaware of Srikkanth's return to the field throughout the 6-ball over in which, fortunately, nothing <b>untoward</b> took place on the field.|$|E
25|$|Robert Koch {{developed}} tuberculin in 1890. Inoculated into {{individuals who}} have had tuberculosis, it produces a hypersensitivity reaction, and is still used to detect {{those who have been}} infected. However, Koch used tuberculin as a vaccine. This caused serious reactions and deaths in individuals whose latent tuberculosis was reactivated by the tuberculin. This was a major setback for supporters of new vaccines. Such incidents and others ensured that any <b>untoward</b> results concerning vaccination and related procedures received continued publicity, which grew as the number of new procedures increased.|$|E
25|$|Excessive {{doses of}} escitalopram usually cause {{relatively}} minor <b>untoward</b> effects such as agitation and tachycardia. However, dyskinesia, hypertonia, and clonus may occur in some cases. Plasma escitalopram concentrations are {{usually in a}} range of 20–80 μg/L in therapeutic situations and may reach 80–200 μg/L in the elderly, patients with hepatic dysfunction, those who are poor CYP2C19 metabolizers or following acute overdose. Monitoring of the drug in plasma or serum is generally accomplished using chromatographic methods. Chiral techniques are available to distinguish escitalopram from its racemate, citalopram. Escitalopram seems to be less dangerous than citalopram in overdose and comparable to other SSRIs.|$|E
25|$|After several months, Chikatilo {{found a job}} as a {{communications}} engineer in a town located north of Rostov-on-Don. He relocated to Russia in 1961, renting a small apartment close to his workplace. The same year, his younger sister, Tatyana, finished her schooling and moved into his apartment (his parents would relocate to the Rostov-on-Don region shortly thereafter). Tatyana lived with her brother for six months before marrying a local youth and moving into her in-laws' home; she noted nothing <b>untoward</b> with regard to her brother's lifestyle, except his chronic shyness around women, and resolved to help her brother find a wife and start a family.|$|E
25|$|Colour Bearers {{get their}} name from {{a band of}} purple they wear as {{insignia}} on their uniform, purple {{being one of the}} school colours. They are elected by the pupils and the staff, similar to Eton's Pop, and have important roles in the school community as a whole. Unlike captains they keep their positions for a whole year unless they are demoted which is usually the punishment for <b>untoward</b> behaviour. They meet every week with the Headmaster to attend {{to a wide range of}} school matters. As well as this they are responsible for maintaining the refectory and the library and for serving drinks behind the bar at the weekly socials in addition to organising major school wide events that take place throughout the year.|$|E
25|$|Although Amanullah {{continued}} to profess {{that he had}} no <b>untoward</b> intentions, Roos-Keppel decided that it was prudent to continue the advance and ordered the army to pursue the Afghans across the border. On 13 May British and Indian troops seized control of the western Khyber without opposition and occupied Dacca, however, the British camp was poorly sited for defence and as a consequence they came under an intense long-range artillery barrage from Afghan artillery before Amanullah launched an infantry assault on them. This assault was defeated and the British launched a counter-attack the following day, however, they were unable to consolidate their position and as a result it was not until 17 May that the area was secured and the Afghans withdrew.|$|E
25|$|Sayre's {{biography}} of Franklin contains a story {{alleging that the}} photograph 51 in question was shown to Watson by Wilkins without Franklin's permission, and that this constituted a case of bad science ethics. Others dispute this story, asserting that Wilkins had been given photograph 51 by Franklin's Ph.D. student Gosling because she was leaving King's to work at Birkbeck, and there was allegedly nothing <b>untoward</b> in this transfer of data to Wilkins because Director Randall had insisted that all DNA work belonged exclusively to King's and had instructed Franklin {{in a letter to}} even stop working on it and submit her data. Also, it was implied by Horace Freeland Judson, that Maurice Wilkins had taken the photograph out of Franklin's drawer, but this is also said to be incorrect.|$|E
25|$|The pastel {{shades of}} {{turquoise}} have endeared it to many great cultures of antiquity: it has adorned {{the rulers of}} Ancient Egypt, the Aztecs (and possibly other Pre-Columbian Mesoamericans), Persia, Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, {{and to some extent}} in ancient China since at least the Shang Dynasty. Despite being one of the oldest gems, probably first introduced to Europe (through Turkey) with other Silk Road novelties, turquoise did not become important as an ornamental stone in the West until the 14th century, following a decline in the Roman Catholic Church's influence which allowed the use of turquoise in secular jewellery. It was apparently unknown in India until the Mughal period, and unknown in Japan until the 18th century. A common belief shared by many of these civilizations held that turquoise possessed certain prophylactic qualities; it was thought to change colour with the wearer's health and protect him or her from <b>untoward</b> forces.|$|E
25|$|Some see spam-blocking tools as {{a threat}} to free expression—and laws against {{spamming}} as an <b>untoward</b> precedent for regulation or taxation of e-mail and the Internet at large. Even though it is possible in some jurisdictions to treat some spam as unlawful merely by applying existing laws against trespass and conversion, some laws specifically targeting spam have been proposed. In 2004, United States passed the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 that provided ISPs with tools to combat spam. This act allowed Yahoo! to successfully sue Eric Head, reportedly one of the biggest spammers in the World, who settled the lawsuit for several thousand U.S. dollars in June 2004. But the law is criticized by many for not being effective enough. Indeed, the law was supported by some spammers and organizations that support spamming, and opposed by many in the anti-spam community. Examples of effective anti-abuse laws that respect free speech rights include those in the U.S. against unsolicited faxes and phone calls, and those in Australia and a few U.S. states against spam.|$|E
25|$|Unit Gempur Marin (UNGERIN) (Marine Combat Unit) was {{established}} in 2006 and it was fully operational {{by the end of}} 2007 with the first name as the Unit Selam Tempur due to the pressing need to suppress the pirate attacks alongside the coastal area of Malacca Straits and open sea area of South China Sea which were continuously widespread from time to time despite various efforts done to overcome the problem. The members received special training from the United States after realising the need to form a special unit to secure the national waters and riverine fronts from any <b>untoward</b> incidents. This unit is placed under formation Marine Police Branch which is based in the Marine Police Base at Kampung Aceh, Sitiawan, Perak and Lahad Datu, Sabah. It has a big role in handling threats from pirates, robbery, kidnapping and hijacking of ships and terrorist attacks in national waters. The 30 members of UNGERIN are trained by instructors from US Navy SEALs and US Coast Guard in Langkawi and Kota Kinabalu and are armed with special weaponry, such as Glock 19, MP5 and Colt M4A1 (possibly supported by the United States) and utilise maritime anti-terrorist tactics employed by the units of United States Navy commandos. For the unit's restructuring, the name of UST was changed to Unit Gempur Marin or UNGERIN in the year 2008. Its eventual goal is to have 200 operators on standby with UNGERIN.|$|E
25|$|Ponting was {{announced}} as long-term vice-captain {{in place of}} Adam Gilchrist for Australia's away series in the Caribbean starting in April 2003. The first Test {{was not the first}} time Ponting had been vice-captain of the Australian Test team however, as he was thrust into the role against the West Indies in 2000 and England in 2001—because of injuries to Steve Waugh. Although Gilchrist had not done anything <b>untoward,</b> Ponting was elevated because Australian selectors wanted him to captain if Waugh was to be injured. This was Ponting's third tour to the Caribbean, and he was rested from the only warm-up match ahead of the Tests. Nevertheless, he continued his World Cup form in the First Test, scoring 117 and 42 not out on a slow and low pitch, as Australia won by nine wickets. Ponting scored his first double century (206) in the Second Test, as he and Darren Lehmann shared an Australian third-wicket partnership record of 315 against a weak bowling attack. Australia defeated the West Indies by 118 runs on the final day—retaining the Frank Worrell Trophy. The Tasmanian's rich vein of form continued in the Third Test, after being rested for a tour match against Barbados. He scored 113 before running himself out, as Australia batted first on a pitch at the Kensington Oval described as the slowest Waugh had played on. Waugh's men proceeded to take a 3–0 series, with a comfortable nine-wicket victory. Ponting missed the final Test, as Australia conceded the Test record run chase of 418; nevertheless, Ponting was still awarded the man-of-the-series award, after ending the series with 523 runs at 130.75.|$|E
25|$|As {{with most}} European standards, {{compliance}} by the member {{countries of the}} European Union is purely voluntary, and to be determined {{at the level of}} the member country, usually by means of legislation, or by its own standards organization. To illustrate, this standard, which has been accepted by the United Kingdom, is known locally as BS EN 1789:2007, with the 'BS' referring to British Standards. As a result, the adoption of this standard has varied considerably from one country to another. Most countries, for example, have adopted the sections dealing with vehicle design and performance, while only a few (the UK, Ireland, and Sweden at this writing), have fully adopted the colour, warning system, and livery schemes for such vehicles. To further complicate matters, some countries have adopted some portion of the visual identity standards, but not all. In the Netherlands, Belgium, and some parts of Germany, the conversion to the basic identifying colour (yellow) is occurring, but the balance of visual identity provisions are not. In addition, some countries which are not currently members of the European Union, such as Norway are adopting some portions of the standards, primarily because few other good standards exist for this purpose, particularly those that reflect European realities. The rate and degree of compliance with the standard is a conscious choice by individual countries, while in others, compliance is a matter of the priorities for the changing of older, country specific, legislation. As previously stated, compliance with the standard is purely voluntary. There are no <b>untoward</b> financial implications to compliance, since only ambulances purchased after ratification of the standard by each country are required to be compliant. There is no mandatory provision for the retrofitting of existing ambulances.|$|E
25|$|Scene Three {{takes place}} on a Saturday. A hoedown-themed wedding {{reception}} has been organized at Dino's Diner. People are dressed in their party best, dancing and taking photographs. But {{in the midst of}} the jollity there is an ominous mood. Both Lana and Angelo try to get close to Luca, not realizing that the two of them have each slept with him, while Dino develops an odd sense that something <b>untoward</b> is happening, with Luca at its center. Rita continues to pine after Angelo, but he ignores her. Smarting from Dino's attempts to assert dominance over the proceedings and especially his wife, Lana and Luca sneak off from the party for a dalliance in the garage. They are caught by Dino, who gets into a fight with Luca. Lana tries to intervene but is punched in the stomach by Dino. Luca lunges at Dino but Dino pushes him to the ground. Then Lana picks up a heavy spanner and hits Dino on the head with it. He is stunned by the blow. Lana prevails upon Luca to finish Dino off, and Luca, despite some momentary reluctance, clubs Dino one last time. Dino falls to the ground, apparently dead. Luca and Lana hear someone coming, so they drag Dino's body into his office. Unknown to them, Rita has witnessed the last part of the fight, and she hurries off to call the police. Then Angelo appears, seeking Luca. To Luca and Lana's horror, Dino is not dead – he crawls out of the office and grabs Angelo, seeking help. He then collapses on Angelo, smearing him with his blood. The commotion by Angelo and Dino causes the partygoers to run into the garage. Luca flees before the local cop, Chuck, arrives on the scene. Lana claims that Angelo murdered Dino, and pretends to cry over his dead body. Angelo, realizing his predicament too late and protesting his innocence, is arrested and taken away.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Harold's sister, Hester, {{comes to}} Walford {{to visit and}} tells him that her son, David Samuels (Christopher Reich), is {{interested}} in joining him in Britain. As David is a doctor in Israel, Harold thinks {{it is a great}} idea and in April that year, David joins him in Walford and is made a partner in the practice. Harold even moves back to Walford and he and David live in the flat above the surgery. Despite being extremely fond of each other, the new partners argue about almost everything. David wants to modernize the surgery and bring in computers but Harold is set in his ways and is opposed to any obvious changes. Harold also disagrees with David's friendship with their secretary, Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully), particularly when the two get drunk at a Christmas party, leave together and share the same bed. David awakes the next day not remembering a thing, but is reassured when Michelle informs him that he had been too drunk to do anything <b>untoward</b> anyway. Harold is not convinced however and berates David for the degradation he brought upon himself and the surgery. Later, David and Harold fall out over Harold's treatment of patients when he discovers that Colin Russell (Michael Cashman), is showing early symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis. He decides not to tell Colin as worrying about his condition could bring on another attack although Colin may not have another attack for 20 years or so, choosing instead to tell Colin that he is overworked and anemic. This highly unethical move appalls David but despite this, Harold continues to refuse to tell Colin about his illness. However, in January 1989, he finally tells Colin the truth. Colin is furious that Harold had kept this information from him and refuses to listen when he tries to explain his reasons. He threatens to report Dr Legg to the authorities and is mortified at how unethical he has been. Although Dr Legg is sorry, he stands by his decision to lie, feeling that Colin benefited from not knowing - when in fact, the opposite is true.|$|E

After the police raided the flat looking for drugs, the landlord of the property sought an injunction against Starr {{to prevent it from}} being used for anything <b>untoward</b> or illegal. Starr sold the lease in February1969. In 2010, Ono unveiled a blue marker plaque at the site, making it an English Heritage [...] "building of historical interest".|$|E

"In her 'Judas' video, Lady Gaga plays {{fast and}} loose with Catholic iconography, and generates several <b>untoward</b> statements, but she {{typically}} dances on the line without going over it. The faux-baptismal scene is a curious inclusion, as is her apparent fondness for the Jesus character. But if anyone thinks the Catholic League is going to go ballistic over Lady Gaga's latest contribution, they haven't a clue about what really constitutes anti-Catholicism. The video is a mess, incoherent, it leaves the viewer more perplexed than moved." ...|$|E

[...] The United States considered this area {{to be part of the}} Oregon Country and hoped to eventually gain control of it. [...] The second was possible European threats against the Latin American nations, newly independent from Spain.
