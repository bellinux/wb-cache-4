5|$|The Anglo-American {{immigrants}} {{residing in}} newly-independent Texas overwhelmingly desired immediate annexation by the United States.

Jackson's political caution was informed by northern concerns that Texas could potentially form several new slave states and undermine the North-South balance in Congress.|$|E
5|$|The Second Doctor {{was portrayed}} by Patrick Troughton, whose serials were more action-oriented {{than those of}} his predecessor. Additionally, after The Highlanders, stories {{moved away from the}} purely {{historical}} ones that featured during William Hartnell's tenure; instead, any historical tales also included a science fiction element. Patrick Troughton retained the role <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> episode of The War Games when members of the Doctor's race, the Time Lords, put him on trial for breaking the laws of time and forced him to regenerate.|$|E
5|$|The expedition's {{success was}} widely applauded, though {{the story of}} Scott's heroic failure overshadowed its {{achievement}} in the United Kingdom.

Recent polar historians have more fully recognised the skill and courage of Amundsen's party; the permanent scientific base at the pole bears his name, together with that of Scott.|$|E

5|$|The {{manor house}} of Westleigh was at Higher Hall and existed in Richard I's time (1189–1199).

5|$|The most noted of Bauer's {{pictures}} are his watercolors, the technique he used when illustrating for books and magazines; he alternated between aquarelle and gouache. When he created illustrations the two mediums were sometimes mixed, since he needed both {{the speed of}} the aquarelle and the contrast and impasto that the gouache provided. These water-soluble, and fast drying, media allowed Bauer to work on his pictures <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> minute before deadline, something he was prone to do.|$|E
