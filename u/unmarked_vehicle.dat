2500|$|On April 1, 1989, Mexican state {{authorities}} were stationed at a routine checkpoint near Santa Elena {{when they saw}} a vehicle that ran through the checkpoint without stopping. [...] The vehicle had crossed the international border from Texas and sped through Mexican Federal Highway 2, which connects Matamoros and Reynosa, Tamaulipas. The man driving the vehicle was Serafín, who had kidnapped Kilroy weeks earlier. Instead of turning on their police sirens, the police decided to follow the truck using an <b>unmarked</b> <b>vehicle.</b> They were then led to the ranch and pulled off at a distance. After about 30 minutes, Serafín took off from the ranch {{and headed back to}} the city. The officers decided to make their move to the ranch.

Instead of arresting Serafín, the police decided to continue gathering more evidences on the suspected criminal activities at the ranch and the organized crime members involved with the Hernández family. They used informants in Matamoros to inquire on what the family was up to at Santa Elena {{in order to make a}} series of crucial arrests.|$|E
2500|$|As of 2015, the {{department}} uses {{a large number}} of Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors as their main fleet of patrol vehicles which was first ordered in 1996 replacing the Chevrolet Caprice 9C1 (used between 1988 and in patrol service until 2004 (replacing the Ford LTD Crown Victoria squads to 1987 along with M-bodied Mopars (primarily the Plymouth Gran Fury (both R and M platform) last used in 1989)). They have Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor models from dating from 1999 to 2011. Since Ford no longer produces the [...] "crown Vic" [...] (procurement of the Crown Vic ended in April 2011 when the orders were filled), The department has chosen to phase in the Chevy Tahoe PPV and Ford Police Interceptor Utility(Explorer) as the successor to the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor. The department is continuing to test new Chevy Caprice PPV models and Ford Taurus Interceptors (including the fifth-generation Explorer) as well - the test mules as of 2015 have been integrated into the mainstream vehicle fleet. [...] It also uses pickup trucks from the Big Three, such as the Chevrolet Colorado, Ford F150, and Dodge Ram for their Truck Enforcement Unit. There is also a small fleet of Dodge Chargers and Chevrolet Camaro s, which are mainly used as [...] "stealth traffic patrol vehicles" [...] (which is part of the Traffic Enforcement division). The stealth vehicles are plain white police cars with a slicktop roof and gray, reflective [...] "HOUSTON POLICE" [...] graphics on the side {{as well as on the}} front bumper, and hidden emergency lights that are driven by uniformed officers. The Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor is also used in this manner - as of late 2011 the stealth patrol vehicles are now painted black. The stealth squads have been supplemented with 14 Ford Taurus Police Interceptors in early 2014 (painted black). Solo (motorcycle) officers use Harley-Davidson motorcycles. [...] The patrol vehicle livery, painted white with blue lettered graphics dating back to 1999 (which replaced the Columbia Blue livery last used in 1998 and retired a decade later), is being phased out for a black and white color scheme where 100 vehicles are painted from $60,000 earmarked from asset forfeiture funds (under HPD policy the previous livery is still used in service until official retirement). HPD squads are usually retired when the vehicle reaches 100,000 miles (they are not reassigned to reserve or secondary duty as with the Austin or San Antonio PD after 80,000 miles) - some squads dating over 10 model years old which are no longer used for patrol duty are usually reassigned either as bait squads (HPD will park an unmanned squad in a high crime area or illegal dumping site) or the Mobility Response Division - the older HPD fleet used by Mobility Response have been retired and replaced with Ford F150 extended cab pickup trucks from the Truck Enforcement Unit. Around 2016 the Houston Chronicle revealed that some of the older squads are still in service but the breakdown rate has increased - a 100,000 mile marked squad (or 120,000 mile <b>unmarked</b> <b>vehicle)</b> has the life expectancy of an automobile with 300,000 miles with regular maintenance. At the time HPD ordered 50 new Ford Police Interceptor Utilities for the command staff but not the mainstream vehicle fleet ({{the department}} has procured newer vehicles but the budget crunch has taken in a few new orders whilst the older squads are still operational. A budget crunch in major Texas cities is partly to blame where municipal budgets are usually slashed including priority spending for first responders. Most modern HPD Patrol cars today are Blue and white saying [...] " [...] HOUSTON POLICE" [...] on the side.Newer models use a mixture of black and white paint now with 911 EMERGENCY listed on the rear side of the car or truck.|$|E

[...] Four years later, Judge Gonzales heard another disputed election case, Dumas v.

[...] As in the Fitzmorris case, Gonzales ruled that Dumas had not proved his case of election fraud and ordered the payment of court costs and legal fees to Jetson. Coincidentally, Jetson died shortly after taking his oath of office as a state representative. In another case, Malina v. Gonzales, the judge, while on the 19th Judicial District Court, was himself sued in 1988 regarding a highway incident with Thomas Martin Malina (born June 1957) of Baton Rouge. Malina signaled Judge Gonzales, not knowing his identity, for allegedly driving at a slower rate in the [...] "fast lane" [...] of a highway and motioned for the driver to move into the left lane. Gonzales apparently became irritated at Malina and turned on his flashing light and told Malina that he had the authority to arrest him, but Malina fled the scene. Judge Gonzales then sent a police officer privately to Malina's home to request that Malina appear the next day in court. Gonzales told Malina that he had arrest authority and charged him with multiple counts, [...] "fleeing to allude," [...] "resisting an officer," [...] "public endangerment," [...] "disobeying an officer," [...] "reckless driving," [...] and [...] "leaving the scene." [...] Malina said that he questioned the flashing light from an <b>unmarked</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Gonzales cited Malina for contempt of court. Malina was handcuffed, fingerprinted, photographed, and jailed for five hours. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans held on appeal in 1993 that Judge Gonzales lacked legal authority to arrest Malina but did have qualified immunity from Malina's suit and the legal power to charge Malina with contempt and to hold him for five hours.|$|E

Silvar responded that she was working as a prostitute, recognized the detective from a previous solicitation arrest, and decided not to proceed. The detective arrested Silvar and she was charged with loitering for the purpose of prostitution in violation of CCO 12. 08. 30 which states: It is unlawful for any person to loiter in or near any public place or thoroughfare in a manner and under circumstances manifesting the purpose of inducing, enticing, soliciting for or procuring another to commit an act of prostitution. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such purpose is manifested are that such person repeatedly beckons to, stops, attempts to stop or engages persons passing by in conversation, or repeatedly stops or attempts to stop motor vehicle operators by hailing, waving of arms or any other bodily gesture. No arrest shall be made for a violation of this section unless the arresting officer first affords such person an opportunity to explain such conduct, and no one shall be convicted of violating this section if it appears at trial that the explanation given was true and disclosed a lawful purpose. 2 Silvar moved to dismiss the complaint against her arguing that CCO 12. 08. 30 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.

40|$|M, Development and Management, North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2012 South African Police Service (SAPS) is {{established}} to prevent crime and provide {{safe and secure}} living to {{the inhabitants of the}} country. The SAPS operates under the Justice Crime Prevention and Security (JCPS) Cluster to investigate and combat crime. In order to reduce the levels of crime, the SAPS has designed a SAPS Strategic Plan. The South African Police Service face challenges within the increasingly sophisticated, technological and international crime arena. To meet the demand the SAPS needs to upgrade the skills, competencies and capacity of its members and its ability to gather and use crime intelligence. According to the annual report of the Vanderbijlpark SAPS, 2008, the Bophelong/Muvhango (a township that falls under the town of Vanderbijlpark) has a rising crime rate {{due to the lack of}} following resources: two vehicles per area are available with two radios; six police officers are issued with two in-vehicles and two in Client Service Centre; six police officers employed on-duty per 1133 km 2 with 18 Extensions; lack of training facilities as police officers employed 15 years ago have not received any relevant training in order to improve their crime fighting skills; police officers are not provided with any training sessions in order for them to understand the SAPS Strategic Plan; and there are no public meetings to sensitize the community regarding the SAPS Strategic Plan that hinders their involvement in crime prevention. In order to improve the challenge, the study was conducted with a hypothesis formulated as: the effective South African Police Service Strategic Plan may lead to crime prevention in Bophelong / Muvhango at Vanderbijlpark. The findings from the literature review and the empirical research support the central statement. Findings indicate that in order to achieve the purpose stipulated in the hypothesis, there is a need for personnel to attend the SAPS training courses to understand the significance of the crime prevention strategy. This will further assist them to implement the strategy effectively to combat crime. Moreover, the training needs to be aligned with the SAPS Strategic Plan in order to achieve the objectives of crime prevention strategically and should focus on the human capacity for high performance in combating crime. The training offered guides the employees with the basics regarding to the performance of their duties and is aligned with the duties performed practically. The study explored the difficulties and challenges that SAPS faced in the crime prevention strategy at the area of the research as Bophelong/ Muvhango. The study states the following recommendations for Vanderbijlpark SAPS to minimize crime at Bophelong/ Muvhango: SAPS must involve the local community members in implementing any policy/programmes for crime prevention; for the safety of the community SAPS must train officials with relevant skills; officials must receive training that is aligned to the objectives of the SAPS; SAPS must spend on improving resources such as more <b>unmarked</b> <b>vehicle</b> with well trained specialized officers; SAPS must improve on effective communication system between the SAPS members and the members of the community; and SAPS must utilize the community radio slot or road show system to alert the community regarding occurrence of any nature of crime in their area. It is recommended that SAPS must learn lessons from best practices implemented in developing and developed countries to combat crime. Further research therefore could be based on comparative study whereby crime prevention models and approached from other countries be discussed, explored and applied in South Africa considering the availability of required resources at national level. The research explored the impact of implementation of SAPS Strategic Plan and offered valuable recommendations to improve the challenges regarding crime prevention at Bophelong /Muvhango of Vanderbijlpark. The research suggested a way forward in the form of further research for crime prevention in South Africa. Master...|$|E
