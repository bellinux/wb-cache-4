40|$|In the primitively eusocial {{tropical}} wasp Ropalidia marginata, {{five out}} of eleven colonies studied had an unmated female as their queen. In two colonies {{this was the case}} despite the presence of another mated individual in the colony. We found no detectable differences between colonies with <b>unmated</b> <b>queens</b> and those with mated queens. We argue that in species such as R. marginata, where intracolony relatedness is expected to be low and where sociality is likely to be maintained because several individuals have opportunities for direct reproduction in the future, individual selection is likely to override "the good of the colony" and lead to such phenomena as that of <b>unmated</b> <b>queens...</b>|$|R

2500|$|To mate, M. mexicanus winged queens {{and males}} emerge from an {{existing}} colony and swarm in nuptial flights. These flights occur in late July in the evening, typically {{at about the}} same time of day when the colony workers begin foraging. The flights usually occur the day after a rain. A normal nuptial flight lasts about an hour and half. After the flight, <b>unmated</b> <b>queens</b> and males return to the nest. The fact that some queens and males return from these flights unmated suggests that aerial union is difficult. [...] The mated queens lose their wings, and the mated males die.|$|R
40|$|A {{remarkable}} social polymorphism {{is controlled}} by a single Mendelian factor in the fire ant Solenopsis invicta. A genomic element marked by the gene Gp- 9 determines whether workers tolerate one or many fertile queens in their colony. Gp- 9 was recently shown {{to be part of}} a supergene with two nonrecombining variants, SB and Sb. SB/SB and SB/Sb queens differ in how they initiate new colonies, and in many physiological traits, for example odour and maturation rate. To understand how a single genetic element can affect all these traits, we used a microarray to compare gene expression patterns between SB/SB and SB/Sb queens of three different age classes: 1 -day-old <b>unmated</b> <b>queens,</b> 11 -day-old <b>unmated</b> <b>queens</b> and mated, fully reproductive queens collected from mature field colonies. The number of genes that were differentially expressed between SB/SB and SB/Sb queens of the same age class was smallest in 1 -day-old queens, maximal in 11 -day-old queens and intermediate in reproductive queens. Gene ontology analysis showed that SB/SB queens upregulate reproductive genes faster than SB/Sb queens. For all age classes, genes inside the supergene were overrepresented among the differentially expressed genes. Consistent with the hypothesized greater number of transposons in the Sb supergene, 13 transposon genes were upregulated in SB/Sb queens. Viral genes were also upregulated in SB/Sb mature queens, consistent with the known greater parasite load in colonies headed by SB/Sb queens compared with colonies headed by SB/SB queens. Eighteen differentially expressed genes between reproductive queens were involved in chemical signalling. Our results suggest that many genes in the supergene are involved in regulating social organization and queen phenotypes in fire ants...|$|R
40|$|International audienceColonies {{of social}} insects make {{numerous}} group decisions about foraging, nest maintenance, and reproduction. Queen production {{is a task}} whereby a colony's workers may exercise choices over which individuals to rear as gynes (<b>unmated</b> <b>queens)</b> and which gynes will survive to ultimately become queens. Here we assess the potential for how colonies of highly eusocial bees may exhibit such group decisions by reviewing the behaviors of stingless bee and honey bee workers during the gyne rearing, emergence, and elimination stages of queen production. We demonstrate that although the specific mechanisms whereby such decisions are manifested may vary among the taxa, {{there is a high}} potential for group decision making during queen production in eusocial bees. Given the importance of a queen to the inclusive fitness of all nestmates, such group decisions are likely to have a profound influence on the reproductive success of highly eusocial bee colonies. We briefly entertain the evolutionary mechanisms that may have shaped these group decision-making processes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceQueen {{elimination}} {{in honey}} bee colonies {{is a process}} by which {{all but one of}} the <b>unmated</b> <b>queens</b> produced during colony fission ("swarming") are eliminated from the parental nest. Queens are eliminated by three mechanisms: queen-queen duels, pre-emergence destruction, and departure with a secondary swarm. Here we describe each of these mechanisms of elimination and address important questions about queen elimination using detailed records of events from 13 observation-hive colonies undergoing queen elimination. We make the following conclusions. (1) The events during queen elimination occur in two distinct patterns: queen duels with secondary swarm departures, and no queen duels with pre-emergence destruction of all of the first-emerging queen's rivals. (2) The timing of secondary swarm departure is related to the events of queen elimination. (3) Queen duels are a common mechanism of elimination. (4) Workers play a significant but non-lethal role in queen elimination. (5) Queen elimination in European and African honey bee colonies is similar but the patterns of events may differ...|$|R
40|$|In social insects, cuticular {{hydrocarbons}} {{of adults}} may vary with ovarian activity. Such variations are suggested {{to function in}} the regulation of reproduction within colonies. The modification of the CH profile with ovarian activity is usually interpreted as a signal of fertility causing workers to refrain from reproducing {{in the presence of}} the queen. We examined the effect of ovarian activity on the CH profiles in the Argentine ant Linepithema humile, a species where workers lack ovaries and are completely sterile. Our data show considerable differences in the CH profiles between fertile and infertile individuals. These differences are mainly qualitative. The CH profile strongly changes at the start of egg laying, both in mated and <b>unmated</b> <b>queens.</b> These results show that variation in cuticular hydrocarbons with ovarian activity in ants is not restricted to species with worker reproduction. We propose that in the Argentine ant, the cuticular hydrocarbons of laying queens correspond to a signal of fertility involved in the regulation of various aspects of reproduction, such as the rearing of new sexuals.

40|$|Hamilton's haplodiploidy {{hypothesis}} {{suggests that}} the relatively higher relatedness of full sisters in haplodiploid populations promotes altruistic sib rearing and, consequently, the evolution of eusociality. This haplodiploidy effect works when some broods have a relatively female-biased sex ratio and other broods have a relatively male-biased sex ratio, termed split sex ratios. There is empirical evidence for two scenarios having potentially led to split sex ratios en route to eusociality: <b>unmated</b> <b>queens</b> and queen replacement. A recent analysis of these two scenarios has suggested that haplodiploidy can either promote or inhibit the evolution of eusociality and that the effect is usually small. However, this work made the simplifying assumptions {{that there is only}} negligible reproduction by workers and that their offspring have the same sex ratio as those produced by the queen. Here, we relax these assumptions and find that worker reproduction has a negative influence on the evolution of helping, either reducing {{the extent to which it}} is promoted or leading to it being inhibited. This is particularly so when workers are unmated and hence constrained to produce only sons, by arrhenotoky. Overall, when parameterized with empirical data, our results suggest that split sex ratios in haplodiploid species have not played an important role in facilitating the evolution of eusociality.

40|$|The {{inadvertent}} {{introduction of}} the fire ant Solenopsis invicta to the United States from South America provides the opportunity to study recent social evolution by comparing social organization in native and introduced populations. We report that several important elements of social organization in multiple-queen nests differ consistently and dramatically between ants in Argentina and the United States. Colonies in Argentina contain relatively few queens and they are close relatives, whereas colonies in the United States contain high numbers of unrelated queens. A corollary of these differences is that workers in the native populations are {{significantly related to the}} new queens that they rear in contrast to the zero relatedness between workers and new queens in the introduced populations. The observed differences in queen number and relatedness signal a shift in the breeding biology of the introduced ants that is predicted {{on the basis of the}} high population densities in the new range. An additional difference in social organization that we observed, greater proportions of permanently <b>unmated</b> <b>queens</b> in introduced than in native populations, is predicted from the loss of alleles at the sex-determining locus and consequent skewing of operational sex ratios in the colonizing ants. Thus, significant recent social evolution in fire ants is consistent with theoretical expectations based on the altered ecology and population genetics of the introduced populations...|$|R
40|$|Caste {{differentiation}} {{leading to}} reproductive {{division of labor}} {{is the hallmark of}} insect societies. Insect colonies typically contain mated queens that reproduce and workers with reduced fertility that undertake the tasks required for colony maintenance and development. Despite the prediction that the proportion of morphological castes should vary to enhance the fitness of colony members in response to environmental conditions, shifts in caste ratios have so far only been reported in a competitive situation. Societies of the ant Cerapachys biroi have evolved in an extraordinary way, in that queens and all workers reproduce through obligatory thelytokous parthenogenesis. Because workers of C. biroi represent the main reproductive force of the colony, the presence of such <b>unmated</b> <b>queens</b> seems puzzling. Here, we show that societies of C. biroi alter caste ratios by considerably increasing the production of queens when larvae are reared by sterile individuals in 2 situations: when senescent colonies are faced with food shortage or when well-fed larvae are reared by callow workers due to persisting plentiful resources. In the absence of these opposite conditions, larvae mostly develop into workers. Additional experiments suggest that these results are consistent with a contact pheromone to which larvae could be exposed when cared for by fertile individuals. In this species in which reproduction mainly relies on young workers with finite fertility, a self-regulated mechanism of caste differentiation could allow the enhancement of colony growth through worker production in fertile conditions or the restoration of colonial fertility through queen production in senescent societies.

40|$|Behavioral {{differentiation}} and ovarian {{development of}} <b>unmated</b> gynes, <b>queens,</b> and workers of Ectatomma vizottoi were investigated in laboratory conditions. Forty-one behavioral acts {{were identified and}} quantified for workers, 19 for queens and 24 for unmated gynes, for an overall species repertoire of 42 different behavioral acts. Ovipositing reproductive eggs was an exclusive task of the queen, whereas workers showed 15 caste-specific behaviors. The most important (frequent) behaviors for the queens were brood care, immobility, and reproduction, and for workers were immobility, grooming/interaction, brood care, and foraging. Unmated gynes (not winged) primarily showed immobility, brood care, grooming/interaction, and foraging. Analysis of ovarian development showed that unmated gynes had little-developed ovarioles, in contrast to <b>queens.</b> <b>Queens</b> and <b>unmated</b> gynes showed a clear behavioral differentiation, in which queens {{played the role of}} reproducers and unmated gynes performed activities belonging to the worker repertoire.

40|$|In the Argentine ant Linepithema humile (=Iridomyrmex humilis) only males {{disperse}} whereas female sexuals (<b>unmated</b> winged <b>queens)</b> stay {{in their}} mother nest where they mate. This study investigated (1) whether dispersing males are accepted into foreign colonies, (2) whether they can mate with resident female sexuals, and (3) whether the propensity of males to disperse {{is affected by the}} expectation of mating in their mother nest. Field experiments demonstrated that males were accepted into foreign colonies only when these colonies contained female sexuals or queen pupae. Before and after the time of (sic) female sexuals, workers attacked and killed most of the foreign males. Laboratory experiments snowed that males that successfully enter foreign colonies can mate with resident female sexuals. The propensity of males to disperse was significantly influenced by the presence of female sexuals in their nest. Males were more likely to fly out from colonies containing no female sexuals than from those with them. These results are consistent with males preferentially dispersing when {{there is little or no}} opportunity to mate in their mother nest. Thus there are two mating strategies available for males: staying in their mother nest when an opportunity to mate arises or dispersing and attempting to mate in a foreign nest when there are no female sexuals in their mother nest. This latter behaviour could mediate gene flow between colonies and account for the lack of significant inbreeding previously documented in this species...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In the {{honeybee}} Apis mellifera, female larvae {{destined to}} become a queen are fed with royal jelly, a secretion of the hypopharyngeal glands of young nurse bees that rear the brood. The protein moiety of royal jelly comprises mostly major royal jelly proteins (MRJPs) of which the coding genes (mrjp 1 - 9) have been identified on chromosome 11 in the honeybee’s genome. RESULTS: We determined the expression of mrjp 1 - 9 among the honeybee worker caste (nurses, foragers) and the sexuals (<b>queens</b> (<b>unmated,</b> mated) and drones) in various body parts (head, thorax, abdomen). Specific mrjp expression was not only found in brood rearing nurse bees, but also in foragers and the sexuals. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of mrjp 1 to 7 is characteristic for the heads of worker bees, with an elevated expression of mrjp 1 - 4 and 7 in nurse bees compared to foragers. Mrjp 5 and 6 were higher in foragers compared to nurses suggesting functions {{in addition to those}} of brood food proteins. Furthermore, the expression of mrjp 9 was high in the heads, thoraces and abdomen of almost all female bees, suggesting a function irrespective of body section. This completely different expression profile suggests mrjp 9 to code for the most ancestral major royal jelly protein of the honeybee.

40|$|Inclusive fitness theory {{predicts that}} sex {{investment}} ratios in eusocial Hymenoptera are {{a function of}} the relatedness asymmetry (relative relatedness to females and males) of the individuals controlling sex allocation. In monogynous ants (with one queen per colony), assuming worker control, the theory therefore predicts female-biased sex investment ratios, as found in natural populations. Recently, E. O. Wilson and M. A. Nowak criticized this explanation and presented an alternative hypothesis. The Wilson–Nowak sex ratio hypothesis proposes that, in monogynous ants, there is selection for a 1 : 1 numerical sex ratio to avoid males remaining <b>unmated,</b> which, given <b>queens</b> exceed males in size, results in a female-biased sex investment ratio. The hypothesis also asserts that, contrary to inclusive fitness theory, queens not workers control sex allocation and queen–worker conflict over sex allocation is absent. Here, I argue that the Wilson–Nowak sex ratio hypothesis is flawed because it contradicts Fisher’s sex ratio theory, which shows that selection on sex ratio does not maximize the number of mated offspring and that the sex ratio proposed by the hypothesis is not an equilibrium for the queen. In addition, the hypothesis is not supported by empirical evidence, as it fails to explain ‘split’ (bimodal) sex ratios or data showing queen and worker control and ongoing queen–worker conflict. By contrast, these phenomena match predictions of inclusive fitness theory. Hence, the Wilson–Nowak sex ratio hypothesis fails both as an alternative hypothesis for sex investment ratios in eusocial Hymenoptera and as a critique of inclusive fitness theory...|$|R
