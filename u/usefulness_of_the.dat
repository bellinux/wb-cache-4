5|$|The cockpit in the Sea Harrier {{includes}} a conventional centre stick arrangement and left-hand throttle. In addition to normal flight controls, the Harrier has a lever for controlling {{the direction of}} the four vectorable nozzles. The nozzles point rearward with the lever in the forward position for horizontal flight. With the lever back, the nozzles point downward for vertical takeoff or landing. The <b>usefulness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vertical landing capability of the Sea Harrier was demonstrated in an incident on 6 June 1983, when Sub Lieutenant Ian Watson lost contact with the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious and had to land Sea Harrier ZA176 on the foredeck of the Spanish cargo ship Alraigo.|$|E

The design of the batteries was based on the coastal batteries and entrenchments built by the Order in the 18th century, while most of the entrenchments consisted of long stretches of rubble walls. They were armed by guns taken from coastal fortifications such as Saint Mary's Tower.

These have been successful to varying degrees.|$|E
5|$|The <b>usefulness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Wall as a defence {{line against}} {{northern}} nomads became questionable under the Qing dynasty, since their territory encompassed vast areas {{inside and outside}} the wall: China proper, Manchuria, and Mongolia were all under Qing control. So instead, the Great Wall became the means to limit Han Chinese movement into the steppes. In the case of Manchuria, considered to be the sacred homeland by the ruling Manchu elites, some parts of the Ming Liaodong Wall were repaired so it could serve to control Han Chinese movement into Manchuria alongside the newly erected Willow Palisade.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} the mirror flaw on {{scientific}} observations depended on the particular observation—the core of the aberrated PSF was sharp enough to permit high-resolution observations of bright objects, and spectroscopy of point sources was only affected through a sensitivity loss. However, the loss of light to the large, out of focus halo severely reduced the <b>usefulness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> telescope for faint objects or high-contrast imaging. This meant that {{nearly all of the}} cosmological programs were essentially impossible, since they required observation of exceptionally faint objects. NASA and the telescope became the butt of many jokes, and the project was popularly regarded as a white elephant. For instance, in the 1991 comedy , Hubble was pictured with the Lusitania, the Hindenburg, and the Edsel. Nonetheless, during {{the first three years of}} the Hubble mission, before the optical corrections, the telescope still carried out a large number of productive observations of less demanding targets. The error was well characterized and stable, enabling astronomers to partially compensate for the defective mirror by using sophisticated image processing techniques such as deconvolution.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSince <b>the</b> {{emergence}} <b>of</b> Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), {{many studies}} have focused on <b>the</b> integration <b>of</b> uncertainties.

Finally, <b>the</b> quantification <b>of</b> uncertainty could introduce more confusion in decision-making. In this context, we propose joint implementation <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> qualitative and quantitative approaches to estimate uncertainties when performing Life Cycle Assessment of complex systems.

Using an LED as a reticle is an innovation that greatly improves the reliability and general <b>usefulness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sight: {{there is no need}} for other optical elements to focus light behind a reticle; the mirror can use a dichroic coating to reflect just the red spectrum, passing through most other light; and the LED itself is solid state and consumes very little power, allowing battery-powered sights to run for hundreds and even tens of thousands of hours.|$|E
