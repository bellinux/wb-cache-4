5|$|By July 2013 one firing <b>unit</b> <b>had</b> been converted, and was {{reported}} to be functioning correctly; by 2013 the conversion of the second and third units was scheduled for 2014 and during or before 2016 respectively. The second unit was converted by May 2014, initially co-firing an 85% biomass/coal mix due to limited biomass supply.|$|E

Miller had spent around 550 {{hours in the}} air with the RAF, to which his RAAF <b>unit</b> <b>had</b> been seconded. He was awarded the 1939–45 Star, France and Germany Star, Defence Medal, War Medal 1939–1945 and Australia Service Medal 1939–45.|$|E

5|$|Three organisations {{attempted}} {{to determine the}} location of Tito's headquarters and the disposition of Partisan forces in Drvar. The first of these was the Benesch Special Unit of Section II of the Abwehr (the Wehrmacht intelligence service), some members {{of which had been}} involved in identifying Tito's presence in the town of Jajce prior to the German offensive to retake the town. The Benesch Special Unit was part of the Brandenburg Division, and was staffed by ethnic Germans who spoke local languages. The <b>unit</b> <b>had</b> many contacts with both the Chetniks and Ustaše Militia, and had been tracking Tito since October 1943. Leutnant Kirchner of that <b>unit</b> <b>had</b> been responsible for locating Tito prior to the re-capture of Jajce, and he established a patrol base near Bosansko Grahovo. He got very close to the Drvar cave, and located the Allied military missions, but despite German radio intercepts confirming that Drvar was the site of Tito's headquarters, Kirchner was unable to pinpoint the cave as the location of the headquarters. Kirchner was attached to the 500th SS Parachute Battalion for the operation.|$|E
5|$|Undeterred, McCudden made {{a formal}} {{application}} {{to become a}} pilot and fly on operations but it was rejected on the grounds he was too valuable to risk losing. His reputation as a mechanic had spread since his supervision in the <b>unit</b> <b>had</b> led to a record-low number of engine failures. He continued to fly as an observer despite the recommendation of his rejection letter.|$|E
5|$|After {{making a}} recovery, Kizirian and the Marine units took {{the capital city}} of NaHa and were {{preparing}} for another assault. Kizirian's <b>unit</b> <b>had</b> fought its way to the crest of a hill and dug in. Kizirian was standing watch at the company command post inside an Okinawa burial ground. When replacements joined the company, many Japanese soldiers harassed the lines by infiltrating the positions of the more inexperienced soldiers. Kizirian ordered that flares should be fired at irregular intervals to would illuminate the scene and distract the enemy. The idea proved successful and the newly arrived Marines soon had the situation under control.|$|E

5|$|After recovering, {{he joined}} the Kimberley Mounted Corps and guided two {{officers}} from Lichtenburg to Klerksdorp, where they persuaded the Boers to surrender by bluffing that a strong British force was following close behind. The Boers soon retook the town and Guest was captured. He was sent with other prisoners to Pietersburg to be executed {{but he managed to}} escape and travelled to Warmbaths. After satisfying the authorities that he had actually been taken prisoner and had not surrendered voluntarily, he returned to his depot at Kimberley. His <b>unit</b> <b>had</b> been disbanded and he was discharged.|$|E
5|$|An ′iṣābā from Jableh led by Sheikh Izz ad-Din al-Qassam also formed {{part of the}} revolt. The French {{military}} authorities considered al-Qassam's group, which relocated its headquarters to the Jabal Sahyun village of Zanqufa from Jableh in early 1920, {{to be a part}} of al-Bitar's unit, but the two commanders operated in different sectors. Al-Bitar's <b>unit</b> <b>had</b> been active in Jabal Sahyun since early 1919 soon after French forces landed in Latakia. Al-Qassam left Syria to British-held Palestine sometime after the Battle of Maysalun to avoid capture by the French who issued a warrant for his arrest.|$|E
5|$|By 1828, Brazil {{could no}} longer sustain the war effort {{in the south and}} in April relinquished Cisplatina, which became the {{independent}} nation of Uruguay. Marques de Sousa was sent to Montevideo to serve under field marshal (present-day divisional general) Manuel Jorge Rodrigues, who commanded a Brazilian force temporarily stationed in the new country. On 29 March 1829, Marques de Sousa was made brevet (acting) major, and, on 28 August 1830, he was placed in command of the 6th company of 4th Regiment of Light Cavalry. Stationed in Rio Grande do Sul, the <b>unit</b> <b>had</b> previously been commanded by his father and his paternal grandfather.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{estimated}} that the <b>unit</b> <b>has</b> attended over 300,000 jobs in the past 60 years. The <b>Unit</b> <b>has</b> been involved {{in some of the}} States, and Australias, largest incidents including the following: ...|$|R
5|$|By March, however, Brooks' <b>unit</b> <b>had</b> {{grown to}} 110 men {{and he was}} {{promoted}} to Second Lieutenant and put in charge of a band of 40 soldiers, including Duncan. His guerrilla activities expanded to include larger raids, reprisal attacks, and the assassination of more important members of the Nazi regime. He would later earn the Polish Cross of Valor for helping lead over 100 of his men out of a German encirclement to safety without a single casualty. He {{made his way to the}} Russian front line in January 1945, and was eventually transferred from Lviv to Odessa, Port Said, Cairo, and finally London, where he arrived in March 1945.|$|E
5|$|By late 1940 Naujocks {{had been}} removed from his {{position}} after he fell out of favour with Heydrich. The counterfeiting unit continued under Langer before he left in early 1942 at which point it closed down; he later stated that over 18 months, the <b>unit</b> <b>had</b> produced around £3 million in forged notes; the historian Anthony Pirie puts the figure at £500,000. Most of the currency produced in Operation Andreas was never used.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1940, SS-Nordland and SS-Westland {{had become}} {{the basis for the}} {{formation}} of the fourth division, SS-Division Wiking. Casting about for another source of recruits, Berger struck upon the idea of enlisting convicted criminals, who were concentrated in the Sonderkommando Dirlewanger, commanded by Berger's friend, Dirlewanger. Dirlewanger had returned from Spain and been reinstated as a SS-Standartenfuhrer der Reserve in the Allgemeine SS at Berger's instigation. In September 1940, Dirlewanger's <b>unit</b> <b>had</b> been deployed to the area of occupied Poland, where they established defensive positions and provided guards for a Jewish labour camp.|$|E

The unit is one of 2 clinical units in Egypt in which the clinical service is run by qualified geriatricians.|$|R
5|$|Civil flights ceased {{when the}} central area at Heathrow opened in 1954 with Northolt {{reverting}} to sole military use in May that year. Northolt's operations became constrained by {{its proximity to}} the new much larger civil airport at Heathrow. No. 1 Aeronautical Information Documents Unit (AIDU) moved to the station in 1956 from the neighbouring RAF West Ruislip station. The <b>unit</b> <b>had</b> been established in 1953 to provide information on airfields, communications and navigational aids {{for the benefit of}} aircraft safety. AIDU was originally under the command of RAF Transport Command but this was moved to Home Command in March 1957.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} the {{battalion}} received a number of reinforcements from its associated Militia unit, the 3rd Battalion (The Werriwa Regiment). This <b>unit</b> <b>had</b> been fighting in New Guinea {{as part of the}} 30th Brigade, with whom it had served on the Kokoda Track alongside the 2/3rd as well as the 39th and 49th Battalions, before being returned to Australia, where it had been disbanded. Other reinforcements also arrived from the 16th Battalion, and a new commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Ian Hutchison took over in April 1943, having temporarily commanded the battalion during the fighting around Eora Creek in the previous campaign.|$|E
5|$|Following the Battle of Inchon and {{subsequent}} Second Battle of Seoul, the North Korean Army was largely defeated, and the 19th Infantry {{was one of}} the units of the Eighth United States Army which pursued the fleeing North Koreans north of the 38th Parallel with the intention of reuniting the country. However, beginning in October 1950, the People's Republic of China conducted the First Phase Offensive, a surprise attack against the advancing United Nations forces, which were unprepared to counter the offensive. By early November, Red Cloud and his <b>unit</b> <b>had</b> advanced to the Ch'ongch'on River.|$|E
50|$|The 1270 {{class was}} devised by English Electric {{engineer}} Stan Lyons, {{based on the}} body design of North American road switcher but using the same engine and generator as the 1250 class. The first 12 <b>units</b> <b>had</b> the same English Electric 525 traction motors as the 1250 class. The remaining <b>units</b> <b>had</b> improved English Electric 548 traction motors with a slightly higher tractive effort. The final six <b>units</b> <b>had</b> dynamic brakes.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to assisting migrants, BORSTAR <b>units</b> <b>have</b> helped hikers, motorists, and other Border Patrol agents {{in need of}} rescue. [...] BORSTAR <b>units</b> <b>have</b> responded to FEMA requests for assistance, including Hurricane Katrina rescue operations.|$|R

5|$|In February 2009, Ólafur Hauksson (b. Reykjavík 1964) was appointed; {{it was the}} Icelandic government's second {{attempt to}} appoint to the role, and Ólafur {{was one of only}} two applicants. He had {{previously}} been the police chief in Akranes. At the time the <b>unit</b> <b>had</b> four staff members; by September 2013 it had 109, with 140 cases under investigation. By that time, the top managers of all three Icelandic banks which collapsed during the financial crisis had been charged, though the cases progressed slowly.|$|E
5|$|In the morning, {{under cover}} of a heavy ground fog, the North Koreans struck Check's {{battalion}} in a counterattack. This began a heavy fight which lasted all morning. Air strikes using napalm incinerated many North Korean troops and helped the infantry to gain the ridge. At 12:00, the 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry, secured the former positions of the 2nd Battalion, 24th Infantry, and took over the same foxholes that <b>unit</b> <b>had</b> abandoned two nights before. During September 2, the Air Force flew 135 sorties in the 25th Infantry Division sector, reportedly destroying many North Korean units, several tanks and artillery pieces, and three villages containing ammunition dumps.|$|E
5|$|The 2/6th Independent Company {{arrived in}} Port Moresby from Australia on 2 August 1943. The <b>unit</b> <b>had</b> fought in Papua in 1942 in the Battle of Buna–Gona and had since {{conducted}} intensive training in Queensland. The company {{was under the}} command of Captain Gordon King, who had been its second in command at Buna. King received a warning order on 12 September alerting him to prepare for the capture of Kaiapit, and had access to detailed aerial photographs of the area.|$|E
50|$|On the PC (DOS and Microsoft Windows platforms), two {{encodings}} became {{established for}} Japanese and Traditional Chinese {{in which all}} of singletons, lead units and trail units overlapped: Shift-JIS and Big5 respectively. In Shift-JIS, lead <b>units</b> <b>had</b> the range 81-9F and E0-FC, trail <b>units</b> <b>had</b> the range 40-7E and 80-FC, and singletons had the range 21-7E and A1-DF. In Big5, lead <b>units</b> <b>had</b> the range A1-FE, trail <b>units</b> <b>had</b> the range 40-7E and A1-FE, and singletons had the range 21-7E (all values in hexadecimal). This overlap again made processing tricky, though at least most of the symbols had unique byte values (though strangely the backslash does not).|$|R
50|$|There {{were also}} two main classes of F7's: {{passenger}} and freight. Most passenger <b>units</b> <b>had</b> {{upper and lower}} headlights, but this wasn't always the rule. Many freight <b>units</b> <b>had</b> the upper Mars or Pyle brand warning light as well. And some passenger <b>units</b> only <b>had</b> a single upper headlight, i.e. the Pennsylvania. Many <b>units</b> <b>had</b> the upper lights plated over later in life, or the door light removed/plated over and the Mars/Pyle light removed. These early warning lights had lots of moving linkages and a motor that were high maintenance for the shops.|$|R
50|$|Every {{reactive}} <b>unit</b> <b>has</b> {{the same}} reactivity regardless of other factors. For example, a reactive group A on a 20-mer (a polymer with 20 monomer <b>units)</b> <b>has</b> the same reactivity as another group A on a 2000-mer.|$|R
