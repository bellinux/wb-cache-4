40|$|Usury is the {{charging}} of interest {{for the use of}} money as a rate in excess of that permitted by statute. The Bankruptcy Act allows the trustee-in-bankruptcy to plead the defense of usury to a creditor 2 ̆ 7 s claim. A debtor-in-possession in a Chapter XI proceeding, who has all the rights and powers of the trustee, may also assert the defense of usury. There is, however, no federal usury statute and the Bankruptcy Act defines neither usury nor its effect. To resolve the usury issue the bankruptcy court has to look to the law of the jurisdiction in which the loan arose. The conflict among the state jurisdictions as to the effect given to an <b>usurious</b> <b>loan</b> obscures bankruptcy 2 ̆ 7 s traditional distinction between the allowance and the enforcement of a claim.

The situation goes against the development of rural production and causes the extreme lack of rural capital, the difficulties in loaning and the prevalence of <b>usurious</b> <b>loan</b> In view of the problems existed in rural financial system, the rural financial developmental trend. rural gross production. rural financial scale and rural financial efficiency from 1983 to 2008 are empirically analyzed by using the Pagano model in endogenous growth theory. the research assumes that, rural financial scale has positive relation with rural economic output, that is to say, the expansion of rural financial scale can facilitate the development of rural economy; the rural financial efficiency has negative relation with rural economic development. In Chinese rural areas, the economic development still relies on the expansion of rural finance. However, {{at the same time}} of increasing the financial scale, the efficiency of rural finance is deceasing gradually. Thus, the support of rural finance on rural economic growth lies at the low level. Therefore, in view of the basic prerequisite of rural economic development, two solutions are adopted and Japanese and Korea experience are used. The measures are as follows. First, conducting organization innovation through promoting new village construction and gathering dispersed farmers to form rural cooperative organization to reduce transaction cost. Second, transforming financial support from exogeneity to endogeneity and market-oriented rural finance to effectively solve the efficiency of rural finance.

5000|$|In 1976, during {{visits to}} the poorest {{households}} {{in the village of}} Jobra near Chittagong University, Yunus discovered that very small loans could make a disproportionate difference to a poor person. Village women who made bamboo furniture had to take <b>usurious</b> <b>loans</b> to buy bamboo, and repay their profits to the lenders. Traditional banks did not want to make tiny loans at reasonable interest to the poor due to high risk of default. But Yunus believed that, given the chance, the poor will repay the money and hence microcredit was a viable business model. [...] Yunus lent US$27 of his money to 42 women in the village, who made a profit of BDT 0.50 (US$0.02) each on the loan. Thus, Yunus is credited with the idea of microcredit alongside Dr. Akhtar Hameed Khan, founder of the Pakistan Academy for Rural Development (now Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development), whom Yunus greatly admired.|$|R
50|$|Following the Battle of Caseros, Governor Rosas {{fled the}} country and, with the {{enactment}} of the Constitution of Argentina in May 1853, Alcorta was elected to the Argentine Senate. He formed part of the modern Senate's first Committee on Customs Regulation; as such, wrote the nation's first Law of Expropriation and influenced policy over one of the nation's most divisive institutions: customs. The regulation of the Ports of Buenos Aires and those along the Paraná River, as well as the distribution of customs revenue, remained one of the greatest threats to national unity as late as 1880, and Alcorta supported the procurement of foreign credit to maintain the Paraná customs as a means to lessen Argentina's dependence on revenue from secessionist Buenos Aires. A respected arbiter of the many conflicts surrounding customs collection, he was named to the powerful Commerce Tribunal and Government Advisory Council. He was also a noted supporter of the expansion of domestic credit, which he hoped could avoid excess reliance on the often <b>usurious</b> <b>loans</b> obtained in Paris. His treatise, Banks and Their Usefulness in Argentina, helped lead to his appointment to the Public Credit Administration, and he served as President of the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange from 1855 to 1857.|$|R
5000|$|Under risk-based pricing, {{creditors}} tend {{to demand}} extremely {{high interest rates}} {{as a condition of}} extending unsecured debt. The maximum loss on a properly collateralized loan is the difference between the fair market value of the collateral and the outstanding debt. Thus, in the context of secured lending, the use of collateral reduces the size of the [...] "bet" [...] taken by the creditor on the debtor's creditworthiness. Without collateral, the creditor stands to lose the entire sum outstanding at the point of default, and must boost the interest rate to price in that risk.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} investigate the statistical relationship among casino activities, crime rates and number of visitors in Las Vegas, NV. Numerous studies have attempted {{to answer the question}} whether casino gaming increases crime rates. Casino gaming is statistically correlated with more crimes when researchers use the reported crime rate, i. e., ratio of the number of crimes to local population. However, there is no statistical relationship between the two when researchers use the visitor adjusted crime rate (henceforth adjusted crime rate), i. e., ratio of the number of crimes to local population and visitors, in their analyses. Somewhat surprisingly, previous studies have failed to consider the endogeneity issue, i. e., coincidental impacts of casino activities and crimes. This paper addresses endogeneity among variables by estimating the impact of casino activities on crimes and also impact of crimes on casino activities. To deal with endogeneity, a system of three equations representing casino activities, the number of visitors, and visitor adjusted crime rates is estimated using three stage least squares. Elasticity of the casino revenue with respect to the adjusted crime rate is estimated to be +- 0. 22 +- 0. 1 and elasticity of the adjusted crime rate with respect to casino revenue to be 0. 29 +- 0. 27. In addition, using the regression of the personal income on the casino revenue in Las Vegas, the impact of the adjusted crime rate on the regional economy is estimated. Results show that one percent increase in crime leads to cumulative decreases in the personal income by $ 105 +-$ 44 per household per year. Policy implications based on findings in this research are i) efforts to reduce crime can be effective tool to boost the regional economy (in Las Vegas), ii) cutting the link between casino gambling and crime is important; to cut the link, pay more attention on education or regulation to reduce pathological gamblers, <b>usurious</b> <b>loans</b> and the fraud related to casino gambling, and iii) improving the image of casino gambling that are related to crimes and thus attracting more visitors...|$|R

5000|$|Nine {{years had}} hardly {{passed since the}} {{expulsion}} of 1306 when Louis X of France (1314-16) recalled the Jews. In an edict dated 28 July 1315, he permitted them to return {{for a period of}} twelve years, authorizing them to establish themselves in the cities in which they had lived before their banishment. He issued this edict in answer {{to the demands of the}} people. Geoffrey of Paris, the popular poet of the time, says in fact that the Jews were gentle in comparison with the Christians who had taken their place, and who had flayed their debtors alive; if the Jews had remained, the country would have been happier; for there were no longer any moneylenders at all (Bouquet, xxii. 118). The king probably had the interests of his treasury also in view. The profits of the former confiscations had gone into the treasury, and by recalling the Jews for only twelve years he would have an opportunity for ransoming them at the end of this period. It appears that they gave the sum of 122,500 livres for the privilege of returning. It is also probable, as Adolphe Vuitry states, that a large number of the debts owing to the Jews had not been recovered, and that the holders of the notes had preserved them; the decree of return specified that two-thirds of the old debts recovered by the Jews should go into the treasury. The conditions under which they were allowed to settle in the land are set forth in a number of articles; some of the guaranties which were accorded the Jews had probably been demanded by them and been paid for. They were to live by the work of their hands or to sell merchandise of a good quality; they were to wear the circular badge, and not discuss religion with laymen. They were not to be molested, either with regard to the chattels they had carried away at the time of their banishment, or with regard to the loans which they had made since then, or in general with regard to anything which had happened in the past. Their synagogues and their cemeteries were to be restored to them on condition that they would refund their value; or, if these could not be restored, the king would give them the necessary sites at a reasonable price. The books of the Law that had not yet been returned to them were also to be restored, with the exception of the Talmud. After the period of twelve years granted to them the king might not expel the Jews again without giving them a year's time in which to dispose of their property and carry away their goods. They were not to lend on usury, and no one was to be forced by the king or his officers to repay to them <b>usurious</b> <b>loans.</b> If they engaged in pawnbroking, they were not to take more than two deniers in the pound a week; they were to lend only on pledges. Two men with the title [...] "auditors of the Jews" [...] were entrusted with the execution of this ordinance, and were to take cognizance of all claims that might arise in connection with goods belonging to the Jews which had been sold before the expulsion for less than half of what was regarded as a fair price. The king finally declared that he took the Jews under his special protection, and that he desired to have their persons and property protected from all violence, injury, and oppression.|$|R
40|$|For years, {{community}} groups and advocates {{around the country}} have waged pitched battles to eliminate payday lending in their respective states. Notwithstanding extensive documentation of the payday lending debt trap and the billions of dollars payday lenders have systematically stripped from low-income families and communities, especially those of color, the payday lending industry has cannily built and exerted its political power in state capitols throughout the U. S. As a result, many states permit usurious payday lending, with often dire consequences for millions of payday loan borrowers already struggling to make ends meet. A key move in the industry's playbook is to convince states {{that the best way to}} address predatory payday lending is to regulate the industry. But regulations in states that authorize payday loans are too often written by industry and porous at best, and across the board fail to eliminate the hooks that trap people in these <b>usurious</b> and harmful <b>loans.</b> Other less subtle strategies the industry employs are to co-opt state legislators through generous campaign contributions, and to lobby aggressively against any and all attempts to prohibit or curtail payday lending. This report presents snapshots on payday loan regulation in four key states [...] California, Illinois, New York, and North Carolina. The snapshots are intended to provide helpful lessons and serve as a useful basis for comparison. Although New York has long prohibited payday lending altogether through its strong usury law, North Carolina opened the door to payday lending for five years before restoring its previous ban in 2001. Illinois, by contrast, has attempted to restrict payday lending through a series of legislative and regulatory reforms adopted over the past 12 years, many of which the industry immediately circumvented. California, for its part, has few payday loan regulations on the books. While some cities and counties in California have sought to curb payday lending by passing local ordinances, the industry has to date successfully thwarted all efforts to pass meaningful state-level protections. The four organizations that prepared the snapshots [...] California Reinvestment Coalition, New Economy Project (formerly NEDAP), Reinvestment Partners, and Woodstock Institute [...] offer their perspective as financial justice advocates that have been in the thick of payday lending battles in their home states. Their direct experience with a range of regulatory frameworks has shown that strong usury caps have proven the single most effective means of banning payday lending. The report comes at an exciting time. Advocates have spent years refuting and defending against the payday lending industry's shameless and aggressive lobbying, and there is now a clear turning of the tide. Last month, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau published a comprehensive study on storefront and bank payday loans, which showed how payday loans lead many borrowers to a long-term cycle of indebtedness. That same week, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued strong proposed guidance that would effectively rein in predatory payday lending by banks. There is an emerging chorus at local, state, and federal levels calling for an end to payday lending [...] whether by banks, storefront payday lenders, or over the internet [...] and the squeeze is now squarely on the industry. The changing dynamic will likely increase pressure in battleground states, such as California and Illinois, and we hope soon to see strong federal action that ends payday lending once and for all...|$|R
