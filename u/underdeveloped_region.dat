5|$|Conscious {{and planned}} {{colonization}} of the fertile, but <b>underdeveloped</b> <b>region</b> was pioneered in the 1580s and 1590s by the Ruthenian dukes of Volhynia. Of the Poles, only Jan Zamoyski, who penetrated the Bracław area, was economically active {{by the end}} of the 16th century. There and in the Kiev area Polish fortunes also began to develop, often through intermarriage with Ruthenian clans. In 1630, the great Ukrainian latifundia were dominated by Ruthenian families, such as the Ostrogski, Zbaraski and Zasławski. At the outset of the great civil war of 1648, the Polish settlers comprised barely 10% of the middle and petty nobility, for example in the well-researched Bracław Voivodeship and Kiev Voivodeship. The early Cossack rebellions were, therefore, instants of social uprising, rather than national anti-Polish movements. As class warfare they were ruthlessly stamped out by the state, which would sometimes take their leaders to Warsaw for execution.|$|E

500|$|In 1915, {{during the}} First World War, Serbian Macedonia was invaded by Bulgaria, which {{captured}} Skopje on 22 October 1915 [...] Serbia, allied to the Triple Entente, was helped by France, Britain, Greece, and Italy, which formed the Macedonian Front. Following a great Allied offensive in 1918, the Armée française d'Orient reached Skopje 29 September {{and took the}} city by surprise. After {{the end of the}} World War, Macedonia became part of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, which became [...] "Kingdom of Yugoslavia" [...] in 1929. A mostly foreign ethnic Serb ruling class gained control, imposing a repression unknown under the previous Turkish rulers. The policies of de-Bulgarisation and assimilation were pursued. At that time part of the young locals, repressed by the Serbs, tried to find a separate way of ethnic Macedonian development. In 1931, in a move to formally decentralize the country, Skopje was named the capital of the Vardar Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Until the Second World War, Skopje experienced strong economic growth, and its population increased. The city had 41,066 inhabitants in 1921, 64,807 in 1931, and 80,000 in 1941. Although located in an <b>underdeveloped</b> <b>region,</b> it attracted wealthy Serbs who opened businesses and contributed to the modernisation of the city. In 1941, Skopje had 45 factories, half of the industry in the whole of Macedonia.|$|E

On the basis of the literature, it was found that both the community patient’s assessment of community medical service and trust in community health delivery system were important considerations when the community patient comprehensively evaluated community medical service to generate life satisfaction. So this study was set up to test whether and to what extent the community patient’s assessments of various major aspects of community medical service/various major aspects of the community patient’s trust in community health delivery system influenced life satisfaction in whole China/in various regions of China. Methods: In order to explore the situation of China’s community health delivery system before 2009 and provide a reference for China’s community health delivery system reform, the data that could comprehensively and accurately reflect the community patient’s life satisfaction, assessment of community medical service, and trust in community health delivery system in various regions of China was needed, so this study collaborated with the National Bureau of Statistics of China to carry out a large-scale 2008 national community resident household survey (N = 3, 306) {{for the first time in}} China. And the specified ordered probit models were established to analyze the dataset from this household survey. Results: Among major aspects of community medical service, the medical cost (particularly in developed regions), the doctor-patient communication (particularly in developed regions), the medical facility and hospital environment (particularly in developed regions), and the medical treatment process (particularly in <b>underdeveloped</b> <b>regions)</b> were all key considerations (p< 0. 05 for t statistics) in generating the community patient’s life satisfaction.

The methodological basis of the research is comprised of a specially developed proprietary methodology for the evaluation of regional competitiveness and a modified factor analysis methodology for the determination of factors of regional economic growth using the 'economic miracle' case for various regions.

[...] Myrdal called for economists to proceed by confronting the ‘facts of life’ with theories. The relation between theory and facts is, however, not simple. [...] Theory … must always be a priori to the observations of facts. Indeed, facts as part of scientific knowledge have no existence outside such a frame. … If theory is thus a priori, it is, on the other hand, a first principle of science that facts are sovereign. Theory is, in other words, never more than a hypothesis. When the observations of facts do not agree with a theory, i.e. when they do not make sense in the frame of the theory utilised in carrying out the research, the theory has to be discarded and replaced by another one which promises a better fit (Myrdal, G.
