25|$|The Rebel is a STOL {{aircraft}} and {{was designed to}} be a personal-use bush plane. It can operate from short, unimproved airstrips and can carry a <b>useful</b> <b>load</b> of up to 750lbs.|$|E
25|$|Pipistrel {{introduced}} an electric version called the Alpha Electro in 2015 {{at a price}} of 69,000 euros, with technology from the Pipistrel WATTsUP proof of concept design, for short training. It has energy for one flight hour plus reserves, and can recharge in 45 minutes or have its batteries replaced in 5 minutes. Instead of 78lb (35.5kg) of fuel, it has 277 pounds (126kg) of LiPo cells, however the water cooled electric motor weighs 11kg; {{much less than the}} gasoline engine. It has a <b>useful</b> <b>load</b> of 380lb, whereas a Cessna 152 has between 350-480lb <b>useful</b> <b>load.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{analyzing}} the imminent end of Skycatcher production Paul Bertorelli of AVweb {{indicated that the}} reasons for ending production were high price, poor <b>useful</b> <b>load</b> and lackluster flight performance compared to its LSA market competitors.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} are of composite construction, with carbon fiber being the primary material. This allows a very aerodynamic shape to the fuselage and very high <b>useful</b> <b>loads</b> (almost {{equal to the}} weight of the aircraft itself).|$|R
50|$|The Farman F.140 Super Goliath {{was a very}} large, four engine biplane night bomber, {{designed}} in France in the mid-1920s. Nine flew with the French Air Force until concerns about structural weakness grounded them in 1930. The prototype set several world records for altitude reached with heavy <b>useful</b> <b>loads.</b>|$|R
5000|$|This is the Queen Air {{powered by}} two Lycoming IGSO-480s {{producing}} [...] with a 1400-hour TBO. It had a gross weight of 7700 lb with <b>useful</b> <b>loads</b> around 2000 lb. It is easily recognized by its straight unswept tail. Usually {{referred to as}} a [...] "straight 65". Produced from 1960 to 1966.|$|R
25|$|After {{the end of}} the war, {{large numbers}} of surplus DH.9s became available, having been deemed to be surplus to {{requirements}} by their original military operators; accordingly, many were resold onto civil operators, such as by early aerial transport companies. Large numbers were modified to better perform as transport aircraft, such as the cabin being suitably adapted for the carriage of passengers. In this role, the DH.9 provided a <b>useful</b> <b>load</b> carrying capability and were relatively inexpensive to procure. Accordingly, in various configurations, the type saw prolific use by civil operators.|$|E
25|$|The first AB 1 {{was built}} in 1918 and {{probably}} flew that year. There were plans for a variant using more powerful Hispano-Suiza 8Ba engines, the AB 2, {{but this was not}} built. Post war, two civilian variants were started, the post-carrying AB 3 and the passenger only or passenger plus post AB 4. The AB 3, one of which was completed in 1920, could carry a <b>useful</b> <b>load</b> of 905kg (1,95lb). The AB 4, which had the same engines as the proposed AB 2, carried a maximum of seven passengers. Its fuselage was on display at the 6th Paris Aero Show in December 1919, but it was not completed.|$|E
25|$|The Latécoère 350 first flew on 2 February 1931, piloted by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. It {{turned out}} that the 350 had come out more than 30% overweight, an excess of about a tonne. Consequently the <b>useful</b> <b>load</b> was reduced from the design {{estimate}} of 1,000kg (2,205lbs) to about 350kg (772lbs), making the 350 quite unfit for purpose. In view of that, it hardly mattered that flight tests showed that some of the performance estimates were optimistic: maximum speed was 5% less and the stalling speed higher. Since the aircraft was government funded and its property, Saint-Exupéry flew it to Villacoublay early in 1933. Its career thereafter is not recorded.|$|E

25|$|An initial, {{experimental}} prototype, {{powered by}} four Turbomeca Turmo II engines, the Breguet 940 Integral, first flew on 21 May 1958, {{and was used}} to prove the concept, demonstrating excellent short field performance. This led to an order being placed in February 1960 for a prototype of an aircraft employing the same concept, but capable of carrying <b>useful</b> <b>loads.</b> This aircraft, the Breguet 941, first flew on 1 June 1961.|$|R
40|$|Metalclad airship {{development}} of the past history are considered along with the immediate prospects for continuation of the {{development of}} these airships. The metalclad airships promise high safety even in highly inclement weather, are capable of high speeds, while lifting high <b>useful</b> <b>loads.</b> Metalclad airships which in first cost would compare favorably with the costs of sea-going ships and in operating costs promise to be lower than airplanes...|$|R
25|$|Avro first {{proposed}} {{to build the}} Avro 687 (Avro XX), which was a Lincoln bomber with a new circular section pressurized fuselage and a large single fin and rudder {{in place of the}} predecessor's double ones. During the design stage, the idea of a simple conversion was abandoned and the Avro 688 was designed, which retained the four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines. It was designed by Roy Chadwick who, due to wartime restrictions, could not design a completely new aircraft, but had to use existing parts, tools and jigs. Using the Lincoln's wing, Chadwick, who had worked on the Lancaster, designed the Tudor to incorporate a new pressurized fuselage of circular cross-section, with a <b>useful</b> <b>load</b> of 3,765lb (1,705kg) and a range of 3,975mi (6,400km).|$|E
25|$|This initial batch {{offered little}} {{improvement}} over the BE.2, and was rejected for service in France. Aircraft following this initial batch were completed to a revised design, with a new fin and rudder, its leading edge straight and lacking the earlier comma shaped horn balance, and powered by the Renault-related but more powerful 90hp (67kW) RAF 1a engine. Both crew were placed in a single, extended cockpit with the pilot forward, allowing the observer a more effective field of fire, although in the event few F.K.3s were flown with armament. Trials at Upavon in May 1916 proved that the F.K.3 had a better performance in some respects than the B.E.2c, although it had a smaller <b>useful</b> <b>load.</b> Armstrong Whitworth were given a contract to build 150 aircraft with another 350 being built by Hewlett & Blondeau Limited at Luton. Some of the early batch had twin high exhaust pipes that exited above the upper wing in B.E.2 style, but these were later replaced with rams' horns forward stubs.|$|E
