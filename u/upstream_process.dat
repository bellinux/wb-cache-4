50|$|Pilot {{operated}} surge {{relief valves}} are typically {{used to protect}} pipelines that move low viscosity products like gasoline or diesel. This style of valve is installed downstream of the pump/valve that creates the surge. The valve is controlled by an external, normally closed pilot valve. The pilot will be set to the desired set point of the system, with a sense line that runs up stream of the valve. When the <b>upstream</b> <b>process</b> conditions start to exceed the pilot set point, the valve begins to open and relieve the excess pressure until the correct pressure is met causing the valve to close.|$|E
50|$|Pipelines {{are often}} {{implemented}} in a multitasking OS, by launching all elements {{at the same}} time as processes, and automatically servicing the data read requests by each process with the data written by the <b>upstream</b> <b>process</b> - this can be called a multiprocessed pipeline. In this way, the CPU will be naturally switched among the processes by the scheduler so as to minimize its idle time. In other common models, elements are implemented as lightweight threads or as coroutines to reduce the OS overhead often involved with processes. Depending upon the OS, threads may be scheduled directly by the OS or by a thread manager. Coroutines are always scheduled by a coroutine manager of some form.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNumerous {{biopharmaceuticals}} {{are produced}} in recombinant microorganisms in the controlled environment of a bioreactor, {{a process known}} as <b>Upstream</b> <b>Process.</b> To minimize product loss due to physico-chemical and enzymatic degradation, the <b>Upstream</b> <b>Process</b> should be directly followed by product purification, known as Downstream Process. However, the Downstream Process can be technologically complex and time-consuming which is why Upstream and Downstream Process usually have to be decoupled temporally and spatially. Consequently, the product obtained after the <b>Upstream</b> <b>Process,</b> known as intermediate bulk, has to be stored. In those circumstances, a freezing procedure is often performed to prevent product loss. However, the freezing process itself is inseparably linked to physico-chemical changes of the intermediate bulk which may in turn damage the product. The present study analysed the behaviour of a Tris-buffered intermediate bulk containing a biopharmaceutically relevant protein during a bottle freezing process. Major damaging mechanisms, like the spatiotemporal redistribution of ion concentrations and pH, and their influence on product stability were investigated. Summarizing, we show the complex events which happen in an intermediate bulk during freezing and explain the different causes for product loss...|$|E

40|$|The {{flexibility}} of sheet metal assembly processes {{is one of}} the most critical issues in the design stage of assembly systems. Currently in the automotive industry, flexibility and adaptability of assembly systems are mainly considered as the capability to assemble a family of products.

This paper presents a systematic method of flexible/adaptive assembly system evaluation, based on its ability to compensate for part dimensional variability caused by <b>upstream</b> <b>processes.</b> This allows for the expansion of the present design for manufacturability approaches by applying multivariate analysis and fixture diagnostic techniques.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{simulate}} the large scale production of monoclonal antibody (mAb) by using SuperPro Designer (SPD). Since the first discovery of mAb at 1970 s, this type of antibody had become the most rapidly growing class of pharmaceutical. Problem with mAb production is the high cost and low amount of production but high demand for this therapeutic. In order to overcome this problem, large scale production had become one of the top priorities for mAb production. Large scale simulation study by using SPD can minimize time and cost production by eliminate the high cost of trial-and-error steps, as well as to find and simulate the optimization process for mAb production. In order to achieve the objective of this research, study is conducted in two steps which are simulation on the upstream and downstream process. For the <b>upstream</b> <b>process,</b> the stoichiometric equation is constructed base on the laboratory data and used to simulate the large volume of fermenter. For a downstream process, three flow of downstream process from different source a built, simulated and compared to choose the best process for purification of mAb. The result shows that the <b>upstream</b> <b>process</b> for 20000 L fermenter produced 0. 00510 kg/Batch of mAb with concentration of 3. 8 × 10 - 4 g/L (5. 1103 g/Batch).

There exist several environmental assessment approaches for electronics, but still no effective model for LCI data collection exists. The objective is to develop a model for LCI data collection of the <b>upstream</b> <b>processes</b> of electronic products, apply it and find the environmental load of a GaAs MMIC Switch Product based on so-called SIP concept utilising a LCP substrate. EcoLab and available literature data were used to analyse the environmental loads. The results show that manufacturing of hardware has {{a significant impact on the}} LCA results for a telecommunications exchange. For Paper I, as much as 50 % of the <b>upstream</b> manufacturing <b>processes</b> applied to the raw materials to transform them into components were left out. Integrated circuits and printed wiring boards dominate the hardware contribution to the environmental load of the whole telecommunications exchange. The observed significant environmental impact of inductors in the LCA in paper I may well be an effect of the LCI data used being poorly representative of the full range of inductive components. An LCI of a digital telephone would lead to more than 120 unit processes requiring to be inventoried, but some of the unit processes for silicon containing components are similar, which would simplify the inventory. The result of an environmental assessment of the manufacturing process for a GaAs switch showed that spin coating and deposition are environmental hot spots. From the present work it is shown that the data gathering requirement is vast, but not as large as it would be if every component had to be inventoried from cradle-to-gate. The data collection can be minimized if the proposed model for data collection is used. In the present thesis it is also shown that the data collection model could be used for a GaAs MMIC SIP switch module. The <b>upstream</b> <b>processes</b> are not negligible in LCA of electronics, especially not the processing of monocrystalline wafers...|$|R

The aim of the present thesis {{is to increase the}} knowledge of using LCA tools, methods and models, in application to current and new microelectronic products. A subgoal is to establish {{a better understanding of how}} to collect data to be used in a Life-Cycle Inventory (LCI) and environmentally assess the importance of the <b>upstream</b> <b>processes.</b> The objective has been to explore how variants of LCA could be used in microelectronics applications and the LCA software EcoLab and available data were utilised to analyse environmental loads. Different case studies were performed on (i) microelectronic products, (ii) substrate and soldering materials, and (iii) plating and soldering processes. The main emphasis has been on the <b>upstream</b> <b>processes.</b> Analysis of the results shows that the input data needed for environmental assessment of electronics applications comes from many different sources. An LCI data collection model applicable to most electronic products helps quantifying <b>upstream</b> <b>processes.</b> This is explained for a digital telephone. The global shift from Sn-Pb to Pb-free solder paste was modelled using attributional LCA and consequential LCA. It was found that the attributional and consequential methodologies yield complimentary knowledge about the environmental consequences of the shift. In this thesis, uncertainty estimation in LCI using Monte Carlo simulation was also investigated. The approach was applicable to small one parameter cradle-to-gate systems. There are strong indications that electrochemical pattern replication is more CO 2 efficient than conventional photolithography, and that glass fiber enforced liquid crystalline polymers are more CO 2 efficient than the corresponding brominated epoxy (FR 4), polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon®) and ceramic/glass tape. In addition to this, the effect of system expansion of manufacturing processes of the new packaging concept System-In-a-Package was addressed. This expansion of the upstream product system changes the relative environmental importance of manufacturing processes. Overall, environmental LCA are applicable to microelectronics packaging, but the assessments are hampered by the lack of ready available input LCI data...|$|R
