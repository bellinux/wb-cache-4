25|$|This {{brings us}} back to Wittgenstein's {{reliance}} on indirect communication, and his reliance on thought-experiments. Some philosophical confusions come about because we aren't able to see family resemblances. We've made a mistake in understanding the vague and intuitive rules that language uses, and have thereby tied ourselves up in philosophical knots. He suggests that an attempt to untangle these knots requires more than simple deductive arguments pointing out the problems with some particular position. Instead, Wittgenstein's larger goal is to try to divert <b>us</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> philosophical problems long enough to become aware of our intuitive ability to see the family resemblances.|$|E
25|$|In the 13th lecture, Cyril of Jerusalem {{discusses}} the Crucifixion and burial of Jesus Christ. The main themes that Cyril focuses on in these lectures are Original sin and Jesus’ sacrificing himself to save <b>us</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> sins. Also, the burial and Resurrection which occurred {{three days later}} proving the divinity of Jesus Christ and the loving nature of the Father. Cyril was very adamant {{about the fact that}} Jesus went to his death with full knowledge and willingness. Not only did he go willingly but throughout the process he maintained his faith and forgave all those who betrayed him and engaged in his execution. Cyril writes “who did not sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth, who, when he was reviled, did not revile, when he suffered did not threaten”. This line by Cyril shows his belief in the selflessness of Jesus especially in this last final act of Love. The lecture also gives a sort of insight to what Jesus may have been feeling during the execution from the whippings and beatings, to the crown of thorns, to the nailing on the cross. Cyril intertwines the story with the messages Jesus told throughout his life before his execution relating to his final act. For example, Cyril writes “I gave my back to those who beat me and my cheeks to blows; and my face I did not shield from the shame of spitting”. This clearly reflects the teachings of Jesus to turn the other cheeks and not raising your hands against violence because violence just begets violence begets violence. The segment of the Catechesis really reflects the voice Cyril maintained in all of his writing. The writings always have the central message of the Bible; Cyril is not trying to add his own beliefs in reference to religious interpretation and remains grounded in true biblical teachings.|$|E
25|$|Kant then asks {{why we have}} {{to follow}} the {{principle}} of morality. He is forced to “admit that no interest impels me to do so”. He says that we clearly do “regard ourselves as free in acting and so to hold ourselves yet subject to certain laws” but wonders how this is possible. He then explains just how it is possible, by appealing to the two perspectives that we can consider ourselves under. According to Kant, human beings cannot know the ultimate structure of reality. Whilst humans experience the world as having three spatial dimensions and as being extended in time, we cannot say anything about how reality ultimately is, from a god's-eye perspective. From this god's-eye perspective the world may be nothing like the way it appears to human beings. We cannot get out of our heads and leave our human perspective on the world to know what it is like independently of our own viewpoint; we can only know about how the world appears to us, not about how the world is in itself. Kant calls the world as it appears to <b>us</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> point of view the world of sense or of appearances. The world from a god's-eye perspective is the world of things in themselves or the “world of understanding”. It is the distinction between these two perspectives that Kant appeals to in explaining how freedom is possible. Insofar as we take ourselves to be exercising our free will, Kant argues, we have to consider ourselves {{from the perspective of the}} world of understanding. It is only in the world of understanding that it makes sense to talk of free wills. In the world of appearances, everything is determined by physical laws, and there is no room for a free will to change the course of events. If you consider yourself as part of the world of appearances, then you cannot think of yourself as having a will that brings things about.|$|E

However, all three ships grounded on an uncharted sandbar, and the riggings of Actaeon and Sphinx became entangled in the process. The British managed to refloat Sphinx and Syren, but Acteon remained grounded, having moved too far onto the submerged sandbar. Consequently, none of these ships reached its intended position, a piece of good fortune not lost on Colonel Moultrie: [...] "Had these three ships effected their purpose, they would have enfiladed us in such a manner, as to have driven <b>us</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> guns." ...|$|E

[...] In his work The Trinity and the Kingdom of God, Jurgen Moltmann differentiated between what he called a [...] "fortuitous" [...] and a [...] "necessary" [...] Incarnation.

Moreover, it serves {{to tear down the}} iron wall that separates <b>us</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> Father in Heaven, as the wall of Jericho was encompassed [...] "and the wall fell down flat" [...] (Joshua 6:20).

2500|$|Joseph Luster of Otaku USA {{said that}} Tatsumi's art style and {{character}} designs reinforce {{the stories and}} that they linger in the reader's mind long after being read. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network found [...] "greater depth and variety" [...] than in The Push Man and Other Stories due to the larger amount of pages available, complimenting their simple layouts and executions, but disliked the endings {{as well as the}} repetitive character designs. Greg McElhatton of Read About Comics praised Tatsumi's characterization and found the stories to be memorable, but found fault in the same look of the characters. In a starred review, Publishers Weekly called the stories [...] "a bit more ambitious and sure-footed" [...] than those in The Push Man and Other Stories. Daryl Surat of the Anime World Order podcast felt that the longer stories in the manga allowed for more development than Tatsumi's earlier stories. Ng Suat Tong of The Hooded Utilitarian was critical of Tatsumi—feeling that the stories marked his transition into a rigorous artist, but disliking his repetitive themes and characters, concluding: [...] "These tales are neither close enough, true enough, sad enough nor vile enough to shock <b>us</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> modern stupor". In , Jason Thompson did not find the collection as powerful as The Push Man and Other Stories, but remarked that [...] "Tatsumi is a great storyteller and his pessimism is profound." [...] Dan Polley of Manga Life noted a departure by Tatsumi from his previous stories in The Push Man and Other Stories and called the stories [...] "Abandon the Old in Tokyo" [...] and [...] "Beloved Monkey" [...] the [...] "shining stars of the volume", concluding that his stories are timeless and have substance. Richard Rayner of the Los Angeles Times described the manga as [...] "remarkable, amazing", adding that [...] "the style is spare, elliptical and it's sometimes necessary to read two or three times to appreciate the full nightmarish power". Austin Ramzy of Time Magazine noted that the manga remains relevant, calling it [...] "a revealing time capsule and a strangely moving portrait of survival in a land where everything is changing". Kirkus Reviews felt that the strong illustrations made the manga relatable and that it did not feel dated. Gordon Flagg of Booklist said that Tatsumi's [...] "powerful drawing style depicts the characters with a starkness and simplicity that matches what is presented of their lives and conjures a convincing urban milieu through detailed backdrops".|$|E
