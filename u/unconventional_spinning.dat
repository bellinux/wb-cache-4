Three families of XY pyrochlores have emerged: Yb$_ 2 B_ 2 $O$_ 7 $, Er$_ 2 B_ 2 $O$_ 7 $, and, most recently, $AA'$Co$_ 2 $F$_ 7 $. In each case, the magnetic cation (either Yb, Er, or Co) exhibits XY anisotropy within the local pyrochlore coordinates, a consequence of crystal field effects. Materials in these families display rich phase behavior and are candidates for exotic ground states, such as quantum spin ice, and exotic ground state selection via order-by-disorder mechanisms.

Interestingly, the gap of elementary excitations remains finite throughout the transitions. The first spin liquid phase corresponds to the well known zero-flux state in the Heisenberg limit, which is stable with respect to small Kitaev couplings and develops 120 ^∘ order in the semi-classical limit at large S.
