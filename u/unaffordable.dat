5|$|Renovation of Kenilworth Road was {{neglected}} for {{the next}} two decades—financial difficulties and the club's ambitions to build a new ground meant that regeneration was <b>unaffordable,</b> and would also prove unnecessary should relocation occur. However, following the rejection of several potential sites for a new ground, the club finally turned their attentions back to the maintenance of Kenilworth Road. The first real modernisation of the ground came in 1973, with the first addition of seats at the stadium since the construction of the new Main Stand in 1922. The Bobbers Stand became all-seated, {{while the rest of the}} ground remained terracing. The new-look stand could only hold 1,539 seats, and as a result the capacity of the ground dropped to 22,601.|$|E
5|$|The average house {{price in}} Poole is high {{compared}} {{to the rest of}} the UK and the surrounding south west region. The average price of a property in Poole in 2008 was £274,011; detached houses were on average £374,150, semi-detached and terraced houses were cheaper at £226,465 and £217,128 respectively. An apartment or flat costs on average £216,097, more than any other part of Dorset. The average house prices in Poole are boosted by those in Sandbanks which had the fourth most expensive house prices in the world in 2000; in 2007 the average house price was £488,761. A study in 2006 by the National Housing Federation reported that Poole was the most <b>unaffordable</b> town in which to live in the UK.|$|E
5|$|While the Force 2020 {{plan has}} proven controversial, {{it appears to}} have been adopted by the East Timorese government. The plan was criticised by the United Nations and the governments of Australia and the United States as <b>unaffordable</b> and in excess of East Timor's needs. East Timorese President José Ramos-Horta defended the plan, however, arguing that its {{adoption}} will transform the F-FDTL into a professional force capable of defending East Timor's sovereignty and contributing to the nation's stability. East Timorese defence officials have also stressed that Force 2020 is a long-term plan and does not propose acquiring advanced weapons for some years.|$|E
5|$|A new Royal Commission {{into the}} defense of the Netherlands and NEI was held during 1920 and 1921. This Commission did not {{recommend}} that any battleships be constructed; instead it proposed that all ships under construction as at 31 December be completed along with a further two cruisers, 12 destroyers and 16 submarines. This plan was considered <b>unaffordable,</b> however, especially given the strength of the disarmament movement internationally. A Navy Bill to fund a reduced version of the Royal Commission's proposal was introduced to parliament in November 1921, but was eventually defeated by a single vote in October 1923. Renewed Dutch concerns over Japanese aggression in the late 1930s led to a proposal to build three Design 1047 battlecruisers for service in the NEI, but construction of these ships had not begun when the Netherlands was overrun by German forces in May 1940.|$|E
5|$|An {{extension}} to Camberwell from Elephant & Castle was planned and approved in 1931. Elephant & Castle was {{also to be}} reconstructed with a third platform to provide the additional reversing capacity, along with a new ticket hall and escalators. Due {{to the need to}} prioritise the extension from Baker Street to Finchley Road, to relieve congestion on the Metropolitan line, as well as financial constraints and the outbreak of the Second World War, no work was carried out on the extension. In the 1950s there was a brief revival of the plan, in which it was proposed that Elephant & Castle would not be altered and the additional turn-round capacity would be provided by making Camberwell a three-platform terminus. The project was ultimately <b>unaffordable</b> owing to post-war austerity, reduced demand, and the disproportionately high cost of the project with a three-platform deep-level terminus and the requirement for new trains and a depot.|$|E
5|$|Parsons {{graduated}} from University School in 1933, and moved {{with his mother}} and grandmother to a more modest house on St. John Avenue, where he continued to pursue his interests in literature and poetry. He enrolled in Pasadena Junior College with the hope of earning an associate degree in physics and chemistry, but dropped out after only a term because of his financial situation and took up permanent employment at the Hercules Powder Company. His employers then sent him to work at their manufacturing plant in Hercules, California on San Francisco Bay, where he earned a relatively high wage of $100 a month; he was plagued by headaches caused by exposure to nitroglycerin. He saved money in the hope of continuing his academic studies and began a degree in chemistry at Stanford University, but found the tuition fees <b>unaffordable</b> and returned to Pasadena.|$|E

25|$|The {{high price}} of salt made it <b>unaffordable</b> {{resulting}} {{in a number of}} diseases arising due to iodine deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Homelessness has {{increased}} {{rapidly in the}} past decade. Domestic violence, substance abuse, losing jobs, <b>unaffordable</b> rent and issues with family are significant contributing factors.|$|E
25|$|Vancouver is {{the most}} {{stressed}} in the spectrum of affordability of housing in Canada. In 2012, Vancouver was ranked by Demographia as the second-most <b>unaffordable</b> in the world, rated as even more severely <b>unaffordable</b> in 2012 than in 2011. The city has adopted various strategies to reduce housing costs, including cooperative housing, legalized secondary suites, increased density and smart growth. As of April 2010, the average two-level home in Vancouver sold for a record high of $987,500, compared with the Canadian average of $365,141.|$|E
25|$|A heroin (diamorphine) {{or other}} opiate/opioid addict may use codeine {{to ward off}} the effects of {{withdrawal}} during periods of time where their preferred drug is unavailable or <b>unaffordable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Shamubeel Eaqub, {{formerly}} a Principal Economist at the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research (NZIER), said that thirty years ago, an average house in New Zealand cost {{two or three}} times the average household income. House prices rose dramatically {{in the first years of}} the 21st century and by 2007, an average house cost more than six times household income. International surveys in 2013 showed that housing was <b>unaffordable</b> in all eight of New Zealand's major markets – <b>unaffordable</b> being defined by house prices which are more than three times the median regional income.|$|E
25|$|Causes {{could include}} mental illness, addiction, disenfranchised individuals, poor {{self-confidence}} and/or by individual freedom of choice. Another cause is temporary unemployment and or temporary <b>unaffordable</b> housing {{in a variety}} of geographical locations.|$|E
25|$|Melbourne has minimal {{public housing}} and high demand for rental housing, which is {{becoming}} <b>unaffordable</b> for some. Public housing is usually {{provided by the}} Housing Commission of Victoria, and operates {{within the framework of}} the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, by which federal and state governments provide housing funding.|$|E
25|$|Up to the 19th century, condoms were {{generally}} used {{only by the}} middle and upper classes. One reason for the lack of condom use was that the working classes tended to lack education on the dangers of sexually transmitted infections. Perhaps more importantly, condoms were <b>unaffordable</b> for many: for a typical prostitute, a single condom might cost several months' pay.|$|E
25|$|Chapter 58 {{had several}} key provisions: the {{creation}} of the Health Connector; the establishment of the subsidized Commonwealth Care Health Insurance Program; the employer Fair Share Contribution and Free Rider Surcharge; and a requirement that each individual must show evidence of coverage on their income tax return or face a tax penalty, unless coverage was deemed <b>unaffordable</b> by the Health Connector.|$|E
25|$|The {{chairman}} of the jury team then asked Silaban to show his design to Sukarno. However, Sukarno {{did not like the}} design as he wanted the monument to be {{in the form of a}} linga and yoni. Silaban was asked to design such a monument, but his design was for a monument so large that it would have been <b>unaffordable</b> given the economic conditions at the time.|$|E
25|$|From 1998 to 2006, {{internet}} {{was available in}} Tristan da Cunha but its high cost made it almost <b>unaffordable</b> for the local population, who primarily used it only to send email. The connection was also extremely unreliable, connecting through a 64 kbit/s satellite phone connection provided by Inmarsat. From 2006, a very-small-aperture terminal provided 3072 kbit/s of publicly accessible bandwidth via an internet cafe.|$|E
25|$|Despite the mid-20th century failure, {{the idea}} of underriver tunnels, which is relied on much {{advanced}} metro technologies, is still on Kiev city planner's table. Tunnel projects are recently being included in some of proposed Kiev development plans {{as a way to}} move the main traffic flows in the city center underground. However, most experts agree that such projects are both <b>unaffordable</b> and technically infeasible at this time.|$|E
25|$|UKIP is {{the only}} major {{political}} party in the United Kingdom that does not endorse renewable energy and lower carbon emissions, and its media output regularly promotes climate change denial. Farage and other senior UKIP figures have repeatedly spoken out against the construction of wind farms, deeming them a blot on the rural landscape. UKIP's media present renewable energy as inefficient and <b>unaffordable,</b> and they promote the use of fossil fuels, nuclear energy and fracking.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 an Extraordinary Tariff Adjustment {{was granted}} to all WSPs as an interim measure to assist WSPs {{to meet their}} {{operation}} and maintenance costs. Tariffs for sewerage services are part of tariff adjustments and {{the aim is to}} reach full cost recovery also for sanitation. The ministry responsible for water is, however, aware that full cost recovery tariffs for sewerage for certain systems would make the service provision <b>unaffordable</b> for many connected households.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years of the 21st century, the Amsterdam city centre has {{attracted}} large numbers of tourists: between 2012 and 2015, the annual number of visitors rose from 10 million to 17 million. Real estate prices have surged, and local shops are making way for tourist-oriented ones, making the centre <b>unaffordable</b> for the city's inhabitants. These developments have evoked comparisons with Venice, a city thought to be overwhelmed by the tourist influx.|$|E
25|$|People who ate {{the most}} subsidized food had a 37% {{higher risk of}} being obese {{compared}} to people who ate {{the least amount of}} subsidized food. This brings up the concern that minority communities are more prone to risks of obesity due to financial limitations. What the government subsidies results in those commodities being cheap to the public, however what is recommended by the dietary guidelines are foods that are made <b>unaffordable.</b>|$|E
25|$|In China, for instance, the {{collapse}} of the Cooperative Medical System left many of the rural poor uninsured and unable to access the resources necessary to maintain good health. Increases in the cost of medical treatment made healthcare increasingly <b>unaffordable</b> for these populations. This issue was further perpetuated by the rising income inequality in the Chinese population. Poor Chinese were often unable to undergo necessary hospitalization and failed to complete treatment regimens, resulting in poorer health outcomes.|$|E
25|$|In theory, in a {{free market}} the {{aggregates}} (sum of) of quantity demanded by buyers and quantity supplied by sellers may reach economic equilibrium over time in reaction to price changes; in practice, various issues may prevent equilibrium, and any equilibrium reached {{may not necessarily be}} morally equitable. For example, if the supply of healthcare services is limited by external factors, the equilibrium price may be <b>unaffordable</b> for many who desire it but cannot pay for it.|$|E
25|$|Housing in Port of Spain {{ranges from}} luxurious {{waterfront}} apartments to board houses lacking indoor plumbing and motor vehicular access. Continued pressure for expansion of commercial development in Woodbrook and uptown POS (Port of Spain proper) {{has led to}} a rapid rate of decline in the city's population over the past 4 decades. The private development scheme at Damien street Woodbrook recently provided 350 luxury-apartments, but those are <b>unaffordable</b> to most, even though they were originally intended for the general population.|$|E
25|$|Some {{oppose the}} {{marketing}} of infant formula, especially in developing countries. They are concerned that mothers who use formula will stop breastfeeding and become dependent upon substitutes that are <b>unaffordable</b> or less safe. Through efforts including the Nestlé boycott, they have advocated for bans on free samples of infant formula and for the adoption of pro-breastfeeding codes such as the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes by the World Health Assembly in 1981 and the Innocenti Declaration by WHO and UNICEF policy-makers in August 1990.|$|E
25|$|Lack of {{meaningful}} alternatives, such as affordable schools and quality education, according to ILO, is another major factor driving children to harmful labour. Children work {{because they have}} nothing better to do. Many communities, particularly rural areas where between 60–70% of child labour is prevalent, do not possess adequate school facilities. Even when schools are sometimes available, they are too far away, difficult to reach, <b>unaffordable</b> or {{the quality of education}} is so poor that parents wonder if going to school is really worth it.|$|E
25|$|The council {{commissioned}} Jacobs Engineering and Deloitte to {{look into}} the feasibility of underground trams, but in June 2005 the Birmingham Post reported that tunnelling would be <b>unaffordable</b> and not meet government funding criteria. Mr Whitby stated that he would challenge the way the studies had been carried out, but the eventual outcome was acceptance of a street tramway. By September 2008, the council's interest had shifted from the full BCCE to a shortened version between New Street and Snow Hill stations, which do not have connecting trains.|$|E
25|$|The flies {{also cause}} a huge {{economic}} problem in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. In these areas sun-drying {{is the major}} method of preserving fish, as ice is typically <b>unaffordable.</b> However, blowfly larvae tend to infect these sun-dried fish {{when the weather is}} warm and humid. In an experiment, 95% of the infecting flies were found to be C. megacephala. The flies can be controlled by using an odor that the flies are attracted to trap them. Insecticides are also used, although this results in the development of resistance.|$|E
25|$|Three years later, Miss Wooler {{offered her}} former pupil a {{position}} as her assistant. The family decided that Emily would accompany her to pursue studies that {{would otherwise have been}} <b>unaffordable.</b> Emily's fees were partly covered by Charlotte's salary. Emily was 17 {{and it was the first}} time she had left Haworth since leaving Cowan Bridge. On 29 July 1835, the sisters left for Roe Head. The same day, Branwell wrote a letter to the Royal Academy of Art in London, to present several of his drawings as part of his candidature as a probationary student.|$|E
25|$|The 79 AD {{eruption}} of Mount Vesuvius had a devastating {{effect on the}} Roman wine industry. Vineyards across the region and warehouses storing the recent 78 AD vintage were decimated, resulting in a dramatic shortage of wine. The damage to the trading port hindered the flow of wine from Rome's outlying provinces, aggravating its scarcity. Available wine rose sharply in price, making it <b>unaffordable</b> to {{all but the most}} affluent. The wine famine caused panicking Romans to hurriedly plant vineyards in the areas near Rome, {{to such an extent that}} grain fields were uprooted in favor of grapevines.|$|E
25|$|A {{substantial}} {{percentage of}} the US homeless population are individuals who are chronically unemployed or have difficulty managing their lives effectively due to prolonged and severe drug and/or alcohol abuse. Substance abuse can cause homelessness from behavioral patterns associated with addiction that alienate an addicted individual's family and friends who could otherwise provide support during difficult economic times. Increased wealth disparity and income inequality causes distortions {{in the housing market}} that push rent burdens higher, making housing <b>unaffordable.</b> Dr. Paul Koegel of RAND Corporation, a seminal researcher in first generation homelessness studies and beyond, divided the causes of homelessness into structural aspects and then individual vulnerabilities.|$|E
25|$|Socioeconomic {{status is}} both a strong {{predictor}} of health, and a key factor underlying health inequities across populations. Poor socioeconomic status {{has the capacity to}} profoundly limit the capabilities of an individual or population, manifesting itself through deficiencies in both financial and social capital. It is clear how a lack of financial capital can compromise the capacity to maintain good health. In the UK, prior to the institution of the NHS reforms in the early 2000s, it was shown that income was an important determinant of access to healthcare resources. Maintenance of good health through the utilization of proper healthcare resources can be quite costly and therefore <b>unaffordable</b> to certain populations.|$|E
25|$|At {{this early}} stage the Caledonian Railway saw itself as the future creator of an {{extensive}} network in Scotland, and it set about gaining control of as many other railways as possible. It did so not by purchasing them, but by leasing them. This had the advantage that no payment was required at first, only a periodical payment much later. The Caledonian negotiated with the SCR, the SMJR and the Aberdeen Railway and believed it had captured them, but the SCR had other ideas. Much later the Caledonian found that the periodical lease payments were <b>unaffordable,</b> and it was rescued by the legal opinion that the lease agreements had been ultra vires.|$|E
25|$|Local food {{shortages}} {{can be caused}} by a lack of arable land, adverse weather, lower farming skills such as crop rotation, or by a lack of technology or resources needed for the higher yields found in modern agriculture, such as fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation, machinery and storage facilities. As a result of widespread poverty, farmers cannot afford or governments cannot provide the resources necessary to improve local yields. The World Bank and some wealthy donor countries also press nations that depend on aid to cut or eliminate subsidized agricultural inputs such as fertilizer, in the name of free market policies even as the United States and Europe extensively subsidized their own farmers. Many, if not most, farmers cannot afford fertilizer at market prices, leading to low agricultural production and wages and high, <b>unaffordable</b> food prices.|$|E
