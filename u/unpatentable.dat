25|$|In {{relation}} to Macrossan's patent application, {{it was held}} that the subject matter was <b>unpatentable</b> {{on the grounds of}} the computer program and business method exclusions. However, in {{relation to}} the mental act exclusion, the Court of Appeal made no specific finding.|$|E
25|$|Macrossan then {{appealed to}} the High Court. The High Court concurred in finding that the {{application}} related to a computer program as such, and to a method for performing a mental act as such and was <b>unpatentable</b> for each of those two reasons. However, the High Court specifically overruled the UKPO hearing officer {{on one of the}} three grounds of exclusion, by holding that the application did not relate to a method of doing business as such.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{cases such as}} Hotel Security Checking Co. v. Lorraine Co., 160 F. 467 (2d Cir. 1908), which held that a {{bookkeeping}} system to prevent embezzlement by waiters was <b>unpatentable,</b> were often read to imply a [...] "business method exception", in which business methods are <b>unpatentable.</b> Another such case was Joseph E. Seagram & Sons v. Marzell, 180 F.2d 26 (D.C. Cir. 1950), in which {{the court held that}} a patent on “blind testing” whiskey blends for consumer preferences would be “a serious restraint upon the advance of science and industry” and therefore should be refused.|$|E
2500|$|... {{took one}} more step towards the {{abolition}} of patents on software inventions.

2500|$|The court moderated that {{assertion}} {{by agreeing}} {{that not all}} patent applications involving formulas are patent-ineligible by saying, [...] "Yet it is equally clear that a process is not <b>unpatentable</b> simply because it contains a law of nature or a mathematical algorithm." [...] Patents involving formulas, laws of nature, or abstract principles are eligible for patent protection if {{the implementation of the}} principle is novel and unobvious—unlike this case, in which it was conceded that the implementation was conventional. Accordingly, in Flook's case, there was no [...] "other inventive concept in its application", and thus no eligibility for a patent.|$|E
2500|$|However, AT foolishly deleted from Campbell's {{proposed}} {{patent application}} all {{the tables and}} graphs detailing the exact value of inductance {{that would be required}} before the patent was submitted. [...] Since Pupin's patent contained a (less accurate) formula, AT was open to claims of incomplete disclosure. [...] Fearing that there was a risk that the battle would end with the invention being declared <b>unpatentable</b> due to Heaviside's prior publication, they decided to desist from the challenge and buy an option on Pupin's patent for a yearly fee so that AT would control both patents. [...] By January 1901 Pupin had been paid $200,000 ($13 million in 2011) and by 1917, when the AT monopoly ended and payments ceased, he had received a total of $455,000 ($25 million in 2011).|$|E
2500|$|In 1931, John Haven Emerson (February 5, 1906February 4, 1997) {{introduced}} and improved upon {{a less expensive}} iron lung. The Emerson iron lung had a bed that could slide {{in and out of}} the cylinder as needed, and the tank had portal windows which allowed attendants to reach in and adjust limbs, sheets, or hot packs. Drinker and Harvard University sued Emerson, claiming he had infringed on patent rights. Emerson defended himself by making the case that such lifesaving devices should be freely available to all. Emerson also demonstrated that every aspect of Drinker's patents had been published or used by others at earlier times. [...] Since an invention must be novel to be patentable, prior publication/use of the invention meant it was not novel and therefore <b>unpatentable.</b> Emerson won the case, and Drinker's patents were declared invalid.|$|E
2500|$|This last {{aspect of}} the Quanta opinion {{is very similar to}} the {{doctrine}} of the Lincoln Engineering case, a doctrine that the Federal Circuit had previously held to be no longer authoritative. Under the Supreme Court's Lincoln Engineering doctrine, the combination of a newly invented device with a known, conventional device with which the new device cooperates in the conventional and predictable way in which devices of those types have previously cooperated is <b>unpatentable</b> as an “exhausted combination” or “old combination.” Thus, when the Quanta Court said that “everything inventive about each patent is embodied in” the licensed Intel products, which “embody the essential features of the [...] patents," [...] the Court was, in effect, saying that the combination of a novel Intel microprocessor in a conventional manner with an old personal computer is an exhausted combination. Accordingly, no weight would be put on the fact that separate patents had issued to LGE on the inventive device and on the old combination that included it.|$|E
2500|$|Physicians John R. Lee and Jonathan Wright were {{pioneers in}} the area of BHRT. Lee {{authored}} several popular books on BHRT and promoted custom-compounded BHRT, with the goal of achieving what he called a [...] "natural hormone balance". [...] He based this goal on the clinical testing of saliva to establish where [...] "deficiencies" [...] existed, though agencies such as the FDA and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists state that blood and saliva testing is unreliable and biologically meaningless. [...] Lee also believed that progesterone acted as a panacea and general health tonic for many health conditions; he based his claims on anecdotal data rather than peer-reviewed research, and there have been no clinical trials demonstrating this to be true. [...] Wright also authored a popular book on BHRT; he promoted a triple-estrogen formula he called [...] "Triest", which combined the most common three estrogens (of over 25 types) found in human females: estriol, estradiol and estrone. Previous bioidential formulas had used only estradiol. [...] This triple formula was based on a single unpublished study whose conclusions did not take into account how estrogens are processed and excreted in the bodyparticularly how the liver processes oral estrogens, converting most of them to estrone. [...] No followup was performed by Wright to replicate these observations. [...] Wright may have been the first proponent of BHRT to use the term [...] "bioidentical"the word he coined to describe <b>unpatentable,</b> plant-derived molecules he believed were identical to human hormones. [...] However, no structural crystallographic evidence has been used to support the idea that these molecules are actually identical to endogenous human hormones. [...] When the Women's Health Initiative's reports on the unappreciated risks of equine estrogens were released, many prescribers of BHRT used Wright's assertions (and his terminology) to proclaim the superiority of bioidentical molecules despite a lack of scientifically supported evidence. [...] Following the publication of a popular book written by actress Suzanne Somers in 2006, the term [...] "bioidentical" [...] gained more prominence in popular consciousness as a [...] "poorly understood new adjective" [...] regarding hormone replacement therapy.|$|E
50|$|The patent {{examiner}} rejected this invention as <b>unpatentable</b> subject matter under 35 U.S.C. 101. He {{argued that the}} steps performed by the computer were <b>unpatentable</b> as a computer program under Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U.S. 63 (1972). The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences of the USPTO affirmed the rejection. The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals (CCPA), the predecessor to the current Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, reversed, noting that an otherwise patentable invention did not become <b>unpatentable</b> simply because a computer was involved.|$|E
5000|$|The court {{called the}} {{correlation}} between the naturally-produced metabolites and therapeutic efficacy and toxicity to be an <b>unpatentable</b> [...] "natural law" [...] and found the first two steps to be not [...] "genuine applications of those lawsbut rather ... drafting efforts designed to monopolize the correlations." [...] The court said, [...] "Because methods for making such determinations were well known in the art, this step simply tells doctors to engage in well-understood, routine, conventional activity previously engaged in by scientists in the field. Such activity is normally not sufficient to transform an <b>unpatentable</b> law of nature into a patent-eligible application of such a law." [...] A commentator on the ruling wrote: [...] "The conclusion here is that (1) a newly discovered law of nature is itself <b>unpatentable</b> and (2) the application of that newly discovered law is also normally <b>unpatentable</b> if the application merely relies upon elements already known in the art." ...|$|E

5000|$|The disputing {{point was}} whether Claim 3 and Claim 2 are patent-eligible.

[...] The decision also found that comparisons of DNA sequences involved in these patents are abstract mental processes under the recent In re Bilski decision, therefore also not patent eligible, and that the drug screening claims were <b>unpatentable</b> as they merely cover a [...] "basic scientific principle".|$|E
5000|$|On June 28, 2010, the United States Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Bilski v.

5000|$|In March 2010, {{a federal}} {{district}} court judge in the Southern District of New York ruled against Myriad Genetics and {{in favor of the}} American Civil Liberties Union that purified DNA sequences and the inventions using them are <b>unpatentable.</b> As has been discussed, Judge Sweet relied entirely upon Supreme Court precedent and ignored contrary case law of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals to conclude that isolated DNA is of the same fundamental quality as natural DNA and is thus <b>unpatentable</b> under section 101 of the Patent Act; and that the method claims of the patents were abstract mental processes that were also <b>unpatentable.</b> His rationale was controversial and his ruling was appealed to the Federal Circuit. The appeal court reversed the ruling deciding that isolated DNA had a [...] "markedly different chemical structure" [...] from other human genetic material. In 2013 The US Supreme Court partly reversed the decision again deciding that DNA was not patentable, Justice Antonin Scalia writing [...] "the portion of the DNA isolated from its natural state sought to be patented is identical to that portion of the DNA in its natural state".
