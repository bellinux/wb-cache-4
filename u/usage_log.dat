40|$|Web <b>usage</b> <b>log</b> files {{generated}} on web servers contain {{huge amount of}} {{information that can be}} used for discovering web usage association rules, which can potentially give useful knowledge to the web usage data analysts. Association rule over-generation is a common problem in association rule mining that is further aggravated in web <b>usage</b> <b>log</b> mining due to the interconnectedness of web pages through the website link structure. We implemented a system for the discovery of association rules in web log usage data as an ob-ject-oriented application and used it to experiment on a real life web <b>usage</b> <b>log</b> data set. We proposed to alleviate the problem of web usage association rule over-generation by pruning the rules that contain directly linked pages out of the rule set. Our experiments showed that inter-estingness measures can successfully be used to sort the discovered association rules after the pruning method was applied. Most of the rules that ranked highly according to the interestingness measures proved to be truly valuable to a web master. We compared confidence and lift interestingness measures and found that lift outperformed con-fidence, but only after the minimum confidence threshold was taken into account...|$|E

Modeling temporal dynamics in user behavior is not trivial, and {{it is challenging to}} study its effect in order to provide better recommendation results to users. To incorporate temporal effects into information filtering systems, we analyze a large sized real-world <b>usage</b> <b>log</b> data gathered from Bugs Music, {{which is one of the}} well-known online music service in Korea, and study temporal dynamics in users ’ music listening behaviors considering periodicity of time dimension and popularity change. We insist that the result of our analysis can be a useful guideline to the industry which delivers music items to users and tries to consider {{temporal context}} in their recommendations.

40|$|Background: The {{impact of}} {{scientific}} publications {{has traditionally been}} {{expressed in terms of}} citation counts. However, scientific activity has moved online over the past decade. To better capture scientific impact in the digital era, a variety of new impact measures has been proposed on the basis of social network analysis and <b>usage</b> <b>log</b> data. Here we investigate how these new measures relate to each other, and how accurately and completely they express scientific impact. Methodology: We performed a principal component analysis of the rankings produced by 39 existing and proposed measures of scholarly impact that were calculated on the basis of both citation and <b>usage</b> <b>log</b> data. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the notion of scientific impact is a multi-dimensional construct that can not be adequately measured by any single indicator, although some measures are more suitable than others. The commonly used citation Impact Factor is not positioned at the core of this construct, but at its periphery, and should thus be used with caution...|$|E

It becomes important for researchers, smartphone designers, and application developers to know how users use apps on their smartphones. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present our work where data mining is applied to smartphone app <b>usage</b> <b>log</b> data with a focus on data preparation. The methods include association rule mining and sequential pattern mining. The results are the discovered rules and patterns that reflect users ’ real-life app-using behaviors; they can lead to improved user interfaces, and they can also be used to reconstruct the context in which a user used his or her smartphone. We demonstrate an application of data mining that can have an impact on the smartphone industry, and we also demonstrate a data-driven approach that can help us know more about how users use apps on their smartphones.

Web content is semantically annotated using a conceptual hierarchy (taxonomy).

The proposed approach first constructs a user behavior model, called personal Web usage lattice, from Web <b>usage</b> <b>logs</b> using the fuzzy formal concept analysis technique. Based on the personal Web usage lattice, resources that the user is most probably interested in during a given period can be deduced efficiently.

30|$|This {{study has}} taken an {{opportunistic}} sensing approach for real-life behavior observation, as human subjects {{are also part of}} the sensing infrastructure. For billing purposes, telecom operators keep records of their mobile phone customers’ <b>usage</b> <b>logs.</b> Each of these <b>usage</b> <b>logs,</b> also known as Call Detail Records (CDRs), includes a caller ID, callee ID, caller’s connected cell tower ID, callee’s connected cell tower ID, duration of the call, and timestamp. Each time the mobile phone user makes or receives a call, i.e., connecting to a cell tower, the nearest cell tower location is recorded. Thus, collectively CDR data provides fine-grained longitudinal information about the individual’s mobility and sociality. In this study, we capitalized on the opportunity that this kind of data can provide such a detailed behavior observation concerning mobility and sociality. We used anonymized CDR data of mobile phone users in Portugal over the period of one year.|$|R

Novel methods of web service composition are being proposed in the literature include Semantics-based composition, WSDLbased composition.

40|$|Purpose: Despite {{widespread}} use of mobile technology in medical education, medical students’ use of mobile technology for clinical decision support and learning is not well understood. Three key questions were explored in this extensive mixed methods study: 1) how medical students used mobile technology {{in the care of}} patients, 2) the mobile applications (apps) used and 3) how expertise and time spent changed overtime. Methods: This year-long (July 2012 –June 2013) mixed methods study explored the use of the iPad, using four data collection instruments: 1) beginning and end-of-year questionnaires, 2) iPad <b>usage</b> <b>logs,</b> 3) weekly rounding observations, and 4) weekly medical student interviews. Descriptive statistics were generated for the questionnaires and apps reported in the <b>usage</b> <b>logs.</b> The iPad <b>usage</b> <b>logs,</b> observation logs, and weekly interviews were analyzed via inductive thematic analysis. Results: Students predominantly used mobile technology to obtain real-time patient data via the electronic health record (EHR), to access medical knowledge resources for learning, and to inform patient care. The top four apps used were Epocrates®, PDF Expert®, VisualDx®, and Micromedex®. The majority of students indicated that their use (71 %) and expertise (75 %) using mobile technology grew overtime. Conclusions: This mixed methods study provides substantial evidence that medical students used mobile technology for clinical decision support and learning. Integrating its use into the medical student's daily workflow was essential for achieving these outcomes. Developing expertise in using mobile technology and various apps was critical for effective and efficient support of real-time clinical decisions...|$|R
