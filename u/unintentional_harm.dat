2500|$|Psychiatry has an {{insensitive}} {{history in}} the area of BDSM. There have been many involvements by institutions of political power to marginalize subgroups and sexual minorities. Mental health professionals {{have a long history of}} holding negative assumptions and stereotypes about the BDSM community. Beginning with the DSM-II, Sexual Sadism and Sexual Masochism have been listed as sexually deviant behaviours. Sadism and masochism were also found in the personality disorder section. This negative assumption has not changed significantly which is evident in the continued inclusion of Sexual Sadism and Sexual Masochism as paraphilias in the DSM-IV-TR. The DSM-V, however, has depathologized the language around paraphilias in a way that signifies [...] "the APA's intent to not demand treatment for healthy consenting adult sexual expression". These biases and misinformation can result in pathologizing and <b>unintentional</b> <b>harm</b> to clients who identify as sadists and/or masochists and medical professionals who have been trained under older editions of the DSM can be slow to change in their ways of clinical practice.|$|E
2500|$|Offences {{against people}} and {{property}} were primarily settled by the offender paying compensation to the victims. Although any such offence required compensation, the law made {{a distinction between}} intentional and <b>unintentional</b> <b>harm,</b> and between murder and manslaughter. If an offender did not pay outright, his property was seized until he did so. Should the offender be unable to pay, his family {{would be responsible for}} doing so. Should the family be unable or unwilling to pay, responsibility would broaden to the wider kin-group. Hence, {{it has been argued that}} [...] "the people were their own police". Acts of violence were generally settled by payment of compensation known as an éraic fine; the Gaelic equivalent of the Welsh galanas and the Germanic weregild. If a free person was murdered, the éraic was equal to 21 cows, regardless of the victim's rank in society. Each member of the murder victim's agnatic kin-group received a payment based on their closeness to the victim, their status, and so forth. There were separate payments for the kin-group of the victim's mother, and for the victim's foster-kin.|$|E

40|$|A {{fascinating}} {{aspect of}} Epstein 2 ̆ 7 s scholarly work is his {{exploration of the}} apparent tension between libertarian principles and utilitarian thought—an exploration that comes alive in his casebook. To Epstein, these two competing principles often coalesce to yield a single 2 ̆ 2 correct 2 ̆ 2 answer to a problem. In other words, the answer that arises from a desire to protect a pre-determined set of individual rights-for example, private property rights, or the right of personal autonomy often produces an outcome that is also beneficial to the overall common good. Some scholars have critiqued Epstein 2 ̆ 7 s work by suggesting {{that there is more}} disharmony than harmony in the relationship between the libertarian and utilitarian approaches. Who has the better argument on the point, however, is not relevant for present purposes. What is relevant is that Epstein introduces, confronts, and explores the potential for tension between the two approaches throughout his casebook in a way that provokes thoughtful and interesting classroom discussion. A second, and closely related, theme that Epstein explores in his casebook is the overwhelming importance of the older, historic common law cases to the study of torts. In fact, the book devotes almost seventy pages to the age-old debate over whether negligence or strict liability should govern <b>unintentional</b> <b>harms.</b> This historical approach reinforces Epstein 2 ̆ 7 s emphasis on the libertarian/utilitarian divide; indeed, the strict liability versus negligence debate roughly parallels the libertarian/utilitarian tension, with strict liability generally (although not necessarily) associated with the former and negligence generally (although not necessarily) associated with the latter. This historical grounding also gives students a basis for understanding why negligence governs some <b>unintentional</b> <b>harms</b> while strict liability governs others, and provides them with the tools to challenge the current boundaries between the two theories. Finally, a more historical approach to tort law gives students some sense of the expansion and contraction of tort liability over time-an understanding that puts 2 ̆ 2 tort reform 2 ̆ 2 in context...|$|R
40|$|Since the two {{landmark}} {{publications in}} moral psychology (Greene, Sommerville, Nystrom, Darley, & Cohen, 2001; Haidt, 2001), {{the field has}} experienced an affective revolution that has put emotions {{at the center of}} the stage. Although work on exploring role of emotions in assessing morality of various types of moral acts (impure, unfair, etc.; Haidt, 2007) abounds, studying its role in harmful behaviors presents a unique challenge. The aversion to harming others is an integral part of the foundations of human moral sense and it presents itself in the form of deeply ingrained moral intuitions (Haidt, 2007). Since creating laboratory situations to investigate harm aversion raises ethical issues, research has primarily relied on studying hypothetical cases. In the current thesis, we utilize hypothetical vignettes to explore role of emotions in both moral judgment and behavior in harmful contexts, both when harm is carried out intentionally or produced accidentally. Study 1 investigates the role of emotion in motivating utilitarian behavior in moral dilemmas when presented in contextually salient virtual reality format as compared to judgment about the same cases for their textual versions. Study 2 investigates divergent contributions of two different sources of affect, one stemming from self-focused distress and the other focused on other-oriented concern, on utilitarian moral judgments in autistics. Study 3 investigates the role of empathic arousal in condemning agents involved in <b>unintentional</b> <b>harms</b> and why harmful outcomes have a greater bearing on blame as compared to acceptability judgments...|$|R

40|$|My {{thesis is}} that the concept and {{practice}} of repair, properly understood and circumscribed, can serve to: (1) specify a responsibility to care for individuals who are cognitively dependent on particular configurations of technologies and suffer cognitively significant harms following damage to various technologies, and (2) {{to act as a}} standard by which to regulate the design, implementation, and selection of technologies available for human use and appropriation. I begin (Chapters One and Two) by providing a critical investigation of the concept and practice of repair. In Chapters Three and Four, I set forth a proposal to consider what I term 2 ̆ 2 cognitive-agentic repair 2 ̆ 2 as the mindful mending of agentic skills/autonomy competency by way of those constitutive cognitive processes that are extended/situated in objects and arrangements of objects that constitute particular material spaces and places (home, workplace). As such, I argue that when either intentional or <b>unintentional</b> <b>harms</b> are committed against individuals who are cognitively situated in the world, there is a prima facie responsibility to attempt the specific act of cognitive-agentic repair so as to support the possibility of personal autonomy. To justify this ethical responsibility, I advance an account of human persons that is grounded in both feminist philosophy and recent work in the cognitive sciences on the hypotheses of extended and embedded cognition. I then move to consider how my account of repair can constructively inform the design, implementation, and selection of particular technologies by acting as a regulative standard. This analysis is divided into two parts: (1) a theoretical construction that utilizes work in the philosophy of technology to distinguish the pattern of those technologies that would facilitate cognitive-agentic repair (Chapter Five) and (2) a practical application to telemedical/telehealth technologies (Chapter Six) ...|$|R
40|$|There are {{concerns}} {{about the potential for}} <b>unintentional</b> <b>harms</b> when clinical practice guidelines are applied to patients with multimorbidity. The objective was to summarize the evidence regarding the effect(s) of comorbidity on the outcomes of medication for an index chronic condition. A systematic review was conducted of studies published in MEDLINE and Cochrane Trials before May 2012. The search strategy was constructed to identify articles indexed with "comorbidity" or a related term or by a given condition and one or more additional specified comorbid conditions. The search yielded 3252 articles, of which 37 passed the title/abstract screening process, and 22 were included after full-text review. An additional 23 articles were identified by screening the reference lists for included articles. Information was extracted on study design; population; therapy; comparison groups; outcome(s); main findings. Indexing of articles was inconsistent, with no term for "multimorbidity," and rare use of "comorbidity". Only one article examined the effects of comorbidity per se, finding no benefit of tight control of DM among persons with high comorbidity, defined using a comorbidity index. The remainder examined pairs of conditions, the majority of which were post-hoc analyses of randomized controlled trials and which found no difference in outcomes according to whether a comorbid condition was present. Several demonstrated no difference or an increased risk of adverse outcome among persons with DM and tight control of HTN as compared to usual control. Several demonstrated lack of benefit of statins among persons with end-stage renal disease. There is limited evidence regarding the effects of multiple comorbidities on treatment outcomes. The majority of studies demonstrated no effect of a single comorbid condition on outcomes. Additional studies examining a broad range of comorbidity are required, along with clear and consistent indexing to allow for improved synthesis of the evidence...|$|R

40|$|This Article argues that, to {{make their}} vision of justice a reality, egalitarians need to change both their focus and their tactics with respect to {{criminal}} law. The tragedy of contemporary criminal justice is not that individual rights are too narrowly construed, but that those living in disadvantaged communities are injured both by crime and counter-productive law enforcement. The remedies that egalitarians have historically looked to - remedies articulated {{within the framework of}} individual rights - are poorly suited to address the systematic reproduction of inequality that results. First, egalitarians will need to shift their focus from the racially motivated harms directed at individual criminal offenders and defendants to the collateral and often <b>unintentional</b> <b>harms</b> borne by non-criminals in their communities. Second, as a matter of pragmatic reform, egalitarians should shift their focus from the doctrine of individual liberties to more modest policy reforms aimed at increasing the influence that citizens in disadvantaged communities exercise over the form of justice itself. For too long, these communities have been asked to choose between expansive readings of criminal rights or oppressively harsh criminal sanctions - either choice making them a party to their own subordination. As a remedy, I argue for an approach coordinated across the political branches, an approach that seeks to make both criminals and the criminal justice system more responsive to the practical concerns of the citizenry. I review empirical data indicating that the public is eager for reforms that do both, and I outline a modest reform to leverage this popular preference, a form of jury polling that elicits greater information about the popular preferences as a regular part of criminal jury trials. This kind of reform, I argue systematically (and respectfully) elicits greater information about and draws attention to the complex needs of those living in our nation 2 ̆ 7 s most vulnerable neighborhoods...|$|R

Sheps Center for Health Services Research, 8 School of Nursing, The University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA Background: The {{emerging}} dual {{imperatives of}} personalized medicine and technologic advances make population screening for preventable conditions resulting from genetic alterations a realistic possibility. Lynch syndrome {{is a potential}} screening target due to its prevalence, penetrance, {{and the availability of}} well-established, preventive interventions. However, while population screening may lower incidence of preventable conditions, implementation without evidence may lead to <b>unintentional</b> <b>harms.</b> We examined the literature to determine whether evidence exists that screening for Lynch-associated mismatch repair (MMR) gene mutations leads to improved overall survival, cancer-specific survival, or quality of life. Documenting evidence and gaps is critical to implementing genomic approaches in public health and guiding future research. Materials and methods: Our 2014 – 2015 systematic review identified studies comparing screening with no screening in the general population, and controlled studies assessing analytic validity of targeted next-generation sequencing, and benefits or harms of interventions or screening. We conducted meta-analyses for the association between early or more frequent colonoscopies and health outcomes. Results: Twelve studies met our eligibility criteria. No adequate evidence directly addressed the main question or the harms of screening in the general population. Meta-analyses found relative reductions of 68 % for colorectal cancer incidence (relative risk: 0. 32, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 23 – 0. 43, three cohort studies, 590 participants) and 78 % for all-cause mortality (relative risk: 0. 22, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 09 – 0. 56, three cohort studies, 590  participants) for early or more frequent colonoscopies among family members of people with cancer who also had an associated MMR gene mutation. Conclusion: Inadequate evidence exists examining harms and benefits of population-based screening for Lynch syndrome. Lack of evidence highlights the need for data that directly compare benefits and harms.

40|$|Alcohol {{is one of}} the world’s top {{priority}} public health areas and one of the main risk factors for non-communicable diseases. Even though only half the world's population drinks alcohol, it is the world's fifth leading cause of ill health and premature death. In western Europe it is the sixth leading risk factor and in eastern Europe it is the number one risk factor. The WHO European region remains the area of the world with the highest levels of alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm. From 2008 to 2010, the European average for recorded alcohol consumption for adults (≥ 15 years) was 10. 9 L of pure alcohol. Although this represents a 10 per cent decline from 2003 - 2005, in some areas of Europe, consumption is increasing. Most alcohol is drunk in heavy drinking occasions, which worsens all risks. In particular, heavy drinking sessions are a cause of all types of intentional and unintentional injuries, and of ischaemic heart disease, cancers and sudden death. Alcohol harms people other than the drinker, whether through violence on the street, domestic violence in the family, or simply using up government resources, notably through the costs of providing healthcare and dealing with crime and disorder. The real absolute risk of dying from an adverse alcohol related condition increases with the total amount of alcohol consumed over a lifetime. For many conditions, including alcohol-related cancers, the risk is increased at even low levels of consumption, and, according to the international agency on research on cancer, there is no threshold for the effect of alcohol - the risk starts from any level of consumption above zero. Taking into account a life-course view, exposure to alcohol during pregnancy can impair the brain development of the foetus and is associated with intellectual deficits that become apparent later in childhood. The adolescent brain is particularly susceptible to alcohol and the longer the onset of consumption is delayed, the less likely it is that problems and alcohol dependence will emerge in adult life. Alcohol is also an intoxicant affecting a wide range of structures and processes in the central nervous system which - interacting with personality characteristics, associated behaviour and sociocultural expectations - are causal factors for intentional and <b>unintentional</b> injuries, <b>harm</b> to people other than the drinker and drink-driving fatalities [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|Objective. Social {{psychological}} {{research has}} indicated that intentional harm may be perceived as causing greater damage than <b>unintentional</b> <b>harm.</b> It has been proposed that this harm magnification is a consequence of a need to blame, condemn and punish ("blame motivation"). The objective of the current study was to replicate these findings and to test whether such judgements about harmful events are associated with the level of an individual's paranoia. Method. Three hundred adults read a scenario in which a head of a company causes a reduction in employees' pay. Participants were randomly allocated to versions in which the outcome of the executive's action was intended or unintended. Ratings were made of intent, harm caused and blame motivation. Participants also completed assessments of paranoia and anxiety. Results. Intentional harm was judged as causing worse outcomes than <b>unintentional</b> <b>harm,</b> explaining a small amount of variance in harm scores. Paranoia moderated judgements of intent and blame motivation but not the degree of harm caused; high paranoia, relative to low paranoia, was associated with the unintentional scenario generating higher attributions of intent and blame and the intentional scenario generating lower attributions of intent and blame. Anxiety levels did not affect judgements. Conclusions. The study supports the theory that there is a reasoning bias that magnifies the consequences of intentional harm relative to <b>unintentional</b> <b>harm.</b> In the initial judgement about intent, people with paranoia are less accurate in their use of contextual information...|$|E

I conclude that we ought to reject the nonreciprocity principle as a moral basis of liability to compensate. The results of the critique are not purely negative, however. In outlining and assessing the relevance of avoidability and benefit distributions, I make some progress towards a new account of liability to compensate for <b>unintentional</b> <b>harm...</b>|$|E

Gathering information within a participatory framework recognizing children’s views contributes to protection of their rights. Extra precautions, however, are needed to protect children because of the vulnerabilities associated with their developmental needs. Using case studies of ethical challenges faced by program implementers and sociobehavioral researchers, this article explores ways in which data collection activities among children may affect their rights. We suggest ways in which rightsbased principles {{may be used to}} derive safeguards to protect against <b>unintentional</b> <b>harm</b> and abuses, based on a multidisciplinary consultation with researchers and service providers. Les responsables de programme et les chercheurs favorisant le droit des enfants à la santé, à l’éducation et à un niveau de vie adéquat obtiennen...|$|E

Increasingly, these services rely on software-intensive systems, e. g. medical health informatics and air traffic control, for improving the different aspects of industrial practice, e. g. enhancing efficiency through automation and safety through smart alarm systems. However, many services are categorised as high risk and as such {{it is vital to}} analyse {{the ways in which the}} software-based systems can contribute to <b>unintentional</b> <b>harm</b> and potentially compromise safety. This thesis defines an approach to modelling and analysing Service-Oriented Architectures (SOAs) used in the safety-critical domain, with emphasis on identifying and classifying potential hazardous behaviour. The approach also provides a systematic and reusable basis for defining how the safety case for these SOAs can be developed in a modular manner. The approach is tool-supported and is evaluated through two case studies, from the healthcare and oil and gas domains, and industrial review...|$|E
