2500|$|As the car {{took over}} American life after World War II, the downtown, which already was facing {{problems}} {{due to a}} drop in expendable income, was largely vacated as business moved to suburban shopping malls.

Others had their top floors removed to reduce tax bills and many facades were [...] "modernized" [...] destroying the Victorian character of the downtown. Road widening and other improvements destroyed a row of business next to city hall, {{as well as the}} area that has become the Lord Overpass.

6000|$|Now it is {{a curious}} thing that none of our writers on art seem to have noticed the great {{principle}} of nature in this respect. They all talk of deep shadow as a thing that may be given in quantity,--one fourth of the picture, or, in certain effects, much more. Barry, for instance, says {{that the practice of}} the great painters, who [...] "best understood the effects of chiaroscuro," [...] was, for the most part, to make the mass of middle tint larger than the light, and the mass of dark larger than the masses of light and middle tint together, i.e., occupying more than one-half of the picture. Now I do not know what we are to suppose is meant by [...] "understanding chiaroscuro." [...] If it means being able to manufacture agreeable patterns in the shape of pyramids, and crosses, and zigzags, into which arms and legs are to be persuaded, and passion and motion arranged, for the promotion and encouragement of the cant of criticism, such a principle may be productive of the most advantageous results. But if it means, being acquainted with the deep, perpetual, systematic, <b>unintrusive</b> simplicity and unwearied variety of nature's chiaroscuro--if it means the perception that blackness and sublimity are not synonymous, and that space and light may possibly be coadjutors--then no man, who ever advocated or dreamed of such a principle, is anything more than a novice, blunderer and trickster in chiaroscuro. And my firm belief is, that though color is inveighed against by all artists, as the great Circe of art--the great transformer of mind into sensuality--no fondness for it, no study of it, is half so great a peril and stumbling-block to the young student, as the admiration he hears bestowed on such artificial, false, and juggling chiaroscuro, and the instruction he receives, based on such principles as that given us by Fuseli--that [...] "mere natural light and shade, however separately or individually true, is not always legitimate chiaroscuro in art." [...] It may not always be agreeable to a sophisticated, unfeeling, and perverted mind; but the student had better throw up his art at once, than proceed on the conviction that any other can ever be legitimate. I believe I shall be perfectly well able to prove, in following parts of the work, that [...] "mere natural light and shade" [...] is the only fit and faithful attendant of the highest art; and that all tricks--all visible, intended arrangement--all extended shadows and narrow lights--everything in fact, in the least degree artificial, or tending to make the mind dwell upon light and shade as such, is an injury, instead of an aid, to conceptions of high ideal dignity. I believe I shall be able also to show, that nature manages her chiaroscuro a great deal more neatly and cleverly than people fancy;--that [...] "mere natural light and shade" [...] is a very much finer thing than most artists can put together, and that none think they can improve upon it but those who never understood it.|$|E

5000|$|The plot {{received}} mixed comments. Douglass C. Perry of IGN {{found the}} plot {{to be less}} [...] "endearing" [...] than Undergrounds, and while he enjoyed the story mode's gameplay, other staff at IGN did not, opting instead for the Classic mode. A reviewer from GameSpot enjoyed the story mode, but felt it was too short. In contrast, Tom Bramwell from Eurogamer felt {{there were plenty of}} levels, and saw the plot as enjoyable and <b>unintrusive,</b> if unintelligent. Ben Silverman of Game Revolution also thought the campaign was noticeably short, but also that [...] "that's actually a blessing, though, because the plot and cut-scenes are pretty lame." [...] Perry enjoyed the level design, but noted some slowdown in the levels due to their size.|$|E
5000|$|The most noted {{divergence}} is {{a structural}} change: {{there is no}} duel in the original story, nor is there a character such as Johann. The [...] "unknown woman" [...] from the book never marries, but lives off a series of lovers who remain unnamed and mostly <b>unintrusive.</b> Because of this, the protagonist's actions offend no one in particular. In the film, Brand is challenged to a duel, which he initially plans to ditch. The finale reveals the contestant to be Johann, who demands satisfaction over Lisa's affair. Having read Lisa's letter, Brand boldly accepts the duel and walks into it, his fate uncertain. This redeeming action has no literary equivalent. In fact, Brand's literary equivalent can only faintly recall Lisa after reading the letter, and there's no significant event past this.|$|E
5000|$|The {{flat-rate}} tax {{was changed to}} a variable rate, dependent on the property value, in 1778. People who were exempt from paying church or poor rates, for reasons of poverty, were exempt from the window tax. Window tax was relatively <b>unintrusive</b> and easy to assess. Manchester Royal Infirmary had to pay a tax of 1/9d per window on {{the windows of the}} rooms occupied by staff of the infirmary in 1841 - a total of £1 9/9d. [...] Certain rooms, particularly dairies, cheeserooms and milkhouses were exempt providing they were clearly labelled, and {{it is not uncommon to}} find the name of such rooms carved on the lintel. The bigger the house, the more windows it was likely to have, and the more tax the occupants would pay. Nevertheless, the tax was unpopular, because it was seen by some as a tax on [...] "light and air".|$|E

5000|$|Keith M. Booker {{states that}} Beyond a Reasonable Doubt is [...] "perhaps the bleakest of his Lang's American noir films". Dennis L. White {{describes}} {{the film as}} having [...] "considerable impact, due {{not so much to}} visual style, but as to the narrative structure and mood and to the expertly devised plot, in which the turnabout is both surprising and convincing." [...] Stella Bruzzi, author of Men's Cinema: Masculinity and Mise-en-Scene in Hollywood, felt that the film plot was [...] "overly schematic" [...] and [...] "motivated by a paradox", affecting [...] "an invisible, transparent style while, at the same time, being all about surface and performance". She adds that Lang [...] "deploys an ostentatiously <b>unintrusive</b> 'classical' style", which he [...] "purposefully reduces down to its minimalist bare necessities". Writer James McKay notes that Fontaine as Susan Spencer is [...] "a little bit more forward than we normally expect, in a role that requires her to do all the running where her man's concerned".|$|E

However, it also introduces a desynchronization of the client and server game states, which needs to be handled to keep the game playable. Usually, the desync is corrected when the client receives the updated game state, but as instantaneous correction would lead to [...] "snapping", there are usually some [...] "smoothing" [...] algorithms involved. For example, one common smoothing algorithm would be to check each visible objects client-side location {{to see if it}} is within some error epsilon of its server-side location. If not, the client-sides information is updated to the server-side directly (snapped because of too much desynchronization). However, if the client-side location is not too far, a new position between the client-side and server-side is interpolated; this position is set to be within some small step delta from the client-side location, which is generally judged to be [...] "small enough" [...] to be <b>unintrusive</b> to the user.|$|E
5000|$|Initially, no {{sponsors}} or advertising {{existed for}} Ballen's radio talk show, the same being true later for his TV show Getaway. Ballen seized on this market opportunity, starting {{his own company}} in China to identify and attract global brands seeking to reach emerging millennial Chinese consumers, and white collar university graduates. Ballen is an advocate of content-marketing and <b>unintrusive,</b> digital ad messaging. He developed disruptive, touch-based mechanisms that do not annoy or disturb digital consumers' viewing experience, providing consumers with greater opportunity, and clients with increased levels of eCRM data, and downstream monetization. Ballen frequently addresses the topic of interactive content-marketing and in 2014 coined the term [...] "Audience ROI". His mechanisms promote audience choice in ad messaging, enabling organic insight into audience preference; these insights are based contextually on what consumers themselves see, like, and then touch inside digital content they view.

Metal Rules's El Cid criticized mainly the crowd writing that [...] "the Japanese crowd doesn't help much in this matter, no offense {{to anyone but}} it does seem like everyone is just sitting down listening and doing nothing else during a gig unless they are instructed to by Johan Liiva" [...] and stated that the album [...] "is very much like listening to a compilation of Arch Enemy songs rather than a live album." [...] On the other hand, Paul Schwarz of Chronicles of Chaos wrote in his review that it [...] "has a clear yet characteristic sound which places it in the rare category of being a live album well worth owning. The musical elements have a live-sounding rawness while retaining the subtleties which are such essential parts of Arch Enemy's masterful mixture of pure riff and metal melodies". He praised Liiva writing that his [...] "vocal delivery is both powerful and expressive - and similarly well-balanced and accentuated by the top-notch production."

5000|$|Rural tenancy {{refers to}} a type of {{sharecropping}} or tenancy arrangement that a landowner can use to make full use of property he may not otherwise {{be able to develop}} properly. A [...] "tenant" [...] or non-landowner will take residency on the property of the landowner and work the land in exchange for giving the landowner a percentage of the profits from the eventual crop. Tenancy can be <b>unintrusive</b> (where the tenant provides home, transportation, tools, seed, etc.) in which case the landowner gives the tenant {{a large portion of the}} profits or it can be intrusive (where the landowner provides home, food, tools, seed, etc. on credit) in which case the landowner will keep most or even all of the profits. The term [...] "rural tenancy" [...] usually describes the situation of previously enslaved people that were now tenants on the landowner's property. The landowner would extend the farmer shelter, food, and necessary items on credit to be repaid out of the tenant's share of the crop. The farmer could, if he desired, charge the tenant extremely high interest on the advanced pay since there were no lending laws applicable to migrant or tenant workers at the time. This could ultimately result in the tenant owing the landlord more money than his share of the crop at harvest and forcing the farmer to be further indentured to the landowner. This practice was used frequently by landowners in the South after slavery was abolished. Modern day tenancy is much more highly regulated and these practices are less common.|$|E
5000|$|The Copyright Act of 1909 {{was meant}} to be a {{complete}} rewrite and overhaul of existing copyright law. As originally proposed in the draft of the bill, copyright protection required putting the word [...] "copyright" [...] or a sanctioned abbreviation on the work of art itself. This included paintings, the argument being that the frame was detachable. In conference sessions among copyright stakeholders on the proposed bill, conducted in 1905 and 1906, representatives of artist organizations objected to this requirement, wishing to put no more on the work itself than the artist's name. As a compromise, the possibility was created to add a relatively <b>unintrusive</b> mark, the capital letter C within a circle, to appear on the work itself next to the artist's name, indicating the existence of a more elaborate copyright notice elsewhere that was still to be allowed to be placed on the mounting. Indeed, the version of the bill that was submitted to Congress in 1906, compiled by the Copyright Commission under the direction of the Librarian of Congress, Herbert Putnam, contained a provision that a special copyright symbol, the letter C inclosed within a circle, could be used instead of the word [...] "copyright" [...] or the abbreviation [...] "copr.", but only for a limited category of copyrightable works, including works of art but not ordinary books or periodicals. The formulation of the 1909 Act was left unchanged when it was incorporated in 1946 as title 17 of the United States Code; when that title was amended in 1954, the symbol © was allowed as an alternative to [...] "Copyright" [...] or [...] "Copr." [...] in all copyright notices.|$|E

In his review in the October 1945 issue of Filmindia, Patel wrote that {{though it was not}} the best picture from New Theatres, {{it was one of the}} best in recent times (circa 1940s). Bimal Roy, an unknown director at the time, was lauded for using a new cast of characters for the film, who managed to leave [...] "behind vivid impressions". He singled out the lead characters for their performances stating, [...] "Radhamohan's stoic restraint, his <b>unintrusive</b> culture and his spiritual identification with the role that he plays, give his portrayal the requisite dramatic intensity needed for the theme. Radhamohan has given a remarkable performance", while [...] "Binota is an artiste of very high calibre. All the while, she knows what she is doing and she acquits herself with suitable dignity and poise through numerous situations". The film was praised for its dialogues, [...] "The most brilliant feature of the picture is its dialogue". Roy's direction was hailed as [...] "The direction of Bimal Roy is an excellent beginning to his new profession". Patel continued with his positive critique by stating, [...] "There is no pseudo-Russian technique about it nor any Hollywood glamour shots. And yet, not a single shot was badly taken throughout the picture". His negative comments about the film were that [...] "it dragged in the first three reels", and that though [...] ""Hamrahi" [...] propagates its theme beautifully", it did so by focusing on just a handful of people to highlight the poor-rich situation thus losing [...] "its universal appeal".|$|E

In conjunction with a 4, 6 -O-benzylidene protecting group {{and the use of}} the sulfoxide glycosylation method, 3 -O-naphthylpropargyl protected mannosyl donors are extremely β-selective. The apposite use of protecting groups continues to be an essential element in preparative carbohydrate and oligosaccharide synthesis, with considerable effort devoted to their development in recent years. 1 This is due to the central role of protecting groups in modulating reactivity of both glycosyl donors and acceptors, and critically, in the control of regioselectivity, 2 and stereoselectivity. 3 In response to a problem arising from the influence of protecting groups size on the stereoselectivity of a glycosylation reaction, 4 we recently described the successful application of propargyl ethers as sterically <b>unintrusive</b> donor protecting groups for β-mannosylation. 5 However, while the propargyl ethers were readily introduced, and had the anticipated effect on stereoselectivity, they required a two step deprotection protocol: an initial treatment with base followed by catalytic osmoylation of th...|$|E

Inexpensive and <b>unintrusive</b> passive RFID tags {{can be easily}} at-tached to or interweaved into user clothes. The tag readings in an RFID-enabled environment can then be used to recognize the user gestures in order to enable intuitive human-computer interaction. People can interact with large public dis-plays without the need to carry a dedicated device, which can improve interactive advertisement in public places. In this paper, multiple hypotheses tracking is used to track the motion patterns of passive RFID tags.
