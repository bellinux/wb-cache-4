40|$|The need {{to value}} complex options {{containing}} reload features {{is becoming increasingly}} more common as such options become more proliferate. Traditionally, two types of valuation methods have been used: the intrinsic method and closed-form models, such as Black-Scholes. These methodologies <b>undervalue</b> <b>options</b> with reload features, a fact recently recognized by both accounting regulators and some courts which have sanctioned the use of binomial/lattice methodology. Such undervaluation can be costly to clients in litigation such as divorce cases. This study analyzes these alternative methodologies and reveals the extent of such undervaluation when the Black-Scholes method is used. It also provides evidence of {{the sensitivity of the}} resulting value to various assumptions required by binomial/lattice models. ...|$|R

Drawing on ‘managerial power’ theory, the study posits that managers have incentives to limit disclosures to the lowest level possible without causing significant stakeholder outrage, The {{study examines}} also the relation between the extent to which firms underprice the disclosed value of options (ie relative to a computed benchmark) and factors that are known to influence option valuation. The results show that Australian companies underprice executive stock option disclosures in annual reports, which is consistent with US evidence that provides similar findings. The results suggest also the possibility that Australian firms manipulate the Black-Scholes (BS) valuation model opportunistically to <b>undervalue</b> <b>options</b> issued to directors and the top five executives. Size, leverage, firm age and profitability are found to be significant factors in explaining option underpricing. Further, the smaller the value of stock option remuneration in proportion to market capitalisation, the higher the undervaluation of stock options. As well as opportunism, this latter finding is consistent with less familiarity and expertise in valuing these instruments when option...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an improved model, based on historical data, {{that describes the}} returns on assets that result from R&D efforts to assist managers {{of public and private}} R&D activities. Such a model may lead to better decision support tools to monetize the value that may be extracted from R&D, which is otherwise often <b>undervalued.</b> Real <b>option</b> pricing models are used to gauge appropriate funding levels for assets such as R&D projects that contain large time-dependent uncertainties. However, this study finds that assuming the Gaussian distribution describes fluctuations in value is not appropriate for assets whose value is derived from R&D activities. This conclusion is based on a study of 43 military R&D projects and 100 technology-intensive small firms. A power law, such as the Cauchy distribution, is shown to be more accurate in describing fluctuations in returns from R&D investments...|$|R
40|$|Pricing {{options on}} known-dividend-paying stocks has {{traditionally}} been solved by assuming that the stock price minus {{the present value of}} dividends follows the lognormal diffusion. The same assumption is also popular in tree methods to avoid combinatorial explosion. Unfortunately, this assumption <b>undervalues</b> the <b>option</b> since the volatility of the underlying stock price is underestimated. The biases can be significant especially when the volatility of the stock price or the dividend payout is large. Our paper does away with this assumption with a new recombining tree, the stair tree. The stair tree is guaranteed to converge to the lognormal price process of the known-dividend-paying stock. Thus option pricing can be solved efficiently and without bias. Numerical examples verify the algorithm’s superior performance to existing methods. Besides, the stair tree can be extended so the dividends depend on the stock prices in arbitrary ways. This extension makes our model more realistic and flexible...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I {{develop an}} option {{valuation}} framework that explicitly incorporates a product life cycle. I {{then use the}} framework to value the real option to change a project's capacity. Standard techniques for valuing real options typically ignore product life cycle models and specify instead a constant expected growth rate for demand or price. I show that this specification can lead to significant error in the valuation of capacity options. In particular, the standard technique tends to <b>undervalue</b> the <b>option</b> to contract capacity and overvalue the option to expand capacity. This result {{has important implications for}} capital investment decisions, especially in high-technology industries that feature regular introductions of newly improved products.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the role of}} self-set, non-binding goals {{as a source of}} internal motivation to attenuate the self-control problem of a hyperbolic discounter. Agents have linear reference-dependent preferences and endogenously set a goal that serves as the reference point. They face an infinite horizon, optimal stopping problem in continuous time, where there exists an option value of waiting due to uncertainty. I show that, regardless of whether the agent is sophisticated or naive about his presentbiasedness, goal-setting attenuates the hyperbolic agent’s tendency to <b>undervalue</b> this <b>option</b> and stop too early, but too much reference dependence leads an agent to wait longer than the first best. In particular, reference dependence is strictly worse for a time consistent agent. Notably, none of the effects of goalsetting require any form of loss aversion. The model extends to social comparisons, in which each agent measures his outcome against his expectation of his peer’s outcome. In a heterogeneous group where agents have differing degrees of self-control, comparison to increasingly patient peers induces increasingly patient behavior. Nonetheless, every agent prefers to compare himself to a peer with the lowest degree of self-control possible, regardless of the severity of his own self-control problem. ∗ I would like to thank my adviser, Roland Bénabou, for guidance and encouragement.

40|$|The term 2 ̆ 2 cheap stock 2 ̆ 2 {{describes}} <b>undervalued</b> stock <b>options</b> {{granted to}} CEOs {{and other key}} employees prior to initial public offerings (IPOs). Pre-IPO firms have incentives to issue cheap stock as compensation because it results in lower compensation expense on the income statement and in large cash windfalls to CEOs subsequent to the IPO. Because cheap stock results in an overstatement of earnings, the Securities and Exchange Commission frequently challenges the valuations of these grants, which makes cheap stock a key accounting issue in many IPOs. Using a sample of firms that completed IPOs between 2004 and 2007, I investigate the effect of corporate governance structures, outside monitors, and other factors {{on the level of}} cheap stock grants. My results suggest that higher-quality governance structures, specifically audit committee accounting experts and more independent boards, constrain the level of cheap stock granted to CEOs. I also find that when CEOs have a stronger intrinsic commitment to the firm and when firms receive independent stock valuations on option grant dates, CEOs receive lower levels of cheap stock. Greater levels of cheap stock are granted when directors receive pre-IPO stock options and when CEOs are hired in the two-year period before the IPO. Additionally, I find a negative relation between CEO cheap stock and future firm operating and stock return performance. Overall, my results illustrate the importance of corporate governance structures in IPO firms and suggest that greater levels of cheap stock are an indication of agency problems, which in turn, adversely affect shareholder value...|$|R
40|$|Stock option {{accounting}} {{is an area}} {{in financial}} statements that requires substantial estimates and management discretion. Previous {{research in the area}} of stock option accounting has found that valuations of options and subsequent accounting methods have been incorrectly stated to aid a company to look financially stronger. Companies that are about to undergo an initial public offering have the most incentive to incorrectly state the value of their options. However, all of these studies have used financial data from financial statements dated before 2004. This is significant because FASB Standard 123 (R) (2004) and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2000) have both been put into practice since most of the data has been analyzed. Both of these could have significant influence on the way that stock option accounting is completed for public companies. This study seeks to examine financial data from after the issuance of FASB Standard 123 (R) and Sarbanes- Oxley to determine if manipulation and undervaluation of options is present. The data will be examined to determine if there is a change from before an initial public offering and after an offering. If companies have continued to <b>undervalue</b> the <b>options,</b> the overall stock based compensation expense will be understated and therefore companies could appear to have a higher net income figure. The study is comprised of financial statement analysis of three companies that went public in 2011 : Jive Software Inc, LinkedIn, and the Zillow Group. There are gaps in the financial reporting of companies, which leave room for further investigation. The three companies did show evidence of undervaluation, but a larger study would be needed for statistically conclusive proof...|$|R
40|$|The Black-Scholes-Merton formula {{has been}} put to {{widespread}} use by options traders because it provides a means of calculating the theoretically 'correct' price of stock options. Traders can therefore see whether the market price of stock <b>options</b> <b>undervalues</b> or overvalues them compared with their hypothetical Black-Scholes-Merton price, before choosing {{to buy or sell}} options accordingly. As a consequence of this close relationship between options pricing theory and options pricing practice, a strong performativity loop was activated, whereby market prices quickly converged on the hypothetical Black-Scholes-Merton prices following the dissemination of the formula. The theory has therefore had significant real-world effects, but how should we characterize the initial instinct to derive the theory from a philosophy of science perspective? The two books under review suggest that a Kuhnian reading of the advancement of scientific knowledge might well be the most appropriate. But, on closer inspection, it becomes clear that the publication of the Black-Scholes-Merton formula should not be seen as a Kuhnian moment with paradigm-shaping attributes. It is shown that, at most, the formula acts as an important exemplar which, via its use in the training of options pricing theorists and options pricing practitioners, reinforces the entrenchment of finance theory within the orthodox economics worldview...|$|R
40|$|Real {{option and}} dynamic asset {{valuation}} techniques are becoming established as standard methods for evaluating investment {{decisions that are}} subject to quantifiable uncertainty. This has been particularly the case in natural resources industries. In the UK oil industry there is renewed interest in oilfield valuation techniques - the 22 nd UK Offshore Licensing Round was held in 2004 {{with a total of}} 97 licences offered to 58 companies in 2004, of which 15 were new entrants to the UK Continental Shelf. Many firms involved in these bid processes now routinely use dynamic modelling and real option valuation to assess oilfield value premiums in differing operating and taxation enviroments. Literature on PV and real option valuation is clear that models should accommodate tax effects but is unclear about its universal treatment in dynamic models. We examine the impact of the North Sea oil industry’s tax regime on the valuation of shelf real options by using a sample of forty oil fields that for the period 1970 to 2001 had initial estimated reserves greater than 75 million barrels of oil. Our sample uses Wood Mackenzie primary source field data updated quarterly by analysts using bottom up field research. Our findings are that the tax enviroment of itself will cause asymmetrical movements in both free cash flow models and option values. These results are of interest to both academics and practitioners in that that tax {{plays an important role in}} the valuation process of real options in the oil and gas sector. Our results show that North Sea valuation models that treat taxation as a deterministic function systematically overstate DCF valuation results, understate volatility estimates and <b>undervalue</b> real <b>options.</b> Specifically our analysis suggests that failure to incorporate the variable nature of tax into the valuation process leads to an 18 percent over valuation of asset PV and an under valuation of the option price by 19. 5 percent. The increased usage of real option techniques in assessing oil field bids highlights the need for valuation models to incorporate the country specific nature of tax terms. This is especially important for oil fields in the North Sea where field exploration block bidding interest remains high and the legacy of tax changes is long; demanding from financiers a new way of assessing bid values in the face of future cash flow uncertainty.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the suitability of}} four widely used real estate price indices (the S&P Case-Shiller Index; the FHFA index; the NCREIF NPI; and the historical NAREIT series) for valuing and monitoring the credit risk of U. S. mortgages. Our evaluation focuses on four properties of these indexes: unbiased estimation of the drift of real estate price dynamics; unbiased estimation of the volatility of real estate price dynamics; suitability for measuring correlation between interest rates and real estate prices; suitability for measuring growth dynamics, or the effects of real options components of real estate values. We find, despite their widespread use, that these indices generate downwardly biased estimates of the idiosyncratic volatility of prices around the index and, thus systematically <b>undervalue</b> embedded default <b>options</b> in mortgage products. We also identify other specific properties, or required assumptions underlying the construction of these indices, {{that are likely to}} be problematic for mortgage pricing. These properties include the fact that none of these indices adequately address the index number problem for real estate assets. These price metrics thus mix price and quantity dynamics in non-transparent ways leading to likely biases in the measurement of the correlation between real estate "prices" and economic fundamentals, such as interest rates, and expected skewness in real estate price distributions arising from the real option components of real estate values. Overall, this analysis suggests {{there is a need to}} re-evaluate the use of these indices for mortgage risk management and to develop dynamic hedonic price indices that both address the index number problem and allow for flexible specifications for price and quantity dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In {{spite of}} {{consistent}} scientific {{documentation of the}} beneficial effects of exercise training programs in coronary artery disease (CAD), exercise training is a remarkably underutilized (1) and probably also <b>undervalued</b> treatment <b>option.</b> CAD is an inflammatory disorder linking inflammation in the vessel wall to endothelial dysfunction and progression of disease (2). The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the effects of a high-intensity interval training program on the late luminal loss and the associated risk of restenosis, plasma levels of inflammatory markers, endothelial function and the cardiac autonomic nervous system. Further, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can be regarded as a model for mechanical induced plaque rupture. An additionally objective was therefore the evaluation of the inflammatory response to PCI reflected by plasma levels of numerous inflammatory mediators. Methods: Subjects: Forty consecutive patients were included after successful PCI with stent implantation in one or several native coronary arteries because of angina pectoris. Patients were randomly assigned to an organized training program for 6 months or to usual care. Exercise Training: A high-intensity interval group training for 60 minutes three times a week was used, starting 11 ± 4 days after PCI. Individual pulse watches allowed the patients to monitor their heart rate and exercise intensity during training. Quantitative coronary angiography: At 6 months follow-up, coronary reangiography with repetition of identical angiographic projections of the lesion was performed. A validated computer-assisted edge-detection algorithm was used to measure late luminal loss defined as the minimal lumen diameter immediately after the procedure minus the minimal lumen diameter at 6 months follow-up. Exercise Testing: Symptom-limited ergospirometry was performed on an upright, electrically braked cycle ergometer using a 20 Watt/minute ramp protocol. The patients were asked to exercise to exhaustion. Gas exchange data were collected continuously with an automated breath-bybreath system. Endothelial Function: Endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent dilation of the brachial artery was measured using a 12 -MHz ultrasound Doppler probe according to current guidelines (3). Inflammatory markers: High-sensitivity CRP concentrations were measured by a particle-enhanced immunoturbidimetric method with the use of Roche Modular P automated clinical chemistry analysers (Roche Diagnostics). Plasma concentrations of interleukin-(IL) - 6, IL- 10, pentraxin 3 (PTX 3), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) - 1, E-selectin, Pselectin, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP) - 1 /CCL 2, regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES/CCL 5), CCL 19, CCL 21, IL- 8 /CXCL 8 and CXCL 16 were quantified by enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Plasma concentrations of von Willebrand factor (vWF) were analyzed by EIA using antibodies from DakoCytomation (Glostrup, Denmark). Plasma concentrations of CD 40 ligand (CD 40 L) were analyzed by EIA provided by Bender MedSystems GmbH (Vienna, Austria). Heart Rate Variability: Heart rate variability (HRV) measures were obtained from a 3 -channel portable Holter (Schiller MT- 200, Switzerland) worn for 24 hours. The MT- 210 Analysis Software Version 1. 0. 0 (Schiller) was used to analyse time and frequency domain measures of HRV. Results: At six months in-stent restenosis, measured as in-segment late luminal loss of the stented coronary area, was significant smaller in the training group compared to the control group. This effect was associated with a significant increased peak oxygen uptake and improved brachial artery reactivity in the training group only. In the training group all time domain indices and the frequency domain indices, total power and ultralow frequency of HRV, increased significantly during the training period, while mean heart rate decreased significantly. In the control group only one time domain measure index increased significantly. Plasma levels of CRP and PTX 3 showed a significantly early increase after PCI peaking at 3 days and 3 hours, respectively. VCAM- 1 increased significantly with a peak at 3 days, while E-selectin showed a significant gradual decrease. Markers of platelet mediated inflammation showed increasing (CD 40 ligand) and decreasing (P-selectin) levels after PCI. While plasma levels of MCP, CCL 21 and CXCL 16 increased rapidly in response to PCI, IL- 8, CCL 19 and RANTES decreased. At 6 months, levels of the inflammatory markers CRP, IL- 6 and IL- 8 were significantly reduced and levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 10 were significantly increased in the training group only. The changes of CRP and IL- 6 from baseline to 6 months were significantly correlated to late luminal loss in the stented segment at 6 months. In contrast to these anti-inflammatory effects, training had no effect on markers of platelet-mediated inflammation, and the effect of training on markers on endothelial cell activation were rather complex showing attenuating (vWF) and enhancing (E-selectin and VCAM- 1) effects. Conclusion Regular high-intensity interval exercise training over 6 months resulted in a significant reduction in late luminal loss in the stented coronary segment after PCI for angina pectoris. This effect was associated with increased aerobic capacity, improved endothelium function and improved heart rate variability. PCI induced a complex response of plasma levels of inflammatory markers and cytokines during the first week post-PCI. Regular exercise training in non-acute stable angina patients following PCI may attenuate some, but not all inflammatory pathways, potentially contributing to the beneficial effects of exercise training on restenosis...|$|R
