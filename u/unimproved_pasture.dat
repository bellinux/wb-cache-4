40|$|The {{impact of}} local land-use {{practices}} on {{the transfer of}} carbon from land to small headwater streams is understudied {{despite the fact that}} it has the most pronounced impact on stream carbon at these scales. We measured the stream water concentration, δ 13 C, and Δ 14 C of dissolved organic carbon [DOC], particulate organic carbon [POC], and dissolved inorganic carbon [DIC] in temperate headwater streams. The streams drained a forested, <b>unimproved</b> <b>pasture,</b> large and small mixed land-use, and tilled and no-till corn watershed in Coshocton, Ohio in the fall, spring, and summer and during a winter and spring storm event. Annual carbon fluxes of DOC and POC were greatest in the tilled corn watershed than in all other watershed types. Stream δ 13 C-DOC values indicate that this carbon pool was mainly derived from the present overlying vegetation. Δ 14 C-DOC was all modern suggesting vegetative root exudates contributing to the DOC pool. Δ 13 C-POC values indicate that this carbon pool was derived from a mixture of C 3 vegetation and soil organic matter in the non-corn watersheds, and C 4 vegetation in both corn watersheds. Δ 14 C-POC values indicate that in the non-corn watersheds, this carbon pool was derived from a mixture of modern overlying vegetation and deeper pre-agricultural soil. Cor...|$|E
40|$|The {{concentration}} of Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) {{is often used}} {{as an indicator of}} soil condition and soil health. To be useful as an indicator, SOC must be considered in context, with soil type, climatic region, local rainfall, slope, and land use history influencing measured amounts of SOC. The concept of Percent Projected Natural Vegetation Soil Carbon (PNVSC) implicitly incorporates these context variables. Percent PNVSC is defined as a simple percentage comparing the contemporary measured soil carbon against a hypothetical amount of soil carbon that would be observed in the local landscape today, if the areas under managed agroecosystems remained under natural vegetation (which in this study is dry sclerophyll forest). The term ‘natural’ used in the PNVSC concept approximates with the natural system prior to agrarian settlement. Percent PNVSC was calculated for a 22, 000 ha sub-catchment of the Hunter Valley, Australia and it showed a spatially weighted average of 73, indicating substantial soil carbon loss as a result of cumulative land use change over more than 100 years. The Percent PNVSC map highlights changes in soil carbon distribution across the landscape with mid-slope positions lower in the catchment showing the greatest loss of soil carbon. Viticulture has resulted in half of the original SOC being lost, compared to a 75 % PNVSC for <b>unimproved</b> <b>pasture</b> and an 83 % PNVSC for improved pasture. Average soil carbon loss due to mixed land-use change in this sub-catchment is 13, 331 kg C/ha. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland...|$|E
40|$|Purebred Menz, first-cross Awassi x Menz, and first-cross Corriedale x Menz lambs {{were born}} and reared {{together}} under common environmental and management conditions. Before they reached six months of age, animals of each sex in each genotype were allocated to two treatment groups. Both groups grazed together on <b>unimproved</b> <b>pasture</b> {{during the day and}} at night only one group was given supplementary feed. The two treatments were maintained until yearling age. However, because ewe lambs were joined early with fertile rams and began to lamb at 12 months of age, treatment effects for ewes were assessed from body weight taken at 315 days of age to avoid confounding with increasing conceptus weight during late pregnancy. Supplementary feeding significantly increased both male and female body weights and yearling wool production in all genotypes. Mean ewe body weights at 315 days of age for unsupplemented crosses were: 15. 8 kg Menz, 18. 3 kg Awassi, and 17. 8 kg Corriedale. The values for the supplemented crosses were: 20. 7 kg Menz, 27. 7 kg Awassi, and 26. 2 kg Corriedale. The mean yearling weights for unsupplemented rams were: 17. 5 kg Menz, 21. 3 kg Awassi, and 20. 5 kg Corriedale. The values for the supplemented rams were: 25. 8 kg Menz, 37. 5 kg Awassi, and 35. 0 kg Crriedale. Average yearling wool weights for unsuplemented animals of both sexes were: 0. 65 kg Menz, 0. 85 kg Awassi and 1. 07 kg Corriedale. The wool weights for supplemented groups were: 0. 75 kg Menz, 1. 21 kg Awassi, and 1. 36 kg corriedale. Treatment and genotype interactions were highly significant for all measurements, which shows that differences in productivity between indigenous and crossbred genotypes were greater under supplemented than unsupplemented conditions. These results illustrate the necessity of providing extra inputs for crossbred genotypes to get the full benefit of their greater production potential...|$|E

40|$|Myriad {{studies have}} shown the extent of human {{alteration}} to global biogeochemical cycles. Yet, {{there is only a}} limited understanding of the influence that humans have over silicate weathering fluxes; fluxes that have regulated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and global climate over geologic timescales. Natural landscapes have been reshaped into agricultural ones to meet food needs for growing world populations. These processes modify soil properties, alter hydrology, affect erosion, and consequently impact water-soil-rock interactions such as chemical weathering. Dissolved silica (DSi), Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, NO 3 −, and total alkalinity were measured in water samples collected from five small (0. 65 to 38. 3 ha) gauged watersheds at the North Appalachian Experimental Watershed (NAEW) near Coshocton, Ohio, USA. The sampled watersheds in this unglaciated region include: a forested site (70 + yr stand), mixed agricultural use (corn, forest, pasture), an <b>unimproved</b> <b>pasture,</b> tilled corn, and a recently (− 1 a − 1) were similar to the median of annual averages between 1979 – 2009 for the much larger Ohio-Tennessee River Basin (25. 6 kg ha − 1 a − 1). Corn watersheds, which only had surface runoff, had substantially lower DSi yields (− 1 a − 1) than the perennial-flow watersheds. The lack of contributions from Si-enriched groundwater largely explained their much lower DSi yields with respect to sites having baseflow. A significant positive correlation between the molar ratio of (Ca 2 + + Mg 2) /alkalinity to DSi in the tilled corn and the forested site suggested, however, that silicate minerals weathered as alkalinity was lost via enhanced nitrification resulting from fertilizer additions to the corn watershed and from leaf litter decomposition in the forest. This same relation was observed in the Ohio-Tennessee River Basin where dominant landuse types include both agricultural lands receiving nitrogenous fertilizers and forests. Greater gains in DSi with respect to alkalinity losses in the Ohio-Tennessee River Basin than in the NAEW sites suggested that soils derived from younger Pleistocene glacial-till may yield more DSi relative to nitrogenous fertilizer applications than the older NAEW soils. Because silicate weathering occurs via acids released from nitrification, CO 2 consumption estimates {{based on the assumption that}} silicate weathers via carbonic-acid alone may be especially over-estimated in fertilized agricultural watersheds with little baseflow (i. e. 67 % overestimated in the corn till watershed). CO 2 consumption estimates based on silicate weathering may be as much as an average of 8 % lower than estimates derived from carbonic acid weathering alone for the Ohio-Tennessee River Basin between 1979 – 2009...|$|E

The grazing densities ranged from 2. 11 to 4. 23 TLU/ha (Tropical Livestock Unit = 250 kg liveweight). Both pastures were grazed in the previous wet season by West African Dwarf goats at similar grazing densities.

40|$|Schemes {{designed}} to make farming landscapes less hostile to wildlife have been questioned because target taxa do not always respond in the expected manner. Microbats are often overlooked in this process, yet persist in agricultural landscapes and exert top-down control of crop pests. We investigated the relationship between microbats and measures commonly incorporated into agri-environment schemes, to derive management recommendations for their ongoing conservation. We used acoustic detectors to quantify bat species richness, activity, and feeding in 32 linear remnants and adjacent fields across an agricultural region of New South Wales, Australia. Nocturnal arthropods were simultaneously trapped using black-light traps. We recorded 91, 969 bat calls, 17, 277 {{of which could be}} attributed to one of the 13 taxa recorded, and 491 calls contained feeding buzzes. The linear remnants supported higher bat activity than the fields, but species richness and feeding activity did not significantly differ. We trapped a mean 87. 6 g (± 17. 6 g SE) of arthropods per night, but found no differences in biomass between land uses. Wider linear remnants with intact native vegetation supported more bat species, as did those adjacent to unsealed, as opposed to sealed roads. Fields of <b>unimproved</b> native <b>pastures,</b> with more retained scattered trees and associated hollows and logs, supported the greatest bat species richness and activity. We conclude that the juxtaposition of linear remnants of intact vegetation and scattered trees in fields, coupled with less-intensive land uses such as <b>unimproved</b> <b>pastures</b> will benefit bat communities in agricultural landscapes, and should be incorporated into agri-environment schemes. In contrast, sealed roads may act as a deterrent. The "wildlife friendly farming" vs "land sparing" debate has so far primarily focussed on birds, but here we have found evidence that the integration of both approaches could particularly benefit bats...|$|R
