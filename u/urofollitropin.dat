50|$|<b>Urofollitropin</b> is a {{purified}} form of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) that is {{manufactured by}} extraction from human urine and then purified to remove various proteins and other substances. FSH {{is important in}} the development of follicles (eggs) produced by the ovaries. Given by subcutaneous injection, it is used in combination with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to assist in ovulation and fertility. It is also used with in vitro fertilization methods. The dosage is adjusted to each individual's response.|$|E
40|$|Anovulation is {{a common}} cause of female infertility. Treatment for women with {{anovulation}} is aimed at induction of ovulation. Ovulation induction with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is indicated in women with WHO type II anovulation in whom treatment with clomifene citrate (clomifene) has failed. The majority of these women have polycystic ovary syndrome. The major disadvantages of ovulation induction with FSH are the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome {{and the risk of}} higher order multiple pregnancies. To reduce the rate of complications due to multiple follicular development, FSH should be administered using a chronic low-dose protocol with small dose increments. In women with WHO type I anovulation, an exogenous supply of luteinizing hormone (LH) is required to achieve an adequate follicular response to FSH treatment. Thus, ovulation induction with FSH is not the treatment of choice in these women. FSH is a hormone that stimulates follicle growth and oocyte maturation. Endogenous FSH is produced by the pituitary gland and exists as a family of isohormones exhibiting distinct oligosaccharide structures. FSH for exogenous administration is derived from urine or is produced as recombinant FSH. The commercially available FSH products all contain different mixtures of FSH isoforms. To determine the effectiveness of <b>urofollitropin</b> (urinary-derived FSH), a comparison with the other available gonadotropins was made (i. e. recombinant FSH and human menopausal gonadotropin). <b>Urofollitropin</b> and recombinant FSH appear to be equally effective and well tolerated for ovulation induction. Human menopausal gonadotropin is comparably effective to <b>urofollitropin</b> in terms of pregnancy outcomes. It remains unclear whether human menopausal gonadotropins have a higher risk of overstimulation and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome compared to <b>urofollitropin</b> in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. In practice, recombinant products are more convenient to use but are also more expensive. Therefore, if availability is not an issue but costs are, there is still a place for the use of urofollitropins for ovulation inductio...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} multicenter {{study was}} to investigate the influence of different commercially produced gonadotropins (menotropin - HP, follitropin alpha and beta, <b>urofollitropin),</b> GnRH agonist (triptorelin, leuprorelin, nafarelinacetat) versus antagonists (cetrorelixacetat) upon maturity of human oocytes and the developmental potential of M II oocytes in 564 ICSI cycles. We evaluated defined extracytoplasmatic (1 st polar body, pervitellin space, oocyte shape) and cytoplasmatic (grade of granulation, vacuoles, refractile bodies) criteria and followed their effect upon the fertilization process. The number of retrieved cumulus oocyte complexes (COC) was significantly higher when agonist protocols were performed compared to antagonists (10, 4 vs. 9, 5). There was also found a significantly higher number of COC after application of follitropin beta and <b>urofollitropin</b> (11, 7; 11, 3) compared to menotropin (9, 3), follitropin alpha (10, 0) and the combination with menotropin (9, 0). The agonist protocol also led to a clearly higher number of mature MII oocytes than in the group with cetrorelixacetat. There was no significant difference within the various gonadotropin medications regarding the grade of oocyte maturity. 23, 5 % of all oocytes were ideally shaped. The number of oocytes with abnormal morphological criteria was greatest when the agonist protocol was applied with triptorelinacetat or <b>urofollitropin.</b> The different hormon medications led to the appearance of various extracytoplasmic and cytoplasmic oocyte dysmorphisms. According to my investigations the shape of the first polar body was the only morphological criterion among all inverstigated abnormal oocyte parameter which had no negative impact on the fertilization rate. The selection of ideal oocytes by detailed morphological criteria resulted in an improvement of all clinical parameter and is a valueable prognostic factor for a successful treatment. Due to a higher oocyte yield, improved fertilization-, pregnancy  and birth rates therapies with recombinant FSH or Menotropin  HP are superiour compared to treatments with <b>urofollitropin.</b> Keywords: controlled ovarial stimulation (COS), nuclear maturation process, oocyte morphology, extracytoplasmic parameter, cytoplasmic parameter, fertilization rate, embryo quality, birth rat...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study is to analyze the cost of {{controlled}} ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) of in vitro fertilization (IVF) during the period 2009 - 2013 in a specialized gynecology clinic. It is a prospective, observational study and bottom up cost analysis of the COH pharmacotherapy of IVF. The data was collected for all women admitted to the clinic, therapeutic COH protocols, prescribed medicines and doses, average length of therapy and its cost. Statistical analysis is applied towards the pharmacotherapy and cost data. On average 136 (SD 21. 92) women were admitted varying from 105 to 179 for 10. 7 (SD 1. 47) days. 11 % were on long (GnRH agonist containing) therapeutic COH protocol and all other on short (GnRH antagonist containing). Therapeutic protocols include Follitropin-α IU (103 women at average dose of 1171 IU (SD 314. 16)); Follitropin-β IU (299 wom-en at average dose of 1634 IU (SD 423. 5)); <b>Urofollitropin</b> 75 IU amp (243 women at average dose of 21. 3 IU (SD 7. 37)); urFSH + urLH 75 IU: 75 IU/amp (354 women at average dose of 23. 4 IU (SD 8. 8)); cetrorelix amp 0. 25 mg prescribed at 264 women at average dose of 3. 84 IU (SD 1. 32); gani-relix amp 0. 25 mg for 299 women at average dose of 4. 01 mg (SD 1. 32); Human chorion gonado-tropin for 535 women at average dose of 6752. 52 IU (SD 1216. 23); Nafarelin mcg/ml for 8 wome...|$|E
40|$|Objective: {{to compare}} the safety and {{efficacy}} of recombinant FSH (follitropin beta, Puregon, NV Organon, OSS The Netherlands) and urinary FSH (<b>urofollitropin,</b> Metrodin; Ares-Seronon, Geneva, Switzerland). Design: A prospective, multicenter, assessor-blind, randomized, clinical trial. Setting: 12 European infertility clinics. Patients: 172 women (recombinant FSH: n= 105; urinary FSH: n= 67) with clomiphene citrate-resistant normogonadotropic chronic anovulation (WHO group II). Interventions: eligible subjects were randomized (ratio of recombinant to urinary FSH, 3 : 2) and treated for a maximum of three cycles. A low-dose step-up regimen was used, with 75 IU of FSH given IM daily for a maximum of 14 days and, if needed, weekly increments of half an ampule given thereafter until the threshold dose for follicular development was achieved. Main outcome measures: cumulative ovulation rate after three cycles, total FSH dose, and treatment period needed to achieve anovulation. Results: the cumulative ovulation rates after three treatment cycles were 95 % and 96 % for the recombinant and urinary FSH groups, respectively. Overall, ovulation was seen in 155 of 223 treatment cycles (69. 5 %) in the recombinant FSH group, compared with 92 of 138 treatment cycles (66. 7 %) in the urinary FSH group. In the first cycle, a statistically significantly lower total dose (750 versus 1, 035 UI)) and a shorter treatment period (10 vs 13 days) were needed in the recombinant FSH group to reach ovulation. Only one case of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome led to hospitalization. Two sets of twin (1 in each treatment group) and 1 set of triplets (in the recombinant FSH group) were born. Conclusions: recombinant FSH (Puregon) is more efficient than urinary FSH (Metrodin) in inducing follicular developmen...|$|E
