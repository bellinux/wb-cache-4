5|$|The {{first song}} {{came on and}} I just stood <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> kind of walked {{into the other room}} as if I was in a tractor beam and stood there in front of the stereo.

25|$|The {{one that}} {{finished}} my career was when I got hit in my eye by John Maguire from Queensland...He got one to really rear <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{got back to}} hook and it went between the visor and the top part of the helmet and smashed in my eye. That finished me. After that, I didn't want to be there. I thought of other things I wanted to do in life. Even though I continued playing on in Shield {{for two or three}} years, I just didn't want to be there.|$|E

25|$|It was Fala, my husband's little dog, {{who never}} really readjusted. Once, in 1945, when General Eisenhower came {{to lay a}} wreath on Franklin's grave, {{the gates of the}} regular {{driveway}} were opened and his automobile approached the house accompanied by the wailing of the sirens of a police escort. When Fala heard the sirens, his legs straightened out, his ears pricked <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> knew that he expected to see his master coming down the drive as he had come so many times. Later, when we were living in the cottage, Fala always lay near the dining-room door where he could watch both entrances just as he did when his master was there. Franklin would often decide suddenly to go somewhere and Fala had to watch both entrances in order to be ready to spring up and join the party on short notice. Fala accepted me after my husband's death, but I was just someone to put up with until the master should return.|$|E
500|$|An October 1995 feature quoted Kevin Hull, the BBC {{documentary}} maker {{responsible for}} the Omnibus item, saying he had found [...] "the boys rather depressed, and almost {{in a state of}} shock".

[...] However, in the late 1990s he conceived an idea for a prequel serial, entitled Quatermass in the Third Reich set in Germany in the 1930s. The idea was submitted to the BBC, who turned it down.|$|E

"Most {{guys are}} relaxed, but I look <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> see Kellen, and he's... going 110 miles an hour," [...] said 2013–14 Butler Bulldogs first year head coach Brandon Miller during an August {{overseas}} basketball tour. [...] "Sprinting {{up and down}} the court. Shooting pull-ups. Going as hard and as fast as he possible can.

"For an eighteen-year-old bowler I {{was unusually}} fast, and enjoyed terrorising our opponents, be they schoolboys (8 wickets for 2 runs and 7 for 11 {{stick in the}} memory) or, better still, the {{teachers}} in the annual staff match.

500|$|Considering what to write, Carrier {{thought of}} his own childhood. He stated in an {{interview}} that he began thinking of [...] "when was it that I felt I was really myself? And I remember it was when I put on my skates and my Eaton catalogues on my legs, and I stood <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was taller than my mom, and I had a stick in my hands, so I was stronger than my brother, and I felt that I was little me. So I started to write about that and it turned into the Hockey Sweater story." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Bond's {{life as a}} {{performer}} in the theatre had ended at age 44, she occasionally gave charity concerts thereafter. [...] Unlike Bond's first marriage, her second was a happy one. Initially reluctant to leave London, Bond reported, [...] "We entertained a good deal, and gave hunt lunches and shooting parties of our own, so my time was well filled <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> missed London less than I could have believed." [...] She founded and directed the Newark Amateur Dramatic Society, an amateur dramatic club, whose performances supported local charities. [...] The couple also often visited London and did some travelling abroad.|$|E
500|$|The band's guitarists, Dave Murray, Adrian Smith and Janick Gers, {{each have}} their own {{individual}} influences and playing style. Dave Murray {{is known for his}} legato technique which, he claims, [...] "evolved naturally. I'd heard Jimi Hendrix using legato when I was growing <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> liked that style of playing." [...] Stating that he [...] "was inspired by blues rock rather than metal," [...] Adrian Smith was influenced by Johnny Winter and Pat Travers, leading to him becoming a [...] "melodic player." [...] Janick Gers, on the other hand, prefers a more improvised style, largely inspired by Ritchie Blackmore, which he claims is in contrast to Smith's [...] "rhythmic" [...] sound.|$|E

And everybody know Rick Ross albums is events. So Ye pulled a track <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was telling him I think it's a banger, it's a smash, and he thought we should give it to Rozay.

It was originally intended for American hip hop group Three 6 Mafia. However, after hearing it, Perry chose {{to work with the}} track. She told MTV News: [...] "I heard it and I always knew I wanted to write this futuristic, alienistic song, and they pulled it <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was like, 'Wait, I can wrap my head around this. I know this seems like a long shot, but I think I have the perfect material to put on top of this sound.' And I did, and it really worked out perfectly." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} Notre Dame in 2000, Dunst {{continued}} the acting career {{that she had}} begun. As a teenager, she {{found it difficult to}} deal with her rising fame, and for a period she blamed her mother for pushing her into acting as a child. However, she later expressed that her mother [...] "always had the best intentions". When asked if she had any regrets about the way she spent her childhood, Dunst said: [...] "Well, it's not a natural way to grow up, but it's the way I grew <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't change it. I have my stuff to work out... I don't think anybody can sit around and say, 'My life is more screwed up than yours.' Everybody has their issues." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics to}} the first verse of [...] "Born Again" [...] were written while Third Day's lead singer, Mac Powell, was folding laundry.

All of a sudden it just came out--a full first verse literally. It wasn’t like I said a line and worked out a few other lines, it literally just came out.

500|$|Mills portrayed Abby from 1980–1989. Prior {{to being}} cast in Knots Landing, Mills was {{primarily}} known {{for playing the}} [...] "damsel in distress" [...] archetype in both film and television media. The actress became somewhat famous for playing these roles, often leading to unwanted typecasting. In an interview with Jerry Buck for the Toledo Blade, Mills said: [...] "I got tired of playing the victim. It's a more active role. Abby keeps things stirred <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> like that." [...] According to Jacobs, Abby was not planned when the show began. He knew that he wanted a female J.R. Ewing-esque character. However, he had a different sense of the character and who would {{wind up in the}} role. With Mills' reputation of playing the victim, he initially didn't choose her for the part.|$|E
500|$|... "On , I {{really just}} wanted to put the mirror back onto the whole experience. You can see that she {{had that kind of}} confidence. And, literally, every take became a more and more {{confident}} take, so that she could have fun with what was going on. Not being over-the-top sarcastic, but ... having a laugh at everything that was going on around her, with confidence. [...] The very last dance of the piece, she had her hair <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> go, 'Can you just do one for me with your hair down?' She dropped her hair down. You'll see we intercut with her hair up and her hair down. That was the last piece. She just rocked it from her heart. She choreographed that last dance at the very end. She did that on her own and said, 'Let's go for it'".|$|E
500|$|Gatski {{signed up}} for an Army reserve unit after the 1942 season as America's {{involvement}} in World War II intensified. Marshall canceled its football program in 1943 as Gatski entered his senior year, but his unit was activated and he was sent with an infantry division {{to fight in the}} European theater of World War II. He went to England and followed American troops as they landed in Normandy and marched further into Europe. [...] "I wasn't in any heavy fighting," [...] he later said. He was a Private First Class in the Army. Gatski returned from duty in 1945, but Marshall had yet to resume its football program, so he enrolled at Auburn University in Alabama and finished out his studies, playing part of the season on the school's football team. [...] "Marshall hadn't started back <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> hadn't played football for two years," [...] he later explained. [...] "I didn't want to sit around and do nothing, so I went to Auburn." ...|$|E
