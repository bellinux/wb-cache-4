40|$|National audienceIn {{the last}} decade, the inverse {{characterization}} of the macroscopic parameters of acoustic porous materials has increased in popularity due to its simplicity. Different techniques in the frequency and time domains have been proposed using ultrasound and audio frequencies. These techniques {{can be divided into}} two categories: iterative inversion and non-iterative <b>inversion</b> <b>techniques.</b> For both categories, the precursor model on which the inversion applies is generally based on an equivalent fluid theory where the porous medium is assumed homogeneous and acoustically rigid or limp. During experimentations, these assumptions may not be verified and other problems related to boundary conditions, measurement quality, and applicability of the precursor model can occur. Without any precautions, one can easily understand that applying <b>inversion</b> <b>techniques</b> can then yield non- physical macroscopic parameters. After giving an overview of the different acoustical <b>inversion</b> <b>techniques,</b> this presentation addresses the importance of defining some guidelines to ensure a better use of the <b>inversion</b> <b>techniques,</b> mainly those based on impedance tube measurements in the audio-frequency range.

40|$|International audienceEstimation of {{an unknown}} {{atmospheric}} release from a finite set of concentration measurements is considered an ill-posed inverse problem. Besides ill-posedness, the estimation process {{is influenced by the}} instrumental errors in the measured concentrations and model representativity errors. The study highlights the effect of minimizing model representativity errors on the source estimation. This is described in an adjoint modelling framework and followed in three steps. First, an estimation of point source parameters (location and intensity) is carried out using an <b>inversion</b> <b>technique.</b> Second, a linear regression relationship is established between the measured concentrations and corresponding predicted using the retrieved source parameters. Third, this relationship is utilized to modify the adjoint functions. Further, source estimation is carried out using these modified adjoint functions to analyse the effect of such modifications. The process is tested for two well known <b>inversion</b> <b>techniques,</b> called renormalization and least-square. The proposed methodology and <b>inversion</b> <b>techniques</b> are evaluated for a real scenario by using concentrations measurements from the Idaho diffusion experiment in low wind stable conditions.

30|$|In the study, {{the total}} layer number is {{designed}} to be 80 for the differential inversion. Because the layer number is too great, the inverted structure is not suitable to enable ground motion simulation in the future. Therefore, in addition, we use a stochastic <b>inversion</b> <b>technique.</b> First, based on the differential inverted result, we regroup the layered structure. On the basis of the gradient changes in the differential inverted results, we are able to determine the boundaries between the layers. The inverted structure with 80 layers is simplified to be a structure with fewer layers. Secondly, we choose the simplified structure as the initial model and then invert the structure using the stochastic <b>inversion</b> <b>technique.</b> During the stochastic inversion process, the parameters (e.g. velocity and thickness) between layers are independent. Besides, the damping value and the termination condition of the program used are the same with the differential <b>inversion</b> <b>technique.</b>|$|R

Underwater source localization is classically addressed under the angle of <b>inversion</b> <b>techniques.</b> However, because an inversion scheme is necessarily based on {{the knowledge of the}} environmental parameters, it may be not well adapted to a random and fluctuating underwater channel. Conversely, machine learning only requires using a training database, the environmental characteristics underlying the regression models. This makes machine learning adapted to fluctuating channels. In this paper, we propose to use non linear regressions for source localization in fluctuating oceans. The kernel regression as well as the local linear regression are compared to typical <b>inversion</b> <b>techniques,</b> namely Matched Field Beamforming and the algorithm MUSIC. Our experiments use both real tank-based and simulated data, introduced in the works of Real et al.

The lamination <b>inversion</b> <b>technique</b> is then presented, with special attention given to mathematical difficulties arising from discontinuities in the P(f) function, infinities in the integrand, and in some cases unknown integration limits. Methods outlined for minimizing the uncertainties due to discontinuities include the use of redundant information - that is the two distinct P(f) functions available for a given N(h) profile - and the use of models based on statistical data. Mathematical procedures are discussed that increase significantly the efficiency and accuracy of the required numerical integrations.

40|$|Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) {{membranes}} {{have been}} intensively investigated and commercialised with broad applications in water purification and wastewater treatment for decades {{due to its}} outstanding properties. Currently, PVDF membranes are mainly produced by the phase <b>inversion</b> <b>technique,</b> which is predominant in both laboratory research and industrial manufacturing. Various modification methods based on the phase <b>inversion</b> <b>technique</b> have also been developed to improve the membrane performances, but these improvements are incremental {{and there have been}} no important breakthroughs during the past decade. This thesis first explores the preparation of reinforced PVDF flat sheet membranes by blending nanoclay followed by the phase inversion process. Although the membranes showed improved water permeation flux and enhanced abrasion resistance, further improvements are limited by the phase <b>inversion</b> <b>technique</b> itself. Consequently, a new concept of membrane manufacturing procedure has been proposed by combining unidirectional crystallisation of green solvent and polymer diffusion. The new method uses crystallites of a solvent dimethyl sulfoxide with controlled sizes as pore templates to create enormous nanosized flow passages. It follows a completely different pore formation mechanism and therefore overcomes the drawbacks of the phase <b>inversion</b> <b>technique.</b> The resultant PVDF membranes have an asymmetric structure composed of a highly porous separation layer and gradually opened micro-channels. Due to the unique structure, the prepared membranes showed excellent permeation performances and mechanical properties overwhelming commercial PVDF membranes prepared by the phase <b>inversion</b> <b>technique.</b> The filtration performance of the PVDF membranes can be further improved by modification of the membrane material, for example, by blending polyethylene glycol in the dope solution. The obtained membrane with pore size of 36 nm showed extraordinary high flux of 1711 L/m 2 h and could withstand 35 bar in the test. Moreover, the new manufacturing process is of much fewer influencing factors compared to the phase inversion approach and thus highly reliable and repeatable. In principle, it is also applicable to other common polymeric membrane materials such as polyethersulfone and cellulose acetate. Open Acces...|$|R

For a point based release, {{the nature of a}} source is determined by fixed number of parameters, mainly its location and source strength.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of <b>inversion</b> <b>techniques</b> for Rayleigh surface waves dispersion curves and the application of these techniques at areas of geotechnical and environmental interest, using the Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) method. Prototype algorithms for the complete processing of seismic records, using MASW method, were also developed. The core of these algorithms consists of an executable FORTRAN file, which implements the forward problem and dispersion curve inversion. This core is supported by algorithms in MATLAB™ for seismic data I/O, dispersion curves extraction and intermediate and/or final results management and display. Thus, this thesis describes in detail the implementation of MASW stages, giving emphasis on the <b>inversion</b> <b>techniques</b> for the estimation of vertical Vs distribution. More specifically, the implemented <b>inversion</b> <b>techniques</b> are: the usage of Quasi-Newton methods, the minimization of L 1 or L 2 norms, the application of smoothing, damping and blocky constrains and their combinations, as well as weighting inversion using data errors and/or the values of Jacobian matrix. Furthermore, the user is allowed to delineate the initial model with flexibility, providing also the ability of any a-priori geophysical or/and geotechnical information usage. The prototype algorithms and the methodology, developed within the framework of this thesis, were examined using synthetic dispersion curves as well as synthetic seismic records. Subsequent tests involved for the evaluation of the inversion results for real data, collected close to a cross-hole survey. These data were inverted using the developed algorithms and commercial processing software. The proposed methodology of seismic processing with MASW method including 2 different <b>inversion</b> <b>techniques</b> (damping and combination of blocky constrain with L 1 norm minimization), was applied at 3 areas of environmental and 4 areas of geotechnical interest. The main conclusions deduced from this thesis indicate that the combined application of blocky constraint with L 1 minimization produces, in general, the best results. Nonetheless, the choice of the most appropriate <b>inversion</b> <b>technique</b> at different areas is considered essential. Finally, the proposed methodology and the developed prototype algorithms constitute a powerful tool for the application of MASW method to the environmental and geotechnical investigation. ...|$|R
