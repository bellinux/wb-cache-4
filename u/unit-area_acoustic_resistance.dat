40|$|With this study, {{we provide}} a global link between linear and {{non-linear}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> of a perforation {{as a function}} of orifice geometry and Strouhal number. High amplitudes of acoustic pressure induce flow separation {{at the edges of the}} orifices. This is a non-linear mechanism increasing the <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> of a perforation. Quasi-static models have been used to predict the <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> in the non-linear regime, yet the linear to non-linear transition has been out of focus so far. We carry out open-end impedance measurements in a semi-anechoic room with four different samples. These samples are selected to have different orifice geometries and edge profiles, so that the conclusions would be general. The most prominent result of this study is that the change in the non-linear resistance can be expressed {{as a function of}} the Strouhal number only, if the resistance is corrected for the vena-contracta factor which can be deduced from steady flow measurements. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A {{unification}} {{of the theory}} of the nonlinear <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> of Helmholtz resonators including grazing flow is presented. The nonlinear resistance due to grazing flow is considered to be caused by an exciting pressure spectrum produced by the interaction of the grazing flow and the jets flowing from the resonator orifices. With this exciting pressure spectrum the resonator can be treated {{in the same manner as}} a resonator without grazing flow but with an exciting acoustic spectrum. One of the important implications of this model is that a multiple-degree-of-freedom resonator can be analyzed with grazing flow. Using the grazing flow pressure spectrum, the nonlinear <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> can be properly distributed among the several elements of the resonator...|$|R

The method involved observation of the decay {{of a series of}} echos generated in a piezoelectric rod immersed in the liquid, one end of the rod being excited by a resonant cavity. The frequency of this cavity was 242 MHz in the greater proportion of this work but similar measurements were also made at 1048 MHz. The measurements at the lower frequency have confirmed the existence of the collective oscillation known as transverse zero sound in liquid helium- 3 at higher pressures, as predicted by the Landau Theory of a Fermi liquid. This has enabled an estimate to be made of the magnitude of the symmetrical Landau parameter, F 2 S. The result obtained was in agreement with those of other experimenters who have used a variety of methods to determine F 2 S. A similar experimental technique has been used to study the longitudinal <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> of liquid helium- 3 in order to investigate the anomalously high value of F 2 S indicated by previous measurements of this phenomenon. These measurements, both transverse and longitudinal, have mainly been carried out on pure helium- 3 (ie. better than 99. 9997 per cent) but some data have been obtained for the transverse <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> of helium- 3 in which a small amount of helium- 4 (about 1 %) was present.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} high speed grazing air flow on the <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> of perforated sheet materials used in the construction of acoustically absorptive liners placed in commercial aircraft engine nacelles. Since DC flow resistance of porous sheet materials is known to be a major component of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> of sound suppression liners, the DC flow resistance of a set of perforated face-sheets and linear 'wiremesh' face-sheets was measured in a flow duct apparatus (up to Mach 0. 8). Samples were fabricated to cover typical variations in perforated face-sheet parameters, such as hole diameter, porosity and sheet thickness, as well as those due to different manufacturing processes. The DC flow resistance data from perforated sheets were found to correlate strongly with the grazing flow Mach number and the face-sheet porosity. The data also show correlation against the boundary layer displacement thickness to hole-diameter ratio. The increase in resistance with grazing flow for punched aluminum sheets is in good agreement with published results up to Mach 0. 4, but is significantly larger than expected above Mach 0. 4. Finally, the tests demonstrated that there is a significant increase in the resistance of linear 'wiremesh' type face-sheet materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{acoustic}} {{properties of}} a compound micro-perforated panel (MPP) absorber array are investigated. The absorber array {{consists of three}} parallel-arranged MPP absorbers with different cavity depths. A finite element procedure is used to simulate its acoustic behaviors under normal incidence. Experimental studies are carried out to verify the numerical simulations. Due to different reactance matching conditions in the absorber array, strong local resonance occurs and the corresponding local resonance absorption dominates. Compared with single MPP absorber, the absorber array requires lower <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> for good absorption performance, and the resonance frequencies shift due to inter-resonator interactions. The different <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> requirement is explained by considering the reduced effective perforation rate of the MPP in the absorber array. The performance of the absorber array varies with the sizes and spatial arrangement of the component absorbers. When the distance between component absorbers is larger than a quarter-wavelength, the above-mentioned parallel absorption mechanism diminishes. In the experimental study, the normal incidence absorption coefficients of a prototype MPP absorber array are tested. The measured results compare well with the numerical predictions. The experimental study also shows that although other absorption mechanisms may exist, dissipation by the MPP is dominant in the MPP absorber array. © 2011 Acoustical Society of America. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{trends in}} {{aircraft}} engine design have highlighted {{the need for}} acoustic liners that provide broadband sound absorption with reduced liner thickness. Three such liner concepts are evaluated using the NASA normal incidence tube. Two concepts employ additive manufacturing techniques to fabricate liners with variable chamber depths. The first relies on scrubbing losses within narrow chambers to provide <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> necessary for sound absorption. The second employs wide chambers that provide minimal resistance, and relies on a perforated sheet to provide <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance.</b> The variable-depth chambers used in both concepts result in reactance spectra near zero. The third liner concept employs mesh-caps (resistive sheets) embedded at variable depths within adjacent honeycomb chambers to achieve a desired impedance spectrum. Each of these liner concepts is suitable {{for use as a}} broadband sound absorber design, and a transmission line model is presented that provides good comparison with their respective acoustic impedance spectra. This model can therefore be used to design acoustic liners to accurately achieve selected impedance spectra. Finally, the effects of increasing the perforated facesheet thickness are demonstrated, and the validity of prediction models based on lumped element and wave propagation approaches is investigated. The lumped element model compares favorably with measured results for liners with thin facesheets, but the wave propagation model provides good comparisons {{for a wide range of}} facesheet thicknesses...|$|R

40|$|Results from {{impedance}} eduction methods {{developed by}} NASA Langley Research Center are {{used throughout the}} acoustic liner community. In spite of recent enhancements, occasional anomalies persist with these methods, generally at frequencies where the liner produces minimal attenuation. This investigation demonstrates an experimental approach to educe impedance with increased confidence over a desired frequency range, by combining results from successive tests with different cavity depths. A series of tests is conducted with three wire-mesh facesheets, for which the results should be weakly dependent on source sound pressure level and mean grazing flow speed. First, a raylometer is {{used to measure the}} DC flow resistance of each facesheet. These facesheets are then mounted onto a frame and a normal incidence tube is used to determine their respective acoustic impedance spectra. A comparison of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> component with the DC flow resistance for each facesheet is used to validate the measurement process. Next, each facesheet is successively mounted onto three frames with different cavity depths, and a grazing flow impedance tube is used to educe their respective acoustic impedance spectra with and without mean flow. The no-flow results are compared with those measured in the normal incidence tube to validate the impedance eduction method. Since the anti-resonance frequency varies with cavity depth, each sample provides robust results over a different frequency range. Hence, a combination of results can be used to determine the facesheet <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance.</b> When combined with the acoustic reactance, observed to be weakly dependent on the source sound pressure level and grazing flow Mach number, the acoustic impedance can be educed with increased confidence. Representative results of these tests are discussed, and the complete database is available in electronic format upon request...|$|R

40|$|A {{generalized}} approximate equation for duct lining {{sound attenuation}} is presented. The specification of two parameters, the maximum possible attenuation and the optimum wall acoustic impedance {{is shown to}} completely determine the sound attenuation for any acoustic mode at any selected wall impedance.

For impedances far from the optimum, the equation reduces to Morse's approximate expression. The equation can be used for initial acoustic liner design. Not least important is the illustrative nature of the solutions which provide an understanding of the duct propagation problem usually obscured in the exact calculations. Sample calculations using the approximate attenuation equation show that the peak and the bandwidth of the sound attenuation spectrum can be represented by quite simple functions of the ratio of actual wall <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> to optimum resistance...|$|R

40|$|As part of {{a program}} to {{evaluate}} an inlet suppressor design method based on mode cutoff ratio, three single degree of freedom liners with different open area ratio face sheets were designed for a single spinning mode. This mode was generated by placing 41 rods {{in front of the}} 28 blade fan of a JT 15 D turbofan engine. At the liner design this near cutoff mode has a theoretical maximum attenuation of nearly 200 dB per L/D.

This additional attenuation is large for high open area ratios and should be accounted for in the theory. The data shows the additional attenuation to be inversely proportional to <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance.</b> It was thought that the additional attenuation could be caused by reflection and modal scattering at the hard to soft wall interface.
