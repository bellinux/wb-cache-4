5|$|The {{real issue}} is that it moves the moral center more towards the obscene. That it becomes more normal to be more sexually promiscuous, because they are bombarded with imagery that is loaded with innuendo, and that is seen as normal, even preferred... if girls and women find their {{identity}} and self-worth in the approval of people, they will {{do whatever it takes}} to become popular and loved. When stars like Rihanna, who blast sexuality, are thrust into the limelight, girls tend to think that is the way for them to be valuable. God tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> fearfully and wonderfully made... bearing His image. Rihanna is selling a lie.|$|E

It is another of those appellations that is less well known, as its wines used to be sold as Volnay or Pommard. It has 32ha of Premier Crus within its 170ha, and the {{significant}} plantings of Chardonnay tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> about to enter white wine territory.|$|E
500|$|Bryan {{continued}} with language evoking the Civil War, telling his audience that [...] "in this contest brother has been arrayed against brother, father against son." [...] By then, {{as he spoke}} in a sincere tone, his voice sounded clearly and loudly through the hall. He denied, however that the contest was personal; he bore no ill-will towards those who supported the gold standard. However, he stated, facing towards the gold delegates, [...] "when you come before us and tell <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> about to disturb your business interests, we reply that you have disturbed our business interests by your course." [...] The gold men, during the address, paid close attention and showed their appreciation for Bryan's oratory. Bryan then defended the right of silver supporters to make their argument against opposition from gold men, who were associated with financial interests, especially in the East. Although his statements nominally responded to a point made by Russell, Bryan had thought of the argument the previous evening, and had not used it in earlier speeches. He always regarded it as the best point he made during the speech, and only the ending caused more reaction from his listeners: ...|$|E

2500|$|The Pittsburgh City-County Building (serving as City Hall) is {{separate}} from the courthouse, and is jointly owned by the city and county. The city had placed a 45-foot Christmas tree {{in front of the}} building [...] "for a number of years." [...] In 1986, the city placed a plaque beneath the tree with the mayor's name, entitled [...] "Salute to Liberty." [...] Below the title, the sign stated: [...] "During this holiday season, the city of Pittsburgh salutes liberty. Let these festive lights remind <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> the keepers of the flame of liberty and our legacy of freedom." [...] Since 1982, the city had also placed a menorah with the Christmas tree in front of the City-County Building. The city did not own the menorah, but placed, removed, and stored it each year. The menorah was owned by Chabad House, Pittsburgh's Lubavitch Center.|$|E
2500|$|Polish Americans (and Poles {{around the}} world) were elated by the {{election}} of Pope John Paul II in 1978. Polish identity and ethnic pride grew {{as a result of}} his papacy. Polish Americans partied when he was elected Pope, and Poles worldwide were ecstatic to see him in person. John Paul II's charisma drew large crowds wherever he went, and American Catholics organized pilgrimages to see him in Rome and Poland. Polish pride reached a height unseen by generations of Polish Americans. Sociologist Eugene Obidinski said, [...] "there is a feeling that one of our kind has made it. Practically every issue of the Polish American papers reminds <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> in a new glorious age." [...] Polish Americans had been doubly blessed during the election; [...] and Karol Wojtyla became the first Polish pope. John Paul II's wide popularity and political power gave him soft power crucial to Poland's Solidarity movement. His visit to Poland and open support for the Solidarity movement is credited for bringing a swift end to communism in 1981, as well as the subsequent fall of the Iron Curtain. John Paul II's theology was staunchly conservative on social and sexual issues, and though popular as a religious and political figure, church attendance among Polish Americans did slowly decline during his papacy. John Paul II used his influence with the Polish American faithful to reconnect with the Polish National Catholic Church, and won some supporters back to the Catholic Church. John Paul II reversed the nearly 100-year excommunication of Francis Hodur and affirmed that those who received sacraments at the National Church were receiving the valid Eucharist. In turn, Prime Bishop Robert M. Nemkovich attended the funeral of John Paul II in 2005. John Paul II remains a popular figure for Polish Americans, and American politicians and religious leaders have invoked his memory to build cultural connection.|$|E

We know {{that to be}} a man, we must be something more than an animal--a mere brute--for when we call any one a brute, what do we mean? That he has lost his humanity, his sense of justice, mercy, and decency, and given himself up to his flesh--his animal nature, till the man in him is dead, and only the brute remains. Mind, I do not say that we are right in calling any human being a brute, for no one, I believe, is sunk so low, but there is some spark of humanity, some spark of what St. Paul calls [...] "the spirit," [...] left in him, which may be fanned into a flame and conquer, and raise and save the man at last--unless he be a mere idiot--or that most unhappy and brutal of all beings, a confirmed drunkard.|$|E
