40|$|Evaluation of {{suitable}} {{sites for}} coal-fired thermal power plants {{is very important}} as there are several such plants to {{come up in the}} future. All generating plants except Upper Kotmale Hydro Power plant in "Long Term Generation Expansion Plan 2009 - 2022 " published by the CEB are coal power plants. Two locations already have been identified for coal power plants at Norochcholei and Sampur for 900 MW and 1000 MW respectively. The study reveals that there is no provision to expand beyond the designed capacity at Norochcholei plant. There is no technical limitation to expand the designed capacity at Sampur plant. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate a further eight proposed sites analyzing following important factors which influence site suitability. These factors are; 1 Supply of coal and transportation facilities on land and at sea 2 Availability of sufficient cooling water and feed water 3 Proximity to the load centers / access to the national grid 4 Distance from populated area (Environmental aspects including impact on the population) 5 Depth of the sea near the coast 6 Availability of sufficient area for power plant, coal storage and ash disposal 7 Other factors 7. 1 Access to the land 7. 2 Topography/ geology 7. 3 Meteorology 7. 4 Hydrogeology 7. 5 Natural hazards Of the eight sites to be evaluated the CEB has identified five tentative locations in its "Long Term Generation Expansion Plan 2009 - 2022 " near Athuruwella, Mawella, Mirijjawela, Karagan Lewaya, and Mirissa along the southern coast. No detailed study has been done for these locations. Hence, initially, these five locations were taken into consideration for the study from among the eight proposed sites. Three additional locations are proposed by the author for consideration along the eastern coast. They are near Panama, Sangamankanda Point and Vakarei. Although CEB proposed Karagan Lewaya to be considered as a site it had to be abandoned subsequently because the GOSL has used this site for the recently commissioned Hambantota harbor. As a result of that the study is carried out based on the other seven proposed sites for detailed evaluation. Sri Lanka has no coal mines, thus coal needs to be imported to the sites from countries such as Indonesia, South Africa or Australia who have indigenous coal mines. Hence coal transporting has to be done by vessels to the site especially with Panamax size vessels and Cape size vessels to keep the cost at a minimum level. Another major factor is the supply sufficient water to the site in order to cool the process and process water. These two factors require that the site has to be close to the coast. It can be seen that the four sites Athuruwella, Mawella, Mirissa and Mirijjawela on the southern coast are close to the populated areas and the lands in the vicinity are ideal for agriculture as well as tourism. Some major resettlement plans are required with a suitable compensation scheme when acquiring the lands for the sites at these four locations in the southern province. In contrast, however, the population density at Panama, Sangamankanda Point and Vakarei in the eastern province is comparatively low but the infrastructure needs to be developed. The grid substations at Ambalangoda, Matara, Hambantota, Ampara and Valachchena are considered as gateways to the national grid from the proposed locations. These can access only the 132 kV grid and needs to be augmented to handle 220 kV at the substation andtransmission lines. Other major factor to be considered is the depth of the sea near the proposed site as this determines how far the vessels can approach the coast and hence estimates the distance of the coal <b>unloading</b> <b>conveyor</b> and the size of the jetty in the sea. Mirijjawela has the advantage of having use of the newly commissioned Hambantota harbor for this purpose as it is about 1 km away from the site. Acquiring of required land area for the proposed site needs to be carefully done. When it is needed to acquire the lands from the residents in the area a reasonable compensation scheme and resettlement plan has to be introduced. Therefore it is of great benefit and cost saving if government owned bare land is available in the proposed areas. Although access to the lands, topography/ geology, meteorology, hydrogeology, natural hazards are minor factors for site selection of a coal power plant, these should also be taken into consideration because the damages can be very high when natural hazards occur like the Tsunami in 2004, although this occurs rarely. The proposed locations should be selected away from any protected wildlife zones, sanctuaries and places with historical values in the country. Then proposed locations are analyzed based on the above factors and for comparison a site validation matrix is prepared with introducing a suitable marking scheme in order to select the best location for the next coal power generation plant...|$|E

The proposed software, named TARAS, is described in detail, highlighting the features which make it particularly suitable for the mechanical components failure analysis. To demonstrate the software potential, a test-case is provided, consisting in the failure analysis of the transport line required to feed a pulverized coal steam plant for electric power production. The transportation plant consists in several belt <b>conveyors,</b> <b>unloading</b> machines, stacker-reclaimer machines etc. The work demonstrates a satisfactory capability of the software TARAS to cope with very complex mechanical systems...|$|R
40|$|Unpredictable {{fracture}} of round steel link chains reduce the economic {{efficiency of the}} machines they are used in and increase the hazard potential for the operating personnel. In order to reduce such incidents appropriate measures for early detection are needed to determine an optimum time of repair or replacement. By steadily increasing strain, the currently applied, discontinuous and manually performed control processes does not present a satisfactory solution. They should be supplemented with new, {{the current state of}} the art considering approaches. This thesis addresses these issues and depicts the evaluation results of an individually developed measurement system for chains including the acquisition and processing of lifetime related variables. The focus hereby lies on standardized round steel link chains, which are preferably used in mining or in the hoisting equipment. Relevant damages to chains can be largely attributed to mechanical overstress of the base material. Typical damage patterns are fatigue fractures and forced fractures that are favoured depending on the environmental conditions, through wear and corrosion. As well-proven approach to estimate the remaining lifetime, the method of calculation of service strength was established. In adaptation to the use case chain, a component specific S-N curve and a nominal-stress-time-curve associated to collective stress are required. Subsequently, both are linked by the linear damage accumulation hypothesis. The chain specific S-N curve was created on the basis of previous trials of WBK Seilprüfstelle. The conducted dynamic fatigue trials respect a wide range of standardized chain sizes and rely on two different load assumptions. Thus a weighted consideration of the real load conditions is possible. By using the two parametric Markov counting algorithm, the collective normal stress will be calculated. Essential for this is an accurate load-time-curve that comprises of the real surrounding conditions precisely. For an accurate determination of the replacement state, the generated collective must represent the complete history of the chain link. This important requirement can only be achieved by a constantly working measurement system, which is directly connected to the focused link over the entire service life. A market research concerning established and free accessible measurement systems for chains revealed no satisfactory solution also complying with the elaborate chain specific requests. For this purpose, the development of a customized measurement system was focus of the public funded research project i-MaSS (integrated machine sensor system). For the integration of the miniaturized and energy-efficient prototypes in the chain strand, customized adapters are required. With regard to the minimal installation space available a conceptual division respective to the layout took place here. For chains with a wire gauge ≥ 30 mm (preferable mining chains) the developed adapter element looks like a stud chain link with a borehole in the middle. Wire gauges < 30 mm (e. g. hoisting chains) can not house the measurement systems directly as a consequence of the filigree geometry. In this regard an alternative solution was designed which can be mounted in the flow of force at the end of the chain strand. The testing of each adapter variant was performed on different test rigs for mining and hoisting chains separately. For the considered use case mining chain static test series were carried on a horizontally operating tension testing machine; dynamic analyses on a close to reality but <b>unloaded</b> armoured face <b>conveyor</b> test bench. The results obtained depict a linear and reproducible transmission behaviour of the complete measurement chain. The for chain hoists designed concept was trialled on a seven meter high test tower under realistic conditions. Hereby, the performed static and dynamic test series reveal a satisfying transmission behaviour, which is furthermore repeatable and analytically traceable. All test bench trials achieved acceptable results for both developed measurement concepts. Therefore, they can be used as a practicable tool for determining the load-time-curve of adequate quality. In conjunction with the deduced and for chains adapted calculation of service strength, it is now possible to estimate the remaining life time of standardized round link chains of different size more precisely...|$|R
