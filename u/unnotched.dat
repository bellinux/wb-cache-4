Hence {{the current}} of {{electricity}} which is excited in metal when {{moving in the}} neighbourhood of a magnet, depends for its direction altogether upon {{the relation of the}} metal to the resultant of magnetic action, or to the magnetic curves, and may be expressed in a popular way thus; Let AB (fig. 25.) represent a cylinder magnet, A being the marked pole, and B the unmarked pole; let PN be a silver knife-blade, resting across the magnet with its edge upward, and with its marked or notched side towards the pole A; then in whatever direction or position this knife be moved edge foremost, either about the marked or the unmarked pole, the current of electricity produced will be from P to N, provided the intersected curves proceeding from A abut upon the notched surface of the knife, and those from B upon the <b>unnotched</b> side. Or if the knife be moved with its back foremost, the current will be from N to P in every possible position and direction, provided the intersected curves abut on the same surfaces as before. A little model is easily constructed, by using a cylinder of wood for a magnet, a flat piece for the blade, and a piece of thread connecting one end of the cylinder with the other, and passing {{through a hole in the}} blade, for the magnetic curves: this readily gives the result of any possible direction.|$|E

The stacking sequence alters the un-notched and notched strength. The failure mechanisms {{in these two}} cases are different. As a result, the hierarchies of <b>unnotched</b> and notched strength based on stacking sequence variation are different. The failure mechanisms have been discussed. The effect of stacking sequence on the <b>unnotched</b> and notched strength of woven fabric composites are compared with the UD tape laminate results reported earlier.

Comparisons of predicted and measured modulus and strength distributions are given for <b>unnotched</b> unidirectional, cross-ply, and quasi-isotropic laminates. The predicted modulus distributions were found to correlate well with the test results for all three <b>unnotched</b> laminates. Correlations of strength distributions for the <b>unnotched</b> laminates are judged good for the unidirectional laminate and fair for the cross-ply laminate, whereas the strength correlation for the quasi-isotropic laminate is deficient because IPACS {{did not yet have}} a progressive failure capability. The paper also presents probabilistic and structural reliability analysis predictions for the strain concentration factor (SCF) for an open-hole, quasi-isotropic laminate subjected to longitudinal tension. A special procedure was developed to adapt IPACS for the structural reliability analysis.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} effect of nonlinear material behavior on the response and failure of <b>unnotched</b> and notched angle-ply laminates under uniaxial compressive loading. The endochronic theory was chosen as the constitutive theory to model the AS 4 / 3502 graphite-epoxy material system. Three-dimensional finite element analysis incorporating the endochronic theory was used to determine the stresses and strains in the laminates. An incremental/iterative initial strain algorithm was used in the finite element program. To increase computational efficiency, a 180 deg rotational symmetry relationship was utilized and the finite element program was vectorized to run on a supercomputer. Laminate response was compared to experimentation revealing excellent agreement for both the <b>unnotched</b> and notched angle-ply laminates. Predicted stresses in the region of the hole were examined and are presented, comparing linear elastic analysis to the inelastic endochronic theory analysis. A failure analysis of the <b>unnotched</b> and notched laminates was performed using the quadratic tensor polynomial. Predicted fracture loads compared well with experimentation for the <b>unnotched</b> laminates, but were very conservative in comparison with experiments for the notched laminates...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{the first in a series}} which detail the {{mechanical}} behaviour, finite element predictions and fractographic observations of the failure of composite I-beams. Experimental investigations into the behaviour under static load of both <b>unnotched</b> and web- and flange-notched continuously reinforced carbon-fibre/epoxy and glass-fibre/epoxy I-beams are discussed. A four-point flexural configuration is used. The global static response and ultimate failure are described in terms of strains, compliance, buckling and final fracture. A mode of buckling that is antisymmetric across the width of the compressive flange is observed prior to failure in all cases. Failure of the <b>unnotched</b> I-beams is concentrated around a buckle on the compressive flange whilst failure of the notched I-beams initiates from a shear-loaded circular cutout within the web. Buckling of the <b>unnotched</b> beams occurs at loads that are approximately 50 % of the failure loads.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of an {{extensive}} study of the influence of average fibre diameter and the width of the diameter distribution on the performance of injection moulded glass-fibre reinforced polyamide 66. In the average fibre diameter range from 9 - 18 m dry-as-moulded (DaM) composite <b>unnotched</b> impact and tensile strength decreased significantly. The composite notched impact performance and tensile modulus showed little dependence on fibre diameter. The influence of broadening the fibre diameter distribution by blending glass fibre samples of different average diameter was found to be particularly negative on the level of composite <b>unnotched</b> impact when compared at equal number average diameter. After hydrolysis treatment the composite tensile strength and modulus exhibited a large drop compared to the DaM results. In contrast, the <b>unnotched</b> impact results became insensitive to fibre diameter after hydrolysis. The average level of <b>unnotched</b> impact after hydrolysis was sufficiently high to show an increase over DaM when the fibre diameter was above 14 m. Residual fibre length correlated significantly with fibre diameter with a lower average length for thinner fibres. The interfacial shear strength was found to be in the range of 26 - 34 MPa for DaM composites. There was a highly significant inverse correlation between the DaM interfacial strength and the average fibre diameter. It is shown that results from both tensile and <b>unnotched</b> impact measurements can be brought back to single trend lines by using a Z average value for the average fibre diameter which is more heavily weighted to the thicker fibres in the distribution...|$|E

40|$|From {{the fatigue}} test of notched {{specimens}} of isotropic 70 : 30 - brass, under bending, torsion, and combined stress state of them, a simple criterion for the slip-band crack initiation has been obtained. In {{spite of the}} complexity of the triaxial stress state below the notch root, only two stress components, the maximum shearing stress τ_ and the normal stress σ_n acting on a particular slip plane, are responsible for initiating slip-band cracks. Using the averaged stress values over the half-grain-size depth below the notch root, linear sum of them, τ_ + a・σ_n, acts just as the torsional stress in <b>unnotched</b> specimens.

The effect of notch size and notch position were investigated. Damage initiation and propagation in notched and <b>unnotched</b> coupons were also examined. Theory developed {{to predict the}} normal stress distribution near an open hole and failure for tape laminated composites was evaluated for its applicability to 2 D triaxial braided textile composite materials. Four different fiber architectures were considered; braid angle, yarn and braider size, percentage of longitudinal yarns and braider angle varied. Tape laminates equivalent to textile composites were also constructed for comparison. <b>Unnotched</b> tape equivalents were stronger than braided textiles but exhibited greater notch sensitivity. Notched textiles and tape equivalents have roughly the same strength at large notch sizes. Two common damage mechanisms were found: braider yarn cracking and near notch longitudinal yarn splitting. Cracking was found to initiate in braider yarns in <b>unnotched</b> and notched coupons, and propagate {{in the direction of}} the braider yarns until failure. Damage initiation stress decreased with increasing braid angle. No significant differences in prediction of near notch strain between textile and tape equivalents could be detected for small braid angle, but the correlations were weak for textiles with large braid angle.

40|$|Many {{researches}} {{are reported}} on the fatigue strength of <b>unnotched</b> specimens pre-strained. By their results， the fatigue limit of the pre-strained materials generally increase with increasing {{of the amount of}} pre-strain， but it is lower than that of the original when the pre-strain is small. While there are few investigations on the fatigue of notched specimens pre-strained. This paper is the results of experiment on the fatigue strength of the notched steel specimens having semi-circular groove of O. 54 mm radius，for which the tensile pre-strain and then the fatigue test by direct stress are conducted. And they are {{different from those of the}} previous investigations on the fatigue strength of the pre-strained <b>unnotched</b> materials. That is，the fatigue limit rises with the increasing of the amount of pre-stratin，even when the pre-strain is small. This pheomenon is made clear from the results of the measurement of micro-hardness on the cross section and the observation on the surface of the notch root，as following：the state of the notch root under small pre-strain corresponds to the large pre-strain of the <b>unnotched</b> specimen...|$|E

Applying the resulting model to the experimental data enables the fracture toughness of the test material to be determined as a function of test condition.

Static-tensile tests were both conducted on notched and <b>unnotched</b> specimens at typical temperatures (ambient, 95 °C and 125 °C) based on the glass transition temperatures (Tg) of the neat resin and composite, their strength and moduli were obtained and compared. The damage patterns of failed specimens of notched and <b>unnotched</b> were examined {{with the aid of}} high-definition camera and stereomicroscope. The results of stress-strain relationships showed that the slight nonlinearity of the curves were observed for these two specimens, which was associated with the plastic deformation of localized resin. The damage patterns of notched and <b>unnotched</b> specimens at different temperatures proved that damage and plastic deformation were two simultaneous mechanisms and it was prominent in the notched. It was the overstress accommodation mechanism that led to a relative high strength rentention for the notched and a reduction of the hole sensitivity.

40|$|The fatigue {{resistance}} of a multiaxial braided (3 -D) graphite/expoxy composite in both <b>unnotched</b> and post impacted conditions has been evaluated. The material tested is a (+/- 30 / 0 deg) multiaxial braid constructed from AS 4 / 12 K tow graphite fibers and British Petroleum E 905 L epoxy resin.

40|$|Generally, {{areas of}} {{components}} with notches or geometrical transitions are critical {{because of the}} resulting stress/strain concentrations. In these areas due to the stress-gradients and constraint local deformations are displacement controlled even if the material's yield stress is exceeded, {{as long as the}} deformations are below the structural yield point. Therefore, load controlled tests in the elasto-plastic region with <b>unnotched</b> specimens from ductile materials under combined axial loading and torsion are not suitable for the interpretation of component's behavior because of uncontrolled local deformations. Thus, the influence of multiaxial stress strain states on the fatigue behavior of a component under elasto-plastic deformations can be determined reliably with <b>unnotched</b> specimens only by deformation controlled tests, if cyclic creep is not expected in critical areas...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper {{the results of a}} size effect study on plain {{concrete}} <b>unnotched</b> and notched beams loaded in three-point bending are shown and compared with experimental results and Bazant's size effect law. The numerical results, obtained using the nonlocal microplane finite element code, confirm a strong size effect for smaller beam sizes. However, for larger <b>unnotched</b> beams the nominal strength tends to a constant value related to the uniaxial tensile strength. These results are in good agreement with what has been observed in experiments. The reason why the nominal strength of large <b>unnotched</b> beams should approach a limit value different from zero is investigated and the range of applicability of the size effect law is discussed. It has been concluded that the applicability of the size effect law is dependent on the problem type i. e. if the crack propagation before peak load is very stable the size effect law may be used in a rather broad size range. However, if this is not the case, the validity of the size effect law is limited to a smaller size range. Therefore, before extrapolating the size effect from tests with a small size range to a very large size range experimental data from a large size range should be available...|$|E
