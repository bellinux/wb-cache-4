500|$|Because {{the game}} was California's second tie, Stanford was chosen {{to play in the}} Rose Bowl on New Year's Day against the University of Notre Dame's Fighting Irish coached by Knute Rockne. Like Warner, Rockne is {{considered}} one of the greatest coaches in football history. According to journalist Allison Danzig, [...] "With the exception of Knute Rockne of Notre Dame, Pop Warner was the most publicized coach in football." [...] The game was thus a test of two different and highly influential systems of football: [...] "the Warner system with the wing backs, <b>unbalanced</b> <b>line</b> and gigantic power [...] Knute Rockne system with its rhythmic, dancing shift, lightning speed, balanced line and finely timed blocking". Notre Dame's backfield was composed of the renowned Four Horsemen. Nevers played all 60 minutes of the game, and rushed for [...] (more yardage than the Four Horsemen combined). Warner's offense moved the ball but was unable to score, and Notre Dame won 27–10.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{theory for}} the {{electromagnetic}} radiation from <b>unbalanced</b> transmission <b>lines</b> is developed. It is shown that radiation {{results from the}} convection current that develops in <b>unbalanced</b> transmission <b>lines</b> where the resistances of the lines are unequal. The process {{that leads to the}} generation of the nonlinear convection current in <b>unbalanced</b> transmission <b>lines</b> is explained. It is proved that the classical transmission line theory is not valid for <b>unbalanced</b> <b>lines.</b> The convection current and the radiation forces are included in the transmission line equations to develop a generalized model valid for all twoconductor transmission lines. The generalized model is validated via comparisons of its numerical solutions with laboratory measurements. 1...|$|R

50|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, an <b>unbalanced</b> <b>line</b> is {{a transmission}} line, often coaxial cable, whose conductors have unequal impedances {{with respect to}} ground; {{as opposed to a}} balanced line. Microstrip and single-wire lines are also unbalanced lines.|$|E

50|$|AES3 (also {{known as}} AES/EBU) is a {{standard}} for the exchange of digital audio signals between professional audio devices. AES3 was jointly developed by the Audio Engineering Society (AES) and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). An AES3 signal can carry two channels of PCM audio over several transmission media including balanced <b>lines,</b> <b>unbalanced</b> <b>lines,</b> and optical fiber. The standard {{was first published in}} 1985 and has been revised in 1992 and 2003.|$|R
50|$|Slotline is {{essentially}} a balanced line, unlike stripline and microstrip, which are <b>unbalanced</b> <b>lines.</b> This format makes it particularly easy to connect components to the line in shunt; surface mount components can be mounted bridging across the line. Another advantage of slotline is that high impedance lines are easier to achieve. Characteristic impedance increases with line width (compare microstrip where it decreases with width) {{so there is no}} issue with printing resolution for high impedance lines.|$|R
50|$|<b>Unbalanced</b> <b>lines</b> were {{formerly}} much {{used for}} telegraph transmission, but {{this form of}} communication has now fallen into disuse. Cables are similar to twisted pair in that many cores are bundled into the same cable but only one conductor is provided per circuit {{and there is no}} twisting. All the circuits on the same route use a common path for the return current (earth return). There is a power transmission version of single-wire earth return in use in many locations.|$|R

50|$|Any {{line that}} has a {{different}} impedance of the return path may be considered an <b>unbalanced</b> <b>line.</b> However, unbalanced lines usually consist of a conductor that is considered the signal line and another conductor that is grounded, or is ground itself.

For this reason the ground conductor may be referred to as common.|$|E

50|$|The {{center is}} {{the player who}} begins the play from {{scrimmage}} by snapping {{the ball to the}} quarterback. As the name suggests, the center usually plays {{in the middle of the}} offensive line, though some teams may employ an <b>unbalanced</b> <b>line</b> where the center is offset to one side or another. Like all offensive linemen, the center has the responsibility to block defensive players. The center often also has the responsibility to call out blocking assignments and make last second adjustments depending on the defensive alignment.|$|E
50|$|The single-wing {{formation}} {{was designed}} to place double-team blocks {{at the point of}} attack. Gaining this extra blocker was achieved in several ways. First, the <b>unbalanced</b> <b>line</b> placed an extra guard or tackle {{on one side of the}} center. Second, a wingback stationed outside end could quickly move to a crucial blocking position. Third, the fullback and especially the quarterback could lead the ball carrier producing interference. Finally, linemen, usually guards, would pull at the snap and block at the specified hole. Line splits were always close except for ends who might move out from the tackle.|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} on buffer stock allocation strategies in serial production lines is reviewed. A number of experiments are conducted {{to analyze the}} behavior of work-in-process inventory, given that {{the objective is to}} maximize throughput. Both balanced and <b>unbalanced</b> <b>lines</b> are examined. The long-pull, or constant work-in-process inventory, kanban system is introduced and applied to both serial and merging lines. It is demonstrated that the long-pull strategy outperforms other allocation strategies. The key idea is to control the total level of inventory and not the individual buffers. This less constrained policy has a positive impact on throughput. The long-pull concept is equivalent to the drum-buffer-rope approach of the Theory of Constraints of Goldratt and Cox (1986) status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} designs for {{impedance}} matching using an autotransformer, {{which is a}} single-wire transformer with different connection points or taps spaced along the windings. They are distinguished mainly by their impedance transform ratio (1:1, 1:4, 1:9, etc., {{the square of the}} winding ratio), and whether the input and output sides share a common ground, or are matched from a cable that is grounded on one side (unbalanced) to an ungrounded (usually balanced) cable. When autotransformers connect balanced and <b>unbalanced</b> <b>lines</b> they are called baluns, just as two-winding transformers. When two differently-grounded cables or circuits must be connected but the grounds kept independent, a full, two-winding transformer with the desired ratio is used instead.|$|R
50|$|In {{telecommunications}} and professional audio, a balanced line or balanced signal pair is a transmission line {{consisting of two}} conductors of the same type, each of which have equal impedances along their lengths and equal impedances to ground and to other circuits. The chief advantage of the balanced line format is good rejection of external noise when fed to a differential amplifier. Common forms of balanced line are twin-lead, used for radio frequency signals and twisted pair, used for lower frequencies. They are to be contrasted to <b>unbalanced</b> <b>lines,</b> such as coaxial cable, {{which is designed to}} have its return conductor connected to ground, or circuits whose return conductor actually is ground. Balanced and unbalanced circuits can be interconnected using a transformer called a balun.|$|R
50|$|The Notre Dame Box is a {{variation}} of the single-wing formation used in American football, with great success by Notre Dame in college football and the Green Bay Packers of the 1920s and 1930s in the NFL. Green Bay's coach, Curly Lambeau, learned the Notre Dame Box while playing for Knute Rockne in the late 1910s. Rockne learned it from Jesse Harper, who learned it from coach Amos Alonzo Stagg. It contained two tight ends, and 4 backs. The formation often featured an <b>unbalanced</b> <b>line</b> where the center (that is, the player who snapped the ball) was not strictly {{in the center of the}} line, but close to the weakside.|$|E
5000|$|A {{transition}} from a balanced to an <b>unbalanced</b> <b>line</b> requires a balun circuit. An {{example of this is}} CPW to slotline. Example D in the diagram shows this kind of transition and features a balun consisting of a dielectric radial stub. The component shown thus [...] in this circuit is an air bridge bonding the two CPW ground planes together. All transitions have some insertion loss and add to the complexity of the design. It is sometimes advantageous to design with a single integrated format for the whole device to minimise the number of transitions even when the compromise format is not optimum for each of the component circuits.|$|E

Devaney and Osborne revamped the offensive scheme, an I formation with an <b>unbalanced</b> <b>line,</b> and upgraded the recruiting effort. Nebraska began the 1969 season with just a 2-2 start and in its fifth game needed a last-minute comeback at home to beat a Kansas team that finished the season 1-9.
