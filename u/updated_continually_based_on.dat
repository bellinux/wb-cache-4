40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we present}} a {{high-level}} feedback control algorithm for rapid imaging in atomic force microscopy (AFM). This algorithm is designed for samples which are string-like, such as DNA and biopolymers. The tip control of the microscope is performed in real-time while probing the unknown sample <b>based</b> <b>on</b> feedback from the tip and {{a model of the}} sample. This model is <b>continually</b> <b>updated</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the measurements. To avoid exciting unwanted dynamics in the AFM system, the tip is steered at a constant velocity along a sinusoidal trajectory whose average is the estimate of the sample curve. We discuss the advantages of the algorithm and some of the challenges which must be overcome to make this technique a viable approach to AFM imaging. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—With recent {{advances}} in smartphones and wearable sensors, Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) have been proposed for use in continuous, remote electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring. In such systems, sampling the ECG at clinically recommended rates (250 Hz) and wireless transmission of the collected data incurs high energy consumption at the energy-constrained body sensor. The large volume of collected data also makes data storage at the sensor infeasible. Thus, {{there is a need}} for reducing the energy consumption and data size at the sensor, while maintaining the ECG quality required for diagnosis. In this paper, we propose GeM-REM, a resource-efficient ECG monitoring method for BSNs. GeM-REM uses a generative ECG model at the base station and its lightweight version at the sensor. The sensor transmits data only when the sensed ECG deviates from modelbased values, thus saving transmission energy. Further, the model parameters are <b>continually</b> <b>updated</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the sensed ECG. The proposed approach enables storage of ECG data in terms of model parameters rather than data samples, which reduces the required storage space. Implementation on a sensor platform and evaluation using real ECG data from MIT-BIH dataset shows transmission energy and data storage reduction ratios of 42. 1 : 1 and 37. 3 : 1 respectively, which are better than state of the art ECG data compression schemes.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Load {{modeling}} {{that can}} accurately represent the dynamic behavior of generators and loads {{is important in}} the operation and planning of transmission and distribution systems. Yet, it is a complex subject in power system research communities and electric utilities. The composition of the end-use loads is changing <b>continually</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> climate zone, season, and time. The WECC composite load model has been developed recently to better represent Fault Induced Delayed Voltage Recovery (FIDVR) events, which is caused by air-conditioning stalling phenomena. The approach is <b>based</b> <b>on</b> using the information of the load class at the substation level and composition of air-conditioning, induction machines, power electronics, and static loads associated with the load class. Therefore, {{it is important to be}} able to identify and classify the load class. This can be accomplished by using machine learning based signature detection since each load class has a unique signature response due to a particular disturbance in the system. The objective of this project is to implement a supervised learning, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), algorithm to detect and classify the composite load signatures in terms of residential, commercial, agriculture, and mixed load class. Furthermore, the process of creating WECC composite load model data, using the Load Model Data Tool (LMDT), to be used in time-domain dynamic simulation (PSS/E) is demonstrated. The One-Area Reliability Test System is used for the purpose of demonstration and validation of our proposed methodology.
