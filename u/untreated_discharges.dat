SWMM allows continuous simulations using historical rainfall series, which can be applied on a verified model in order to assess the risk of bad management practices and to design sustainable strategies in rural and suburban areas.

Significance of difference among concentrations measured {{before and after}} summertime are explored in order to evaluate effects related to tourism exploitation. Among surfactants, methylene blue active anionic substances (MBAS) are selected as tracers for <b>untreated</b> <b>discharges</b> originated by domestic and urban activities. Water samplings were performed in 2011 following a randomly replicated nested logic model (n = 144). MBAS mean level of 0. 070 mg. L – 1 (– 1) and 0. 530 mg. L – 1 (– 1) are respectively recorded in June and October evidencing a significant increase after the touristic season. Possible MBAS concentration phenomena could be induced by different evaportaton rates among sampling stations and between winter and summer seasons and were evaluated, in this study, using water salinity as possible factor affecting samples segregations.

However, the literature about the phenol toxicity {{at the level of}} ecosystem is only scanty (Saha et al. 1999; Hwang et al. 1986). Photolysis is the most important transformation process for the polychlorinated phenols. They further suggested that microbial degradation and winter photolysis rates are lesser than those of summer. Eklund and Kautsky (2003) described that macro-algae are more susceptible to phenol than other aquatic life forms. The mean levels of phenol in seawater were 0.61  mg/l while that of the sediment was 8.11  mg/kg. The highest value of phenol concentration (0.82  mg/l) was observed at KC- 24 while in sediment it was at KC- 17 (9.72  mg/kg). Phenol is often considered as one of the major component of industrial wastewater particularly that of chemical industry. In addition, phenol is also present in appreciable quantity in the discharges of metal industry, pharmaceutical, paint and varnish industries, textile industries, etc., (Navarro et al. 2008). It is evident from the phenol concentration in seawater and the sediment that the elevated concentrations of phenol are mainly due to the <b>untreated</b> <b>discharges</b> of industrial origin from the Korangi industrial area.

40|$|Wastewater {{treatment}} plants (WWTPs) {{play an important}} role within the urbanwater cycle in protecting receiving waters from <b>untreated</b> <b>discharges.</b> However, WWTPs processes also affect the environment. Life cycle assessment has traditionally been used {{to assess the impact of}} direct discharges from WWTPs and indirect emissions related to energy or chemical production. The water footprint (WF) can provide complementary information to evaluate the impact of a WWTP regarding the use of freshwater. This paper presents the adoption of the Water Footprint Assessment methodology to assess the consumption of water resources in WWTPs by considering both blue and grey WFs. The usefulness of the proposed methodology in assessing the environmental impact and the benefits from WWTP discharge to a river is illustrated with an actual WWTP, which treats 4, 000 m 3 $d 1, using three scenarios: no treatment, secondary treatment and phosphorus removal. A reduction of the water footprint by 51. 5 % and 72. 4 % was achieved using secondary treatment and chemical phosphorus removal, respectively, to fulfill the legal limits.

40|$|Problem statement: The {{analysis}} of the relationships among the different hydrogeological Units and the assessment of groundwater quality are fundamental to adopt suitable territorial planning measures aimed to reduce the potential groundwater pollution especially in agricultural regions. In this study, the characteristics of groundwater dynamics and the assessment of its quality in the Cuneo Plain (NW Italy) were examined. Approach: In order to define the geological setting an intense bibliographic analysis has been performed by the authors. This analysis was implemented by several correlated land controls and specific surveys that have permitted to analyze to certain reliability the Quaternary evolution of the entire plain sector and the current relationships among the different geological bodies that strongly affect the groundwater dynamics. Results: The Quaternary alluvial deposits overlap a Tertiary sedimentary succession {{through a series of}} erosional unconformity surfaces. These Quaternary deposits highlight a variable thickness ranging from 80 - 100 m {{in the foothills of the}} mountains up to a few meters in the more distal portion of the plain. In these deposits there are several unconfined aquifers which are not hydraulically interconnected due to the deep fluvial incisions that reach the underlying tertiary substrate. The Cuneo plain is intensively populated and lot of villages and farms characterize the landscape. In the overall area it is present an intensive agricultural and livestock activity predominantly represented by crops of wheat and corn and farms of cattle and pigs. All these activities represent point and diffuse groundwater pollution sources and require a considerable amount of groundwater which is withdrawn from the Quaternary aquifers by means of thousands of water wells. The groundwater quality is strongly influenced by the content of nitrates and manganese. The nitrates are linked to pollution due to agricultural activities and livestock and increase along the groundwater flow lines. The manganese content is quite high in the foothills of the mountains and in some restricted areas of the plain and appears to be linked to the natural litho logical composition of the aquifers. Conclusion: Due to high degree of intrinsic aquifers vulnerability over the entire Cuneo plain sector in order to reduce the actual groundwater pollution and the risk for human health it has to be planned several territorial suitable planning actions aimed to limit nitrates effluents and livestock <b>untreated</b> <b>discharges</b> according with the European rules...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to apply a coupled hydrodynamic-ecological model to a peat-stained and shallow (~ 4 m maximum depth) eutrophic lake whose catchment is likely to be subject to urban expansion associated with the development of Hamilton city, Waikato, New Zealand. The in-lake modelling was designed to increase understanding of the lake ecosystem and potentially to influence planning and management decisions associated with the prospective urban development project being undertaken by the Hamilton City Council (HCC). The overarching goal of the development is to accommodate urban expansion whilst retaining and enhancing the existing natural resources of Lake Rotokauri and Waiwhakareke Lake, and to restore the ecological value of the Rotokauri catchment. The main {{objective of}} this study was to understand the relationship between lake water quality and the effects of change of land-use from pastoral to urban within the Rotokauri catchment. This study incorporated results from a twelve-month programme of field work undertaken independently to the present study, into empirical calculations and computer modelling related to the catchment water budget and nutrient load, as well as the lake water quality. The fieldwork included the collection of water samples at set depths from Lake Rotokauri for the analysis of total and dissolved nutrients, chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen concentrations, and water temperature. On each sampling occasion a Secchi depth was measured. The surface flow measurements and nutrient loadings via the inflows were obtained as part of a water budget calculation for the lake as well as from previous studies that used both field measurements and models to derive nutrient concentrations and loads. An empirical water budget for Lake Rotokauri was developed to estimate the groundwater and outflow discharge as there were no gaugings that could be applied to input these variables into the lake model. Meteorological data for Lake Rotokauri was obtained from the National Institute of Water and Atmosphere Limited database, based on measurement at the Ruakura meteorological station. Meteorological data, inflows (including empirically estimated groundwater and measured surface water discharges to the lake) and the calculated outflow were entered as daily inputs to the DYRESM-CAEDYM lake model for the period of 2009. The available data relating to 2009 were looped for 2010 to check the stability of the model and its ability to capture repeated inter-annual dynamics that would be expected with identical annual forcing data input. DYRESM is a one-dimensional hydrodynamic model that predicts the vertical distribution of temperature, density and salinity. CAEDYM is an aquatic ecological model which was coupled with DYRESM as its hydrodynamic driver to simulate transport and mixing, and output temperature and biogeochemical parameters associated with lake water quality. The model satisfactorily simulated both the surface (0 m) and bottom (3 m) water temperature and the seasonal trends including the occasional stratification periods observed through spring to autumn. The model simulations showed greater departures from field data in simulating the dynamics of biogeochemical variables, particularly the seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton. The conceptual seasonal succession in phytoplankton communities depicts dominance of cyanobacteria in summer and diatoms in winter. In the observed data for Lake Rotokauri diatoms were found to be the dominant group throughout the year. The calibrated model was able to show diatoms to be the dominant group over cyanobacterial blooms. The agreement between concentrations of nitrate and dissolved reactive phosphorus in the water column was better than for chlorophyll a, and the observed magnitude and seasonal fluctuations at both depths (0 and 3 m) were captured reasonably well by the model simulations. The total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were under and over-estimated, respectively. Dissolved reactive phosphorus (PO 4) was overestimated perhaps as a result of insufficient uptake of phosphorus by the two phytoplankton groups. As the present model does not contain a dynamic description of sediment dynamics, the sediment phosphorus release rates were influenced by user-defined maximum phosphorus release rate, temperature and the oxygen concentration in the overlying waters. Concentrations of ammonium were underestimated but it represented a relatively small proportion of TN. Due to wind-induced mixing and sediment resuspension, as well as convective sediment-water heat exchanges, phosphorus may be released from the bottom sediments where it has previously sedimented out. The model simulations may not have captured these internal loads of phosphorus adequately as sediment resuspension, for example, was not explicitly included in the model configuration. To depict the future water quality of Lake Rotokauri when subjected to urbanisation, three scenarios were developed which involved simulations with altered nutrient loads to DYRESM-CAEDYM and comparisons with the calibrated model which represented a ‘base’ or present case of water quality. The scenarios considered the water quality that could evolve during and after urban development, and with a range of mitigation measures, from relatively modest treatment to best management practices to reduce nutrient loads and attenuate water flows to the lake. The predicted nutrient load contributed from future urban run-off was less than the nutrient load from the pastoral run-off in all scenarios. The model indicated that the nutrient loading from a future catchment with little or modest treatment of the urban area (Scenario I) would be only slightly poorer water quality than Scenario II which examined the water quality during the construction phase. Scenario III (treated water) was most effective in reducing nutrient loads to Lake Rotokauri. At 3 m depth dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations showed large fluctuations throughout the year for the both the base and untreated discharge scenarios. Chlorophyll a (chl a) concentrations for the untreated scenario were greater than in the base scenario. The timing of peak chl a concentrations between base and <b>untreated</b> <b>discharges</b> differed by a few days. The TP, TN and nitrate (NO 3 -N) concentrations of the base scenario were greater than the untreated scenario. Scenario II represented the intermediate stage towards Scenario 3 which was the optimal treatment case for the catchment. The greatest difference in DO at 0 m between the base case and scenario II was in March (i. e., base-intermediate = 2. 76 mg L- 1). At 3 m depth, Lake Rotokauri was predicted to be anoxic on 4 July 2011 (0. 18 mg L- 1) for scenario II. Chlorophyll a concentrations for scenario 2 were lower than the base case and PO 4 -P concentrations were higher. Concentrations of NO 3 -N and NH 4 -N at 3 m depth for scenario II were lower than the base case. Scenario III involved simulating water quality from with best management practices implemented. These practices included detention basins (grass-lined), constructed wetlands, biofiltration swales and floodways. At 3 m depth, fluctuations in DO concentration for both the base and scenario III were similar at the beginning of the simulated period, but for the months of May to November DO was lower in Scenario III than the base case. The maximum chl a for scenario 3 peaked at 30. 8 μgL- 1 compared to 38. 9 μg L- 1 observed in the base model. The TP and TN concentrations were substantially lower in Scenario III than the base model. Concentrations of PO 4 -P at 3 m depth were low for most of the year except in March. At 0 m depth the NH 4 -N concentrations were greater than the base model from mid-June to July. Concentrations of NO 3 -N for the treated scenario at 0 m depth were approximately 25 % less than the base model. Future studies should consider an ongoing comprehensive and consistent monitoring plan that would emphasise any change in the water quality of Lake Rotokauri during and/or after high-density urban developments within the catchment. Future works should involve regular monitoring that would not only limit the uncertainties in the data but also account for any effects that may be attributable to the management plan. Restoration plans should also be considered to explore the effects of biomanipulation and re-establishment of submerged vegetation.
