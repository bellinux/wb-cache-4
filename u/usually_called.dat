5|$|Grammar is {{the study}} of how {{meaningful}} elements called morphemes within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be free or bound. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are <b>usually</b> <b>called</b> words, and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are called affixes. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words are called morphology. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called syntax.|$|E
5|$|In 1941 the British Admiralty started {{receiving}} {{reports that}} German submarines {{were using the}} rivers in Vichy French parts of Africa {{as a base for}} refuelling. The unit selected to investigate the reports was the Small Scale Raiding Force (SSRF) also known as No. 62 Commando. The SSRF was formed in 1941, and consisted {{of a small group of}} 55 commando-trained personnel working with the Special Operations Executive (SOE). While being under operational control of Combined Operations Headquarters, No. 62 Commando itself was under the command Major Gustavus Henry March-Phillipps, <b>usually</b> <b>called</b> Gus March-Phillipps.|$|E

5|$|In Jainism, Kubera is the {{attendant}} Yaksha of the 19th Tirthankar Mallinath. He is <b>usually</b> <b>called</b> Sarvanubhuti or Sarvahna, {{and may be}} depicted with four faces, rainbow colours and eight arms. The Digambara sect of Jainism gives him six weapons and three heads; while the Svetambaras portray him with four to six arms, numerous choices of weapons, though his attributes, the money bag and citron fruit are consistent. He may ride a man or an elephant. He {{is related to the}} Buddhist Jambhala rather than the Hindu Kubera.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd-century-BCE {{tomb of the}} Lady Dai {{contained}} {{not only}} decayed remnants of actual food, such as rice, wheat, barley, two varieties of millet, and soybeans, but also a grave inventory with recipes on it. This included vegetable and meat stews cooked in pots, which had combinations such as beef and rice stew, dog meat and celery stew, and even deer, fish, and bamboo shoot stew. Seasonings mentioned in the recipes include sugar, honey, soy sauce, and salt. Recipes in the Han <b>usually</b> <b>called</b> for meat stuffed in cereals, cakes, and other wrappings.|$|E
5|$|The Elves of the Third Clan, or Teleri, {{who reached}} Eldamar {{later than the}} Noldor and the Vanyar, spoke a {{different}} but closely related tongue, <b>usually</b> <b>called</b> Telerin. It was seen by some Elves to be just another dialect of Quenya. This {{was not the case}} with the Teleri for whom their tongue was distinct from Quenya. After the Vanyar left the city of Túna, Telerin and Noldorin Quenya grew closer.|$|E

5|$|The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) uses two 4-km Michelson-Fabry-Pérot interferometers for the {{detection}} of gravitational waves. In this application, the Fabry–Pérot cavity is used to store photons for almost a millisecond while they bounce up and down between the mirrors. This increases the time a gravitational wave can interact with the light, which results in a better sensitivity at low frequencies. Smaller cavities, <b>usually</b> <b>called</b> mode cleaners, are used for spatial filtering and frequency stabilization of the main laser. The first observation of gravitational waves occurred on September 14, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists {{since the}} 1960s have {{distinguished}} brochs from smaller structures of similar construction, <b>usually</b> <b>called</b> duns. The heaviest {{evidence of the}} occupation of crannogs was in this era, but they {{would continue to be}} used until the Middle Ages. This period also saw the beginnings of wheelhouses, a roundhouse with a characteristic outer wall, within which was a circle of stone piers (bearing a resemblance to the spokes of a wheel), but these would flourish most in the era of Roman occupation. There is evidence for about 1,000 Iron Age hillforts in Scotland, most located below the Clyde-Forth line. The majority are circular, with a single palisade around an enclosure. Most are relatively small, covering one or two acres, but some are much larger as at Castle O'er, Birrenwark, Cadimuir, Cadroner and White Meldon. They appear to have been largely abandoned in the Roman period, but some seem to have been reoccupied after their departure.|$|E
5|$|By September 1963, Waters and Mason {{had lost}} {{interest}} in their studies and moved into the lower flat of Stanhope Gardens, owned by Mike Leonard, a part-time tutor at the Regent Street Polytechnic. Waters, Mason and Wright first played music together in late 1963, in a band formed by vocalist Keith Noble and bassist Clive Metcalfe. They <b>usually</b> <b>called</b> themselves Sigma6, but also used the name the Meggadeaths. Waters played rhythm guitar and Mason played drums, Wright played on any keyboard he could arrange to use, and Noble's sister Sheilagh provided an occasional vocal accompaniment. In the early years the band performed during private functions and rehearsed in a tearoom {{in the basement of}} Regent Street Polytechnic.|$|E

50|$|In Andrews' {{experiments}} on phase transitions, he showed that carbon dioxide may be carried {{from any of}} the states we <b>usually</b> <b>call</b> liquid to any of those we <b>usually</b> <b>call</b> gas, without losing homogeneity. The mathematical physicist Willard Gibbs cited these results in support of the Gibbs free energy equation. They also set off a race among researchers to liquify various other gases. In 1877-78 Louis Paul Cailletet was the first to liquefy oxygen and nitrogen.|$|R
5|$|Cirrus {{comes in}} four {{distinct}} species; Cirrus castellanus, fibratus, spissatus, and uncinus; which are each {{divided into four}} varieties: intortus, vertebratus, radiatus, and duplicatus. Cirrus castellanus is a species that has cumuliform tops caused by high-altitude convection rising up from the main cloud body. Cirrus fibratus looks striated and {{is the most common}} cirrus species. Cirrus uncinus clouds are hooked and are the form that is <b>usually</b> <b>called</b> mare's tails. Of the varieties, Cirrus intortus has an extremely contorted shape, and cirrus radiatus has large, radial bands of cirrus clouds that stretch across the sky. Kelvin–Helmholtz waves are a form of cirrus intortus that has been twisted into loops by vertical wind shear.|$|E
5|$|Miss Honora Sneyd {{would not}} admit the {{unqualified}} {{control of a}} husband over all her actions; she did not feel, that seclusion from society was indispensably necessary to preserve female virtue, or to secure domestic happiness. Upon terms of reasonable equality, she supposed, that mutual confidence might best subsist; she said, that, as Mr Day had decidedly declared his determination to live in perfect seclusion from what is <b>usually</b> <b>called</b> the world, it was fit she should decidedly declare, {{that she would not}} change her present mode of life, with which she had no reason to be dissatisfied, for any dark and untried system, that could be proposed to her.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{discussion}} in this article has focused on one style or tradition of philosophy in modern Western culture, <b>usually</b> <b>called</b> analytic philosophy (sometimes described as Anglo-American philosophy). Many other schools of thought exist, however, which are sometimes subsumed under the broad (and vague) label of continental philosophy. In any case, though topics and methods here are numerous, {{in relation to the}} philosophy of mind the various schools that fall under this label (phenomenology, existentialism, etc.) can globally be seen to differ from the analytic school in that they focus less on language and logical analysis alone but also take in other forms of understanding human existence and experience. With reference specifically to {{the discussion}} of the mind, this tends to translate into attempts to grasp the concepts of thought and perceptual experience in some sense that does not merely involve the analysis of linguistic forms.|$|E

5|$|Skyscraper {{development}} paused {{during the}} years of the Second World War. Once development began again in the 1950s and 1960s, the skyscraper entered a different phase of development, <b>usually</b> <b>called</b> the international or modern period. Some experimental designs in this style had been built in the U.S. using European architectural concepts in the early 1930s, most notably the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society and McGraw-Hill Buildings. Post-war, their modernist themes were used in a new generation of skyscrapers. These stood alone on individual plots in the fashion of the Rockefeller Centre's RCA building, rather than as part of a row of buildings, forming huge slabs and towers featuring huge glass façades, breaking with earlier skyscraper traditions. Inside, new technologies such as fluorescent lighting and widespread air-conditioning meant that many older architectural features such as light courts and operable windows were unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Some {{non-standard}} USB devices use the 5V {{power supply}} without {{participating in a}} proper USB network, which negotiates power draw with the host interface. These are <b>usually</b> <b>called</b> USB decorations. Examples include USB-powered keyboard lights, fans, mug coolers and heaters, battery chargers, miniature vacuum cleaners, and even miniature lava lamps. In most cases, these items contain no digital circuitry, and thus are not standard-compliant USB devices. This may cause problems with some computers, such as drawing too much current and damaging circuitry. Prior to the USB Battery Charging Specification, the USB specification required that devices connect in a low-power mode (100mA maximum) and communicate their current requirements to the host, which then permits the device to switch into high-power mode.|$|E
5|$|The Foundation Stone of the Monument to the Early Founders of Singapore, <b>usually</b> <b>called</b> the Early Founders Memorial Stone is a {{national}} memorial that {{is dedicated to the}} early founders ("Unknown Immigrants") of Singapore. The original idea was raised by a graduates' association and an open design competition was held for the memorial project. The foundation stone was initially erected along Collyer Quay Street outside the Fullerton Hotel in 1970. After a series of setbacks and delays, the project was finally scrapped after no worthy design was accepted, which resulted the foundation stone becoming the memorial afterwards. In 2000, the memorial was relocated to the National Archives of Singapore at Canning Rise before moving back to the grounds of The Fullerton Hotel in 2010.|$|E
