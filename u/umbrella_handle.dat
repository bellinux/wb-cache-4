60|$|This {{creature}} {{was at once}} the pride and terror of the Kingdom of Spor. It was more than thirty feet in length and covered everywhere with large green scales set with diamonds, making the dragon, when it moved, a very glittering spectacle. Its eyes were as big as pie-plates, and its mouth--when wide opened--fully {{as large as a}} bath-tub. Its tail was very long and ended in a golden ball, such as you see on the top of flagstaffs. Its legs, which were as thick as those of an elephant, had scales which were set with rubies and emeralds. It had two monstrous, big ears and two horns of carved ivory, and its teeth were also carved into various fantastic shapes--such as castles, horses' heads, chinamen and griffins--so that if any of them broke it would make an excellent <b>umbrella</b> <b>handle.</b>|$|E

It was calf-length, straight, and decorated only by a few diagonal lines. Vogue called it [...] "Chanel’s Ford,” as like the Model T, the little black dress was simple and accessible for women of all social classes. To accessorize the little black dress, Chanel revamped her designs, thus facilitating the breakthrough and mass popularity of costume jewelry. Galalith was used for striking Art Deco jewelry designs by artists such as Jacob Bengel and Auguste Bonaz, as well as for hair combs and accessories. By the 1930s, Galalith was also used for pens, <b>umbrella</b> <b>handles,</b> white piano keys (replacing natural ivory), and electrical goods, with world production at that time reaching 10,000 tons. Knitting needles were another common use.|$|R

5000|$|Pear wood {{is one of}} the {{preferred}} materials in the manufacture of high-quality woodwind instruments and furniture, and was used for making the carved blocks for woodcuts. It is also used for wood carving, and as a firewood to produce aromatic smoke for smoking meat or tobacco. Pear wood is valued for kitchen spoons, scoops and stirrers, as it does not contaminate food with color, flavor or smell, and resists warping and splintering despite repeated soaking and drying cycles. Lincoln describes it as [...] "a fairly tough, very stable wood... (used for) carving... brushbacks, <b>umbrella</b> <b>handles,</b> measuring instruments such as set squares and T-squares... recorders... violin and guitar fingerboards and piano keys... decorative veneering." [...] Pearwood is the favored wood for architect's rulers because it does not warp. It is similar to the wood of its relative, the apple tree (Malus domestica) and used for many of the same purposes.|$|R

Prior to production, most bamboo is soaked in water to eliminate the sugar for a month. Then they are dried under the sun to prevent infection of bugs. After cutting and slicing, they become the fundamental scaffold of the umbrella, with additional modifications such as <b>umbrella</b> head, <b>handle</b> and hole drilling for stitching. After the scaffold production, the wax is applied onto the surface as well as the sides.

60|$|It resembles, you see, {{a closed}} <b>umbrella</b> without a <b>handle,</b> {{and it has}} cords at the bottom, to which a car is attached.

60|$|If the {{inversion}} be {{not precisely}} {{of the kind}} he expected, it is none the less striking, and impressibly more real. If personal experience has definitely convinced him that the inhabitants of that under side of our planet do not adhere to it head downwards, like flies on a ceiling,--his early a priori deduction,--they still appear quite as antipodal, mentally considered. Intellectually, at least, their attitude sets gravity at defiance. For to the mind's eye their world is one huge, comical antithesis of our own. What we regard intuitively in one way from our standpoint, they as intuitively observe in a diametrically opposite manner from theirs. To speak backwards, write backwards, read backwards, is but the a b c of their contrariety. The inversion extends deeper than mere modes of expression, down into the very matter of thought. Ideas of ours which we deemed innate find in them no home, while methods which strike us as preposterously unnatural appear to be their birthright. From the standing of a wet <b>umbrella</b> on its <b>handle</b> instead of its head to dry to the striking of a match away in place of toward one, {{there seems to be}} no action of our daily lives, however trivial, but finds with them its appropriate reaction--equal but opposite. Indeed, to one anxious of conforming to the manners and customs of the country, the only road to right lies in following unswervingly that course which his inherited instincts assure him to be wrong.|$|R
40|$|Glassy {{behavior}} {{is one of}} the main open problems in condensed matter physics. In this thesis, we approach the problem by studying spin-glasses and colloids, using several complementary strategies. From the point of view of model building, we propose a new model, the hypercube model, which is mean-field but defined in a metric space. We show that, also in Mean Field, the spin-glass non-equilibrium dynamics is a domain-growth process very similar to its three-dimensional counterpart. We also consider spin-glasses in three spatial dimensions, focusing on temperature chaos. Thanks to the low-temperature configurations equilibrated with Janus, we show that temperature chaos can be aptly described through a large-deviations functional. The finite-size scaling behavior can be predicted in details from this functional, including the pre-asymptotic regime where chaos is driven by rare events. We also address the problem of finding new, efficient algorithms to study glassy systems. In particular, in the context of the Quantum-Adiabatic algorithm we discuss strategies for bypassing the "first-order bottleneck". Our approach is successfully put to work on the p-spin ferromagnetic model. We also show how to use tethered Monte Carlo (a recent refinement of <b>Umbrella</b> Sampling) to <b>handle</b> problems with more than one order parameter, such as hard-spheres crystallization. We study the crystallization transition equilibrating the largest systems to date, and obtaining very accurate determinations of the coexistence pressure and the interfacial free-energy. We also show our efforts to characterize the solid phase in a system of soft spheres at very high polydispersity. Comment: PhD Thesis.

60|$|The {{catastrophe}} {{was terrific}} and instantaneous in its effect. The observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, {{all of the}} fifth grade of Mercalli's scale, {{and there is no}} record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534, the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas. The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn's Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch. All the lordly residences {{in the vicinity of the}} palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive. From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character. An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk <b>umbrella</b> with gold <b>handle</b> with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant's causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale. Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west. Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special missa pro defunctis shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst.
