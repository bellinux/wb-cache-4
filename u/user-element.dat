40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the imperfection and aspect-ratio sensitivity of the uniaxial strength of rectangular steel plates. To investigate the imperfection and aspect ratio sensitivity of the uniaxial strength of rectangular plates, over 90 different plate problems have been modelled and solved by using the <b>user-element</b> in ANSYS 5. 0 which is a commercial finite element package. The <b>user-element</b> which is offered by ANSYS 5. 0 {{as an extension of the}} element library, is used to implement subroutines written for analysing large deflection elastic-perfectlyplastic material behaviour of plates by using finite element method. The results obtained for each plate problem have been presented in figures. The maximum average strength of plates have been obtained for the different aspect ratios, the initial geometric imperfection modes and the complex initial geometric imperfections, achieved by combination of these modes. The levels of initial geometric imperfections are assumed as found in the literature. The effects of complex initial geometric imperfections and aspect ratios on plate strength for various modes have been determined. The combination of initial imperfection modes creates new geometrical imperfections and magnitudes, generally higher than previous values. These factors are shown to effect the plate by reducing its strength. The results obtained can help to design the rectangular plates and plated structures under uniaxial compression...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, a {{modeling}} {{strategy is}} proposed {{in order to}} identify the behavior of a two-node finite element connector. This connector is substituted for a complex three-dimensional bolted joint. A first connector model has been proposed and implemented in a <b>user-element</b> subroutine in ABAQUS CAE. Connector model identification was performed on an elementary single bolt joint under tensile and compressive loads. The result is a fine scale three-dimensional computation obtained using a mixed domain decomposition method which shares similar features with the augmented Lagrangian formulation in order to efficiently account for frictional contact conditions. It is shown that the dissipated energy as well as the cumulated displacement jumps between the parts of the assembly are in good agreement with the three-dimensional numerical simulation...|$|E
40|$|Perovskite {{ceramics}} {{with high}} oxygen ionic conductivity are important materials for ion-transport membranes (ITMs) for oxygen separation or syngas production, {{as well as}} for electrode materials in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) which operate at high temperatures (~ 500 – 1000 °C). These ceramics have the ability to be (reversibly) reduced at moderate partial pressures of oxygen, to produce high concentrations of oxygen ion vacancies. While these vacancies facilitate oxygen ion transport and oxygen surface exchange, they also lead to lattice volume expansion and mechanical stress [...] - a factor which is of critical importance in determining success or failure during the use of membranes made from these materials In order to optimize the design of ITMs and SOFCs, there is need for a theory and numerical simulation capability which couples chemical, thermal, and mechanical effects. Of particular importance is the specification of appropriate flux boundary conditions which account for the insertion (extraction) reactions at the boundaries—reactions which depend on the external partial pressure of oxygen, the local concentration of vacancies at the boundary, and the stress in the material. We have formulated such a coupled theory. The fully-coupled theory is implemented in the commercially available finite-element software Abaqus through the development of custom <b>user-elements.</b> Using this simulation capability we have studied the transport of oxygen ions through a representative ITM membrane. Our study shows the importance of stress on the diffusion of vacancies through the ITM, and also shows that a proper accounting for the effect of stress on the surface reactions is crucial in developing a model that can fit experimentally available data. We have also developed a simplified one-dimensional model that may be solved efficiently without the need for finite-element simulations. We have used our full finite element implementation to check the range of validity of our simple one-dimensional model. The simple one-dimensional model represents an important tool for the engineering design of ITM membranes since it is computationally inexpensive, and may thus be used to quickly simulate a variety of designs. We conclude by using our theory, its finite element implementation, and our simplified one-dimensional model to conduct a parametric study to determine the importance of various key design parameters which affect the performance of ITMs...|$|R

The environment is used to automatically program standard element formulations and develop new elements with novel features. Source code can also be exported in a format compatible with commercial finite element program <b>user-element</b> facilities. The development environment is demonstrated for three mixed Petrov-Galerkin plane stress elements: a standard formulation, an advanced formulation incorporating rotational degrees of freedom and a standard formulation in which the stiffness matrix is integrated analytically, before being exported as ANSYS user elements. The results presented illustrate {{the accuracy of the}} standard mixed formulation element and the enhancement of performance when rotational degrees of freedom are added. Further, the analytically integrated element shows that computational requirements can be greatly reduced when analytical integration schemes are used in the formation...|$|E
40|$|We {{formulate}} a unified framework of balance laws and thermodynamically consistent constitutive equations which couple Cahn–Hilliard-type species diffusion with large elastic deformations of a body. The traditional Cahn–Hilliard theory, {{which is based}} on the species concentration and its spatial gradient leads to a partial differential equation for the concentration which involves fourth-order spatial derivatives in the concentration; this necessitates use of basis functions in finite-element solution procedures that are piecewise smooth and globally C 1 -continuous. In order to use standard C 0 -continuous finite-elements to implement our phase-field model, we use a split method to reduce the fourth-order equation into two second-order partial differential equations (PDES). Specifically, we introduce an additional variable – as in the micromorphic theories of continua – and {{formulate a}} theory which depends on actual concentration, the micromorphic concentration, and the gradient of the micromorphic concentration. These two PDES, when taken together with the PDE representing the balance of forces, represent the three governing pdes for chemomechanically coupled problems. These equations are amenable to finite-element solution methods which employ standard C 0 -continuous finite-element basis functions. We have numerically implemented our theory by writing a <b>user-element</b> subroutine for the widely used finite-element program Abaqus/Standard. We use this numerically implemented theory to first study the diffusion-only problem of spinodal decomposition {{in the absence of any}} mechanical deformation. Next, we use our fully-coupled theory and numerical-implementation to study the combined effects of diffusion and stress on the lithiation of a representative spheroidal-shaped particle of a phase-separating electrode material...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBolted joints {{are widely}} {{encountered}} in mechanical engineering, especially in aeronautics (e. g. 3, 000, 000 joints on a A 380, 50, 000 on a Rafale). In spite of well-established design rules and assembly procedures, important sources of uncertainty remain {{due to a}} high sensitivity of the joint mechanical behaviour to dispersions (tightening procedure, frictional effects, geometrical tolerances [...] .). Fine scale computations of bolted assemblies accounting for these uncertainties are generally too costly and hardly tractable within an optimization process. Thus, {{a wide range of}} FE connectors or user-elements are usually used or developed in FE commercial code by engineers to propose a simplified model for bolts. The connector behaviour is generally identified from fine scale 3 D computations on an elementary bolded joint and/or from experimental tests. However, identification is often limited to the elastic part of the behaviour and for a given set of loadings and design parameters. In specific situations, simplified analytical models exist but they mainly address linear dynamic or quasistatic problems. In this work, a nonlinear FE connector with its identification methodology is proposed to model the behaviour of a bolt joint. Model parameters are based on design parameters (bolt prestress, friction coefficient, clearance, bolt dimensions [...] .). Axial connector behaviour models the preload effect and the axial bolt stiffness. Tangential connector behaviour accounts for frictional phenomena that occur in the bolt’s vicinity due to preload thanks to an elasto-plastic analogy for friction. Identification of tangential behaviour is performed on a generic elementary single bolt joint. Connector has been developed in SAMCEF through a fortran <b>user-element</b> subroutine. Comparisons between fine scale 3 D computations and simulations with connectors on various bolted assemblies will be proposed. In particular, it will be shown that dissipated energies are in good agreement...|$|E
40|$|This study {{develops}} strain-gradient theories for isotropic {{and crystal}} plasticity. The following four theories were developed and numerically implemented: * A one-dimensional theory {{to understand the}} basic nature of strain gradient theories; * A small deformation crystal plasticity theory; * A small deformation theory for isotropic viscoplastic materials; and, * A large deformation theory for isotropic viscoplastic materials. The theories are based on: (i) microstresses consistent with microforce balances; (ii) a mechanical version of the two laws of thermodynamics for isothermal conditions, that includes via the microstresses the work performed during viscoplastic flow; and (iii) a thermodynamically consistent constitutive theory. The microscopic force balance, when augmented by constitutive relations for the microscopic stresses, results in a nonlocal flow rule {{in the form of}} a second-order partial differential equation for the plastic strain. The flow rule, being nonlocal, requires microscopic boundary conditions. The theories are numerically implemented by writing a <b>user-element</b> for a commercial finite element program. Using this numerical capability, the major characteristics of the theory are revealed by studying the standard problem of simple shear of a constrained plate. Additional boundary-value problems representing idealized two-dimensional models of grain-size-strengthening and dispersion-strengthening of metallic materials are also studied using the small deformation version of the isotropic theory. For problems that do not involve boundary conditions on plastic strain, the flow rule may be considered to be in conventional form, with additional strengthening terms, instead of a partial differential equation. The finite deformation version of the isotropic theory is numerically implemented by writing a user material model for this approach. Using this implementation, the problems of stabilization of widths of localization shear bands, strengthening in pure bending, and depth dependence of micro and nano-indentation hardness are studied. by Suvrat Pratapsinh Lele.

40|$|The Refined Zigzag Theory (RZT) {{has been}} {{recently}} {{developed for the}} analysis of homogeneous, multilayer composite and sandwich plates. The theory has a number of practical and theoretical advantages over the widely used First-order Shear Deformation Theory (FSDT) and other types of higher-order and zigzag theories. Using FSDT as a baseline, RZT takes into account the stretching, bending, and transverse shear deformations. Unlike FSDT, this novel theory does not require shear correction factors to yield accurate results {{for a wide range of}} material systems including homogeneous, laminated composite, and sandwich laminates. The inplane zigzag kinematic assumptions, which compared to FSDT add two additional rotation-type kinematic variables, give rise to two types of transverse shear strain measures - the classical average shear strain (as in FSDT) and another one related to the cross-sectional distortions enabled by the zigzag kinematic terms. Consequently, with a fixed number of kinematic variables, the theory enables a highly accurate modeling of multilayer composite and sandwich plates even when the laminate stacking sequence exhibits a high degree of transverse heterogeneity. Unlike most zigzag formulations, this theory is not affected by such theoretical anomalies as the vanishing of transverse shear stresses and forces along clamped boundaries. In this paper, six- and three-node, C 0 -continuous, RZT-based triangular plate finite elements are developed; they provide the best compromise between computational efficiency and accuracy. The element shape functions are based on anisoparametric (aka interdependent) interpolations that ensure proper element behavior even when very thin plates are modeled. Continuous edge constraints are imposed on the transverse shear strain measures to derive coupled-field deflection shape functions, resulting in a simple and efficient three-node element. The elements are implemented in ABAQUS - a widely used commercial finite element code - by way of a <b>user-element</b> subroutine. The predictive capabilities of the new elements are assessed on several elasto-static problems, which include simply supported and cantilevered laminated composite and sandwich plates. The numerical results demonstrate that the new RZT-based elements provide superior predictions for modeling a wide range of laminates including highly heterogeneous sandwich laminations. They also offer substantial improvements over the existing plate elements based on FSDT as well as other higher-order and zigzag-type element...|$|E
40|$|The {{method of}} finite spheres is an {{effective}} overlapping finite element method developed to overcome challenges in mesh-based numerical methods. Commonly recognized challenges include mesh generation for geometrically complex domains, severe element distortion in nonlinear analysis with large strain effects, and modeling problems involving discontinuities and singularities which require mesh alignment and refinement. Substantial research efforts have been focused on addressing these issues, resulting in the introduction of numerous meshless methods. The ultimate purpose of the method of finite spheres is to be distinguished as a reliable and efficient meshless computational technique for the solution of boundary value problems on complex domains, to supplement {{the capabilities of the}} standard finite element method. The reliability of the method of finite spheres was previously verified for one- and two-dimensional linear static analysis of solids and fluids. The objective of this thesis is to demonstrate the reliability and effectiveness of the method of finite spheres for the solution of practical three-dimensional linear elasticity problems. An effective local approximation space, which is multiplied by the Shepard partition of unity function, is presented for the construction of three-dimensional interpolation functions. The piecewise Gauss-Legendre quadrature rule, a simple and efficient scheme for the integration of complicated non polynomial basis functions, is introduced for three-dimensional spherical domains. The three-dimensional formulation of the method of finite spheres is implemented in a commercial finite element analysis program with the <b>user-element</b> subroutine, in order to perform a computational efficiency comparison with the standard finite element method. A series of increasingly complex three-dimensional problems is studied (1) to establish the reliability of the method of finite spheres for practical three-dimensional linear elastic static problems and (2) to assess the effectiveness of the method of finite spheres as compared to the standard finite element method. Solution times indicate that the method of finite spheres is approximately an order of magnitude slower than the standard finite element method during the computation phase. However, this is still a promising result since there are significant time savings for the method of finite spheres during the pre-processing phase, particularly in the discretization of complicated three-dimensional geometries. by Benjamin Lai.
