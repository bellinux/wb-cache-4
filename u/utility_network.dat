500|$|As Danielle {{moved through}} the Lesser Antilles, a rainband struck the island of Saint Vincent with wind gusts of near hurricane-force. The winds caused a major power outage on the island, and {{destroyed}} the roofs of more than 30houses. Elsewhere in the country, the combination of winds and heavy rains caused heavy crop damage. Twelve days after Danielle struck, a severe rainstorm affected Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The combined disasters produced a damage total of $9.3million (1986USD, $18million 2010USD), the majority of it from crop damage. About 40% of the banana crop was destroyed or unfit for cultivation, and [...] of other crops were seriously affected. The two storms caused the deaths of 120animals, although there were no human fatalities. In addition to the crop damage, the combined impact of the two storms left over 100houses destroyed, {{with a total of}} 436dwellings damaged; this forced 142people to seek emergency shelter. Across the country, the heavy rainfall caused mudslides and flooding which disrupted the transportation and <b>utility</b> <b>network.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Utility</b> <b>networks</b> {{are part}} of every nation’s {{critical}} infrastructure, and their protection {{is now seen as}} a high priority objective. In this paper, we propose a threat awareness architecture for critical infrastructures, which we believe will raise security awareness and increase resilience in <b>utility</b> <b>networks.</b> We first describe an investigation of trends and threats that may impose security risks in <b>utility</b> <b>networks.</b> This was performed {{on the basis of a}} viewpoint approach that is capable of identifying technical and non-technical issues (e. g., behaviour of humans). The result of our analysis indicated that <b>utility</b> <b>networks</b> are affected strongly by technological trends, but that humans comprise an important threat to them. This provided evidence and confirmed that the protection of <b>utility</b> <b>networks</b> is a multi-variable problem, and thus, requires the examination of information stemming from various viewpoints of a network. In order to accomplish our objective, we propose a systematic threat awareness architecture in the context of a resilience strategy, which ultimately aims at providing and maintaining an acceptable level of security and safety in critical infrastructures. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate partially via a case study the application of the proposed threat awareness architecture, where we examine the potential impact of attacks in the context of social engineering in a European utility company...|$|R

40|$|One {{important}} aspect of modern critical infrastructures (CI) like power grids is that {{the control of the}} physical processes (e. g., electricity transmission) is no longer done locally but in a distributed way with SCADA/PCS systems. This distributed control is done over <b>utility</b> <b>networks,</b> typically wide-area IP networks, that interconnect the CI facilities (e. g., transformation substations). This communication is critical because, if certain commands are not executed within certain time bounds, events with a severe socioeconomic impact may happen (e. g., blackouts). However, <b>utility</b> <b>networks</b> often do not ensure the required timeliness and reliability, especially when accidental or malicious faults occur. This paper presents the Calm-Paranoid algorithm (CP), a novel overlay and multihoming routing strategy aimed to achieve adequate levels of timeliness and reliability in <b>utility</b> <b>networks,</b> even under harsh fault scenarios. 1...|$|R

50|$|There {{has been}} no broad {{assessment}} about water quality in Benin. Under {{the framework of a}} study which analyzed water supply in peri-urban areas of Cotonou, water samples were collected from water kiosks, a water seller, a communal well and Lake Nokoue in the peri-urban Cotonouan districts of Ladji and Vossa. The study concludes that the samples from the water kiosks and the water seller were of good quality. Private water sellers connected to the SONEB <b>utility</b> <b>network</b> are widespread in urban areas, serving households not yet connected to the grid. The Ministry in charge of water and SONEB have fixed a special ‘pro-poor’ tariff for water resale to regulate this phenomenon, in July 2009.

40|$|Cartographic {{visualizations}} {{of crises}} {{are used to}} create a Common Operational Picture (COP) and enforce Situational Awareness by presenting relevant information to the involved actors. As nearly all crises affect geospatial entities, geo-data representations have to support location-specific analysis throughout the decision-making process. Meaningful cartographic presentation is needed for coordinating the activities of crisis manager in a highly dynamic situation, since operators’ attention span and their spatial memories are limiting factors during the perception and interpretation process. Situational Awareness of operators in conjunction with a COP are key aspects in decision-making process and essential for making well thought-out and appropriate decisions. Considering <b>utility</b> <b>networks</b> {{as one of the most}} complex and particularly frequent required systems in urban environment, meaningful cartographic presentation of multiple <b>utility</b> <b>networks</b> with respect to disaster management do not exist.

50|$|Players {{have the}} ability to lay out where they want floors, as well as place where they want staircases, elevators, and {{utilities}} to be in their high-rise, whereupon a construction crew builds them before they can be properly utilized by the building's residents and visitors; new floors won't be built, until they have a staircase or elevator connecting them {{to the rest of the}} building. For the four main room types - offices, shops, restaurants and apartments - players must wait until a floor is built before they can lay these down, while construction crews won't build them until the player chooses the tenants who will occupy them. For most of the rooms that are built, players must ensure they are supplied with various types of utilities, of which the game has five that can be supplied to the tower - power, water, gas, phones, and cable TV. Each utility requires a generator to be built in the underground floors - all have three different sizes, which vary in costs and the amount they can supply - and require cables/pipes to be connect rooms to the generators, with utility cabinets also needing to be built to connect rooms on different floors to the <b>utility</b> <b>network.</b> In addition to utilities, some rooms require a trash service to function properly; players must establish bins for both recyclable and non-recyclable on the floors were trash collection is required, and a waste retrieval service for each type in the underground floors.|$|E
