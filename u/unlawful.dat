5|$|It {{has been}} held in the UK that when a public {{authority}} exercises a statutory power {{for a number of}} purposes, some of which are <b>unlawful,</b> the applicable test for deciding whether the authority acted illegally is whether the <b>unlawful</b> purpose is incidental to the exercise of the power or if the dominant purpose is itself <b>unlawful.</b> If the primary or dominant purpose is the authorized purpose, the administrative action may be held valid.|$|E
5|$|Teo's counsel {{submitted}} {{that the}} nature and conditions of her detention rendered the detention <b>unlawful.</b> The Court of Appeal accepted that detention that was prima facie lawful can become <b>unlawful</b> if the nature or conditions of the detention fall below some minimum standard of treatment, but that extremely inhuman conditions must be shown to exist. In general, where {{the manner in which}} the detention is conducted is alleged to be <b>unlawful,</b> the detainee's remedy is to challenge the validity of the conditions of the detention, not the lawfulness of the detention itself.|$|E
5|$|A prohibiting order {{operates}} {{to prevent}} illegal action {{by a public}} authority from occurring in the first place. It may be granted by the High Court {{in cases where the}} applicant is aware that the authority is about to take an <b>unlawful</b> course of action, or to prevent the authority from repeating an <b>unlawful</b> act. Like a quashing order, a prohibiting order is used to help maintain good standards of public administration.|$|E

5|$|Modern sources citing Plummer and Bad Elk {{have tended}} {{to discuss the issue}} as defense against <b>unlawful</b> force; under {{contemporary}} law in most jurisdictions, a person may not use force to resist an <b>unlawful</b> arrest. The Plummer quote has been noted to be a fabrication, not appearing in the text of the opinion.|$|E
5|$|One {{possible}} {{interpretation of}} these provisions is that <b>unlawful</b> non-citizens {{should be kept}} in detention for as long as necessary to remove them, and that if removing them never became practicable, that they would be detained until death. In contrast, Al-Kateb argued that the provisions only allowed <b>unlawful</b> non-citizens to be detained while removal was a practical possibility, and that if removal was not a practical possibility, then they should be released from detention, at least while it remained impractical.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Unlawful</b> Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 curtailed online {{gambling}} in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{killing of}} another person must be <b>unlawful.</b> Some defences are {{therefore}} open to the defendant, among them self-defence. Carrying a lawful activity, for example, a fully qualified doctor carrying out an abortion in the required circumstances, could not result in an <b>unlawful</b> homicide even if the child was born alive. Consent might be relevant to some forms of homicide, but not to murder.|$|E
5|$|Under UK firearm law, CS {{and other}} incapacitant sprays are classed as {{prohibited}} weapons, making it <b>unlawful</b> for {{a member of}} the public to possess them.|$|E
5|$|Whether Teo's detention, even if {{originally}} lawful, {{had been}} rendered <b>unlawful</b> by {{the conditions of}} her detention.|$|E
5|$|A {{grand jury}} indicted Paul Schlesselman and Daniel Cowart on November 5, 2008, on federal charges of {{threatening}} {{to kill and}} inflict bodily harm upon a major presidential candidate, conspiracy, interstate <b>unlawful</b> transportation of an unregistered firearm, interstate transportation of a firearm {{with the intent to}} commit a felony, transporting a short-barreled shotgun across state lines without a license and <b>unlawful</b> possession of a short-barreled shotgun. Cowart was also charged with damaging religious property and use of a firearm during a crime of violence. On November 6, Schlesselman and Cowart pleaded not guilty before a federal magistrate in Memphis, Tennessee. The two were placed into federal custody without bail. The charges carry a maximum punishment of 50 years in prison and $540,000 in fines.|$|E
5|$|Any {{society that}} is not {{registered}} is deemed to be an <b>unlawful</b> society, and, as regards such a society, being involved in its management, {{being a member of}} it, and attending its meetings, are all offences.|$|E
5|$|Bad Elk v. United States, 177 U.S. 529 (1900), was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court held that an {{individual}} had the right to use force to resist an <b>unlawful</b> arrest and was entitled to a jury instruction to that effect.|$|E
5|$|In January 1997, the {{government}} of the Russian Federation, acting as the legal successor to the Soviet Union, exonerated Hartmann by admitting that his conviction for war crimes was <b>unlawful.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the {{legality}} of DFS has been determined on a state-by-state basis based on local gambling laws and other rulings. The federal <b>Unlawful</b> Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIEGA) contains language dictating that fantasy sports are not considered an <b>unlawful</b> wager under the act; however, the act only prohibits the electronic transfer of funds from <b>unlawful</b> gambling as defined under state laws. A number of state attorneys general have issued opinions concluding that DFS {{is a form of}} illegal gambling, while the state of Nevada declared that DFS games must be licensed as a sports pool. The New York State ruling, which resulted from an investigation of DFS services after it was alleged that employees working for DraftKings and FanDuel had used inside information to win cash prizes from each other, spawned retaliatory lawsuits from the companies which alleged that the rulings were the result of a misinterpretation of the nature of their services. The state has since joined other states, such as Massachusetts and Virginia, in choosing to legalize and regulate DFS rather than prohibit it.|$|E
5|$|Late 1980s and 1990s – Olympus makes {{substantial}} {{losses in}} financial trading, {{believed to be}} an attempt to mitigate poor trading results, due in part to Japan's weak currency. It conceals the losses using an <b>unlawful</b> but widespread practice known as a Tobashi scheme, or Tobashi.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{principle}} that is applied {{by the courts}} is that where statute grants a power to a decision-maker for purpose A, it is <b>unlawful</b> for the decision-maker to exercise the power for purpose B, because the decision-maker would be using the power for an unauthorized purpose.|$|E
5|$|The {{events in}} the Velepromet camp formed part of three {{different}} ICTY indictments, although none resulted in a conviction. In the trial of Slobodan Milošević, the charges brought against Milošević by the ICTY prosecutors included <b>unlawful</b> confinement, imprisonment, torture and inhumane acts against Croat and other non-Serb civilians, including one hundred detainees held in the Velepromet camp. Milošević died before his trial was completed. Vojislav Šešelj, {{the leader of the}} Serb Radical Party, associated with the White Eagles paramilitaries, was charged with the <b>unlawful</b> confinement and killing of at least six people at the Velepromet camp who were buried in a mass grave near the site of the Ovčara massacre, near the village of Grabovo south of Vukovar, as well as an unspecified {{number of people in the}} brick yard adjacent to the Velepromet camp. He was acquitted of all charges in 2016. Goran Hadžić, a Croatian Serb policial leader in eastern Slavonia, who held the office of President of SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia, was charged with the <b>unlawful</b> confinement and murder of the 17 people in Velepromet who were later buried within the compound. His trial was abandoned in 2014 as a result of Hadžić being diagnosed with terminal cancer.|$|E
5|$|The {{security}} perimeter even extended into {{the waters of}} Lake Ontario and included a Maritime Security Operation with numerous Police vessels and the Canadian Coast Guard Ship Griffon patrolling to discourage international demonstrators from <b>unlawful</b> entry into Canada.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{specific}} rules {{that apply to}} acts or omissions in homicide: an omission is criminal if the defendant fails to prevent the avoidable death of the victim {{where he or she}} has the duty to do so and that the defendant had the capacity to do so. As noted below, <b>unlawful</b> omissions have been excluded from <b>unlawful</b> act manslaughter. Like in other areas, a duty of care may now be owed, following R. v Evans, even where the dangerous situation which results in the victim's death was not caused by the defendant. Medical professionals may be relieved of their responsibility to sustain a patient's life, where terminating life support is dubiously legally classified as an omission.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} main forms of {{manslaughter}} in English law: voluntary manslaughter, cases which would otherwise amount to murder {{but for some}} legally recognised mitigating factor; and involuntary manslaughter which includes cases of gross negligence manslaughter and <b>unlawful</b> act manslaughter.|$|E
5|$|This {{case has}} been widely cited on the internet, but is no longer {{considered}} good law in {{a growing number of}} jurisdictions. Most states have, either by statute or by case law, removed the <b>unlawful</b> arrest defense for resisting arrest.|$|E
5|$|Arafat {{established}} a Palestinian police force, named the Preventive Security Service (PSS), that became active on 13 May. It was mainly composed of PLA soldiers and foreign Palestinian volunteers. Arafat assigned Mohammed Dahlan and Jibril Rajoub {{to head the}} PSS. Amnesty International accused Arafat and the PNA leadership for failing to adequately investigate abuses by the PSS (including torture and <b>unlawful</b> killings) of political opponents and dissidents {{as well as the}} arrests of human rights activists.|$|E
5|$|Carl Johnson sued Jefferson County for <b>unlawful</b> termination, {{after he}} was forced to resign from his {{position}} as Director of the Jefferson County Health Department. He alleged that his termination was due to concerns by the board members that his reports of contamination would lower property values. The suit was settled out of court for $150,000.|$|E
5|$|Enlisted sailors {{during this}} time {{included}} many foreign-born men, and native-born Americans were usually social outcasts who had few other employment options or {{they were trying to}} escape punishment for crimes. In 1835, almost 3,000men sailed with merchant ships out of Boston harbor, but only 90men were recruited by the Navy. It was <b>unlawful</b> for black men to serve in the Navy, but the shortage of men was so acute this law was frequently ignored.|$|E
5|$|Gambira faced a {{total of}} sixteen charges {{for his role in}} the protests, {{including}} membership in an <b>unlawful</b> association and illegal movement across borders. In October 2008, Gambira's lawyer, Aung Thein, resigned from his case, saying that the military government would not allow him the materials to prepare an adequate defence. On one occasion, Gambira refused to appear in court himself, stating that the trial of a forcibly disrobed monk was disrespectful to Buddhism.|$|E
5|$|Human rights {{organizations}} documented a wide number {{of human rights}} violations and abuses committed by Soviet and Azerbaijani forces. These included forced deportations of civilians, <b>unlawful</b> killings, torture, kidnapping harassment, rape and the wanton seizure or destruction of property. Despite fierce protests, no measures were taken either to prevent the human rights abuses or to punish the perpetrators. Approximately 17,000 Armenians living in twenty-three of Shahumyan's villages were deported out of the region.|$|E
5|$|Ian Tomlinson (7 February 1962– 1 April 2009) was a {{newspaper}} vendor who collapsed {{and died in}} the City of London after being struck by a police officer during the 2009 G-20 summit protests. After an inquest jury returned a verdict of <b>unlawful</b> killing, the officer, Simon Harwood, was prosecuted for manslaughter. He {{was found not guilty}} but was dismissed from the police service for gross misconduct.|$|E
5|$|Krikler {{comments}} that Mansfield's conclusions ignored the ruling precedent of his predecessor, Matthew Hale, that {{the killing of}} innocents {{in the name of}} self-preservation was <b>unlawful.</b> This ruling was to prove important a century later in R v Dudley and Stephens, which also concerned the justifiability of acts of murder at sea. Mansfield also failed to acknowledge another important legal principle—that no insurance claim can be legal if it arose from an illegal act.|$|E
5|$|Ladislaus II died on 14 January 1163. Stephen was crowned king {{thirteen}} days later. Mikó of Kalocsa {{once again}} performed the ceremony, because Lucas of Esztergom refused to crown him. Lucas even excommunicated Stephen, declaring his rule <b>unlawful.</b> According to the Gerhoh of Reichersberg, Stephen forbade the Hungarian prelates to send envoys to Pope Alexander III or to meet papal legates.|$|E
5|$|Lo Pui Sang v. Mamata Kapildev Dave (2008) took {{a narrow}} {{approach}} to the reading of personal liberty in Article 9(1). The High Court of Singapore held that personal liberty only refers to freedom from <b>unlawful</b> incarceration or detention, and does not include a liberty to contract. Although it was suggested this {{had always been the}} understanding of the term, no authority was cited.|$|E
5|$|On October 17, 2006, Bush {{signed into}} law the Military Commissions Act of 2006, a law enacted {{in the wake of}} the Supreme Court's {{decision}} in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, , which allows the U.S. government to prosecute <b>unlawful</b> enemy combatants by military commission rather than a standard trial. The law also denies them access to habeas corpus and bars the torture of detainees, but allows the president to determine what constitutes torture.|$|E
5|$|Shortly thereafter, the Military Commissions Act of 2006 {{may have}} raised again {{the issue of}} which court would hear cases such as Hamdan's. The U.S. Department of Justice has filed notice with several federal judges, and given notice to {{hundreds}} of detainees, that the habeas petitions of alien <b>unlawful</b> enemy combatants (or those whose status is to be determined) are not within the jurisdiction of those courts.|$|E
5|$|Some CDC {{researchers}} discover {{high levels}} of heavy water in creeks surrounding Wausau. As a precaution, they confiscate and slaughter all the local livestock. Edmund Holt, a local man paranoid about government overreach, organizes a group to resist what he believes are <b>unlawful</b> actions. At the same time, he oversees an underground tunnel that smuggles sick Christians who believe being baptized in the water will heal their ailments. Meanwhile, Em discovers she is pregnant.|$|E
5|$|The GAO {{found no}} {{evidence}} of improper or <b>unlawful</b> command influence by USAF leaders on the investigation or subsequent administrative and military justice actions. The GAO noted, however, that it was unable to obtain complete confirmation of this finding because the DoD denied the GAO request to interview key USAF officials including Santarelli, Dallager, Starr, and Mangin.|$|E
5|$|The aim of {{administrative}} law is {{to regulate the}} executive government by providing remedies which individuals can apply for when challenging administrative actions and decisions, and failures to take action and make decisions. Where the exercise of statutory or other discretionary power by public authorities contravenes the Constitution or is <b>unlawful</b> under administrative law, various remedies may be available when a judicial review action is taken.|$|E
