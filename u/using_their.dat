25|$|At {{once they}} invade the battleground {{and begin to}} wipe out the {{remainder}} of the Witch's forces. While some of the White Witch's army are trampled by the charging reinforcements, those that came with Aslan <b>use</b> <b>their</b> own ways of fighting: dwarves <b>use</b> <b>their</b> battle axes, dogs <b>use</b> <b>their</b> teeth, Rumblebuffin the giant uses his club (and steps on some of the enemy), centaurs <b>use</b> <b>their</b> swords, and unicorns <b>use</b> <b>their</b> horns. Then, Aslan kills the White Witch. When she is discovered dead, one-half of the surviving part of the White Witch's army surrenders and the other surviving half flees (they were later mentioned to have been exterminated sometime after the Pevensie Children's coronation).|$|R
5|$|The sand whiting's {{distinctive}} {{body shape}} and mouth placement is an adaptation to bottom feeding, {{which is the}} predominant method of feeding for all whiting species. All larger whiting feed by <b>using</b> <b>their</b> protrusile jaws and tube-like mouths to suck up various types of prey from in, on or above the ocean substrate, as well as <b>using</b> <b>their</b> nose as a 'plough' to dig through the substrate.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} solid, fast {{decaying}} sounds are produced using dampening techniques. The desired effect is produced after striking the knob, by leaving one’s hand or knee or the mallets themselves on it. When one player is using two gongs, the assistant holding the lower-pitched gong positions it {{at an angle}} and dampens its surface <b>using</b> <b>their</b> hands.|$|E
5|$|Actors {{and crew}} used their iPhones to {{communicate}} and store information such as the script—that way, they looked like guests casually <b>using</b> <b>their</b> phones. The phones were also used to record sound, in addition to digital recorders taped to each actor's body that were left running all day. For day scenes, Moore felt comfortable risking {{only three or four}} takes of each scene, but found he could do more at night.|$|E

5|$|Adult {{pelicans}} rely on visual {{displays and}} behaviour to communicate, particularly <b>using</b> <b>their</b> wings and bills. Agonistic behaviour consists of thrusting and snapping at opponents with their bills, or lifting and waving their wings in a threatening manner. Adult pelicans grunt when at the colony, but are generally silent elsewhere or outside breeding season. Conversely, colonies are noisy as chicks vocalise extensively.|$|E
5|$|After the rut, females form large {{herds of}} up to 50 individuals. Newborn calves are kept close {{by a series of}} vocalizations; larger {{nurseries}} have an ongoing and constant chatter during the daytime hours. When approached by predators, the largest and most robust females may make a stand, <b>using</b> <b>their</b> front legs to kick at their attackers. Guttural grunts and posturing effectively deter all but the most determined predators.|$|E

5|$|Although many non-sessile {{bivalves}} {{use their}} muscular foot to move around, or to dig, {{members of the}} freshwater family Sphaeriidae are exceptional in that these small clams climb about quite nimbly on weeds <b>using</b> <b>their</b> long and flexible foot. The European fingernail clam (Sphaerium corneum), for example, climbs around on water weeds {{at the edges of}} lakes and ponds; this enables the clam to find the best position for filter feeding.|$|E

30|$|One {{limitation}} {{of the present study}} is {{that it was impossible to}} assess whether the residents <b>used</b> <b>their</b> own prevalence beliefs to the right extent. Such an analysis would require assessing the residents’ beliefs about the likelihood of each disease producing the particular constellation of symptoms; these likelihoods are hard to quantify. Simpler cases in which the likelihood ratios can be quantified, such as making pre-post diagnostic judgments before vs. after a diagnostic test, suggest that medical professionals do not <b>use</b> <b>their</b> own pretest beliefs enough. Researchers in another study found that laypeople do not <b>use</b> <b>their</b> own base rate beliefs enough in a Bayesian updating task (Evans, Handley, Over, and Perham, 2002). Though we cannot specify, on the basis of the present study, whether the physicians <b>used</b> <b>their</b> prevalence beliefs as much as they ought to, the study demonstrates that they did <b>use</b> <b>their</b> own prevalence beliefs in a complicated task with many possible diagnoses.|$|R
