5|$|Early {{research}} {{showed that}} adding seductive details {{did not have}} the intended effect of improving learning; instead the seductive details tended to be detrimental to the learner's recall. Adding interesting but <b>unimportant</b> sentences to expository texts hindered the learning of the main points of the text and learners would remember the seductive details better than the main text.|$|E
5|$|Owing to the {{uncertainty}} surrounding the delivery {{and availability of}} the DB 601 engines, Heinkel switched to 820kW (1,100hp) Junkers Jumo 211 powerplants, whose somewhat greater size and weight were regarded as <b>unimportant</b> considerations in a twin-engine design. When the Jumo was fitted to the P model it became the He 111 H.|$|E
5|$|Putting on socks {{resembles a}} {{commutative}} operation since which sock {{is put on}} first is <b>unimportant.</b> Either way, the result (having both socks on), is the same. In contrast, putting on underwear and trousers is not commutative.|$|E
5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{composed}} {{dozens of}} art songs, arrangements of folk songs, chamber and piano music. While the piano music is relatively <b>unimportant,</b> {{many of the}} art songs possess a delicate beauty. While they yield in overt lyricism to Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff, otherwise they reserve {{their place in the}} standard repertory of Russian singers.|$|E
5|$|Smaller groups {{included}} the aithechthúatha (see Attacotti), Cálraighe, Cíarraige, Conmaicne, Dartraighe, Déisi, Éile, Fir Bolg, Fortuatha, Gailenga, Gamanraige, Mairtine, Múscraige, Partraige, Soghain, Uaithni, Uí Maine, Uí Liatháin. Many survived into late medieval times, others vanished as they became politically <b>unimportant.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{village of}} Mere {{was a small}} and <b>unimportant</b> {{settlement}} in the early 13th century. In 1243 Richard, the Earl of Cornwall, acquired the manor. Richard was the brother of Henry III and immensely rich. In 1253 he began to build a castle at Mere.|$|E
5|$|When Harding {{joined the}} U.S. Senate, the Democrats {{controlled}} {{both houses of}} Congress, and were led by President Wilson. As a junior senator in the minority, Harding received <b>unimportant</b> committee assignments, but carried out those duties assiduously. He was a safe, conservative, Republican vote. As during {{his time in the}} Ohio Senate, Harding came to be widely liked.|$|E
5|$|Exactly {{what part}} each {{played in the}} authorship is unknown. At the time, Grave {{asserted}} that he had authored the manifesto and that Kropotkin had revised it. Alternatively, Gregori Maximoff reported that Kropotkin had written the document and that Grave had merely advised minor alterations. George Woodcock noted that the work seems to be highly influenced by Kropotkin's common concerns and arguments against the German Empire, and so felt that the exact authorship was <b>unimportant.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gallium-67 salts such as gallium citrate and gallium nitrate {{are used}} as {{radiopharmaceutical}} agents in the nuclear medicine imaging known as gallium scan. The radioactive isotope 67Ga is used, and the compound or salt of gallium is <b>unimportant.</b> The body handles Ga3+ in many ways {{as though it were}} Fe3+, and the ion is bound (and concentrates) in areas of inflammation, such as infection, and in areas of rapid cell division. This allows such sites to be imaged by nuclear scan techniques.|$|E
5|$|On release, The Beatles {{received}} favourable {{reviews from}} the majority of music critics, but other commentators found its satirical songs <b>unimportant</b> and apolitical amid the turbulent political and social climate of 1968. The band and Martin have since debated whether the group should have released a single album instead. Nonetheless, The Beatles reached {{number one on the}} charts in both the United Kingdom and the United States and has since been viewed by some critics {{as one of the greatest}} albums of all time.|$|E
5|$|Once {{out in the}} world, the {{travelling}} {{group of}} rabbits finds itself following the leadership of Hazel, who, until now, has been just another <b>unimportant</b> member of the warren. The group travels far and through dangerous territory. Bigwig and Silver, both former Owsla and the strongest rabbits among them, do well to keep the others protected, along with Hazel's keen observations and good judgement.|$|E
5|$|Sociology {{of leisure}} {{is a fairly}} recent {{subfield}} of sociology, compared to more traditional subfields such as sociology of work, sociology of the family, and sociology of education: it saw most of its development {{in the second half}} of the 20th century. Until then, leisure had often been seen as a relatively <b>unimportant,</b> minor feature of society. Leisure is now recognized as a major social institution, deserving of serious sociological inquiry, particularly in Western societies.|$|E
5|$|The French {{primarily}} {{viewed the}} colony as an <b>unimportant</b> source of untrained labour and raw cotton; France introduced large-scale cotton production in 1929. The colonial administration in Chad was critically understaffed {{and had to}} rely on the dregs of the French civil service. Only the Sara of the south was governed effectively; French presence in the Islamic north and east was nominal. The educational system was affected by this neglect.|$|E
5|$|The letter {{reveals that}} Gray {{felt that the}} poem was <b>unimportant,</b> {{and that he did}} not expect it to become as popular or {{influential}} as it did. Gray dismisses its positives as merely being {{that he was able to}} complete the poem, which was probably influenced by his experience of the churchyard at Stoke Poges, where he attended the Sunday service and was able to visit the grave of Antrobus.|$|E
5|$|The {{presiding}} consul began each {{meeting with}} a speech on an issue, and then referred the issue to the senators, who discussed the matter by order of seniority. <b>Unimportant</b> matters could be voted on by a voice vote or by a show of hands, while important votes resulted in a physical division of the house, with senators voting by taking a place {{on either side of}} the chamber. Any vote was always between a proposal and its negative.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes {{normally}} rotate cyclonically (when {{viewed from}} above, this is counterclockwise {{in the northern}} hemisphere and clockwise in the southern). While large-scale storms always rotate cyclonically due to the Coriolis effect, thunderstorms and tornadoes are so small that the direct influence of the Coriolis effect is <b>unimportant,</b> as indicated by their large Rossby numbers. Supercells and tornadoes rotate cyclonically in numerical simulations even when the Coriolis effect is neglected. Low-level mesocyclones and tornadoes owe their rotation to complex processes within the supercell and ambient environment.|$|E
5|$|After {{the liberation}} of most of Australian New Guinea the RAAF and RAN participated in the US-led Western New Guinea campaign, which had the goal of {{securing}} bases {{to be used to}} mount {{the liberation of}} the Philippines. Australian warships and the fighter, bomber and airfield construction squadrons of No.10Operational Group RAAF participated in the capture of Hollandia, Biak, Noemfoor and Morotai. After western New Guinea was secured No.10Operation Group was renamed the First Tactical Air Force (1TAF) and was used to protect the flank of the Allied advance by attacking Japanese positions in the NEI and performing other garrison tasks. The losses incurred whilst performing these relatively <b>unimportant</b> roles led to a decline in morale, and contributed to the 'Morotai Mutiny' in April 1945.|$|E
5|$|After the {{surrender}} of General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, {{the primary reason for}} manned defenses protecting Washington ceased to exist. Initial recommendations by Colonel Barton S. Alexander, then-chief engineer of the Washington defenses, were to divide the defenses into three classes: those that should be kept active (first-class), those that should be mothballed and kept in a reserve state (second-class), and those that should be abandoned entirely (third-class). Due to its rear-area nature {{and the fact that the}} fort was <b>unimportant</b> to the overall defenses of Washington, Fort Runyon fell into the third-class category.|$|E
5|$|Australia's {{role in the}} Pacific War {{declined}} from 1944. The increasing size of the US forces in the Pacific rendered the Australian military superfluous and labour shortages forced the Government {{to reduce the size}} of the armed forces to boost war production. Nevertheless, the Government wanted the Australian military to remain active, and agreed to MacArthur's proposals that it be used in relatively <b>unimportant</b> campaigns. In late 1944, Australian troops and RAAF squadrons replaced US garrisons in eastern New Guinea, New Britain, and Bougainville, and launched offensives aimed at destroying or containing the remaining Japanese forces there. In May 1945, I Corps, the Australian First Tactical Air Force and USAAF and USN units began the Borneo Campaign, which continued until the end of the war. These campaigns contributed little to Japan's defeat and remain controversial.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{was killed}} in a November 1963 coup, {{allowing}} Thi to return to South Vietnam and resume his military service. Soon after arriving home, Thi found himself involved in another coup plot, acting as the link between Khánh and Đỗ Mậu, two generals disgruntled with their position under the military junta of Minh, who oversaw the overthrow of Diệm. Mau was one of the principal tacticians in the 1963 coup; although he did not command troops, he had a thorough knowledge of the backgrounds of the ARVN officers and their strengths, weaknesses and characteristics through his role as Diệm's director of military security, and this understanding had allowed him to engineer the previous coup. Minh's junta feared Mau's shrewdness and tried to sideline him by making him the Minister of Information, a relatively <b>unimportant</b> position.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{his years}} in the Philippines, Taft was keenly {{interested}} as president in East Asian affairs. Taft considered relations with Europe relatively <b>unimportant,</b> {{but because of the}} potential for trade and investment, Taft ranked the post of minister to China as most important in the Foreign Service. Knox did not agree, and declined a suggestion that he go to Peking to view the facts on the ground. Taft considered Roosevelt's minister there, William W. Rockhill, as uninterested in the China trade, and replaced him with William J. Calhoun, whom McKinley and Roosevelt had sent on several foreign missions. Knox did not listen to Calhoun on policy, and there were often conflicts. Taft and Knox tried unsuccessfully to extend John Hay's Open Door Policy to Manchuria.|$|E
5|$|French-speaking naturalists {{in several}} {{countries}} showed appreciation of the much modified French translation by Clémence Royer, but Darwin's ideas had little impact in France, where any scientists supporting evolutionary ideas opted for a form of Lamarckism. The intelligentsia in Russia had accepted the general phenomenon of evolution for several years before Darwin had published his theory, and scientists were quick to take it into account, although the Malthusian aspects were felt to be relatively <b>unimportant.</b> The political economy of struggle was criticised as a British stereotype by Karl Marx and by Leo Tolstoy, who had the character Levin in his novel Anna Karenina voice sharp criticism of the morality of Darwin's views.|$|E
5|$|Homosexual arousal in {{childhood}} appeared to predict adult homosexuality, while homosexual activities and arousal during adolescence {{had a very}} strong connection with adult homosexuality. Rape and sexual molestation {{did not appear to be}} significant in the development of homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood had a very small effect on adult sexual preference. Homosexual women were more likely to have their first homosexual encounter before their first heterosexual encounter. Phenomena associated with physical maturation, such as the age at which menstruation began, did not appear to play a significant role in the development of sexual preference, while parental attitudes toward sex and failure to enjoy early heterosexual activity also seemed <b>unimportant.</b> Sexual feelings seemed important in the development of adult homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|It {{is often}} {{held that the}} Renown and Courageous classes were {{designed}} for Fisher's plan to land troops (possibly Russian) on the German Baltic coast. Specifically, they were designed with a reduced draught, which might be important in the shallow Baltic. This is not clear-cut evidence that the ships were designed for the Baltic: it was considered that earlier ships had too much draught and not enough freeboard under operational conditions. Roberts argues that {{the focus on the}} Baltic was probably <b>unimportant</b> at the time the ships were designed, but was inflated later, after the disastrous Dardanelles Campaign.|$|E
5|$|Italian armies easily outnumbered {{those of}} the British, who were {{defending}} multiple areas in North Africa with skeleton forces. With Cyrenaica and the Sudan under threat as well as Somaliland, only token units were available to control what was considered a relatively <b>unimportant</b> possession. In fact, until December 1939 British policy had been to abandon Somaliland altogether {{in the face of}} invasion. However, General Archibald Wavell, the newly appointed commander of British armies in Africa, successfully recommended to the British Chiefs of Staff that Somaliland be defended. A multiracial congregation of five battalions, the minimum force that was adjudged capable of defending the region, was assembled by the beginning of August.|$|E
5|$|The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism was Weber's {{third major}} {{work on the}} {{sociology}} of religion. In this work he deals with the structure of Indian society, with the orthodox doctrines of Hinduism and the heterodox doctrines of Buddhism, with modifications brought by the influence of popular religiosity and finally {{with the impact of}} religious beliefs on the secular ethic of Indian society. In Weber's view, Hinduism in India, like Confucianism in China, was a barrier for capitalism. The Indian caste system made it very difficult for individuals to advance in the society beyond their caste. Activity, including economic activity, was seen as <b>unimportant</b> {{in the context of the}} advancement of the soul.|$|E
5|$|The {{desperation and}} the violent {{reaction}} {{of a generation}} robbed of a safe future are well-represented by the British punk movement of 1977–1978, whose rebellion against the establishment continued diluted in the new wave and post-punk music of the 1980s. These self-proclaimed punks were politically militant, relishing their anarchic attitude and stage practices like pogo dancing. They wore short and spiked hairstyles or shaved heads, often with safety pins and ripped clothes, and considered musical prowess <b>unimportant</b> {{as long as the}} music was simple and loud. However, not all working-class male youths embraced the punk movement; some preferred to escape from their grim reality in heavy metal, which was equally effective in providing fun, stress relief, and peer companionship– otherwise denied because of their unemployment.|$|E
5|$|The points {{system in}} the 1905 Tour de France had been {{successful}} enough in reducing cheating, so the Tour organisers used it again in the 1906 Tour de France, with a few changes: whereas in 1905, time differences still had some effect on the points distribution, in 1906 time differences were <b>unimportant,</b> and points were only given for {{the order in which}} the cyclists finished. The winner of the stage received one point, the second rider two points, et cetera. After the eighth stage, only 16 cyclists were remaining, and the results from the first eight stages were recalculated, with only the remaining cyclists, and the points were redistributed among the remaining riders in accordance with their positions in those stages.|$|E
5|$|Until the 20th century, naval weapons {{had a short}} range, so {{camouflage}} was <b>unimportant</b> for ships, and for the men {{on board}} them. Paint schemes were {{selected on the basis}} of ease of maintenance or aesthetics, typically buff upperworks (with polished brass fittings) and white or black hulls. Around the start of the 20th century, the increasing range of naval engagements, as demonstrated by the Battle of Tsushima, prompted the introduction of the first camouflage, in the form of some solid shade of gray overall, in the hope that ships would fade into the mist.|$|E
5|$|When Geta died in 211, her {{responsibilities}} increased because Caracalla found {{administrative tasks}} to be mundane. She {{may have taken}} upon {{one of the more}} important civil functions of the emperor; receiving petitions and answering correspondence. The extent of her role in this position, however, is probably overstated. She may have represented her son and played a role in meetings and answering queries; however, the final authority on legal matters was Caracalla. When Caracalla was murdered, Julia was in Antioch sorting out correspondence, removing <b>unimportant</b> messages from the bunch so that when Caracalla returned, he would not be overburdened with duties. The emperor filled all of the roles in the legal system as judge, legislator, and administrator.|$|E
5|$|A {{new wave}} of reforms {{supported}} by progressive magnates such as the Czartoryski family and King Stanisław August were introduced at the Partition Sejm. The most important included the 1773 establishment of the Commission of National Education (Komisja Edukacji Narodowej)the first ministry {{of education in the}} world. New schools were opened, uniform textbooks were printed, teachers received better education and poor students were provided with scholarships. The Commonwealth's military was to be modernized and funding to create a larger standing army was agreed. Economic and commercial reformsincluding some intended to cover the increased military budget previously shunned as <b>unimportant</b> by the szlachtawere introduced. A new executive assembly, the 36-strong Permanent Council comprising five ministries with limited legislative powers, was established, giving the Commonwealth a governing body in constant session between Sejms and therefore immune to their liberum veto disruptions.|$|E
5|$|During the Han dynasty under Han Wudi (141–87 BCE), the Chinese {{government}} {{united and}} became powerful enough that China began to successfully indulge in imperialistic endeavors with its neighboring nations in East Asia. Han China's imperialism was a peaceful tributary system, which focused mainly on diplomatic and trade relations. The {{growth of the}} Han Empire facilitated trade and cultural exchange with {{virtually all of the}} known world as reached from Asia, and Chinese silks spread through Asia and Inner Asia and even to Rome. The early T'ang dynasty saw China as even more responsive to foreign influence and the T'ang dynasty becoming a great empire. Overseas trade with India and the Middle East grew rapidly, and China's East and Southern Coasts, once distant and <b>unimportant</b> regions, gradually became chief areas of foreign trade. During the Song Dynasty China's navy became more powerful thanks to technological improvements in shipbuilding and navigation, and China's maritime commerce also increased exponentially.|$|E
5|$|During {{the run of}} Iolanthe, in 1883, Sullivan was knighted by Queen Victoria. Although it was the operas with Gilbert {{that had}} earned him the {{broadest}} fame, the honour was conferred for his services to serious music. The musical establishment, and many critics, believed that this should {{put an end to}} his career as a composer of comic opera—that a musical knight should not stoop below oratorio or grand opera. Sullivan, despite the financial security of writing for the Savoy, increasingly viewed his work with Gilbert as <b>unimportant,</b> beneath his skills, and repetitious. Furthermore, he was unhappy that he had to simplify his music to ensure that Gilbert's words could be heard. But paradoxically, in February 1883, just after Iolanthe opened, Sullivan had signed a five-year agreement with Gilbert and Carte requiring him to produce a new comic opera on six months' notice.|$|E
5|$|Ernest {{resumed his}} duties in early November, by now {{promoted}} to major-general. He hoped his new rank {{would bring him}} a corps or brigade command, but none was forthcoming as the Allied armies retreated slowly through the Netherlands towards Germany. By February 1795, they had reached Hanover. Ernest remained in Hanover over the next year, holding several <b>unimportant</b> postings. He had requested a return home to seek treatment for his eye, {{but it was not}} until early 1796 that the King agreed and allowed Ernest to return to Britain. There, Prince Ernest consulted a notable eye doctor, Wathen Waller, but Waller apparently found his condition inoperable, as no operation took place. Once back in Britain, Ernest repeatedly sought to be allowed to join the British forces on the Continent, even threatening to join the Yeomanry as a private, but both the King and the Duke of York refused. Ernest did not want to rejoin the Hanoverian forces, as they were not then involved in the fighting. In addition, Freytag was seriously ill, and Ernest was unwilling to serve under his likely successor, Count von Wallmoden.|$|E
5|$|General Douglas MacArthur, the {{commander}} of Allied forces in the SWPA, decided on 6June to postpone the Selaru operation until after Allied forces landed in the Philippines. This was not communicated to No.80 Wing, however, and Caldwell continued to develop plans for its involvement in the Selaru operation until late August. The effective cancellation of the operation left No.80 Wing without a clear mission, and its pilots were left {{with nothing to do}} other than train. In September Air Commodore Alan Charlesworth, {{the commander}} of North-Western Area, reported to Bostock that the wing's morale could drop if it was not either given an active role or transferred to southern Australia. During the same period No.80 Wing's pilots observed that No.1 Wing's Spitfires were making occasional strafing attacks on Japanese positions in the NEI and sought approval to conduct similar operations. Caldwell did not agree to this, however, as be believed that the risks associated with flying Spitfires to the edge of their range to attack <b>unimportant</b> targets outweighed any benefits to morale.|$|E
5|$|His {{expertise}} {{resulted in}} his being invited by Charles Close, the Director-General of the Ordnance Survey (OS), to join that organisation as their first archaeological officer. Accepting the position, Crawford moved to Southampton and began {{work at the}} project in October 1920. His arrival at the OS generated some resentment, with co-workers often seeing his post as superfluous and deeming archaeology to be <b>unimportant.</b> His job entailed correcting and updating information about archaeological monuments as the OS maps were revised, and involved him undertaking much fieldwork, travelling across the British landscape to check the location of previously recorded sites and discover new ones. He began in Gloucestershire in late 1920, visiting 208 sites around the Cotswolds and adding 81 previously unknown barrows to the map. Based on his research in this region, in 1925 he published his book Long Barrows and the Stone Circles of the Cotswolds and the Welsh Marches.|$|E
