25|$|The Poles' {{resistance}} in Warsaw is a Jewish resistance. Only yids {{are capable of}} the blackmail of putting {{women and children in}} the front line, {{to take advantage of the}} Germans' sense of scruple. The Germans have no interest in the destruction of Romania. Only a pro-German government can save <b>us...</b> <b>What</b> <b>is</b> happening on the frontier with Bukovina is a scandal, because new waves of Jews are flooding into the country. Rather than a Romania again invaded by kikes, it would be better to have a German protectorate.|$|E
25|$|Imperatives {{are either}} {{hypothetical}} or categorical. Hypothetical imperatives provide the rules an agent must follow when she adopts a contingent end (an end based on desire or inclination). So, for example, if I want ice cream, I {{should go to}} the ice cream shop or make myself some ice cream. But notice that this imperative only applies if I want ice cream. If I have no interest in ice cream, the imperative does not apply to me. Kant thinks that {{there are two types of}} hypothetical imperative—rules of skill and counsels of prudence. Rules of skill are determined by the particular ends we set and tell <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> necessary to achieve those particular ends. However, Kant observes that there is one end that we all share, namely our own happiness. Unfortunately, it is difficult, if not impossible, to know what will make us happy or how to achieve the things that will make us happy. Therefore, Kant argues, we can at best have counsels of prudence, as opposed to outright rules.|$|E
25|$|One might further {{hypothesize that}} the {{experimental}} treatment regulates cholesterol, because the treatment seems to selectively regulate genes associated with cholesterol. While {{this may be}} true, {{there are a number}} of reasons why making this a firm conclusion based on enrichment alone represents an unwarranted leap of faith. One previously mentioned issue has to do with the observation that gene regulation may have no direct impact on protein regulation: even if the proteins coded for by these genes do nothing other than make cholesterol, showing that their mRNA is altered does not directly tell <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> happening at the protein level. It is quite possible that the amount of these cholesterol-related proteins remains constant under the experimental conditions. Second, even if protein levels do change, perhaps there is always enough of them around to make cholesterol as fast as it can be possibly made, that is, another protein, not on our list, is the rate determining step in the process of making cholesterol. Finally, proteins typically play many roles, so these genes may be regulated not because of their shared association with making cholesterol but because of a shared role in a completely independent process.|$|E

Producers told me, 'Boy, you really stuck it to the {{networks}}.' The networks told me, 'Boy, you really hammered the studios.' Nobody got to the point.

500|$|On {{the matter}} of {{historical}} accuracy, Christopher Caldwell wrote in the Financial Times: [...] "Of course, we must not mistake a feature film for a public television documentary", {{pointing out that the}} film should be treated as entertainment, not as a historical account of the time period it is set in. [...] "Django uses slavery the way a pornographic film might use a nurses' convention: as a pretext for what is really meant to entertain <b>us.</b> <b>What</b> <b>is</b> really meant to entertain us in Django is violence." [...] Richard Brody, however, wrote in The New Yorker that Tarantino's [...] "vision of slavery's monstrosity is historically accurate.... Tarantino rightly depicts slavery as no mere administrative ownership but a grievous and monstrous infliction of cruelty." ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen Colbert, portraying his {{character}} Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, chose the word truthiness just moments before taping the premiere episode of The Colbert Report on October 17, 2005, after deciding that the originally scripted word – [...] "truth" [...] – was not absolutely ridiculous enough: [...] "We're {{not talking about}} truth, we're {{talking about something that}} seems like truth – the truth we want to exist", he explained. He introduced his definition in the first segment of the episode, saying: [...] "Now I'm sure some of the 'word police', the 'wordinistas' over at Webster's are gonna say, 'Hey, that's not a word'. Well, anybody who knows me knows I'm no fan of dictionaries or reference books. They're elitist. Constantly telling <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> or isn't true. Or what did or didn't happen." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bäckman {{claims that}} {{children}} that are {{being taken care of}} by Finnish child protection authorities are living in [...] "concentration camps", and explains that [...] "this is a certain system of political terror". [...] To explain why {{the rest of the world}} has not noticed this, he claims that [...] "Children who get into these camps have special prohibitions for communications, they cannot tell <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> happening there." [...] He states that [...] "I think that the juvenile justice system, the system of a mass removal of children, is genocide of children.".
