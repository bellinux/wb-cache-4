40|$|In {{interference}} coupled wireless systems, {{where it}} is not possible to "orthogonalize" all the users in the system, we characterize the impact of interference coupling on the convexity of certain utility functions and problems. We introduce a general class of competitive <b>user</b> <b>utility</b> functions and natural competitive <b>user</b> <b>utility</b> functions. We further introduce the signal-to-interference based utility functions, which are based on physical layer parameters in wireless systems. We prove the conditions, which when satisfied result in a competitive <b>user</b> <b>utility</b> function being a signal-to-interference ratio based utility function. We further show that there exists no natural competitive <b>user</b> <b>utility</b> function, which is convex or concave. Furthermore, we show that a sum of weighted combination of natural competitive <b>user</b> <b>utility</b> functions is not convex or concave. Such functions are commonly encountered in wireless communication systems, e. g. rate or MMSE as a function of signal-to-interference ratio. We show that such rate maximization or MMSE minimization problems are not convex programs under our specified conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of real-world probabilistic systems {{are used by}} more than one <b>user,</b> thus a <b>utility</b> model must be elicited separately for each new <b>user.</b> <b>Utility</b> elicitation is long and tedious, particularly if the outcome space is large and not decomposable. Most research on utility elicitation focuses on making assumptions about the decomposability of the utility function. Here we make no assumptions about the decomposability of the utility function; rather we attempt to cluster a database of existing <b>user</b> <b>utility</b> functions into a small number of prototypical utility functions. Having identified these prototypes, we can then effectively classify a new <b>user's</b> <b>utility</b> function by asking many fewer and simpler assessments than full utility model elicitation would require...|$|R

40|$|Static {{optimization}} {{of networks}} by pricing has attracted significant attention {{over the last}} decade. These studies assumed concave utility functions for users and derived optimal pricing strategies for the network provider. In this paper, we consider effect of user's elasticity to price and bandwidth on optimality of pricing. We first derive optimal pricing strategy for the case of logarithmic <b>user</b> <b>utilities.</b> Then, we investigate two types of elasticity for users: Demandprice elasticity and utility-bandwidth elasticity. By incorporating these two elasticities, we develop a non-logarithmic utility function for users. Finally, we derive an optimal pricing strategy for the non-logarithmic <b>user</b> <b>utilities</b> and illustrate that pricing strategy should be more conservative when the elasticities increase...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel model of {{resource}} sharing schemes that provide each user with a fixed minimum and a random extra amount of bandwidth and buffer. Allocations and prices are adjusted {{to adapt to}} resource availability and user demands. At equilibrium, if it exists, all users optimize their utility and resource demand equals supply, i. e., the marginal increase in user utility due to higher return on variable resources is balanced by the marginal decrease in utility due to their variability. We show how an equilibrium might be approached using a simple price adjustment rule that does not require any knowledge {{on the part of}} the network about <b>user</b> <b>utilities.</b> We further show that at equilibrium every user holds strictly positive amounts of variable bandwidth and variable buffer, and in the same ratio.

40|$|We {{study the}} flow control and routing {{decisions}} of self-interested users {{in a general}} congested network where a single profit-maximizing service provider sets prices for different paths in the network. We define an equilibrium of the user choices. We then define the monopoly equilibrium (ME) as the equilibrium prices set by the service provider and the corresponding user equilibrium. We analyze the networks containing different types of user utilities: elastic or inelastic. For a network containing inelastic <b>user</b> <b>utilities,</b> we show the flow allocations at the ME and the social optimum are the same. For a network containing elastic <b>user</b> <b>utilities,</b> we explicitly characterize the ME and study its performance relative to the user equilibrium at 0 prices and the social optimum that would result from centrally maximizing the aggregate system utility. We also define Braess’ Paradox for a network involving pricing and show that Braess’ Paradox does not occur under monopoly prices...|$|E
40|$|Many {{practical}} {{wireless communications}} systems select their transmit rate from a finite set of modulation and coding schemes, which correspond {{to a set}} of discrete rates. In this paper, we therefore formulate a joint coordinated precoding and discrete rate selection problem for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multicell networks. Compared to the common assumption of using the continuous Shannon rates as the <b>user</b> <b>utilities,</b> explicitly accounting for the discrete rates more accurately models practical wireless communication systems. The optimization problem that we formulate is combinatorial and non-convex, however, and is thus hard to solve. We therefore rewrite the problem using a discontinuous rate function, which we then bound using its concave envelope in some domain. Based on block coordinate descent, we provide a convergent resource allocation algorithm which can be implemented in a semi-distributed fashion. Numerical performance evaluation shows performance gains when the discrete rates are optimized using our model, as compared to the traditional methods which use the continuous Shannon rates as the <b>user</b> <b>utilities.</b> Comment: Submitted to IEEE Signal Processing Letter...|$|E

40|$|Emerging information-centric {{networking}} architectures seek to optimally utilize both bandwidth {{and storage}} for efficient content distribution. This highlights {{the need for}} joint design of traffic engineering and caching strategies, in order to optimize network performance in view of both current traffic loads and future traffic demands. We present a systematic framework for joint dynamic interest request forwarding and dynamic cache placement and eviction, {{within the context of}} the Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture. The framework employs a virtual control plane which operates on the user demand rate for data objects in the network, and an actual plane which handles Interest Packets and Data Packets. We develop distributed algorithms within the virtual plane to achieve network load balancing through dynamic forwarding and caching, thereby maximizing the user demand rate that the NDN network can satisfy. Next, we show that congestion control can be optimally combined with forwarding and caching within this framework to maximize <b>user</b> <b>utilities</b> subject to network stability. Numerical experiments within a number of network settings demonstrate the superior performance of the resulting algorithms for the actual plane in terms of high <b>user</b> <b>utilities,</b> low user delay, and high rate of cache hits.

40|$|Abstract—A {{variety of}} {{emerging}} online data delivery applications challenge existing techniques for data delivery to human users, applications, or middleware that are accessing data from multiple autonomous servers. In this paper, we develop {{a framework for}} formalizing and comparing pull-based solutions and present dual optimization approaches. The first approach, most commonly used Nowadays, maximizes <b>user</b> <b>utility</b> under the strict setting of meeting a priori constraints on the usage of system resources. We present alternative and more flexible approach that maximizes <b>user</b> <b>utility</b> by satisfying all users. It does this while minimizing the usage of system resources. We discuss the benefits of this latter approach and develop an adaptive monitoring solution Satisfy User Profiles (SUPs). Through formal analysis, we identify sufficient optimality conditions for SUP. Using real(RSS feeds) and synthetic traces, we empirically analyze the behavior of SUP under varying conditions. Our experiments show that we can achieve {{a high degree of}} satisfaction of <b>user</b> <b>utility</b> when the estimations of SUP closely estimate the real event stream, and has the potential to save a significant amount of system resources. We further show that SUP can exploit feedback to improve <b>user</b> <b>utility</b> with only a moderate increase in resource utilization.

For service providers, it is one of their main targets to find the optimal QoS strategy based on user preferences.
