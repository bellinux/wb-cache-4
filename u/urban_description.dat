The final fifth part tries to answer the question, how a modern temple should look like...|$|E
40|$|The spatial {{patterns}} and processes of cities {{can be described}} with various entropy functions. However, spatial entropy always depends {{on the scale of}} measurement, {{and it is difficult to}} find a characteristic value for it. In contrast, fractal parameters can be employed to characterize scale-free phenomena and reflect the local features of random multi-scaling structure. This paper is devoted to exploring the similarities and differences between spatial entropy and fractal dimension in <b>urban</b> <b>description.</b> Drawing an analogy between cities and growing fractals, we illustrate the definitions of fractal dimension based on different entropy concepts. Three representative fractal dimensions in the multifractal dimension set, capacity dimension, information dimension, and correlation dimension, are utilized to make empirical analyses of the urban form of two Chinese cities, Beijing and Hangzhou. The results show that the entropy values vary with the measurement scale, but the fractal dimension value is stable is method and study area are fixed; if the linear size of boxes is small enough (e. g., < 1 / 25), the linear correlation between entropy and fractal dimension is significant (based on the confidence level of 99 %). Further empirical analysis indicates that fractal dimension is close to the characteristic values of spatial entropy. This suggests that the physical meaning of fractal dimension can be interpreted by the ideas from entropy and scaling and the conclusion is revealing for future spatial analysis of cities...|$|E
40|$|Cairo: {{the urban}} legend, {{is one of}} the most ancient, colourful, {{multifaceted}} of cities. Seat of pharaohs, sultans and kings, prize of conquerors from Alexander to Saladin to Napoleon, "the city Victorious" has never stopped reinventing herself. The very nature of Cairo has ever reflected polycentric ensembles of urbanism that belonged to different user group, with different perspectives, conceptions and aspirations towards their city life. Sorrowfully over the past few decades, the city has lost most of its acquired identities for reasons beyond the scope of this paper. It is argued that the city has undergone, and still undergoing- a process of expansion and extension for its physical measures on the expenses of its societal, heritage and cultural identity to the extent that is considered as “a city out of control”. Where is Cairo going? Who defines its directions? Whose visions does it follow? Is planning still possible for contemporary Cairo? Can the quality of life be improved by improving the city’s resilience? With Egyptian history instantly being rewritten, I am dreaming of a Cairo reborn. Hence, imaging the future of Cairo for any planning, design or governance intention requires understanding and inferring the functional aspects of the socio-cultural patterns in the city. Hence determining the what, why and how of planning and design. This further requires reviewing theoretical conceptualisations and evaluating examples of other cities and regions that are agreed upon as vibrant, resilient, liveable, smart and most importantly: happy. The paper at hand serves as a theoretical approach towards understanding contemporary Cairo identity as a prologue for its urban reform as a vibrant city. My objective is to introduce a model for understanding Cairo through correlating urbanism to its political, economic, legislative, and socio-cultural attributes. Therefor hypothesise visions for its transformation into a vibrant city. The methodology is based on a quick review of the modern urban history of Cairo; identifying its districts types, their local characteristics of user groups, behavioural patterns and physical settings, and then discussing Cairo’s overall contemporary political, economic, legislative, and socio-cultural attributes that altogether designate its overall cultural identity. Based on the works of Stewart-Hakky-Hemdan, Abu-Loghod, Giraud, Raymond, Sims, Singerman, Amar et al, further talk about Cairo argues its actuality as a collective/integrated capital, or interrelated/intertwined entities of substantial districts. Thus identifying its urbanism lacks and shortcomings. Based on the works of Jacobs, Alexander, Lynch, Gosling, Maitland, Wiedenhoeft, Geddes, Low, Patsy, Montgomery and others, theoretical debates then discern contextual definitions and conflicts of “vibrant”, “resilient”, “smart”, “liveable”, “sustainable”and “happy”city concepts. Through an exploratory grounded observation in the various, multi-faceted districts of the city, in addition to a random exploratory investigation with a number of residents, an attempt was to give Cairo an <b>urban</b> <b>description</b> was undergone. Questions are thenceforth evoked about the values, visions and practices explores the possibilities and suitability of approaches that profile a theory towards the transformation of our Cairo Victorious into a liveable, sustainable, smart, and a happy city. Such discussion is also expected to provide insights for planners, designers, decision makers for the betterment of both practice and education fields...|$|E

40|$|Shopping as Liberation?: Women and Urban Space in Amsterdam, 1863 - 1913 In {{recent decades}} several historians {{have argued that}} the {{emergence}} of shopping as a leisure activity {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century substantially enhanced women’s freedom of movement in public spaces and promoted female emancipation in general. Based on <b>urban</b> <b>descriptions</b> and digitised newspaper articles on nineteenth-century Amsterdam – on its main shopping street, the Kalverstraat, in particular – this article takes a more nuanced stance. Shopping as a leisure activity was older in origin than is often assumed and to some extent was a male activity as well. While shopping, ladies encountered numerous factors that hampered their spatial mobility, from road debris, pawing, mugging, the presence of prostitutes to ‘moral harassment’ over exploited shop girls. Indeed, a single feminist framed the right to shop and to visit restaurants in an explicit discourse of ‘liberation’. However, to argue that shopping promoted female emancipation in general would suggest a too linear and monolithic approach...|$|R

Starting from an initial seed intersection, which gives the size and orientation of the expected grid, this system uses a feature-based hypothesis and verify paradigm to extract a 3 -D description of the street grid.

40|$|The major {{emission}} source of primary PM 2. 5 in many Nordic countries is wood burning for domestic heating. Though direct measurements of wood burning emissions are possible under controlled conditions, emission inventories for urban scale domestic heating {{are difficult to}} calculate and remain uncertain. As an alternative method for estimating these emissions this paper makes use of ambient air measurements, chemical analysis of filter samples, receptor models, dispersion models, and simple inverse modelling methods to infer emission strengths. A comparison of dispersion models with receptor models indicates that the dispersion models tend to overestimate the contribution from wood burning. The inverse modelling results are found to agree with those from the receptor modelling. Though both the receptor and inverse modelling point to an overestimation of the wood burning emissions of PM 2. 5 {{it is not possible}} to assign this solely to errors in the emissions inventory as dispersion model error can be significant. It is recommended to improve plume rise and <b>urban</b> canopy meteorological <b>descriptions</b> in the dispersion models before these models will be of sufficient quality to allow quantitative assessments of emission inventories.

40|$|Abstract Climate shifts, {{environmental}} degrada-tion, aging infrastructure, energy {{adaptation and}} population growth are impacting many cities world-wide and will force changes to the way water is managed {{in the future for}} most cities around the world. To help meet these challenges, the SWITCH European Framework VI project is developing deci-sion support tools to assist city stakeholder commu-nities to scope future options for integrated urban water management (IUWM). City Water Balance (CWB) is one of several simulation tools being developed within SWITCH as part of the City Water integrated knowledge base system/decision support system. CWB is a scoping tool developed to allow the rapid assessment of alternative water management strategies for a city. The tool outputs indicator data on water demand, quality, energy consumption, and simplified life-cycle cost. The data requirements of City Water Balance allow a model to be established quickly from extant spatial mapping.

The <b>description</b> will focus on the principal 2 ̆ 7 s activities in implementing the plan, obstacles encountered along the way, and measure taken to minimize them. ^ Field study procedures are used in this study in order to provide tangible ways to describe efforts of change. Participant observation, conferences, interviews and journals are the means by which the field study is accomplished. An aim of these procedures is to permit observation of the performance and reactions of the teachers and the students as unobtrusively as possible during the time the innovation was carried out. ^ In this study, the principal functioned as a participant observer who recorded what was happening. Since interviews and conferences do not give a complete picture, journals were kept to record what the principal did as he worked to improve the school 2 ̆ 7 s program. ^ The techniques used in the data-collection procedures were; formal and informal interviews of the staff and pupils; formal and informal observations of behaviors exhibited by teachers and pupils in the classrooms; self-administered questionnaires for both teachers and pupils and a journal in which the principal recorded observations, interviews and assessments of persons participating in or having an effect on the PCRP. ^ It was seen that many emergent problems arise during the implementation efforts. These problems may impede the implementation if they are not met. Another result of this study was the sensitizing of the participants to the importance of reading and writing daily. The adoption of the innovation by the teachers in the school varied with the majority of the participants being rated from moderate to high on their degree of performance.

40|$|While many {{historians of}} the British Empire have {{dismissed}} {{the presence of}} imperial motifs and themes in Britain {{in the early twentieth}} century, this dissertation identifies and analyzes two discourses of Empire that shaped the material and cultural landscape of London during that period. Chapter one establishes several contexts relating to this period, including New Imperialism, as outlined by Disraeli and later, Joseph Chamberlain. As Disraeli?s New Imperialism evolved, it incorporated the national efficiency movement as a way to make the Empire modern and relevant while maintaining traditional social and political hierarchies, resulting in a cultural milieu of ?conservative modernity. ? While uncovering these ideas in the imperial spectacle of the first four decades of the twentieth century, I employ aspects of critical human geography to demonstrate how those ideas inscribed themselves onto the urban landscape of London. Chapter two describes three royal Jubilees in terms of imperial spectacle. These events reflect an imperial ethos built on the concept of the Empire as modern, prosperous, healthy, and tasked by Providence with a civilizing mission. Once identified, I introduce seemingly opposite ways of talking about the Empire: discourses of exceptionalism, and discourses of degeneration and decline. I explain that these discourses manifest themselves in numerous cultural practices as well as official programs and policies that are then reflected in the <b>urban</b> landscape. A <b>description</b> of the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley in 1924 - 1925 focuses on public and private responses to the dominant narrative of empire. Chapters three and four investigate exceptionalism and decline and provide examples of ?official? responses to these themes, as in the institution of new bureaucracies, such as the Ministry of Health, as well as from ?below,? as in the celebration of Empire Day. A close look at both formal and informal responses to these discourses of exceptionalism proves that patriotic imperialism was {{very much a part of}} the cultural and material landscape of London until 1939, when German bombs erased the landscape of empire, clearing the ground for the construction of a new landscape of nation...|$|R

The surveys are, therefore, very specific in nature and the subjects covered diverse. The Data Archive holds 19 such surveys. Readers are asked to note that, {{with the exception of the}} surveys on the Telephone Service - 69004, 69016, respondents surveyed are self selected from subscribers to the Association's magazine Which? and so the surveys cannot singly be used in descriptive accounts of the British public. Surveys 69005 - 69012 cover various aspects of the housing experiences of Which? readers who moved house in 1967 and 1968. It is here particularly important to remember that the choice strategies and the resources of Which? readers are unlikely to be typical. Main Topics : Data include: identity of designer/builder (6 categories); builder/developer's asking price and price actually paid for property; whether respondent negotiated directly with builder/developer; date of signing contract; whether property was newly built or a conversion of an older property; whether respondent agreed to buy property before it was finished (if yes, amount of contact she had with builder/construction site is noted); whether property was ready by promised date of completion (details of delays are given); finally, whether property had an NHBRC or other guarantee (details recorded) and whether this was of any use. Building defects: respondents are given definitions of 'minor defects' (i. e. less than 15 pounds worth) and serious defects (i. e. more than 15 pounds worth). 14 Classifications of possible defects are listed (e. g. site clearance, plumbing, roofing etc.) and respondents are asked to describe defects (employing the above definitions) in the appropriate category (stating number of defects, standard of repair etc.).

40|$|<b>URBAN</b> LANDSCAPE Between <b>description</b> and representation: {{inside and}} outside the {{landscape}} The panoramas of the city were created to stir emotions, to create expectations and - above all - they aimed to create awareness amongst their observers; as affirmed Walter Benjamin, "true" life is searched throughout the panoramas. That city had it all, it was a city full of events, a city lost in the horizon. The modern cities and their boundaries offer a new light, a flash moves through a white halo that veils the roofs; this new specific light derives from the smog, blinding lights and new machines that were developed to create heat and that spit dense residues changing the sky with their colors. Changes are dictated by the events that create abstract atmospheres, such as the ones found in Turner's painting called "Rain, steam and speed". It is a landscape that changes, it is a city that continues to follow the rhythmic flows of the future, passers-by, vehicles, daily activities [...] . it is a city that runs through time and with time. THE URBAN LANSCAPE is a tool used to reflect, investigate and penetrate within this reality, which is in continuous motion and change. Above all, it is an experiment. The journey involves a panoramic vision that directs the attention towards the daily elements [...] . The landscape is fragmented into a hundred pieces, into frenetic visions, into a turbulent movement of figures, into shortened and detailed images, into spacial relationships between cities and nature, into distorted overlapping situations; where the limit between description and representation is no longer clear. The more the observer takes in the details and is more attentive and ready to observe and memorize the elements and their surroundings, the images begin to scroll faster, sometimes even in slow motion and in some cases they stop and restart: a continuation of dynamic flows that follow each other. Integrated or not to a story, these have the power and will to belong to a summary of images on the city, changing landscape and on the opportunities each one of us is able to perceive, analyze, memorize and observe: a continuously changing place. The landscape is a living being with rhythms, variations and dynamic dimensions. It is a landscape that swiftly follows the rhythm of time; a landscape that simulates itself through its representations, which are more and more abstract and confusing [...] . it is always a different landscape, it never looks the same. From below, within its central knots, the knots of friction and exchange that occur between function and power, the "landscape" represents the fragmented images of the landscape that describe and witness the coming of changes.

Barbara St. Pierre Schneider, Nancy Menzel, Lori Candela, Yu Xu, Sally Miller – Integrating Urban Sustainability into a Doctoral Nursing Program Abstract: According to the World Commission on Environment and Development (1987), people “are the ultimate resource” of sustainability, but to be effective people must be physically and mentally healthy. However, threats to health are of a major concern with global urban population growth and natural and man-made environmental hazards. The most economical and successful approach to counteract these threats is to promote and protect the health of people residing in the urban environment. Nurses have a rich history of working with groups and individuals in diverse urban environments {{on a wide range of}} health issues and are well positioned to play a critical role by discovering actions that promote health, minimizing the risk for and consequences of disease and illness, and communicating these efforts to citizens, employers, and policy makers. To accomplish this end, urban sustainability needs to be integrated into nursing education at the doctoral level. This presentation will consist of four parts: an overview of the evidence supporting nursing as a key discipline in <b>urban</b> sustainability; a <b>description</b> of the initial steps to integrate sustainability into the doctoral nursing curriculum; a presentation of the curriculum; and a discussion of the barriers encountered in developing this curriculum along with solutions to overcoming the barriers. Scott Nowicki – Commuting to UNLV: The Daily Lesson and Action in Sustainability Abstract: There are a number of programs operating in Las Vegas that have the look and feel of community efforts aimed at making life and business more sustainable, such as recycling, alternative energy, and trip reduction programs, but a serious effort is needed to gauge their effectiveness and plan for further development of these programs. The transportation system is an example of a potential significant decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, decrease in overall system costs, and increase in quality of life for residents. The Regional Transportation Commission’s plans for development of a comprehensive bike network, transit, and alternative mode integration are only likely to be successful if travel habits are viewed against the backdrop of the complex social/physical layout of the city. Participants in UNLV’s 400 / 600 GIS course are taking a systematic look at the way we use the transportation system in Las Vegas, as well as the physical layout and limitations of the bike and pedestrian network. Sociology students are focusing on the economic and social characteristics of the bike and public transportation system, while Geoscience students are mapping discrepancies between the publicly available map and the streets network. Using student researchers, these components are being brought together to discern what factors are limiting the Las Vegas metropolitan area from providing a sustainable way for people to get around...|$|R
