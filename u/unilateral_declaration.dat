5|$|After the <b>Unilateral</b> <b>Declaration</b> of Independence (UDI), the British {{government}} {{petitioned the}} United Nations for sanctions against Rhodesia pending unsuccessful talks with Smith's administration in 1966 and 1968. In December 1966, the organisation complied, imposing the first mandatory trade embargo on an autonomous state. These sanctions were expanded again in 1968.|$|E
5|$|While Mugabe was imprisoned, in August 1964, the Rhodesian Front government—now {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Ian Smith—banned ZANU and ZAPU and arrested all remaining leaders of the country's African nationalist movement. Smith's government made a <b>unilateral</b> <b>declaration</b> of independence from the United Kingdom in November 1965, renaming Southern Rhodesia as Rhodesia; the UK refused to recognise the legitimacy of this and imposed economic sanctions on the country.|$|E
5|$|Within the government, Van der Byl {{was one of}} {{the loudest}} voices urging Ian Smith to proceed to a <b>Unilateral</b> <b>Declaration</b> of Independence. He angrily denounced the threat of {{sanctions}} from Britain, saying on 4 May 1965 that economic destruction of Rhodesia would mean total economic destruction of Zambia, formerly Northern Rhodesia. This statement was interpreted as a military threat by David Butler, the Leader of the Opposition. Van der Byl was given the task of selling the UDI to Rhodesian whites and to world opinion. In September 1965, it was announced that he would tour the United Kingdom to promote Rhodesian independence. According to David Steel, he claimed then that France and the United States would lead the international recognition of the UDI government. He was appointed Deputy Minister of Information on 22 October and so was present at, but did not sign, the <b>Unilateral</b> <b>Declaration</b> of Independence on 11 November 1965.|$|E

5|$|Britain's {{remaining}} {{colonies in}} Africa, except for self-governing Southern Rhodesia, were all granted independence by 1968. British {{withdrawal from the}} southern and eastern parts of Africa was not a peaceful process. Kenyan independence was preceded by the eight-year Mau Mau Uprising. In Rhodesia, the 1965 <b>Unilateral</b> <b>Declaration</b> of Independence by the white minority resulted {{in a civil war}} that lasted until the Lancaster House Agreement of 1979, which set the terms for recognised independence in 1980, as the new nation of Zimbabwe.|$|E
5|$|Following Rhodesia's <b>Unilateral</b> <b>Declaration</b> of Independence from Britain on 11 November 1965, the RLI became {{widely known}} for its {{counter-insurgency}} operations during the Rhodesian Bush War against incursions by ZAPU and ZANU's respective military wings, the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) and Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA). The Regiment acquitted itself well in several such operations, with some of its soldiers winning decorations for their actions. Some operations, such as Operations Flotilla and Excess in 1968, involved cooperation with the Portuguese Armed Forces in Mozambique.|$|E
5|$|This was a {{recognition}} of the de facto political situation, as the Patriarch of Constantinople was partially under the political control of the Ottoman Empire. However, faithful people—concerned that having a Catholic {{as the head of the}} Church of Greece would weaken the Orthodox Church—criticised the <b>unilateral</b> <b>declaration</b> of Autocephaly as non-canonical. For the same reason, they likewise resisted the foreign, mostly Protestant, missionaries who established schools throughout Greece.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{alarmed by}} these <b>unilateral</b> <b>declarations,</b> the French {{government}} laid {{claim to a}} strip of the continent in 1924. The basis for their claim to Adélie Land lay on {{the discovery of the}} coastline in 1840 by the French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville, who named it after his wife, Adèle. The British eventually decided to recognize this claim and the border between Adélie Land and Australian Antarctic Territory was fixed definitively in 1938.|$|R
5|$|By the 1960s, Southern Rhodesians' {{service on}} Britain's behalf in the World Wars, {{particularly}} the Second, {{was an integral}} part of the colony's national psyche. The territory had also latterly contributed to British counter-insurgency operations in Malaya, Aden and Cyprus, as well as Operation Vantage in Kuwait. The colonial government's <b>Unilateral</b> <b>Declaration</b> of Independence in 1965 was deliberately made on 11 November, Armistice Day, in an attempt to emphasise the territory's prior war record on Britain's behalf. The proclamation was signed at 11:00 local time, during the customary two-minute silence to remember the fallen.|$|E
5|$|It also {{provided}} for the Court of First Instance (now known as the General Court) to be based in Luxembourg with the Court of Justice, which remained there. However, this agreement dropped the provision from the 1965 decision, which gave priority to Luxembourg for any new judicial and financial bodies. In response, Luxembourg attached a <b>unilateral</b> <b>declaration</b> stating it did not renounce this article. However they did renounce any claim to {{the seat of the}} judicial Boards of Appeal of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market via the Treaty of Nice.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Battalion, The Rhodesian Light Infantry, {{commonly}} the Rhodesian Light Infantry (1RLI or RLI), {{served in}} the Rhodesian Bush War {{as part of the}} Rhodesian Security Forces between 1964 and 1979, under the unrecognised government of Rhodesia following its 1965 <b>Unilateral</b> <b>Declaration</b> of Independence from Britain. During the second half of 1979 it fought for Zimbabwe Rhodesia, a black majority-ruled version of the same state which also failed to win international recognition. After an interim period under British control from December 1979 to April 1980, the RLI briefly remained active within the armed forces of Zimbabwe, but did not see action under this government. It disbanded on 31 October 1980.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{identify}} the main principles governing the interpretation of domestic law clauses that grant jurisdiction to ICSID arbitration and to analyse the meaning of such provisions in the context of the SPP v. Egypt case as the first case on the issue. The article first examines the peculiarities of consent to ICSID jurisdiction by way of national legislation. In the first part the analysis of the practice of arbitral tribunals in which a claim was introduced on the basis of consent to arbitration in domestic law shows that specific language of national legislation on consent to arbitration varies considerably. Therefore, since consent is the “cornerstone” of the Centre’s jurisdiction, arbitral tribunals recognize that not all references to ICSID arbitration in national legislation amount to consent. They approach the task of ascertaining the existence of such consent with great care. In the second part, the article focuses on the SPP v. Egypt case on the issue and analyses challenges that the tribunal met in interpreting relevant national clauses and establishing the consent to arbitration. Finally, this article discusses the legacy of interpretation standard of SPP v. Egypt case in context of the dissenting opinion and further case law. It is argued that the rules of interpretation of domestic law clauses that grant jurisdiction to ICSID arbitration are conditioned by the sui generis nature of consent to arbitration as <b>unilateral</b> <b>declarations</b> capable of giving rise to international legal obligations. Therefore, for the purpose of establishing whether there is consent to arbitration provided in national legislation, international tribunals reasonably take a balanced approach and use the methodological mix of rules of interpretation involving various sources: the VCLT, customary law principles governing <b>unilateral</b> <b>declarations</b> and domestic legislation. Additionally, this article provides suggestions on the possible role of the Guiding Principles applicable to <b>unilateral</b> <b>declarations</b> of states capable of creating legal obligations (Guiding principles) in interpreting domestic provisions containing an offer to arbitrate before ICSID...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the problem of war {{termination}} and the termination of a state of war.

After that he focuses on some other ways of terminating the state of war, that appeared in practice, such as: other agreements, joint <b>declarations,</b> <b>unilateral</b> <b>declarations,</b> the general truce and so...|$|R
5|$|The Rhodesian Prime Minister {{acted as}} Head of His or Her Majesty's Rhodesian Government, under the largely {{symbolic}} supervision of a British colonial Governor, until Rhodesia issued its unrecognised <b>Unilateral</b> <b>Declaration</b> of Independence on 11 November 1965. British-appointed {{figures such as}} the Governor were thereafter ignored by Salisbury. The unrecognised state's system of government, however, remained otherwise unchanged, right down to its declared loyalty to Elizabeth II, which Britain did not acknowledge. This situation remained until March 1970, when Rhodesia adopted a republican system of government. In republican Rhodesia, the Prime Minister instead nominally reported to the President.|$|E
5|$|Welensky {{considered}} a federal <b>unilateral</b> <b>declaration</b> of independence {{when the new}} Northern Rhodesian constitution appeared likely to grant an African majority in its parliament. Determined at one point to prevent changes, Welensky was convinced that if he refused, the British would use military force to remove his government. Believing that preparations were being made for an invasion from Kenya, he discussed the federation's ability to repel an attack with his defence chiefs and plans were set in motion. In the end, {{the idea of a}} British invasion was one of many options considered, and did not make it past cabinet discussion.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from these}} exercises, the RLI Commandos garrisoned {{separate}} {{areas of the}} country; 1 Commando and the Battalion Headquarters were at Kariba, opposite the positions {{taken up by the}} Zambian Defence Force on the border. 2 Commando was at Chirundu, another town on the border with Zambia, and 3 Commando was split between Rhodesia's two Air Force bases: Salisbury's New Sarum base and Thornhill air base in Gwelo. The Battalion received its Queen's and regimental colours, approved two years earlier, from the colonial Governor, Sir Humphrey Gibbs, on 19 June 1965. Meanwhile, negotiations between Smith and Harold Wilson's British Labour government broke down repeatedly throughout the year, leading the Rhodesian government to issue the <b>Unilateral</b> <b>Declaration</b> of Independence on 11 November 1965. Most RLI men supported Smith, the RF and UDI, and so saw this step as cause for celebration.|$|E
50|$|Public {{holidays}} {{observed in}} Rhodesia were largely based around milestones in the region's short history. Annual holidays marked {{various aspects of}} the arrival of white people to the region during the 1880s and 1890s, as well as the respective <b>unilateral</b> <b>declarations</b> of independence (1965) and of republican government (1970). On these days, most businesses and non-essential services closed. A number of Christian holidays were also observed according to custom, in the traditional British manner, and referred to in official documents by name—Christmas Day, for example, or Easter Monday.|$|R
5|$|Public {{holidays}} in Rhodesia, {{a historical}} region in southern Africa equivalent to today's Zimbabwe and Zambia—formerly Southern and Northern Rhodesia, respectively—were largely based around milestones in the region's short history.

30|$|There are {{numerous}} existing legal vehicles through which stakeholders can encourage conflict parties {{to commit to}} reducing civilian vulnerability, e.g. <b>unilateral</b> <b>declarations</b> or special agreements (Mack and Pejic 2008; Lacroix et al. 2011; Jong 2015). Numerous documents created during conflict highlight that these legal mechanisms provide parties, particularly ANSAs, with vehicles for making contractual commitments to civilian protection (Heffes and Kotlik 2014; Sassòli 2010; Rondeau 2011). This paper aims to provide criteria that will guide protection actors and can be adopted in contracts with conflict parties to reduce civilian vulnerability to forced displacement and HLP pillage.|$|R
5|$|Independence {{talks between}} Britain and Rhodesia {{continued}} for a fortnight without major {{reference to the}} Reedman appointment, with Britain more concerned with discussing a possible Rhodesian <b>unilateral</b> <b>declaration</b> of independence (UDI). Smith delivered an openly defiant speech to his parliament on 30 June, attacking Britain for its handling of the Commonwealth's newer members, which he said were unduly influencing British policy in Africa. Britain was desperate to avoid the international humiliation that would accompany the organisation's break-up, he claimed, and was therefore attempting to hold it together by appeasing the less prominent members. While making clear his disdain, the Prime Minister pledged {{to go on with}} negotiations, saying that he did not believe Britain truly endorsed its professed line.|$|E
5|$|Negotiations between Smith and Wilson {{took place}} {{throughout}} the rest of the year, but repeatedly broke down; between July and September, a parallel development concerned Rhodesia's opening of a representative mission in Lisbon, which Britain opposed, but proved unable to stop. Soon after Smith visited London in October 1965, Wilson resolved to curb his rival's ambitions. During his own visit to Salisbury later that month, he proposed to safeguard future black representation in the Rhodesian parliament by withdrawing control over the Rhodesian parliamentary structure to London. Salisbury had held these powers since 1923. This proved the last straw for Smith's Rhodesian government, which issued the <b>Unilateral</b> <b>Declaration</b> of Independence (UDI) on 11 November.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Unilateral</b> <b>Declaration</b> of Independence (UDI) was a {{statement}} adopted by the Cabinet of Rhodesia on 11 November 1965, announcing that Rhodesia, a British territory in southern Africa that had governed itself since 1923, now regarded itself as an independent sovereign state. The culmination of a protracted dispute between the British and Rhodesian governments regarding the terms under which the latter could become fully independent, {{it was the first}} unilateral break from the United Kingdom by one of its colonies since the United States Declaration of Independence nearly two centuries before. Britain, the Commonwealth and the United Nations all deemed Rhodesia's UDI illegal, and economic sanctions, the first in the UN's history, were imposed on the breakaway colony. Amid near-complete international isolation, Rhodesia continued as an unrecognised state with the assistance of South Africa and Portugal.|$|E
30|$|One {{advantage}} of using ceasefire agreements concerns {{the fact that}} their use is already widely accepted by both states and NSAGs, reflected in the prevalence of their adoption. In relation to the conflict in Myanmar alone, for example, ceasefire agreements have been adopted between the government and 14 non-state armed groups (Oo 2014, 7). In light of the reluctance of states to endorse NSAGs’ <b>unilateral</b> <b>declarations</b> or agree to Common Article 3 Special Agreements (premised on a concern that to do so would “grant a degree of legitimacy” upon the group: ICRC 2014, 17), the acceptance by both actors is extremely advantageous.|$|R

5|$|The {{process of}} {{negotiating}} the actual arrangements {{turned out to}} be difficult and lasted from 1563 to 1569, with the Lithuanian magnates, worried about losing their dominant position, being at times uncooperative. It took Sigismunt II's <b>unilateral</b> <b>declaration</b> of the incorporation into the Polish Crown of substantial disputed border regions, including most of Lithuanian Ukraine, to make the Lithuanian magnates rejoin the process, and participate in the swearing of the act of the Union of Lublin on July 1, 1569. Lithuania for the near future was becoming more secure on the eastern front. It's increasingly Polonized nobility made in the coming centuries great contributions to the Commonwealth's culture, but at the cost of Lithuanian national development.|$|E
5|$|Van der Byl {{was born}} and raised in Cape Town, the son of the South African {{politician}} P V van der Byl, and served in the Middle East and Europe during the Second World War. After a high-flying international education, he moved to the self-governing British colony of Southern Rhodesia in 1950 to manage family farms. He went into politics in the early 1960s through his involvement with farming trade bodies, and became a government minister responsible for propaganda. One of the leading agitators for Rhodesia's <b>Unilateral</b> <b>Declaration</b> of Independence in 1965, Van der Byl was afterwards responsible for introducing press censorship. He was unsuccessful in his attempt to persuade international opinion to recognise Rhodesia, but was popular among members of his own party.|$|E

Rival nationalists also used violence against each other as they jostled for prominence. In an attempt to restore confidence in the government and end the political intimidation, Smith cracked down hard on the militant nationalists, arresting political agitators in the townships for criminal offences and jailing ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo in Gonakudzingwa Restriction Camp, a remote detention unit in the country's south-east. The British government, worried that Southern Rhodesia might issue a <b>unilateral</b> <b>declaration</b> of independence (UDI) rather than continue with negotiations, placed troops in Aden on alert.|$|E
25|$|On 8 October 2008, the UN General Assembly resolved, on a {{proposal}} by Serbia, {{to ask the}} International Court of Justice to render an advisory opinion on the legality of Kosovo's declaration of independence.
