It is important to note: at nearly every lane crossing in either direction, and at all ports of entry, a Nexus member can use their Nexus card as proof of citizenship of either Canada or the US. Permanent Residents are still required to carry their passport/passport card, Permanent Resident Card, and any relevant immigration documents for either country, such as I94 or <b>US</b> <b>landing</b> <b>cards</b> (although they may not need to show these items in normal circumstances).|$|R
5000|$|Land: The <b>Land</b> <b>card</b> is {{the main}} source of energy. A player can summon unit, item and spell cards using the souls {{produced}} by <b>land</b> <b>cards.</b> You can put up to 10 <b>land</b> <b>cards</b> on the <b>land</b> field.|$|R
50|$|This {{is similar}} to <b>Land</b> <b>cards</b> in Magic: the Gathering.|$|R
50|$|The Secretary of State decides, {{by issuing}} a Statutory Instrument, which nationalities must {{complete}} a <b>landing</b> <b>card.</b> Currently all EU nationals, and those from Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland, are exempt. Failure {{to complete a}} <b>landing</b> <b>card</b> when this is required is a crime punishable by a fine or six months in prison.|$|R
5000|$|For {{those who}} {{have said that the}} UC! play system, with its use of Foundation <b>cards</b> {{replacing}} Magic's <b>Land</b> <b>cards,</b> and the Draining of Foundation Cards replacing the Tapping of Magic's <b>Land</b> <b>Cards</b> was essentially a [...] "knockoff" [...] of Magic: The Gathering, Dave responds, [...] "Yep, it sure was. But it was fun and a lot of folks enjoyed playing it." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{collation}} of {{the cards}} {{made it possible for}} a basic <b>land</b> <b>card</b> to appear in the common and uncommon slots of a pack. This was intentional; the <b>land</b> <b>cards</b> were printed on the common and uncommon print sheets. Basic lands would get their own full print sheets in 4th Edition, making Revised the last tournament-legal set until Seventh Edition in which basic lands could be found in booster packs. Basic lands returned as a card slot in the Shards of Alara block of 2008.|$|R
50|$|Players {{take their}} turns (or phases) to summon their cards {{in order to}} prepare for Battle Phase. In order to summon any cards, players must have enough souls to summon, which can be {{acquired}} mainly by <b>Land</b> <b>cards</b> on player's backfield. Most <b>Land</b> <b>cards</b> do not require souls to play them. All Spells and Units on the front field engage in combat in the Battle Phase, and remaining cards {{come back to the}} preparation phase, and repeat until one of them wins the game.|$|R
5000|$|... — This card {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as being one of the worst <b>land</b> <b>cards</b> ever printed. Its main use is to be given to an opponent somehow.|$|R
5000|$|... — Basic land. The Arabian Nights [...] "mountain" [...] was {{the only}} basic <b>land</b> <b>card</b> of the set printed, by mistake; no basic lands {{were meant to be}} printed.|$|R

50|$|One recent {{addition}} to the regular Vanguard format is Momir Basic, which involves the Momir Avatar, which allows a player to discard a <b>land</b> <b>card</b> to get a random creature into play. All Momir Basic Decks are constructed entirely of basic land.|$|R
50|$|With the {{exception}} of basic <b>land</b> <b>cards</b> a player's combined deck and sideboard may not contain more than four of any individual card, counted by its English card title equivalent. All cards named Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, Forest, and Wastes are basic.|$|R
50|$|As with Eighth and Ninth Edition, {{part of the}} {{development}} process for Tenth Edition included allowing fans to select certain cards {{for inclusion in the}} set. This process began in mid-June 2006 and continued for 10 weeks. Tenth Edition starter packs include <b>land</b> <b>cards</b> from Magic's next set, Lorwyn.|$|R
50|$|Unglued was {{not entirely}} a commercially {{successful}} expansion, but the unique basic <b>land</b> <b>cards</b> - the only cards from the set legal in tournaments - were and still are valuable. The set also developed a cult following among casual Magic fans, and eventually a sequel set, Unhinged, was released in 2004.|$|R
