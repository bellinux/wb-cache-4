5000|$|Because the rondel is such {{a tightly}} [...] "closed" [...] form, each poem seems to stand as an {{independent}} <b>unit,</b> <b>isolated</b> from the other poems around it. Giraud heightens this sense of disconnection by eschewing sustained narrative, presenting Pierrot's situation {{as a series of}} stark vignettes. Sometimes these vignettes are clustered rather coherently (as in those dealing with Pierrot-as-modern-Christ—27: [...] "The Church", 28: [...] "Evocation", 29: [...] "Red Mass", and 30: [...] "The Crosses"), but, more often than not, they seem random in their placement (and thus may be explained, at least in part, Schoenberg's not scrupling to change their order in his song-cycle). [...] The effect of all these structural and stylistic techniques is both comic and unsettling, as the poem [...] "Disappointment" [...] (4: [...] "Déconvenue") suggests:The scene is completely without context: the poem that precedes it, 3: [...] "Pierrot-Dandy", is about Pierrot's making up his face with moonlight; the poem that follows it, 5: [...] "Moon over the Wash-House", identifies the moon as a washerwoman. Nowhere else in the cycle is this party revisited; it is impossible, therefore, to understand the import of the gathering or the identity of the guests. (Are the [...] "Gilles" [...] among the guests? or are they part of the entertainment? Is it Pierrot who has whimsically stolen away the viands? or is it stingy Cassander?) The frozen gestures ("their forks in their fists"), the air of blank incomprehension (shared as much by the reader as by the guests), the finicking nicety of the language ("elytra" [...] of [...] "elytron" [...] = [...] "wing-case") all contribute to the ambiguous black comedy of the poem.|$|E

The overall organisation is typical of higher eukaryotes, including an intergenic spacer consisting of a subrepeating structure. Atypically, however, the 45 S precursor RNA promoter was shown to lie within the last subrepeat by S 1 mapping; i. e. the last subrepeat extends 90 bp into the ETS. The sequence of the spacer subrepeats, the ETS and the first 151 nucleotides of the 18 S gene was determined. Comparisons with the corresponding regions of other higher eukaryotes, including insects shows that the ETS has completely diverged, raising questions concerning their functional significance and evolutionary retention; depending on the method of alignment, only two short regions of reasonable homology are shared with Drosophila species: a stretch of nucleotides around the transcription initiation site, and AACATA at the NTS- 18 S gene junction; and the functionally important G at - 16, conserved in all other examined species, is displaced no matter what method of alignment is used. These and other features reflect continual processes {{of change in the}} rDNA family to which the several functions of the repeating unit need to adjust...|$|E

This is the first record of the genus from this part of Europe. Mauldinia sp. is described based on peduncles and lateral <b>units.</b> <b>Isolated,</b> slender peduncles show spirally arranged scars or rarely attached lateral <b>units.</b> <b>Isolated</b> lateral <b>units</b> consist of cladode-like structures showing up to seven flower/fruit scars. Some isolated fruits were found associated with peduncles and lateral units. Fruits are ovoid fruits contain a single, elongated seed. The pericarp consists of epicarp, mesocarp and endocarp. The seed consists of two cotyledons containing well-developed reserve cells. Mauldinia sp. from Gard differs from known Mauldinia species by having longer internodes along the peduncle and by {{the shape of the}} lateral units.

40|$|The {{history of}} children's {{services}} {{development in the}} west of Melbourne is one of ongoing challenges and constant change. It is a history which emphasises the pivotal role of women - both paid and unpaid - in establishing services at the local level, in grasping opportunities where they were perceived to exist and in striving to influence public policy at a state and federal level. This history also highlights the significance of regional organisations and processes and the primary role of local government in responding to community needs. As part of the Crow Collection's project on children's services in the western region, funded by the Reichstein Foundation, this paper presents an overview of factors influencing the development of children's services in the west of Melbourne. It also identifies areas of challenge for the future. The paper primarily focuses on developments {{in the field of}} children's services since the 1970 s. By this time it had become clear that the family could no longer be viewed as a private <b>unit,</b> <b>isolated</b> from societal concern. Changes in family structure, member roles and attitudes; increased paid workforce participation by women; ethnic diversity and altering attitudes to disability, indicated that public policy initiatives were required which supported family units in their responsibilities relating to children...|$|E
40|$|During {{breast cancer}} development, the luminal {{space of the}} mammary acinar unit fills with proliferating {{epithelial}} cells that exhibit growth factor-independence, cell attachment defects, and a more invasive fibroblastic phenotype. Here, we used primary cultures of mammary epithelial cells derived from genetically engineered mice to identify caveolin- 1 (Cav- 1) as a critical factor for maintaining the normal architecture of the mammary acinar <b>unit.</b> <b>Isolated</b> cultures of normal mammary epithelial cells retained the capacity to generate mammary acini within extracellular matrix. However, those from Cav- 1 (−/−) mice exhibited defects in three-dimensional acinar architecture, including disrupted lumen formation and epidermal growth factor-independent growth due to hyperactivation of the p 42 / 44 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. In addition, Cav- 1 -null mammary epithelial cells deprived of exogenous extracellular matrix underwent a spontaneous epithelial-mesenchymal transition, with reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, and E-cadherin redistribution. Mechanistically, these phenotypic changes appear {{to be caused by}} increases in matrix metalloproteinase- 2 / 9 secretion and transforming growth factor-β/Smad- 2 hyperactivation. Finally, loss of Cav- 1 potentiated the ability of growth factors (hepatocyte growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor) to induce mammary acini branching, indicative of a more invasive fibroblastic phenotype. Thus, a Cav- 1 deficiency profoundly affects mammary epithelia by modulating the activation state of important signaling cascades. Primary cultures of Cav- 1 -deficient mammary epithelia will provide a valuable new model to study the spatial/temporal progression of mammary cell transformation...|$|E
40|$|The annual monomodal flood {{pulse of}} the Amazon River is a key driver for this {{globally}} important hydrological system. Understanding the behaviour and characteristics of this flood wave and its influence on the dynamics of river and floodplain interaction is important to many studies attempting to quantify processes dependent upon it, including estimates of carbon fluxes from the wetlands and sediment movement to the ocean. The main {{aim of the research}} presented in this thesis was to investigate the hydrodynamic behaviour of the Amazon River and its floodplain, in order to better understand its components and processes. The key scientific question underpinning this aim is: How do the floodplain storage and fluxes affect the passage of the Amazon flood wave and in turn how does the passage of the flood wave control the dynamics on the floodplain? Research was carried out using a synthesis of hydraulic characterisation, numerical modelling, spatial analysis of remote sensing data and field surveys. In combination with information from published floodplain studies, these results were then used to inform the development of a conceptual hydrodynamics framework for the Amazon floodplain. Hydraulic characterisation of the Amazon flood wave was undertaken showing that it is subcritical and diffusive in nature with dominating backwater effects. Experiments with the main channel using hydraulic models showed that main channel water levels were relatively insensitive (0. 5 m error on a 12 m flood wave amplitude) to the geometric representation of the channel and that simplified bathymetry is adequate for calibrated predictions, provided the mean cross sectional area can be reasonably well approximated. Hydraulic model results compare well with observed data despite explicit exclusion of the floodplain, indicating that the storage volume of the floodplain has a minimal affect on the passage of the Amazon flood wave for this reach. The spatial analysis of Landsat TM images shows a total of 1, 762 floodplain channels in the study area with a mean width of 47 m. Shuttle radar topography mission data has difficulty in resolving many of these floodplain channels due to 96 % of the channels having a width less than the SRTM spatial resolution of 90 m. Comparing floodplain channel widths with their frequency reveals a power law relationship, showing patterns of structure that are self-similar over many orders of magnitude. Analysis of the floodplain channel network connectivity showed that the complex floodplain can be divided into floodplain hydrologic units (FHU) and that each unit type has different geomorphic characteristics resulting from a different mixture of water inputs, with each <b>unit</b> <b>isolated</b> from other units for much of the flood cycle by sediment barriers. A field survey of the floodplain channels was conducted in order to measure and characterise their morphology. The findings of this survey together with numerical connectivity experiments, demonstrate that floodplain channels could be playing a much more significant role in the floodplain hydrodynamics then previously acknowledged. Floodplain channels were grouped into three types by depth: (i) for channels carrying only river flood water, depth was strongly correlated with the flood wave’s mean annual range of 11. 4 m; (ii) for channels which carried river flood water and local runoff, the mean depth was substantially deeper at 15. 9 m; and, (iii) main river island channels were deeper again, with a mean depth of 17. 7 m. Finally, a coherent, evidence based, conceptual floodplain hydrodynamics framework was developed to inform a broad range of future Amazon wetland research. The framework represents an extension to the macro level understanding available in the scientific literature and provides an important link between the macro and detailed level study scale.

If the cruise altitude is that for best performance of the <b>isolated</b> <b>unit,</b> the system lift-drag ratio can be no better than twice that of the <b>isolated</b> <b>unit</b> even when an infinite number of units are coupled.

These units usually showed broad receptive fields; and spontaneous activity, when present, showed transitory depressions following responses to natural stimuli. (2) A group of fibers, including many small ones, which responded to proprioceptive stimuli with tonic discharges of varying adaptation rate.
