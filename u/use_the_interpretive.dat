In contrast to the existing timed and untimed instruction set simulators which <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>interpretive</b> simulation technique, our simulator {{is based on the}} compiled simulation principle.

This paper presents an application of the compiled simulation technology on the TMS 320 C 54 x DSP of Texas Instruments. Measurement results on real-life examples show a speedup between 33 and 155 times compared to the currently available sim 54 x simulator of TI.

40|$|It is {{increasingly}} common that public construction projects are procured and managed with explicit intentions to establish closer collaboration between partners. Opportunities for negotiation {{and the freedom}} to choose partners are more restricted in a public setting than in a private one. Thus, many relational requirements that are generally considered essential to trust-based collaboration are more difficult to fulfil. Based on two case studies from the Netherlands and one from Sweden, we investigate how this formalized context, including formal partnering models to support relationship management, influences relational development in public sector construction contracts. Collaboration is primarily needed in projects where uncertainty is high and exchange conditions cannot be comprehensively defined. The contractual ambiguities, together with the limited opportunities for pre-contractual sense-making and relationship-building, imply that the early post-contractual phase is of significantly higher importance in public projects than in private ones. After signing a contract, {{it is important that the}} parties <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>interpretive</b> flexibility to signal trust and commitment and also that joint learning processes are organized to resolve ambiguities and enable joint learning. Formal partnering models are helpful in structuring this interaction, but also incentive arrangements may be important in shaping interaction and signalling trust...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the epistemological {{life cycle of}} the camera lens in documentary practices. The 19 th century industrial economies that manufactured and commercialised the camera lens have engendered political and economic contingencies on documentary practices to sustain a hegemonic and singular interpretive epistemology. Colonial documentary practices are considered {{from the viewpoint of}} manipulative hegemonic practices - all of which <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>interpretive</b> epistemology of the camera lens to capitalise a viewpoint which is singular and possesses the power to sustain its own status and economic privilege. I suggest that decolonising documentary practices can be nurtured in what Boaventura de Sousa Santos proposes as an 'ecology of knowledges' (Andreotti, Ahenakew, & Cooper 2011) - a way of including the epistemologies of cultures beyond the 'abyssal' (Santos), outside the limits of epistemological dominance. If an 'epistemicide' (Santos) of indigenous knowledges in the dominant limits has occurred then in an ecology of knowledges the limits become limitless and what were once invisible knowledges, come into their own ontological and epistemological being: as free agents and on their own terms. In an ecology of knowledges, ignorance and blindness may still exist but are not privileged. The decolonisation of documentary practices inevitably destabilises prevailing historicities and initiates ways for equal privilege to exist between multiple epistemologies...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} nature of arguments {{over the meaning of}} texts. People often disagree about the meaning of texts, with arguments ranging from disagreements over individual words to disagreements over the text's overall sense. Over two thousand years ago, rhetoricians in ancient Greece and Rome classified recurring types of disagreement over the meaning of texts. This classification, known as the legal stases, served as a tool for inventing arguments in favor of the arguer's preferred interpretation. My dissertation recovers and adapts the legal stases as a modern rhetorical method for generating and analyzing arguments over the meaning of texts. In the first chapter, I sketch the history of the legal stases from their origins in ancient Greco-Roman legal discourse to their slide into obscurity in the seventeenth century. I rename them the interpretive stases because scholars can use them to analyze debates revolving around texts from a variety of spheres, including not only law, but also politics, religion, literature, and history. I adopt six interpretive stases: letter versus spirit, contradictory passages, ambiguity, definition, assimilation, and jurisdiction. These six stases offer a reasonably grained slicing of disputes over textual meaning at their roots: from a single word to how a text is applied in novel ways. In the next six chapters, I examine each interpretive stasis in detail with case studies from debates over textual meaning in a variety of settings. Case studies range from a controversy in literary criticism over the racially subversive nature of Phillis Wheatley's poetry in the stasis of ambiguity to a debate in historical scholarship over Lincoln's sexuality as inferred from his correspondence with an alleged male lover in the stasis of assimilation. In my final chapter, I suggest ways that literature and composition teachers might <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>interpretive</b> stases to help students analyze and generate arguments about texts, and I discuss promising intersections between my research and contemporary language science. Thus, my dissertation advances the ability of scholars to analyze the rhetorical dynamics of interpreting texts, trace the evolution of textual meaning, and examine how communities ground their beliefs and behaviors in texts...|$|E

Of the many teen films that circulated in Indonesia one of them that reap the controversy is the film "Virgin" (When Virginity Questionable) by showing how teenage slang, dress sexy. The problems that the lift {{in this study is}} what is the meaning of the signs in the film Virgin viewed from the context of urban youth fashion lifestyle. The study this time using semiotic theory of Charles Sanders Peirce (1834 - 1914) and Roland Barthes (1915 - 1980). In Peirce's semiotics, use the icons for the common term, the Index for a causal relationship, and symbols for the conventional association [...] then also be applied in the denotation and connotation of Roland Barthes. Barthes addresses the second level of meaning systems built over the other systems that have been there before. This second system by Barthes called connotative, denotative or so different from the first level of meaning systems. Furthermore, in the second level related to the contents, sign work through myth. Myths are cultural bagamana explain or understand some aspect of reality or a natural phenomenon. Myth is a vehicle where an intangible ideology. Mythology present incarnation of the meanings that have a container in ideologi. Ideologi should be able to tell. The story was a myth. The methodology used is qualitative perspective, the methods of semiotic analysis, which will <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>interpretive</b> data analysis, in order to gain an understanding of the signs that are considered relevant in the study.

For data analysis, data obtained will be identified and in interpretive in denotative and connotative, and then described in terms of doing the division sign is accompanied by his type icon, index, symbol. After doing the analysis, the level of this study found that sexy underwear model, an urban teen icon right now, sexy clothes are associated with a sleeveless, tight, low cut neck, with a mini dress size above the navel. In denotative layer clothes in the general context is a tool to cover the body from heat and cold. On the connotative layer, figure 3. 1 Biyan, Ketie and Stella walking along with punk-style dress is a symbol of freedom and voiced protest injustice in life. In layer denotative, cigarette is a symbol tranquilizers, stress, familiarizing the association, while the connotative layer, smoking is a tool that can solve the problem. On the denotative level, tattoos and piercings are symbols decorating the body, while the connotative level, tattoos and piercings on the culture of antiquity is to beautify themselves and to the ancestor spirit worship ceremony. In the modern tattoos and piercings are art aesthetics, and prestige in a particular group. From all of the items lifestyle is an index of urban adolescent promiscuity. In the discussion of ideology there are alignments of the filmmakers to the ruler who makes the producer or the absolute market power that makes them (filmmakers must submit to the will and ideology of the market (employers) if {{you do not want to}} be left investors or spectators.

Although there is this fundamental difference in the approach to maintenance, transaction systems maintenance and DW maintenance share many of the same challenges.

Research aspects were extracted from the literature review conducted. The literature review conducted demonstrates what the challenges in maintenance are, how the challenges of transactional systems compare to the challenges of DW maintenance and how the utilities and methods used in DW methodologies can inherently assist in managing these challenges from DW perspective.

An adaptation of the listening guide method (Gilligan, Spencer, Weinberg, & Bertsch, 2003) was used to provide a unique and personal perspective of the phenomenon of giftedness and revealed the feelings behind the themes that emerged in <b>the</b> <b>interpretive</b> phenomenological analysis method. Specifically; this study illuminates the lack of evolution that an individual's understanding and perception of giftedness undergoes across the lifespan, and the impact such a static and school-bound understanding has on gifted adults' self-concept. It also reveals the influence that gifted individuals' innate need to achieve has on their academic aspirations and their perceptions of themselves as gifted. Furthermore, it reveals how important the understanding and internalization of failure can be on the self-concept of gifted individuals, and that this issue needs immediate attention at all levels of education...|$|R
40|$|As {{children}} with ADHD are typically diagnosed at school entry level, when problems with especially {{reading and writing}} occur, primary school teachers are directly affected by a pressing need to become more educated {{on the subject of}} ADHD. The responsibility to teach these young children effectively, and help them to successfully cope with their struggles in an academic environment also rests with the primary school teacher. The {{purpose of this study was}} to gain an understanding of the experiences of primary school teachers who have children diagnosed with ADHD in their classrooms. The phenomenological approach was used as a lens for collecting and interpreting data. Four participants from a private school were interviewed and transcripts were analysed and interpreted <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interpretive</b> Phenomenological Approach. <b>The</b> research findings were that the teachers experiences of having {{children with}} ADHD in their classrooms were both positive and negative and were affected by several factors including the number of diagnosed children in the classroom, the degree of severity of ADHD, support received from others, medication for ADHD and knowledge of ADHD.
