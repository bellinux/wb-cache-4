Despite the controversy of the adequacy or inadequacy of <b>using</b> <b>translation</b> in the teaching of a foreign language, this paper argues that analytical and descriptive studies along with teachers ' observations have revealed valuable additional information about the validity of <b>using</b> <b>translation</b> as a tool for language learning and/or language teaching. Therefore, those who believe that translation has a minimal role to play in the teaching of a foreign language are invited to think again of its role and contributions it makes to the fields oflanguage learning...|$|E

In this paper, we propose a local affine motion prediction method, which manages to enhance the inter-frame image prediction quality using the conventional motion vectors. Our method is characterized {{with the fact that}} no extra bit has to be sent to the decoder for proper decoding. Experimental results show that our method manages to achieve a maximum average bit rate reduction of 1. 7 % compared to the conventional inter-frame prediction method <b>using</b> <b>translation</b> only motion compensation techniques, at no cost on quality degradation.

A student survey about the initial application of translation found their range of expectations for the subject and revealed diversity in their first and second language abilities. The students ’ work showed the common errors they would make even after consulting dictionaries and ‘translation aids’. As a result, ‘translation ’ could be understood from a wider perspective. Finally, possible further development of the act of translating as a teaching methodology in the advanced level second/foreign language class is discussed...|$|E
