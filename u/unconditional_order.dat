40|$|Resumé The {{concept of}} bill of {{exchange}} and promissory note The purpose of the thesis is to describe institutes of {{bill of exchange}} and promissory note and other important institutes of law related to the bill of exchange. The thesis is separated into several parts, in the first chapter I use general characteristic of negotiable instruments for the bill of exchange. In the second chapter I briefly discuss relations {{of the bill of}} exchange, because we have to pay attention not only to the essentials but also to other terms of drawing the bill. In the third chapter I deal with the bill of exchange and promissory note and their essentials. The difference between the bill of exchange and the promissory note is an <b>unconditional</b> <b>order</b> to pay a determinate sum of money by drawer to drawee, which is characteristic for the bill of exchange; whereas the promissory note is characterized by an unconditional promise to pay a determinate sum of money by drawer. The rest of essentials, except for the name of drawee logically, are the same. These essential are the term "bill of exchange" incorporated {{in the body of the}} bill of exchange in the same language as a text of the bill of exchange, maturity, place of payment, name of payee, place and date of drawing a bill of exchange and signature of drawer. In the forth chapter I [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The bill of {{exchange}} {{is a kind of}} paper in order that its holder shall entitle the debtor named in the document to pay a certain amount of payments. The bill {{of exchange}} represents a means of payment and an instrument of providing the payment. It is an <b>unconditional</b> <b>order</b> given by the drawer to the drawee to pay a certain amount to the payee listed on the {{bill of exchange}}. The bill of exchange is generally a paper on the orders but it can be issued as value paper to a name. It is such promissory notes where the issuer becomes a clause not by order. The bill of exchange though it appears as a means of payment and an instrument for securing the payment it also appears as a means of international payment, because the bill of exchange can become a modern instrument of crediting and payment. With the development of the credit market and the bill of exchange becomes a means for the drawer and the drawee. This means that instead of the bill of exchange to be paid after the expiry of a certain deadline for submission of the bill of exchange the holder may sell or discount, or to pay before the deadline for submission. With this the bill of exchange becomes a toll for discount. Based on this we can conclude that the bill of exchange has the following roles: -bill of exchange serves as a means of credit; -bill of exchange serves as means of payment; -bill of exchange serves as a means for discount by. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is bill {{formalism}} {{and development of}} its concept in the judicature. The thesis deals mainly with requirements of a bill of exchange, which are set by law, {{as well as with}} the effect of the failure to meet the correct form of these requirements on validity of bills of exchange. This issue is analysed especially with regard to its concept in the Czech judicature. The first chapter deals with theoretical aspects of the topic, namely with description of the basic legal regulation of exchange law, the characteristics of a bill of exchange and defining the kinds of bills and special types of them. The second chapter focuses on basic requirements of a bill of exchange set by law, which are analysed in particular with regard to their impact on the validity of the bill of exchange. Individual parts of the chapter deal with the following requirements of bills of exchange: 1. indication that it is a bill of exchange, included in the text of the instrument, expressed in the language in which the instrument is drawn up, 2. <b>unconditional</b> <b>order</b> (promise) to pay a certain financial sum, 3. the name of who is to pay, 4. information on maturity, 5. information on the place where payment is to be, 6. the name of the person to whom or to whose order payment is to be, 7. date and place of issue of bill of exchange, 8. signature of the drawer. The third chapter contains issue that is closely connected with the introduction of the above-mentioned requirements on a bill of exchange and which also reflects the formal character of a bill of exchange. The first part of this chapter concentrates on the bill forms, with whose character certain specific problems are related. The second part of this chapter deals with issues of graphic layout of a bill, which has also significant importance in terms of bill formalism...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four papers concerning modelling of count data and tourism demand. For three of the papers {{the focus is on}} the integer-valued autoregressive moving average model class (INARMA), and especially on the ENAR(l) model. The fourth paper studies the interaction between households' choice of number of leisure trips and number of overnight stays within a bivariate count data modelling framework. Paper [I] extends the basic INAR(1) model to enable more flexible and realistic empirical economic applications. The model is generalized by relaxing some of the model's basic independence assumptions. Results are given in terms of first and second conditional and <b>unconditional</b> <b>order</b> moments. Extensions to general INAR(p), time-varying, multivariate and threshold models are also considered. Estimation by conditional least squares and generalized method of moments techniques is feasible. Monte Carlo simulations for two of the extended models indicate reasonable estimation and testing properties. An illustration based on the number of Swedish mechanical paper and pulp mills is considered. Paper[II] considers the robustness of a conventional Dickey-Fuller (DF) test for the testing of a unit root in the INAR(1) model. Finite sample distributions for a model with Poisson distributed disturbance terms are obtained by Monte Carlo simulation. These distributions are wider than those of AR(1) models with normal distributed error terms. As the drift and sample size, respectively, increase the distributions appear to tend to T- 2) and standard normal distributions. The main results are summarized by an approximating equation that also enables calculation of critical values for any sample and drift size. Paper[III] utilizes the INAR(l) model to model the day-to-day movements in the number of guest nights in hotels. By cross-sectional and temporal aggregation an INARMA(1, 1) model for monthly data is obtained. The approach enables easy interpretation and econometric modelling of the parameters, in terms of daily mean check-in and check-out probability. Empirically approaches accounting for seasonality by dummies and using differenced series, as well as forecasting, are studied for a series of Norwegian guest nights in Swedish hotels. In a forecast evaluation the improvements by introducing economic variables is minute. Paper[IV] empirically studies household's joint choice of the number of leisure trips and the total night to stay on these trips. The paper introduces a bivariate count hurdle model to account for the relative high frequencies of zeros. A truncated bivariate mixed Poisson lognormal distribution, allowing for both positive as well as negative correlation between the count variables, is utilized. Inflation techniques are used to account for clustering of leisure time to weekends. Simulated maximum likelihood is used as estimation method. A small policy study indicates that households substitute trips for nights as the travel costs increase. Härtill 4 uppsatser. digitalisering@um...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{determines the}} {{conditions}} under which stochastic orderings of random variables, e. g., stochastic dominance and the monotone likelihood ordering, are preserved or reversed by conditioning on competitive selection. A new stochastic <b>order</b> over <b>unconditional</b> distributions is introduced—geometric dominance—which is sufficient for a random variable, conditioned on competitive selection, to be stochastically dominant and both necessary and sufficient for it to be dominant under the monotone likelihood ratio ordering. Using geometric dominance, we provide an “anatomy of selection bias” by identifying {{the conditions under}} which competitive selection conditioning preserves and reverses <b>unconditional</b> stochastic <b>order</b> relations. We show that, for all standard error distributions (e. g., Normal, Logistic, Laplace), competitive selection preserves stochastic order relations. One implication of this result is that, even in the presence of self-selection bias, the sign of treatment affects can be identified by standard uncorrected OLS and Logit/Probit models. Another is that, for almost all “textbook” distribution families, MLRP ordering is preserved by competitive selection...|$|R
40|$|We analyze {{empirical}} {{share allocation}} practices in Italian IPOs, which are run as two separate offerings, one for retail investors who submit <b>unconditional</b> binding <b>orders</b> {{and another for}} institutional investors who submit only indications of interest. The effective allocation proportion between the two offerings is determined by {{a high level of}} syndicate discretion but before the bookbuilding period starts.

We document significant increases of the retail offering size ex post and show that this is done by more reputable underwriters in IPOs with lower institutional demand, a higher proportion of secondary shares and significantly lower levels of initial underpricing. As a result, retail investors end up buying more shares only in less profitable IPOs, although the net economic effect on their expected returns is rather small.
