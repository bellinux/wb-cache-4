5|$|To {{reliably}} {{enable a}} charge-only feature, modern USB accessory peripherals now include charging cables that provide power {{connections to the}} host port but no data connections, and both home and vehicle charging docks are available that supply power from a converter device and do not include a host device and data pins, allowing any capable USB device to charge or operate from a standard <b>USB</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{physical}} USB device may {{consist of}} several logical sub-devices that {{are referred to}} as device functions. A single device may provide several functions, for example, a webcam (video device function) with a built-in microphone (audio device function). This kind of device is called a composite device. An alternative to this is compound device, in which the host assigns each logical device a distinctive address and all logical devices connect to a built-in hub that connects to the physical <b>USB</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|E

5|$|Some USB devices {{require more}} power than is {{permitted}} by the specifications for a single port. This is common for external hard and optical disc drives, and generally for devices with motors or lamps. Such devices can use an external power supply, which is allowed by the standard, or use a dual-input <b>USB</b> <b>cable,</b> one input of which is used for power and data transfer, the other solely for power, which makes the device a non-standard USB device. Some USB ports and external hubs can, in practice, supply more power to USB devices than required by the specification but a standard-compliant device may not depend on this.|$|E

The Zen Xtra does not support the FM tuner from the original Zen and does not have recording functionality.|$|E
25|$|Flexible {{keyboards}} are a junction between normal {{type and}} laptop type keyboards: normal from the full arrangement of keys, and laptop from the short key distance. Additionally, the flexibility allows {{the user to}} fold/roll the keyboard for better storage and transfer. However, for typing the keyboard must be resting on a hard surface. The vast majority of flexible keyboards in the market are made from silicone; this material makes them water and dust proof, a very pleasant feature especially in hospitals where keyboards are subjected to frequent washing.

It is also able to record FM radio and voice on its internal memory. This player is not considered as a descendant of the c200 series, as it only plays audio. It is more similar to the m200 series and maintains much of its design and internal software structure. It is the world's first known cable-less flash-based digital audio player, though a <b>USB</b> <b>cable</b> {{is included in the}} package if one is required to be used.|$|E
25|$|The PSP Go {{features}} 802.11b Wi-Fi {{like its}} predecessors, {{but no longer}} uses a standard USB A-to-Mini-B cable common with many devices. A new proprietary multi-use connector is used for USB connectivity. A suitable <b>USB</b> <b>cable</b> is included with the unit. The new multi-use connector allows for charging and USB similar to previous units, as well as video and sound output with the same connector (using an optional composite or component AV cable), unlike previous offerings which had TV OUT and USB functionality on separate ports. Sony also offers an optional cradle for charging and USB data transfer on the PSP Go, similar to previous offerings. The PSP Go adds support for Bluetooth connectivity, enabling the use of compatible Bluetooth headsets and tethering with Bluetooth-enabled mobile phones. This also enables users to connect and play games using a Sixaxis or DualShock 3 PlayStation 3 controller or Bluetooth Headset.|$|E
500|$|The G2 {{ships with}} Android 4.2.2 [...] "Jelly Bean" [...] with a custom {{interface}} and software. It contains {{a number of}} features {{that are designed to}} [...] "learn" [...] from users by predicting future actions, and allow for flexibility and customization. The G2 retains features from previous LG models such as the Optimus G and G Pro, including QuickMemo (which allows users to write notes on top of a screenshot), QuickRemote (a feature which allows the device to serve as a universal remote), QSlide pop-up apps, and Voice Mate. New features introduced by the G2 include TextLink, which analyzes text messages to detect content such as addresses and times that can be passed to other apps (such as the calendar, a note, or Google Maps), a pop-up menu of relevant apps triggered when plugging in headphones or a <b>USB</b> <b>cable</b> (Plug & Pop), the ability to answer a phone call by holding the phone to the user's head (AnswerMe), Slide Aside, a multitasking feature which allows users to [...] "slide" [...] away apps onto cards with a three-finger gesture, the Clip Tray (which collects content that had been copied to the clipboard), and Guest Mode. The G2 uses on-screen buttons; users can change their background color (which includes black and white options, either solid colored or with a gradient), customize the order of the buttons, or add additional buttons for opening QuickMemo or the notification shade. The G2's default music player supports the playback of WAV and FLAC files with 24-bit/192kHz audio.|$|E

50|$|Connecting any two {{computers}} using USB {{requires a}} special proprietary bridge cable. A directly connected pin-to-pin <b>USB</b> type A <b>cable</b> does not work, as USB {{does not support}} such a type of communication. In fact, attempting to do so may even damage the connecting computers, as it will effectively short the two computers' power supplies together by connecting their 5V and GND lines. This can possibly destroy one or both machines and cause a fire hazard since the two machines may not have exactly the same USB source voltage. Therefore, Direct <b>Cable</b> Connection over <b>USB</b> is not possible; a <b>USB</b> link <b>cable</b> must be used, {{as seen in the}} Microsoft knowledge base article 814982. However, with a <b>USB</b> link <b>cable,</b> a program which supports data transfer using that cable must be used. Typically, such a program is supplied with the <b>USB</b> link <b>cable.</b> The DCC wizard or Windows Explorer cannot be used to transfer files over a <b>USB</b> link <b>cable.</b>|$|R
