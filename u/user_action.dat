25|$|When {{activity}} {{recognition is}} performed indoors and in cities using the widely available Wi-Fi signals and 802.11 access points, {{there is much}} noise and uncertainty. These uncertainties are modeled using a dynamic Bayesian network model by Yin et al. A multiple goal model that can reason about user's interleaving goals is presented by Chai and Yang, where a deterministic state transition model is applied. A better model that models the concurrent and interleaving activities in a probabilistic approach is proposed by Hu and Yang. A <b>user</b> <b>action</b> discovery model is presented by Yin et al., where the Wi-Fi signals are segmented to produce possible actions.|$|E

Turning Cortana off does not in itself delete user data stored on Microsoft's servers, but it can be deleted by <b>user</b> <b>action.</b> Microsoft has further been criticised for {{requests}} to Bing's website for a file called [...] "threshold.appcache" [...] which contains Cortana's information through searches made through the Start Menu even when Cortana is disabled on Windows 10.|$|E

50|$|Administrator {{accounts}} are heavily monitored {{due to the}} high profile nature of their access. However, current log tools can generate “log fatigue” on these admin accounts. Log fatigue is the overwhelming sensation of trying to handle {{a vast amount of}} logs on an account as a result of too many <b>user</b> <b>actions.</b> Harmful <b>user</b> <b>actions</b> can easily be overlooked with thousands of <b>user</b> <b>actions</b> being compiled every day.|$|R

40|$|When {{understanding}} modern web {{usage and}} providing optimized personalized service, {{it is important}} to identify the HTTP(S) requests directly caused by <b>user</b> <b>actions</b> like clicks and typing web addresses. With a majority of HTTP(S) requests being due to content that has not been explicitly requested by a user, the problem of identifying <b>user</b> <b>actions</b> at proxies or middleboxes becomes non-trivial. We present an automated evaluation framework for identifying <b>user</b> <b>actions</b> while also automatically providing a "ground truth" of the <b>user</b> <b>actions.</b> We utilize the framework to compare the performance of timing-based and HTTP-aware request classifiers, including timing-based classifiers operating on both per-request and per-connection basis to identify <b>user</b> <b>actions.</b> We emphasize the value of diverse information used by the classifiers when comparing identification accuracy both among classifiers and relative to the browser-based ground truth. Our classifiers can be useful to better understand users web usage and connection prioritization...|$|R
40|$|Riedl, Saretto, & Young 2003) {{describes}} narrative mediation, a plan-based {{technique for}} addressing human <b>user</b> <b>actions</b> that {{conflict with the}} story structure maintained by computer-controlled agents within interactive narrative environments. This technique is used to generate real-time system responses to unanticipated <b>user</b> <b>actions</b> while balancing <b>user</b> freedom with story coherence. Narrative mediation has previously only been used for a single plan representing an entire story. A high amount of computation is required to monitor <b>user</b> <b>actions</b> and, in response, replan as appropriate to avoid {{a threat to the}} story’s consistency. Toward the goal of maintaining plan consistency, use of a single planner is limited in that it can process only a single <b>user’s</b> <b>actions.</b> To handle multiple users, distributing the planning burden across several planners requires collaborative communication to maintain global consistency. We propose a method that extends Riedl, Saretto and Young’s mediation techniques to allow for mediation of exceptional <b>user</b> <b>actions</b> within a narrative environment consisting of many users. 1...|$|R

40|$|We propose {{an active}} sensing method {{that uses a}} mobile phone’s {{acceleration}} sensor and its vibration motor as an actuator to estimate the phone’s situation and its <b>user’s</b> <b>action.</b> This method overcomes the problem of existing methods: despite obtaining accurate action estimation from a single acceleration sensor, they cannot estimate the phone’s situation because they utilize differences in acceleration sensor data caused by <b>user</b> <b>actions</b> and estimate the <b>user’s</b> <b>action</b> based on that change. Our method vibrates the mobile phone by using its vibration motor under pulse width modulation (PWM) control and extracts the feature quantities from the acceleration sensor data. It then simultaneously estimates the <b>user’s</b> <b>action</b> (dynamic items) and phone’s situation (static items) with high accuracy from the differences in feature quantities...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The LADS (Log Analysis for Digital Societies) task at CLEF aims at {{investigating}} <b>user</b> <b>actions</b> in a multilingual setting. We {{carried out}} {{an analysis of}} search logs with the objectives of investigating how users from different linguistic or cultural backgrounds behave in search, and how the discovery of patterns in <b>user</b> <b>actions</b> {{could be used for}} community identification. The findings confirm that users from a different background behave differently, and that there are identifiable patterns in the <b>user</b> <b>actions.</b> The findings suggest that there is scope for further investigation of how search logs can be exploited to personalise and improve cross-language search as well as improve the TEL search system. ...|$|R
