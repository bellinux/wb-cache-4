5|$|Khaplu Palace {{was built}} in 1840 by the Yabgo Raja Daulat Ali Khan of Khaplu after the Dogra of Kashmir who {{captured}} the region decided to move the seat of government from the old fort.

The pile of dead animals in the back of Cletus' truck originally included dead puppies, but the animators thought it was too sad, so they removed them. Scully used to write jokes for Yakov Smirnoff so he called him up to get the signs in Russian.
