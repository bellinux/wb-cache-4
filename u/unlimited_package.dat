This frequency information coupled with associated bearing information was then used to provide continuous tar gel fixes. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R
50|$|In 2006, Nigerian {{immigrants}} to Japan began opening {{a number of}} bars and nightclubs in the area, following an earlier group of innovators {{who had been in}} business in Roppongi for many years. The Nigerians were noted for using visible, high-pressure tactics to draw customers to their bars. In 2009 and 2010 a series of drink-spiking incidents, in which customers reported being drugged and robbed, were linked to Nigerian-owned bars. The incidents resulted in the United States embassy in Japan warning US citizens to avoid certain bars and clubs in Roppongi. An investigation by the Japan Times in July 2011 found that though drink spiking occurred, most of the incidents did not involve criminal activity. Many customers claimed unusually severe hangovers after nights spent in Nigerian-run establishments. Similar complaints are often made about non-Nigerian bars in Roppongi that offer <b>unlimited</b> drink <b>packages</b> and often lace drinks with hard liquor to minimize customer consumption and increase profit.|$|R
40|$|In {{the scope}} of INNOMONT within the R and D project 'JEDEC Level 1 procedures' the {{subjects}} active surface treatment of leadframes by fine particle flash techniques and local roughening with laser beams were investigated. The treatments were acquired with an expert institute and tested on demonstrator packages. Relating to package and backend technology the requirements and the influences on quality components for memory products were investigated. Materials and demonstrator packages were tested in accordance to JEDEC Level 1 moisture sensitivity stressing and tested with regard to pass quality level 1 (robust <b>package,</b> <b>unlimited</b> floor life). The crucial criteria like adhesion to the connection partners (mold compound-leadframe; mold compound-polyimide etc.) were worked out and confirmed positively on a lab model. (orig.)

40|$|This paper studies markets, such as Internet marketplaces for {{used cars}} or mortgages, in which {{consumers}} engage in sequential search. In particular, {{we consider the}} impact of information-brokers (experts) who can, for a fee, provide better information on true values of opportunities. We characterize the optimal search strategy given a price and the terms of service set by the expert, and show how to use this characterization to solve the monopolist expert’s service pricing problem. Our analysis enables the investigation of three common pricing schemes (pay-per-use, <b>unlimited</b> subscription, and <b>package</b> pricing) {{that can be used}} by the expert. We demonstrate that in settings characteristic of electronic marketplaces, namely those with lower search costs for consumers and lower costs of production of expert services, unlimited subscription schemes are favored. Finally, we show that the platform that connects consumers and experts can improve social welfare by subsidizing the purchase of expert services. The optimal level of subsidy forces the buyer to exactly fully internalize the marginal cost of provision of expert services. In electronic markets, this cost is minimal, so it may be worthwhile for the platform to make the expert freely available to consumers...|$|R
