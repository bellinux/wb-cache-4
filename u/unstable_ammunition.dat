50|$|Since 2003 HALO {{has also}} had an {{independent}} Weapons & Ammunition Disposal (WAD) project, which has worked in every region of Afghanistan. Initially the WAD teams concentrated on the disposal of the significant quantities of degraded and <b>unstable</b> <b>ammunition</b> that were amassed across the country after {{the formation of the}} present government. After destroying those stocks HALO's focus became the location and destruction of ammunition stocks that lie outside of direct government control. Invariably these are small caches of buried munitions that are often degraded and unsuitable to be used for conventional warfare but can still pose a threat to communities. In total the HALO Afghanistan WAD teams have destroyed 23,000 tonnes of ammunition.|$|E
40|$|Ammunition {{accounting}} {{refers to}} information management {{systems and the}} associated operating procedures {{that are designed to}} record, numerically monitor, 1 verify, issue, and receive ammunition in stockpiles. Accurate accounting of stockpiles is an essential control measure in stock-pile management and security, one that can quickly identify stockpile losses or inaccuracies resulting from misplaced munitions, and wrongly issued or illicitly diverted stocks. Comprehensive accounting procedures are also a core component of effec-tive technical surveillance of ammunition. When used to record physical in-spection reports, they facilitate the management of <b>unstable</b> <b>ammunition</b> and thereby help to minimize the risks of explosion. Maintaining a comprehensive national stockpile inventory Stockpile safety and security apply to all state security force stocks of ammunition within a given country. These stocks, which encompass those of militaries, police forc-es, and other government agencies, can together be termed the ‘national stockpile’. 2 They comprise operational ammunition stocks (used to support routine oper-ations), war reserve ammunition, training ammunition, experimental ammuni-tion, ammunition at the point of manufacture, and ammunition awaiting disposal (Wilkinson, 2006, p. 232). Effective accounting procedures need to apply to all these categories of ammunition if states are to keep risks to safety and security within acceptable limits and maximize the efficient use of the national stockpile. 50 Conventional Ammunition in Surplus As Table 5. 1 illustrates, accounting is a core component of most stockpile management and security procedures. It can be roughly divided into two broad activities, contributing to the safety of stocks (i. e. minimizing the risk of explosion) and maintaining security (i. e. minimizing the risk of loss or diver-sion that could result in ammunition entering the illicit market). Accurate ac-counting of the national stockpile therefore necessitates the classification of ammunition for the purposes of monitoring: 1) the physical and chemical condition of stocks; and 2) the necessary measures required to secure particu-lar types of stocks from loss or theft...|$|E
2500|$|The <b>unstable</b> cordite <b>ammunition</b> {{carried by}} Invincible, {{coupled with the}} {{weakness}} of her turret design and armour, and bad ammunition handling practices, resulted in a catastrophic explosion from [...] "Q" [...] turret's magazine, which blew the ship into two halves which sank separately, each protruding from the sea as the inner end settled on the shallow bottom. Of Invincibles 1,021 crew, there were just six survivors, pulled from the water by attendant destroyers. Hood was not amongst them. The Battle of Jutland was ultimately an expensive stalemate; both sides suffered further losses during the night action but the strategic situation remained unchanged. The Royal Navy had suffered over 6,000 fatal casualties, three times the German losses, but remained {{in control of the}} North Sea while the High Seas Fleet was forced to retire to harbour.|$|R
5000|$|Zillion (ジリオン): {{a mysterious}} weapon, {{impossible}} {{to analyze and}} reproduce. It fires a load of a strange substance, appearing as a red light that engulfs the target and disintegrates it. It uses a small red crystal ("zillionium") for <b>ammunition,</b> <b>unstable</b> and also impossible to reproduce. One of the guns is destroyed in episode 10 and reconstructed afterwards by Dave, changing its initially [...] "flat" [...] design to a more ergonomic one. All pistols are then rebuilt, allowing the use of special accessories that change them into a sub machine-gun, used by Apple, or a precision sniper rifle, used by Champ.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to neutralizing munitions or bombs, conducting training and presenting evidence, EOD Technicians and Engineers also respond to other problems. They dispose of old or unstable explosives, such as ones used in quarrying or mining, {{as well as}} old or <b>unstable</b> fireworks and <b>ammunition.</b> They escort VIPs and dignitaries. They assist specialist police units, raid and entry teams with boobytrap detection and avoidance. Another function of an EOD technician is the conducting of post-blast investigations. The EOD technician's training and experience with bombs make them {{an integral part of}} any bombing investigation. Another part of an EOD technician's job involves supporting the government intelligence units. This involves searching all places that the high ranking government officers or other protected dignitaries travel, stay or visit.|$|R
