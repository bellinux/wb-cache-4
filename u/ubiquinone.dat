5|$|Many {{eukaryotic}} organisms have electron transport chains {{that differ}} from the much-studied mammalian enzymes described above. For example, plants have alternative NADH oxidases, which oxidize NADH in the cytosol {{rather than in the}} mitochondrial matrix, and pass these electrons to the <b>ubiquinone</b> pool. These enzymes do not transport protons, and, therefore, reduce <b>ubiquinone</b> without altering the electrochemical gradient across the inner membrane.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the inner}} {{mitochondrial}} membrane, the lipid-soluble electron carrier coenzyme Q10 (Q) carries both electrons and protons by a redox cycle. This small benzoquinone molecule is very hydrophobic, so it diffuses freely within the membrane. When Q accepts two electrons and two protons, it becomes {{reduced to the}} ubiquinol form (QH2); when QH2 releases two electrons and two protons, it becomes oxidized back to the <b>ubiquinone</b> (Q) form. As a result, if two enzymes are arranged so that Q is reduced {{on one side of}} the membrane and QH2 oxidized on the other, <b>ubiquinone</b> will couple these reactions and shuttle protons across the membrane. Some bacterial electron transport chains use different quinones, such as menaquinone, in addition to <b>ubiquinone.</b>|$|E
5|$|As the {{electrons}} pass through this complex, four protons are pumped from the matrix into the intermembrane space. Exactly how this occurs is unclear, {{but it seems}} to involve conformational changes in complex I that cause the protein to bind protons on the N-side of the membrane and release them on the P-side of the membrane. Finally, {{the electrons}} are transferred from the chain of iron–sulfur clusters to a <b>ubiquinone</b> molecule in the membrane. Reduction of <b>ubiquinone</b> also contributes to the generation of a proton gradient, as two protons are taken up from the matrix as it is reduced to ubiquinol (QH2).|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{thermodynamic}} {{behavior of}} representative short (UQ 2), middle (UQ 4 and UQ 6) and long-chain (UQ 10) <b>ubiquinones</b> (UQ) mixed with dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) was studied in monolayers at the air–water interface. The influence of isoprenoid chain-length of UQ on miscibility of both lipids was investigated by analysis of surface pressure-area isotherms and using fluorescence microscopy. Analysis of excess areas (Aex) and free energies of mixing (ΔGm), calculated from compression isotherms {{in the full}} range of <b>ubiquinones</b> concentrations, has given evidences for UQ-rich constant-size (UQ 6, UQ 10) or less growth limited (UQ 2, UQ 4) microdomains formation within mixed films. Fluorescence microscopy observation revealed that <b>ubiquinones</b> are preferentially soluble in the expanded phase. When lateral pressure increased, concomitant evolutions of Aex and ΔGm parameters, and composition dependence of collapse surface pressures, argue for an evolution towards a total segregation, never reached due to expulsion of <b>ubiquinones</b> from the film. The possible significance of these observations is discussed in relation to <b>ubiquinones</b> organization and similar chain length effects in membranes...|$|R
40|$|Two new <b>ubiquinones,</b> named antrocinnamone and 4 -acetylantrocamol LT 3, were {{isolated}} along with six known <b>ubiquinones</b> from Antrodia cinnamomea (Polyporaceae) mycelium. The developed HPLC analysis methods successfully identified eight different <b>ubiquinones,</b> two benzenoids, and one maleic acid derivative from A. cinnamomea. The <b>ubiquinones</b> 1 – 8 exhibited potential and selective cytotoxic activity against three human cancer cell lines, with IC 50 values ranging from 0. 001 to 35. 883 μM. We {{suggest that the}} different cytotoxicity levels were related to their chemical structures, especially the 4 -hydroxycyclohex- 2 -enone ring {{and the presence of}} a free hydroxyl group in the side chain. The suppression by 4 -acetylantrocamol LT 3 stopped the cell cycle {{at the beginning of the}} G 2 -M phase thus making the cell cycle arrest at the sub-G 1 phase as compared with control cells...|$|R

5|$|As {{coenzyme}} Q {{is reduced}} to ubiquinol {{on the inner side}} of the membrane and oxidized to <b>ubiquinone</b> on the other, a net transfer of protons across the membrane occurs, adding to the proton gradient. The rather complex two-step mechanism by which this occurs is important, as it increases the efficiency of proton transfer. If, instead of the Q cycle, one molecule of QH2 were used to directly reduce two molecules of cytochrome c, the efficiency would be halved, with only one proton transferred per cytochrome c reduced.|$|E
5|$|Prokaryotes {{control their}} use of these {{electron}} donors and acceptors by varying which enzymes are produced, in response to environmental conditions. This flexibility is possible because different oxidases and reductases use the same <b>ubiquinone</b> pool. This allows many combinations of enzymes to function together, linked by the common ubiquinol intermediate. These respiratory chains therefore have a modular design, with easily interchangeable sets of enzyme systems.|$|E
5|$|The {{electron}} transport pathways {{produced by}} these alternative NADH and <b>ubiquinone</b> oxidases have lower ATP yields than the full pathway. The advantages {{produced by a}} shortened pathway are not entirely clear. However, the alternative oxidase is produced in response to stresses such as cold, reactive oxygen species, and infection by pathogens, {{as well as other}} factors that inhibit the full electron transport chain. Alternative pathways might, therefore, enhance an organisms' resistance to injury, by reducing oxidative stress.|$|E
40|$|The prenols of Blakeslea trispora {{were found}} to be a mixture of C,,-C, prenols and a-dihydroprenols with C,o as the main type; the {{principal}} <b>ubiquinones</b> were ubiquinone-g and its (side-chain) dihydro-derivative. A minus strain contained higher levels of prenols, <b>ubiquinones,</b> ergosterol, and p-carotene than a plus strain, and the levels of all four types of isoprenoid were higher again in mated cultures. The overall increase in isoprenoid synthesis in mated cultures was sometimes tenfold but the different isoprenoid types were not all equally affected by the mating process; possible roles for the different types in sexual differentiation are considered...|$|R
2500|$|EPSP is {{subsequently}} dephosphorylated to chorismate, {{an essential}} precursor for the amino acids mentioned above. [...] These amino acids {{are used in}} protein synthesis and to produce secondary metabolites such as folates, <b>ubiquinones,</b> and naphthoquinone.|$|R
40|$|<b>Ubiquinones</b> (UQ) are {{important}} electron transporters and play lot of {{important roles in}} most organisms. In different species, UQ was classified to be UQ- 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 according to their polyprenyl side chain length. The side chain’s length {{is determined by the}} enzyme named Poly-Prenyl diphosphate Synthases (PPPS). Bacteria are usually reconstructed to producing UQ- 10 used in human’s food additive, medicine or cosmetics, such as using decaprenyl Diphosphate Synthase (DPS) gene from R. radiobacter to substitute E. coli’s octaprenyl diphosphate synthase gene, just like BL 21 (∆ispB::ddsA) used in this study. It is interesting that not only in these reconstructed bacteria, but in human-being, DPS can synthesize UQ- 9 besides UQ- 10. The mechanism of this phenomenon is still unknown. In this study, the effects of culture conditions, including the temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and culture medium, on the DPS characteristics in BL 21 (∆ispB::ddsA) were examined. Results show that temperature greatly affects the ratio of UQ- 9 /UQ- 10, but not the total <b>ubiquinone’s</b> production. Increasing dissolved oxygen and protein concentration in culture medium can promote total <b>ubiquinone’s</b> production, but not the ratio of UQ- 9 /UQ- 10. These results may give reference for UQ- 10 ’s industrial produce and the mechanism of these conditions’ effect on DPS will be discussed...|$|R
5|$|Antioxidants are {{classified}} into two broad divisions, {{depending on whether}} they are soluble in water (hydrophilic) or in lipids (lipophilic). In general, water-soluble antioxidants react with oxidants in the cell cytosol and the blood plasma, while lipid-soluble antioxidants protect cell membranes from lipid peroxidation. These compounds may be synthesized in the body or obtained from the diet. The different antioxidants are present at {{a wide range of}} concentrations in body fluids and tissues, with some such as glutathione or <b>ubiquinone</b> mostly present within cells, while others such as uric acid are more evenly distributed (see table below). Some antioxidants are only found in a few organisms and these compounds can be important in pathogens and can be virulence factors.|$|E
5|$|Succinate-Q oxidoreductase, {{also known}} as complex II or succinate dehydrogenase, is a second entry point to the {{electron}} transport chain. It is unusual {{because it is the}} only enzyme that is part of both the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Complex II consists of four protein subunits and contains a bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor, iron–sulfur clusters, and a heme group that does not participate in electron transfer to coenzyme Q, but is believed to be important in decreasing production of reactive oxygen species. It oxidizes succinate to fumarate and reduces <b>ubiquinone.</b> As this reaction releases less energy than the oxidation of NADH, complex II does not transport protons across the membrane and does not contribute to the proton gradient.|$|E
5|$|The redox {{energy from}} NADH and FADH2 is {{transferred}} to oxygen (O2) in several steps via the electron transport chain. These energy-rich molecules are produced within the matrix via the citric acid cycle but are also produced in the cytoplasm by glycolysis. Reducing equivalents from the cytoplasm can be imported via the malate-aspartate shuttle system of antiporter proteins or feed into the electron transport chain using a glycerol phosphate shuttle. Protein complexes in the inner membrane (NADH dehydrogenase (<b>ubiquinone),</b> cytochrome c reductase, and cytochrome c oxidase) perform the transfer and the incremental release of energy is used to pump protons (H+) into the intermembrane space. This process is efficient, but {{a small percentage of}} electrons may prematurely reduce oxygen, forming reactive oxygen species such as superoxide. This can cause oxidative stress in the mitochondria and may contribute to the decline in mitochondrial function associated with the aging process.|$|E

50|$|The apicoplast is {{also thought}} to {{have a role in}} isoprenoid synthesis, which are {{prosthetic}} groups on many enzymes and also act as precursors to <b>ubiquinones</b> (involved in electron transport) and dolichols (involved in glycoprotein formation). The apicoplast contains the DOXP pathway for isoprenoid synthesis and is the sole site for synthesis in the Plasmodium genome.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIsoprenoid quinones {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} groups of compounds occurring in membranes of living organisms. These compounds are composed of a hydrophilic head group and an apolar isoprenoid side chain, giving the molecules a lipid-soluble character. Isoprenoid quinones function mainly as electron and proton carriers in photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport chains and these compounds show also additional functions, such as antioxidant function. Most of naturally occurring isoprenoid quinones belong to naphthoquinones or evolutionary younger benzoquinones. Among benzoquinones, the most widespread and important are <b>ubiquinones</b> and plastoquinones. Menaquinones, belonging to naphthoquinones, function in respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport chains of bacteria. Phylloquinone K 1, a phytyl naphthoquinone, functions in the photosynthetic electron transport in photosystem I. <b>Ubiquinones</b> participate in respiratory chains of eukaryotic mitochondria and some bacteria. Plastoquinones are components of photosynthetic electron transport chains of cyanobacteria and plant chloroplasts. Biosynthetic pathway of isoprenoid quinones has been described, as well as their additional, recently recognized, diverse functions in bacterial, plant and animal metabolism...|$|R
25|$|Coenzyme Q10, {{also known}} as <b>ubiquinone,</b> ubidecarenone, {{coenzyme}} Q, and abbreviated at times to CoQ10 , CoQ, or Q10 is a coenzyme that is ubiquitous in animals and most bacteria (hence the name <b>ubiquinone).</b> It is a 1,4-benzoquinone, where Q refers to the quinone chemical group and 10 refers {{to the number of}} isoprenyl chemical subunits in its tail.|$|E
25|$|Complex I {{contains}} a <b>ubiquinone</b> binding pocket at the interface of the 49-kDa and PSST subunits. Close to iron-sulfur cluster N2, the proposed immediate electron donor for <b>ubiquinone,</b> a highly conserved tyrosine constitutes a critical {{element of the}} quinone reduction site. A possible quinone exchange path leads from cluster N2 to the N-terminal beta-sheet of the 49-kDa subunit. All 45 subunits of the bovine NDHI have been sequenced. Each complex contains noncovalently bound FMN, coenzyme Q and several iron-sulfur centers. The bacterial NDHs have 8-9 iron-sulfur centers.|$|E
25|$|The ubiquinone-binding {{protein is}} a nucleus-encoded {{component}} of ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (Complex III; EC 1.10.2.2) in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and {{plays an important}} role in electron transfer as a complex of <b>ubiquinone</b> and QP-C.|$|E
40|$|The phylum Verrucomicrobia {{is defined}} by phylogenetic {{analysis}} of 16 S rRNA gene sequences of cultured strains and environmental clone sequences retrieved {{from a wide variety}} of environments. All cultivated members of the phylum stain Gram-negative; many have intracellular compartments bounded by internal membranes. Menaquinones are the dominant respiratory quinones; <b>ubiquinones</b> have not been detected. Most members are chemoheterotrophs, preferring carbohydrates including complex natural polysaccharides. Recently isolated members are thermoacidophilic methylotrophs...|$|R
40|$|The {{metabolism}} of sulfide, sulfur, and acetate by Beggiatoa alba {{was investigated}} under oxic and anoxic conditions. B. alba oxidized acetate to carbon dioxide with the stoichiometric reduction of oxygen to water. In vivo acetate oxidation was suppressed by sulfide and by several classic respiratory inhibitors, including dibromothymoquinone, an inhibitor specific for <b>ubiquinones.</b> B. alba also carried out an oxygen-dependent conversion of sulfide to sulfur, a reaction that was inhibited by several electron transport inhibitors {{but not by}} dibromothymoquinone, indicating that the electrons released from sulfide oxidation were shuttled to oxygen without the involvement of <b>ubiquinones.</b> Intracellular sulfur stored by B. alba was not oxidized to sulfate or converted to an external soluble form under aerobic conditions. On the other hand, sulfur stored by filaments of Thiothrix nivea was oxidized to extracellular soluble oxidation products, including sulfate. Sulfur stored by filaments of B. alba, however, was reduced to sulfide under short-term anoxic conditions. This anaerobic reduction of sulfur {{was linked to the}} endogenous oxidation of stored carbon and to hydrogen oxidation...|$|R

The best substrates of CBR1 are quinones, including ubiquinone-1 and tocopherolquinone (vitamin E). <b>Ubiquinones</b> (coenzyme Q) are constitutive {{parts of the}} respiratory chain, and tocopherolquinone protects lipids of biological membranes against lipid peroxidation, indicating that CBR1 may {{play an important role}} as an oxidation-reduction catalyst in biological processes.|$|R
25|$|All redox {{reactions}} {{take place}} in the hydrophilic domain of complex I. NADH initially binds to complex I, and transfers two electrons to the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) prosthetic group of the enzyme, creating FMNH2. The electron acceptor – the isoalloxazine ring – of FMN is identical to that of FAD. The electrons are then transferred through the FMN via a series of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, and finally to coenzyme Q10 (<b>ubiquinone).</b> This electron flow changes the redox state of the protein, inducing conformational changes of the protein which alters the pK values of ionizable side chain, and causes four hydrogen ions to be pumped out of the mitochondrial matrix. <b>Ubiquinone</b> (CoQ) accepts two electrons to be reduced to ubiquinol (CoQH2).|$|E
25|$|The {{equilibrium}} {{dynamics of}} Complex I are primarily {{driven by the}} quinone redox cycle. In conditions of high proton motive force (and accordingly, a ubiquinol-concentrated pool), the enzyme runs in the reverse direction. Ubiquinol is oxidized to <b>ubiquinone,</b> and the resulting released protons reduce the proton motive force.|$|E
25|$|Complex I is also {{blocked by}} {{adenosine}} diphosphate ribose – a reversible competitive inhibitor of NADH oxidation – by binding to the enzyme at the nucleotide binding site. Both hydrophilic NADH and hydrophobic <b>ubiquinone</b> analogs act {{at the beginning}} and the end of the internal electron-transport pathway, respectively.|$|E
40|$|Representative {{strains of}} each of the named species of Legionella were {{examined}} for isoprenoid quinones by reverse-phase thin-layer chromatography. All strains contained three or more <b>ubiquinones</b> (Q 9, Q 10, Q 11, Q 12, Q 13) which were useful for placing the species into one of three distinct groups. Group 1 contained L. longbeachae, L. bozemanii, L. dumoffi, and L. gormanii; group 2 contained only L. micdadei; and group 3 contained only L. pneumophila.

Ethanol has no effect upon the rate of catalysis, leading to a non-inhibiting perturbation of cytochrome bc 1 function. We suggest that displacement occurs by ethanol acting from the aqueous phase to successfully compete with the Qo site <b>ubiquinones</b> and water to hydrogen bond the NϵH atom(s) of the coordinating [2 Fe- 2 S] cluster histidines...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} study of the lipid composition of 26 strains (including type strains) of marine Gammaproteobacteria belonging to the genera Shewanella, Alteromonas, Pseudoalteromonas, Marinobacterium, Microbulbifer, and Marinobacter was carried out. The bacteria exhibited genus-specific profiles of <b>ubiquinones,</b> phospholipids, and fatty acids, which can serve as reliable chemotaxonomic markers for tentative identification of new isolates. The studied species of the genus Shewanella were distinguished {{by the presence of}} two types of isoprenoid quinones, namely, <b>ubiquinones</b> Q- 7 and Q- 8 and menaquinones MK- 7 and MMK- 7; five phospholipids typical of this genus, namely, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), lyso-PE, and acyl-PG; and the fatty acids [15 : 0, 16 : 0, 16 : 1 (n- 7), 17 : 1 (n- 8), i- 13 : 0, and i- 15 : 0]. The high level of branched fatty acids (38 – 45 %) and the presence of eicosapentaenoic acid (4 %) may serve as criteria for the identification of this genus. Unlike Shewanella spp., bacteria of the other genera contained a single type of isoprenoid quinone: Q- 8 (Alteromonas, Pseudoalteromonas, Marinobacterium, and Microbulbifer) or Q- 9 (Marinobacter). The phospholipid compositions of these bacteria were restricted to three components: two major phospholipids (PE and PG) and a minor phospholipid, bisphosphatidic acid (Alteromonas and Pseudoalteromonas) or DPG (Marinobacterium, Microbulbifer, and Marinobacter). The bacteria exhibited genus-specific profiles of fatty acids...|$|R
25|$|Analysis of {{substrate}} specificity {{revealed that the}} enzyme almost exclusively catalyzes the reduction of plastoquinone over other quinones such as <b>ubiquinone</b> and duroquinone. Additionally, iron {{is essential for the}} catalytic function of the enzyme and cannot be substituted by another metal cation like Cu2+, Zn2+, or Mn2+ at the catalytic center.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{more than}} 50 {{years of study}} of complex I, no inhibitors {{blocking}} the electron flow inside the enzyme have been found. Hydrophobic inhibitors like rotenone or piericidin most likely disrupt the electron transfer between the terminal FeS cluster N2 and <b>ubiquinone.</b> It {{has been shown that}} long-term systemic inhibition of complex I by rotenone can induce selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} redox states of CoQ10: fully {{oxidized}} (<b>ubiquinone),</b> semiquinone (ubisemiquinone), and fully reduced (ubiquinol). The capacity of this molecule {{to act as}} a two-electron carrier (moving between the quinone and quinol form) and a one-electron carrier (moving between the semiquinone and one of these other forms) is central to its role in the electron transport chain due to the iron–sulfur clusters that can only accept one electron at a time, and as a free radical-scavenging antioxidant.|$|E
40|$|Development of {{new drugs}} {{is one of}} the {{strategies}} for malaria control. The biosynthesis of several isoprenoids in Plasmodium falciparum was recently described. Interestingly, some intermediates and final products biosynthesized by this pathway in mammals differ from those biosynthesized in P. falciparum. These facts prompted us to evaluate various terpenes, molecules with a similar chemical structure to the intermediates of the isoprenoids pathway, as potential antimalarial drugs. Different terpenes and S-farnesylthiosalicylic acid were tested on cultures of the intraerythrocytic stages of P. falciparum, and the 50 % inhibitory concentrations for each one were found: farnesol, 64 μM; nerolidol, 760 nM; limonene, 1. 22 mM; linalool, 0. 28 mM; and S-farnesylthiosalicylic acid, 14 μM. All the terpenes tested inhibited dolichol biosynthesis in the trophozoite and schizont stages when [1 -(n) - 3 H]farnesyl pyrophosphate triammonium salt ([3 H]FPP) was used as precursor. Farnesol, nerolidol, and linalool showed stronger inhibitory activity on the biosynthesis of the isoprenic side chain of the benzoquinone ring of <b>ubiquinones</b> in the schizont stage. Treatment of schizont stages with S-farnesylthiosalicylic acid led to a decrease in intensity of the band corresponding a p 21 ras protein. The inhibitory effect of terpenes and S-farnesylthiosalicylic acid on the biosynthesis of both dolichol and the isoprenic side chain of <b>ubiquinones</b> and the isoprenylation of proteins in the intraerythrocytic stages of P. falciparum appears to be specific, because overall protein biosynthesis was not affected. Combinations of some terpenes or S-farnesylthiosalicylic acid tested in this work with other antimalarial drugs, like fosmidomycin, could be a new strategy for the treatment of malaria...|$|R
40|$|The {{supercritical}} CO 2 {{extraction of}} microbial quinones from activated sludge samples obtained from various activated sludge was investigated and {{compared to the}} conventional method using organic solvent extraction. The extraction {{was carried out in}} a supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) system in the temperature range of 25 to 75 oC and the pressure up to 30 MPa. Different extraction conditions, such as the temperature, pressure, extraction time and modifier were employed to maximize the SFE efficiency. Significant amount of microbial quinones (<b>ubiquinones</b> and menaquinones) could be extracted rapidly with supercritical CO 2. Results on the value of diversity and dissimilarity suggested that the SFE with supercritical CO 2 extraction was a reliable technique for quinones extraction...|$|R
