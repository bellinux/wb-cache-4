2500|$|A rootkit is a {{collection}} of computer software, typically malicious, designed to enable access to a computer or areas of its software that would not otherwise be allowed (for example, to an <b>unauthorized</b> <b>user)</b> and often masks its existence or the existence of other software. The term rootkit is a concatenation of [...] "root" [...] (the traditional name of the privileged account on Unix-like operating systems) and the word [...] "kit" [...] (which refers to the software components that implement the tool). The term [...] "rootkit" [...] has negative connotations through its association with malware.|$|E
50|$|In particular, a {{properly}} secured SMTP mail relay should not accept and forward arbitrary e-mails from non-local IP addresses to non-local mailboxes by an unauthenticated or <b>unauthorized</b> <b>user.</b>|$|E
50|$|Author Clifford Stoll, PhD, an {{astronomer}} by training, managed computers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. One day in 1986 his supervisor, Dave Cleveland, {{asked him to}} resolve a US$0.75 accounting error in the computer usage accounts. Stoll traced the error to an <b>unauthorized</b> <b>user</b> who had apparently used 9 seconds of computer time and not paid for it. Stoll eventually realized that the <b>unauthorized</b> <b>user</b> was a hacker who had acquired Superuser access to the LBNL system by exploiting a vulnerability in the movemail function of the original GNU Emacs.|$|E

50|$|An <b>unauthorized</b> <b>user</b> {{can obtain}} {{security}} information (factory preset passphrase and/or Wi-Fi Protected Setup PIN) from a label on a {{wireless access point}} can use this information (or connect by the Wi-Fi Protected Setup pushbutton method) to commit unauthorized and/or unlawful activities.|$|E
50|$|Virtual {{payments}} are {{claimed to be}} secure and easy to administer, and {{reduce the risk of}} an <b>unauthorized</b> <b>user</b> compromising card information. They also reduce the number of checks a purchasing department has to process for vendors, thereby achieving significant cost savings.|$|E

30|$|Spectrum pooling {{system was}} {{proposed}} by Jondral et al. [7]. It is a centralized network architecture based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Its suitable scenarios include spectrum share in OFDM wireless {{local area network}} (WLAN) and global system for mobile communication (GSM) network. The architecture involves both authorized and <b>unauthorized</b> <b>users,</b> in which <b>unauthorized</b> <b>users</b> could detect authorized users through sensors and send collected information to base station so that base station could periodically broadcast the usage conditions to all users.|$|R
5000|$|The {{attack surface}} of a {{software}} environment {{is the sum of}} the different points (the [...] "attack vectors") where an <b>unauthorized</b> <b>user</b> (the [...] "attacker") can try to enter data to or extract data from an environment. Keeping the attack surface as small as possible is a basic security measure.|$|E
5000|$|In example 1, if Alice cannot share a {{code-book}} with Bob and Willie is {{not able}} to verify if the packets are sent by authorized user or <b>unauthorized</b> <b>user</b> (Alice), Alice can insert [...] packets of her own to Bob covertly. The results can be extended to more general models where packet timings are modeled by a renewal point process.|$|E
50|$|Back Orifice and Back Orifice 2000 {{are widely}} {{regarded}} as malware, tools intended {{to be used as}} a combined rootkit and backdoor. For example, at present many antivirus software packages identify them as trojan horses. This classification is justified by the fact that BO2k can be installed by a trojan horse, in cases where it is used by an <b>unauthorized</b> <b>user,</b> unbeknownst to the system administrator.|$|E

50|$|On July 30, 2015, Kamkar {{introduced}} OwnStar - a small {{electronic device}} {{that could be}} concealed on or near a General Motors vehicle to interpose itself between the vehicle's OnStar link and the driver's OnStar RemoteLink app. In this classic man-in-the-middle attack, Kamkar, or any <b>unauthorized</b> <b>user,</b> could substitute his OnStar commands to locate, unlock, or start the vehicle. By August 11, General Motors had released upgrades to the OnStar server software and RemoteLink app to block such attacks.|$|E
50|$|An <b>unauthorized</b> <b>user</b> gaining {{physical}} {{access to}} a computer is most likely able to directly copy data from it. They may also compromise security by making operating system modifications, installing software worms, keyloggers, covert listening devices or using wireless mice. Even when the system is protected by standard security measures, these {{may be able to}} be by-passed by booting another operating system or tool from a CD-ROM or other bootable media. Disk encryption and Trusted Platform Module are designed to prevent these attacks.|$|E
50|$|WeMo {{switches}} {{are controlled}} via IP networks; thus, for a switch to be controllable from a remote location, {{it must be}} open to receive connections from the Internet. In January 2013, {{it was revealed that}} the WeMo had a security flaw in its UPnP implementation that allowed an <b>unauthorized</b> <b>user</b> to take control of a switch. This could allow malicious attacks, such as flipping the switch at a very fast rate, which could damage certain devices and even cause electrical fires.|$|E
30|$|We {{prove that}} <b>unauthorized</b> <b>users</b> and Cloud Server cannot decrypt {{ciphertext}} CT that was encrypted by the proposed scheme. Since we assume Cloud Server is honest, {{we do not}} consider active attacks from Cloud Server by colluding with <b>unauthorized</b> or revoked <b>users.</b> We define two attack models and security models as follows.|$|R
50|$|This {{defense is}} simple to {{implement}} {{and has the}} advantage of providing a measure of protection against <b>unauthorized</b> <b>users</b> accessing an authorized user's account by using a machine that may have been left unattended.|$|R
50|$|A virus {{may allow}} <b>unauthorized</b> <b>users</b> to access a phone to find {{passwords}} or corporate data stored on the device. Moreover, {{they can be}} used to commandeer the phone to make calls or send messages at the owner's expense.|$|R
50|$|During {{the closing}} credits, it is {{revealed}} that Lisa finally got her Turbo Diary. When {{she goes to}} sleep, Bart sneaks in and steals the diary using a pair of tongs. While the house was shown, Bart is heard walking to Homer and asking him to read him a bedtime story. Homer accepts, and asks Bart {{to give him the}} diary. He opens it and gets electrocuted as a result of being an <b>unauthorized</b> <b>user.</b> The episode ends with Bart laughing at his gullible father's excruciating pain and misery.|$|E
5000|$|All WPS {{methods are}} {{vulnerable}} to usage by an <b>unauthorized</b> <b>user</b> if the wireless access point is not kept in a secure area. [...] Many wireless access points have security information (if it is factory-secured) and the WPS PIN printed on them; this PIN is also often found in the configuration menus of the wireless access point. If this PIN cannot be changed or disabled, the only remedy {{is to get a}} firmware update to enable the PIN to be changed, or to replace the wireless access point.|$|E

50|$|Two-factor {{authentication}} is {{an option}} in iOS to ensure that even if an unauthorized person knows an Apple ID and password combination, they cannot {{gain access to the}} account. It works by requiring not only the Apple ID and password, but also a verification code that is sent to a device that is already known to be trusted. If an <b>unauthorized</b> <b>user</b> attempts to sign in using another user's Apple ID, the owner of the Apple ID receives a notification that allows them to deny access to the unrecognized device.|$|E
50|$|Function {{pointers}} are obfuscated by XOR-ing with {{a random}} number, {{so that the}} actual address pointed to is hard to retrieve. So would be to manually change a pointer, as the obfuscation key used for the pointer {{would be very hard}} to retrieve. Thus, it is made hard for any <b>unauthorized</b> <b>user</b> of the function pointer to be able to actually use it. Also metadata for heap blocks are XOR-ed with random numbers. In addition, check-sums for heap blocks are maintained, which is used to detect unauthorized changes and heap corruption. Whenever a heap corruption is detected, the application is killed to prevent successful completion of the exploit.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{computer}} network link, where timings of packet transmission are modeled by a Poisson point process with rate , Alice wishes to transmit covert data to Bob, {{in the presence}} of a warden, Willie, who is monitoring the channel between Alice and Bob and can verify if they are generated by the authorized user or <b>unauthorized</b> <b>user</b> (Alice). Also, Bob, receives the packets after their timings are changed because of passing through an M/M/1 queue. Alice can change the packet timings according to a code-book shared with Bob, and covertly transmit [...] covert bits to Bob within the time period [...] The results can be extended to more general models where packet timings are modeled by a renewal point process.|$|E
50|$|By {{protecting}} against data theft, CloudMask DDM {{acts as a}} compliance {{solution for}} organizations subject to data privacy regulations such as HIPAA, GDPR , and PCI. <b>Unauthorized</b> <b>users</b> who breach perimeter security can only see the masked data and data privacy is upheld.|$|R
50|$|Preventive {{controls}} {{strengthen the}} system against incidents, generally by reducing if not actually eliminating vulnerabilities. Strong authentication of cloud users, for instance, makes it {{less likely that}} <b>unauthorized</b> <b>users</b> can access cloud systems, and more likely that cloud users are positively identified.|$|R
50|$|Unix {{provides}} security {{mechanisms to}} prevent <b>unauthorized</b> <b>users</b> from killing other processes. Essentially, for {{a process to}} send a signal to another, {{the owner of the}} signaling process must be the same as the owner of the receiving process or be the superuser.|$|R
