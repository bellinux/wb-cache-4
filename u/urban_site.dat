Leaves (1 year old) of Q. ilex and surface soil (0 – 5 cm) surrounding the trees were collected at seven natural and seven <b>urban</b> <b>sites</b> in Campania Region (Southern Italy) and analyzed for the concentrations of macro (C, N, P, S) and micronutrients (Mn, K, Na, Cu, Mg, Ca, Fe, Zn). The available soil fraction of micronutrients was also evaluated. The nutrients showed different concentration ranges for the natural and the <b>urban</b> <b>sites</b> in the soil (total and available) and in the leaves, that we reported separately. Organic-matter content and macronutrient concentrations {{were higher in the}} natural soils, while the highest leaf N, S, and P concentrations were found at some <b>urban</b> <b>sites.</b> Concentrations of Cu, Na and Zn both in leaves and soil, and Mg and Fe in leaves from the <b>urban</b> <b>sites</b> appeared to be affected by air depositions. Manganese was the only micronutrient to show higher concentrations at the natural than at the <b>urban</b> <b>sites,</b> both in soil and leaves. For this nutrient, in addition, a relationship between leaf and available soil concentrations was found at the natural sites. The ratios between the concentrations of N and each studied nutrient in the leaves highlighted a different nutritional status between the plants from the natural and <b>urban</b> <b>sites...</b>|$|R

25|$|Yehud was {{considerably}} {{smaller than the}} old kingdom of Judah, stretching from around Bethel in the north to about Hebron in the south (although Hebron itself was unpopulated throughout the Persian period), and from the Jordan River and Dead Sea in the east to, but not including, the shephelah (the slopes between the Judean highlands and the coastal plains in the west). After the destruction of Jerusalem the centre of gravity shifted northward to Benjamin; this region, once {{a part of the}} kingdom of Israel, was far more densely populated than Judah itself, and now held both the administrative capital, Mizpah, and the major religious centre of Bethel. Mizpah continued as the provincial capital for over a century. The position of Jerusalem before the administration moved back from Mizpah is not clear, but from 445 BCE onwards it was once more the main city of Yehud, with walls, a temple (the Second Temple) and other facilities needed to function as a provincial capital, including, from 420 BCE, a local mint striking silver coins. Nevertheless, Persian-era Jerusalem was tiny: about 1500 inhabitants, even as low as 500 according to some estimates. It was the only true <b>urban</b> <b>site</b> in Yehud, the bulk of the province's population lived in small unwalled villages. This picture did not much change throughout the entire Persian period. The entire population of the province remained around 30,000. There is no sign in the archaeological record of massive inwards migration from Babylon, in contradiction to the biblical account where Zerubbabel's band of returning Israelite exiles alone numbered 42,360.|$|E
2500|$|The Mississippian {{culture was}} {{spread across the}} Southeast and Midwest from the Atlantic coast {{to the edge of}} the plains, from the Gulf of Mexico to the Upper Midwest, {{although}} most intensively in the area along the Mississippi River and Ohio River. One of the distinguishing features of this culture was the construction of complexes of large earthen mounds and grand plazas, continuing the moundbuilding traditions of earlier cultures. They grew maize and other crops intensively, participated in an extensive trade network, and had a complex stratified society. [...] The Mississippians first appeared around 1000 CE, following and developing out of the less agriculturally intensive and less centralized Woodland period. The largest <b>urban</b> <b>site</b> of this people, Cahokia—located near modern East St. Louis, Illinois—may have reached a population of over 20,000. [...] Other chiefdoms were constructed throughout the Southeast, and its trade networks reached to the Great Lakes and Gulf of Mexico. At its peak, between the 12th and 13th centuries, Cahokia was the most populous city in North America. (Larger cities did exist in Mesoamerica and South America.) Monk's Mound, the major ceremonial center of Cahokia, remains the largest earthen construction of the prehistoric New World. The culture reached its peak in about 1200–1400 CE, and in most places, it seems to have been in decline before the arrival of Europeans.|$|E

40|$|We {{compared}} the invertebrate production and stable isotope signatures of key ecosystem compartments of <b>urban</b> <b>sites</b> {{subjected to the}} input of tertiary-treated wastewater with those of upstream sites in an agricultural lowland stream. We detected a significant shift in the trophic basis of invertebrate production from upstream, natural and agricultural resources, to urban resources, i. e., wastewater-derived organic matter as well as autochthonous primary production based on wastewater-derived nutrients. Invertebrate production was higher at <b>urban</b> <b>sites</b> than at agricultural sites. However, the median contribution {{of the most important}} secondary producer, the shredder Gammarus roeseli, to total invertebrate production was lower at <b>urban</b> <b>sites</b> (9 %) than at agricultural sites (61 %). The low production of G. roeseli at <b>urban</b> <b>sites</b> was associated with the absence of allochthonous coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) habitats, rather than the loss of CPOM as a food resource. Our results suggest that contemporary urban stressors in developed countries affect secondary producers less severely than historically recorded, but still profoundly change the matter fluxes and ecosystem functioning of running waters. Restoration of the native riparian vegetation, channel naturalization, and adequate dilution of tertiary-treated wastewater may partially mitigate adverse effects on invertebrate communities and their secondary production...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, {{a limited}} number of species and genera {{dominate}} the tree stock in streets and <b>urban</b> <b>sites,</b> and recent surveys in European and North American cities show that few species/genera continue to dominate.

The sam- plings were carried out from 25 <b>urban</b> <b>sites</b> (roads with different traffc flows as well as urban and suburban parks) and from two remote areas as controls. Relative to 1989, the values measured in 1996 denote a strong decrement of S, Fe, Na, Pb, and Cr, {{with the exception of}} S in control sites. By contrast, C, N and Cd contents were higher in 1996 than in 1989. Cu and Ni showed a conspicuous increment in control sites as well as in <b>urban</b> <b>sites</b> facing the sea and in the parks, while in all the other <b>urban</b> <b>sites</b> these elements decreased remarkably. No significant difference was found in the leaf contents of Mn, Zn and V measured in 1989 relative to 1996. Both in 1989 and 1996 the contents of N, S, Fe, Na, Cu, Pb, V, Ni, Cr and Cd were significantly higher in leaves from <b>urban</b> <b>sites</b> than in the controls, reflecting the high degree of contamination of the urban area.

40|$|Urbanization is {{accelerating}} globally, {{causing a}} variety of environmental changes such as increases in air temperature, precipitation, atmospheric CO 2, and nitrogen (N) deposition. However, effects of these changes on forest soil carbon (C) sequestration remain largely unclear.

40|$|International audienceThe {{ability of}} chemistry-transport models (CTMs) to {{accurately}} simulate particulate matter {{in urban areas}} is still to be demonstrated. This study presents a statistical evaluation of the performances of a mesoscale aerosol CTM over the Paris area, calculated over a long time period. Model simulations are compared to measured particulate matter PM(10) and PM(2. 5) levels at monitoring ground stations. In summer, the PM 10 daily mean levels are fairly well predicted by the model at all stations with correlation coefficients exceeding 0. 67, relatively low biases (< 2. 5 mu g m(- 3)) and normalized errors (< 27 %). The relatively uniform negative biases suggest that the background PM(10) levels are underestimated. In winter, discrepancies between the model and observations are more important, in particular at <b>urban</b> <b>sites</b> where several erroneous peaks are simulated. Consequently, the correlation coefficient drops down to 0. 59 at <b>urban</b> <b>sites</b> and PM(10) values are overestimated by about 10 mu g m(- 3) with normalized errors exceeding 55 %. We assume that discrepancies between simulated and observed PM levels are due to (i) TEOM (tapered element oscillating microbalance) measurement underestimation (35 % in winter) caused by the evaporation of ammonium-nitrate, (ii) the under-prediction of the model vertical mixing over the urban heat island and (iii) possible overestimation of local PM emissions. We use corrections for the urban boundary layer height and we subtract ammonium-nitrate from model PM(10) concentrations. These modifications significantly improve the comparison statistics at <b>urban</b> <b>sites</b> in winter: the mean bias (< 2 mu g m(- 3)) and normalized error (< 30 %) are reduced, while the correlation coefficient increased to 0. 64. However, the overestimation at <b>urban</b> <b>sites</b> is inconsistent with the underestimation of PM 10 background concentrations. The analysis of the total model biases at <b>urban</b> <b>sites</b> reveals that the underprediction of PM(10) background levels is largely compensated by their local overprediction due to the overestimation of anthropogenic emissions...|$|R
