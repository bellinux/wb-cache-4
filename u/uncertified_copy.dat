The original copy of the vital record is always kept by the government authority. In the United States vital records are public {{and in most cases}} can be viewed by anyone in person at the governmental authority. [...] Copies can also be requested for a fee. [...] There are two types of copies: certified and <b>uncertified.</b> Certified <b>copies</b> are official copies that can be used as identification whereas <b>uncertified</b> <b>copies</b> do not contain the governmental authority's seal and often are marked that they should not be used for identification. There may be additional restrictions in place on who can actually request a certified copy, such as immediate family or someone with written authorization. [...] Certified copies are usually much more expensive than <b>uncertified</b> <b>copies.</b> Some states have started making vital records available online for free. [...] Vital records that are online typically are 90 or more years old and assume the person listed in the record is no longer alive.|$|R
