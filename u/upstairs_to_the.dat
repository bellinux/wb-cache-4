5|$|Never {{was there}} such a dame school as ours, so firm and kind and smelling of galoshes, with the sweet and fumbled music of the piano lessons {{drifting}} down from <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lonely schoolroom, where only the sometimes tearful wicked sat over undone sums, or to repent a little crime– the pulling of a girl's hair during geography, the sly shin kick under the table during English literature.|$|E
5|$|Best was {{studying}} at the Collegiate Grammar School {{when he decided}} he wanted to be in a music group, so Mona bought him a drum kit from Blackler's music store and Best formed his own band; The Black Jacks, who later played in The Casbah. Chas Newby joined the group, as did Ken Brown, but only after he had left The Quarrymen. The reason for Brown's exit from the group was that he turned up on the seventh Saturday night of The Quarrymen residency at The Casbah with the flu, so Mona ordered him <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Best's living room to rest. This caused a massive quarrel {{with the rest of the}} group when Mona came to pay them, as they wanted Brown's money to be shared amongst the three of them, as Brown had not played. Mona refused, so The Quarrymen angrily cancelled their residency and stormed out.|$|E

Colin Manley from The Remo Four was also given a booking to play in the club, which was the only venue that young amateur bands could play at the time. Other groups like The Searchers and Gerry & The Pacemakers later played in the club. The Black Jacks became the resident group at The Casbah, although The Quarrymen occasionally played there again and often visited. It was in The Casbah Club that Lennon and McCartney convinced Sutcliffe to buy a Hofner president bass guitar and join The Quarrymen.|$|E

25|$|More than 20 {{additional}} {{people were}} injured in the explosion, {{one of whom was}} Addie Mae's younger sister, 12-year-old Sarah Collins, who had 21 pieces of glass embedded in her face and was blinded in one eye. In her later recollections of the bombing, Collins would recall that in the moments immediately before the explosion, she had observed her sister, Addie, tying her dress sash. Another sister of Addie Mae Collins, 16-year-old Junie Collins, would later recall that shortly before the explosion, she had been sitting {{in the basement of the}} church reading the Bible and had observed Addie Mae Collins tying the dress sash of Carol Denise McNair before she had herself returned <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground floor of the church.|$|E
25|$|Kenny Dalglish moved <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{position}} of Director of Football {{at the end}} of the Premier League winning season, and handed over the reins to his assistant Ray Harford. Blackburn Rovers made a poor start to the 1995–96 season, and found themselves in the bottom half for most of the first half of the season. Rovers also struggled in the Champions League and finished bottom of their group with just four points. A terrible start to the 1996–97 Premier League campaign saw Harford resign in late October with the club bottom of the division, having failed to win any of their first ten games. Relegation looked a real possibility, just two seasons after winning the league. After an abortive attempt to bring in Sven-Göran Eriksson as manager, long-serving coach Tony Parkes took over as manager for the rest of the campaign, narrowly steering the side to survival. That summer, the manager's job was taken by Roy Hodgson, who joined the club from Internazionale. UEFA Cup football was secured with a 6th-place finish. However, Rovers made a poor start to the 1998–99 campaign and Hodgson was sacked in December less than an hour after a 2–0 home defeat by bottom side Southampton, a result that locked Rovers in the relegation zone. He was replaced as manager by Brian Kidd. However, he could not save them as the club slipped away, relegation was confirmed with a scoreless draw at home to Manchester United in the penultimate game of the season.|$|E
500|$|Since {{the museum}} was {{equipped}} with motion detectors, the thieves' movements throughout the museum were recorded. After tying up the guards, the thieves went <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Dutch Room. As one of them approached Rembrandt's Self-Portrait (1629), a local alarm sounded, which they immediately smashed. They pulled the painting {{off the wall and}} [...] attempted to take the wooden panel out of its heavy frame. Unsuccessful at the attempt, they left the painting on the floor. They cut Rembrandt's The Storm on the Sea of Galilee out of the frame, as well as A Lady and Gentleman in Black. [...] They also removed Vermeer's The Concert and Govaert Flinck's Landscape with an Obelisk from their frames. Additionally, they also took a Chinese bronze gu from the Shang Dynasty.|$|E

500|$|Three {{months after}} Hemingway was {{released}} from the Mayo Clinic, when he was back in Ketchum in April 1961, Mary [...] "found Hemingway holding a shotgun" [...] in the kitchen one morning. She called Saviers, who sedated him and admitted him to the Sun Valley Hospital; from there he was returned to the Mayo Clinic for more electroshock treatments. He was released in late June and arrived home in Ketchum on June 30. Two days later, {{in the early morning hours}} of July 2, 1961, Hemingway [...] "quite deliberately" [...] shot himself with his favorite shotgun. He had unlocked the basement storeroom where his guns were kept, gone <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front entrance foyer of their Ketchum home, and according to Mellow, shot himself with the [...] "double-barreled shotgun that he had used so often it might have been a friend".|$|E
2500|$|In 1888, Soapy {{opened the}} Tivoli Club, on the {{southeast}} corner of Market and 17th Streets, a combination saloon and gambling house. Legend has it that above the entrance of the stairway leading <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gambling games was a sign that read caveat emptor, Latin for [...] "let the buyer beware". Soapy's younger brother, Bascomb Smith, joined the gang and operated a cigar store that was a front for dishonest poker games and other swindles, operating in one of the back rooms. Other operations included fraudulent lottery shops, a [...] "sure-thing" [...] stock exchange, fake watch and bogus diamond auctions, and the sale of stocks in nonexistent businesses.|$|E
2500|$|Within a few years, Rumble {{had carved}} out a sizable {{territory}} and was promoting shows throughout New England. While Rumble had already been a highly recognizable personality from his years in IWCCW, he also started a Public-access television show, Mass Madness, produced by Pat Doyle. The series had fairly high quality production and featured not only televised wrestling events but also comedic [...] "wrap-around segments". One of these segments, [...] "Tony Rumble’s Mike Lano Chronicles", featured a continuing series of matches and skits of a wrestler impersonating wrestling [...] "dirt sheet" [...] writer Dr. Mike Lano. He was a self-claimed NWA World Heavyweight Champion but that his belt [...] "was upstairs in the penthouse getting buffed by the Lano-ettes". The skits followed Lano as he attempted to convince Jim Cornette to become his manager. When Lano finally tracks down Cornette, who is seen stealing crackers from a hotel kitchen, he is challenged to a wrestling trivia duel. Following this, the skit ends with Lano going <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> penthouse where he is attacked by Mae Young and the Fabulous Moolah.|$|E

50|$|Architecturally, fire {{stations}} vary in age {{and design}} from Edwardian era red-brick fire houses to modern spacious blocks complete with additional specialist facilities.

2500|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of Terminal 3, Terminal 1 was the main {{terminal}} building at Ben Gurion Airport. At that time, the departures check-in area was located on the ground floor. From there, passengers proceeded <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main departures hall, which contained passport control, duty-free shops, VIP lounges, one synagogue and boarding gates. At the gates, travelers would be required to descend a flight of stairs to return to the ground floor where waiting shuttle buses transported them to airplanes on the tarmac. The arrivals hall with passport control, luggage carousels, duty-free pick-up and customs was located {{at the south end of}} the building. The shuttle-buses transferred passengers and crews to and from the terminal to airplanes which were parked on the tarmac over [...] away. After Terminal 3 opened, Terminal 1 was closed except for domestic flights to the airport in Eilat and government flights such as special immigrant flights from North America and Africa. Chartered flights organised by Nefesh B'Nefesh carrying immigrants from North America and England use this terminal for their landing ceremonies several times a year.|$|E
2500|$|That same Wednesday 24 July 1974 at 3:30 pm, {{outside the}} Social Services office in Shaftesbury Square, Ogilby and her {{daughter}} were kidnapped by 25-year-old UDA man Albert [...] "Bumper" [...] Graham, while members of Elizabeth Douglas' [...] "Heavy Squad" [...] waited at the nearby Regency Hotel lounge bar overlooking the office. They knew beforehand that Ogilby had an appointment that afternoon at the Shaftesbury Square office. Using the pretext that a UDA commander wished to speak with her, Graham was able to abduct Ogilby {{and her daughter}} Sharlene {{as they left the}} office; Ogilby, taken in by Graham's words, willingly got into his blue minibus. [...] Having made a pre-arranged signal to the watching women, Graham drove the two females away to the UDA club in Hunter Street, Sandy Row, which had been turned into a [...] "romper room". When the UDA women, led by Douglas, arrived on the scene, Ogilby tried to escape, but was grabbed and forcibly detained. After Graham sent Sharlene to a corner shop to buy sweets, Ogilby was ordered by Douglas to be dragged inside the former bakery and forced <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first floor where she was made to sit on a wooden bench, blindfolded and a hood placed over her head. By this stage, Ogilby was so intimidated and terrorised by the [...] "Heavy Squad", she no longer put up any resistance. Sunday Life newspaper suggested that she was bound to a chair instead of a bench. Ciarán Barnes, a journalist writing for the paper, had conducted an interview with Sharlene Ogilby in 2010. Retired RUC detective, Alan Simpson, who devoted a chapter to the Ann Ogilby murder in his 1999 book Murder Madness: True Crimes of The Troubles, instead affirmed that Ogilby was forced by her captors to sit on a wooden bench. Although hooded and blindfolded, her hands remained untied.|$|E
2500|$|The Sandy Row women's UDA {{unit was}} disbanded after it {{carried out a}} vicious [...] "romper room" [...] {{punishment}} beating on 24 July 1974 which left 32-year-old Ann Ogilby dead. The body of Ogilby, a Protestant single mother who {{had an affair with}} the husband of one of the unit's members, was found in a ditch five days later. The day of the fatal beating Ogilby was abducted and forced <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first floor of a disused bakery in Sandy Row that had been converted into a UDA club. Two teenage girls, Henrietta Cowan and Christine Smith, acting under Elizabeth Douglas' orders to give Ogilby a [...] "good rompering", punched, kicked, then battered her to death with bricks and sticks; the autopsy later revealed that Ogilby had suffered 24 blows to the head and body. The killing, which was carried out within earshot of Ogilby's six-year-old daughter, caused widespread revulsion throughout Northern Ireland and was condemned by the UDA prisoners serving inside the Maze Prison. None of the other UDA women's units had consented to or been aware of the fatal punishment beating until it was reported in the news. Douglas, Cowan, and Smith were convicted of the murder and sentenced to imprisonment at Armagh Women's Jail. Seven other members of the women's unit and a UDA man were also convicted for their part in the murder. The UDA [...] "romper rooms", named after the children's television programme, were places where victims were beaten and tortured prior to being killed. This was known as a [...] "rompering". The [...] "romper rooms" [...] were normally located in disused buildings, lock-up garages, warehouses, and rooms above pubs and drinking clubs. The use of the [...] "romper rooms" [...] was a more common practice among male members of the UDA than their female counterparts.|$|E
