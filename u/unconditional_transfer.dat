40|$|Intergovernmental {{transfers}} can {{be either}} conditional or unconditional {{with regard to the}} autonomy of local governments in spending such financial means. Although fiscal decentralisation has recently been quite pronounced in Eastern European transition countries, the dominance of a purpose- and project-oriented, down-flow transfer system is apparent. In the context of unification, the west German municipal resource allocation system was also implemented {{in the eastern part of}} the country, which provides primarily <b>unconditional</b> <b>transfers</b> for local governments. Furthermore, in the case of adopting the principle of parallel development of fiscal capacity between the state and municipalities, as Saxony already has done, the intergovernmental transfer ratio is no longer exogenously but endogenously determined, which better guarantees a just resource allocation between the two jurisdictions. Since the subsidiarity principle backed by sufficient own fiscal resources and <b>unconditional</b> <b>transfers</b> appears to gain significance in providing local utilities, this study shows the recent Saxon experience with the <b>unconditional</b> <b>transfers,</b> which can be considered for the future fiscal devolution process of Eastern European transition countries. intergovernmental transfers, fiscal decentralisation, local expenditure needs, municipal tax revenues, vertical fiscal equalisation, Saxony, Germany, European transition economies...|$|R

In an experimental setting, this paper addresses institutional arrangements between subjects who can provide a public good (insiders) and subjects who benefit from the public good but cannot provide it (outsiders). We compare a setting of passive outsiders to situations where outsiders can either make <b>unconditional</b> <b>transfers</b> (donations) or conditional transfers (contracts) to the insiders. The primary behavioral question is to what extent outsiders will respond to the opportunity to subsidize the contributions of insiders and will insiders use such subsidies to increase contributions or simply substitute them for their own contributions. The results suggest the latter. In fact, once conditional or <b>unconditional</b> <b>transfers</b> are allowed, insiders decrease contributions to the public good relative to the baseline condition without transfers...|$|R

50|$|The year 1920 revived a {{discussion}} {{that had gone}} on for years without resolution of the issues involved. Repeatedly, the view had been expressed that the Medical College of Virginia and the University of Virginia Department of Medicine might well be consolidated with benefit both to theschools and to the public. In 1867, 1905, and 1913 the question emerged, and, finally, in 1920 a really serious study was undertaken. In reviewing appropriations. Governor Westmoreland Davis noted that Virginia was supporting two medical schools, seemingly in competition and surmised thatthis might well be uneconomic, particularly {{at a time when}} money was tight. Acting on the Governor's recommendation, the General Assembly authorized a Commission on Medical Education. The Commission made a thorough study. It recommended that Virginia support only one medical school, that this school be in Richmond, and that it be the Department of Medicine of the University of Virginia under the full and sole control of the Rector and Visitors of the University, and, finally, that the plan be effective upon the <b>unconditional</b> <b>transfer</b> of all Medical College of Virginia properties and assets to the Rector and Visitors of the University. The Board of Visitors of the Medical College of Virginia was in favor and by resolution determined that the College would willingly embrace the plan should the Commission's recommendations be accepted by the Legislature. Instead, the alumni of the University under the leadership of the eminent Dr. Hugh Young of Johns Hopkins Medical School waged a mighty campaign to preserve the medical school in status quo at Charlottesville. The report was approved overwhelmingly in the House, but died by a 24-16 tally in the Senate. In view of the state's growth, the action of the Senate was most fortunate. Had the report won approval, Virginia would have found herself today facing the organization of another medical school with a minimum price tag of 30 million dollars. The issue was to rise again in 1947, but only briefly, as the handwriting on the wall was by that time quite clear.|$|E

It has been an open question whether programmed grammars with contextfree core rules using <b>unconditional</b> <b>transfer</b> characterize the recursively enumerable languages or not.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the implications of}} political factors for social policy choices. Specifically, we explore the link between regime type and adoption of <b>unconditional</b> <b>transfers</b> versus transfers conditioned on beneficiaries’ investments in human capital. Due to the direct nature of benefits, <b>unconditional</b> <b>transfers</b> {{are more likely to}} be used to buy off opposition and prevent social unrest. As transfers that are conditioned on education and health pay off only in a relatively distant future, they are rarely initiated for political motives and rather defined by interests of long-term development and human capital accumulation. Using the new dataset on Non-Contributory Social Transfer Programs (NSTP) in developing countries, we find that transfers are indeed chosen so as to be unconditional under less democratic regimes. There is some evidence that conditional transfers {{are more likely to be}} adopted in democracies. In particular, democracies tend to increase the number of conditional schemes once any social transfer program is introduced...|$|R
40|$|Service {{standards}} {{in the provision of}} health and education in the states in India are low on average and also characterized by large inter-state disparities. These disparities are due to differences in fiscal capacity, differences in revenue effort and differences in priority accorded to the concerned sectors. The transfers from the central to state governments in many federations are guided by the equalization principle. Two important examples are Canada and Australia. When <b>unconditional</b> <b>transfers</b> are made, equalization transfers aim to neutralize deficiency in fiscal capacity but not that in revenue effort. Sometimes adjustments affecting cost and need factors may also be accommodated. Both in Canada and Australia, apart from general purpose and <b>unconditional</b> <b>transfers,</b> there are also specific purpose transfers.

At the same time, conditional and <b>unconditional</b> cash <b>transfers</b> accompanied by rigorous impact evaluations have been conducted in low- and middle-income countries with the explicit support of the World Bank. Both Basic Income and cash transfer programs are more confidently designed when based on empirical evidence and social theory that explain how and why cash transfers to citizens are effective ways of encouraging investment in human capital through health and education spending. Are conditional cash transfers more effective and/or more efficient than <b>unconditional</b> <b>transfers?</b> Are means-tested transfers effective? This essay draws explicit parallels between Basic Income and <b>unconditional</b> cash <b>transfers,</b> and demonstrates that cash transfers to citizens work in remarkably similar ways in low-, middle- and high-income countries. It addresses the theoretical foundation of cash transfers. Of the four theories discussed, three explicitly acknowledge the interdependence of society and are based, in increasingly complex ways, on ideas of social inclusion.
