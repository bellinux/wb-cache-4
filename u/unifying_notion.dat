This paper draws on research on fifteen deep narratives that we collected to uncover detailed accounts of relationships between each participant and a single particular loved artifact or collection of a single type. Three themes emerged from our analysis of the narratives: (i) intimacy accumulated as an association with an object over time, (ii) investment of effort to learn and control functionality, and (iii) implicit values related to the patterns of collection of artifacts. In conceptualizing these three themes as an analytical frame, we arrived at two <b>unifying</b> <b>notions</b> that generally apply across many of the narratives and that serve as catalysts to design principles, namely the notion of rarity of an object, and the notion of aficionado-appeal of an object. We conclude by considering how these <b>unifying</b> <b>notions</b> can be used reflectively and judiciously to prompt design principles for interaction designers at least, and possibly as design principles in-and-of-themselves...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: When evolving, a discrete-event system (DES) {{generates a}} {{sequence}} of observable labels, namely a trace. If the DES is large and distributed, what is perceived is a degradation of the trace, namely an uncertain temporal observation. While trace-degradation has never been subject of formal investigation, considerable effort has been spent on similarity-based diagnosis, where temporal observations are checked for subsumption, a property that enables reuse in model-based diagnosis of DESs. A sufficient condition for subsumption was proposed, called coverage. What spurred the results {{presented in this paper}} was the suspicion that coverage and degradation are somewhat related concepts. To prove the validity of this conjecture, the <b>unifying</b> <b>notion</b> of relaxation between temporal observations is presented. Despite their different definitions, both degradation and coverage are shown to be instances of relaxation. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} {{and study}} a tactic language, Hitac, for constructing hierarchical proofs, known as hiproofs. The idea of hiproofs is to superimpose a labelled hierarchical nesting on an ordinary proof tree. The labels and nesting {{are used to}} describe the organisation of the proof, typically relating to its construction process. This can be useful for understanding and navigating the proof. Tactics in our language construct hiproof structure together with an underlying proof tree. We provide both a big-step and a small-step operational semantics for evaluating tactic expressions. The big-step semantics captures the intended meaning, whereas the small-step semantics hints at possible implementations and provides a <b>unified</b> <b>notion</b> of proof state. We prove that these notions are equivalent and construct valid proofs. ...|$|R
