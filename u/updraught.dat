25|$|The Rumford {{fireplace}} {{created a}} sensation in 1796 when Benjamin Thompson Rumford introduced {{the idea of}} restricting the chimney opening to increase the <b>updraught.</b> Rumford fireplaces were common from 1796, when Benjamin Rumford first wrote about them, until about 1850. Thomas Jefferson had them built at Monticello, and Henry David Thoreau listed them among the modern conveniences that everyone took for granted. Rumford and his workers changed fireplaces by inserting bricks into the hearth to make the side walls angled and added a choke to the chimney {{to increase the speed}} of air going up the flue. It produced a streamlined air flow, reducing turbulence so the smoke would go up into the chimney rather than choking the residents. Rumford fireplaces are appreciated for their tall classic elegance and heating efficiency. This simple alteration in the design of fireplaces were copied everywhere in an age when fires were the principal source of heat. The Rumford fireplace is still used in the 21st century.|$|E

5000|$|As {{a result}} of a faulty generalisation, it is very often {{incorrectly}} said that cumulonimbus and the <b>updraughts</b> under them are always turbulent. This fallacy originates from the fact that cumulonimbus are actually extremely turbulent at high altitude, and therefore, one might falsely deduce that cumulonimbus are turbulent at all altitudes. Reliable studies and glider pilots' experience have demonstrated that <b>updraughts</b> under cumulonimbus were generally smooth. As seen above, <b>updraughts</b> under a cumulonimbus are often dynamic and thus will be very smooth. The phenomenon is enhanced under the weak echo region of a supercell thunderstorm that is extremely dangerous. However, this phenomenon is little known in the aviation world. Thus, a widespread view in the aeronautical community is that cumulonimbus are always associated with very strong turbulence (at all altitudes) and severe thunderstorms.

2500|$|The two XP-51Bs were a more {{thorough}} conversion than the Mustang X, with a tailor-made engine installation and a complete redesign of the radiator duct. The airframe itself was strengthened, with the fuselage and engine mount area receiving more formers because of the [...] greater weight of the Packard V-1650-3 compared with the V-1710.

The new engine drove a four-bladed -diameter Hamilton Standard propeller that featured cuffs of hard molded rubber. To cater for the increased cooling requirements of the Merlin, a new fuselage duct was designed. This housed a larger radiator, which incorporated a section for the supercharger coolant, and, forward of this and slightly lower, an oil cooler was housed in a secondary duct which drew air through the main opening and exhausted via a separate exit flap.|$|E

Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal units needed to raise 1 pound of water from 50 degrees to 212 degrees Fahrenheit.|$|E

5000|$|A glider pilot {{convinced}} that cumulonimbus are always violent risks getting a nasty surprise. If he flies under the flanking {{line of a}} supercell thunderstorm and finds that the air is very smooth and <b>updraughts</b> are moderate, he may falsely infer that he is safe and not under a cumulonimbus; since cumulonimbus are, officially, always turbulent. He may thus not realise when he is under a secondary cumulonimbus that can suck him inside the cloud, and he may encounter a wall cloud that could generate a tornado that could disentegrate his fragile skiff as shown in Figure 5.

5000|$|The above {{quotation}} puts informally the harbingers of a thunderstorm. So a cumulonimbus acts as {{an enormous}} thermal machine that sucks up {{the air in the}} front (left side of Figure 3) and violently throws it out in the back through downbursts (right side of Figure 3). Consequently, a broad area of <b>updraughts</b> will be located in front of the thunderstorm. Typically, in a humid airmass, the <b>updraughts</b> will be on the order of 1 m/s; and in a dry air mass, they will be on the order of 2 to 3 m/s. Therefore, when a glider pilot is in an area where [...] "updraughts are everywhere" [...] and he is close to large clouds (that can be cumulus congestus), he is likely in the vicinity of a building thunderstorm.|$|R

50|$|Moreover, the diameters of the <b>updraught</b> columns vary between 2 km (air mass thunderstorm) and 10 km (supercell thunderstorm). The {{height of}} the {{cumulonimbus}} base is extremely variable. It varies from a few tens of metres above the ground to 4000 m above the ground. In the latter case, the updraughts can originate either from the ground (if the air is very dry - typical of deserts) or from aloft (when altocumulus castellanus degenerates into cumulonimbus). When the <b>updraught</b> originates from aloft, this is considered elevated convection.|$|E
50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, a climb {{inside a}} cumulonimbus can be initially very smooth (due {{to the negative}} buoyancy of the air parcel) and suddenly become horribly turbulent.

40|$|Mechanisms {{through which}} {{atmospheric}} aerosols affect cloud microphysics, dynamics and precipitation are investigated using a spectral microphysics two-dimensional cloud model. A {{significant effect of}} aerosols on cloud microphysics and dynamics has been found. Maritime aerosols lead to a rapid formation of raindrops that fall down through cloud <b>updraughts</b> increasing the loading in {{the lower part of}} a cloud. This is, supposedly, {{one of the reasons for}} comparatively low <b>updraughts</b> in maritime convective clouds. An increase in the concentration of small cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) leads to the formation of a large number of small droplets with a low collision rate, resulting in a time delay of raindrop formation. Such a delay prevents a decrease in the vertical velocity caused by the falling raindrops and thus increases the duration of the diffusion droplet growth stage, increasing latent heat release by condensation. The additional water that rises to the freezing level increases latent heat release by freezing. As a result, clouds developing in continental-type aerosol tend to have larger vertical velocities and to attain higher levels. The results show that a decrease in precipitation efficiency of single cumulus clouds arising in micro-physically continental air is attributable to a greater loss of the precipitating mass due to a greater sublimation of ice and evaporation of drops while they are falling from higher levels through a deep layer of dry air outside cloud <b>updraughts.</b> By affecting precipitation, atmospheric aerosols influence the net heating of the atmosphere...|$|R
50|$|Hail can shred a {{sailplane}} canopy {{and seriously}} damage {{the wings and}} fuselage. Hail is barely visible and can be encountered in the <b>updraught</b> zone under the cloud. On August 5, 1977, an airplane pilot was taken by surprise {{in the vicinity of}} Colorado Springs by a supercell thunderstorm that produced 20 tornadoes. The pilot was flying in eerily calm air (the <b>updraught</b> zone can be laminar) when he saw the sky transitioning from pale grey to inky black. The pilot heard a loud sound that reoccurred more and more frequently. Then a hailstone pierced the windshield, rendering the pilot semi-unconscious. Eventually, the pilot landed his shredded airplane in a field.|$|E
50|$|Figure 3.22 {{from this}} {{reference}} shows {{the presence of}} a rotor outside a downburst. A more-than-foolhardy pilot could easily locate this <b>updraught</b> and exploit it.

Moreover, if for any reason the pilot must land (hail storm or other), he will have to cross the downburst immediately above him {{and there will be a}} greatly increased chance of crashing - due to the unpredictable decrease of the airspeed. Moreover, if the glider transitions from the <b>updraught</b> to the downdraught, severe turbulence will occur due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the shear area. However, pilots have nonetheless exploited such updraughts.|$|E

40|$|Turbulence in the {{convective}} {{boundary layer}} (CBL) uniformly heated from below and {{topped by a}} layer of uniformly stratified fluid is investigated for zero mean horizontal flow using large-eddy simulations (LES). The Rayleigh number is effectively infinite, the Froude number of the stable layer is 0. 09 and the surface roughness height relative to {{the height of the}} convective layer is varied between 10 - 6 and 10 - 2. The LES uses a finite-difference method to integrate the three-dimensional grid-volume-averaged Navier–Stokes equations for a Boussinesq fluid. Subgrid-scale (SGS) fluxes are determined from algebraically approximated second-order closure (SOC) transport equations for which all essential coefficients are determined from the inertial-range theory. The surface boundary condition uses the Monin–Obukhov relationships. A radiation boundary condition {{at the top of the}} computational domain prevents spurious reflections of gravity waves. The simulation uses 160 × 160 × 48 grid cells. In the asymptotic state, the results in terms of vertical mean profiles of turbulence statistics generally agree very well with results available from laboratory and atmospheric field experiments. We found less agreement with respect to horizontal velocity fluctuations, pressure fluctuations and dissipation rates, which previous investigations tend to overestimate. Horizontal spectra exhibit an inertial subrange. The entrainment heat flux at the top of the CBL is carried by cold <b>updraughts</b> and warm downdraughts in the form of wisps at scales comparable with the height of the boundary layer. Plots of instantaneous flow fields show a spoke pattern in the lower quarter of the CBL which feeds large-scale <b>updraughts</b> penetrating into the stable layer aloft. The spoke pattern has also been found in a few previous investigations. Small-scale plumes near the surface and remote from strong <b>updraughts</b> do not merge together but decay while rising through large-scale downdraughts. The structure of <b>updraughts</b> and downdraughts is identified by three-dimensional correlation functions and conditionally averaged fields. The mean circulation extends vertically over the whole boundary layer. We find that <b>updraughts</b> are composed of quasi-steady large-scale plumes together with transient rising thermals which grow in size by lateral entrainment. The skewness of the vertical velocity fluctuations is generally positive but becomes negative in the lowest mesh cells when the dissipation rate exceeds the production rate due to buoyancy near the surface, as is the case for very rough surfaces. The LES results are used to determine the root-mean-square value of the surface friction velocity and the mean temperature difference between the surface and the mixed layer as a function of the roughness height. The results corroborate a simple model of the heat transfer in the surface layer...|$|R
50|$|So {{when the}} pilot {{encounters}} benign cumulonimbus, {{it may be}} a better choice to stay aloft and use the <b>updraughts</b> under the cumulus in front of the thunderstorm along the flanking line (or even under the cumulonimbus itself in its laminar region) and wait for the thunderstorm to dissipate instead of attempting a landing in the presence of possible downbursts.|$|R

Supercell thunderstorms or derechos can have gigantic updraughts at this altitude, updraughts with speeds that can exceed 40 m/s. Such an <b>updraught</b> speed corresponds to the wind speed of a small hurricane. The speed can even exceed 50 m/s. The maximum number in the Beaufort scale is 12 ("hurricane force" [...] wind) and is assigned to wind speeds of 64 knots or greater.

50|$|The US FAA {{recommends}} that aircraft (including gliders) stay at least 20 nautical {{miles away from}} a severe thunderstorm, while a glider pilot could be tempted to use the <b>updraughts</b> below and inside the cloud. There are two sorts of danger {{for this type of}} aircraft. One is related to the shear effects between <b>updraughts</b> and downdraughts inside the cloud - effects that can smash the glider. This shear creates a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability that can generate extremely violent sub-vortices. The second danger is more insidious: the strong <b>updraughts</b> below a supercell cumulonimbus can cover a large area and contain little or no turbulence as explained below. In this case, the glider can be sucked into the cloud, where the pilot can quickly lose visual reference to the ground, causing conditions to quickly become IMC.In these conditions, the aircraft (if not equipped for IMC flight and flown by a pilot experienced in IMC flight) is likely to enter a graveyard spiral and eventually break up by exceeding the wing load limit. In this scenario, the cause of the disintegration of the aircraft is not atmospheric turbulence but is the inability of the pilot to control the aircraft following the loss of visual reference to the ground. In the case of an instrument flight, cumulonimbus can catch a pilot by surprise when embedded in a more benign cloud mass. For example, nimbostratus can originate from the spreading of a cumulonimbus (nimbostratus cumulonimbogenitus), making the presence of active convective cells likely. Small private airplanes are generally not equipped with on-board weather radars; and during an IFR approach, they can be sent accidentally by air traffic control to non-obvious active cells.|$|R
