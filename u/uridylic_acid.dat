Poly I:C inhibited tumor growth by inducing interferon production, but was too toxic to use. In the mid-1970s, William A. Carter, a post-doctoral researcher at Johns Hopkins University, modified the dsRNA molecule by adding <b>uridylic</b> <b>acid</b> molecules at specific intervals along the RNA chain. The new compound, called Ampligen (for AMPLIfied GENetic activity) stimulated interferon production like poly I:C, but with much lower toxicity. It {{is also known as}} [...] "poly I:poly C12U".|$|E
50|$|J. Heinrich Matthaei (born 4 May 1929) is a German biochemist. He is {{best known}} for his unique {{contribution}} to solving the genetic code on 15 May 1961. Whilst a post-doctoral visitor in the laboratory of Marshall Warren Nirenberg at the NIH in Bethesda, Maryland, he discovered that a synthetic RNA polynucleotide, composed of a repeating <b>uridylic</b> <b>acid</b> residue, coded for a polypeptide chain encoding just one kind of amino acid, phenylalanine. In scientific terms, he discovered that polyU codes for polyphenylalanine and hence the coding unit for this amino acid is composed of a series of Us or, as we now know the genetic code is read in triplets, the codon for phenylalanine is UUU. This single experiment opened the way to the solution of the genetic code. It was for this and later work on the genetic code for which Nirenberg shared the Nobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology. In addition, Matthaei and his co-wokers in the following years published a multitude of results concerning the early understanding of the form and function of the genetic code.|$|E
40|$|The pathway of <b>uridylic</b> <b>acid</b> {{biosynthesis}} {{established by}} Leiberman, Kornberg, and Simms {{has been shown}} to be operative in the filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena variabilis. The only enzyme of <b>uridylic</b> <b>acid</b> biosynthesis found to be lacking in two uracil-requiring strains of A. variabilis was aspartate transcarbamylase, the first enzyme in the pathway of de novo biosynthesis of uridvlic acid. Neither uracil-limited growth of a uracil-requiring mutant nor growth of the wild type in high concentrations of uracil resulted in substantial changes in the specific activities of enzymes of <b>uridylic</b> <b>acid</b> biosynthesis. It is therefore concluded that A. variabilis does not regulate all enzymes of this pathway by means of repression. However, control of the flow of intermediates through this pathway is possible by feedback inhibition of aspartate transcarbamylase by a variety of nucleotides...|$|E

In addition {{it was necessary to}} add microgram quantities of a protein concentrate, first obtained from autolysed yeast, but recently by an improved method from dried green peas. Lipids were first extracted from the crude material and the protein was then dis-solved and precipitated with 10 ? $ trichloroacetic acid. This protein was further purified by paper chromatography to yield a concentrate active in dilutions as low as 10 pg. /ml. When the protein was hydrolysed enzymically or by acid or alkali, the hydrolysates were inactive. Sixteen amino acids were qualitatively identified in the hydrolysate.

40|$|A {{strain of}} Penicillium notatum {{has been found}} growing upon media {{containing}} saturated calcium acetate which upon passage through media containing saturated KC 1 loses its ability to grow at normal rates in salt-free glucose-peptone medium. This salt-habituated form can be restored to a near-normal growth rate by adding yeast extract, RNA or RNA-hydrolysates, but not by DNA or its hydrolysate. The 4 RNA nucleotides in combination replace yeast extract whereas riboside and base combinations do not. Adenylic, guanylic or cytidilic acids, singly or in various combinations, are even more effective, but <b>uridylic</b> <b>acid</b> alone is not active at all. Ribonucleotide pairs including <b>uridylic</b> <b>acid</b> are less active, but 3 ribonucleotide combinations are highly effective, even {{in the presence of}} <b>uridylic</b> <b>acid.</b> Differential effects were evident in mycelial form and sporulation, as well as growth.

40|$|The {{metabolism}} of cytidine- 2 - 14 C and uridine- 2 - 14 C was {{studied in}} discs cut from leaflets of bean plants (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Cytidine was degraded to {{carbon dioxide and}} incorporated into RNA {{at about the same}} rates as was uridine. Both nucleosides were converted into the same soluble nucleotides, principally uridine diphosphate glucose, suggesting that cytidine was rapidly deaminated to uridine and then metabolized along the same pathways. However, cytidine was converted to cytidine diphosphate and cytidine triphosphate more effectively than was uridine. Cytidine also was converted into cytidylic acid of RNA much more extensively and into RNA <b>uridylic</b> <b>acid</b> less extensively than was uridine. Azaserine, an antagonist of reactions involving glutamine (including the conversion of uridine triphosphate to cytidine triphosphate), inhibited the conversion of cytidine into RNA <b>uridylic</b> <b>acid</b> with less effect on its incorporation into cytidylic acid. On the other hand, it inhibited the conversion of orotic acid into RNA cytidylic acid much more than into <b>uridylic</b> <b>acid.</b> The results suggest that cytidine is in part metabolized by direct conversion to uridine and in part by conversion to cytidine triphosphate through reactions not involving uridine nucleotides...|$|E

N., Sitz, T. O. and Sommers, K. D. (1980) J. Mol. Biol. 142, 117 - 121). The {{effect of this}} methylation on the 5. 8 S RNA structure and 5. 8 - 28 S rRNA junction was investigated using both chemical and physical approaches. Electrophoretic studies indicated that the free 5. 8 S rRNA can take {{on at least two}} different conformations and that the 2 '-O-methylation at U 14 restricts the molecule to the more hydrodynamically open form. Structural studies using limited pancreatic or T 1 ribonuclease digestion indicated that the methylated conformation was more susceptible to digestion, consistent with a more open tertiary structure. Modification-exclusion studies indicated that the first 29 nucleotides at the 5 ' end and residues 140 through 158 at the 3 ' end affect the 5. 8 S- 28 S rRNA interaction, supporting previous suggestions that the 5. 8 S RNA interacts with its cognate high molecular weight component through its termini. These results also suggested that the 2 '-O-methylated <b>uridylic</b> <b>acid</b> residue plays a role in the 5. 8 S- 28 S rRNA interaction and thermal denaturation studies confirmed this by showing that methylation destabilizes the 5. 8 S- 28 S rRNA junction.

It is difficult, on quantitative grounds, to explain the large modifications of the antigenic determinants by the localization in these determinants of the few amino acid replacements which the observed thiouridylic incorporation might cause. It is hypothesized that the tertiary structure of the polypeptide is responsible for antigenic specificity and that amino acid replacement occurring in any of a number of points of the molecule can alter this tertiary structure. © 1965.

40|$|When 14 C-thymidine labeled only in {{the ring}} is {{administered}} to Neurospora crassa, {{the majority of the}} recovered label is found in the ribonucleic acid (RNA). Three mutants were isolated in which different steps are blocked in the pathway that converts the pyrimidine ring of thymidine to an RNA precursor. Evidence from genetic, nutritional, and accumulation studies with the three mutants shows the pathway to proceed as follows: thymidine -> thymine -> 5 -hydroxymethyluracil -> 5 -formyluracil -> uracil -> <b>uridylic</b> <b>acid.</b> A mutant strain in which the thymidine to thymine conversion is blocked is unable to metabolize thymidine appreciably by any route, including entry into nucleic acids.

Deoxynucleotides of cytosine, thymine, and uracil, and the deoxynucleosides of adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine were inactive as inhibitors. The inhibition was reversed by liver extract (a crude source of two unidentified growth factors for this organism). With suboptimal concentrations of liver extract, the inhibition was reversed by nucleotides of adenine, guanine, uracil, cytosine, and thymine. When the medium contained partially purified sources of the two growth factors rather than crude liver extract, fewer compounds reversed the inhibition. Adenylic acid and guanylic acid reversed the action of either inhibitor. Inosinic acid reversed inhibition caused by deoxyguanylic acid, but not that caused by deoxyadenylic acid. Thymidylic acid reversed inhibition caused by deoxyadenylic acid better than that caused by deoxyguanylic acid. <b>Uridylic</b> <b>acid</b> and cytidylic acid were no longer effective in reversing the inhibitions.

In this study, we provide evidence that {{a small fraction of}} U 6 snRNA and 5 S ribosomal RNA molecules from human as well as Xenopus oocytes contain a single posttranscriptionally added adenylic acid residue on their 3 ' ends. These data show that U 6 snRNA and 5 S rRNAs are posttranscriptionally modified on their 3 ' ends by both uridylation and adenylation. Although the SRP RNA, 7 SK RNA, 5 S RNA, and U 6 snRNA with the <b>uridylic</b> <b>acid</b> residue on their 3 ' ends were readily uridylated, all these RNAs with posttranscriptionally added adenylic acid residue on their 3 ' ends were not uridylated in vitro, or when U 6 snRNA with 3 ' A(OH) was injected into Xenopus oocytes. These results show that the presence of a single posttranscriptionally added adenylic acid residue on the 3 ' end of SRP RNA, U 6 snRNA, 5 S rRNA, or 7 SK RNA prevents 3 ' uridylation. These data also show that adenylation and uridylation are two competing processes that add nucleotides on the 3 ' end of some small RNAs and suggest that one of the functions of the 3 ' adenylation may be to negatively affect the 3 ' uridylation of small RNAs...|$|E
40|$|To {{characterize}} the transcriptional organization and regulation of minute virus of mice, an autonomous parvovirus, viral transcriptional complexes were isolated and cleaved with restriction enzymes. The in vivo preinitiated nascent RNA was elongated in vitro {{in the presence}} of [alpha- 32 P]UTP to generate runoff transcripts. The lengths of the runoff transcripts were analyzed by gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. On the basis of the map locations of the restriction sites and the lengths of the runoff transcripts, the in vivo initiation sites were determined. Two major initiation sites having similar activities were thus identified at residues 201 +/- 5 and 2005 +/- 5; both of them were preceded by a TATAA sequence. When uncleaved viral transcriptional complexes or isolated nuclei were incubated in vitro {{in the presence of}} [alpha- 32 P]UTP or [alpha- 32 P]CTP, they synthesized labeled RNA that, as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, contained a major band of 142 nucleotides. The RNA of the major band was mapped between the initiation site at residue 201 +/- 5 and residue 342. We noticed the potential of forming two mutually exclusive stem-and-loop structures in the 142 -nucleotide RNA; one of them is followed by a string of <b>uridylic</b> <b>acid</b> residues typical of a procaryotic transcription termination signal. We propose that, as in the transcription of simian virus 40, RNA transcription in minute virus of mice may be regulated by attenuation and may involve eucaryotic polymerase B, which can respond to a transcription termination signal {{similar to that of the}} procaryotic polymerase...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthetic}} polyribonucleotides {{adenylic acid}} (poly A), <b>uridylic</b> <b>acid</b> (poly U), cytidylic acid (poly C), and inosinic acid (poly I), whether single- or double-stranded (poly A:U, poly I:C), cannot replace mycobacterial ribonucleic acid (RNA) {{in the production}} of a high immune response in CF- 1 mice against tuberculous disease. These conclusions are {{based on the results of}} several types of experiments. (i) Poly A and poly U, used either singly or in combination, did not increase the immunogenicity of mycobacterial RNA preparations whether emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant (FIA) or not emulsified. (ii) Mycobacterial ribosomal protein, extracted with 2 -chloroethanol, was not immunogenic; the addition of poly A:U to the protein did not produce an immune response and FIA did not affect these results. (iii) The RNA left after the protein was extracted was partially immunogenic when emulsified in FIA even though it was partially degraded. (iv) Mycobacterial RNA prepared with ethyl alcohol and partially degraded with ribonuclease had a significantly lower immunogenic activity, and the original higher immune response was not restored by the addition of poly A:U. (v) Mycobacterial RNA totally degraded by weak alkali was not immunogenic, the original immunogenic activity was not restored by the addition of poly A:U or poly I:C, and FIA again did not influence the results. These findings suggest that (i) protein, polypeptides, or other antigenic fragments, if present, are not the specific immunogens; and (ii) mycobacterial RNA is responsible for the high immunogenic activity of mycobacterial ribosomal and RNA preparations. In addition, since the double-stranded forms of these synthetic polynucleotides markedly potentiate the formation of circulating antibodies, these results also reemphasize the lack of correlation between conventional antibody formation and immunity against tuberculosis...|$|E
40|$|The 5 ' non-coding {{region of}} the genomes of 11 {{isolates}} of Murray Valley encephalitis virus from Australia and Papua New Guinea were examined by primer extension sequencing. Although the 5 ' non-coding region of all isolates {{was found to be}} highly conserved, three isolates were significantly different in that they contained extra uridine residues. Two of these isolates from Papua New Guinea contained an extra uridine residue, nominally positioned after nucleotide 54, which was absent from {{all but one of the}} Australian isolates tested. This isolate (OR 156) contained a further uridine residue at the same site. These results provide further support for earlier observations on the genetic relationships between these isolates, in particular that OR 156 is more closely related to the Papua New Guinea strains than to the Australian strains. The genome of flaviviruses consists of one segment of single-stranded positive-sense RNA with an Mr of about 4 x 10 6. The genome terminates at the 5 ' end with a type 1 cap (Cleaves & Dubin, 1979) and with <b>uridylic</b> <b>acid</b> at the 3 ' end (Rice et al., 1985; Brinton et al., 1986). Genomic RNA is organized into a small non-coding region (approximately 100 nucleotides) at the 5 ' terminus, followed by a single open reading frame (about 10 - 3 kb) which encodes the structural and non-structural proteins. The 3 ' side of this open reading frame is flanked by another non-coding region of about 600 nucleotides. Brinton & Dispoto (1988) demonstrated extensive sequence and secondary structure conservation of the 5 ' non-coding region of seven isolates of Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLE) and two isolates of West Nile virus (WN). In addition, they compared the published Y-terminal sequence for five other flaviviruses and again found a high degree of conservation of secondary structure. In this paper the 5 ' region of 11 isolates of Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVE) was examined by determining the primary sequence. The sequence of MVE was compared with those of other flaviviruses, including two recently sequenced flaviviruses, Japanes...|$|E
