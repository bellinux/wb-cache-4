A computer-assisted telephone survey of 2402 adults (aged ≥ 18 years) was conducted to determine walking behaviour and perceptions of neighbourhood walkability.

Compared to <b>urban</b> <b>areas,</b> rural areas had lower walkability scores and urban residents reported higher frequency of walking. The association of perceived walkability with walking was significant only in <b>urban</b> <b>areas.</b> These results suggest that environmental factors associated with walking in <b>urban</b> <b>areas</b> may not be relevant in rural areas.

MethodsWe analysed the case investigation reports of scrub typhus cases that were collected in Korea in 2009. Specially, the different risk factors such as fieldwork and outdoor activity were compared to <b>urban</b> and rural <b>areas,</b> and six <b>urban</b> cities. Statistical analysis was performed using χ 2 test. ResultsA total of 4, 461 cases (including 1, 663 suspected cases) were analysed in this study. Among these, the case reports of 4, 254 cases had complete addresses. The cases with outdoor activities were 720 (85. 2 %) in <b>urban</b> <b>areas.</b> In Daegu and Daejeon, {{the number of cases}} participated in outdoor activities was 32 (34. 4 %) and 23 (31. 5 %), respectively.
