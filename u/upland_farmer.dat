Research was conducted in Bukidnon province to compare the potential returns from trees and annual crops, and determine whether the typical farm forestry practice of intercropping trees and crops conferred efficiencies that could make it competitive with larger scale plantation projects. A bioeconomic model was developed from the research. The paper suggests that farm forestry is economically efficient, environmentally advantageous, and socially empowering, and that policy should be pursued to facilitate its expansion by providing information such as best management practices and by removing disincentives to tree planting such as harvesting restrictions and tenure insecurity. It also suggests that forestry investment should be directed at protecting and enhancing the nonmarket benefits of complex forests. bioeconomy, upland farming, tree planting, farm forestry...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Soil {{nutrient}} loss due to soil erosion and removal in harvest with traditional farming methods where farmers {{do not use}} any fertilisers threatens the sustainability of vegetable productions in the Philippine <b>uplands.</b> Consequently, poor <b>farmers</b> are losing incomes due to declining yields. The situation is reaching crisis point. A bio-economic analysis is used in this research to investigate the economic returns in terms of gross and net annual income over time for <b>upland</b> <b>farmers</b> from adopting alternative soil management options. Cost benefit analysis is {{used to compare the}} net returns to farmers from potential management options. A bio-physical model, SCUAF, is used to simulate the long-run tomato yields and associated soil erosion, over a seven-year period, for different soil management options which are both income enhancing and soil nutrient preserving. Data obtained through experiments and surveys of <b>upland</b> <b>farmers</b> in Claveria in the Philippines island of Mindanao, are used to derive yearly production budget for tomato farming on one hectare of land. The analyses reveal that significantly higher economic returns are achievable a combination of organic and inorganic fertiliser additions. This combination seems to be most attractive since it leads to benefits in both yield increase and reduced soil erosion over time. Therefore, concentrating further research on the use of fertiliser combinations, especially at lower rates where marginal returns are highest seems to be an appropriate focus, and one which is most likely to be adopted by farmers.

To persuade the <b>upland</b> <b>farmers</b> to adopt sustainable practices, it is vital first to assess their perception of sustainable agriculture. This study aimed to measure banana farmers’ perception towards sustainable agriculture and its determinants in the Vietnam uplands based on a case study in Quang Tri province. Stratified sample technique was used to randomly select 300 respondents from 2 upland districts of Quang Tri. The primary data were gathered by using a structured questionnaire with Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0. 84. The results showed that the majority (84. 7 %) of the farmers had low to mode rate perceptions of sustainable agriculture. Farmers had positive perceptions towards sustainable agriculture in issues related to protection of agricultural resources, negative effects of agrochemicals on human health and the environment, input application, crop rotation, product consumption and roles of farmer groups; whereas, they had moderate perceptions about issues related to production profits, plant residue use and modern technology application. In addition, the study revealed that agricultural programs on TV, education, ethnic group, economic status and credit use were the factors that affected farmers’ sustainable agriculture perceptions...|$|R

40|$|The {{improvement}} of dairy farming in Japan can best seen {{by looking at}} the increase in the average size of dairy herds and the {{improvement of}} milk yield per cow. These indexes are at the same level of EU countries and approaching those of the USA. This rapid development has resulted in debt accumulation in Hokkaido and raised the environ-mental issue of manure management. The proper processing of dairy farm manure would solve the water pollution problem and provide a source of organic fertilizer for upland farming. To turn this environmental negative into a positive requires the cooperation of dairy and <b>upland</b> <b>farmers</b> and financial incentives from the government. To secure management stability and environmentally friendly dairy farming, a price policy for processed milk and a direct payment system to farmers are necessary. The basic premise of the price policy is that it will allow the level of milk prices to gradually reach that of advanced dairy farming countries without depleting resources, over-loading the environment with cow waste, resorting to low wages, or the need for low land rents. The original intent of the direct payment system was to supplement incomes due to declining milk prices. To improve the system the government must increase the amount of money allocated for payments and make the system more flexible. Direct payments should reward farmers who increase the planted area of forage per cow, because this will decrease the environmental load and reduce water pollution. Moreover, the system should reward <b>upland</b> <b>farmers</b> who prove that they use manure as fertilizer...|$|R

The sample size was 240 rice farmers (120 Agricultural Development Programme (ADP) <b>Upland</b> rice contact <b>farmers</b> and 120 Agricultural Development Programme (ADP) Swamp contact rice farmers). Data for the analysis were collected from a structured questionnaire. The result indicates that mean ages of <b>upland</b> rice <b>farmers</b> was 37. 3 years while swamp rice farmers had 39. 2 years. The mean farming experience for both farmers were 8. 5 years (<b>upland</b> rice <b>farmers)</b> and 8. 8 years (swamp rice farmers) with farm sizes of 1. 2 and 1. 1 hectares for <b>upland</b> rice <b>farmers</b> and swamp rice <b>farmers</b> respectively. <b>Upland</b> rice <b>farmers</b> had an annual farm income of 189, 410. 00 NGN (1, 222 USD) as against 201, 166. 00 NGN (1, 297. 85 USD) for Swamp rice farmers. The multiple regression (Cobb Douglas) estimates of the determinants of output of upland rice showed that coefficients age, farming experience, farm size, variable inputs and farm income were positively signed at given levels of probability while capital inputs was negative. The Cobb Douglas regression estimates of the determinants of output of Swamp rice showed that the coefficients of education, labour cost, farm size, variable inputs and farm income were positively signed and significant at given levels of probability as well as capital inputs which was negative. The result indicates that net profit from Upland rice cultivation was 92, 800. 00 NGN (598. 71 USD) with a Benefit Cost Ratio of N 1. 55 (1. 56 USD).

30|$|In {{the last}} four years, 36 % of <b>upland</b> <b>farmers</b> have reduced or stopped grazing on moorland, which is the highest most {{marginal}} land in the uplands. The most common reasons given were due to environmental schemes (61 %) and the poor financial return of upland livestock (38 %). These figures suggest that farmers have responded significantly to the incentives of environmental schemes to reduce overgrazing on moorland areas, but indicate that wider economic factors have also reduced the business incentive to graze moorland. While the changes in CAP support outlined above are important, consistently weak market prices up to 2007 (Gaskell et al. 2008) may also be relevant. Such reductions may also hinder farm businesses responding when market conditions improve, as they have since 2009.|$|R
