5|$|Some {{palladium}} is emitted {{with the}} exhaust gases of cars with catalytic converters. Between 4 and 108ng/km of palladium particulate is released by such cars, while the total <b>uptake</b> from food {{is estimated to}} be less than 2µg per person a day. The second possible source of palladium is dental restoration, from which the <b>uptake</b> of palladium {{is estimated to be}} less than 15µg per person per day. People working with palladium or its compounds might have a considerably greater <b>uptake.</b> For soluble compounds such as palladium chloride, 99% is eliminated from the body within 3 days.|$|E
50|$|As for the {{graduate}} medical training, although only 50 students were accepted each year initially number of <b>uptakes</b> has been increased gradually over the subsequent years. Since {{the end of}} the year 2000, the University has been accepting around 500 <b>uptakes</b> every year.|$|R

30|$|Interestingly, {{some studies}} are {{focusing}} on the correlation between <b>uptakes</b> of 99 mTc-labeled bone tracers (used for bone scintigraphy) or 18 F-fluoride (18 F-FNa used for positron emission tomography or PET) with 223 Ra <b>uptakes.</b> Pacilio et al. [16] demonstrated a significant correlation between <b>uptakes</b> of 223 Ra and 99 mTc in osteoblastic lesions. Similarly, Murray et al. [31, 36] observed a correlation not only between the <b>uptakes</b> of 223 Ra and 18 F-fluoride in the osteoblastic lesions {{but also with the}} absorbed dose as well. Therefore, {{it might be possible to}} predict the response of treatment in osteoblastic lesions by bone scintigraphy or PET imaging with 18 F-fluoride. Although the <b>uptakes</b> of 223 Ra and 18 F-fluoride at the osteoblastic lesions may be the same, this is not necessarily the case for healthy tissues and elimination routes, suggesting a crucial role for 223 Ra images. Moreover, the correlation between 223 Ra and 99 mTc or 18 F-fluoride in osteolytic lesions is yet to be proved. Finally, some lesions may preferentially bind to 99 mTc-labeled bone tracers or 18 F-FNa rather than 223 Ra [14, 36].|$|R
5|$|The thin {{skin of the}} octopus absorbs {{additional}} oxygen. When resting, around 41% of an octopus's oxygen absorption {{is through}} the skin. This decreases to 33% when it swims, as more water flows over the gills; skin oxygen <b>uptake</b> also increases. When it is resting after a meal, absorption through the skin can drop to 3% of its total oxygen <b>uptake.</b>|$|E
5|$|These bubbles affect gas <b>uptake</b> {{and release}} on {{repetitive}} dives, {{resulting in a}} faster saturation on repetitive dives due {{to a combination of}} redissolved nitrogen from the bubbles, residual dissolved nitrogen, plus the nitrogen <b>uptake</b> due to the repeated exposure.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the thyroid}} {{concentrates}} iodine, it also concentrates the various radioactive isotopes of iodine produced by nuclear fission. In {{the event of}} large accidental releases of such material into the environment, the <b>uptake</b> of radioactive iodine isotopes by the thyroid can, in theory, be blocked by saturating the <b>uptake</b> mechanism with a large surplus of non-radioactive iodine, taken {{in the form of}} potassium iodide tablets. One consequence of the Chernobyl disaster was an increase in thyroid cancers in children in the years following the accident.|$|E
50|$|Into {{the next}} day, the crew battled the blaze that had reflashed and {{continued}} to threaten the entire ship. During the conflagration, an over-temperature alarm sounded for the Mt. 23 CIWS 20 mm ammunition magazine. This necessitated the firecontrolmen offloading the magazine contents over the side because low firemain pressure precluded flooding the magazine to cool it. Mt 23 was situated {{on the port side}} of the island just forward of the boiler <b>uptakes.</b> After the long battle fighting the main space and collateral fires, there were no fatalities. There were however some serious injuries ranging from broken bones to smoke inhalation. Connie pulled back into North Island on 3 August. The subsequent investigation showed that there was a problem with a JP-5 pipe leading to a fuel station that wasn't adequately inspected after an in-port maintenance availability period. The problem was that a pipe that had long ago been removed that used to pass through the <b>uptakes</b> was hooked back up. The 6 to 8 in pipe in the <b>uptakes</b> just emptied into the <b>uptakes</b> where 1MMR's 6 forced draft blowers sucked the fuel into the running boilers. The total amount of JP-5 pumped into the <b>uptakes</b> was approximately 20,000 gallons.|$|R

5|$|Lactate <b>uptake</b> by {{the liver}} is diminished with {{metformin}} administration because lactate is a substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis, {{a process that}} metformin inhibits. In healthy individuals, this slight excess is cleared by other mechanisms (including <b>uptake</b> by unimpaired kidneys), and no significant elevation in blood levels of lactate occurs. Given impaired kidney function, clearance of metformin and lactate is reduced, increasing levels of both, and possibly causing lactic acid buildup. Because metformin decreases liver <b>uptake</b> of lactate, any condition that may precipitate lactic acidosis is a contraindication. Common causes include alcoholism (due to depletion of NAD+ stores), heart failure and respiratory disease (due to inadequate tissue oxygenation); {{the most common cause}} is kidney disease.|$|E

30|$|It {{is a real}} {{deficiency}} that in all {{the papers}} reporting the stunning effect in vivo [1 – 6], except that of Lassmann et al. [7], neither the absorbed doses nor the thyroid remnant <b>uptakes</b> were assessed. Regarding the huge variation in remnant <b>uptakes</b> due to the lesion type, but also due to the hypo- or eu-thyroid status of the patient, doses estimation is required to avoid blurring of the observations {{that could lead to}} misunderstanding of the physical effects.|$|R

5|$|The linear {{component}} is active when the tissue pressure exceeds ambient pressure by a given amount {{specific to the}} tissue compartment. When the tissue pressure drops below this cross-over criterion the tissue is modelled by exponential kinetics. During gas <b>uptake,</b> tissue pressure never exceeds ambient, so it is always modelled by exponential kinetics. This results in a model with the desired asymmetrical characteristics of slower washout than <b>uptake.</b>|$|E
25|$|When DNA <b>uptake</b> and {{subsequent}} expression was first demonstrated in vivo in muscle cells, these cells {{were thought to}} be unique because of their extensive network of T-tubules. Using electron microscopy, it was proposed that DNA <b>uptake</b> was facilitated by caveolae (or, non-clathrin coated pits). However, subsequent research revealed that other cells (such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and epithelial Langerhans cells) could also internalize DNA. The mechanism of DNA <b>uptake</b> is not known.|$|E

40|$|Two {{propylene}} amine oxime (PnAO) complexes, 1 , {{containing a}} 3 -nitro- 1, 2, 4 -triazole and 2 , containing two 3 -nitro- 1, 2, 4 -triazoles, were synthesized and radiolabeled with 99 mTc in high labeling yields. Cellular <b>uptakes</b> of 99 mTc- 1 and 99 mTc- 2 were tested using a S 180 cells line. Under anoxic conditions, the cellular <b>uptakes</b> of 99 mTc- 1 and 99 mTc- 2 were 33. 7 ± 0. 2 % and 35. 0 ± 0. 7 % at 4 h, whereas the normoxic <b>uptakes</b> {{of the two}} complexes were 6. 0 ± 1. 6 % and 4. 6 ± 0. 9 %, respectively. Both 99 mTc- 1 and 99 mTc- 2 displayed significant anoxic/normoxic differentials. The cellular <b>uptakes</b> were highly dependent on oxygen and temperature. Biodistribution studies revealed that both 99 mTc- 1 and 99 mTc- 2 showed a selective localization in tumor and slow clearance from it. At 4 h, the tumor-to-muscle ratios (T/M) were 3. 79 for 99 mTc- 1 and 4. 58 for 99 mTc- 2. These results suggested that 99 mTc-labeled PnAO complexes 99 mTc- 1 and 99 mTc- 2 might serve as novel hypoxia markers. By introducing a second nitrotriazole redox center, the hypoxic accumulation of the marker was slightly enhanced...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{charging}} loads of electric vehicles were controlled to avoid {{their impact on}} distribution networks. A centralized control algorithm was developed using unbalanced optimal power flow calculations with a time resolution of one minute. The charging loads were optimally reallocated using a central controller based on non-linear programming. Electric vehicles were recharged using the proposed control algorithm considering the network constraints of voltage magnitudes, voltage unbalances, and limitations of the network components (transformers and cables). Simulation results showed that network components at the medium voltage level can tolerate high <b>uptakes</b> of uncontrolled recharged electric vehicles. However, at the low voltage level, network components exceeded their limits with these high <b>uptakes</b> of uncontrolled charging loads. Using the proposed centralized control algorithm, these high <b>uptakes</b> of electric vehicles were accommodated in the network under study without the need of upgrading the network components...|$|R

25|$|Tametraline, a {{compound}} synthesized in 1978 by Pfizer, {{was shown to}} be a potent NE and DA re-uptake inhibitor with animal studies. Later on a surprisingly substantial enhancement of blocking activity of 5-HT <b>uptake</b> was achieved by adding chlorine atoms at C-3 and C-4 to the structure of tametraline, resulting in (+)-trans-(1R,4S)-N-methyl-4-phenyl-1-aminotetralin, a potent but nonselective <b>uptake</b> blocker. The (+)-cis-(1S,4S)-isomer, one of four compounds diastereomers, however exhibited significantly more selective and potent 5-HT <b>uptake</b> inhibiting activity compared to the other three diastereomers, where the 4-phenyl ring favours attachments at 5-HT <b>uptake</b> sites. The compound was named sertraline (figure 8). Although sertraline appears to differ structurally from the other SSRIs, it has a phenylaminotetralin in its structure, in which the diphenylpropylamine nucleus has been forced into a stiff bicyclic ring system.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an exptl. study of supercrit. H 2 adsorption in nanoporous carbon plus some supporting data from mol. simulations of adsorption. This is part of a broad examn. of the potential of these materials as storage media for H 2 in sustainable energy systems, in comparison with other proposed storage media such as C nanofibres and metal hydrides, and with other storage systems such cryogenic liq. and high-pressure gas. Note that the new term nanoporous refers to pores in the size range 0. 1 to 100 nm, as proposed in another Mays paper in these Proceedings. Recent results of this work appear to show high H 2 <b>uptakes</b> in nanoporous carbon, but that these <b>uptakes</b> only occur for very pure H. The authors propose a pore blocking mechanism to account for this. While at present high <b>uptakes</b> only appear possible at liq. N temps., the pressures are reasonable...|$|R

25|$|The {{use of a}} {{particular}} 'Iodine tablet' used in portable water purification has also been determined as somewhat effective at reducing radioiodine <b>uptake.</b> In a small study on human subjects, who for each of their 90-day trial, ingested four 20 milligram tetraglycine hydroperiodide(TGHP) water tablets, with each tablet releasing 8 milligrams (ppm) of free titratable iodine; {{it was found that}} the biological <b>uptake</b> of radioactive iodine in these human subjects dropped to, and remained at, a value of less than 2% the radioiodine <b>uptake</b> rate of that observed in control subjects who went fully exposed to radioiodine without treatment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Uptake</b> of {{thiamine}} by {{cells of}} the blood and other tissues occurs via active transport and passive diffusion.

25|$|Carbon-11 choline {{has found}} more success in cancer systems imaging. Choline is a {{precursor}} for {{the synthesis of}} phospholipids in our cells. When a cell is about to divide, it synthesizes these phospholipids to generate enough material to build the cell membranes of the two daughter cells. Thus {{it was hypothesized that}} highly proliferative tumors would <b>uptake</b> more choline than the surrounding healthy tissue. This was first tested in brain tumors after successful demonstration of choline <b>uptake</b> in the brain. It was found that these brain tumors had over 10x the <b>uptake</b> of carbon-11 choline than the surrounding brain tissue. Furthermore, because of the low choline <b>uptake</b> in healthy brain tissue, carbon-11 choline was found to be a superior PET tracer than fluorine-18 Fludeoxyglucose (FDG) when delineating brain tumors. Carbon-11 choline has also been used to detect tumors in the colon and esophagus and lung metastases.|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, Perumal and {{coworkers}} [26] have incorporated {{the influence of}} surface functionalization of dendrimers.

Similarly, Cho et al. [27] have found that gold nanoparticles, coated with negative-charged groups, are poorly adsorbed by negatively charged membranes and consequently, show lower levels of internalization compared with positively charged nanoparticles, which are prone to interact with sialic acid, commonly found in the cell membranes.|$|R
