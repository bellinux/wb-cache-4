25|$|The {{implications}} of people's preference for novelty for human relationships are not straightforward and obvious. Evidence that people desire novelty comes primarily {{from studies of}} people's reactions to art objects and the like. This is different when it concerns human beings and social relationships because people can shift attention away from already familiar novel objects, while doing so in human relationships is difficult or not possible. But novel art objects {{are very different from}} people. If a piece of art becomes overly stimulating, we can simply shift our attention elsewhere. This is not a viable option should our spouse suddenly begin treating <b>us</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> we were someone else, for such treatment would pose serious questions about the integrity of people's belief systems. Consequently, people probably balance competing desires for predictability and novelty by indulging the desire for novelty within contexts in which surprises are not threatening (e.g., leisure activities), while seeking coherence and predictability in contexts in which surprises could be costly—such as in the context of enduring relationships.|$|E
500|$|A {{paramedic}} {{also said}} police allowed the first ambulances that reached Pearl Roundabout to pass safely, while some security personnel captured videos, {{but when the}} ambulances moved out carrying casualties security forces had targeted the vehicles. He said: [...] "Later Bahrain T.V. showed only the scenes where they allowed us to pass in order to mislead the public opinion. I personally heard orders given to security forces via their communication devices to target, threat and delay paramedics {{as long as they}} can. Security forces dealt with <b>us</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> we were defendants and partners to protesters who wanted to hide them, whereas what we were doing was a professional and humane duty {{that has nothing to do}} with our political position." [...] When the block was lifted in the late morning till noon, paramedics did not find any casualties to take back to the SMC at Pearl Roundabout, despite seeing handcuffed protesters being stomped on by police when they arrived.|$|E
500|$|Catt, Stone and Blackwell went {{together}} to the January, 1892 NAWSA convention in Washington, DC. Along with Isabella Beecher Hooker, Stone, Stanton and Anthony, the [...] "triumvirate" [...] of women's suffrage, were called {{away from the}} convention's opening hours by an unexpected woman suffrage hearing before the United States House Committee on the Judiciary. Stone told the assembled congressmen [...] "I come before this committee with the sense which I always feel, that we are handicapped as women in {{what we try to}} do for ourselves by the single fact that we have no vote. This cheapens us. You do not care so much for <b>us</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> we had votes..." [...] Stone argued that men should work to pass laws for equality in property rights between the sexes. Stone demanded an eradication of coverture, the folding of a wife's property into that of her husband. Stone's impromptu speech paled in comparison to Stanton's brilliant outpouring which preceded hers. Stone later published Stanton's speech in its entirety in the Woman's Journal as [...] "Solitude of Self". Back at the NAWSA convention, Anthony was elected president, with Stanton and Stone becoming honorary presidents.|$|E

2500|$|In 2007, Cardinal Rosales {{argued against}} the National Statistics Office (NSO) {{requirement}} that all solemnizing officers/priests undergo training before conducting [...] wedding ceremonies. He said: [...] "We understand {{the concern of}} the National Statistics Office (NSO) because we also know of abuses done by the so-called ministers of the Gospel (not priests), but {{they should not be}} like that to <b>us,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> we know nothing." ...|$|E
2500|$|The French Foreign Ministry {{released}} a statement saying: [...] "France strongly condemns the missile, rocket and mortar attacks against civilians yesterday in southern Israel. In this regard, firing an anti-tank missile at a school bus represents a new escalation. We call for an immediate halt to this violence. France deplores the humanitarian consequences of Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip that came in response, resulting in several civilian casualties. It is urgent to end the escalation {{of violence in the}} Gaza Strip. We call on all the parties to respect a lasting truce. These events remind <b>us,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were necessary, of the urgency of reaching a negotiated resolution to the conflict." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wilson's bandmates {{and father}} Murry resented {{that he was}} singled out as a [...] "genius". A 1971 article by Nolan {{reflected}} that at a certain point, the group's scene was not [...] "happening" [...] anymore, and that Wilson [...] "made it very clear" [...] to then-business partner David Anderle [...] "that it {{was always going to}} be the Beach Boys, that Brian wouldn't do it alone. God knows he could have ... But the Beach Boys ... his family." [...] Mike Love recalls: [...] "As far as I was concerned, Brian was a genius, deserving of that recognition. But the rest of us were seen as nameless components in Brian's music machine ... This frustrated all of us but infuriated [...] Carl ... It didn’t feel to <b>us</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> we were just riding on Brian’s coattails." [...] In a 1966 article that asks [...] "Do the Beach Boys rely too much on sound genius Brian?" [...] Carl rejected the notion, explaining that every member of the group contributes ideas, although Brian was most responsible for their music. Bruce Johnston remembers: [...] "we wanted to be a band again. The whole [...] thing had wiped everyone out, and we wanted to play together again." [...] Dennis Wilson stated: [...] "Brian Wilson is the Beach Boys. He is the band. We're his fucking messengers. He is all of it. Period. We're nothing. He's everything." ...|$|E

60|$|I say, moreover, {{that though}} a seventh day sabbath is not natural to man as man, yet our christian holy day is natural to <b>us</b> <b>as</b> saints, <b>if</b> our consciences are not clogged before with some old fables, or Jewish customs.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't care," [...] {{retorted}} the girl, defiantly. [...] "Why do we endure him--we are {{not dependent}} on him. He treats <b>us</b> precisely <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he owned <b>us,</b> and I'm tired of it. I wish papa would come on and take us home." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. CAROLINE. The Ideal Man! Oh, the Ideal Man {{should talk}} to <b>us</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> we were goddesses, and treat <b>us</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> we were children.

60|$|Jill and I {{had never}} seen Aunt Tommy before, but we took {{to her from the}} start because she was so pretty and because she talked to <b>us</b> just <b>as</b> <b>if</b> we were grown up. She called Jill Elizabeth, and Jill would adore a Hottentot who called her Elizabeth.|$|R

[...] "The country has become more undulating, this afternoon; but the first thirty miles were almost {{perfectly}} level, and I could see nothing, whatever, {{that could serve as}} an index, except of course the sun.
