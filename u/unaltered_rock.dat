60|$|The clay-slate in {{many parts}} of Tierra del Fuego, is broken by dikes and by great masses of greenstone, often highly hornblendic (In a greenstone-dike in the Magdalen Channel, the {{feldspar}} cleaved with the angle of albite. This dike was crossed, as well as the surrounding slate, by a large vein of quartz, a circumstance of unusual occurrence.): almost all the small islets within the clay-slate districts are thus composed. The slate near the dikes generally becomes paler-coloured, harder, less fissile, of a feldspathic nature, and passes into a porphyry or greenstone: in one case, however, it became more fissile, of a red colour, and contained minute scales of mica, which were absent in the <b>unaltered</b> <b>rock.</b> On the east side of Ponsonby Sound some dikes composed of a pale sonorous feldspathic rock, porphyritic with a little feldspar, were remarkable from their number,--there being within the space of a mile at least one hundred,--from their nearly equalling in bulk the intermediate slate,--and more especially from the excessive fineness (like the finest inlaid carpentry) and perfect parallelism of their junctions with the almost vertical laminae of clay-slate. I was unable to persuade myself that these great parallel masses had been injected, until I found one dike which abruptly thinned out to half its thickness, and had one of its walls jagged, with fragments of the slate embedded in it.|$|E
6000|$|Some {{considerable}} {{masses of}} wacke, which {{are associated with}} these basaltic strata, and which likewise occur in the basal series on the coast, especially at Quail Island, are curious. They consist of a pale yellowish- green argillaceous substance, of a crumbling texture when dry, but unctuous when moist: in its purest form, it is of a beautiful green tint, with translucent edges, and occasionally with obscure traces of an original cleavage. Under the blowpipe it fuses very readily into a dark grey, and sometimes even black bead, which is slightly magnetic. From these characters, I naturally {{thought that it was}} one of the pale species, decomposed, of the genus augite;--a conclusion supported by the <b>unaltered</b> <b>rock</b> being full of large separate crystals of black augite, and of balls and irregular streaks of dark grey augitic rock. As the basalt ordinarily consists of augite, and of olivine often tarnished and of a dull red colour, I was led to examine the stages of decomposition of this latter mineral, and I found, to my surprise, that I could trace a nearly perfect gradation from unaltered olivine to the green wacke. Part of the same grain under the blowpipe would in some instances behave like olivine, its colour being only slightly changed, and part would give a black magnetic bead. Hence I can have no doubt that the greenish wacke originally existed as olivine; but great chemical changes must have been effected during the act of decomposition thus to have altered a very hard, transparent, infusible mineral, into a soft, unctuous, easily melted, argillaceous substance. (D'Aubuisson [...] "Traite de Geognosie" [...] tome 2 page 569 mentions, on the authority of M. Marcel de Serres, masses of green earth near Montpellier, which are supposed to be due to the decomposition of olivine. I do not, however, find, that the action of this mineral under the blowpipe being entirely altered, as it becomes decomposed, has been noticed; and the knowledge of this fact is important, as at first it appears highly improbable that a hard, transparent, refractory mineral should be changed into a soft, easily fused clay, like this of St. Jago. I shall hereafter describe a green substance, forming threads within the cells of some vesicular basaltic rocks in Van Diemen's Land, which behave under the blowpipe like the green wacke of St. Jago; but its occurrence in cylindrical threads, shows it cannot have resulted from the decomposition of olivine, a mineral always existing in the form of grains or crystals.) ...|$|E

Limestone, dolomite, and argillaceous rocks were of particular interest because these have spectral reflectance features that might make them difficult to separate from some of the altered rocks when these images are used. The laboratory and field evaluation of a color ratio composite image, supported by in situ spectral reflectance measurements and an alteration map compiled from a published map, shows that silicified, argillized, and pyritized rocks can be mapped in detail utilizing an intense OH absorption band centered near 2. 2 t•m.

40|$|Lead isotope {{ratios of}} ores of the Candelaria- Punta del Cobre iron oxide Cu-Au {{deposits}} and asso- ciated Early Cretaceous volcanic and batholithic rocks have been determined. For the igneous rocks, a whole- rock acid attack technique {{based on the}} separate anal- yses of a leachate and the residual fraction of a sample was used. The lead isotope systematics of leachate– residue pairs are significantly different for unaltered and altered igneous rocks of the Candelaria-Punta del Cobre district. Residues of <b>unaltered</b> igneous <b>rocks</b> likely rep- resent the common lead. In contrast, residues of all the altered igneous rocks except two samples have higher Pb isotope ratios than those of <b>unaltered</b> magmatic <b>rocks</b> and cannot represent common lead. We suggest {{that this is a}} result of the hydrothermal alteration suffered by these rocks and that the common lead composition of the altered igneous (volcanic and plutonic) rocks must have been similar to that of the <b>unaltered</b> batholith <b>rocks.</b> The conclusion that the altered volcanic rocks originally had a similar common lead isotope composi- tion as the batholith is consistent with geological and geochemical arguments (e. g., setting, regional geologic evolution, ages and relative distribution of volcanic andintrusive rocks, magmatic affinities), which indicate that these rocks were derived from similar Early Cretaceous parent magmas. The modification of the leachate– residue pair lead isotope systematics of most altered igneous rocks is consistent with a selective removal of lead and uranium from these rocks by an oxidized hydrothermal fluid. The result of the hydrothermal leaching has been to alter magmatic rocks in a way that (1) their leachable fraction is presently a mix of common lead similar to that of the ore event and of radiogenic lead evolved from a source with a consistently high Th/ U, and that (2) their residual fraction has less common lead than <b>unaltered</b> <b>rocks.</b> The outcrop area with altered volcanic rocks displaying anomalously high lead isotope ratios extends over 25 km along the eastern margin of the batholith. Since lead of the ores in the Candelaria- Punta del Cobre district has the same isotopic compo- sition as the common lead of <b>unaltered</b> magmatic <b>rocks</b> of the area, the lead isotope data are consistent with a derivation of the ore lead (and by inference of other metals like Cu) both directly from a magmatic fluid exsolved during crystallization of the batholith and/or from hydrothermal leaching of the volcanic rocks orig- inally having similar isotopic compositions as the bath- olith...|$|R

50|$|Spheroidal {{weathering}} is {{the result}} of chemical weathering of systematically jointed, massive rocks, including granite, dolerite, basalt and sedimentary rocks such as silicified sandstone. It occurs {{as the result of the}} chemical alteration of such rocks along intersecting joints. The chemical alteration of the rock results in the formation of abundant secondary minerals such as kaolinite, sericite, serpentine, montmorillonite, and chlorite and a corresponding increase in the volume of the altered rock. When the joints within bedrock form a 3-dimensional network, they subdivided it into separated blocks, often in the form of cubes or rectangles, that are bounded by these joints. Because water can penetrate the bedrock along these joints, the near-surface bedrock will be altered by weathering progressively inward along the faces of these blocks. The alteration by weathering of the bedrock will be greatest along the corners of each block, followed by the edges, and finally the faces of the cube. The differences in weathering rates between the corners, edges, and faces of a bedrock block will result in the formation of spheroidal layers of altered rock that surround an unaltered rounded boulder-size core of relatively <b>unaltered</b> <b>rock</b> known as a corestone or woolsack. Spheroidal weathering has often been incorrectly attributed solely to various types of physical weathering.|$|E
50|$|In {{the rocks}} {{of this group}} {{cordierite}} also occurs, not rarely, and may have the outlines of imperfect hexagonal prisms that are divided up into six sectors when seen in polarized light. In biotite hornfels, a faint striping may indicate the original bedding of the <b>unaltered</b> <b>rock</b> and corresponds to small changes {{in the nature of}} the sediment deposited. More commonly there is a distinct spotting, visible on the surfaces of the hand specimens. The spots are round or elliptical, and may be paler or darker than the rest of the rock. In some cases they are rich in graphite or carbonaceous matter; in others they are full of brown mica; some spots consist of rather coarser grains of quartz than occur in the matrix. The frequency with which this feature reappears in the less altered slates and hornfels is rather remarkable, especially as it seems certain that the spots are not always of the same nature or origin. Tourmaline hornfels are found sometimes near the margins of tourmaline granites; they are black with small needles of schorl that under the microscope are dark brown and richly pleochroic. As the tourmaline contains boron, there must have been some permeation of vapors from the granite into the sediments. Rocks of this group are often seen in the Cornish tin-mining districts, especially near the ludes.|$|E

A map has been prepared which can be regarded as an excellent reconnaissance exploration map, for use in targeting areas for more detailed geological, geochemical, and geophysical studies. Mafic and felsic rock types are easily discriminated on the color stretched-ratio composite. The ratioing process minimizes albedo effects, leaving only the recorded characteristic spectral response. The spectra of <b>unaltered</b> <b>rocks</b> appear different from those of altered rocks, which are typically dominated by limonite and clay minerals.

Preliminary analysis indicates that mineralogical differences between altered <b>rocks</b> and most <b>unaltered</b> <b>rocks</b> in south-central Nevada cause visible and near infrared spectral reflectance differences, {{which can be}} used to discriminate these broad categories of rocks in multispectral images. The most important mineralogical differences are the increased abundance of goethite, hematite, and jarosite, and the presence of alunite, montmorillonite, and kaolinite in the altered rock. The technique to enhance subtle spectral differences combines ratioing of the MSS bands and contrast stretching. The stretched ratio values are used to produce black and white images that depict materials according to spectral reflectance; rationing minimizes the influence of topography and overall albedo on the grouping of spectrally similar materials. Field evaluation of color-ratio composite shows that, excluding alluvial areas, approximately 80 percent of the green and brown color patterns are related to hydrothermal alternation.

The largest albitite occurrences in Europe, mined for albite, {{are located}} in Central Sardinia, at the Southern margin of the Tirso river rift valley, where the Hercynian granitoid massif {{extensively}} crops out. The parent rocks of the albitites are the Hercynian granitoids, mainly granodiorites, which consist of quartz, plagioclase and K-feldspar. Biotite and allanite are the main accessory minerals. The main mineralogical association of albitites consists of rarely zoned plagioclase and quartz. Subordinate minerals are K-feldspar, biotite, chlorite, epidote, titanite, and muscovite. Compared to the <b>unaltered</b> <b>rock,</b> the albitites generally show higher Na 2 O and Al 2 O 3 contents, while Fe 2 O 3, K 2 O, Rb e Ba, are generally depleted. This suggests that plagioclase, K-feldspar and biotite were affected by remarkable chemical-structural transformations, involving their dissolution and recrystallization in newly formed minerals. The mobilization of Rare Earth Elements (REE) caused a re-distribution of these elements in the albitites. The REE are mainly accommodated in epidotes (LREE) and in titanites (HREE).

To avoid this problem, we propose a novel approach that combined two methods: spectral unmixing and full-pixel classification. First, all pixels were divided into two categories, hydrothermally altered areas and unaltered rocks based on the absorption depth of 2. 0 to 2. 5 μm. For the hydrothermally altered areas, endmembers were extracted by the Improved Causal Random Pixel Purity Index (ICRPPI) method, which was improved from the existing Pixel Purity Index (PPI) and Causal Random Pixel Purity Index (CRPPI) methods. Endmember abundance in each pixel was calculated by linear spectral unmixing. In a separate operation, k-means clustering was applied to the <b>unaltered</b> <b>rock</b> areas. Finally, the results of these two methods were combined to generate a single distribution map of rocks and minerals. This approach was applied to the airborne hyperspectral HyMap data of Cuprite, Nevada, U. S. A. We confirmed that our mapping result was consistent with the existing geological map as well as our field survey result...|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of the rocks that make up Cades Cove are <b>unaltered</b> sedimentary <b>rocks</b> formed between 340 million and 570 million years ago during the Ordovician Period. [...] The Precambrian rocks that comprise the high ridges surrounding the cove are Ocoee Supergroup sandstones, formed approximately one billion years ago. [...] The mountains themselves were formed between 200 million and 400 million years ago during the Appalachian orogeny, when the North American and African plates collided, thrusting the older rock formations over the younger formations.|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} is less complete than desired, chiefly because the writer {{has not been}} able to visit the property. Accordingly, no first-hand observations on the field relationships are possible. Furthermore, the suite of specimens on which the study Is based was not collected primarily for this purpose, and has certain deficiencies, e. g., the relatively <b>unaltered</b> county <b>rock</b> type away from the mineralized zone. Despite these limitations, the description of the unusual mineral association and some conclusions derived therefrom are regarded as worthwhile contributions...|$|R
