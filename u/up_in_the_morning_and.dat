25|$|A schema (pl. schemata) is {{the mental}} {{framework}} that is created as children {{interact with their}} physical and social environments. For example, many 3-year-olds insist that the sun is alive because it comes <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> goes down at night. According to Piaget, these children are operating based on a simple cognitive schema that things that move are alive. At any age, children rely on their current cognitive structures to understand the world around them. Moreover, younger and older children may often interpret {{and respond to the}} same objects and events in very different ways because cognitive structures take different forms at different ages.|$|E

500|$|English {{also makes}} {{frequent}} use of constructions traditionally called phrasal verbs, verb phrases that {{are made up of}} a verb root and a preposition or particle which follows the verb. The phrase then functions as a single predicate. In terms of intonation the preposition is fused to the verb, but in writing it is written as a separate word. Examples of phrasal verbs are to get up, to ask out, to back up, to give up, to get together, to hang out, to put up with, etc. The phrasal verb frequently has a highly idiomatic meaning that is more specialised and restricted than what can be simply extrapolated from the combination of verb and preposition complement (e.g. lay off meaning terminate someone's employment). In spite of the idiomatic meaning, some grammarians, including , do not consider this type of construction to form a syntactic constituent and hence refrain from using the term [...] "phrasal verb". Instead they consider the construction simply to be a verb with a prepositional phrase as its syntactic complement, i.e. he woke <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> he ran up in the mountains are syntactically equivalent.|$|E

[...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] was about Davis' drug abuse, and the fear that gripped him {{at the height of}} his drug problem. He pleaded for a divine intervention to deliver him from his nightmare, as if he cannot help himself. Davis explained: [...] "I'd wake <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> do a line to get out of bed. Speed in the morning, I'd have it all lined up for breakfast so when I'd lay down and go to sleep, I'd wake up and just snort and it's like 'Yeah, okay, I'm up. ' It was bad. It's like, you do one line and stay up all night, but then you have shit to do the next day so you have to do another line to be able keep staying up to get that shit done. Eventually you start spinning-out from sleep deprivation. You get hallucinations and shit like that." [...] Davis said that [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] "is about meth.

[...] Describing the loading bay, to which local children had easy access, one witness recalled: [...] "Sometimes sacks were left out overnight. They were hessian sacks and they were full of a sort of fluffy dust. We could jump on the sacks when they were left out... I remember seeing grey-blue coloured dust come out of them. If we jumped hard enough the sacks burst open. After sitting or bouncing on the sacks I remember being covered in dust."

2500|$|The album's opening track, [...] "Thick as Thieves", penned by {{the band}} with Gabriel, was {{described}} by Emmy Mack of Music Feeds as a track that [...] "thumps along" [...] with a [...] "tribal-style tom beat, wild west guitar arpeggios, [...] an Electric Light Orchestra-style bassline". Mandagi, who himself described the track as a [...] "jangly guitar song", stated {{that he had the}} idea for the song's guitar riff for years, long before he had sat down with guitarist Joseph Greer and [...] "worked it out in his old flat one day." [...] Lyrically, the album was motivated by various experiences in each of the band members' personal lives. One such example is in the album's second track, [...] "So Much Sky", inspired by bassist Jonathon Aherne and Mandagi's trip to Tanzania, meeting with the Massai tribe as part of an initiative with Faces4Hope, a christian charity organization supporting villages and tribes in East Africa, with whom the band were involved with. The band had written the song mostly {{in the image of the}} Massai, their village, and the view of the nearby Mount Kilimanjaro. Mandagi explained, [...] "being out in the open plains and waking <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> seeing Mount Kilimanjaro popping up just above the clouds. It was a really inspirational experience and we got a song out of it." [...] The third track on the album, [...] "Burn", penned by the band with Parker, was noted by Dundas as one of the band's favorites on the record. Written early on in the recording sessions, [...] "Burn" [...] was built from two different compositions which were, according to Dundas, [...] "gradually morphed together as one as we were recording." [...] Kim Taylor Bennett of Noisey compared the track to [...] "U2's sky-scraping bombast with a bass drum thwack and crash reminiscent of [...] "Be My Baby" [...] by The Ronettes." [...] Mandagi touts [...] "Alive", the sixth track on Thick as Thieves, as the band's [...] "sexiest number for sure", with [...] "all swagger and menacing bass lines." [...] The song was further described by Laurence Day of The Line of Best Fit as one with a [...] "quivering bassline and sharp, punchy beats, and a to-the-rafters chorus erupts to relieve the tension." ...|$|E
