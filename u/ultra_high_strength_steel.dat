However the poor formability of these steels limits their application for many parts in the car body. A solution approach to this limitation can be a local heat treatment to soften the material where a high formability is needed. This paper will report on the first results of local heat treatment of <b>ultra</b> <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> <b>steels</b> using induction and laser technology carried out in an European project. Laser treatment was performed using high power Nd:YAG-lasers. The induction heat treatment was carried out with a 6 kW generator and multi-turn induction coils of pancake shape. In both processes the output power was temperature controlled to achieve a constant temperature level during the heat treatment. The materials under investigation are dual phase steels with a tensile strength of 1000 MPa and 1400 MPa. The thickness of the sheets are 1. 2, 1. 5 and 2 mm. It will be shown that induction and laser heating {{have a significant effect}} on microstructure and mechanical properties. The initial martensite/ferrite- or martensite-structure is tempered or annealed depending on the maximum temperature and the time-temperature characteristic achieved during heat treatment. In general the characteristic features of the microstructure formed within the local heat-treated area are tempering and lowering of the amount of martensite. However, the amount, size and distribution of martensite can vary to some extent. Both tempering and annealing result in a significant hardness reduction. The hardness is reduced about 30 - 50 %.

By use of sequential heated or cooled tools, different mechanical properties distributed within the same component are achieved.

Empirical research has been performed to offer new approaches for improved joint strength and to increase knowledge on cracking mechanisms in resistance projection welding and resistance spot welding of UHSS.

An approach to improve the ductility and strength of resistance spotwelds in UHSS using reduced cooling time was unsuccessful. The reduced cooling rate after weld metal solidification did not fully create the desired softened microstructure.

40|$|In {{the vehicle}} {{industry}} {{there is a}} constant struggle to develop cars with high passive safety without increasing the fuel consumption. High passive safety requires a very rigid behaviour of the crash protecting components. Accomplishing this often leads to an increase in the weight of the components. An increase in weight results in a higher fuel consumption which is bad for the environment {{as well as for the}} economy of the car owner, therefore the manufacturers turn to new materials. One of these new materials is <b>ultra</b> <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> <b>steel</b> which is the material in focus for the present thesis. To be able to utilize all the advantages of <b>ultra</b> <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> <b>steel</b> the material behaviour must be investigated in detail. In this thesis, sheets of <b>ultra</b> <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> <b>steel,</b> which are produced by press-hardening, are investigated using a method called digital speckle photography. When using the method of digital speckle photography (DSP) a series of photographs are taken of a deforming specimen. Prior to the experiment a random pattern (speckles) has been applied to the specimen and by studying the deforming speckle pattern on the images, the deformation fields through time can be established. Within the present thesis the deformation fields up to the point of fracture have been investigated on a length scale of the order of 10 e- 4 meters. With length scales of this magnitude the deformation inside a localized neck can be investigated. This is done, both for a specimen shape that induces a fracture initiation at an inner point of the specimen and a specimen shape where fracture starts from the edge of a hole. These investigations show that there is a strong localization of the strain before fracture is initiated. The local strain values inside a localized neck are significantly higher than the strain values that can be observed with conventional experimental techniques involving extensometers. It is also noticed that the method used to make holes play an important role for the onset of fracture. Some methods hardly affect the material at all while others can decrease the level of local strain at the onset of fracture down to about a third of the value for unaffected material. Furthermore, a method for characterizing the material based on full-field measurements is presented. The method is a fast and simple alternative to previously used inverse modelling procedures where the material model of a finite element simulation is updated iteratively to make the simulation produce the same results as the experiment.

However, the introduction of UHSS can result in significantly increased wear of the stamping tools, which is difficult to predict at the design stage and can lead to unexpected process failure during mass-production. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} be able to monitor and predict the onset of severe wear, such that the best course of condition-based maintenance can be scheduled and unscheduled stoppages due to tool wear eradicated. This paper describes a novel active monitoring system that is being developed by researchers at Deakin University, The Australian National University and Ford Motor Company, Asia Pacific and Africa. The aim of the active monitoring system is to detect the initial onset of a change of state, such as wear, through the measurement of variables such as punch force and audio signals. A semi-industrial stamping process, using a progressive die setup and <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> <b>steel</b> sheet with hardened tool steel tooling, is the experimental basis for the initial model and system development...|$|R

ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 worrd) A II. -The influence of inclusion distributions and fine scale microstructure on the fract,, toughness and fracture processes of <b>ultra</b> <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> <b>steels</b> have been investigated. The inclusion distributions vary in the sulfide type and the sulfide types considered were MnS, CrS, La 2 O 2 S and Ti 2 CS. The MnS and CrS particles are smaller and more closely spaced than particles of La 202 S. Resistance to void nucleation is the same if the sulfur is gettered as CrS, MnS or La 202 S. The particles of Ti 2 CS are smaller and much more resistant to void nucleation than the other sulfide types. The fine scale microstructures were those obtained for the as-quenched, tempered at 4250 C and tempered at 510 0 C conditions for HY 180 and AF 1410 steels. The topics then addressed are (a) effect of fine scale microstructure and inclusion distributions on blunting behavior, (b) the role o...|$|R
40|$|<b>Ultra</b> <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> <b>steels</b> are of {{enormous}} interest {{especially in the}} automotive industry due to their potential in realising light weight structures and improving the crash behaviour. However the poor formability of these steels limits their application for many parts in the car body. A solution to this limitation can be a local heat treatment using a laser beam to soften the material where a high formability is needed. Laser treatment was performed using a Nd:YAG laser with 3 kW maximum power. The output power was temperature controlled to achieve a constant temperature level during the heat treatment. Large areas are treated by scanning the surface with the laser beam. The materials under investigation are dual phase (DP), retained austenite (RA), complex phase (CP) and martensitic (MS) steels with a tensile strength of 700 - 1400 MPa. The thickness of the sheets lies between 1. 2 and 2 mm. Depending on material and process parameters tempering of martensite, formation of ferrite and transformation of retained austentite are observed {{as a result of}} the heat treatment. For DP and M steels this changes in microstructure are accompanied by a reduction in hardness and yield strength, whereas CP and RA steels show no significant effect on the mechanical properties. Forming tests of a mock-up geometry reveal a reduction in forming capacity...|$|R
