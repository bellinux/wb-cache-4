500|$|The game {{makes use}} of the Hedgehog Engine, the game engine Sonic Team used for {{developing}} Unleashed. To help decide which levels would appear in the game, Sega polled all their employees on their favorite Sonic levels, researched the core fanbase, and conducted an internet survey, with the levels they found most popular being {{the ones that were}} incorporated into the game. One of the main rules Sonic Team made during development was not to use older assets or level designs, and certain levels were given a new visual element to provide a new dynamic, such as the underground caves in Green Hill. In choosing levels for the 3DS version, the team opted to <b>use</b> <b>levels</b> from the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS Sonic games rather than the original Game Gear games, wanting to <b>use</b> <b>levels</b> from games of more recent memory. According to Iizuka, one of the hardest parts of developing Generations was adapting 3D levels to 2D, since their [...] "defining" [...] elements and themes were designed to specifically work in 3D. Recreating the [...] "classic"-style Sonic gameplay using the Hedgehog Engine was also cited as challenging, since the engine was designed for [...] "modern" [...] gameplay. The Spin Dash ability was also made quicker to use to help younger players unfamiliar with it. The team faced bigger difficulties developing on the 3DS; Iizuka claimed they were unfamiliar with the system's capabilities and limitations.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground and objectiveAlthough {{positive}} {{screening for}} {{and treatment of}} obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have been recommended for patients with cardiovascular problems, patient adherence to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy primarily for a cardiovascular concern is unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the adherence to CPAP therapy by hypertensive patients with OSA after a screening test performed regardless of OSA-related symptoms. Subjects and methodsCPAP therapy was administered to 194 of the 1365 hypertensive patients who underwent the screening. The monthly dropout from CPAP therapy and the adequate <b>use</b> <b>level</b> (4 h every night, 70 % days in a month) were assessed using the Kaplan–Meier analysis over a 3 -year follow-up period. ResultsOf the patients, 106 (55 %) refused or abandoned the therapy {{by the end of}} the follow-up period (adherence, 45 %). An adequate <b>use</b> <b>level</b> was maintained by 76 patients (39 %). Most of the patients’ background characteristics, including age, sex, Epworth sleepiness scale scores, and parameters obtained on polysomnography, were not related to adherence or adequate <b>use</b> <b>level.</b> The good-compliance level on the first visit after CPAP therapy introduction was most strongly related to adherence (95 % CI, 0. 05 – 0. 32; p< 0. 001) and adequate <b>use</b> <b>level</b> (95 % CI, 0. 06 – 0. 33; p< 0. 05). Fourth quartile of apnea hypopnea index value (greater than 67 /h) was also related to adherence (95 % CI, 0. 21 – 0. 98; p< 0. 02) and adequate <b>use</b> <b>level</b> (95 % CI, 0. 19 – 0. 88; p< 0. 05). ConclusionsThe adherence and <b>use</b> <b>level</b> in this population may not be satisfactory but are comparable with those in previous sleep center reports treating symptomatic OSA patients. Thus, the present results would encourage hypertensive patients to undergo positive screening for OSA, regardless of OSA-related symptoms. However, an outcomes study with the same cohort is needed...|$|R
