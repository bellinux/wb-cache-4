25|$|Although suicide {{was officially}} {{accepted}} {{as the cause}} of death, some medical experts have raised doubts, suggesting that the evidence does not support this. The most detailed objection was provided in a letter from three medical doctors published in The Guardian, reinforced by support from two other senior doctors in a later letter to the newspaper. These doctors argued that the post-mortem finding of a transected <b>ulnar</b> <b>artery</b> could not have caused a degree of blood loss that would kill someone, particularly when outside in the cold (where vasoconstriction would cause slow blood loss). Further, this conflicted with the minimal amount of blood found at the scene. They also contended that the amount of co-proxamol found was only about a third of what would normally be fatal. Dr Rouse, a British epidemiologist wrote to the British Medical Journal offering his opinion that the act of committing suicide by severing the wrist arteries is an extremely rare occurrence in a 59-year-old man with no previous psychiatric history. Nobody else died from that cause during the year.|$|E

40|$|Arterial {{variations}} in the arm are of potential clinical implications {{as it is a}} frequent site of injury and also involved in many surgical and invasive procedures. During a dissection of the right upper extremity, an abnormal high origin of the radial and <b>ulnar</b> <b>arteries</b> was found. The brachial artery had a very short segment without any branches, divided into the radial and <b>ulnar</b> <b>arteries</b> at the upper third of the arm. The course and branching pattern of these radial and <b>ulnar</b> <b>arteries</b> in the arm are discussed. It was also observed that the profunda brachii artery was represented by two separate branches arising from the posterior circumflex humeral artery. Accurate knowledge of these variation patterns is of considerable clinical importance in the conduct of reparative surgeries around the shoulder and fracture management of the humerus. These additional data of arterial anomalies to contemporary anatomical literature are of interest to clinicians, in particular vascular and plastic surgeons and radiologists...|$|R

We contrast this view with a view based on the theory of mental models, in which the judged probability of a conditional is derived from the proportion of models in which the premises are true.

40|$|Background: High {{bifurcation}} of the {{brachial artery}} {{is a common}} anatomic variant, with a prevalence of 12 - 20 % and a challenging Doppler identification. This variant may have hemodynamic implications and compromise {{the success of a}} native arteriovenous fistula (AVF). The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the hemodynamic characteristics of the upper limb arterial axis based on the location of the brachial bifurcation in patients in need of a vascular access for hemodialysis. Methods: Cross sectional observational study with retrospective data collection. The studied variables were arterial diameter, flow, peak systolic velocity and resistance index of the brachial, radial and <b>ulnar</b> <b>arteries</b> in patients proposed for first vascular access construction between February 2011 and January 2014. Results: Of 153 patients studied, 6, 53 % had high brachial artery bifurcation. In these patients, the diameter of the brachial artery was smaller (3, 77 mm± 0, 64 vs. 4, 38 mm± 1, 2; p< 0, 05) and the resistance index was higher (0, 97 ± 0, 68 vs. 2, 18 ± 0, 58; p< 0, 05). The remaining variables were not statistically different. Conclusions: The brachial, radial and <b>ulnar</b> <b>arteries</b> flow and peak systolic velocity, as well as the diameter and resistance index of the radial and <b>ulnar</b> <b>arteries</b> were independent of the location of the brachial artery bifurcation. The lack of differences in hemodynamic distal arteries characteristics suggests that the success of distal vascular access is not compromised. The smaller diameter and higher resistance index found in the high brachial artery bifurcation patients may recommend an exhaustive research of this anatomical variant in preoperative mapping, since it might influence the proximal vascular access success...|$|R
50|$|It is the {{continuation}} of the axillary artery beyond the lower margin of teres major muscle. It continues down the ventral surface of the arm until it reaches the cubital fossa at the elbow. It then divides into the radial and <b>ulnar</b> <b>arteries</b> which run down the forearm. In some individuals, the bifurcation occurs much earlier and the <b>ulnar</b> and radial <b>arteries</b> extend through the upper arm.The pulse of the brachial artery is palpable on the anterior aspect of the elbow, medial to the tendon of the biceps, and, {{with the use of a}} stethoscope and sphygmomanometer (blood pressure cuff) often used to measure the blood pressure.|$|R
40|$|A rare {{variation}} of bilateral incomplete palmar arch was observed during routine dissection of a cadaver. <b>Ulnar</b> <b>arteries</b> {{gave rise to}} two common palmar digital arteries supplying the ring and little fingers and one proper palmar digital <b>artery,</b> which supplied <b>ulnar</b> side of little finger. Radial artery gave rise to two common palmar digital arteries that supplied the remaining fingers. Right side also had a palmar carpal branch from deep palmar arch...|$|R

50|$|It is {{important}} to perform an Allen Test to confirm the patency of the ulnar artery—because, with no collateral flow through the <b>ulnar</b> <b>artery,</b> radial artery puncture {{can result in a}} gangrenous finger or loss of the hand from spasm or clotting of the radial artery. The Allen Test is performed with the patient sitting with hands resting on knees. A medical professional stands at the patient's side with fingers around the patient's wrist and compresses the tissue over both radial and ulnar arteries for a few minutes—waiting for the blood to drain from the hand while the patient opens and closes the hand several times. Releasing pressure on the <b>ulnar</b> <b>artery</b> while keeping the radial artery occluded should return normal skin color to the ulnar side of the palm in one to two seconds, followed by quick restoration of normal color to the entire palm. A hand that remains white indicates either absence or occlusion of the <b>ulnar</b> <b>artery,</b> and radial artery puncture is contraindicated.|$|E
