Through both, theoretical and empirical studies, three major determinants were identified: accessibility, industrial structure, and development institutions. The term "accessibility" indicates-not only physical nearness but also functional connections with relevant areas. The findings -of the research show that there are strong positive relationship between-accessibility and <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> in -Korea. As a composite economic indicator, - urban industrial structure reflects the soundness of urban economic activities in terms of employment opportunities, income generation, and innovation adoption. Thus, it can be assumed that an urban place which has a more advanced industrial structure can bring more <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> than one without such a structure. This study suggests that <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> in Korea has been strongly influenced by manufacturing oriented' industry growth. Development institutions have particular meanings for <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> in Korea as <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> has been greatly influenced by development policies initiated by central government. These include economic development, national land development, and industrial location policies. These three determinants reinforce or counteract each other to influence the speed and direction of <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> and change. The impacts of these determinants can change according to the circumstances of the <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> environment in Korea. The meaning of locational factors has changed from their physical aspects to their functional oriented aspects. In many more developed countries, the emphasis has shifted from manufacturing oriented industrial structures to service and/or information oriented industrial activities. Development institutions, can also be changed from centralised to decentralised forms in terms of decision making regarding <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> and change. However, although circumstances may changes, the importance of the three determinants will not be weakened because of their critical importance for <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> and change. These three determinants are proxy factors of three important aspects in the urban environment: accessibility for location, industrial structure for economic activities, and development institutions for the institutional context. The findings of this research suggest that <b>urban,</b> <b>growth</b> policies should focus on the administration of these three determinants. Without efficient management for these determinants, -it will be very difficult to tackle national spatial -problems.

The light intensities were transformed into urban gravity variables depending on the distance of sample villages from the city, and their growth rates used for the analysis in regression equations. The key findings are as follows: Equal <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> in all locations has an elasticity of 0. 50 on agricultural income growth, and of 0. 19 on rural non-farm income <b>growth.</b> <b>Urban</b> <b>growth</b> also has a large effect on education, followed by commercialization {{and then on the}} use of modern varieties. These in turn have a strong impact on agricultural and rural non-farm income. National <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> has a larger impact on agricultural and rural non-farm <b>growth</b> than local <b>urban</b> <b>growth.</b> Once we account for the other control variables (roads, education, commercialization, modern varieties), the <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> impact on agricultural growth is cut in half and for rural non-farm <b>growth</b> the <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> impact disappears. For non-farm income almost the full impact of <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> can be explained by its impacts on education.

40|$|Population <b>growth,</b> {{especially}} in <b>urban</b> areas, {{is projected to}} increase in the near future. In response, residential growth is commonly channelled into <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> areas located on the suburban fringe of major city centres. There {{is a need for}} adequate infrastructure provision, such as health services, to meet the population demands in <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> areas. Access to health services is a key social determinant of health, and having adequate access can help reduce health inequities. This review examines literature considering primary and secondary health services access in new <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> areas, with a focus on Melbourne, Australia. Academic and grey literature were sourced and reviewed. Themes revealed include challenges in providing spatial and social access to health services. Both nationally and internationally, we found that few studies considered health services access when planning for <b>urban</b> <b>growth.</b> Further research is required to examine how health service access is planned for in <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> areas. Such research may contribute to reducing health inequity...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Like other {{developing}} countries, Iranian cities are growing and expanding physically {{at a high}} speed. For about five decades, the only policy of the urban development plans {{in the field of}} <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> management has been definition of the <b>Urban</b> <b>Growth</b> Boundary (U. G. B.) which is still used without any major modifications. Despite the slight evidences indicating the ineffectiveness of the current policy, there has not been any assured and agreed alternative yet. Today, the waves of new urbanism and other modern paradigms have urged temptations of making fundamental changes in the definition of <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> boundary. Through an analytic framework, this research investigates the effectiveness {{of some of the most}} basic carriers of <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> in 11 sample cities (each of them introducing one type of Iranian cities). The results of this analysis will illustrate a new vision- a native one- for alternative policies of <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> management in Iranian cities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Zhujiang Delta of South China has {{experienced}} a rapid urban expansion {{over the past two}} decades due to accelerated economic growth. This paper reports an investigation into the application of the integration of remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) for detecting <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> and assessing its impact on surface temperature in the region. Remote sensing techniques were used to carry out land use/cover change detection by using multitemporal Landsat Thematic Mapper data. <b>Urban</b> <b>growth</b> patterns were analysed by using a GIS-based modelling approach. The integration of remote sensing and GIS was further applied to examine the impact of <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> on surface temperatures. The results revealed a notable and uneven <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> in the study area. This urban development had raised surface radiant temperature by 13. 01 K in the urbanized area. The integration of remote sensing and GIS was found to be eVective in monitoring and analysing <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> patterns, and in evaluating urbanization impact on surface temperature. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop and implement a Cellular Automata (CA) algorithm to simulate <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> process. Indianapolis city, Indiana is selected as a case study to simulate its <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> over the last three decades. <b>Urban</b> <b>growth</b> simulation for an artificial city is carried out first. It evaluates a number of urban sprawl parameters including the size and shape of neighborhood besides testing different types of constraints on <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> simulation. The results indicate that circular-type neighborhood shows smoother but faster <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> as compared to nine-cell Moore neighborhood. Also, CA rules definition is critical stage in simulating the <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> pattern in a close manner to reality. Next step includes running the developed CA simulation over classified remotely sensed historical imagery in a developed ArcGIS toolkit. A set of crisp rules are defined and calibrated based on real <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> pattern. Uncertainty analysis is performed to evaluate the accuracy of the simulated results as compared to the historical ground truth images. Evaluation shows promising results represented by the high average accuracies achieved. The average accuracy for the predicted growth images 1987 (for a period of 5 years) and 2003 (for a period of 10 years) is over 80 %. Modifying CA growth rules over time to match the growth pattern changes is important to obtain accurate simulation. This modification is based on the <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> relationship for Indianapolis over time as can be seen in the historical images. The feedback obtained from comparing the simulated and ground truth images is crucial in identifying the optimal set of CA rules for reliable simulation and calibrating growth steps...|$|R
40|$|It is {{undoubtedly}} true that modern Indian cities were built during the British Rule and present day Indian urbanisation is {{the fruit of}} the past colonial legacy. Even today India records a very low rate of urbanisation (30 per cent) but the erstwhile colonial port cities record remarkable <b>urban</b> <b>growth.</b> Kolkata, previously known as Calcutta once enjoyed the status of the administrative capital of British India and still today, its growth and land uses are highly influenced by the past colonial rule. Earlier the city was racially segregated into White Town, exclusively built for the British officers, Native Town for Indians and in between Grey Town which was mainly the residing place of other foreign communities. Though after the Independence (1947) followed by the heart-breaking event of the Partition, Kolkata experienced population explosion and unprecedented <b>urban</b> <b>growth.</b> For combating the unplanned and sudden <b>urban</b> <b>growth,</b> the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) has introduced careful planning and spatial transformation, but the <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> is still not uniform across the city. There is a marked difference between the former White Town and Native Town in terms of <b>urban</b> <b>growth.</b> Through this paper, it has been tried to identify how the past colonial rule still affects the <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> of Kolkata. Secondary data (collected from the Census and various other documents) analysis and GIS mapping techniques are utilised to show variation in <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> and spatial transformation within the city...|$|R
