25|$|Nietzsche {{considered}} a free spirit {{to be the}} embodiment of a transvaluation of all values. Prior to Nietzsche's time, he claimed, the scientific method of searching for truth and knowledge was met with scorn and derision. A quiet, cautious, modest manner was seen with contempt. Our present modesty compels <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> man's derivation from animals, not divinities. Also, we know that man is not superior to other animals. By reducing man to a mere machine, devoid of free will, we have learned much about his physiology. Will is now {{known to be a}} necessary reaction to a stimulus. Consciousness and spirit derive from instinct.|$|E

500|$|A much-publicized {{event of}} Fillmore's {{presidency}} was the arrival in late 1851 of Lajos Kossuth, the exiled {{leader of a}} failed Hungarian revolution against Austria. Kossuth wanted the <b>U.S.</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> Hungary's independence. Many Americans were sympathetic to the Hungarian rebels, especially recent German immigrants, who were now coming to the U.S. in large numbers and had become a major political force. Kossuth was feted by Congress, and Fillmore allowed a White House meeting after receiving word that Kossuth would not try to politicize it. [...] In spite of his promise, Kossuth made a speech promoting his cause. [...] The American enthusiasm for Kossuth petered out, and he departed for Europe; Fillmore refused to change American policy, remaining neutral.|$|E
500|$|The philosopher of {{politics}} Roger D. Masters reviewed {{the book for}} the American Political Science Review, stating {{that it was impossible}} both to review the book and not to do so, given the [...] "attention" [...] it had received. In his view, the book [...] "has the indisputable merit of showing that the existence of complex societies is a biological phenomenon. By emphasizing the relationships between animal behavior and population genetics, Wilson compels <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> the evolutionary significance of events which social scientists often treat without reference to Darwinian biology." [...] But there was [...] "a large gap" [...] between that and the work of most political scientists, and it was too early to attempt to apply sociobiology directly to human social issues in practice. He concluded that the book was fascinating, provocative, and the start of a return to the tradition [...] "as old as Aristotle" [...] where man is seen as [...] "a 'political animal'", since social behaviour had natural origins.|$|E
2500|$|He {{claims that}} the [...] "Great Forgetting blinds us {{to the fact that}} we are {{biological}} species in a community of biological species and are not exempt or exemptible from the forces that shape all life on this planet."

2500|$|We cannot {{conceive}} of God sanctioning undeserved suffering… When {{a law of}} Torah conflicts with morality, when the law is 'unpleasant', {{we are committed to}} find a way to address the problem… We are willing to do explicitly what was largely implicit in the past, namely, to make changes when needed on moral grounds. It is our desire to strengthen Torah that forces <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize,</b> explicitly the overriding importance of morality, a morality which we learn from the larger, unfolding narrative of our tradition ...|$|E
2500|$|As later {{noted in}} Koestler's autobiography, Hughes, {{together}} with some forty other Black Americans, {{had originally been}} invited to the Soviet Union to produce a Soviet film on [...] "Negro Life", but the Soviets dropped the film idea because of their 1933 success in getting the <b>US</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> the Soviet Union and establish an embassy in Moscow. This entailed a toning down of Soviet propaganda on racial segregation in America. Hughes and his fellow Blacks were not informed {{of the reasons for the}} cancelling, but he and Koestler worked it out for themselves.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{introduction}} to his book Topics in Geometric Group Theory, Pierre de la Harpe wrote: [...] "One of my personal beliefs is that fascination with symmetries and groups {{is one way of}} coping with frustrations of life's limitations: we like to recognize symmetries which allow <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> more than what we can see. In this sense the study of geometric group theory is a part of culture, and reminds me of several things that Georges de Rham practices on many occasions, such as teaching mathematics, reciting Mallarmé, or greeting a friend" [...] (page 3 in [...] ).|$|E

2500|$|... "In most conflicts, {{each party}} is certain {{he is right}} and the other wrong. And in the reality he lives in, this is {{genuinely}} the case. But in order to solve a conflict like ours, {{it is necessary to}} step into the reality of the 'other' – to see the world and events from his subjective perspective so that we can reconcile his reality with our own and merge these opposing versions of events into a bigger holistic truth inclusive enough to encompass both ostensibly rival truths. These subjective perceptions of reality constitute unique 'movies' in which we are each the protagonist. And any genuine approach to Israeli–Palestinian peace requires <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> the completely separate broader movies our two peoples each collectively live in. Both have experienced the past hundred years very differently and the major obstacle to attaining peace has almost nothing to do with territory but rather the inability on both sides to acknowledge, understand or accept the narrative of the 'other' without defensively feeling our own narratives threatened. I define the term 'narrative' here as a version of reality – a story told about a chain of events that organizes facts while being influenced by ideology. The same chain of events can be organized into many narratives, especially if influenced by different ideologies. The separate movies we live in very much impact how we relate to history, to ourselves and to each other in this country. Both sides tend to approach the conflict as a zero-sum game where there can only be one winner. And the conflict continues to rage partially because many of us are so trapped within our narrow paradigms that we refuse to acknowledge how things may look from different perspectives. Advocates on both sides often cite hard facts to support their positions. And while these facts might be true, they are not the only facts. And how we select, connect, contextualize and understand them is very much determined by the movies we live in. ... There is so much blame and pain powering this conflict. And acknowledging the narrative of the 'other' often feels like betraying our own. But if we can learn to see the greater movie comprising both our smaller movies and define the core aspirations and grievances of each side, we can begin to chart a course that allows both peoples to be protagonists in a single story that successfully transcends the dualistic 'Arab versus Jew' paradigm and enables us all to experience the fulfillment of our deepest yearnings." ...|$|E
