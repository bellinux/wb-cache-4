During {{the early years of}} their career, influenced by contemporaries Shepard Fairey, BAST, and WK Interact, FAILE generated both a process of assemblage and <b>urban</b> <b>circulation,</b> and consistent visual cues and themes. One such example is the Challenger space shuttle, which crashed shortly after its launch in 1986. Not only does the shuttle appear in various forms in much of FAILE’s work, the year “1986” is appended to their pieces as a signature that both invokes their specific use of the shuttle image, and also a reminder to their audience of the event itself, of its role in their personal history. “1986” is both indicative of a populist or dialogic impulse in much of FAILE’s work, and also an example of the characteristic ambivalence or dualism in their practice. [...] Recurring themes of binaries such as love/hate, peace/war, triumph/calamity, satiation/desire are all prevalent in work that seems to assimilate the global urban landscape but tenders only oblique opinions about that landscape.|$|E

This study investigates {{the impacts of}} urban-rural contrasts in terms of momentum roughness length (z 0) and aerodynamic surface temperature (TSK) on dry planetary boundary layers (PBLs) using large-eddy simulations (LES) with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. In addition, the impacts of small-scale heterogeneities within urban areas are also examined. The original WRF-LES is modified {{in order to use}} prescribed TSK as surface boundary conditions. Numerical simulations are then conducted to examine turbulence characteristics and mesoscale circulations resulting from large-scale urban-rural contrasts as well as small-scale heterogeneities in urban areas. The results indicate that (1) the urban-rural contrasts in z 0 and TSK have significant but different impacts on surface heat fluxes, mesoscale circulations, and the wind and potential temperature profiles. Compared to the case where the whole domain is homogeneous, increases in z 0 and/or TSK in urban areas in the center of domain induce stronger sensible heat fluxes, stronger <b>urban</b> <b>circulations,</b> and weaker inversions {{at the top of the}} PBL.

The trend that vegetables circulation mainly on the agricultural wholesale market basis is now developing to the mode of large scale and national wide area circulation.

On the contrary,urban faubourgs's vegetable production and circulation {{is becoming more and more}} difficult. That is to say it is assumed that large-scale vegetable circulation are oppressing and hindering the urban faubourgs's small scale vegetable production and circulation. Although there are a lot of study on the analysis of the Chinese vegetables circulation, there still exist two problems. The first is that the previous study analyzed the problem from the aspect of wholesalers' or retailers’merchandise purchasing behaviors separately, they did not analyze or discuss the development trend of vegetable circulation system itself which including the main circulation bodies such as wholesalers and retailers.

For the most part, in these accounts, the infrastructure networks, their material fabric, everyday practices and political economies, have remained unexamined. In this paper, it is argued that this is a critical omission and an approach is developed for understanding how urban responses to climate change both configure and are configured by infrastructure networks. Central to any such analysis is the conception of how and why (urban) infrastructure networks undergo change. Focusing on urban energy networks and on the case of London, the paper argues for an analysis of the ‘urban infrastructure regimes’ and ‘experiments’ through which climate change is governed. It is found that climate change experiments serve as a means through which dominant actors articulate and test new ‘low-carbon’ logics for urban infrastructure development. It is argued that experiments work by establishing new circuits, configuring actors in new sets of relations and through these means realising the potential for addressing climate change in the city. At the same time, experiments become sites of conflict, a means through which new forms of <b>urban</b> <b>circulation</b> can be confined and marginalised, leaving dominant energy regimes (relatively) intact...|$|E

In contrast to the burgeoning and more orthodox “policy diffusion” and “policy transfer” literature in political science and sociology, often based on assumptions of rational policy diffusion among nation-states, the authors of Mobile Urbanism build on the emerging interdisciplinary “policy mobility” approach that explores policy formation, transformation, and mobilization as a politicized, power-laden and socially constructed process that can happen at different government scales (Peck and Theodore 2010). Drawing from David Harvey’s (1989) fixity/mobility dichotomy and Doreen Massey’s (1991) idea of “global sense of place,” and looking specifically at urban policy mobilities, McCann and Ward advance an original theoretical framework to study cities in relational and territorial terms by focusing on how local policy is constituted by both connections to other places and local ‘political’ contestations.

Characteristics of <b>urban</b> induced <b>circulations</b> have been studied for surface heat flux perturbation ($H_ 0 $) between $ 28. 93 $Wm$^{- 2 }$ and $ 925. 92 $Wm$^{- 2 }$, and the results have been analyzed against available boundary layer measurements under similar physical conditions. Our primary study shows that urban/rural heat flux anomalies introduce strong oscillations in the convective boundary layer (CBL), and transfers a fraction of the turbulent kinetic energy vertically through internal waves. Such results complement previous investigators' hypothesis that temporal oscillations in urban-induced mesoscale circulations are primarily due to a downscale energy cascade.

O objetivo é avaliar a reciprocidade entre estas instâncias de planejamento que visam organizar a cidade em suas especificidades, mas que devem apresentar uma relação de mutualidade. O escopo do trabalho {{consiste}} na avaliação de um empreendimento de grande porte, situado na cidade de Uberlândia, Minas Gerais, com potencial de gerar interferências de grande impacto na sua área de inserção, tanto em termos ambientais como na circulação urbana que, por sua vez, também interfere no ambiente urbano. É realidade dos grandes e médios centros urbanos os problemas com congestionamento, acidentes de trânsito, poluição sonora, visual e do ar o que gera, perdas de tempo, energia, produtividade e recursos humanos. Assim, grandes empreendimentos são potenciais causadores de impactos no sistema de transporte, no sistema viário imediato e nas proximidades devido à sua demanda frente à oferta dessas infra-estruturas. A amplitude do assunto é passível de vários questionamentos, podendo ser explorado por meio de diversos vieses. Aqui foi avaliado, em específico, a circulação urbana e o sistema de transporte. Adotou-se metodologia proposta por Goldner, em 1994, tratando exclusivament e de shopping centers; da Companhia de Engenharia de Tráfego CET, de 1983 e do Departamento Nacional de Trânsito DENATRAN, em 2001.

40|$|This is an {{introduction}} to a reprint of a major government report by Colin Buchanan, originally published in 1963. It {{is part of a}} series of such reprints currently undertaken by Routledge. Traffic in Towns, also known as the Buchanan Report, is {{regarded as one of the}} most influential planning documents of the twentieth century. The report reflected mounting concern about the impact on Britain’s towns and cities of rapid growth in the ownership and use of motor vehicles. Its purpose was to evaluate policy options for reducing the threat of traffic congestion to <b>urban</b> <b>circulation</b> and qualityof life. Two main conclusions were drawn from the report: firstly, the need for large-scale reconstruction to make Britain’s cities fit for the ‘motor age’, including split-level megastructures and urban motorways;and secondly, the simultaneous need to preserve parts of the city, especially residential areas as car-free zones or ‘environmental areas’. In Britain, successive governments drew back from implementing the full recommendations of the Study Group, despite initial cross-party support. The prohibitive cost of city-centre redevelopment and motorway construction meant a ‘comprehensive’ solution to the problem of urban traffic on Buchanan lines was never attempted. However, local authorities in a variety of British cities, such as Glasgow, Leicester and Leeds took up aspects of the Report. Internationally, too, the Report had a major impact in countries such as Sweden, Italy and Australia. In the longer term, the influence of the Report may be best judged by the incremental changes it setin train such as pedestrianization of city centres, traffic calming, and other measures linked to Buchanan’s concept of ‘environmental areas’. In focusing attention on the effects of mass motorization on the urban environment Traffic in Towns set the terms of debate for a generation, pre-figuring recent discussion about the car and urban sustainability.

This new residence for canons, chaplains and other ecclesiastical collaborators, designed to accommodate the values of residency, common life and discipline, was realized in the tight urban fabric of the medieval city at great cost for the purchase of private real estate which was gradually incorporated into the project according to the predetermined ‘design’. It was defined along lines that remained unchanged until the 19 th century following a policy of adapting structures previously destined to civil habitation and enclosing them in a cloistered environment sheltered from <b>urban</b> <b>circulation</b> with a single monumental entrance towards the church and its portal ‘of the Canons’. In order to understand the duties incumbent upon the canons and chaplains it was necessary to examine the synodal constitutions of previous periods.

The spatio-temporal characteristics of urban CO concentration profiles were obtained. A new approach was put forward {{to examine the}} relationship between urban CO concentration and different wind flow patterns. Rather than relying on the meteorological data from a single weather station, usually adopted in previous studies, four weather stations on the boundary of Hong Kong territory were used in the present study so as to identify 16 different wind flow patterns, among which a typical <b>urban</b> heat island <b>circulation</b> (UHIC) can be distinguished. Higher concentrations were observed to be associated with the flow pattern of an inflow from Lau Fau Shan (LFS) station which is located in the northwest of Hong Kong. This suggests that the ability of dilution for north-to-west wind is relatively weak due to the pollutants carried from outside Hong Kong. The effectiveness of wind speed on the alleviation of urban concentration is dependent on the initial concentration of the approaching wind. The increase of wind speed of north-to-west wind from 0 m/s to 6 m/s has little effect on the reduction of urban CO concentration, especially on the non-roadside stations. By contrast, for the southerly marine wind, pollution concentration decreases sharply with an increase in the wind speed. It was also found that <b>urban</b> heat island <b>circulation</b> (UHIC) is conducive of the accumulation of pollutants, especially at night. There exists a positive correlation between CO concentration and UHI intensity. This correlation is much stronger at night compared to during the day.

40|$|The {{approach}} {{of this study}} was to determine, theoretically, what impact current and future urban land use in the coastal city of Houston, Texas has on the space and time evolution of precipitation on a ‘typical’ summer day. Regional model simulations of a case study for 25  July 2001 were applied to investigate possible effects of urban land cover on precipitation development. Simulations in which Houston urban land cover was included resolved rain cells associated with the sea breeze front and a possible <b>urban</b> <b>circulation</b> on the northwest fringe of the city. Simulations without urban land cover did not capture the initiation and full intensity of the ‘hypothesized’ urban-induced rain cell. The response is given the terminology the ‘urban rainfall effect’ or URE. An urban growth model (UrbanSim) was used to project the urban land-cover growth of Houston, Texas from 1992 to 2025. A regional atmospheric-land surface model was then run with the 2025 urban land-cover scenario. Though we used a somewhat theoretical treatment, our results show the sensitivity of the atmosphere to urban land cover and illustrate how atmosphere – land interactions can affect cloud and precipitation processes. Two urban-induced features, convergence zones along the inner fringe of the city and an urban low-pressure perturbation, appear to be important factors that lead to enhanced rain clouds independently or in conjunction with the sea breeze. Simulations without the city (NOURBAN) produced less cumulative rainfall in the west-northwest Houston area than simulations with the city represented (URBAN). Future urban land-cover growth projected by UrbanSim (URBAN 2025) led to a more expansive area of rainfall, owing to the extended urban boundary and increased secondary outflow activity. This suggests that the future urban land cover might lead to temporal and spatial precipitation variability in coastal urban microclimates. It was beyond the scope of the analysis to conduct an extensive sensitivity analysis of cause – effect relationships, though the experiments provide some clues as to why the rainfall evolution differs. This research demonstrates a novel application of urban planning and weather – climate models. It also raises viable questions concerning future planning strategies in urban environments in consideration of hydroclimate changes. ...|$|E
40|$|Anthropogenic heat (AH) {{emissions}} from human activities {{can change the}} <b>urban</b> <b>circulation</b> and thereby affect the air pollution in and around cities. Based on statistic data, the spatial distribution of AH flux in South China is estimated. With {{the aid of the}} Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF/Chem), in which the AH parameterization is developed to incorporate the gridded AH emissions with temporal variation, simulations for January and July in 2014 are performed over South China. By analyzing the differences between the simulations with and without adding AH, the impact of AH on regional meteorology and air quality is quantified. The results show that the regional annual mean AH fluxes over South China are only 0. 87  W m − 2, but the values for the urban areas of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region can be close to 60  W m − 2. These AH emissions can significantly change the urban heat island and urban-breeze circulations in big cities. In the PRD city cluster, 2  m air temperature rises by 1. 1 ° in January and over 0. 5 ° in July, the planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) increases by 120  m in January and 90  m in July, 10  m wind speed is intensified to over 0. 35  m s − 1 in January and 0. 3  m s − 1 in July, and accumulative precipitation is enhanced by 20 – 40  % in July. These changes in meteorological conditions can significantly impact the spatial and vertical distributions of air pollutants. Due to the increases in PBLH, surface wind speed and upward vertical movement, the concentrations of primary air pollutants decrease near the surface and increase in the upper levels. But the vertical changes in O 3 concentrations show the different patterns in different seasons. The surface O 3 concentrations in big cities increase with maximum values of over 2. 5  ppb in January, while O 3 is reduced at the lower layers and increases at the upper layers above some megacities in July. This phenomenon {{can be attributed to the}} fact that chemical effects can play a significant role in O 3 changes over South China in winter, while the vertical movement can be the dominant effect in some big cities in summer. Adding the gridded AH emissions can better describe the heterogeneous impacts of AH on regional meteorology and air quality, suggesting that more studies on AH should be carried out in climate and air quality assessments...|$|E

There is an overwhelming {{need to help}} our cities regain their character and lure people back into the cities. Landscape architects, urban planners, and architects have developed many design theories {{in response to the}} needs of the city and its inhabitants. The principles and ideas stem from a movement more commonly known as new urbanism (DPZ 2000). This new way of thinking attempts to redirect sprawl back into the creative infill of downtown city spaces. This study looked to several model projects, such as Kentlands, Maryland and Laguna West, California, which offered examples and applications of relevant theories and design principles of new urbanism. Kentlands featured a traditional neighborhood design with a very strong emphasis on walkability. Laguna West offered a different approach to new urbanist thinking and emphasized a transit-oriented development. These two designs included other principles such as mixed-use neighborhoods, a town center, and educational and health facilities. Unfortunately, these new towns were tested in a suburban environment, and did not show applications in an urban context. Hayward and Los Angeles, inCalifornia were examples of urban designs that dealt with the existing urban contexts and historic precedent. These two cities, like Indianapolis, lost many of their historical buildings during the 1960 's urban renewal movement. However, the new plans for each of these cities maintained traces of their historic fabric, patterns, and materials. These case studies served as models for my study. Many of these principles, theories, and concepts throughout my exploration of new urbanism were preserved, and other views of urban design were researched. Jane Jacobs' (1961) reverence for the gritty context of urban life and Peter Calthorpe's (1993) vision for efficient <b>urban</b> <b>circulation</b> were important ideas in my project. David Sucher's (1995) theories about city comforts, such as narrow streets and hidden parking lots provided other examples of urban design. The development of my study was located on nine blocks in a derelict northwest area of downtown Indianapolis. It focused on the contextual fabric, history, and patterns of surrounding areas. It was an attempt to test the applicability of some of the new urbanist principles, theories, and concepts in order to create an ideal urban setting that had the potential to promote social and economic vitality. It was intended to become a case study that can be used as an armature for other "new urbanist" design ideas for urban settings.

40|$|ABSTRACT-The {{variation}} of the differential heating required to depict the diurnal behavior of the urban heat island is established from temperature data obtained in the literature and from other sources. A simple, linear, three-layer model was developed to study {{the response of the}} urban atmosphere to the differential heating in the no-mean-wind case. The only driving force in the model was differential heating. The solutions suggest that the urban atmosphere experiences a short period of upward vertical motion in the early evening (the <b>urban</b> heat island <b>circulation)</b> in response to the positive differential heating at this time and a short period of downward vertical motion in the late morning in response to the negative differential heating at that time. The latter response would prevent diffusion of pollutants in the vertical and would bring an elevated pollution layei over the city to the surface. Therefore, the dynamic response could be responsible for the production of a “critical episode ” in the city. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this study}} we present a {{numerical}} simulation of the urban-breeze circulation observed in Toulouse, South-West of France, during the Intensive Observation Period number 5 (IOP 5, 3 rd and 4 th July 2004) of the CAPITOUL experiment (Feb. 2004 - 2005). The numerical simulation is performed with the non-hydrostatic atmospheric model MesoNH (Lafore et al. 1998) coupled with the urban surface scheme TEB (Masson 2000). Four two-way, gridnested models with horizontal grid resolution of 12 km, 3 km, 1 km and 0. 25 km are used. The diurnal cycle of temperature, the nocturnal heat island and the early morning cool island are reproduced by the model. For the urban-breeze period, between 12. 00 UTC to 18. 00 UTC, the heat island structure and the simulated turbulent fluxes are discussed based on the observed surface energy balance and urban canopy temperature. The numerical simulations confirm {{the presence of a}} convergent circulation at the surface towards the city centre and a divergent counter-current 1500 m above the ground. The intensity of the urban-breeze circulation is of the order of 1. 5 ms 1 and its extension, in the mean wind axis, is two times the diameter of the city. The dynamical perturbation on the ABL due to the roughness of the city is only significant up to 50 m of height, the <b>urban</b> breeze <b>circulation</b> being caused by the pressure gradient due to the UHI-induced thermal effects. An evaluation of the improvement on the ABL thermodynamics representation when going down to 250 m of horizontal resolution instead of 1 km is also presented...|$|R
40|$|Most {{existing}} microscale computational {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) models and mesoscale meteorological models cannot consider multi-scale urban wind flows, as neither can completely {{take into account the}} mesoscale and microscale physics, and their interactions. Here we suggest a CFD model which has good potential for development of the meso-micro scale models for predicting and designing multi-scale urban airflows. The principal idea is to use CFD numerical methods to solve a set of governing equations with appropriate boundary conditions that can govern both major mesoscale and microscale flow characteristics. Based on the coordinate transformation method proposed by Kristóf, Rácz and Balogh (2009), we derived a similar set of governing equations with some improvements and used an existing porous turbulence model for modeling the urban canopy layer. The approach was then successfully implemented using a commercial CFD package (Fluent) for studying <b>urban</b> heat island <b>circulation</b> (UHIC), which is considered {{to be one of the}} most difficult problems in CFD. Our predicted mean quantities agree well with existing data in the literature obtained from large eddy simulations, mesoscale models, and laboratory experiments. Our predicted results also reveal the effects of the different heat fluxes and urban height of a city on UHIC characteristics...|$|R
40|$|As {{the world}} {{population}} continues to grow, food supply is increasingly under pressure. In the recent decades in China, rapid urbanization {{has led to}} a nation wide scarcity of arable land. Without intervention, a national – or even global - food crisis could be imminent. The Vertical Cities Asia competition brief asked for a proposal in which 100 000 people could live, work and play within a 1 km 2 plot in the south of Chengdu. The agriculture and food problem is particularly relevant to the Chengdu region, since this region is responsible for a large share of China’s rice supply throughout history. With the focus on food security, the intention of this proposal is to preserve the existing arable land and revise the current food supply chain, {{but at the same time}} to accommodate the influx of rural migrants - one of the greatest causes for Chengdu’s population growth. Given these preliminaries, the construction of a vertical town with an ultra high density seems inevitable. Reaching a high urban density is often done through the most economic way; skyscrapers in CBD’s, condominium parks dominate existing cities. However, each high-rise becomes a ‘cul-de-sac’ in the <b>urban</b> <b>circulation,</b> where transportation and movement still pressurizes the ground floor space. In order to achieve a true vertical town, circulation should take place on all (elevated) levels. Daily activities and needs are all accommodated within the vertical town, detached from the ground floor. A 72 x 72 x 72 m cube appears to be a suitable module to build up this vertical town. The 72 x 72 x 72 measurement is generic enough to suit a wide range of program, since the floor plan layout is flexible enough fulfil different program requirements. Not only can each cube be dedicated to a program according to the current demands, but it also has the ability to change in function over time. By stacking the cubes on a minimal foot print, the adjacent arable land can be left untouched and continue to be used for food production. Certain rules are set out to dictate the method of stacking and linking. With this set of rules, there will be a large freedom in the town’s growth – horizontally and vertically – while fulfilling daylight, circulation and structural requirements. At the same time, the cubes are stacked in such a way to create maximum surfaces for urban farming. By stimulating local production of food, intermediary parties in the conventional food supply chain can be eliminated; consumers buy directly at the producers. Not only can this lead to a greater awareness of food production, but it will also contribute to the reduction of transportation. In turn, this means less air pollution and less fossil fuel consumption. Hence, sustainability is achieved by the prevention of existing problems, rather than resolving the consequences after the problem has occurred. On the scale of Chengdu, this Agropolis is part of a long-term vision to emphasize the importance of agriculture. The proposal intends to limit Chengdu’s horizontal expansion to only growth in Chengdu’s ‘fingers’, thereby preserving the existing agricultural land in-between. In the end the density issue is tackled in a way that the urbanism itself could occur anywhere in the world, and the entire story about farming and migrations of farmers makes it a specific project for China and the city of Chengdu.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} {{an explosion in}} the science of networks. Much of this research has been stimulated by advances in statistical physics and the study of complex systems – that is, systems that comprise many interrelated components whose interactions produce unpredictable large-scale emergent behavior. Cities are complex systems formed both through decentralized, bottom-up, self-organizing processes as well as through top-down planning interventions. Humans shape their urban ecosystems (the built environment, institutions, cultures, etc.) and are in turn shaped by them. Cities comprise numerous interdependent components that interact through networks – social, virtual, and physical – such as street networks. This dissertation examines urban street networks, their structural complexity (emphasizing density, connectedness, and resilience), and how planning eras and design paradigms shape them. Interventions into a complex system often have unpredictable outcomes, even if the intervention is minor, as effects compound or dampen nonlinearly over time. Such systems’ capacity for novelty, through emergent features that arise from their components’ interactions, also makes them unpredictable. These interactions and the structure of connections within a system are the subject of network science. In cities, the structural characteristics of circulation networks influence how a city’s physical links organize its human dynamics. Urban morphologists have long studied the built form’s complexity and, following from scholars such as Jane Jacobs and Christopher Alexander, various urban design paradigms today speak both directly and indirectly to the value of complexity in the built environment. However, these claims are often made loosely, without formally connecting with theory, implications, or evaluation frameworks. This dissertation develops an interdisciplinary typology of measures for assessing the complexity of urban form and design, particularly emphasizing street network analytic measures. Street network analysis has held a prominent place in network science ever since Leonhard Euler presented his famous Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem in 1736. The past 15 years have been no exception as the growth of interdisciplinary network science has included numerous applications to cities and their street networks. These studies have yielded new understandings of urban form and design, transportation flows and access, and the topology and resilience of urban street networks. However, current limitations of data availability, consistency, and technology have resulted in four substantial shortcomings: small sample sizes, excessive network simplification, difficult reproducibility, and the lack of consistent, easy-to-use research tools. While these shortcomings are by no means fatal, their presence can limit the scalability, generalizability, and interpretability of empirical street network research. To address these challenges, this dissertation presents OSMnx, a new tool to download and analyze street networks and other geospatial data from OpenStreetMap for any study site in the world. OSMnx contributes five capabilities for researchers and practitioners: first, the downloading of political boundaries, building footprints, and elevation data; second, the scalable retrieval and construction of street networks from OpenStreetMap; third, the algorithmic correction of network topology; fourth, the ability to save street networks as shapefiles, GraphML, or SVG files; and fifth, the ability to analyze street networks, including projecting and visualizing networks, routing, and calculating metric and topological measures. These measures include those common in urban design and transportation studies, as well as measures of the structure and topology of the network. This study illustrates the use of OSMnx and OpenStreetMap to consistently conduct street network analysis with extremely large sample sizes, with clearly defined network definitions and extents for reproducibility, and using non-planar, directed graphs. This study collects and analyzes 27, 000 U. S. street networks from OpenStreetMap at metropolitan, municipal, and neighborhood scales – namely, every U. S. city and town, census urbanized area, and Zillow-defined neighborhood. It presents wide-ranging empirical findings on U. S. urban form and street network characteristics, emphasizing measures relevant to graph theory, urban design, and morphology such as structural complexity, connectedness, density, centrality, and resilience. We find that the typical American urban area has approximately 26 intersections/km 2, 2. 8 streets connected to the average node, 160 m average street segment lengths, and a network that is 7. 4 % more circuitous than straight-line streets would be. The typical city has approximately 25 intersections/km 2, 2. 9 streets connected to the average node, 145 m average street segment lengths, and a network that is 5. 5 % more circuitous than straight-line streets would be. The typical Zillow neighborhood has approximately 46 intersections/km 2, 2. 9 streets connected to the average node, 135 m average street segment lengths, and a network that is 4. 4 % more circuitous than straight-line streets would be. At all three scales, 3 -way intersections are by far the most prevalent intersection type across the U. S. We find a strong linear relationship, invariant across scales, between total street length and the number of nodes in a network. This contradicts some previous findings in the literature that relied on smaller sample sizes and different geographic contexts. We also find that most networks demonstrate a lognormal distribution of street segment lengths. However, an obvious exception to lognormal distribution lies in those networks that exhibit substantial uniformity network-wide. At the neighborhood scale, examples include downtown neighborhoods with consistent orthogonal grids, such as that of Portland, Oregon. At the municipal scale, examples include towns in the Great Plains that have orthogonal grids with consistent block sizes, platted at one time, and never subjected to sprawl. These spatial signatures of the Homestead Act, successive land use regulations, urban design paradigms, and planning instruments remain etched into these cities’ urban forms and street networks today. Nebraska’s cities have the lowest circuity, the highest average number of streets per node, the second shortest average street segment length, and the second highest intersection density. These findings illustrate how street networks across the Great Plains developed all at once and grew little afterwards – unlike, for instance, cities in California that were settled in the same era but were later subjected to substantial sprawl. The characteristics of a city street network fundamentally depend on what “city” means: municipal boundaries, urbanized areas, or certain core neighborhoods? The first is a political/legal definition, but it captures the scope of city planning jurisdiction and decision-making for top-down interventions into a street network. The second captures the wider self-organized human system and its emergent built form, but tends to aggregate multiple heterogeneous built forms together into a single unit of analysis. The third captures the nature of the local built environment and lived experience, but at the expense of a broader view of the urban system and metropolitan-scale trip-taking. In short, multiple scales in concert provide planners a clearer view of the urban form and the topological and metric complexity of the street network than any single scale can. The emerging methods of computational data science, visualization, network science, and big data analysis have broadened the scope of urban design’s traditional toolbox. Such methods may yield new insights and rigor in urban form/design research, but they may also promulgate the weaknesses of reductionism and scientism by ignoring the theory, complexity, and qualitative nuance of human experience crucial to urbanism. The tools we use shape the kinds of questions we can even ask about cities. Today, the dissemination of quantitative network science into the social sciences offers an exciting opportunity to study the dynamics and structure of cities and urban form, but paths forward must consider cities as uniquely human complex systems, inextricably bound up with politics, privilege, power relations, and planning decisions. This dissertation comprises six substantive chapters bookended by introductory and concluding chapters. As a whole, the dissertation is divided into two primary parts. The first comprises chapters 2 and 3 and develops the theoretical framework. Chapter 2 introduces the background of the nonlinear paradigm by discussing systems, dynamics, self-similarity, and the nature of prediction in the presence of nonlinearity. These foundations set up the complexity theories of cities and the study of networks presented in chapter 3. This first part of the dissertation emphasizes the dynamics of complex urban systems before we turn our attention to their structure in the second part. <b>Urban</b> <b>circulation</b> networks serve as a physical substrate that underlies and organizes the city’s complex human interactions. Chapter 4 collates various indicators of complexity from multiple research literatures into a typology of measures of the complexity of urban form, emphasizing the scale of urban design practice. In particular, it presents several measures of network complexity and structure that we then operationalize in chapters 5, 6, and 7. Methodologically, chapter 5 introduces OSMnx, a new tool to acquire, construct, correct, visualize, and analyze complex urban street networks. Chapter 6 applies OSMnx empirically in a small case study of street networks in Portland, Oregon. Chapter 7 then expands the empirical application of OSMnx to a large study of 27, 000 urban street networks at various scales across the U. S. These street networks and measures data sets have been shared in a public repository for other researchers to re-purpose...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of two-dimensional katabatic and anabatic flows, and their interaction with an urban heat island centred in a closed valley is presented. Down- and up-slope flows are generated via cooling and heating 20 degrees inclined plates. The urban heat island is simulated by an electric heater centred in the valley. In {{order to understand the}} main features of the circulation established by thermal effects in an initially stably-stratified environment, an advanced Lagrangian particle tracking technique (Hybrid Lagrangian Particle Tracking) is employed. This allows one to obtain the velocity and acceleration of passive tracer particles as the first and second derivatives of a moving spline function that filters the particle trajectory coordinates. Experiments show the dependence of mean quantities and turbulent statistics on different slope heating. Furthermore, the effects of the slope flows on the circulation in a large city located in a narrow valley appear significant. During day-time simulations the <b>urban</b> heat island <b>circulation</b> is opposed by anabatic winds, creating critical situations for pollutant dispersion. During night-time simulations, the katabatic winds increase the city updraft motion. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the long-term urban modification of mean annual conditions of near surface temperature in Nairobi City. Data from four weather stations situated in Nairobi {{were collected from}} the Kenya Meteorological Department for the period from 1966 to 1999 inclusive. The data included mean annual maximum and minimum temperatures, and was first subjected to homogeneity test before analysis. Both linear regression and Mann-Kendall rank test were used to discern the mean annual trends. Results show that the change of temperature over the thirty-four years study period is higher for minimum temperature than maximum temperature. The warming trends began earlier and are more significant at the urban stations than is the case at the sub-urban stations, {{an indication of the}} spread of urbanisation from the built-up Central Business District (CBD) to the suburbs. The established significant warming trends in minimum temperature, which are likely to reach higher proportions in future, pose serious challenges on climate and urban planning of the city.

The influence of the <b>urban</b> breeze <b>circulation</b> on the structure and {{the dynamics of the}} Atmospheric Boundary Layer is analysed by using ground stations, wind profilers (UHF radar), radio soundings and aircraft data. The IOP 5 is a summertime anticyclonic situation with low wind, strong insulation and a deep boundary layer with a sheared wind profile. The temporal and spatial relationship between the Surface Energy Balance (SEB), the diurnal evolution of the surface temperature and the dynamics of the airflow within the mixed layer are studied for urban and rural sites. The vertical and horizontal structure of the urban heat island are analysed from both surface stations and aircraft data. The nocturnal urban heat island reaches 5 C. In the early morning, the city air becomes 1 C cooler than in the countryside (due to efficient heat storage and building shade on the city urban canopy), then warmer again (1 C) in the afternoon, due to negligible evaporation and strong sensible heat flux in the city. The daytime heat island is also present in altitude, being localized above the city centre at 350 m of height (1 C) and advected to leeward at 1100 m of height (0. 5 C). This diurnal heat island is associated to an urban-breeze circulation characterized by a surface convergence towards the city at low levels and a divergence in upper boundary layer. The urban breeze grows in intensity from 2 ms 1 (at 12. 00 UTC) to 5 - 6 ms 1 (at 18. 00 UTC). Aircraft measurements show that the urban breeze horizontal extension is 2 to 3 times larger than the city size...|$|R
