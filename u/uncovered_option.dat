40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. Since 2002, {{there have been}} varying definitions of homeland security. Disagreements about what homeland security is can cause misalignment with budgets and homeland security priorities. The objective of this thesis is to better understand homeland security {{through the lens of}} risk and uncertainty using a metaphorical approach comparing homeland security and financial markets. The usefulness of the financial market metaphor is it allows one to conceptualize homeland security as an investors financial portfolio that is subject to market volatility, market sentiment and mood, investing costs, and market booms and busts. This metaphorical approach for understanding homeland security suggests a nontraditional risk-based antifragile strategy. More than being robust or resilient, which resist or absorb volatility, an antifragile strategy benefits from volatility, adapts, and becomes better. To make something antifragile, individuals and organizations should invest more time in identifying things or processes that are negative rather than focus on the positive. Removing things that are negative can <b>uncover</b> hidden <b>options</b> that can better prepare people or organizations for uncertainty and market volatility. This is a strategy that relies less on definitions of homeland security and is a bottom up, rather than a top down, approach to risk management. Lieutenant Commander, United States Coast Guar...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} 4, 750 mergers from 1963 to 1998 {{to characterize}} the risk and return in risk arbitrage. Results indicate that risk arbitrage returns are positively correlated with market returns in severely depreciating markets but uncorrelated with market returns in f lat and appreciating markets. This suggests that returns to risk arbitrage {{are similar to those}} obtained from selling <b>uncovered</b> index put <b>options.</b> Using a contingent claims analysis that controls for the nonlinear rela-tionship with market returns, and after controlling for transaction costs, we find that risk arbitrage generates excess returns of four percent per year. AFTER THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF A MERGER or acquisition, the target company’s stock typically trades at a discount to the price offered by the acquiring company. The difference between the target’s stock price and the offer price is known as the arbitrage spread. Risk arbitrage, also called merger arbi-trage, refers to an investment strategy that attempts to profit from this spread. If the merger is successful, the arbitrageur captures the arbitrag...|$|R

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{framework for}} jet definition is developed from first principles of physical measurement, quantum field theory, and QCD. A jet definition is found which: is theoretically optimal in regard of both minimization of detector errors and inversion of hadronization; {{is similar to}} a cone algorithm with dynamically negotiated jet shapes and positions found via shape observables that generalize the thrust to any number of axes; involves no ad hoc conventions; allows a fast computer implementation [hep-ph/ 9912415]. The framework offers an array of options for systematic construction of quasi-optimal observables for specific applications. The second edition: ° clarifies, expands and solidifies the arguments behind the formal derivation; ° strengthens consistency of the derivation at the last step → fine-tunes the final criterion → the jet search algorithm is now much simpler, faster and robust [7]; ° <b>uncovers</b> new <b>options</b> not available in conventional schemes.

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three chapters on trading around announcements and resolution of uncertainty. A merger failure announcement is made when either {{or both of the}} acquiring firm and the target firm decide to terminate a merger agreement. In the first chapter, I hypothesize that insider sales prior to the merger failure announcement create severe agency conflicts allowing insiders to take advantage of other shareholders. I analyze the stock performance of target firms during the post-merger failure period and find out that it is negatively correlated with insider sales transactions of the target firm in the period prior to the announcement of merger failure. In addition, the firms that restrict insider sales prior to merger failure announcement have a better chance to get acquired by other firms in future merger offers than those that do not restrict insider sales. In my second chapter, I empirically investigate two related questions on business R&D. First, does R&D create or resolve uncertainty? Second, does uncertainty encourage or discourage business R&D? My testing is consistent with the hypothesis that R&D creates rather than resolves uncertainty. Why then do risk averse business managers undertake R&D? I argue that in creating uncertainty, R&D also creates “shadow options” for supplementary business investment not envisaged by business managers in the original objective for R&D. Rather, managers unexpectedly <b>uncover</b> shadow <b>options</b> in R&D’s inherent knowledge discovery process, which encourages business R&D in the first instance. Consistent with this real options interpretation, I report evidence that volatility encourages R&D. On average, firms experience positive abnormal returns around earnings announcement dates. In my third chapter, I hypothesize that portfolios holding stocks for two days around each of the quarterly earnings announcements and risk-free assets {{for the rest of the}} year are able to significantly reduce risk while still capture a considerable portion of the annual returns relative to those of portfolios holding stocks for the entire year. My empirical results are mostly consistent with the above hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Mesothelioma {{is a rare}} asbestos-linked cancer with an {{expected}} incidence peak between 2015 – 2030. Therapies remain ineffective, thus developing and testing novel treatments is important for both oncologists and researchers. Areas covered: After describing mesothelioma and the shortcomings of current therapies, the article discusses numerous therapies in turn such as immunotherapy (passive and active), gene therapy (such as suicide gene therapy) and targeted therapy such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The bases for different therapies and clinical trials at different phases are also described. The article concludes by detailing possible reasons for therapy failure. Expert opinion: Despite the many attempts to <b>uncover</b> new therapeutic <b>options,</b> mesothelioma is still an orphan disease, complicated by {{factors such as the}} inflammatory microenvironment and low mutational load. Our opinion is that uncovering the biological mechanisms behind mesothelioma development will assist therapy development. The lack of efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors and modest anti-angiogenic activity indicates a less relevant role for tumor cell proliferation and neoangiogenesis, thus the shortcut of treating mesothelioma with therapies from other cancers may be unsound. Conversely, many lines of evidence indicate that focussing on the survival mechanisms that tumor cells exploit may yield better therapeutics, particularly nutrition and cellular machinery...|$|R
40|$|Diploma {{thesis is}} focused on the individualization in {{providing}} diets in three homes for the elderly in the South Bohemian region. The main goal of the qualitative research was to <b>uncover</b> what the <b>options</b> of the homes in providing the diets are, where the boundaries and the limits of the individualized care are and what the clients' attitude toward individualization is. Results of the research show that the homes for the elderly can accommodate just to the basic requirements of the client, such as replacing unpopular dish or side dish for another one. Medical restrictions of the clients in preparation and serving their food are taken into account. The homes don't have the capacity for greater individualization. Another problem is the lack of staff. The homes are limited by legislation rather than by their financial budget. Clients' conservative and conformal attitudes are not empowering managers to expand some options or to change the system. The concept of the individualization is interpreted by the homes for the elderly in different ways. In practice, they rather just try to individualize the diets, than truly doing it. It turned out that individualization is a complex phenomenon and the extend of its fulfillment depends mainly on organizations' overall approach to the clients and on the clients' [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable {{design is}} a buzzword {{in the field}} of architecture, yet very few houses built in Western Australia last year had an {{environmentally}} friendly focus. Through much debate and research, designers now have a thorough understanding of the environmental impact ofhousing (Kibert, 2005; Roaf, 2001; Yeang, 1995). The result is that architects worldwide are now offering a more sustainable housing model. These houses are expensive and look very different to the popular project homes. Despite this environmental awareness, the homes Western Australians build appear to be growing larger, with little regard for their future sustainability. There is reluctance among Australians to accept an entirely new aesthetic of domestic architecture. This project explores the problems with existing housing options in Western Australia in 2010. It examines the most popular form of homes in this state, the project home, through a case study of a potential re-design from the perspective of an interior designer. The housing trends analysed in the case study are looked at in terms of their sustainability and meaning within society. Through creative practice, the design of the case-study project home is explored in order to <b>uncover</b> more sustainable <b>options</b> that still retain many of the design and spatial elements of the existing model...|$|R
40|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) {{is a technique}} that enables imaging {{of the distribution of}} radiolabeled tracers designed to track biochemical and molecular processes in the body after intravenous injection or inhalation. New strategies for the use of radiolabeled tracers hold potential for imaging gene expression in the brain during development and following interventions. In addition, PET may be key in identifying the physiological consequences of gene mutations associated with mental retardation. The development of high spatial resolution microPET scanners for imaging of rodents provides a means for longitudinal study of transgenic mouse models of genetic disorders associated with mental retardation. In this review, we describe PET methodology, illustrate how PET can be used to delineate biochemical changes during brain development, and provide examples of how PET has been applied to study brain glucose metabolism in Rett syndrome, serotonin synthesis in autism, and GABA A receptors in Angelman's syndrome and Prader–Willi syndrome. Future application of PET scanning in the study of mental retardation might include measurements of brain protein synthesis in fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis complex, two common conditions associated with mental retardation in which cellular mechanisms involve dysregulation of protein synthesis.

40|$|The Nordic {{hedge fund}} {{industry}} {{has experienced a}} massive growth in assets under management of approximately 370 % between 2005 and 2016. The increased interest for hedge funds as an investment vehicle may suggest that investors believe that Nordic hedge fund managers are able to deliver risk-adjusted excess returns. In this paper, we aim to provide {{a better understanding of}} the risk-return profile of Nordic hedge funds. Using traditional linear risk factor models, we find that Nordic hedge funds apparently creates statistical significant pre-fee alphas between 6 % and 8 % during the period between January 2005 and December 2016. However, empirical studies suggest that hedge fund returns exhibit significant left-tail risk and that the traditional mean-variance framework fails to capture the true risk profile of hedge funds. Furthermore, studies show that hedge fund returns resembles the returns of an <b>uncovered</b> index put <b>option.</b> This further support our belief that traditional linear risk factor models are inappropriate in order to account for the performance of hedge funds and gives motivation to apply alternative methods when studying the risk and return for Nordic hedge funds. We show that a mechanic put-writing strategy largely accounts for the net-of-fee alphas of Nordic hedge funds, but not the pre-fee alphas. However, this result hinges critically on the accuracy of the NHX reporting process. A small degree of return smoothing or presence of backfill bias or survivorship bias could potentially leave the pre-fee alphas insignificant or even negative. These findings enhances our understanding of hedge funds in aggregate, and they may provide the basis for a more sober evaluation of Nordic hedge funds as investment vehicles...|$|R
40|$|A unified {{analytical}} pricing framework with {{involvement of}} the shot noise random process has been introduced and elaborated. Two exactly solvable new models have been developed. The first model {{has been designed to}} value options. It is assumed that asset price stochastic dynamics follows a Geometric Shot Noise motion. A new arbitrage-free integro-differential option pricing equation has been found and solved. The put-call parity has been proved and the Greeks have been calculated. Three additional new Greeks associated with market model parameters have been introduced and evaluated. It has been shown that in diffusion approximation the developed option pricing model incorporates the well-known Black-Scholes equation and its solution. The stochastic dynamic origin of the Black-Scholes volatility has been <b>uncovered.</b> The new <b>option</b> pricing model has been generalized based on asset price dynamics modeled by the superposition of Geometric Brownian motion and Geometric Shot Noise. To model stochastic dynamics of a short term interest rate, the second model has been introduced and developed based on Langevin type equation with shot noise. A new bond pricing formula has been obtained. It has been shown that in diffusion approximation the developed bond pricing formula goes into the well-known Vasicek solution. The stochastic dynamic origin of the long-term mean and instantaneous volatility of the Vasicek model has been uncovered. A generalized bond pricing model has been introduced and developed based on short term interest rate stochastic dynamics modeled by superposition of a standard Wiener process and shot noise. Despite the non-Gaussianity of probability distributions involved, all newly elaborated models have the same degree of analytical tractability as the Black-Scholes model and the Vasicek model. Comment: V 2 includes 62 pages and 4 Tables. Generalized Greeks have been introduced and calculated in Sec. 7. 3. Table 4 has been added to display the generalized Greeks.

40|$|Myopia (near-sightedness) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common ocular {{disorders}} in humans. Due to the dramatic increases in prevalence of myopia worldwide, especially in children and young adults, myopia has also become a significant public health problem, both socially and economically. While the prevalence and severity of myopia continue to increase, effective therapeutic interventions for myopia remain limited. Currently, management of myopia is largely limited to traditional optical corrections - spectacles, contact lenses, and refractive surgery - which correct distance vision but have no effect on myopia progression. While slowed myopia progression has been reported in clinical studies using the contact lens-based, corneal reshaping therapy and atropine, a pharmaceutical agent, these approaches come with limitations and in the latter case, significant ocular side-effects. Uncontrolled progression may lead to high "degenerative" myopia, for which posterior scleral reinforcement surgery remains the only treatment option and a last resort directed at preserving vision. Thus there is a clear need for new myopia control treatments. Understanding more about the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying myopic eye growth has the potential to <b>uncover</b> novel treatment <b>options.</b> This dissertation presents results from three investigations into the role of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in eye growth regulation, focusing on molecular and cellular mechanisms, and using both in vivo animal models and in vitro cell culture models. In the first in vivo study (Chapter 2), we investigated expression of candidate genes in chick RPE of imposing short-term optical defocus. Specifically, gene expression levels of the three bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP- 2, 4 & 7) were examined after 2 and 48 h of treatment, with negative and positive lenses used to impose defocus of opposite sign. These growth factors were observed to be differentially and bidirectionally expressed in RPE, expression generally increasing with imposed myopia, which is associated with ocular growth inhibition. Because eyes had little chance to change their dimensions with such short-term lens treatments, these genes are assumed to play important roles in the onset and early phase of defocus-induced ocular growth changes. For this reason, these genes represent potential targets for molecular-based myopia treatments. In the second study (Chapter 3), high-through gene expression profiling was employed to examine changes in gene expression in chick RPE with long-term imposed hyperopic defocus, which resulted in eyes being longer than normal and highly myopic. This DNA microarray screening revealed changes in the expression of many genes, including BMPs, noggin (NOG), dopamine receptor D 4 (DRD 4), retinoic acid receptor, beta (RARB), and retinal pigment epithelium-derived rhodopsin homolog (RRH). Some of these genes showed increased expression while others showed decreased expression. It is plausible that some may be linked the ocular pathological complications seen in myopia, while others may be linked to ocular growth regulation, the imposed visual conditions resulting in sustained, increased ocular growth. The third and final study (Chapter 4), addressed the possibility of an RPE site for the anti-myopia action of apomorphine (APO), a dopamine receptor agonist, observed in animal studies. We further investigated the possibility that TGF-â secretion from RPE mediates this inhibitory growth effect. APO applied to cultured human fetal RPE cells was found to alter the secretion of both TGFâ 1 and TGFâ 2, which was biased towards the basal (choroidal) side. These growth factors also exhibited constitutive polarized secretion, albeit biased in the opposite direction to APO-induced paracrine secretion. The results for APO are consistent with its observed inhibitory (anti-myopia) effects in vivo and offer the RPE as a possible site of action. In summary, the research reported in this dissertation provides evidence that RPE plays an important role in postnatal eye growth regulation, (including myopic growth), as a conduit for relaying growth modulatory retinal signals to choroid/sclera. Genes and molecules identified in these studies offer potential directions for novel anti-myopia treatments, with the RPE being a potential target for the same...|$|R
