500|$|According {{to one of}} her biographers, Diana Mandache, Marie {{published}} 34 {{books and}} short stories, both in Romanian and English, during her lifetime. This included her critically acclaimed autobiography, The Story of My Life, published by Cassell in London, in three volumes. The book was reviewed by Virginia Woolf, who felt it was too familiarizing of the royal family. She stated that [...] "suppose that among the autumn books of 2034 is Prometheus Unbound, by George the Sixth, or Wuthering Heights, by Elizabeth the Second, what will be the effect upon their loyal subjects? Will the British Empire survive? Will Buckingham Palace look as solid then as it does now? Words are dangerous things, let <b>us</b> <b>remember.</b> A republic might be brought into being by a poem." ...|$|E
500|$|The main {{building}} of the monastic compound is Surp Astvatsatsin (Holy Mother of God) church. The exact date of the {{building of the}} church is unknown. It is generally regarded as an 11th-13th century complex, but the current church has been built on an earlier foundation. Kirakos Gandzaketsi mentions that Ivane Zakarian was buried in the church in 1227. Stepanos Orbelian refers to the church in 1216. Modern researchers date the murals within the church to 1205–1216. Princess Mariam, the daughter of Gurgen II (Kyurikeh II) made a record in 1188 {{on the back of a}} khachkar found in a place called Ayor adjacent to Akhtala which refers to the construction of the Holy Mother of God church at Akhtala. The inscription on the khackar states the following: [...] "I, the daughter if Kyurikeh, Mariam, erected Surp Astvatsatsin at Pghndzahank, those who honor <b>us</b> <b>remember</b> us in their prayers." [...] In 1185 Mariam had constructed the narthex of the main church in Haghpat. According to some local lore, the church was built in the 7th century by Byzantine emperor of Armenian extraction, Heraclius. Another legend assumes that the church was built in the 5th century by Georgian King Vakhtang I Gorgasali. There is no reasonable evidence to support either story. [...] The church used to contain the cross which according to folklore was used by John the Baptist to baptise Jesus Christ. Vasak, the father of Prince Prosh, is said to have given this relic to Ivane Zakarian who later sold it for a large sum to the monastery of Noravank in Syunik.|$|E

[...] The politics of the Soviet Union did not allow him to work as a historian, so Meri found work as a dramatist in the Vanemuine, the oldest theatre of Estonia, and later on as a producer of radio plays in the Estonian broadcasting industry. Several of his films were released to great critical acclaim.|$|E
2500|$|Serial recall is {{the ability}} to recall items or events in the order in which they occurred. [...] The ability of humans to store items in memory and recall them is {{important}} to the use of language. [...] Imagine recalling the different parts of a sentence, but in the wrong order. [...] The ability to recall in serial order has been found not only in humans, but in a number of non-human primate species and some non-primates. [...] Imagine mixing up the order of phonemes, or meaningful units of sound, in a word so that [...] "slight" [...] becomes [...] "style." [...] Serial-order also helps <b>us</b> <b>remember</b> the order of events in our lives, our autobiographical memories. [...] Our memory of our past appears to exist on a continuum on which more recent events are more easily remembered in order.|$|E

"Why {{should you}} pack a jury against <b>us?</b> <b>Remember,</b> my lord, {{you belong to}} that liberal and truly enlightened party called 'Whigs;' {{it is only a}} 'Tory,' you know, who packs;—and remember, also, that {{although}} I deny the lawfulness of your 'law' and your law-courts altogether, and hold a trial for sedition before a packed jury in Ireland quite as constitutional a proceeding as a trial before an unpacked one, yet your lordship cannot take this view of the matter. Your case is that there is law in the land—that we have broken that law, and are to be tried by that law. Remember, therefore, all the fine things that your jurists and statesmen have said and written about the great palladium of British liberty and so forth: remember how the learned Sir William Blackstone hath delivered himself on this point;—how that 'the founders of the English laws have with excellent forecast contrived that the truth of every accusation, whether preferred in the shape of indictment, information, or appeal, should be confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of his (the accused person's) equals and neighbours, indifferently chosen, and superior to all suspicion.' A trial for 'sedition' here is a mere political voting, and as your faction (that is, the English faction,) have held the sole appointment of all the officers and clerks employed in that business, they have always been able by stealing lists, or juggling and falsifying cards, and numbers, to secure twelve men who will vote for the Castle, and find anyone guilty whom the Castle does not love..." ...|$|E
