Unlike the costs of a copper access networks, those of an NGA are not yet sunk; hence fixed monopoly suppliers need an incentive to invest. This need is likely to influence the regulator's <b>unbundling</b> and <b>access</b> pricing regime, including application of the 'ladder of investment', which encourages competitors {{to develop their own}} infrastructure. This paper considers how the ladder is affected by NGAs, taking account of both the changed network architecture of NGAs, which may remove the <b>unbundled</b> local loop <b>access</b> point, and problems associated with providing an incentive to take the copper network out of use.

Scientific American has the right concerns and objectives: ensuring that the United States remains a technological leader and that its broadband market is competitive. However, {{a closer look at}} the facts, as explained, for example, by the FCC‟s National Broadband Plan, reveals a more nuanced story that does not support their confident policy proposals. The editors ‟ incomplete understanding of the industry causes Scientific American to ignore the real policy issues the United States must face to improve broadband adoption, use, and innovation. In particular, the most important policy priority now is to ensure that wireless broadband continues its remarkable advances by making more spectrum available for high-value uses like broadband. The National Broadband Plan emphasized this point when it recommended quickly making an additional 500 MHz of spectrum available for such uses. Arguments that focus on a narrow view of how Americans will connect to the broadband network distract us from the important policy work that nearly everyone agrees is crucial for our broadband future.

50|$|Broadband {{open access}} has also brought on many {{questions}} of how services to competition is offered, such as <b>unbundled</b> <b>access</b> services {{sold to the}} new company.

The concept is like what service providers offer their own customers and having television, voice, and Internet service bundled into one package. Any competitor may rent office space in an incumbent's central office, place equipment to interconnect with their network, or purchase other related services. The company can offer the same deal to a competing company requesting use of their network and facilities. The new entrant has a right to purchase access to the incumbent on an unbundled basis. Getting unbundled services means the new entrant has the opportunity to invest in its own network and therefore spend less on buying everything wholesale.

40|$|Regulation of {{telecommunication}} and {{deployment of}} broadband 1 This memorandum explores {{the question whether}} regulation in telecommunications encourages or hampers {{the development of new}} technologies. Contrary to other network industries, the telecommunications industry is more and more characterized by several, competing networks, such as cable, copper, and wireless. Regulation is, however, still needed as in several components of telecommunications sources of market power remain. The key issue in the regulation of access to a network is dealing with the possible trade-off between static efficiency and dynamic efficiency. Favourable conditions for access to the network contribute to allocative efficiency and productive efficiency, but can negatively affect incentives for investments in upgrading of existing infrastructures and developing new ones. In the Netherlands, regulation of the telecommunication industry is designed to enhance competition between alternative infrastructures without affecting the technology choice of both incumbents and entrants. In the market for <b>unbundled</b> <b>access</b> to the local loop and the market for high quality wholesale access, a trade-off exists between static efficiency an...|$|E

We show for 16 European countries over the period 1998 - 2007 that higher electricity end-user prices in a country subsequently lead to higher investments in the capital stock, i. e. in generation, distribution and transmission assets. Moreover, there is a trade-off between vertical economies and competition. Ownership <b>unbundling</b> and forced <b>access</b> to the incumbent transmission grid increase competition but come at the cost of lost vertical economies.
