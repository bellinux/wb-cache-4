5|$|Quackenbush was an {{offensive}} defenceman who carried the puck up the ice, making <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> stick handling, passing skills {{and ability to}} read the play.

5|$|The English and Danish editions {{differed}} in several significant ways.

It also contained considerably less harsh language towards Boas and others with whom he disagreed. Curiously, the English edition did not contain the transformational sequences inspired by D'Arcy Thompson, though Heilmann still briefly acknowledged the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> methods in reconstructing his Proavis.|$|E
5|$|The {{inaugural address}} was a {{detailed}} {{statement of the}} Whig agenda, essentially a repudiation of Jackson and Van Buren's policies.
