50|$|The Pumpe Düse {{design was}} a {{reaction}} to the development of high-pressure common rail fuel injection systems by competitors - an attempt by Volkswagen Group to create an in-house technology of comparable performance that would not require any royalties to be paid. While Pumpe Düse engines had a significantly higher injection pressure than older engines, they are slightly less refined when compared to the very latest common rail and, with the original solenoid-operated <b>unit</b> <b>injectors,</b> were not able to control injection timing as precisely (a major factor in improving emissions).

50|$|From 1984 {{until late}} 1995, the DT engines used a Bosch pump-line-nozzle (PLN) {{mechanical}} {{direct fuel injection}} system. 1984 through 1992 DTs used a Bosch MW style pump, while the 1993-1995s used a Bosch P style pump, and starting what was called New Generation Diesel engine design, which {{is still the same}} basic block design. Mechanical injection was still utilized in trucks up into the 1997 year, but this is rare. In 1994, due to tightening emissions regulations, the engines were redesigned to use electronically controlled unit direct fuel injection. From 1994 to 2004, the engines used HEUI (Hydraulically actuated Electronically controlled <b>Unit</b> Injection) <b>injectors,</b> co-developed by Navistar and Caterpillar. http://www.internationaldelivers.com/assets/pdf/dyk267.pdf From 2004 to 2009, the engines use International's Electro-Hydraulic Generation Two (G2) <b>unit</b> <b>injectors.</b>|$|R

Volkswagen introduces three and four-cylinder turbodiesel engines, with Bosch-developed electronically controlled <b>unit</b> <b>injectors.</b> Smart presented the first common rail three-cylinder diesel engine used in a passenger car (the Smart City Coupé).|$|R
2500|$|The {{engine is}} a uniflow design with four poppet-type exhaust valves in the {{cylinder}} head. For maintenance, a power assembly, {{consisting of a}} cylinder head, cylinder liner, piston, piston carrier, and piston rod, can be individually and relatively easily and quickly replaced. The block is made from flat, formed and rolled structural steel members and steel forgings welded into a single structure (a [...] "weldment").

Each bank of cylinders has an overhead camshaft which operates the exhaust valves and the <b>unit</b> <b>injectors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The 6-71 is a {{two stroke}} diesel engine. As the engine will not {{naturally}} aspirate, air is {{provided to the}} engine via a roots-type supercharger.

5000|$|Diesel fuel {{has better}} {{lubrication}} properties than petrol as well. Indeed, in <b>unit</b> <b>injectors,</b> the fuel is employed for three distinct purposes: injector lubrication, injector cooling and injection for combustion. Although spark-ignition engines and their fuel systems {{do not require}} as much lubricity, the higher lubricity of diesel fuel aids in providing lubrication {{to the top of}} the cylinders and piston rings where it is most needed to resist the high heat, loads and friction resulting from compression and combustion. Because diesel fuels are actually very light oils, excess fuel in the cylinders and contaminating the crankcase oil is more easily tolerated by diesel engines.|$|R
