Arriving on 12 May, she sailed west again on 1 June {{as a unit}} of Task Group 51.18 (TG 51.18), the reserve force for Operation Forager, the conquest of the Marianas. On D-Day plus 1, 16 June, Saufley and the other escorts shepherded their charges into the transport <b>unloading</b> <b>area</b> west of Saipan. Saufley was then reassigned to call fire support duties. For the next month, she continued call fire support, screening, and shore bombardment operations in the Saipan-Tinian area. On 20 July, Saufley moved south for the invasion of Guam. Here, {{the destroyer}} provided call fire support for the assault troops. She returned to Tinian on the 23d and supported the landings there on 24 July. For the next week, she provided gunfire support and served on radar picket duty.|$|E

2500|$|Sky Screamer, a first-generation Intamin Freefall ride, was {{constructed}} in the Plaza de Fiesta section and opened in 1983. Consisting of a tower reaching [...] in height and a horizontal braking runout, Sky Screamer had an L-shaped appearance. It featured eight uniquely designed gondolas, each holding four riders. The gondolas used one set of wheels to go up the lift and down the drop (4 large wheels at each back corner), but used a different set in the transfer and loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>area</b> of the ride (smaller rollers located {{on the bottom of}} the gondola). Gondolas were lifted upward through a shaft in the tower's center by a lift chain. Once at the top, the gondola was disengaged from the lift chain and pushed forward into the drop position. The gondola was released into freefall following the sounding of a loud klaxon (which was audible throughout sections of the park and often lured visitors to the ride). A pair of guide rails ran downward along the outside of the tower before curving into the horizontal braking runout. The freefall drop into the horizontal curve applied a g-force of 4.5 on the riders. In late 1983, 50% more anti-rollback devices were installed. The additional anti-rollbacks were staggered on each side of the lift. These modifications were intended to improve stopping ability in wet conditions and were a response to a non-fatal accident on a similar ride at another park. In 1986, the ride's [...] "G-Block" [...] was moved farther down the horizontal braking runout. The end of [...] "H-Block" [...] was extended to the beginning of the station conveyors in 1994. Sky Screamer was dismantled on November 2, 1997.|$|E

40|$|Cities {{attract more}} and more {{residents}} from rural areas and small towns. This ongoing trend of urbanization means that large cities grow even larger and in pace with growth the city’s need for transportation of goods increase. Freight transport is necessary to keep the city alive, {{not only for the}} supply of goods but also for the disposal of waste. Freight transport creates problems in urban areas. Large, difficult to maneuver trucks move close to people strolling in the city center, which lead to an increased risk for accidents. The trucks also contribute to noise and air pollution, which results in a less healthy urban environment. The large amount of stakeholders in city logistics, such as pedestrians, the environment, distribution traffic and so on, contribute to the complexity that municipalities have to manage. This study aims at developing a proposal on how a municipality can contribute to streamline the distribution of goods in a large city (over 200000 residents) in such way that negative effects of transport can be reduced without inhibiting the economic development of the city. The research strategy of this study has been a case study, more specifically the “last mile” distribution. The data collection has partly been conducted through observations in the area surrounding Hötorgsfaret in Stockholm where the traffic to and from the underground loading/unloading area and the loading zones have been observed. Other than the observations, shorter interviews with drivers, store employees and car park attendants as well as longer interviews with representatives from road carriers have been carried out. During the time at the City of Stockholm, the writers have participated at several meetings, seminars and workshops to further expand their knowledge about city distribution. The research approach for the study has been abductive with a starting point in the theoretical areas, city logistics and goods reception. The study shows that the distributors of goods run in to a number of problems {{during the course of a}} day. The problems start as soon as the truck leaves the terminal or supplier. There are long traffic queues that make the drive into the city time consuming. Once in the city illegally parked cars create major problems for the distribution trucks. The primal problem is parked cars in the unloading zones, but cars parked to close to an intersection also create problems. Underground <b>unloading</b> <b>areas</b> have proven to be a good solution since the distribution trucks is able to escape the traffic, but even underground <b>unloading</b> <b>areas</b> has its problems. The main problem with these is that the headroom is to low, but other problems such as inadequate signage has emerged. To be able to contribute to streamlining the distribution of goods a municipality can use a number of different policy measures. These are divided into four categories: economic, knowledge-based, legal and societal policy measures. The study shows that municipalities, to contribute to a more efficient distribution of goods can review the possibility of delivering goods at night, consider giving commercial traffic access to the public transport lanes, make sure the parking control functions in a satisfactory manner, promote shared receptions of goods and underground <b>unloading</b> <b>areas</b> in new construction projects.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{sensitive}} area of the two-port resonator configuration on the mass sensitivity of a Rayleigh surface acoustic wave (R-SAW) sensor was investigated theoretically, and verified in experiments. A theoretical model utilizing a 3 -dimensional finite element method (FEM) approach was established to extract the coupling-of-modes (COM) parameters in the absence and presence of mass loading covering the electrode structures. The COM model was used to simulate the frequency response of an R-SAW resonator by a P-matrix cascading technique. Cascading the P-matrixes of <b>unloaded</b> <b>areas</b> with mass loaded areas, the sensitivity for different sensitive areas was obtained by analyzing the frequency shift. The performance of the sensitivity analysis was confirmed by the measured responses from the silicon dioxide (SiO 2) deposited on different sensitive areas of R-SAW resonators.

50|$|The Omnimover {{system was}} created by Roger E. Broggie and Bert Brundage to provide a ride system capable of {{providing}} passengers with a motion picture type experience by controlling the line of sight. This concept also allows the designers {{to be able to}} place infrastructure elements of the attraction, such as lighting and projectors, behind the vehicles without concern for having the illusions of the attraction revealed to the riders. The system consists of a chain of vehicles operating on a track, usually hidden beneath the floor. The chain of vehicles maintains constant motion at a specific speed (usually about 2 ft per second) throughout the entire course of the attraction. To facilitate boarding and disembarking from the vehicles, a conveyor belt moving at approximately the same speed as the ride vehicles parallels the track at the loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>areas.</b> Passengers step from the moving belt into the vehicle or vice versa.|$|R
