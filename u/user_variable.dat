40|$|Over {{the past}} seven years, the {{portability}} of the GFDL SKYHI general circulation model has greatly increased. Modifications to the source code have allowed SKYHI to be run on the GFDL Cray Research PVP machines, the TMC CM- 5 machine at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and more recently on the GFDL 40 -processor Cray Research T 3 E system. At the same time, changes {{have been made to}} the model to make it more usable and flexible. Because of the reduction of the human resources available to manage and analyze scientific experiments, it is no longer acceptable to consider only the optimization of computer resources when producing a research code; one must also consider the availability and cost of the people necessary to maintain, modify and use the model as an investigative tool, and include these factors in defining the form of the model code. The new SKYHI model attempts {{to strike a balance between}} the optimization of the use of machine resources (CPU time, memory, disc) and the optimal use of human resources (ability to understand code, ability to modify code, ability to perturb code to do experiments, ability to run code on different platforms). Two of the key features that make the new SKYHI code more usable and flexible are the archiving package and the <b>user</b> <b>variable</b> block. The archiving package is used to manage the writing of all archive files, which contain data for later analysis. The model-supplied <b>user</b> <b>variable</b> block allows the easy inclusion of any new variables needed for particular experiments...|$|E

A zinc bromide (Zn/Br{sub 2 }) battery was chosen since it is a good candidate as an EV battery and has a large number of <b>user</b> <b>variable</b> parameters that affect its performance. The flexibility of the system arises {{from the fact that the}} system can be programmed to do a wide variety of jobs. The use of real time interrupts and other features makes the system safe for use along with the battery systems. Test data indicates that real time control of the different parameters can increase the performance of the battery by 15 %. In addition to optimizing the performance of the battery the control system incorporates essential safety features...|$|E

40|$|Sustainable road {{transportation}} {{has become a}} challenge particularly in the developing countries. Literature suggests that the ability of the transport system to respond to the mobility needs of people and goods is hampered by a continuous increase in traffic demand as a result of higher levels of urbanization, population growth, changes in population density and motorization. These factors result in traffic crashes, traffic congestion and consequent increase in travel times, fuel consumption and carbon emissions, which reduce the efficiency of mobility systems and make it unsustainable. Certain measures such as traffic control and management, congestion warning, road conditions warning, route guidance and use of eco- friendly and green vehicles are being considered to meet the challenges. Arguments have emerged that Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are important to meet these challenges of achieving virtually traffic crash-free, clean and efficient mobility. This requires the development of an integrated communication architecture that provides a common frame for the road and traffic infrastructure, environment and vehicle systems to work together through Information Communication Technology (ICT) system. Therefore, this investigation explored the various ITS that are relevant to {{road transportation}} in the context of developing countries; examined the perception of road users on the use of ITS and its impacts on travel behavior; and developed a conceptual futuristic communication ITS architecture by integrating land use, road, traffic, human and environmental parameters with ICT for sustainable road transportation in developing countries. The study was conducted based on critical review of relevant literature and industrial innovations to examine the ITS system(s) applicable to developing countries. A survey was conducted in two cities of a developing country, India, to observe the perception of people, particularly road users on the use of ITS and its impacts on their travel. This was followed by development of a conceptual ITS architecture by integrating land use, activity, traffic, road infrastructure, vehicle, ICT, road <b>user</b> <b>variable</b> and indicators related to sustainable road transportation. Findings suggest that appropriate ITS with the use of ICT, can provide acceptable effective real time information regarding the road and traffic conditions, which will enable the road users in their journey planning, to avoid unwarranted incidents and moreover enhance safe and efficient mobility in the roads of developing countries.

This study measures the health system responsiveness and the factors affecting responsiveness in Iran health system. Methods: World Health Survey (WHS) questionnaire was used {{to collect data on}} a two-stage cluster sampling in 17 th District of Tehran in 2003. Of a sample of 773, 677 and 299 individuals who respectively had outpatient or inpatient services utilization responded to the responsiveness module of WHS questionnaire. Result: More than 90 % of respondents believed that responsiveness issues were very important. Performance of outpatient services was better than hospital services in terms of responsiveness. "Prompt attention " and "quality of basic amenities " received low score for outpatient services. Service <b>user</b> <b>variables</b> had no significant effect on respon-siveness, while type of centers was significantly related to responsiveness. Principal component analysis found three factors for both outpatient and inpatient services that explained 62 % and 61 % of total variances respectfully. Conclusion: Iran health system should pay more attention to responding non-medical expectations of service users.

It identified obstacles to teachers 2 ̆ 7 uses of RD research and methods to bridge RD research and teachers 2 ̆ 7 practices. Two theoretical frameworks underpinned the study. The knowledge utilization framework consisted of eight stages of knowledge use (reception, search/find, cognition, reference, effort, adoption, implementation, and impact), and three categories of obstacles to knowledge use (supply, demand, and context). A critical perspective also informed the study 2 ̆ 7 s methods, analyses, and implications. A mixed methodology was employed by way of: (a) a pre-pilot study which tested the efficacy of the knowledge utilization framework; (b) a narrative synthesis of RD research; (c) a pilot study of an online questionnaire; (d) an online teacher questionnaire; and (e) focus groups. Ten Ontario elementary school teachers participated in the pre-pilot and pilot studies; 204 elementary school teachers completed the questionnaire and eight teachers took part in focus groups. Results revealed underutilization of RD research across the eight stages of knowledge use. Variables within the three categories of obstacles contributed to the underuse of RD research. Research/researcher and <b>user</b> <b>variables</b> correlated most strongly with research uses; <b>user</b> <b>variables</b> were most predictive. Specialized teachers reported greater research use than intermediate grade teachers. Methods to bridge RD research and practice related to research, researcher, dissemination and context factors.
