However, an apparent complete lack of appendages (aside from the antenna-like structures) makes B. constrictas placement within Arthropoda equally unlikely.

50|$|A {{tunicate}} is {{a marine}} invertebrate animal, {{a member of}} the subphylum Tunicata, {{which is part of the}} Chordata, a phylum which includes all animals with dorsal nerve cords and notochords. The subphylum was at one time called <b>Urochordata,</b> and the term urochordates is still sometimes used for these animals. Some tunicates live as solitary individuals, but others replicate by budding and become colonies, each unit being known as a zooid. They are marine filter feeders with a water-filled, sac-like body structure and two tubular openings, known as siphons, through which they draw in and expel water. During their respiration and feeding, they take in water through the incurrent (or inhalant) siphon and expel the filtered water through the excurrent (or exhalant) siphon. Most adult tunicates are sessile, and are permanently attached to rocks or other hard surfaces on the ocean floor; others, such as salps, doliolids and pyrosomes, swim in the pelagic zone of the sea as adults. Various species are commonly known as sea squirts, sea pork, sea livers, or sea tulips.|$|E
40|$|Achieving {{a better}} {{comprehension}} {{of the evolution of}} species has always been an important matter for evolutionary biologists. The deuterostome phylogeny has been described for many years, and three phyla are distinguishable: Echinodermata (including sea stars, sea urchins, etc&# 8230;), Hemichordata (including acorn worms and pterobranchs), and Chordata (including urochordates, cephalochordates and extant vertebrates). Inside the Chordata phylum, the position of vertebrate species is quite unanimously accepted. Nonetheless, the position of urochordates in regard with vertebrates is still the subject of debate, and has even been suggested by some authors to be a separate phylum from cephalochordates and vertebrates. It was also the case for agnathans species &# 8211;myxines and hagfish&# 8211; for which phylogenetic evidence was recently given for a controversial monophyly. This raises the following question: which one of the cephalochordata or <b>urochordata</b> is the sister group of vertebrates and what are their relationships? In the present work, we analyzed 82 protein families presenting homologs between <b>urochordata</b> and other deuterostomes and focused on two points: 1) testing accurately the position of <b>urochordata</b> and cephalochordata phyla in regard with vertebrates as well as chordates monophyly, 2) performing an estimation of the rate of gene loss in the Ciona intestinalis genome.

Careful analysis of a new 18 S rDNA data set indicates that deuterostomes are composed of two major clades: chordates and echinoderms + hemichordates. This analysis strongly supports the monophyly {{of each of the}} four major deuterostome taxa: Vertebrata + Cephalochordata, <b>Urochordata,</b> Hemichordata, and Echinodermata. Hemichordates include two distinct classes, the enteropneust worms and the colonial pterobranchs.

We present a molecular phylogenetic analysis of hemichordates that challenges this long-held view. We used 18 S rRNA to infer evolutionary relationships of the hemichordate classes Pterobranchia and Enteropneusta. Our data show that pterobranchs may be derived within enteropneust worms rather than being a sister clade to the enteropneusts. The nesting of the pterobranchs within the enteropneusts dramatically alters our view of the evolution of the chordate body plan and suggests that the ancestral deuterostome more closely resembled a mobile worm-like enteropneust than a sessile colonial pterobranch...|$|E

In the basally diverging chordate subphylum <b>Urochordata,</b> animals in the class Ascidiacea do not employ T during gastrulation in endodermal or nonaxial mesodermal cells, {{and it has been}} suggested that nonnotochordal roles for T were acquired in the cephalochordate–vertebrate lineage after it split with <b>Urochordata.</b> To test this hypothesis, we cloned T from Oikopleura dioica, a member of the urochordate class Appendicularia (or Larvacea), which diverged basally in the subphylum. Investigation of the expression pattern in developing Oikopleura embryos showed early expression in presumptive notochord precursor cells, in the notochord, and in parts of the developing gut and cells of the endodermal strand.

The invertebrate deuterostomes (phyla Echinodermata and Hemichordata and subphyla <b>Urochordata</b> and Cephalochordata) lie in the transition zone between invertebrates and vertebrates, and are thus {{of interest to the}} study of evolution. Here we have investigated the carboxylesterase/cholinesterase gene family in the sequenced genomes of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Echinodermata), Saccoglossus kowalevskii (Hemichordata), Ciona intestinalis (<b>Urochordata)</b> and Branchiostoma floridae (Cephalochordata), using sequence analysis of the catalytic apparatus and oligomerisation domains, and phylogenetic analysis. All four genomes show blurring of structural boundaries between cholinesterases and carboxylesterases, with many intermediate enzymes. Non-enzymatic proteins are well represented. The Saccoglossus and Branchiostoma genomes show evidence of extensive gene duplication and retention. There is also evidence of domain shuffling, resulting in multidomain proteins consisting either of multiple carboxylesterase domains, or of carboxylesterase/ cholinesterase domains linked to other domains, including RING finger, chitin-binding, immunoglobulin, fibronectin type 3, CUB, cysteine-rich-Frizzled, caspase activation and 7 tm- 1, amongst others. Such gene duplication and domain shuffling in the carboxylesterase/cholinesterase family appears to be unique to the invertebrate deuterostomes, and we hypothesise that these factors {{may have contributed to the}} evolution of the morphological complexity, particularly of the nervous system and neural crest, of the vertebrates. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In general, the adenylation has been proposed {{to play a role}} in processing and termination of transcripts (Dubin et al. 1981; Montoya et al. 1983). No data on mt transcription are available in <b>Urochordata,</b> which is the basal Chordata subphylum; moreover, the mtDNA has been completely sequenced only for the Ascidiacea Halocynthia roretzi (Yokobori et al. 1999). Such mtDNA is quite compact and contains 12 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNAs, and 23 tRNAs. Compared with the gene content of Chordata, this genome contains an additional tRNA-Gly gene, related to the use of a peculiar genetic code (Durrheim et al. 1993; Yokobori et al. 1993).

The three Oikopleura otx genes are expressed similarly to vertebrate Otx paralogs, demonstrating that trans-homologs converged on similar evolutionary outcomes by independent neo- or subfunctionalization processes during {{the evolution of the}} two taxa. This work revealed that the Oikopleura CNS possesses homologs of the vertebrate forebrain, hindbrain, and spinal cord, but not the midbrain. Comparing larvacean gene expression patterns to published results in ascidians disclosed important developmental differences and similarities that suggest mechanisms of development likely present in their last common ancestor. In contrast to ascidians, the lack of a radical reorganization of the CNS as larvaceans become adults allows us to relate embryonic gene expression patterns to three subdivisions of the adult anterior brain. Our study of the Oikopleura brain provides new insights into chordate CNS evolution: first, the absence of midbrain is a urochordate synapomorphy and not a peculiarity of ascidians, perhaps resulting from their drastic CNS metamorphosis; second, there is no convincing evidence for a homolog of a midbrain–hindbrain boundary (MHB) organizer in urochordates; and third, the expression pattern of “MHB-genes” in the urochordate hindbrain suggests that they function in the development of specific neurons rather than in an MHB organizer...|$|E

In addition, experimental studies have demonstrated a close relationship between the inductive events andAs-Texpression. In the present study, we show that overexpression ofAs-Tby microinjection of the synthesizedAs-TRNA results in the occurrence, without the induction, of notochord-specific features in the A-line presumptive notochord blastomeres. We also show that overexpression ofAs-TRNA leads to ectopic expression of notochord-specific features in non-notochord lineages, including those of spinal cord and endoderm.
