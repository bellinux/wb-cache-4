5|$|Flower {{development}} {{begins when}} the flat meristem changes from producing leaves to an uplifted, conical meristem {{capable of producing}} stem elongation and a cluster of flowers. The cluster is a compound <b>umbel,</b> and each <b>umbel</b> contains several smaller umbels (umbellets). The first (primary) <b>umbel</b> occurs {{at the end of}} the main floral stem; smaller secondary umbels grow from the main branch, and these further branch into third, fourth, and even later-flowering umbels. A large, primary <b>umbel</b> can contain up to 50 umbellets, each of which may have as many as 50 flowers; subsequent umbels have fewer flowers. Individual flowers are small and white, sometimes with a light green or yellow tint. They consist of five petals, five stamens, and an entire calyx. The stamens usually split and fall off before the stigma becomes receptive to receive pollen. The stamens of the brown, male, sterile flowers degenerate and shrivel before the flower fully opens. In the other type of male sterile flower, the stamens are replaced by petals, and these petals do not fall off. A nectar-containing disc is present on the upper surface of the carpels.|$|E
5|$|Flowers change sex {{in their}} development, so the stamens release their pollen before {{the stigma of}} the same flower is receptive. The {{arrangement}} is centripetal, meaning the oldest flowers are near the edge and the youngest flowers are in the center. Flowers usually first open at {{the outer edge of}} the primary <b>umbel,</b> followed about a week later on the secondary umbels, and then in subsequent weeks in higher-order umbels. The usual flowering period of individual umbels is 7 to 10 days, so a plant can be in the process of flowering for 30–50 days. The distinctive umbels and floral nectaries attract pollinating insects. After fertilization and as seeds develop, the outer umbellets of an <b>umbel</b> bend inward causing the <b>umbel</b> shape to change from slightly convex or fairly flat to concave, and when cupped it resembles a bird's nest.|$|E
5|$|In Eurasia, some {{authorities}} {{distinguish between}} cultivated and wild versions of parsnips by using subspecies P. s. sylvestris for the latter, or even elevating it to species status as Pastinaca sylvestris. In Europe, various subspecies {{have been named}} based on characteristics such as the hairiness of the leaves, {{the extent to which}} the stems are angled or rounded, and the size and shape of the terminal <b>umbel.</b>|$|E
50|$|Compound <b>umbels</b> are <b>umbels</b> {{in which}} the single flowers are {{replaced}} by many smaller <b>umbels</b> called umbellets. The stem attaching the side umbellets to the main stem is called a ray.|$|R
5000|$|Plants in {{the genus}} Silaum have <b>umbels</b> which are {{characteristic}} of plants in the Apiaceae family (they are umbelliferous, [...] "umbel-bearing"); the <b>umbels</b> in Silaus species tend to lack bracts. Silaus species also {{tend to have a}} few umbellules (secondary <b>umbels</b> of compound <b>umbels),</b> and these umbellules have several small bracts called bractlets. Remains of dead leaves can often be found {{at the base of the}} plant; plants in Silaum are richly branched.|$|R
50|$|In {{early to}} midsummer, small globes of intense purple <b>umbels</b> appear, {{followed}} by attractive fruiting <b>umbels.</b> A popular cultivar, 'Globemaster', is shorter (80 cm) but produces much bigger, deep violet, <b>umbels</b> (15 - 20 cm). Both varieties {{have been granted}} the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|R
5|$|The {{tree onion}} or Egyptian onion {{produces}} bulblets in the <b>umbel</b> instead of flowers, {{and is now}} {{known to be a}} hybrid of A. cepa × A. fistulosum. It has previously been treated as a variety of A. cepa, for example A. cepa var. proliferum, A. cepa var. bulbiferum, and A. cepa var. viviparum. It has been grown for centuries in Japan and China for use as a salad onion.|$|E
5|$|In the autumn, {{the leaves}} die {{back and the}} outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle, so the crop is then {{normally}} harvested. If left in the soil over winter, the growing point {{in the middle of}} the bulb begins to develop in the spring. New leaves appear and a long, stout, hollow stem expands, topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence. The inflorescence takes the form of a globular <b>umbel</b> of white flowers with parts in sixes. The seeds are glossy black and triangular in cross section.|$|E
5|$|The {{inflorescence}} is scapose, {{the single}} stem or scape bearing either a solitary flower or forming an <b>umbel</b> {{with up to}} 20 blooms. Species bearing a solitary flower include section Bulbocodium and most of section Pseudonarcissus. Umbellate species have a fleshy racemose inflorescence (unbranched, with short floral stalks) with 2 to 15 or 20 flowers, such as N. papyraceus (see illustration, left) and N. tazetta (see Table I). The flower arrangement on the inflorescence may be either with (pedicellate) or without (sessile) floral stalks.|$|E
40|$|Onion, Allium cepa L. (Asparagales: Amaryllidaceae), crop fields {{grown for}} seed {{production}} require arthropod pollination for adequate seed yield. Although many arthropod species visit A. cepa flowers, for most {{there is little}} information on their role as pollinators. Small flower visiting arthropods (body width < 3 mm) in particular are rarely assessed. A survey of eight flowering commercial A. cepa seed fields in the North and South Islands of New Zealand using window traps revealed that small arthropods were highly abundant among all except one field. Insects belonging to the orders Diptera and Thysanoptera were the most abundant and Hymenoptera, Collembola, Psocoptera, Hemiptera, and Coleoptera were also present. To test whether small arthropods might contribute to pollination, seed sets from <b>umbels</b> caged within 3 mm diameter mesh cages were compared with similarly caged, hand-pollinated <b>umbels</b> and uncaged <b>umbels.</b> Caged <b>umbels</b> that were not hand-pollinated set significantly fewer seeds (average eight seeds/umbel, n = 10) than caged hand-pollinated <b>umbels</b> (average 146 seeds/umbel) and uncaged <b>umbels</b> (average 481 seeds/umbel). Moreover, sticky traps placed on <b>umbels</b> within cages captured similar numbers of small arthropods as sticky traps placed on uncaged <b>umbels,</b> suggesting cages did not inhibit the movement of small arthropods to <b>umbels.</b> Therefore, despite the high abundance of small arthropods within fields, evidence to support their role as significant pollinators of commercial A. cepa seed crops was not found...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT In carrot seed production, {{harvesting}} of the <b>umbels</b> {{is generally}} staggered, or sometimes the whole plant is harvested with the <b>umbels</b> {{at different stages}} of maturation; in that case, there is a risk of harvesting immature seeds and of losses due to natural dehiscent, or to physiological deterioration as a result of unfavourable environmental factors. The present study aimed to evaluate the physiological and biochemical changes related to the maturation of 'Planalto' carrot seeds from diferent <b>umbels.</b> The samples were collected 120 days after anthesis, with the primary, secondary and tertiary <b>umbels</b> being harvested separately. Seeds were analysed for germination, first count and germination rate, at temperatures of 25 ºC (optimum) to 35 ºC (adverse), as well as for emergence in the greenhouse and the emergence rate. Analyses were also carried out of the enzymes peroxidase (POX), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and of the total protein. Seeds obtained from the primary and secondary <b>umbels</b> displayed a higher rate of germination than from the tertiary <b>umbels,</b> with the seeds from the primary <b>umbels</b> showing high activity for peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase, and low activity for the enzyme ascorbate peroxidase...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] or {{flattened}} flowering scapes {{are normally}} persistent. The inflorescences are <b>umbels,</b> {{in which the}} outside flowers bloom first and flowering progresses to the inside. Some species produce bulbils within the <b>umbels,</b> and in some species, such as Allium paradoxum, the bulbils replace some or all the flowers. The <b>umbels</b> are subtended by noticeable spathe bracts, which are commonly fused and normally have around three veins.|$|R
5|$|The parsnip (Pastinaca sativa) is a root {{vegetable}} {{closely related to}} the carrot and parsley. It is a biennial plant usually grown as an annual. Its long, tuberous root has cream-colored skin and flesh; and left in the ground to mature, it becomes sweeter in flavor after winter frosts. In its first growing season, the plant has a rosette of pinnate, mid-green leaves. If unharvested, it produces its flowering stem, topped by an <b>umbel</b> of small yellow flowers, in its second growing season. By this time, the stem is woody and the tuber is inedible. The seeds are pale brown, flat, and winged.|$|E
5|$|The {{plants are}} scapose, having a single central {{leafless}} hollow flower stem (scape). Several green or blue-green, narrow, strap-shaped leaves {{arise from the}} bulb. The plant stem usually bears a solitary flower, but occasionally a cluster of flowers (<b>umbel).</b> The flowers, which are usually conspicuous and white or yellow, sometimes both or rarely green, consist of a perianth of three parts. Closest to the stem (proximal) is a floral tube above the ovary, then an outer ring composed of six tepals (undifferentiated sepals and petals), and a central disc to conical shaped corona. The flowers may hang down (pendent), or be erect. There are six pollen bearing stamens surrounding a central style. The ovary is inferior (below the floral parts) consisting of three chambers (trilocular). The fruit consists of a dry capsule that splits (dehisces) releasing numerous black seeds.|$|E
