This idea was further developed by , who suggested rifting might have been initiated by a change in plate direction, or by kinematic effects as the Kula-Farallon ridge migrated along the continental margin. One such effect is the formation of a slab window (or slab gap) which would allow increased <b>upwelling</b> of magma.|$|E

40|$|Seismology, {{thermodynamics}} {{and classical}} physics—the physics {{associated with the}} names of Fourier, Debye, Born, Grüneisen, Kelvin, Rayleigh, Rutherford, Ramberg and Birch—show that ambient shallow mantle under large long-lived plates is hundreds of degrees hotter than in the passive <b>upwellings</b> that fuel the global spreading ridge system, that potential temperatures in mantle below about 200 km generally decrease with depth and that deep mantle low shear wave-speed features are broad, sluggish and dome-like rather than narrow and mantle-plume-like. The surface boundary layer of the mantle is more voluminous and potentially hotter than regions usually considered as sources for intraplate volcanoes. This means that the ‘mantle plume’ explanation for Hawaii and large igneous provinces is unnecessary. In isolated systems, heated from within and cooled from above, <b>upwellings</b> are passive and large, which suggests that tomographic features, and <b>upwellings,</b> are responses to plate tectonics, spreading and subduction, at least until melting introduces a small intrinsic buoyancy at shallow depths. Melting anomalies, or ‘hotspots,’ are side-effects of plate tectonics and are fed primarily by shear-driven processes in the boundary layer (BL), not by deep buoyant <b>upwellings.</b> A dense basal melange (BAM) component further stabilises the lower boundary layer of the mantle. Mid-ocean ridges and associated broad passive depleted mantle (DM) <b>upwellings</b> probably originate in the transition region. Deeper mantle <b>upwellings</b> are broad domes that stay in the lower mantle...|$|R

5|$|More {{recent studies}} by volcanologists {{associated}} with the Geological Survey of Canada have indicated that the subducted extension of the Nookta Fault may be {{the primary cause of}} the alkalic structure of the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field. The volcanism might have been mostly generated by asthenospheric <b>upwelling</b> possibly by displacement along the transform fault. If the transform fault had a section of vertical tearing to contain potentially different dip angles between the Explorer and Juan de Fuca Plates, the subducted plate asthenosphere may possibly flow upward into the mantle wedge. Similarly, if the displacement had a section of extension, a horizontal slab window-like gap would have developed, again allowing a pathway for <b>upwelling</b> magma. In either case, the unsettled asthenosphere might have experienced low degrees of decompressional melting and interacted with North American lithosphere to yield within plate compositions.|$|E

WSN has capability to communicate temperature data in real time thus offering the opportunity for rapid response times to measure the biological impact of <b>upwellings</b> on reef assemblages. This permits us to collect the plankton data in real-time synchronized to the temperature changes. This paper outlines the methods of the deployment of WSN for ecological research.

Volcanoes near plate boundaries and mid-ocean ridges are built by the decompression melting of mantle rock that rises on an <b>upwelling</b> portion of a convection cell to the crustal surface. Eruptions associated with subducting zones, meanwhile, are driven by subducting plates that add volatiles to the rising plate, lowering its melting point.

5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} usually require {{very warm}} water to depth, generally above 26.5°C (80°F) extending {{to a depth}} of 50meters (160ft). However, the waters off California are cold even in summer. They rarely rise above 24°C (75°F) in near-shore southern California, and usually remain below 17°C (63°F) along {{most of the rest of}} the coast and outer coastal waters, although El Niño events may warm the waters somewhat. This is due primarily to the extensive <b>upwelling</b> of colder sub-surface waters caused by the prevailing northwesterly winds acting through the Ekman Effect. The winds drive surface water to the right of the wind flow, that is offshore, which draws water up from below to replace it. The <b>upwelling</b> further cools the already cool California Current which runs north to south along coastal California and even much of coastal Baja California. This is the same mechanism which produces coastal California's characteristic fog.|$|E

40|$|If mantle thermal <b>upwellings</b> (plumes) are {{the cause}} of {{volcanic}} “hot spots,” then observations suggest that plumes are relatively fixed with nonuniform distribution and limited lifetimes. To date, fixity of <b>upwellings</b> has only been shown in models of convection at either low-vigor or with layering, though studies where the lower mantle has high viscosity do frequently show <b>upwellings</b> with much lower drift velocities than the surface velocity. Since more vigorous convection traditionally shows more time dependence, fixity of <b>upwellings</b> has not been expected for nonlayered convection at Earth-like vigor; rather, we might expect slow but increasing drift velocities. I have undertaken numerical models of whole mantle convection in three-dimensional spherical geometry at approaching Earth-like vigor. Surprisingly, these simulations show prominent steady, virtually fixed, plumes arising from self-organization controlled by the smaller but numerous cold downwellings. If downwelling (subduction) dominates Earth's interior dynamics, then this work suggests that plume fixity need not require layering. The regular spacing and permanence of model <b>upwellings</b> contrast with observations of hot spots though. In these models, which do not simulate plates, the fixity and regular spacing result from the freedom of downwellings to occur everywhere except where plumes reach the surface. I suggest that on Earth this feedback is weakened {{by the presence of}} plates but that whole mantle thermal convection can still produce relatively fixed plumes, though we might expect them to be weaker, more mobile, and transient...|$|R

40|$|One way or another, {{the mantle}} convects. There is still {{discussion}} {{about whether the}} mode is whole mantle or layered {{and if it is}} driven primarily from the top. Radioactivity, secular cooling and strong plates influence convection and cause <b>upwellings</b> to be broad and migratory. Pressure and compositional effects cause the deep mantle to have very broad features. In any case, broad <b>upwellings</b> exist in the mantle, if only to replace the sinking slabs or to get rid of internal radioactive heat. These <b>upwellings</b> would exist even if the mantle were not heated from below and even if there were no lower thermal boundary layer (TBL). In the fluid dynamic literature buoyant <b>upwellings</b> are called plumes. It was suggested that plate tectonics and normal mantle convection could not explain hotspots, melting anomalies and volcanic chains because normal mantle was too cold. A different small-scale mode of convection was proposed (Morgan, 1971). The defining characteristics of mantle plumes have changed with time but great depth, a TBL origin, high temperatures, rapid ascent rates, and low viscosity are the invariants. Initially, mantle plumes were treated as fixed, whole-mantle, chemically primitive or enriched and responsible for lifting and breaking continents and for driving plate tectonics.

At {{this point in the}} dynamo cycle, buoyant <b>upwelling</b> within the convective zone forces emergence of toroidal magnetic field through the photosphere, giving rise to pairs of sunspots, roughly aligned east–west and having footprints with opposite magnetic polarities. The magnetic polarity of sunspot pairs alternates every solar cycle, a phenomenon known as the Hale cycle.|$|E

The NHC had anticipated the movement {{to be part of}} a small loop in the Gulf of Honduras, although the agency noted continued uncertainty. Steadily deteriorating, Mitch weakened below major hurricane intensity late on October28, due to land interaction, <b>upwelling,</b> and possibly an eyewall replacement cycle. On October29, the hurricane made landfall in Honduras, east of La Ceiba, with winds of 80mph (130km/h). Despite being over land, the NHC continued to predict a turn to the north, which would allow for restrengthening.|$|E
