25|$|Stillman Witt {{also had}} {{financial}} {{interests in the}} iron and steel industry. The iron and steel manufacturing firm of Chisholm, Jones and Company had organized in 1857. It was reorganized in 1860 as Stone, Chisholm & Jones after receiving major investments from Stillman Witt, Henry Chisholm, Amasa Stone, Andros Stone, Henry B. Payne, and Jeptha Wade. Witt made a second investment in the firm in November 1863, reorganizing the steel mill into the Cleveland Rolling Mill (later known as the American Steel & Wire Co.). Witt was named {{a director of the}} new company. Witt was elected a director of the Mercer Iron & Coal Company in 1865, director of the Pittsburgh and Lake Angeline Iron Company in 1870, and president of the <b>Union</b> Steel <b>Screw</b> Company (a new firm organized by himself, Henry Chisholm, William Chisholm, Henry Payne, Amasa Stone, and Andros Stone) in 1872.|$|R
5000|$|Stonewall was a Southern {{pilot boat}} {{captured}} by <b>Union</b> <b>screw</b> gunboat [...] on, or sometime shortly before, 24 February 1863.

50|$|Shortly after midnight, lookouts {{on screw}} steamer Stettin — herself an {{erstwhile}} blockade runner now, following capture, turned blockader — spotted Aries off Bull's Bay, South Carolina, attempting to {{slip through the}} blockade with a cargo of liquor. The <b>Union</b> <b>screw</b> gunboat immediately weighed anchor and gave chase. When the runner was within range, Stettin opened fire on Aries and continued the pursuit until shoal water forced her to anchor.|$|E
50|$|Early in the Civil War—a small, {{privately owned}} {{schooner}} -- {{worked out of}} Mobile, Alabama, under Confederate papers as a blockade runner. Few details of these operations have been found; {{but we do know}} that, on the night of 11 October 1862, she succeeded in slipping through the Federal blockade off Mobile Bay and sailed to Cuba laden with cotton. After arriving at Havana, Cuba, six days later, she delivered her cargo and filled up with lead, tin, medicine, wine, coffee, and other items needed by the South. On the evening of 14 November, as she was attempting to return to Mobile, Ariel was detected and captured by the <b>Union</b> <b>screw</b> steamer Huntsville. Sent to Key West, Florida, for adjudication, the schooner was eventually condemned as a lawful prize and was purchased by the Union Navy from the Key West prize court on 24 July 1863.|$|E
40|$|Arthrodeses of 81 ankles {{performed}} by a single surgeon were reviewed after a 12 - to 74 -month follow up. Aver-age time to union was 13. 8 weeks, and 71 (88 %) of 81 ankles healed without a second surgery. Ten (12 %) of the 81 ankles failed to unite. Of the 10 nonunions, two de-veloped a dense fibrous <b>union</b> without <b>screw</b> failure, and eight underwent revisional surgery. Seven of the revi-sions united and one has a persistent nonunion. The transfibular approach was utilized, and specific factors related to this approach were assessed. A greater resec-tion of the medial malleolus correlated to a longer heal-ing time and to an increased rate of nonunion. Sixty (96 %) of the 63 patients who returned for follow up had no signs or symptoms attributable to malalignment. The average postoperative score for ankle-hindfoot on the AOFAS evaluation was 74 points, and rate of the patient satisfaction was 65 (89 %) of the 73 patients. There was no correlation between outcomes and patients ages. Greater tarsal mobility correlated with a higher postop-erative score and to higher level of satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: We {{assessed}} the radiographic and clinical results of one surgeon’s experience treating proximal humerus fractures with a locked proximal humeral plate. Materials and Methods: Twenty patients with unstable proximal humerus fractures {{were treated with}} a locking compression plate between February 2005 and September 2007. The {{average age of the}} patients was 60. 6 years, and the average postoperative follow-up period was 22. 3 months. The clinical results were evaluated using the Constant and DASH scores. The radiologic results were evaluated by the Paavolainen method, which measures the neck shaft angle and humeral head height. Results: At the last follow-up examination, the mean Constant score was 75. 3 and 15 cases (75 %) had excellent or good results; the mean DASH score was 16. 4. The mean neck shaft angle was 137. 1 。, and 19 cases (95 %) had good results by the Paavolainen method. There was one delayed <b>union,</b> malunion, and <b>screw</b> loosening. Conclusion: The patients treated with a locking compression plate had relatively good clinical and radio-logic results, and a low complication rate. Moreover, the patients could exercise earlier due to good reduction and initial stability. Treatment of unstable proximal humerus fractures with a locking compres...|$|R
40|$|Background: Nondisplaced {{scaphoid}} fractures {{treated with}} prolonged cast immobilization {{may result in}} tempo-rary joint stiffness and muscle weakness {{in addition to a}} delay in return to sports or work. Fixation of scaphoid fractures with a percutaneous cannulated screw has resulted in a shorter time to union and to return to work or sports. The purpose of this prospective, randomized study was to compare cast immobilization with percutaneous cannulated screw fixation of nondisplaced scaphoid fractures with respect to time to radiographic union and to return to work. Methods: Twenty-five full-time military personnel with an acute nondisplaced fracture of the scaphoid waist con-sented to be randomized to either cast immobilization or fixation with a percutaneous cannulated Acutrak screw (Acumed, Beaverton, Oregon) {{for the purpose of this}} study. Time to fracture union, wrist motion, grip strength, and return to work as well as overall patient satisfaction at the time of a two-year follow-up were evaluated. Results: Eleven patients were randomized to percutaneous cannulated screw fixation, and fourteen were random-ized to cast immobilization. The average time to fracture <b>union</b> in the <b>screw</b> fixation group was seven weeks com-pared with twelve weeks in the cast immobilization group (p = 0. 0003). The average time until the patients returned to work was eight weeks compared with fifteen weeks in the cast immobilization group (p = 0. 0001). There was no significant difference in the range of motion of the wrist or in grip strength at the two-year follow-u...|$|R
5000|$|On {{the evening}} of 10 January, orders reached Lt. Devens to send his boats to assist [...] which had run aground that morning while {{attempting}} to refloat the stranded blockade runner Bendigo near Lockwood's Folly Inlet. About midnight, her boats — along with some from , , and Governor Buckingham — received the officers and men of the doomed <b>Union</b> <b>screw</b> steamer. The following morning, 11 January, Aries joined Minnesota, Daylight, and Governor Buckingham in chasing the blockade runner Ranger which was attempting to enter the Cape Fear River with a cargo from Newcastle upon Tyne, England. The Northern ships drove the steamer aground where she was abandoned by her crew. However, their efforts to refloat Ranger as a prize were stopped by Southern sharpshooters [...] "...whose fire completely commanded her (Ranger's) decks." [...] Since {{it was impossible to}} take possession of Ranger, the Union sailors burned her.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the morning}} of the 27th, however, as Bermuda {{approached}} Great Abaco Island, the <b>Union</b> <b>screw</b> steamer Mercedita, cruising off the Providence Channel as part of the East Division, Gulf Blockading Squadron, fell in with her and gave chase. At a point somewhere between three and seven miles northeast of the Hole-in-the-Wall Light, a shot across her bow brought Bermuda to. The ensuing boarding party not only found discrepancies in the cargo manifests, but about a thousand tons of contraband cargo, including: [...] Since the ship’s log yielded the information that she had “run the blockade before” and her captain admitted that her cargo was “intended finally to reach the rebel States,” Comdr. Henry S. Stellwagen, Mercedita’s commanding officer, seized Bermuda and sent her to Philadelphia under Lt. Trevett Abbot and a 30-man prize crew. Part of the cargo that was seized was a substantial shipment of blank paper sheets that were intended for the printing of Confederate currency. Made from seaweed pulp in England, the paper was watermarked CSA. Transferred to Philadelphia, the paper eventually became the property of the Currency Bureau (precursor to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing). The Currency bureau used the paper for the printing of specimen notes of fractional currency and so specimen notes exist with the CSA watermark, including the notes on the Fractional currency shield. Sheets of the blank paper are known to exist. This seizure was by far the most important of the entire cargo.|$|E
5000|$|Repairs completed, the tug {{departed}} Washington, D.C., late in July, {{bound for}} Hampton Roads and duty with the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. After patrol and reconnaissance assignments, Young America proceeded to the Baltimore Navy Yard on 13 October 1861 for further repairs {{and returned to}} duty in Hampton Roads late in November. On 26 February 1862, the vessel briefly left the Virginia Capes area for Currituck Inlet, North Carolina, to rescue crewmen and stores threatened with capture when <b>Union</b> <b>screw</b> steamer [...] grounded on 25 February. Young America performed invaluable service to the squadron during engagements with CSS Virginia (the former Federal screw frigate Merrimack) on 8 and 9 March 1862. On 8 March, Young America towed [...] to an anchorage off Sewell's Point, Virginia, enabling the frigate to bombard Confederate batteries ashore. On 9 March, she refloated the grounded Union frigate, , and jockeyed the vessel into firing position against Virginia. Later, Young America rescued the crew of Union gunboat [...] when fire destroyed that vessel on 10 March 1862. She also rescued personnel on board Henry Adams, grounded at Nag's Head, North Carolina, on 26 August 1862. Young America left for repairs at the Baltimore Navy Yard in September. Young America returned to Hampton Roads in mid-October 1862, resuming duties as an armed guard tug. On 30 November 1862, [...] and Young America towed monitor [...] to the Washington Navy Yard for repairs but returned to Newport News, Virginia, early in December and, but for occasional runs north, operated {{in the vicinity of}} Hampton Roads and the James River {{through the end of the}} Civil War. On 7 January 1864, the tug was finally purchased by the Navy from the Boston prize court.|$|E
40|$|PosterMost of {{forestry}} or agroforestry artificial plantations either have an orthogonal design, or curvilinear under contour lines to prevent soil erosion. These designs {{are known to}} maximize machinery workflow or erosion control respectively. As in many occasions in land use management, what optimizes machinery operation is not what optimizes prevention of soil loss and vice versa. An alternative and intermediate design system such as an Archimedes spiral could offer in one hand, the ability to have equidistant lines to facilitate machinery operation and, in other hand reduce soil loss in comparison to orthogonal designs. Additionally can be an alternative design when aesthetics {{plays a role in}} the planting decision. Although the spiral land use design is present in permaculture related literature, scaling up the methodology to forestry is practically absent in literature. This work tries to contribute to the knowledge of planting trees in an Archimedes spiral design. Making a spiral is a trivial command in computer assisted design, but this work envisaged the creation of the spiral in the field without any high technology software (e. g. tractor with laser technology) to enlarge the scope of possible application. We used the spiral equation to explore and define in the spiral: 1) the number of turns, 2) the distance between the arms and 3) the tree density. The widest machinery of the farmer was five meters so, to allow the tractor to move inwards and outwards in the spiral, we opted to design twelve meters between rows to allow 1 meter safety distance to the tree line. The final spiral would have three arms with two meters between trees in the line (240 trees). Part of the challenge was to implement the spiral with the exact dimensions in order to respect the farmer needs. To implement the spiral in the field a “field spiralographer” was made with the following description: an axis with about 1 meter high, where on top was placed a base with six equidistant arms. Each arm was made telescopic to allow different lengths of the arms. At 2 meters from the center the arms were marked and a screw pin was placed on the mark. A rope was rolled up around the screw pins. The number of complete turns is equal to the number of lines existing in the field spiral. Because the <b>union</b> of the <b>screw</b> pins in the arms’ builds a hexagon with 6 x 2 meters perimeter, a full turn has 12 meters length. To mark the spiral in the field, start unrolling the rope and walk at the same time avoiding a loose rope, marking the place for planting the trees. By the end of a full turn around the “spiralographer” there should be 12 meters distance between the first and last tree mark. By keeping unrolling the rope until needed, the spiral keeps being designed in the field depending on the turns needed. In other words, the “spiralographer” could be an hexagon with R radius, being 6 xR, the distance between the lines in the spiral. Unrolling and keeping the rope unloose will provide a guide to mark the spiral in the field. Because the description might be unclear, a video was made showing the “making of” this spiral preparation: [URL] The experimental site is being used to survey operational costs to compare with conventional designs...|$|R
