25|$|An MP {{can ask for}} {{leave to}} move the {{adjournment}} of Parliament {{for the purpose of}} discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance. If the MP obtains the general assent of Parliament or at least eight MPs rise in their places to support the motion, the motion stands adjourned until 5:30pm on the same day. At that time, any proceedings on which Parliament is engaged are suspended so that the <b>urgent</b> <b>matter</b> may be raised. Proceedings on the motion for adjournment may continue until the moment of interruption, whereupon if they have not been completed the motion lapses. The postponed proceedings are resumed either on the disposal or the lapse of the motion for adjournment. Not more than one such motion for adjournment may be made at any one sitting.|$|E
25|$|With the {{situation}} looking increasingly dangerous for his army, Napoleon reassessed the developments and probably {{noted that he}} was holding the central position of an increasingly curved battlefront. He first sent word to Davout to hasten his attack preparations against the Austrian left, but the most <b>urgent</b> <b>matter</b> was to stabilise his own battered left wing. The Emperor {{did not want to}} commit his valuable, fresh infantry reserves just yet, so he ordered Masséna to break contact with the enemy and take his IV Corps southwards and attack the Austrian VI Korps. Executing such a manoeuvre required great skill and incurred high risks, as it meant that Masséna's men would have to move in vulnerable march column formations, through a sector with numerous enemy infantry, cavalry and artillery. The departure of these troops also meant that an enormous gap would open up in the French line, which the Emperor ingeniously intended to fill by forming an enormous grand battery, which would check enemy advance in this sector through a sustained artillery barrage. This required time and, with the Austrians from III Korps menacingly moving forward, Napoleon counted on Maréchal Bessières's cavalry to allow Masséna to disengage and the grand battery to deploy.|$|E
500|$|Meeker {{had long}} {{contemplated}} {{the idea of}} marking the Oregon Trail, over which he had traveled in 1852, with granite monuments. By the early 20th century, {{he was convinced that}} the Trail was in danger of being forgotten. Farmers were plowing up the Trail bit by bit, and as towns and cities grew along it, the Trail vanished under streets and buildings. [...] Meeker viewed its preservation as an <b>urgent</b> <b>matter</b> because of this slow disappearance. [...] He wanted the Trail properly marked, and monuments erected to honor the dead.|$|E

500|$|On 26 July, Gotovina {{deployed}} the 2nd Battalion of the 9th Guards Brigade to the Bosansko Grahovo axis. The battalion outflanked the VRS force {{blocking the}} HV 114th Infantry Brigade composite company and attacked the VRS defences from their rear. Even though the HV could not advance more than , {{the move was}} sufficient to allow the HV 7th Guards Brigade to press on with their attack and push the VRS back by [...] that day, reaching within [...] from Bosansko Grahovo. The imminent threat to the town sitting astride the most significant route between the Republika Srpska and the RSK capital of Knin, became an <b>urgent</b> <b>matter</b> to the RSK. The 2nd Guards Brigade of the RSK Special Units Corps was ordered to disengage from the ARBiH 5th Corps in Bihać pocket area and move to Bosansko Grahovo to defend the town. A battalion of RSK police was also ordered to bolster the defence in the area. While the police battalion declined to deploy claiming that the General Staff had no authority over the police, the RSK 2nd Guards Brigade did not reach Bosansko Grahovo in time {{to contribute to the}} defence.|$|E
500|$|Wilkinson felt a deep bond {{of sympathy}} {{with the people of}} Jarrow and the loss of the {{shipyard}} which was the life-source of the town. [...] Early in 1934 she led a deputation of Jarrow's unemployed to meet the prime minister, MacDonald, in his nearby Seaham constituency. She records {{that at the end of}} the meeting MacDonald said to her: [...] "Ellen, why don't you go out and preach socialism, which is the only remedy for all this?" [...] This [...] "priceless remark", she says, brought home the [...] "reality and sham... of that warm but so easy sympathy". She became Jarrow's MP [...] in the general election of November 1935, when she won the seat with a majority of 2,360. In the opening debate of the new parliamentary session, on 9 December 1935, she pleaded on behalf of her new constituents: [...] "These are skilled fitters, men who have built destroyers and battleships and the finest passenger ships... The years go on and nothing is done... this is a desperately <b>urgent</b> <b>matter</b> and [...] something should be done to get work to these areas which, Heaven knows, want work." ...|$|E
500|$|In a daylong trip, {{the party}} reached the next station located [...] north {{by the second}} watch of the night. Heavy rains and wind made further advance impossible, but despite rain on the next day, Zhai Yong urged Choe and the Koreans to push on regardless, {{explaining}} that the regulations for prompt arrival times in China's courier system were very stringent. The party covered another [...] on March 11, completely soaked by the rain {{when they reached the}} next station. The station master provided the party with a small fire to keep warm, but a man who thought the Koreans were captured pirates barged in and kicked their fire out in a rage. Zhai Yong dutifully wrote an account of this assault and passed it on to the county magistrate's office before having the party continue en route to their destination on the following day, March 12. They reached the Beidu River on that day, boarding ships that would lead them to the Grand Canal, the central courier and trade artery of China that would carry them all the way to Beijing. At this point, water transport was the preferable means of travel for the courier agents; Choe wrote [...] "all envoys, tribute, and commerce come and go by water. If either the water in the locks and rivers is too shallow because of drought to let boats pass or there is a very <b>urgent</b> <b>matter,</b> the overland route is taken." [...] When the party reached Ningbo on that day, Choe Bu remarked on the beautiful scenery; when they reached Cixi City, he noted the city's many markets and cluttering of warships; upon entering Ningbo and reaching the Supreme Piracy-Defense Office, Choe wrote that the gates and crowds there were three times as great as at Cixi.|$|E

2500|$|In Korea, the Prime Minister, Kim Hong-jip ( [...] , [...] ) persuaded Seo to {{join the}} cabinet as the Oemu hyeoppan (외무협판, the modern {{equivalent}} to Minister of Foreign Affairs). However, Seo rejected the proposal, urging grassroots enlightenment {{to be a more}} <b>urgent</b> <b>matter</b> than his entry into the national cabinet. Seo viewed the absence of support from the populous as the primary cause of the Gapsin Coup failure. He also judged that the success of the Gabo reform (1894) was reliant solely on the support from the public. In order to achieve this support, it was most imperative to have a progressive newspaper as a vehicle of mass education.|$|E
2500|$|Bond {{receives}} a message, apparently {{from his son}} James Suzuki (Suzuki's mother is Kissy Suzuki from You Only Live Twice, now dead from ovarian cancer) asking {{him to come to}} New York City on an <b>urgent</b> <b>matter.</b> When Bond arrives, he finds his son murdered. With the aid of an SIS agent, he learns that James was killed in revenge by Irma Bunt for the murder of Ernst Stavro Blofeld, [...] and a woman whom Bond assumed had died alongside Blofeld (again in You Only Live Twice). James Suzuki's death was by way of being force fed fugu syrup, akin to a murder in You Only Live Twice. Bond's victory over Bunt is hollow, due to him having {{to come to grips with}} his absentee fathering and not spending time with his only remaining blood relative.|$|E

2500|$|Urbšys {{returned}} to Lithuania {{to consult the}} government. German officials confirmed that the secret protocols were real and informed Lithuanians that transfer of the territory in Suvalkija was not an <b>urgent</b> <b>matter.</b> Eventually, Nazi Germany sold rights this territory to the Soviet Union [...] for 7.5 million dollars on January 10, 1941 in the German–Soviet Border and Commercial Agreement. Lithuanians in principle agreed to sign the mutual assistance treaty, but were instructed to resist Soviet bases as much as possible. Alternatives included doubling Lithuanian army, exchanging military missions, and building fortifications on the western border with Germany similar to the Maginot Line in France. On October 7, Lithuanian delegation, including General Stasys Raštikis and Deputy Prime Minister Kazys Bizauskas, {{returned to}} Moscow. Stalin refused the proposed alternatives, but agreed {{to reduce the number}} of Soviet troops to 20,000 – about the size of the entire Lithuanian army. Soviets wanted to sign the treaty right then to commemorate the 19th anniversary of the Żeligowski's Mutiny and Lithuania's loss of Vilnius. Political rallies, organized in Vilnius demanding city's incorporation into the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, put additional pressure on Lithuanians and provided a sense of urgency. Urbšys refused to sign and the talks receded for the second time.|$|E
