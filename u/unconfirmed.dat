5|$|Meitnerium has no stable or {{naturally}} occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing {{the decay of}} heavier elements. Eight different isotopes of meitnerium have been reported with atomic masses 266, 268, 270, and 274–278, two of which, meitnerium-268 and meitnerium-270, have known but <b>unconfirmed</b> metastable states. A ninth isotope with atomic mass 282 is <b>unconfirmed.</b> Most of these decay predominantly through alpha decay, although some undergo spontaneous fission.|$|E
5|$|Roentgenium has no stable or {{naturally}} occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusion of the nuclei of lighter elements or as intermediate decay products of heavier elements. Eight different isotopes of roentgenium {{have been reported}} with atomic masses 272, 274, 278–282, and 286 (<b>unconfirmed),</b> two of which, roentgenium-272 and roentgenium-274, have known but <b>unconfirmed</b> metastable states. All of these decay through alpha decay or spontaneous fission.|$|E
5|$|Augustus died in AD 14 {{at the age}} of 75. He {{probably}} {{died from}} natural causes, although there were <b>unconfirmed</b> rumors that his wife Livia poisoned him. He was succeeded as Emperor by his adopted son (also stepson and former son-in-law) Tiberius.|$|E
5|$|Dukovac was the top-scoring Croatian {{pilot of}} World War II. During his life, {{there was much}} {{controversy}} surrounding {{the exact number of}} aircraft that he had downed. Croatian wartime documents discovered in the Military History Institute in Belgrade after his death show that the ZNDH credited him with 44 confirmed kills. At least one other source indicates a tally of 40 confirmed kills with five <b>unconfirmed.</b> The ZNDH total of 44 included 18 LaGG-3s, 12 Ilyushin Il-2s, three P-39s, two DB-3s, two Yak-1s, and one each of the following aircraft; II-16, MiG-3, Spitfire, La-5, Yak-9, Pe-2, and A-20. The ZNDH records also noted one <b>unconfirmed</b> claim.|$|E
5|$|The proton-rich {{isotopes}} with masses 260, 261, and 262 {{were directly}} produced by cold fusion, those with mass 262 and 264 {{were reported in}} the decay chains of meitnerium and roentgenium, while the neutron-rich isotopes with masses 265, 266, 267 were created in irradiations of actinide targets. The five most neutron-rich ones with masses 270, 271, 272, 274, and 278 (<b>unconfirmed)</b> appear in the decay chains of 282Nh, 287Mc, 288Mc, 294Ts, and 290Fl respectively. These eleven isotopes have half-lives ranging from about tenmilliseconds for 262mBh to about oneminute for 270Bh and 274Bh, extending to about twelve minutes for the <b>unconfirmed</b> 278Bh, one of the longest-lived known superheavy nuclides.|$|E
5|$|This {{species has}} been {{reported}} from all continents except Antarctica, usually under names such as Volvariella gloiocephala or Volvariella speciosa.

5|$|All of the wharves {{along the}} coast of Mississippi were {{reportedly}} ruined. In Mobile, Alabama, the storm uprooted trees and damaged several buildings, including a church. Tides rose several feet above normal, flooding low-lying streets such that fishermen were able to deliver their catches directly to market by boat. Some businesses sustained minor water damage, but overall, the city was spared any significant destruction, and received little impact on shipping. To the east, there were <b>unconfirmed</b> reports of significant damage to wharves and warehouses along the Florida Panhandle, but these accounts may have been exaggerated by rival companies.|$|E
5|$|Amin did {{not write}} an autobiography, {{and he did not}} authorize an {{official}} written account of his life. So, there are discrepancies regarding when and where he was born. Most biographical sources claim that he was born in either Koboko or Kampala around 1925. Other <b>unconfirmed</b> sources state Amin's year of birth from as early as 1923 to as late as 1928. Amin's son Hussein has stated that his father was born in Kampala in 1928.|$|E
5|$|At one time, one {{hurricane}} researcher {{identified a}} tropical storm over Cuba in late August, {{although there was no}} evidence the storm actually existed. There was also a report of a hurricane over Louisiana on October22, although it is unknown if it was related to other storms in the season. There may have been additional <b>unconfirmed</b> tropical cyclones during the season. Meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimates up to six storms were missed from the official database, due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, and relatively unpopulated coastlines.|$|E
5|$|Balabushka {{cues from}} the Gus Szamboti era are typified by {{straight}} grained maple forearms bearing four ebony points, with four veneers included, normally colored black, green, white and mahogany, or sometimes with an orange veneer {{in place of}} mahogany. Balabushka cues from this era, spanning {{the last five years}} of his life, are considered the finest of his career as a class. There have been <b>unconfirmed</b> rumors that some few cues made during this period included splices made by Balabushka himself.|$|E
5|$|Bohrium has no stable or {{naturally}} occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing {{the decay of}} heavier elements. Twelve different isotopes of bohrium have been reported with atomic masses 260–262, 264–267, 270–272, 274, and 278, one of which, bohrium-262, has a known metastable state. All of these but the <b>unconfirmed</b> 278Bh decay only through alpha decay, although some unknown bohrium isotopes are predicted to undergo spontaneous fission.|$|E
5|$|By some accounts, Smith {{had been}} {{teaching}} a polygamy doctrine {{as early as}} 1831, and there is <b>unconfirmed</b> evidence that Smith was a polygamist by 1835. Although the church had publicly repudiated polygamy, in 1837 there was a rift between Smith and Oliver Cowdery over the issue. Cowdery suspected Smith had engaged {{in a relationship with}} his serving girl, Fanny Alger. Smith never denied a relationship, but insisted it was not adulterous, presumably because he had taken Alger as a plural wife.|$|E
5|$|D. s. harrissoni, {{known as}} the Bornean Rhinoceros or Eastern Sumatran rhinoceros, which was once common {{throughout}} Borneo; now, only about 15 individuals are estimated to survive. The known population lives in East Kalimantan, with them having recently gone extinct in Sabah. Reports of animals surviving in Sarawak are <b>unconfirmed.</b> This subspecies is named after Tom Harrisson, who worked extensively with Bornean zoology and anthropology in the 1960s. The Bornean subspecies is markedly smaller than the other two. The captive population consists of one male and two females at the Borneo Rhinoceros Sanctuary in Sabah.|$|E
5|$|Darmstadtium has no stable or {{naturally}} occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing {{the decay of}} heavier elements. Nine different isotopes of darmstadtium have been reported with atomic masses 267, 269–271, 273, 277, and 279–281, although darmstadtium-267 and darmstadtium-280 are <b>unconfirmed.</b> Two darmstadtium isotopes, darmstadtium-270 and darmstadtium-271, have known metastable states. Most of these decay predominantly through alpha decay, but some undergo spontaneous fission.|$|E
5|$|Following his 23rd {{victory on}} 1 April, Voss fired upon pilot and plane {{on the ground}} after the crash. On 6 April 1917, he staked two victory claims 15 minutes apart, having brought down a {{two-seater}} and a Sopwith Pup near one another {{on either side of}} the front lines. The two-seater pilot braved both Voss's strafing and incoming German artillery to retrieve aerial photography plates for their military intelligence value. The Sopwith Pup, though later seen with Jasta 2 in German markings after its capture, was an <b>unconfirmed</b> victory despite landing behind German lines.|$|E
5|$|In {{the tunnel}} after the match tempers boiled over between staff of both clubs. A slice of pizza {{had been thrown}} at Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson by Cesc Fàbregas, which was {{initially}} <b>unconfirmed</b> until 13 years after the incident. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger was furious in his post-match briefing, criticising Riley for his performance and describing Van Nistelrooy as a cheat. His comments were investigated by the Football Association, who later fined him £15,000 for improper conduct. Van Nistelrooy was retroactively banned for three matches as his challenge on Cole was missed by Riley.|$|E
5|$|Issues of Gallicanism were {{prominent}} in the 1689 conclave that had elected Alexander VIII. Alexander's predecessor, Innocent XI, had refused to confirm new French bishops {{to the point where}} thirty-five dioceses lacked a bishop confirmed by Rome in 1688. Alexander's election had been secured by promising that he would confirm the <b>unconfirmed</b> French bishops. Despite this, Alexander's last act as pope before he died was to condemn the Declaration of the Clergy of France on 1 February 1691.|$|E
5|$|It is {{reported}} that the worst damage occurred in Escambia and Monroe counties. In the Escambia County city of Atmore, 100 percent of the city's residents lost electric power for some {{a period of time}} during the hurricane. The strongest winds occurred in Escambia County, where gusts surpassed , leaving numerous structures damaged or destroyed as Dennis tracked through the western half of the county. One man in the county was injured by a fallen tree branch. Also, an <b>unconfirmed</b> tornado tore the roof off a home, forcing emergency workers to evacuate a man inside.|$|E
5|$|Its growing rarity {{increased}} interest from European museums and private collectors in obtaining skins and eggs of the bird. On 3 June 1844, {{the last two}} confirmed specimens were killed on Eldey, {{off the coast of}} Iceland, ending the last known breeding attempt. Later reports of roaming individuals being seen or caught are <b>unconfirmed.</b> A record of one great auk in 1852 is considered by some to be the last sighting of a member of the species. The great auk is mentioned in several novels and the scientific journal of the American Ornithologists' Union is named The Auk in honour of this bird.|$|E
5|$|Meitnerium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Mt and atomic number 109. It {{is an extremely}} radioactive synthetic element (an element not found in nature that can be created in a laboratory).

5|$|On 10 May 1940, German forces {{launched}} an offensive in Western Europe, but Wick {{remained on the}} ground while his aircraft, Bf 109 Yellow 2, underwent an engine change. Seven days later, {{he was back in}} the air, recording three victories over French LeO 45 bombers in one mission. By 6 June, Wick had 10 confirmed and two <b>unconfirmed</b> victories, including four French Bloch 151/152 fighters that he shot down on 5 June to record his fifth through eighth victories. The two <b>unconfirmed</b> victories were Royal Navy Fairey Swordfish biplane torpedo bombers claimed on 19 May and for which he had no witnesses. On 6 June, Wick became the first pilot of the I. Gruppe to complete 100 combat missions, claiming his ninth and tenth victory the same day. For this achievement he was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class by Oberstleutnant Harry von Bülow-Bothkamp. By the end of the French Campaign, Wick's total stood at 14 confirmed victories, trailing only Hauptmann (Captain) Mölders of JG53 with 25 victories and Hauptmann Wilhelm Balthasar of JG27 with 23 victories as the Luftwaffes top scorer. At the end of the French campaign, 3. Staffel headquarters moved into the house of Louis Aston Knight, an artist who had fled {{a few days before the}} Germans arrived.|$|E
5|$|Only one {{historical}} eruption {{is known}} from Burney, which occurred in 1910. This eruption has a {{volcanic explosivity index}} of 2, and was observed by a merchant ship. This eruption appeared to coincide with an earthquake and tsunami on 24 June 1910 in the area. An <b>unconfirmed</b> report of an eruption in 1920 exists, as well as reports of {{a flash of light}} and earthquakes during the night of 24 June 1970. No reports of such activity were identified in the contemporaneous newspaper , however.|$|E
5|$|Pakistan {{came under}} intense {{international}} scrutiny after the raid. The Pakistani government denied {{that it had}} sheltered bin Laden, and said it had shared information with the CIA and other intelligence agencies about the compound since 2009. The United States had direct evidence that the ISI chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, knew of bin Laden’s presence in Abbottabad, Pakistan. After the raid, there was an <b>unconfirmed</b> report that Pakistan allowed Chinese military officials to examine {{the wreckage of the}} crashed helicopter.|$|E
5|$|Poland, {{home of the}} world's largest Jewish {{community}} {{before the}} war, lost 3,300,000 (90percent) of its Jewish population. Although the Germans rigorously imposed {{the death penalty for}} hiding Jews, some Poles hid Jews (saving their lives) despite the risk to themselves and their families. Although reports of the Holocaust had reached Western leaders, public awareness in the United States and other democracies of the mass murder of Jews in Poland was low at the time; the first references in The New York Times, in 1942, were <b>unconfirmed</b> reports rather than front-page news.|$|E
5|$|Roentgenium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Rg and atomic number 111. It is {{a synthetic}} element {{that can be}} created in a laboratory but is not found in nature.
