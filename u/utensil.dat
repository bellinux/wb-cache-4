5|$|Mansaf is a {{traditional}} meal in the central West Bank and Naqab region in the southern West Bank, having its roots from the Bedouin population of ancient Arabia. It is mostly cooked on occasions such as, during holidays, weddings or a large gathering. Mansaf is cooked as a lamb leg or large pieces of lamb {{on top of a}} taboon bread that has usually been smothered with yellow rice. A type of thick and dried cheesecloth yogurt from goat's milk, called jameed, is poured on top of the lamb and rice to give it its distinct flavor and taste. The dish is also garnished with cooked pine nuts and almonds. The classic form of eating mansaf is using the right hand as a <b>utensil.</b> For politeness, participants in the feast tear pieces of meat to hand to the person next to them.|$|E

50|$|Slavery, colonization, {{trading and}} the {{introduction}} of western education were all factors that contributed to the gradual under-utilisation and elimination of the traditional <b>utensils.</b> Historically the pursuit for western education in colonial schools, plantation workers who went to the coast to work in rubber or banana estates, kola nut traders who went to Northern Nigeria from the Grass-fields came back home with modern <b>utensils.</b> Those who were not fortunate to travel and stayed in the hinterlands and villages used traditional <b>utensils,</b> and were considered poor or primitive by those who acquired the Whiteman’s <b>utensils.</b>|$|R

25|$|Yet they cannot boil it all, for – first, fuel is very scarce; {{that which}} is {{supplied}} weekly would not cook a meal a day…and they have to search the already bare kopjes for a supply. There is hardly a bit to be had. Second, they have no extra <b>utensil</b> to hold the water when boiled. I propose, therefore, to give each tent a pail or crock, and get a proclamation issued that all drinking water must be boiled.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{knocking}} down {{a wall in}} order to make space for an extension or repair of the wall would be demolition for a constructive purpose. Combing a wig to set it correctly and pulling out hairs during the procedure with a metal toothed brush or comb would be constructive 'demolition', as each hair that's removed in the process of the wig (a <b>utensil)</b> is progressing its state towards a completion which is desired. Each hair's removal is a partial demolition of the wig (for these legal purposes) and is considered constructive when viewed in context of the desired goal.|$|E
25|$|In {{a famous}} fragment, Empedocles {{attempted}} {{to explain the}} phenomena of respiration {{by means of an}} elaborate analogy with the clepsydra, an ancient device for conveying liquids from one vessel to another. This fragment has sometimes been connected to a passage in Aristotle's Physics where Aristotle refers to people who twisted wineskins and captured air in clepsydras to demonstrate that void does not exist. There is however, no evidence that Empedocles performed any experiment with clepsydras. The fragment certainly implies that Empedocles knew about the corporeality of air, but he says nothing whatever about the void. The clepsydra was a common <b>utensil</b> and everyone who used it must have known, in some sense, that the invisible air could resist liquid.|$|E

25|$|Samuel ben Meir, {{brother of}} Jacob ben Meir, argued that infused tastes could endure in a cooking vessel or <b>utensil</b> {{for up to}} 24 hours; his {{suggestion}} led to the principle, known as ben yomo (Hebrew: son of the day, בן יומו), that vessels and utensils {{should not be used}} to cook milk within 24 hours of being used to cook meat (and vice versa). Although, after 24 hours, some residual flavour may still reside in porous cooking vessels and utensils, some rabbis hold the opinion that such residue would become stale and fetid, hence only infusing taste for the worse (Hebrew: nosen taam lifgam, נותן טעם לפגם), which they do not regard as violating the ban against mixing the tastes of milk and meat.|$|E
25|$|According to Jewish law, a sefer Torah (plural: Sifrei Torah) is {{a copy of}} {{the formal}} Hebrew text {{handwritten}} on gevil or klaf (forms of parchment) by using a quill (or other permitted writing <b>utensil)</b> dipped in ink. Written entirely in Hebrew, a sefer Torah contains 304,805 letters, all of which must be duplicated precisely by a trained sofer ("scribe"), an effort that may take as long as approximately one and a half years. Most modern Sifrei Torah are written with forty-two lines of text per column (Yemenite Jews use fifty), and very strict rules about the position and appearance of the Hebrew letters are observed. See for example the Mishnah Berurah on the subject. Any of several Hebrew scripts may be used, most of which are fairly ornate and exacting.|$|E
25|$|The McFlurry is a soft-serve {{ice cream}} dessert that has pieces of candy or cookies mixed into it. The McFlurry was first {{integrated}} into the menu at a Bathurst, New Brunswick, Canada franchisee in 1995 and in the United States in 1998. The flavors are crushed Oreo, M's Minis, Reese's, or Mars, Incorporated candy bars like Snickers, Twix, Galaxy, etc., Cadbury's candy bars like Twirl, Wispa, Creme Egg, Crunchie etc., Nestlé candy bars like Yorkie, Smarties, Drifter, Rolo, Butterfinger, etc. McDonald's also does limited time only flavors, e.g. for Shrek the Third it released the Ogre-Load flavor. In Australia, they had a special range for their 40 years in Australia celebration. The flavors were double choc fudge, bubblegum squash, strawberry crumble and caramel cookie. Also in Malaysia, a unique flavor called FuseofmyLife is offered to customers. The mixing blade for the dessert is actually a specially designed spoon with a hollow handle that attaches to the mixer spindle (except in Australia and New Zealand where the staff mix it by hand). The blade is used once then given to the customer to use as an eating <b>utensil.</b> Originally test marketed in Hawaii in 1997, it is now available in most of its markets.|$|E

50|$|Benjamin Thompson noted at {{the start}} of the 18th century that kitchen <b>utensils</b> were {{commonly}} made of copper, with various efforts made to prevent the copper from reacting with food (particularly its acidic contents) at the temperatures used for cooking, including tinning, enamelling, and varnishing. He observed that iron had been used as a substitute, and that some <b>utensils</b> were made of earthenware. By the turn of the 20th century, Maria Parloa noted that kitchen <b>utensils</b> were made of (tinned or enamelled) iron and steel, copper, nickel, silver, tin, clay, earthenware, and aluminium. The latter, aluminium, became a popular material for kitchen <b>utensils</b> in the 20th century.|$|R
