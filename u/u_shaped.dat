While in 2004 the Central Electoral Commission allowed <b>U</b> <b>shaped</b> line in which people would first cast a ballot for President and then cast a separate ballot for each of the two questions, the Commission ordered voters to cast all votes at once on separate ballots. Voters who choose not to cast a referendum ballot simply declined to pick up the extra two ballots.|$|E

25|$|The 20th century {{ranch house}} style {{has its roots}} in North American Spanish colonial {{architecture}} of the 17th to 19th century. These buildings used single story floor plans and native materials in a simple style {{to meet the needs of}} their inhabitants. Walls were often built of adobe brick and covered with plaster, or more simply used board and batten wood siding. Roofs were low and simple, and usually had wide eaves to help shade the windows from the Southwestern heat. Buildings often had interior courtyards which were surrounded by a <b>U</b> <b>shaped</b> floor plan. Large front porches were also common. These low slung, thick-walled, rustic working ranches were common in the Southwestern states.|$|E

These groups travelled to Thamnḡakar and prepared, practised and dressed up just outside the settlement.

The later recording are taken after the ritual arrival of the dancers at the dancing ground. Dancer stands in line forming a <b>U</b> <b>shape.</b> The dancers split along several lines: woman and children stand in the middle and men on outside.

40|$|Keywords：rectification; condenser; tower; Bernoulli {{equation}} Abstract：Bernoulli {{equation is}} used in this paper to deduce the calculation formula for the height of liquid seal in the <b>U</b> <b>shape</b> tube. Practice shows the result is reasonable and right. The conclusions provide foundation for engineering design. In the rectification device, {{in order to improve}} product’s purity on the top of distillation tower, we need to put part of the condensed liquid through condenser into the distillation tower. But at this point, if the height of liquid seal in the <b>U</b> <b>shape</b> tube is insufficient, it cannot ensure the smooth. operation of distillation. Therefore, this paper using the Bernoulli equation to deduce the calculation formula for the height of liquid seal in the <b>U</b> <b>shape</b> tube.
