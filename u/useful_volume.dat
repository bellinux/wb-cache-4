Although most of the cars were sold in France, <b>useful</b> <b>volumes</b> were also achieved in the more mountainous regions of Switzerland where, until the arrival in Europe of the Subaru, there was significant customer demand for reasonably priced four wheel drive cars which the larger auto-makers were disinclined to address.|$|R
50|$|Global {{attention}} to the Bosnian war has brought {{a number of other}} <b>useful</b> <b>volumes</b> into print in English. Perhaps the most important among such titles is Scar On the Stone, edited by Chris Agee, which includes an excellent and representative selection of recent Bosnian poetry, much of it directly influenced by the 1992-95 war. I would recommend the book, which includes excerpts and commentaries by Mak and by Francis R. Jones, without qualification, and will only indicate two writers I believe deserve special attention, in that they represent two sides of Sarajevo literary life.|$|R
50|$|The {{power plant}} {{will consist of}} a set of 12 to 20 radial-axial {{hydraulic}} turbine units with a capacity of 1,000 MW each, operating at maximum head of 184 m. The dam will create Evenk (Turukhansky) reservoir, with an area of 9,400 sq km, complete and <b>useful</b> <b>volume</b> of 409.4 and 101.0 cu km respectively, and a length of about 1200 km. Planned for below the Evenk Hydropower Plant is a second plant (Evenk II), of 790 MW, the main task of which will be to equalize the uneven discharge of water from the main hydroelectric power station.|$|E
50|$|In some cases, {{a course}} {{projected}} by localizer {{is at an}} angle to the runway (usually due to obstructions near the airport). It is then referred to as a localizer type directional aid (LDA). The localizer system is placed about 1,000 feet from {{the far end of the}} approached runway. Usable volume extends to 18 NM for a path up to 10° either side of runway centerline. At an angle of 35° either side of runway centerline, the <b>useful</b> <b>volume</b> extends up to 10 NM. Horizontal accuracy increases as distance between the aircraft and localizer decreases. Localizer approach specific weather minimums are found on approach plates.|$|E
50|$|Higher peak powers {{could only}} be {{achieved}} by increasing the density of excited CO2 molecules. The capacity for stored energy per unit volume of gas increases linearly with density and thus gas pressure, but the voltage needed to achieve gas breakdown and couple energy into the upper laser levels increases at the same rate. The practical solution avoiding very high voltages was to pulse the voltage transversely to the optical axis (rather than longitudinally {{as was the case}} for low pressure lasers), limiting the breakdown distance to a few centimetres. This allowed the use of manageable voltages of a few tens of kV. The problem was how to initiate and stabilize a glow discharge at these much higher gas pressures, without the discharge degenerating into a bright high-current arc, and how to achieve this over a <b>useful</b> <b>volume</b> of gas.|$|E
50|$|The {{big news}} for 1937 was an all new steel body. This {{put an end}} to {{concerns}} that had arisen since 1932 when the timber frame bodies had gained a reputation for distorting or even snapping as the manufacturer introduced modified bodies with successively lengthened wheel-bases. The new body, which DKW celebrated with a return to the DKW Sonderklasse name, was in fact shared with the Wanderer W24 from DKW’s fellow member of the Auto Union. In this form the Sonderklasse continued to be produced in <b>useful</b> <b>volumes</b> and without further significant changes until 1940.|$|R

50|$|The left-to-right {{shunting}} {{of blood}} results in abnormally high blood flow and pressure {{directed to the}} right heart circulation, gradually leading to maladaptive changes that ultimately result in pulmonary hypertension. Increased right-sided blood volume and pressure causes a cascade of pathologic damage to the delicate pulmonary capillaries, causing them to be incrementally replaced with scar tissue. Scar (dead lung tissue) does not contribute to oxygen transfer, therefore decreasing the <b>useful</b> <b>volume</b> of the pulmonary vasculature. The scar tissue also provides less flexibility and compliance than normal lung tissue, causing further increases in pulmonary blood pressure, and the weakened heart must pump harder to continue supplying the lungs, leading to damage of more capillaries. It is because of this maladaptive response that {{at the onset of}} Eisenmenger's syndrome, the damage is considered irreversible, even if the underlying heart defect is corrected after the fact.|$|E

50|$|Standard CubeSats {{are made}} up of 10×10×11.35 cm units {{designed}} to provide 10×10×10 cm or 1 liter of <b>useful</b> <b>volume</b> while weighing no more than 1.33 kg per unit. The smallest standard size is 1U, while 3U+ is the largest being composed of three units stacked lengthwise with an additional 6.4 cm diameter cylinder centered on the long axis and extending 3.6 cm beyond one face. The Aerospace Corporation has constructed and launched two smaller form CubeSats of 0.5U for radiation measurement and technological demonstration. In recent years larger CubeSat platforms have been proposed, most commonly 6U (10×20×30 cm or 12×24×36 cm) and 12U (20x20x30 cm or 24x24x36 cm), to extend the capabilities of CubeSats beyond academic and technology validation applications and into more complex science and national defense goals. In 2014 two 6U Perseus-M CubeSats were launched for maritime surveillance, those two CubeSats represent the largest CubeSats flown as of 2015. The 2018 launch of the InSight lander to Mars, will include two 6U CubeSats called Mars Cube One (MarCO).|$|E
30|$|These {{forms the}} basis of a {{simultaneous}} inversion procedure that estimates acoustic and shear impedances (Zp and Zs) from prestack seismic gathers. The basic assumptions made from the approximation (Eq.  4) are that the earth has approximately horizontal layers at each common depth point and that each layer is described by both acoustic and shear impedances. Once acoustic impedance Zp and shear impedance Zs volumes have been created, they can be easily used to create other <b>useful</b> <b>volumes,</b> such as Poisson impedance, PI and lambda-rho, λρ and mu-rho, µρ, which are the product of density and the Lamé elastic constants λ and µ (Goodway et al. 1997).|$|R

50|$|The banking {{crisis of}} 1893, however, {{affected}} his position so much, {{that he was}} obliged to do {{a great deal of}} journalism for the Argus and Australasian. Sutherland did a large amount of literary work. He was responsible for the first volume only of Victoria and its Metropolis, published in 1888, an interesting history of the first 50 years of the state of Victoria. In 1890 he published Thirty Short Poems, the cultured verse of an experienced literary man, but his most important book was The Origin and Growth of the Moral Instinct, which appeared in 1898 in two volumes. Sutherland had long brooded over this book and was greatly pleased at receiving the commendation of some of the leaders of philosophic thought in England. Generally the book was well received both in Europe and the United States. With his brother, George Sutherland, he wrote a short History of Australia, which attained a sale of 120,000 copies, and he collaborated with Henry Gyles Turner in a <b>useful</b> <b>volume,</b> The Development of Australian Literature (1898). His undoubted powers as a teacher gave value to his text book, A New Geography, and other works of that kind. He contributed on scientific subjects to the Nineteenth Century, and did a large amount of lecturing on literature and science in Melbourne.|$|E
5000|$|This is {{a wide-ranging}} {{survey of the}} {{interaction}} of the doctrine of creation and physical science from the patristic writers of the early church to Einstein and Bohr. It is a <b>useful</b> <b>volume</b> in a series of introductory textbooks in the history of theology. His approach {{is similar to that of}} the history-of-ideas school. Kaiser argues that the basic theme in the [...] "creation tradition" [...] is [...] "that the entire universe is subject to a single code of law which was established along with the universe at the beginning of time." [...] This theme manifested itself in four flexible ideas: (1) the comprehensibility of the world; (2) the unity of earth and heaven; (3) the relative autonomy of nature; and (4) the ministry of health care and reconciliation. A majority of the book deals with theologians and natural philosophers from the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries. Kaiser discusses many of the topics important for this bibliography--from hermeticism to the Puritan thesis. For example, he has an interesting insight into the relation between Newton's Arianism and his views of space and time. Kaiser is good on the details of theological differences and theological rationale. In this, his work complements those historians of science who miss the nuances within theological debates. The usefulness of Kaiser's book is partially frustrated by a lack of footnotes, some correctable mistakes, and some overapplications of his thesis to particular figures. Overall, however, it is recommended as a replacement for Dillenberger's comparable survey.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{flow control}} in the downlink direction for a microcellular CDMA system carrying integrated packet level-data and voice services {{with the objective of}} providing maximum traffic capacity without service degradation due to overload. The goal of this research is to develop flow control techniques that regulates the admitted calls based on the prediction of the total transmitted power requirements over the next packet transmission interval. If the probability of exceeding the maximum power value is sufficiently low, the extra power required to accommodate the data transmission is unlikely to result in outage and, therefore, data flow is permitted. The autocovariance function of the transmitted power under maximally loaded traffic conditions allows such predictions. With packet-level flow control, one can potentially transmit <b>useful</b> <b>volumes</b> of packet data even when no fixed mean data transmission rate can be guaranteed. The traffic admitted to any cell is increased if the traffic in the neighboring cells happens to be low. Using constant bit rate (CBR) speech transmission with 100 % activity, the system can accommodate about 67 mobiles. With available bit rate (ABR), we can accommodate up to 82 data mobiles receiving data at the same average rate of 8 Kb/sec...|$|R

40|$|In {{an effort}} to produce {{clinically}} <b>useful</b> <b>volumes</b> of tissue engineered bone products, a direct perfusion bioreactor system was developed. Perfusion flow rate, flow direction, and {{the position of the}} bioreactor are factors that influenced the amounts and homogeneity of the cells seeded on the scaffold surface. Goat bone marrow stromal cells (GBMSCs) were dynamically seeded and proliferated in this system in relevant volumes (10 cm 3) of small-sized macroporous biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) scaffolds (2 - 6 mm). Cell load and cell distribution were shown using Methylene Blue block staining, and 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) staining was used to demonstrate the viability of the cells. Although cells were not distributed homogenously after cell seeding, the scaffolds were covered with a viable, homogeneous cell layer after 25 days of cultivation. The hybrid structures became interconnected, and a dense layer of extracellular matrix formed on and in the scaffolds. Online oxygen measurements during cultivation were correlated with proliferating GBMSCs. It was shown that the oxygen consumption could possibly be used to estimate GBMSC population doubling times during growth in this bioreactor system. On the basis of our results, we conclude that a direct perfusion bioreactor system is capable of seeding and proliferating GBMSCs on BCP ceramic scaffolds that can be monitored online during cultivation...|$|R
