5|$|The {{trivalent}} dysprosium ion (Dy3+) {{has been}} studied due its downshifting luminescence properties. Dy-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG:Dy) excited in the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>region</b> {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} results in the emission of photons of longer wavelength in the visible region. This idea is the basis {{for a new generation of}} UV-pumped white light emitting diodes.|$|E
5|$|These {{polarization}} detectors {{are sensitive}} in the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>region</b> {{of the light}} spectrum. In some army ant species, a group of foragers who become separated from the main column may sometimes turn back on themselves and form a circular ant mill. The workers may then run around continuously until they die of exhaustion.|$|E

The afterglow reached its peak luminosity in both bands approximately 2days after the burst was first detected—19.6±0.3 in the U-band at 02:13UTC on May11, and 19.8±0.2 in the R-band at 20:55UTC on May 10.|$|E

50|$|The {{absorption}} in the {{gas phase}} occurs in three regions of the spectrum. Rotational transitions are responsible for absorption in the microwave and far-infrared, vibrational transitions in the mid-infrared and near-infrared.

40|$|Abstract. The {{electrical}} and optical properties, and microstructures of 100 nm-thick Ga 2 O 3 films fabricated on Al 2 O 3 (0001) substrates by a sputtering deposition were investigated. The partial pressure of oxygen was controlled and the substrate temperature was kept to be 500 °C during deposition. With increasing the oxygen partial pressure, {{the structures of}} the Ga 2 O 3 films deposited on the substrates were observed to change from amorphous to crystalline (monoclinic β-type Ga 2 O 3). The transmittance of the Ga 2 O 3 films {{was measured to be}} more than 80 % at the visible and <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>regions</b> although the electrical resistivity was high. In order to obtain both low electrical resistivity and high transmittance at the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>regions,</b> the addition of active dopant elements such as Sn into the Ga 2 O 3 films would be required...|$|R
5|$|Although {{plants are}} {{better known for}} {{defensive}} mimicry, there are exceptions. For example, many flowers use mimicry to attract pollinators, while others may trick insects into dispersing their seeds. Nonetheless, most mimicry in plants would not be classified as aggressive, as although luring pollinators is similar to cases above, they are certainly not eaten by the plant. However some carnivorous plants {{may be able to}} increase their rate of capture through mimicry. For example, some have patterns in the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>region</b> of the electromagnetic spectrum, much like the spider webs described above.|$|E
5|$|As pH {{rises above}} 0 the above yellow hydrolyzed species form {{and as it}} rises above 2–3, reddish-brown hydrous iron(III) oxide {{precipitates}} out of solution. Although Fe3+ has an d5 configuration, its absorption spectrum is not like that of Mn2+ with its weak, spin-forbidden d–d bands, because Fe3+ has higher positive charge and is more polarizing, lowering the energy of its ligand-to-metal charge transfer absorptions. Thus, all the above complexes are rather strongly colored, with the single exception of the hexaquo ion – and even that has a spectrum dominated by charge transfer in the near <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>region.</b> On the other hand, the pale green iron(II) hexaquo ion 2+ does not undergo appreciable hydrolysis. Carbon dioxide is not evolved when carbonate anions are added, which instead results in white iron(II) carbonate being precipitated out. In excess carbon dioxide this forms the slightly soluble bicarbonate, which occurs commonly in groundwater, but it oxidises quickly in air to form iron(III) oxide that accounts for the brown deposits present in a sizeable number of streams.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{physical}} properties of astatine have been estimated (by interpolation or extrapolation), using theoretically or empirically derived methods. For example, halogens get darker with increasing atomic weight– fluorine is nearly colorless, chlorine is yellow-green, bromine is red-brown, and iodine is dark gray/violet. Astatine is sometimes described as probably being a black solid (assuming it follows this trend), or as having a metallic appearance (if it is a metalloid or a metal). The melting and boiling points of astatine are also expected to follow the trend seen in the halogen series, increasing with atomic number. On this basis they {{are estimated to be}} , respectively. Some experimental evidence suggests astatine may have lower melting and boiling points than those implied by the halogen trend. Astatine sublimes less readily than does iodine, having a lower vapor pressure. Even so, half of a given quantity of astatine will vaporize in approximately an hour if put on a clean glass surface at room temperature. The absorption spectrum of astatine in the middle <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>region</b> has lines at 224.401 and 216.225nm, suggestive of 6p to 7s transitions.|$|E
40|$|The fluid {{actinometry}} {{portion of}} the Microbial Response to Space Environment Experiment (M 191) was designed for measurement of the solar energy that penetrates certain optical filter systems during exposure in space. Potassium ferrioxalate {{was used to measure}} energy at peak wavelengths of 254, 280, and 300 nanometers because of its high degree of sensitivity and its linear response to the middle <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>regions...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Nd:YAG laser generates {{energy in}} the near {{infrared}} region of the electromagnetic spectrum, with a wavelength of 1064 nm.

5|$|Type I diamond has {{nitrogen}} (N) atoms as {{the main}} impurity, at a concentration of up to 1%. If the N atoms are in pairs or larger aggregates, they do not affect the diamond's color; these are Type Ia. About 98% of gem diamonds are type Ia: these diamonds belong to the Cape series, named after the diamond-rich region formerly known as Cape Province in South Africa, whose deposits are largely Type Ia. If the nitrogen atoms are dispersed throughout the crystal in isolated sites (not paired or grouped), they give the stone an intense yellow or occasionally brown tint (type Ib); the rare canary diamonds belong to this type, which represents only ~0.1% of known natural diamonds. Synthetic diamond containing nitrogen is usually of type Ib. Type Ia and Ib diamonds absorb in both the infrared and <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>region</b> of the electromagnetic spectrum, from 320nm. They also have a characteristic fluorescence and visible absorption spectrum (see Optical properties).|$|E
25|$|One {{prominent}} {{feature in}} measured extinction curves of many objects within the Milky Way {{is a broad}} 'bump' at about 2175 Å, well into the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>region</b> of the electromagnetic spectrum. This feature was first observed in the 1960s, but its origin is still not well understood. Several models have been presented to account for this bump which include graphitic grains {{with a mixture of}} PAH molecules. Investigations of interstellar grains embedded in interplanetary dust particles (IDP) observed this feature and identified the carrier with organic carbon and amorphous silicates present in the grains.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescence is the {{emission}} of light by {{a substance that}} has absorbed light or other electromagnetic radiation. It {{is a form of}} luminescence. In most cases, the emitted light has a longer wavelength, and therefore lower energy, than the absorbed radiation. The most striking example of fluorescence occurs when the absorbed radiation is in the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>region</b> of the spectrum, and thus invisible to the human eye, while the emitted light is in the visible region, which gives the fluorescent substance a distinct color that can only be seen when exposed to UV light. Fluorescent materials cease to glow immediately when the radiation source stops, unlike phosphorescence, where it continues to emit light for some time after.|$|E
40|$|Organic {{semiconductors}} having conjugate bonds, such as phthalocyanines, {{are well}} known photoconductors. Phthalocyanines absorb light {{on either side of}} blue-green region in the visible spectrum. And polyaniline which has conjugate bonds is photosensitive. When polyaniline thin films are prepared with copper phthalocyanine powder the magnitude of absorption of the films not only increases but also broadens, indicating a wide absorption region between 1. 7 and 2. 3 eV and above 3. 0 eV of the visible spectrum. Thus copper phthalocyanine is shown to increase the efficiency of solar cells made of conducting polymers such as polyaniline. The use of iodine along with copper phthalocyanine in preparation of thin films is shown to smooth the broadening effect in absorption of solar cells. Attempts are underway to increase the absorption on either end of the visible spectrum, viz., infrared as well as <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>regions,</b> using suitable dopants. This would ensure the overall efficiency of solar cells made of organic photoconductive materials to absorb solar energy from infrared to <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>regions</b> of the optical spectrum, thereby making them more efficient solar energy converters.

The apparatus combines a greater tuning range than that obtained using cw dye lasers with enhanced sensitivity over pulsed systems using analogue detection...|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{some other}} octodontids, common degus are diurnal (active during the day), {{and they have}} good vision. Their retinas include rod cells and two types of cone cells, {{corresponding}} to peak sensitivity in the green and <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>regions</b> of the spectrum. Behavioral experiments have shown that degus are able to discriminate ultraviolet light from the wavelengths visible to humans; {{it is likely that}} this ultraviolet sensitivity has a social function, since both their ventral (stomach) fur and their urine are highly UV reflective.|$|R
25|$|The plasma and {{energetic}} particles {{present in the}} magnetosphere of Saturn, when absorbed by ring particles and moons, cause radiolysis of the water ice. Its products include ozone, hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen. The first one has been detected in the surfaces of Rhea and Dione, while the second {{is thought to be}} responsible for the steep spectral slopes of moons' reflectivities in the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>region.</b> The oxygen produced by radiolysis forms tenuous atmospheres around rings and icy moons. The ring atmosphere was detected by Cassini {{for the first time in}} 2004. A fraction of the oxygen gets ionized, creating a small population of O2+ ions in the magnetosphere. The influence of Saturn's magnetosphere on its moons is more subtle than the influence of Jupiter on its moons. In the latter case, the magnetosphere contains a significant number of sulfur ions, which, when implanted in surfaces, produce characteristic spectral signatures. In the case of Saturn, the radiation levels are much lower and the plasma is composed mainly of water products, which, when implanted, are indistinguishable from the ice already present.|$|E
