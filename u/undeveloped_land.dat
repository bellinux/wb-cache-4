5|$|Since 1992, {{the city}} has {{undergone}} several boundary expansions. One expansion incorporated <b>undeveloped</b> <b>land</b> in the southeast for an industrial park and a Louisiana-Pacific Canada veneer factory. The city extended sewer and water lines to the location; however, the area was not developed and with the factory only half-built, L-P Canada abandoned its plans. A business making manufactured homes bought the factory and completed its development in 2005. Another expansion incorporated the existing oriented strand board factory in {{the northwest corner of}} the city, while further incorporations have included <b>undeveloped</b> <b>land</b> to the south and north.|$|E

40|$|This {{graduated}} thesis {{concerns the}} agricultural and <b>undeveloped</b> building <b>land</b> market in Slovenia between 2007 and 2009. The current legislation on real estate, in particular on land market and mass appraisal, is shortly presented. The real estate database, mass appraisal models for agricultural and <b>undeveloped</b> building <b>land,</b> which is managed by The Surveying and Mapping Authority of the Republic of Slovenia, are presented. The {{real estate market}} data are primary data {{for the analysis of}} the agricultural and <b>undeveloped</b> building <b>land</b> market activity. The main emphasis of the thesis is on the analysis of location impact on the market activity and price of the agricultural and <b>undeveloped</b> building <b>land.</b> Location is defined as the accessibility (travel time) to the centre at different levels (state – capital city Ljubljana, regional – centres of developed regions, local – centres of administrative units, municipalities and settlements). We confirmed the hypothesis, that location has an impact on the activity and price of the agricultural and <b>undeveloped</b> building <b>land</b> market. It has been shown, that accessibility to the capital city has the strongest impact on the agricultural and <b>undeveloped</b> building <b>land</b> market. In further analyses of mass appraisal models we found out that land values, calculated based on mass appraisal models for agricultural and <b>undeveloped</b> building <b>land,</b> do not consider location in the form of accessibility to the centres at different levels...|$|R

5|$|In the 1950s, the New York State Thruway (Interstate 90) {{was built}} through the Pine Bush, disrupting habitat and ecology. Further {{development}} {{took place in}} the 1950s and 60s with the construction of the W. Averell Harriman State Office Building Campus and the SUNY Albany uptown campus.

5|$|The Wilderness Act {{enhanced}} the protection status of remote or <b>undeveloped</b> <b>land</b> already contained within federally administered protected areas.

The ways people may enter wilderness areas are on foot or on horseback.|$|E

5|$|As {{the route}} heads east, it passes Pine View Cemetery and several local businesses. At an {{intersection}} with Glenwood Avenue (CR34), the county's internal designation for NY254 becomes CR70, whereafter the route passes over Halfway Brook {{and under the}} Gerald B. Solomon Bikeway Bridge– {{a part of the}} Warren County Bikeway. The highway progresses southeasterly upon intersecting NY9L as NY254 turns due southeast to avoid Floyd Bennett Memorial Airport. Along this stretch, NY254 heads through <b>undeveloped</b> <b>land</b> before entering another area of commercial development as it approaches the outskirts of Hudson Falls. Here, the route meets NY32 at Highland Avenue before intersecting Lower Warren Street (here unsigned NY911E) {{on the banks of the}} Hudson River.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the Upper Ottawa Street crossing, {{residential}} {{developments are}} confined to {{the north side of}} the Linc as it curves southward, descending towards the top of the Red Hill Valley. Surrounded by <b>undeveloped</b> <b>land,</b> it meets the northern end of Dartnall Road at a trumpet interchange, with Mt. Albion Conservation Area to the southeast and the Red Hill Creek passing beneath the interchange to traverse the Niagara Escarpment at Albion Falls. The Linc gradually curves back northeast, now surrounded, passing under Pritchard Road. Immediately east of there, the Mud Street interchange branches off as the route curves northward and becomes the Red Hill Valley Parkway, which descends the escarpment towards the QEW.|$|E
5|$|FM1957 {{begins at}} FM471 near Rio Medina, as a two-lane country road.

In far western Bexar County, Potranco Road travels through recently built, patchy, residential developments. Development becomes somewhat heavier after the highway passes State Highway211 (SH211), but FM1957 still displays mostly rural characteristics until the highway reaches Loop1604, at which point it enters the San Antonio city limits. Now five lanes wide, with two lanes in each direction and a center turn lane, the legislative definition of FM1957 becomes UR1957; however, Potranco Road remains signed as FM1957.|$|E
50|$|With the {{establishment}} of the municipalities system on April 1, 1889, the town of Kōriyama was established within Asaka District.

The relative abundance of hydroelectric power also helped with the development of local industry.|$|R

The area now known as Newport News was once a part of Warwick County. Warwick County was one of the eight original shires of Virginia, formed by the House of Burgesses in the British Colony of Virginia by order of King Charles I, in 1634.

5|$|Outside of Castorland, {{the road}} runs across a half-mile (0.8km) stretch of <b>undeveloped</b> <b>land</b> prior to {{crossing}} the Black River, {{which serves as}} {{the boundary between the}} towns of Denmark and Croghan. On the opposite riverbank, NY410 continues across another open stretch to reach the small hamlet of Naumburg. Here, the route passes a handful of homes and intersects the north end of CR33 (Van Amber Road) before ending at an intersection with NY126 on the northeastern fringe of the hamlet. While NY410 terminates at this junction, its right-of-way continues past NY126 as Cross Road, a local highway connecting Naumburg to CR8 (Second Road).|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} new town was planned, Crawley was a retail centre for the {{surrounding}} area: there were 177 shops in the town in 1948, 99 of which were on the High Street. Early new town residents relied on these shopping facilities until the Corporation implemented the master plan's designs for a new shopping area on the mostly <b>undeveloped</b> <b>land</b> east of the High Street and north of the railway line. The Broadwalk and its 23 shops were built in 1954, followed by the Queen's Square complex and surrounding streets in the mid-1950s. Queen's Square, a pedestrianised plaza surrounded by large shops and linked to the High Street by The Broadwalk, was officially opened in 1958 by Queen Elizabeth II. The town centre was completed by 1960, by which time Crawley was already recognised as an important regional, rather than merely local, shopping centre.|$|E

Here, NY31E and NY271 split, with NY31E following State Street eastward through the eastern portion of the community.

The quantified benefits comprise open space property value premiums received by properties located near undeveloped lands; benefits to participants in wildlife-associated recreation activities; benefits associated with the conservation of threatened, endangered or rare species; and ecosystem services provided by terrestrial habitats, wetlands and aquatic habitat improvements. We also use available data on National Wildlife Refuge visitation and state-level participation in wildlife-associated recreation activities to construct two sets of models that allow users to estimate the number of wildlife-associated activity days an existing or proposed conservation area generates per year, or the additional days tha...|$|R

5|$|Red Dead Redemption is {{a western}} action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective. Players control John Marston, and {{complete}} missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to {{progress through the}} story. Outside of missions, players may freely roam the open world.

These horses must be tamed {{in order to use}} them. Marston can utilize trains for quick travelling, but he can also stop the train by threatening or killing the passengers or driver. The game's <b>undeveloped</b> <b>land</b> makes up the largest portion of the game world, featuring various rugged and vast landscapes with occasional travelers, bandits, and wildlife. Urban settlements range from isolated farmhouses to crowded towns. Besides the American West, the player can also traverse a fictional Mexican state bordering the United States.|$|E
