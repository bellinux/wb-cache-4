5|$|The {{album was}} a {{critical}} and commercial success, particularly in Europe, unusually so for a hip hop album at that time. Bumrush the Show had been recorded {{on the heels of}} Run-D.M.C.'s Raising Hell, but was held back by Def Jam {{in order for them to}} concentrate on releasing and promoting the Beastie Boys' License to Ill. Chuck D of Public Enemy felt that by the time their first record was released, BDP and Rakim had already changed the landscape for how an MC could rap. Public Enemy were already recording their second album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold <b>Us</b> <b>Back</b> (Def Jam, 1988) when Bumrush hit stores.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Public Enemy {{released}} {{their second}} album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold <b>Us</b> <b>Back</b> to critical and commercial success. Their music's dense textures, {{provided by the}} group's production team The Bomb Squad, exemplified a new production aesthetic in hip hop at the time. The controversial, politically charged lyrics by the group's lead rapper Chuck D, whose braggadocio raps contained references to political figures such as Assata Shakur and Nelson Mandela, as well as endorsements of Nation of Islam-leader Louis Farrakhan, intensified the group's affiliation with black nationalism and Farrakhan. It Takes a Nations success helped raise hip hop's profile as both art and sociopolitical statement, amid media criticism of the genre. It helped give hip hop a critical credibility and standing in the popular music community after it had been largely dismissed as a fad since its introduction {{at the turn of}} the 1980s. In promoting the record, Public Enemy expanded their live shows and performing dynamic. With the album's content and the group's rage-filled showmanship in concert, they became the vanguard of a movement in hip hop that reflected a new black consciousness and socio-political dynamic that were taking shape in America at the time.|$|E

25|$|This brings <b>us</b> <b>back</b> to Wittgenstein's {{reliance}} on indirect communication, and his {{reliance on}} thought-experiments. Some philosophical confusions come about because we aren't {{able to see}} family resemblances. We've {{made a mistake in}} understanding the vague and intuitive rules that language uses, and have thereby tied ourselves up in philosophical knots. He suggests that an attempt to untangle these knots requires more than simple deductive arguments pointing out the problems with some particular position. Instead, Wittgenstein's larger goal is to try to divert us from our philosophical problems long enough to become aware of our intuitive ability to see the family resemblances.|$|E
25|$|It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold <b>Us</b> <b>Back</b> is {{the second}} studio album by American hip hop group Public Enemy, {{released}} on June 28, 1988, by Def Jam Recordings. Public Enemy {{set out to make}} the hip hop equivalent to Marvin Gaye's What's Going On, an album noted for its strong social commentary. Recording sessions took place during 1987 at Chung King Studios, Greene St. Recording, and Sabella Studios in New York City. Noting the enthusiastic response toward their live shows, Public Enemy intended with Nation of Millions to make the music of a faster tempo than the previous album for performance purposes.|$|E

The two mountains were used to symbolize the significance of the commandments and serve as a warning to whoever disobeyed them.|$|E
25|$|The {{brothers}} Angus and Malcolm Young formed AC/DC in 1973. The band released two albums in Australia before releasing {{their first}} international effort, High Voltage with vocalist Bon Scott, bassist Mark Evans and drummer Phil Rudd.

Their album Black Ice, released in 2008, sold over 8 million copies worldwide and reached #1 in 29 countries. In 41 years of their career, AC/DC have sold over 200 million albums worldwide, roughly 71 million in the <b>US.</b> <b>Back</b> in Black alone sold 22 million copies (50 million worldwide), and went on to become the second highest-selling album in history.|$|E
25|$|Each hour of {{this day}} is the new {{suffering}} and the new effort of the expiatory suffering of the Savior.

The Holy Church opens before the eyes of believers a full picture of the redeeming suffering of the Lord beginning with the bloody sweat in the Garden of Gethsemane up to the crucifixion on Golgotha. Taking <b>us</b> <b>back</b> through the past centuries in thought, the Holy Church brings us {{to the foot of the}} cross of Christ erected on Golgotha, and makes us present among the quivering spectators of all the torture of the Savior.|$|E
