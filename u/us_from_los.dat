50|$|Before 1964, <b>U.S.</b> 60 ran <b>from</b> <b>Los</b> Angeles to the Arizona state line, {{where it}} {{continued}} its nationwide trek, often overlapping U.S. 99 and U.S. 70 along the way.

50|$|In 1928, sports agent C. C. Pyle {{organized}} {{the first of}} two editions of the 3,455-mile-long Bunion Derby (the first went along <b>U.S.</b> Route 66 <b>from</b> <b>Los</b> Angeles to Chicago before heading toward New York; the 1929 Derby reversed the route).

50|$|The highway's eastern {{terminus}} is in Virginia Beach, Virginia, {{where it}} is known as Pacific Avenue, in the city's Oceanfront resort district {{at the intersection of}} 5th Street and Winston-Salem Avenue. Its original western terminus was in Los Angeles, California, but that was moved to southwest of Brenda, Arizona to an interchange with Interstate 10 (I-10) after the highway designation was removed from California in 1964. Some US 60 signs can be seen at this interchange about 5 mi southwest of Brenda. I-10 replaced <b>US</b> 60 <b>from</b> Beaumont, California to Arizona, and California State Route 60 (SR 60) replaced <b>US</b> 60 <b>from</b> <b>Los</b> Angeles to Beaumont.|$|R

5000|$|Together {{with his}} family, Tanaka {{was sent to}} Manzanar on April 23, 1942, {{under the terms of}} the earlier {{executive}} order. Tanaka characterized the facility as an [...] "outdoor jail," [...] and he was one of what would eventually be 10,000 Japanese Americans, mostly <b>U.S.</b> citizens <b>from</b> <b>Los</b> Angeles County. Located in California's arid Owens Valley in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains, these inmates lived in crude barracks that did little to protect them from frequent dust storms and, in the winter, freezing temperatures. Tanaka reported that [...] "I cannot see how it is possible for any human being of normal impulses to be cooped up within limited confines of barbed wires, watchtowers, and all the atmosphere of internment and not be touched by the bitterness and disillusionment all around him." ...|$|R
5000|$|Before the Golden Gate Bridge was {{completed}} in 1937, there was regular vehicle ferry service across the Golden Gate strait.

5000|$|The airline gained press {{attention}} {{after it}} {{said that it would}} offer $249 <b>U.S.</b> dollar fares <b>from</b> <b>Los</b> Angeles to New York City. The airline announced that it would cater to family travelers who found traditional airlines to be too expensive. In June 1992 Myron Barry Michaels, the chief executive, said that [...] "For the most part, we're looking at the leisure market, although there will be some business traffic, particularly on the San Francisco-Los Angeles sector." [...] The airline announced that it would use [...] "between three and five Boeing 747-100/200s" [...] and that the first routing would go from Las Vegas to Los Angeles to Newark, New Jersey to Miami to Las Vegas. The airline also announced that it was negotiating lease and purchase deals with European and Asian carriers involving parked 747-200s in desert areas and one involving a former Pan Am 747-100.|$|R
25|$|Thus, in 1931, {{what is now}} I-10 east of Los Angeles {{had been}} defined as LR 26 <b>from</b> <b>Los</b> Angeles to Indio and LR 64 from Indio to Arizona. It was signed as <b>US</b> 99 <b>from</b> San Bernardino to Indio, and US 60 came along around 1932 <b>from</b> <b>Los</b> Angeles to Pomona and from Beaumont to Arizona. U.S. Route 70 was {{extended}} west from Arizona ca. 1936 along the whole route to Los Angeles, and, between 1933 and 1942, <b>US</b> 99 moved <b>from</b> <b>US</b> 66 to present I-10 between San Bernardino and Los Angeles, forming a three-way concurrency between Pomona and Los Angeles. Old alignments and names include Valley Boulevard, Ramona Boulevard and Garvey Avenue.|$|R
