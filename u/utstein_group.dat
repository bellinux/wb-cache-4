One of her lasting accomplishments was the {{focusing}} of Dutch assistance to poorer developing countries that have made real commitments to poverty reduction programs and policies. She widened the influence of Dutch assistance policies by helping establish in 1999 the <b>Utstein</b> <b>Group</b> consisting of the Ministers for Development Cooperation of Germany, the United Kingdom, Norway and the Netherlands. The four Utstein countries agreed to collaborate in their approach towards poverty reduction worldwide, by sreamlining their own aid delivery systems and by influencing the international community's policies to combat poverty. Her work as Minister {{and member of the}} Utstein Grouphas received wide international acclaim, including, in 2003, through the award of the first annual Commitment to Development Award by the Center for Global Development in Washington D.C. Recently, the OECD acknowledged that the [...] "Utstein Group" [...] of which she was a member contributed to international development receiving attention beyond the [...] "development community" [...] and making the MDG's the dominant framework for discussing development.|$|E

This retrospective cohort study describes the first 2 years 2 Ì† 7 results from the Irish National Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Register (OHCAR). Methods Data on OHCAs attended by emergency medical services (EMS) where resuscitation was attempted (EMS-treated) were collected from ambulance services and entered onto OHCAR. Descriptive analysis of the study population was performed, and regression analysis was performed on the subgroup of adult patients with a bystander-witnessed event of presumed cardiac aetiology and an initial shockable rhythm (<b>Utstein</b> <b>group).</b> Results 3701 EMS-treated OHCAs were recorded for the study period (1 January 2012 - 31 December 2013). Incidence was 39 / 100 000 population/year. In the <b>Utstein</b> <b>group</b> (n= 577), compared with the overall group, there was a higher proportion of male patients, public event location, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and early defibrillation. Median EMS call-response interval was similar in both groups. A higher proportion of patients in the <b>Utstein</b> <b>group</b> achieved return of spontaneous circulation (35...|$|E
