The service was launched on 26 July 2005 as Ireland's fourth mobile network operator behind Vodafone, O2 and Meteor. 3's coverage {{is made up}} of a single 2,100MHz band <b>UMTS</b> <b>network,</b> with claims of 96% population coverage and 500,000 subscribers. A roaming agreement with Vodafone provides GSM coverage where no UMTS signal is available. Service was initially offered as post-paid only, but on 16 May 2006 the introduction of a pre-paid service, known as 3Pay, was announced. A pre-paid mobile broadband service was launched on 29 February 2008 under the name 3Pay Broadband, with vouchers available for durations of one day, one week, or one month. On 13 May 2010, 3 Ireland announced the launch of the world's first commercial voice and data I-HSPA network. In July 2012, 3 Ireland announced a strategic partnership with Vodafone Ireland to share network infrastructure. This facilitated rapid rollout of 3 Ireland's 4G network, while also making it less costly. When a 3 user is using 2G or Edge connection, they are using Vodafone's 2G network, as 3 are a 3G/HSDPA network only. In November 2012 it was awarded LTE spectrum by auction, along with the three other incumbent network operators. On 24 June 2013, it was announced that Hutchison would acquire Telefónica's Irish mobile operations, O2 for €780 million, to be merged into 3 Ireland upon completion of the deal. As of 2014, The European Commission has agreed to the go ahead of the merge. On 27 January 2014, Three launched their 4G network in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick, Wexford and Waterford. In March 2014, Three.expanded their 4G coverage to Ashbourne, Bray, Carlow, Dunmore East, Kilkenny, Leixlip, Lusk, Rush, Skerries, Swords and Tullamore. As of October 2015 Three Ireland now has a total of over 2 million subscribers after merging with O2 Ireland ...|$|E
