25|$|Countries {{including}} Germany, Austria, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, {{have banned}} {{the disposal of}} <b>untreated</b> <b>waste</b> in landfills.

25|$|In the U.S., the Clean Water Act of 1972 {{mandated}} {{elimination of}} the discharge of <b>untreated</b> <b>waste</b> from municipal and industrial sources to make water safe for fishing and recreation.

25|$|In Europe, {{with the}} ban on {{landfilling}} <b>untreated</b> <b>waste,</b> scores of incinerators have {{been built in the}} last decade, with more under construction. Recently, a number of municipal governments have begun the process of contracting for the construction and operation of incinerators. In Europe, some of the electricity generated from waste is deemed to be from a 'Renewable Energy Source (RES) and is thus eligible for tax credits if privately operated. Also, some incinerators in Europe are equipped with waste recovery, allowing the reuse of ferrous and non-ferrous materials found in landfills. A prominent example is the AEB Waste Fired Power Plant.|$|E

Nevertheless, the environment of developing countries remained deeply polluted by the <b>untreated</b> <b>waste.</b> The Burigana River in Bangladesh is now black in colour and pronounced biologically dead because neighbouring leather tanneries are discharging more than 20000 cubics of liquid waste daily. (Stanko, 2013) The daily life of local people is significantly affected as Buriganga River is their source of bathing, irrigation and transportation. Many workers in the tanneries suffer from serious skin illness since they are exposed to toxic chemicals for long period of time. Air is being highly polluted in such area because the factories do not install proper ventilation facilities. Sweatshops is also an environmental issue as it is not only causing harm to the human right of labour but also their living environment.|$|E
500|$|In 1878 a Thames pleasure-steamer, the , {{collided}} with the collier Bywell Castle and sank, causing over 650 deaths. The accident took place close to the outfalls and questions were raised in the British press over whether the sewage was responsible {{for some of the}} deaths. In the 1880s further fears over possible health concerns because of the outfalls led to the MBW purifying sewage at Crossness and Beckton, rather than dumping the <b>untreated</b> <b>waste</b> into the river, and a series of six sludge boats were ordered to ship effluent into the North Sea for dumping. The first boat commissioned was named the SS Bazalgette, which remained in service until December 1998, when the dumping stopped, and an incinerator was used to dispose of the waste. The sewers were expanded in the late 19th century and again in the early 20th century. The drainage network is, , managed by Thames Water, and is used by up to eightmillion people a day. The company states that [...] "the system is struggling to cope with the demands of 21st-century London".|$|E

The number of inhabitants reaches many millions. Tbwns are the nodes through which flow the main streams of energy and matter. Because of the extreme concentration of people, industrial plant, communal devices and traffic, cities are fundamental sources of environmental threat. In Poland 137 towns drain 82 % of the country’s treated waste production into rivers and 86 % of the <b>untreated</b> <b>wastes.</b> 82. 3 % of the country’s dust pollution and 74. 9 % of gaseous pollution comes from cities...|$|R

[...] Some {{of the most dangerous}} ocean pollutants include toxic metals, PCBs, fertilizers, <b>untreated</b> <b>waste,</b> chemicals, and a variety of petroleum products. Oil spills are particularly dangerous to sea turtles. [...] Although oil does not tend to stick to them as it does to other marine life, sea turtles are still at risk when they surface for air, where oil can get in their eyes, skin, and lungs which can lead to significant health problems. [...] Even if they are not directly in contact with marine pollution, sea turtles can still ingest harmful chemicals through the food they eat. [...] Oil is also a cause for the death of seagrass, which is a large staple in the diet of the green turtle. [...] The diets of the hawksbill sea turtle, loggerhead sea turtle, and Kemp's ridley sea turtle species have also been affected by the oil’s role in the reduction of certain sponges and invertebrates. [...] Extended exposure has been found to deteriorate the health of a sea turtle in general, making it more weak and vulnerable to a variety of other threats.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2015 the Lebanese {{government}} {{signed an}} agreement with Chinook Industrial Mining, part owned by Chinook Sciences, to export over 100,000 tons of <b>untreated</b> <b>waste</b> from [...] Beirut and the surrounding area. The waste had accumulated in temporary locations following the government closure of the county's largest land fill site five months earlier. The contract was jointly signed with Howa International which has offices in Holland and Germany. The contract is reported to cost $212 per ton. The waste, which [...] is compacted and infectious, would have to be sorted and was estimated to be enough to fill 2,000 containers. Initial reports that the waste was to be exported to Sierra Leone have been denied by diplomats. In February 2016 the government withdrew from negotiations after it was revealed that documents relating to the export of the trash to Russia were forgeries. On 19 March 2016, the Cabinet reopened the Naameh landfill for 60 days in line with a plan it passed few days earlier to end the trash crisis. The plan also stipulates the establishment of landfills in Bourj Hammoud and Costa Brava, east and south of Beirut respectively. Sukleen trucks began removing piled garbage from Karantina and heading to Naameh. Environment Minister Mohammad Machnouk announced during a chat with activists that more than 8,000 tons of garbage had been collected so far as part of the government’s trash plan in only 24 hours. The plan's execution is still ongoing.|$|E
2500|$|Legally in the UK, train {{operators}} {{are allowed to}} discharge up to 25 litres of <b>untreated</b> <b>waste</b> at a time on to the track. Most Mk3 carriages have no toilet tanks, discharging directly onto the track. In the 2000s both the RMT trade union and politicians were concerned at {{the environmental impact of}} this legacy issue. The problem was first raised in 2003 after Railtrack staff at [...] abandoned local clean-up and then track maintenance procedures due to an excessive buildup of sewage waste in the area. In 2006 the RMT agreed waste-tank and clean-out developments at Northern Rail's Heaton depot in 2006 with GNER, plus new clean-out procedures at all other depots, to solve an ongoing dispute over the previous 18 months. By 2011, the European Union had started a formal investigation to see whether trains composed of such carriages were breaking EU environmental and health laws, although the Environment Agency confirmed that train companies claimed special exemptions to dump waste along the tracks. In 2013, transport minister Susan Kramer branded the practice [...] "utterly disgusting" [...] and called on the industry to take action. ATOC responded by stating that, as all new vehicles had to be fitted with compliant toilet tanks, with withdrawal of the HSTs by the end of 2017 the problem would be solved. Unless the toilets are modernised, the cascading of stock onto other lines may continue this practice for many years after 2017 (see 'Replacements' section above).|$|E
