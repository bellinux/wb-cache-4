40|$|Using strain {{controlled}} uniaxial loading histories, two viscoplasticity laws, formulated {{by means of}} two different so called overstresses, are discussed. According to the first viscoplasticity law the equilibrium stress is defined to be a rate independent funcional of the strain history. In the second viscoplasticity law the equilibrium stress {{is related to the}} so called static stress. This equilibrium stress can be determined by the property that during a relaxation experiment the actual stress, the static stress and the equilibrium stress converge to the same limit value. It is shown that the two viscoplasticity laws predict different responses for {{strain controlled}} loadings. In order to examine the capabilities of the two viscoplasticity laws, uniaxial tension-compression tests including hold time periods have been carried out. It turns out that the material behavior of bronze, zircaloy and three stainless steels can be described more accuratly by the first viscoplasticity law. On the other hand the material response of <b>unalloyed</b> <b>aluminium</b> and an aluminium alloy can be represented better by the second viscoplasticity law. (orig.)
