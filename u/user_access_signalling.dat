This study reviews current trends in access solution development for children with cerebral palsy, with particular emphasis on the access technology that harnesses a control signal from the user (eg, movement or physiological change) and the output device (eg, augmentative and alternative communication system) whose behavior is modulated by the <b>user’s</b> control <b>signal.</b> <b>Access</b> technologies have advanced from simple mechanical switches to machine vision (eg, eye-gaze trackers), inertial sensing, and emerging physiological interfaces that require minimal physical effort. Similarly, output devices have evolved from bulky, dedicated hardware with limited config-urability, to platform-agnostic, highly personalized mobile applications. Emerging case studies encourage the consideration of access technology for all nonverbal children with cerebral palsy with at least nascent contingency awareness. However, establish-ing robust evidence {{of the effectiveness of}} the aforementioned advances will require more expansive studies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Much {{work has}} been done on characterizing the {{workload}} of a database system. Previous studies focused on providing different types of statistical summaries, and modeling the run-time behavior on the physical resource level as well. In this paper, we focus on characterizing the database system’s workload from the view of database user. We use <b>user</b> <b>access</b> patterns to describe how a client application or a group of <b>users</b> <b>access</b> the data of a database system. The <b>user</b> <b>access</b> patterns include a set of <b>user</b> <b>access</b> events that represent the format of the queries and a set of <b>user</b> <b>access</b> graphs that represent the query execution orders. <b>User</b> <b>access</b> patterns can help database administrators tune the system, help database users optimize queries, and help to predict and cache future queries. In this paper, we will present several approaches to use <b>user</b> <b>access</b> patterns to improve system performance, and report some experimental results. ...|$|R
40|$|Securing {{information}} system becomes {{the highlight of}} technology following quick development of computer networking and the Internet. People have known the method to enforce security over a database, but the necessities to get more secure system never reach boundaries. Now days the trend of {{information system}} is the open connection system where users are able to access system from many places. It leads the involvement of <b>user</b> <b>access</b> control {{as a part of}} database security since it takes a big role in governing access request of each user. This security component serves as a part of defense to secure data contained in the system. Development of <b>user</b> <b>access</b> control began on the early of seventies with DAC technology. Right now technology of <b>user</b> <b>access</b> control has reached sophisticated method with RBAC, but development of organization using information system and the development of information system itself push the improvement of <b>user</b> <b>access</b> control technology. This paper provides information about security system with the emphasis on <b>user</b> <b>access</b> control, which includes DAC, MAC and RBAC and the implementation of each <b>user</b> <b>access</b> control in security model. Comparison of each <b>user</b> <b>access</b> control method is given {{at the end of the}} paper...|$|R
50|$|<b>User</b> <b>access</b> enables <b>users</b> {{to assume}} a {{specific}} digital identity across applications, which enables access controls to be assigned and evaluated against this identity. The use of a single identity for a given user across multiple systems eases tasks for administrators and <b>users.</b> It simplifies <b>access</b> monitoring and verification and allows the organization to minimize excessive privileges granted to one <b>user.</b> <b>User</b> <b>access</b> can be tracked from initiation to termination of <b>user</b> <b>access.</b>|$|R
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of geographic information services, Web Geographic Information Systems (WebGIS) {{have become an}} indispensable part of everyday life; correspondingly, map search engines have become extremely popular with users and WebGIS sites receive a massive volume of requests for <b>access.</b> These WebGIS <b>users</b> and the content accessed have regional characteristics; to understand regional patterns, we mined regional WebGIS <b>user</b> <b>access</b> patterns based on a weighted bipartite network. We first established a weighted bipartite network model for regional <b>user</b> <b>access</b> to a WebGIS. Then, based on the massive <b>user</b> WebGIS <b>access</b> logs, we clustered geographic information accessed and thereby identified hot access areas. Finally we quantitatively analyzed the access interests of regional users and the visitation volume characteristics of regional <b>user</b> <b>access</b> to these hot access areas in terms of <b>user</b> <b>access</b> permeability, <b>user</b> usage rate, and <b>user</b> <b>access</b> viscosity. Our research results show that regional <b>user</b> <b>access</b> to WebGIS is spatially aggregated, and the hot access areas that regional <b>users</b> <b>accessed</b> are associated with specific periods of time. Most regional user contact with hot accessed areas is variable and intermittent but for some <b>users,</b> their <b>access</b> to certain areas is continuous as it is associated with ongoing or recurrent objectives. The weighted bipartite network model for regional <b>user</b> WebGIS <b>access</b> provides a valid analysis method for studying user behaviour in WebGIS and the proposed access pattern exhibits access interest of regional user is spatiotemporal aggregated and presents a heavy-tailed distribution. Understanding <b>user</b> <b>access</b> patterns is good for WebGIS providers and supports better operational decision-making, and helpful for developers when optimizing WebGIS system architecture and deployment, so as to improve the user experience and to expand the popularity of WebGIS...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A Web {{includes}} implementations {{of complex}} business processes. A key challenge in Web services security is to design access control models that can effectively meet the unique security challenges {{posed by the}} Web services environment. Although many access control models have been proposed, there is no much {{work has been done}} for finding efficient techniques for performing access control. This paper attempts to propose Web access control model which control the Web access based on the <b>user</b> <b>access</b> behavior by tracking the Web access history. The active <b>user’s</b> <b>access</b> pattern is matched with <b>user</b> <b>access</b> data discovered from <b>user</b> <b>access</b> history, based on Web usage data in Web server log data using Association rules mining and prefix-projected sequential pattern mining algorithms...|$|R
40|$|The {{regional}} disparities of online map <b>user</b> <b>access</b> volume (use ‘user access volume’ {{in this paper}} to indicate briefly) is a topic of growing interest with the increment of popularity in public users, which helps to target the construction of geographic information services for different areas. At first place we statistically analysed the online map <b>user</b> <b>access</b> logs and quantified these regional access disparities on different scales. The {{results show that the}} volume of <b>user</b> <b>access</b> is decreasing from east to the west in China as a whole, while East China produces the most access volume; these cities are also the crucial economic and transport centres. Then Principal Component Regression (PCR) is applied to explore the {{regional disparities}} of <b>user</b> <b>access</b> volume. A determining model for Online Map access volume is proposed afterwards, which indicates that area scale is the primary determining factor for regional disparities, followed by public transport development level and public service development level. Other factors like user quality index and financial index have very limited influence on the <b>user</b> <b>access</b> volume. According to the study of regional disparities in <b>user</b> <b>access</b> volume, map providers can reasonably dispatch and allocate the data resources and service resources in each area and improve the operational efficiency of the Online Map server cluster...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} in mining <b>user</b> <b>access</b> patterns for predicting Web page requests focuses only on consecutive sequential Web page accesses, i. e., pages which are accessed {{by following the}} hyperlinks. In this paper, we propose a new method for mining <b>user</b> <b>access</b> patterns that allows the prediction of multiple non-consecutive Web pages, i. e., any pages within the Web site. Our approach consists of two major steps. First, the shortest path algorithm in graph theory is applied to find the distances between Web pages. In order to capture <b>user</b> <b>access</b> behavior on the Web, the distances are derived from <b>user</b> <b>access</b> sequences, as opposed to static structural hyperlinks. We refer to these distances as Minimum Reaching Distance (MRD) information. The association rule mining (ARM) technique is then applied to form a set of predictive rules which are further refined and pruned by using the MRD information. The proposed approach is applied as a collaborative filtering technique to recommend Web pages within a Web site. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves performance over the existing Markov model approach in terms of precision and recall, and also has a better potential of reducing the <b>user</b> <b>access</b> time on the Web...|$|R
40|$|Although {{efficient}} {{identification of}} <b>user</b> <b>access</b> sessions from very large web logs is an unavoidable data preparation {{task for the}} success of higher level web log mining, little {{attention has been paid to}} algorithmic study of this problem. In this paper we consider two types of <b>user</b> <b>access</b> sessions, interval sessions and gap sessions. We design two efficient algorithms for finding respectively those two types of sessions with the help of some proposed structures. We present theoretical analysis of the algorithms and prove that both algorithms have optimal time complexity and certain error-tolerant properties as well. We conduct empirical performance analysis of the algorithms with web logs ranging from 100 megabytes to 500 megabytes. The empirical analysis shows that the algorithms just take several seconds more than the baseline time, i. e., the time needed for reading the web log once sequentially from disk to RAM, testing whether each <b>user</b> <b>access</b> record is valid or not, and writing each valid <b>user</b> <b>access</b> record back to disk. The empirical analysis also shows that our algorithms are substantially faster than the sorting based session finding algorithms. Finally, optimal algorithms for finding <b>user</b> <b>access</b> sessions from distributed web logs are also presented...|$|R

However, patient privacy can be vulnerable in a WBAN unless security is considered. <b>Access</b> to authorized <b>users</b> for the correct information and resources for different services can be provided with the help of efficient <b>user</b> <b>access</b> control mechanisms. This paper proposes a new <b>user</b> <b>access</b> control scheme for a WBAN. The proposed scheme makes use of a group-based <b>user</b> <b>access</b> ID, an access privilege mask, and a password.
