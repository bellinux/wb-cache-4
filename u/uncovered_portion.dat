It was built in 1928 to Southern Pacific plans and is similar to canopies at the Sacramento Station in California, and is 23 feet wide. During the peak of passenger train travel in 1927, a tunnel was built under the eleven tracks with stairways to the surface at each platform. Called the passenger subway, this tunnel allowed pedestrians to access all eleven tracks from the Grand Lobby, bypassing those tracks that were occupied by trains.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} a fatal case of late aortic perforation by an endograft-anchoring stent. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 69 -year-old woman presented 2 years after thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair with a 9 -cm dilatation of the descending thoracic aorta proximal {{to the conventional}} aortic graft. A 38 -mm Dacron graft with multiple Gianturco Z-stents sutured inside was placed transluminally across the aortic arch such {{that part of the}} <b>uncovered</b> <b>portion</b> of the proximal stent was partially across the left subclavian orifice. Four months later, the patient died from massive hemorrhage. Autopsy showed that the <b>uncovered</b> <b>portion</b> of the proximal stent had perforated the aortic arch. CONCLUSIONS: This case stresses the need for low-profile stent-grafts and smaller, more flexible introducer systems. Anchoring stents must be flexible, less traumatic, and strong enough to create a watertight seal even in tortuous vessels. To avoid aortic arch damage by thoracic stent-grafts, the proximal stent should be fully covered by the fabric...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the risk and effect of balloon perforation by anchoring barbs and to assess whether these risks are different if the balloon is protected by a covered stent mounted upon it. MethodsA bench-top model was developed to mimic the penetration of anchoring barbs into the lumen of medium sized blood vessels. The model allowed variation of angle and depth of vessel penetration. Both bare balloons and those with covered stents mounted upon them were tested in the model to determine whether there was a risk of perforation and which factors increased or decreased this risk. ResultsAll combinations of barb angle and depth caused balloon perforation but this was most marked when the barb was placed perpendicular to the long axis of the balloon. When the deployment of covered stents was attempted balloon perforation occurred in some cases but full stent deployment was achieved in all cases where the perforation was in the portion of the balloon covered by the stent. The only situation in which stent deployment failed was where the barb was intentionally placed in the <b>uncovered</b> <b>portion</b> of the balloon. This resulted in only partial deployment of the stent. ConclusionsBalloon rupture is a distinct possibility when deploying balloon-expandable stents {{in close proximity to}} anchoring barbs.

Ninety per cent of proteins in the human proteome matched at least one of 5494 manually curated Pfam-A families. In contrast, human residue coverage by Pfam-A families was < 45 %, with 9418 automatically generated Pfam-B families adding a further 10 %. Even after excluding predicted signal peptide regions and short regions (< 50 consecutive residues) unlikely to harbour new families, for 38 % of the human protein residues, there was no information in Pfam about conservation and evolutionary relationship with other protein regions. This <b>uncovered</b> <b>portion</b> of the human proteome was found to be distributed over almost 25 000 distinct protein regions. Comparison with proteins in the UniProtKB database suggested that the human regions that exhibited similarity to thou-sands of other sequences were often either divergent elements or N- or C-terminal extensions of existing families.

Stricture resolution rate was noted to be lowest in chronic pancreatitis. The authors were able to remove all stents after biliary decompression, as confirmed by clinical and laboratory investigation. Median follow-up time after stent removal was 12  months. Stent migration occurred in 14  % of cases, and tissue hyperplasia at the proximal <b>uncovered</b> <b>portion</b> of the stent, resulting in stricture was also noted in some patients [35]. To overcome the limitation of partially covered stents, fully covered self-expandable metal stents were developed and used in benign disease. The efficacy of covered stents in the treatment of anastomotic strictures following OLT is very promising. The stricture resolution rate ranges from 87.5 to 95.5  % at a follow-up period of 6 – 12  months. Recurrence of the stricture occurs in {{a very small number of}} patients.

40|$|Results from a {{numerical}} simulation of the unsteady flow through {{one quarter of}} the circumference of a transonic high-pressure turbine stage, transition duct, and low-pressure turbine first vane are presented and compared with experimental data. Analysis of the unsteady pressure field resulting from the simulation shows the effects of not only the rotor/stator interaction of the high-pressure turbine stage but also new details of the interaction between the blade and the downstream transition duct and low-pressure turbine vane. Blade trailing edge shocks propagate downstream, strike, and reflect off of the transition duct hub and/or downstream vane leading to high unsteady pressure on these downstreamcomponents. The reflection of these shocks from the downstream components back into the blade itself has also been found to increase the level of unsteady pressure fluctuations on the <b>uncovered</b> <b>portion</b> of the blade suction surface. In addition, the blade tip vortex has been found to have a moderately strong interaction with the downstream vane even with the considerable axial spacing between the two blade-rows. Fourier decomposition of the unsteady surface pressure of the blade and downstream low-pressure turbine vane shows the magnitude of the various frequencies contributing to the unsteady loads. Detailed comparisons between the computed unsteady surface pressure spectrum and the experimental data are shown along with a discussion of the various interaction mechanisms between the blade, transition duct, and downstream vane.

The third method places the desired pattern directly on the surface, producing a final product that is ultimately a few nanometers thicker than the original surface. In order to visualize the surface to be fabricated, the surface must be visualized by a nano-resolution microscope, which include the scanning probe microscope (SPM) and the atomic force microscope (AFM).

A numerical model was developed for this process by assuming that adsorption of the surfactant at the ITIES was Langmuirian and that the ET reaction only occurred at the <b>uncovered</b> <b>portion</b> of the ITIES. Theoretical results show that, for typical MEMED conditions, the surfactant adsorption. process attains the diffusion-controlled limit if the rate constant is' greater than 1 cm s(- 1). The inhibitory effect of surfactant adsorption on the ET process produces changes in the reactant concentration profile adjacent to the droplet, which depend on the bulk surfactant concentration, equilibrium constant (K), the maximum surface coverage (Gamma (max)), and the ET kinetics. Methods for determining these parameters are suggested. The effect of Triton X- 100 on the ET reaction was measured over a; wide range of conditions, with bulk aqueous Triton X- 100 concentrations in the range 2. 5 x 10 (- 5) to 2. 5 x 10 (- 4) M, over various time scales. Experimental results were found to be in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions and yielded an ET rate constant of 0. 0020 +/- 0. 0001 cm s(- 1) for the clean interface, with the potential across the ITIES established with 0. 1 M ClO 4 - in each phase. The diminution in the ET rate with surfactant present was consistent with diffusion-controlled surfactant adsorption, characterized by K = 2. 7 x 10 (4) M- 1 and a value of Gamma (max) = 3 x 10 (- 10) mol cm(- 2) ...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [76]- 77). In teleconferencing systems, {{the most}} widely used technique to cancel acoustic echo makes use of an adaptive transversal filter and the least mean square algorithm. This research analyzes the performance of a finite length adaptive transversal filter using different input signals for both full-band and sub-band adaptive filtering techniques. The analysis shows that for a sinusoid input, the mean-square error reduces to zero if the filter order is greater than 2. This result can be extended for a multiple sinusoid signal, in which case the mean-square error reduces to zero if the filter order is greater than 2 K, where K is the number of sinusoidal components. Also, for the same filter order, the speech signal showes higher echo return loss enhancement than that for white noise signal, because the voiced section of speech waveform can be represented as a combination of multiple sinusoids. The residual echo for sinusoid inputs is independent of the length of the echo-path impulse response; however, for white noise input, the residual echo is proportional to the length of the <b>uncovered</b> <b>portion</b> of the echo-path impulse response. The sub-band technique is explored and the analysis of the effect of finite filter length on the performance of the adaptive transversal filter is extended to the sub-band case. The analysis results are verified by computer simulation using both 8 -channel and 16 -channel sub-band structures. Real-time experiments with full-band and 8 -channel sub-band acoustic echo cancellers are performed using speech signals. The results verify that in order to achieve the same performance, the order of the sub-band adaptive filter can be chosen much smaller than that of the full-band acoustic echo canceller. M. S.

40|$|Aim. Endovascular {{repair of}} {{complicated}} type B dissections has evolved as a promising alternative to open repair. Previous {{studies have indicated}} that continued false lumen flow is a predictor of continued aortic dilatation and risk of rupture during follow-up. This multicenter study was conducted to analyze the postoperative changes of the false lumen after endografting of complicated type B dissections. Methods. All patients treated with endovascular stent grafts for thoracic type B dissections at 5 major Vascular Centers in Sweden were identified through local databases. Review of charts and all available pre- and postoperative CT scans were performed to identify demographics, indications for repair as well as postoperative changes of the aorta and false lumen. Results. A total of 129 patients treated for type B dissections between 1994 and December 2005 were identified. Median radiological follow-up was 14 months. Fourteen patients died perioperatively leaving 115 patients available for analysis. Seventy-four of these had CT imaging of sufficient quality for morphological analysis. The vast majority of acute patients were treated for rupture or end-organ ischemia whereas most chronic patients were treated for asymptomatic aneurysms. In 80 % of patients, the false lumen thrombosed along the stent graft but it remained perfused distal to the stent graft fixation in 50 % of patients. Only 5 % of patients presented with aortic enlargement of the stent grafted area when adequate proximal sealing was achieved. The distal, uncovered aorta displayed expansion in 16 % of patients. Conclusions. The stent grafted thoracic aorta after type B dissection appears to be stabilized by covering the primary entry site with a stent graft in the majority of both acute and chronic dissections. The <b>uncovered</b> <b>portion</b> of the aorta distal to the stent graft, however, remains at risk of continuous dilatation. Stent grafting for complicated type B thoracic dissections seems to be a treatment option with reasonable morbidity and mortality even though the incidence of severe complications is still significant...|$|E
40|$|This {{invention}} {{is comprised}} of a method of applying diffraction gratings or images directly {{to the surface of}} a substrate wherein the gratings or images are capable of withstanding high temperatures, pressures, humidity and other such conditions related to materials testing. The method includes coating the surface of the substrate with an uniform layer of metal which is then overlaid with a layer of photo-resist material. Next, after contacting the photo-resist material with a master image containing regions of opacity and transparency, electromagnetic radiation is directed through the master image to expose the photo-resist material such that a contact print of the master image is produced on the photo-resist material. Then, after removing the master image, the photo-resist material is developed so as to remove unhardened portions thereof and leave corresponding portions of the metal layer uncovered. Finally, after removing or etching the <b>uncovered</b> <b>portions</b> of the metal layer, the remaining photo-resist material is removed to produce a metallic diffraction grating or image of predetermined size and pattern {{on the surface of the}} substrate...|$|R

Earlier the determination of the diffusion coefficient was tackled by the NMR technique (ref. 11 and through chronoamperometry (ref. 21, the first method resulted in an order-of-magnitude estimate whereas the second one offered indirect information only. The aim of the present work was the direct experimental determination of the diffusivity of H in WO 3. In order to measure lateral diffusion part of a thin WO 3 film on an Sn 02 /glass substrate was covered with an insulating photo-resist layer then the wafer was immersed in acid solution to sa-turate the <b>uncovered</b> <b>portion</b> with H under potentiostatic condi-tions. Indicated by blue coloration a H concentration profile was formed which was homogeneous in depth and width and showed the shape of a step function perpendicular to the edge of the insulat-ing layer.
