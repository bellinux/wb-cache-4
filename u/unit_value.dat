40|$|Trade <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> are {{commonly}} used as proxies for trade prices in empirical research in international economics. Existing datasets providing international trade <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> for {{a large number of}} countries typically suffer from a number of statistical biases, due to the aggregation of <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> and the harmonization of quantity information. These biases reduce the reliability of <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> as a proxy for trade prices. This paper presents the Trade <b>Unit</b> <b>Values</b> dataset, a new database developed to circumvent these statistical issues. Bilateral trade <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> are computed at a very high level of disaggregation before aggregation into Harmonized-System 6 -digits categories to allow for cross-country comparability. Our processing strategy improves the differentiation of trade prices within product categories, as compared to existing worldwide datasets. A simple econometric analysis shows that <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> in our database are well explained by economic aggregates. UNIT VALUE;TRADE PRICE;INTERNATIONAL TRADE...|$|R
40|$|Household surveys {{frequently}} record only expenditure information. The lack {{of information}} about quantities purchased precludes the possibility of deriving household specific <b>unit</b> <b>values.</b> The aggregate price indexes derived from sources exogenous to the household survey are often not sufficient to identify all parameters and to provide plausible estimates. We use a theoretical result developed by Lewbel (1989) to construct "pseudo" <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> by 1) reproducing the variability of crosssectional price variation using the variability of the budget shares, and 2) adding the variability to the aggregate price indexes published by the national statistical institute. The study estimates a complete quadratic demand system using a time series of cross-sections of Italian household budgets including, in turn, aggregate price indexes and "pseudo" <b>unit</b> <b>values.</b> The {{results show that the}} matrix of compensated price elasticities is negative semidefinite only if "pseudo" <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> are used. In order to have a counterfactual experiment, we then consider a household survey with actual <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> and compare them with "pseudo" <b>unit</b> <b>values.</b> The experiment shows that in most cases "pseudo" values maintain the relevant characteristics of the distribution of actual <b>unit</b> <b>values.</b> Overall, we conclude that "pseudo" <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> are better than aggregate price indexes for sound demand and welfare analysis. <b>Unit</b> <b>values,</b> Cross-section prices, demand analysis, Slutsky matrix properties...|$|R

The approach used to measure exchange rate pass-through is based on cointegration and error-correction modelling and the period of analysis is from 1979 to 1995. Full pass-through from the bilateral Irish pound-Sterling exchange rate and from UK producer costs could not be rejected for total and sectoral import <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> for the sample period 1979 q 1 - 1995 q 4. This implies no role for domestic competing prices in explaining the long-run relationship determining <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> of Irish imports from the UK.

40|$|We {{employ a}} {{vertical}} differentiation model {{to examine the}} potential bias in pricing-to-market results when using export <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> aggregating differentiated products.

Our simulation results support those conceptual findings. Thus, some of the positive pricing-to-market results in the literature could be an artifact of the product heterogeneity embodied in <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> rather than evidence of imperfect competition.

40|$|Price {{competition}} {{is a fundamental}} assumption in modeling trade. Empirical applications often use <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> as proxies for price. This is a problem if <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> cannot explain trade flows consistent with the price competition assumption. The paper determines whether this condition exists in food product trade. Trade balances by product are used to indicate successful competition in trade. Export and import <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> are used to determine if {{competition is}} dominated by price or nonprice competition. Trade flows are then categorized in four ways: successful price competition, unsuccessful price competition, successful nonprice competition, and unsuccessful nonprice competition. This categorization is applied to 372 food products using the Standard International Trade Classification. Nearly 40 % of U. S. food exports could be characterized as dominated by nonprice competition. In those instances, we contend that <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> are not valid proxies for price, thereby limiting their usefulness in traditional import demand estimation and trade policy simulation models. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ...|$|R

Using Portuguese firm-level data {{on exports}} by product and {{destination}} market, {{we find that}} f. o. b. <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> increase systematically with distance, and tend to be higher in shipments to richer nations. These relationships reflect not only the sorting of firms across markets, but also the within-firm variation of <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> across destinations. Within product categories, higher-productivity firms tend to ship greater quantities at higher prices to a given market, consistent with higher quality. In addition, firm productivity tends to magnify {{the positive effect of}} distance on within-product <b>unit</b> <b>values,</b> suggesting that high-productivity, high-quality firms are more able to serve difficult markets.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Two new {{channels}} for the e¤ect of importer income per capita on <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> of trade are proposed. First, to model an {{increased demand for}} quality as income rises a model with utility expanding both in quantity and quality is put forward. Second, the in-creased willingness to pay for necessary goods as more commodities enter the consumption set is modeled in a hierarchic demand system. To discriminate between the two theories and a third existing theory on the increased 8 ̆ 5 nickyness of agents to consume their ideal variety in a circle model, we address the e¤ect of income inequality in the three models. Both in the quality model and the circle model <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> of trade rise with income in-equality, whereas in the hierarchic demand model <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> decline in income inequality. Both with and without correcting for sample selection, we 8 ̆ 5 nd empirically a highly sig-ni cant negative e¤ect of income inequality on <b>unit</b> <b>values,</b> thus providing support for the hierarchic demand model...|$|R

The study brings to the fore the following. First, China is emerging as an important market for component imports relative to component exports. As such the increase in two-way flows of parts and components for further processing and development, implying a shift away from assembly-end operations, remains insignificant. Second, network trade appears to have improved the quality of exports (reflecting the ‘moving up of the value chain’) destined to China, but the gaps between the <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> of export and imports have narrowed in the recent past, implying less product development. network trade, two-way trade, <b>unit</b> <b>values,</b> relative <b>unit</b> <b>values,</b> product upgradin...|$|R
