500|$|In general, USB cables {{have only}} plugs on their ends, while hosts and devices have only receptacles. Hosts almost universally have Type-A receptacles, while devices {{have one or}} another Type-B variety. Type-A plugs mate only with Type-A receptacles, and {{the same applies to}} their Type-B counterparts; they are {{deliberately}} physically incompatible. However, an extension to the USB standard specification called USB On-The-Go (OTG) allows a single port to act as either a host or a device, which is selectable {{by the end of the}} cable that plugs into the receptacle on the OTG-enabled unit. Even after the cable is hooked up and the units are communicating, the two units may [...] "swap" [...] ends under program control. This capability is meant for units such as PDAs in which the <b>USB</b> <b>link</b> might connect to a PC's host port as a device in one instance, yet connect as a host itself to a keyboard and mouse device in another instance.|$|E
50|$|Connecting any two {{computers}} using USB {{requires a}} special proprietary bridge cable. A directly connected pin-to-pin USB type A cable does not work, as USB {{does not support}} such a type of communication. In fact, attempting to do so may even damage the connecting computers, as it will effectively short the two computers' power supplies together by connecting their 5V and GND lines. This can possibly destroy one or both machines and cause a fire hazard since the two machines may not have exactly the same USB source voltage. Therefore, Direct Cable Connection over USB is not possible; a <b>USB</b> <b>link</b> cable must be used, {{as seen in the}} Microsoft knowledge base article 814982. However, with a <b>USB</b> <b>link</b> cable, a program which supports data transfer using that cable must be used. Typically, such a program is supplied with the <b>USB</b> <b>link</b> cable. The DCC wizard or Windows Explorer cannot be used to transfer files over a <b>USB</b> <b>link</b> cable.|$|E
5000|$|Session Request Protocol (SRP): Allows both {{communicating}} {{devices to}} control when the link's power session is active; in standard USB, only the host {{is capable of}} doing so. That allows fine control over the power consumption, which {{is very important for}} battery-operated devices such as cameras and mobile phones. The OTG or embedded host can leave the <b>USB</b> <b>link</b> unpowered until the peripheral (which can be an OTG or standard USB device) requires power. OTG and embedded hosts typically have little battery power to spare, so leaving the <b>USB</b> <b>link</b> unpowered helps in extending the battery runtime.|$|E
5000|$|... {{adapters}} {{with full}} speed <b>USB</b> <b>links</b> {{are probably the}} most common approach, and new products often include high speed USB support. Higher end products often support Ethernet, with the advantage that the debug host can be quite remote. Adapters which support high speed trace ports generally include several megabytes of trace buffer and provide high speed <b>links</b> (<b>USB</b> or Ethernet) to get that data to the host.|$|R

This allows the pilot {{to practice and}} hone their skills before using the real RC model which may be costly exercise {{in the event of}} a crash. Pilots have the ability to plug the controller used to fly the real model to the PC and simulator via a <b>USB</b> <b>link</b> cable thus giving the pilot a better response to the real world controls. Famous pilots include Quique Somenzini, Andrew Jesky, Jason Noll, Frank Noll, Chip Hyde, Mark Leseberg, Gernot Bruckmann.|$|E

50|$|The MimioTeach {{interactive}} whiteboard system is typically {{attached to a}} whiteboard using magnets and to the teacher's PC via a USB connection or through MimioHub, a proprietary wireless <b>USB</b> <b>link.</b> The teacher's PC is then attached to a video projector. A MimioStylus pen is calibrated to the MimioTeach system {{using a combination of}} Ultrasound and Infrared to identify its location. Essentially ultrasonic pulses are timed as transmitted from the MimioStylus and received at two ultrasonic microphones on the MimioTeach. Through Trilateration the location of the stylus is determined, and the tracking data sent to the teacher's PC. The MimioStylus acts as a mouse to allow the user to manipulate the contents of their computer as its displayed on the dry erase board. Unlike traditional interactive board based technologies, such as Resistive Touch, the combination of ultrasound and infrared can scale from small whiteboards to very large ones. In another important differentiator, MimioTeach is portable rather than being a large, heavy electronic whiteboard.|$|E
50|$|The TI-83 Plus Silver Edition is a newer {{version of}} the TI-83 Plus calculator, {{released}} in 2001. Its enhancements are 1.5 MB of Flash memory, a dual-speed 6/15 MHz processor, 96 kB of additional RAM (but TI has yet to code support for the entire RAM into an OS), an improved link transfer hardware, a translucent silver case, and more applications preinstalled. This substantial Flash memory increase is significant. Whereas the TI-83+ can only hold a maximum of 10 apps (or more often less, dependent on size), the Silver Edition can hold up to 94 apps. It also includes a <b>USB</b> <b>link</b> cable in the box. It is almost completely compatible with the TI-83 Plus; the only problems that may arise are with programs (i.e. games) that may run too quickly on the Silver Edition or with some programs which have problems with the link hardware. The key layout is the same.|$|E

40|$|The Universal Serial Bus (USB) {{connection}} {{has become}} the de-facto standard for both charging and data transfers for smart phone devices including Google’s Android and Apple’s iPhone. To further enhance their functionality, smart phones are equipped with programmable USB hardware and open source operating systems that empower them to alter the default behavior of the end-to-end USB communications. Unfortunately, these new capabilities coupled with the inherent trust that users place on the USB physical connectivity {{and the lack of}} any protection mechanisms render <b>USB</b> a insecure <b>link,</b> prone to exploitation. To demonstrate this new avenue of exploitation, we introduce novel attack strategies that exploit the functional capabilities of the <b>USB</b> physical <b>link.</b> In addition, we detail how a sophisticated adversary who has under his control one of the connected devices can subvert the other. This includes attacks where a compromised smart phone poses as a Human Interface Device (HID) and sends keystrokes in order to control the victim host. Moreover, we explain how to boot a smart phone device into USB host mode and take over another phone using a specially crafted cable. Finally, we point out the underlying reasons behind USB exploits and propose potential defense mechanisms that would limit or even prevent such USB borne attacks. 1...|$|R
