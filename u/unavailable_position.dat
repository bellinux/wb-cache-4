50|$|Dead {{reckoning}} {{is today}} implemented in some high-end automotive navigation systems {{in order to}} overcome the limitations of GPS/GNSS technology alone. Satellite microwave signals are unavailable in parking garages and tunnels, and often severely degraded in urban canyons and near trees due to blocked lines of sight to the satellites or multipath propagation. In a dead-reckoning navigation system, the car is equipped with sensors that know the wheel circumference and record wheel rotations and steering direction. These sensors are often already present in cars for other purposes (anti-lock braking system, electronic stability control) and can be read by the navigation system from the controller-area network bus. The navigation system then uses a Kalman filter to integrate the always-available sensor data with the accurate but occasionally <b>unavailable</b> <b>position</b> information from the satellite data into a combined position fix.|$|E
40|$|When {{a muscle}} is activated, the {{increasing}} intracellular Ca 2 + concentration raises {{the proportion of}} troponin C molecules that have Ca 2 + ions bound to their N do-main. The binding of Ca 2 + alters {{the shape of the}} tro-ponin complex and causes some of the tropomyosin molecules to alter their position on the thin filament. This movement exposes binding sites on the actin mono-mers. If myosin heads attach to these sites, the heads can undergo conformational changes and generate force (Gordon et al., 2000; Kobayashi and Solaro, 2005). This basic mechanism is {{complicated by the fact that}} the status of the myosin heads influences the status of the binding sites, and vice versa. For example, a myosin head cannot attach to a binding site that is in the “off” or <b>unavailable</b> <b>position.</b> Similarly, a binding site is less likely to switch off if a myosin head is already bound to it. The binding sites and the myosin heads are therefore dynamically coupled. The functional significance of this coupling depends on the relative speeds at which the binding sites and myosin heads switch between different states. For ex-ample, the activation of a muscle in which the myosin heads cycle much faster than the binding sites change states will be determined primarily by thin filament ki-netics. This will no longer be the case if the cycle times of the binding sites and the cross-bridges become com-parable. In real muscles, the kinetics of individual binding sites and myosin heads are influenced by the status o...|$|E

30|$|The {{majority}} of the proposed clustering algorithms for VANET depend {{on some sort of}} positioning service, usually on a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) such as GPS or its alternatives. But it is a known fact that positioning services are not available everywhere, and even if they are, their accuracy varies significantly [6, 7]. The problematic areas are especially parking structures and tunnels, bridges, city centers with narrow streets and high buildings, narrow valleys, etc. GNSS is also vulnerable to spoofing and jamming attacks [8, 9] that can prevent its correct operation. To avoid the loss of communications in case of <b>unavailable</b> or unreliable <b>positioning</b> services, clustering and other low-level communications should function independently.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe use of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) for {{positioning}} {{has grown}} significantly {{in recent years}} thanks in particular {{to the development of}} several mass-market applications, such as car navigation or mobile positioning. Unfortunately, in difficult environments such as dense urban or indoor areas, GNSS exhibits degraded performances in terms of precision and availability. The use of signals of opportunity is one of the solutions to replace or assist GNSS in those environments. These signals are communication signals that are usually designed to provide a service in dense environment and can thus be used in location where GNSS is <b>unavailable.</b> Several commercial <b>positioning</b> services based on signals of opportunity already exist such as ROSUM with ATSC digital TV signals, or Skyhook with Wi-Fi signal...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Common ISAR radar {{images and}} signals can be reconstructed from much fewer samples than the {{sampling}} theo-rem requires {{since they are}} usually sparse. <b>Unavailable</b> randomly <b>positioned</b> samples can result from heavily corrupted parts of the signal. Since these samples can be omitted and declared as unavailable, {{the application of the}} compressive sensing methods in the recovery of heavily corrupted signal and radar images is possible. A simple direct method for the recovery of unavailable signal samples and the calculation of the restored ISAR image is reviewed. An analysis of the noise influence is performed. For fast maneuvering ISAR targets the sparsity property is lost since the ISAR image is blurred. A nonparametric quadratic time-frequency representations based method is used to restore the ISAR image sparsity. However, the linear relation between the signal and the sparsity domain transformation is lost. A recently proposed gradient recovery algorithm is adapted for this kind of analysis. It does not require the linear relation of the signal and its sparsity domain transformation in the process of unavailable data recovery. The presented methods and results are tested on several numerical examples proving the expected accuracy and improvements.

In the future, the scans will be used togenerate a 3 D map to visualize mineshafts in a well suited way for inspections. This multirotor is designed with the purpose to map mineshafts that areinaccessible to humans, due to safety reasons. To produce a 3 D map of themultirotor surroundings the absolute position is needed. Since the multirotorwill be used in an environment where GPS is <b>unavailable,</b> the <b>positioning</b> issolved by utilizing an IMU and Computer Vision technology with a Rangingdevice.

40|$|This {{study is}} centred upon an {{important}} biological problem concerning the structural organization of mammalian ribosomes that cannot be studied by X-ray analysis because 80 S ribosome crystals are still <b>unavailable.</b> Here, <b>positioning</b> of the mRNA on 80 S ribosomes was studied using mRNA analogues containing the perfluorophenylazide cross-linker {{on either the}} guanosine or an uridine residue. The modi-fied nucleotides were directed to positions from − 9 to + 6 {{with respect to the}} first nucleotide of the P site bound codon by a tRNA cognate to the triplet targeted to the P site. Upon mild UV-irradiation, the modified nucleotides at positions + 4 to + 6 cross-linked to protein S 15 and 18 S rRNA nucleotides A 1823 –A 1825. In addition, modified guanosines in positions + 5 and + 6 also cross-linked to G 626, and in position + 1 to G 1702. Cross-linking from the upstream positions was mainly to protein S 26 that has no prokaryotic homologues. These findings indicate that the tail of mammalian S 15 comes closer to the decoding site than that of its prokaryotic homologue S 19, and that the environments of the upstream part of mRNA on 80 S and 70 S ribosomes differ. On the other hand, the results confirm the widely accepted idea regarding the conserved nature of the decoding site of the small subunit rRNA...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of the Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs) with urban applications are now possible due to the recent solutions (DARPA Grand Challenge) developed to solve the Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) problem: perception, path planning and control. For the last decade, the introduction of GPS systems and vision have been allowed the transposition of SLAM methods dedicated to indoor environments to outdoor ones. When the GPS data are <b>unavailable,</b> the current <b>position</b> of the mobile robot can be estimated by the fusion of data from odometer and/or Inertial Navigation System (INS). We detail in this article {{what can be done}} with an uncalibrated stereo-rig, when it is embedded in a vehicle which is going through urban roads. The methodology is based on features extracted on planes: we mainly assume the road at the foreground as the plane common to all the urban scenes but other planes like vertical frontages of buildings can be used if the features extracted on the road are not enough relevant. The relative motions of the coplanar features tracked with both cameras allow us to stimate the vehicle ego-motion with a high precision. Futhermore, the features which don't check the relative motion of the considered plane can be assumed as obstacles...|$|R
40|$|Indoor {{positioning}} is {{a rapidly}} growing research area, enabling new innovative location-aware applications and user-oriented services. Location Fingerprinting (LF) is the positioning technique of coupling a physical location with observed radio signal measurements. In the terms of indoor LF using Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) {{it refers to the}} use of network measurements from the WLAN Access Points (APs) to tag known locations. A data set is created containing reference fingerprints for the area of interest and is known as a radio map. A radio map can later be used to find a user's location in the area of interest. WLAN infrastructures are vulnerable to many kinds of faults and malicious attacks, including, an attacker jamming the signal from an AP, or an AP becoming <b>unavailable</b> during <b>positioning</b> due to power outage. These faults can be collectively characterized as an AP-failure. In LF positioning systems, AP-failure faults can significantly degrade the performance of a LF system due to the difference between the current fingerprints and radio map created with all APs being available. It is desirable to detect such faulty APs, in order to take actions towards fault-mitigation and restoration, in case of a malicious attack. In this work, we have developed a fault detection algorithm that uses inertial sensors (i. e., accelerometer, magnetometer) available in smartphones to detect AP-failure faults in LF systems. Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) has {{become an integral part of}} all high-end smartphones. IMU can be used to infer location information on the smartphone. The main idea is to have two parallel position streams, the LF positioning and the IMU positioning, and to compare the mean positioning error between the two. Since IMU positioning is fairly accurate once provided with starting coordinates, we use it to detect abnormal behaviour in LF positioning system, such as highly erroneous estimates signifying an AP-failure fault present in the system. The performance of the proposed detection algorithm is evaluated with several real-life AP-related faults. The proposed algorithm exhibits low probability of false alarms in the detection of faulty APs. The conclusion is that using IMU based positioning is an effective and robust solution in terms of fault detection in LF systems...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{standard}} bifrontal {{application of}} the bispectral index (BIS) sensor interferes with the operative field in neurosurgery and plastic surgery. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the standard frontal BIS sensor position with an alternative position across the mandible. Methods: Two BISTM Quatro sensors (Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA, USA) mounted on the frontal and mandib-ular regions were connected to BIS VistaTM monitors on each patient during general anesthesia. Data from each position were collected at awake, loss of consciousness, intubation, incision, every 30 minutes during the intraoperative period and emergence. These data were compared using Bland-Altman and scatter plot analyses. Results: Scatter plot analysis revealed a significant correlation between BIS values of frontal and mandibular positions (R = 0. 869, P = 0. 000), except during emergence (R = 0. 253, P = 0. 077). Bland-Altman analysis revealed a negative bias of 3. 2 with a limit of agreement of 16. 5 /- 22. 9, in which 3. 7 % of the values were outside of the limit of agreement. Ad-ditional values included- 2. 9 (14. 1 /- 8. 3) while patients were awake,- 21. 7 (14. 9 /- 58. 3) at loss of consciousness,- 1. 8 (9. 0 /- 12. 5) during maintenance, and- 1. 9 (14. 9 /- 18. 8) during emergence. Conclusions: Overall, BIS values do not agree between the standard frontal position and an alternative mandibular posi-tion. However, during the anesthesia maintenance period, the mandibular position can be availably used as an alternative position if the operative field renders the standard frontal <b>position</b> <b>unavailable.</b> (Korean J Anesthesiol 2014; 66 : 267 - 273...|$|R
40|$|Today, Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) {{still have}} a low market share in logistics, {{compared}} to manual forklifts. We identified {{one of the main}} bottlenecks in the rather long deployment time which involves precise 2 D mapping of the plant, 3 D geo-referencing of pick-up/ drop positions and the manual design of the roadmap. The long deployment time has various reasons: in state-of-the-art plant installations, designated infrastructure is still necessary for the localization; the mapping process requires highly skilled personnel; in many cases <b>unavailable</b> or inappropriate <b>position</b> information of drop points for goods must be corrected on site. Finally, the design of the roadmap, performed by expert technicians is manually optimised in a tedious process to achieve maximum flow of goods for the plant operator. In total the setup of a plant to be ready for AGV operation is taking several months, binding highly skilled technicians and involves very time-consuming and costly on-site procedures. Therefore, we present an approach to AGV deployment which aims to drastically reduce the time, cost and involved personnel. First, we propose the employment of a novel, industrial-ready SICK 3 D laser scanning technology in order to build an accurate and consistent virtual representation of the whole warehouse environment. By utilizing suitable segmentation and processing a semantic map is generated that contains 3 D geo-referenced positions as well as a 2 D localization map eliminating the need for dedicated solution to 2 D mapping. Second, the semantic map provides a free space map which is used as a basis for the automatic roadmap creation in order to achieve optimal flow. So, this paper proposes an innovative methodology for obtaining, in a semi-automated manner, the map of an industrial environment where a system of multiple AGVs will be installed with less time and cost...|$|R

Location-based services (LBS) have become a big application which provide position related services to the mass market.

The collaborative positioning aspect is examined from three aspects, the network geometry, the network size and the P 2 P ranging measurement accuracy. Both theoretical and experimental results indicate that a collaborative network with a low dilution of precision (DOP) value could achieve better positioning accuracy. While increasing sensors and users will reduce DOP, it will also increase computation load which is already a disadvantage of particle filters. The most effective collaborative positioning network size is thus identified and applied. While the positioning system measurement error is constrained by the accuracy of the P 2 P ranging constraint, the work in this thesis shows that even low accuracy measurements can provide effective constraint as long as the system is able to identify the different qualities of the measurements. The proposed collaborative positioning algorithm constrains both inertial measurements and Wi-Fi fingerprinting to enhance the stability and accuracy of positioning result, achieving metre-level accuracy. The application of collaborative constraints also eliminate the requirement for indoor map matching which had been a very useful tool in particle filters for indoor positioning purposes. The wall constraint can be replaced flexibly and easily with relative constraint. Simulations and indoor trials are carried out to evaluate the algorithms.
