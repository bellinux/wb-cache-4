The meat of normal <b>uncastrated</b> roosters {{has a tendency}} to become coarse, stringy and tough as the birds age. This process does not occur in the capon. As caponized roosters grow more slowly than intact males, they accumulate more body fat. The concentration of fat in both the light and dark areas of the capon meat is greater than in that of the <b>uncastrated</b> males.

50|$|Humans {{commonly}} castrate {{domestic animals}} not intended for breeding.Domestic animals are usually castrated to avoid unwanted or uncontrolled reproduction; {{to reduce or}} prevent other manifestations of sexual behaviour such as defending the herd from humans and other threats, or intra-herd aggression (e.g. fighting between groups of entire (<b>uncastrated)</b> males of a species); or to reduce other consequences of sexual behavior that may make animal husbandry more difficult, such as boundary/fence/enclosure destruction when attempting to get to nearby females of the species.|$|E
50|$|Other {{than the}} few bulls needed for breeding, the vast {{majority}} of male cattle are slaughtered for meat before the age of three years, except where they are needed (castrated) as work oxen for haulage. Most of these beef animals are castrated as calves to reduce aggressive behavior and prevent unwanted mating, although some are reared as <b>uncastrated</b> bull beef. A bull is typically ready for slaughter one or two months sooner than a castrated male or a female, and produces proportionately more, leaner muscle.|$|E
50|$|The Biellese was {{formerly}} considered a dual-purpose breed, yielding meat and wool; {{it is now}} kept now principally for meat production. Lambs are usually slaughtered at a weight of 12-15 kg, or rarely at 18-20 kg. Some wether mutton from castrated animals slaughtered at 12-18 months is sold in the markets of Milan and Ravenna; there is demand from some immigrant communities for large entire (<b>uncastrated)</b> lambs. The wool is of carpet quality; rams yield about 3.5 kg, ewes about 3 kg, per year.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "colt" [...] only {{describes}} {{young male}} horses {{and is not}} to be confused with foal, which is a horse of either sex less than one year of age. Similarly, a yearling is a horse of either sex between the ages of one and two. A young female horse is called a filly, and a mare once she is an adult animal. In horse racing, particularly for Thoroughbreds in the United Kingdom, a colt is defined as an <b>uncastrated</b> male from the age of two up to and including the age of four.|$|E
50|$|Pigs are {{slaughtered}} {{at different}} ages. Generally {{they can be}} divided into piglets, which are 1.5 to 3 months old; the fattening pigs, intended for pork and bacon, which are 4 months to one year old; and finally the older pigs, such as sows (female pigs) and boars (<b>uncastrated</b> male pigs). The meat obtained from piglets is subdivided into more meaty or more fatty, determined by the thickness of bacon. Male hogs are usually castrated a month before slaughter. Their meat quality is determined on the mass of halves and the thickness of bacon on the back.|$|E
50|$|Chemical {{castration}} {{is used in}} {{some countries}} and states to treat male sex offenders. Unlike physical castration, it is reversible by stopping the medication. For male sex offenders with severe or extreme paraphilias, physical castration appears to be effective. It results in a 20-year re-offense rate of less than 2.3 percent (versus 80 percent in the untreated control group), according to a large 1963 study involving a total of 1036 sex offenders by the German researcher A. Langelüddeke. This was much lower than otherwise expected, compared with overall sex offender recidivism rates. Although considered {{cruel and unusual punishment}} by many, physical castration does not otherwise affect the lifespan of men (compared with <b>uncastrated</b> men).|$|E

Slaughter of bulls or bullocks of over 15 {{years of age or}} permanently incapacitated for work or breeding due to injury, deformity or any incurable disease is permitted. The law also bans the export of cows, calves, bulls and bullocks from Bihar, for any purpose.

50|$|An {{exception}} to this practice was in 17th and 18th century French opera where it was traditional to use <b>uncastrated</b> male voices both for the hero and for malevolent female divinities and spirits.

In Rameau's 1733 Hippolyte et Aricie, the hero (Hippolyte) was sung by an haute-contre, while {{the roles of the}} three Fates and Tisiphone were scored for basses and tenors. The remaining female roles in both operas were sung by women. The title role of the vain but ugly marsh nymph in Rameau's Platée is also for an haute-contre.|$|E

40|$|The {{castration}} of most male animals {{seems to}} have been the rule in ancient Greece when rearing cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs; only very few adult males are needed for breeding purposes and flocks of bulls, rams, billy-goats and boars are difficult to keep, since they are too aggressive.  Castrated males yield more and fattier meat, and, in the case of sheep, more wool. Still, sacred laws and sacrificial calendars stipulate the sacrifice of <b>uncastrated</b> victims, and vase-paintings frequently represent bulls, rams and billy-goats in ritual contexts. This paper will discuss the role of <b>uncastrated</b> male animals in Greek cult in the Archaic, Classical and Hellenistic periods, both from a religious and an agricultural perspective.  Of particular interest are the relations between the practical, economic reality and the theological perception of sacrifice.
