NLP's creators claim {{there is a connection}} between neurological processes (neuro-), language (linguistic) and behavioral patterns learned through experience (programming), and that these can be changed to achieve specific goals in life. Bandler and Grinder also claim that NLP methodology can [...] "model" [...] the skills of exceptional people, allowing anyone to acquire those skills. They claim as well that, often in a single session, NLP can treat problems such as phobias, depression, tic disorders, psychosomatic illnesses, near-sightedness, GINA: [...] I have seen you demonstrate a technique that some people refer to as Dr. Bandler's Beauty treatment? Please tell <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> RICHARD : [...] Basically what happened is that I noticed that when I hypnotically regress people repeatedly they looked younger. So I started first thinking, well isn't there a way to maintain that. I noticed when I hypnotically regressed people to before the age of 5, who currently wore glasses, didn't need them to see. So I started leaving people's eyes young and growing the rest of them up to the present and it would change the prescription of their glasses radically {{to the point where they}} could see better. And done enough times, some of them could see without glasses. So I went a little step further, and did a DHE (Design Human Engineering™) treatment where we set up a mechanism in the back of their mind that repeatedly age regresses them hypnotically; when they sleep, when they blink, all kinds of things and in a state of time distortion. And it can take years off the way people look, it also ups their energy level and in some cases the bi product [...] has been they recovered spontaneously from very serious diseases. Because they were aged regressed to where before the disease started. Now I cannot prove that but I've seen it enough times that I'm impressed with it.}} allergy, common cold, and learning disorders.|$|E

6000|$|There {{are many}} things that show with what an heart mercy is of God extended, as is afore described, to Israel for his salvation; but this, that it acteth with rejoicing, that it saveth with rejoicing, and gets the victory over {{judgment}} with rejoicing! is a wonderful one, and one that should be taken notice of by Israel, for his encouragement to hope.

6000|$|... "Of {{course we}} got your letters," [...] she said, [...] "telling {{us how you}} had been made an officer and then a captain.

6000|$|... "It {{was better}} to be sure. Poyor was so careful to caution <b>us</b> <b>about</b> a noise <b>that</b> I was afraid he knew {{some of them were}} lurking near by. It is all right, however, and we can congratulate {{ourselves}} on a fortunate escape from more than one danger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then please {{wear these}} {{spectacles}} during your {{interview with the}} minister of police," [...] said the boy.

6000|$|... "I'm {{sure that}} all I know is that she arrived {{in the morning and}} died in the evening without further parley. What Oak and Mr. Boldwood told me was only these few words. 'Little Fanny Robin is dead, Joseph,' Gabriel said, looking in my face in his steady old way. I was very sorry, and I said, 'Ah!--and how did she come to die?' 'Well, she's dead in Casterbridge Union,' he said, 'and perhaps 'tisn't much matter about how she came to die. She reached the Union early Sunday morning, and died in the afternoon--that's clear enough.' Then I asked what she'd been doing lately, and Mr. Boldwood turned round to me then, and left off {{spitting}} a thistle with the end of his stick. He told me about her having lived by seampstering in Melchester, as I mentioned to you, and that she walked therefrom {{at the end of last}} week, passing near here Saturday night in the dusk. They then said I had better just name a hint of her death to you, and away they went. Her death might have been brought on by biding in the night wind, you know, ma'am; for people used to say she'd go off in a decline: she used to cough a good deal in winter time. However, 'tisn't much odds to <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> now, for 'tis all over." ...|$|E
6000|$|They listened, full of curiosity, {{nodding in}} the pauses their rough pensive faces. Donkin {{opened his mouth}} once or twice, but {{restrained}} himself. Jimmy lay still with open eyes {{and not at all}} interested. A seaman emitted the opinion that after a verdict of atrocious partiality [...] "the bloomin' beaks go an' drink at the skipper's expense." [...] Others assented. It was clear, of course. Donkin said:--"Well, six weeks ain't much trouble. You sleep all night in, reg'lar, in chokey. Do it on my 'ead." [...] "You are used to it ainch'ee, Donkin?" [...] asked somebody. Jimmy condescended to laugh. It cheered up every one wonderfully. Knowles, with surprising mental agility, shifted his ground. [...] "If we all went sick what would become of the ship? eh?" [...] He posed the problem and grinned all round.--"Let 'er go to 'ell," [...] sneered Donkin. [...] "Damn 'er. She ain't yourn."--"What? Just let her drift?" [...] insisted Knowles in a tone of unbelief.--"Aye! Drift, an' be blowed," [...] affirmed Donkin with fine recklessness. The other did not see it--meditated.--"The stores would run out," [...] he muttered, [...] "and... never get anywhere... and what about payday?" [...] he added with greater assurance.--"Jack likes a good pay-day," [...] exclaimed a listener on the doorstep. [...] "Aye, because then the girls put one arm round his neck an' t'other in his pocket, and call him ducky. Don't they, Jack?"--"Jack, you're a terror with the gals."--"He takes three of 'em in tow to once, like one of 'em Watkinses two-funnel tugs waddling away with three schooners behind."--"Jack, you're a lame scamp."--"Jack, tell <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> one with a blue eye and a black eye. Do."--"There's plenty of girls with one black eye along the Highway by..." ...|$|E
6000|$|That {{evening the}} first mate said to Stephen: “The captain {{has been telling}} <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> bag of money you got hold of, Steve, and we all think that your offer to treat {{it as if it}} were prize-money is a very kind one, but we agree with him that it would be a mistake. In the first place, the money wouldn’t go far. In any matter of that sort the ship, that is to say the owners, take a large share to begin with, the {{officers}} take some shares, and the men’s shares would not come to a pound a head. A pound a head would only suffice for them to have a drunken spree on shore, but they are just as well without that, and, as the captain says, it is astonishing what little things upset sailors’ minds. They might take it into their head that as you got two hundred pounds in that hut there might be a lot more, and they would be wanting to land and to turn the village upside down, and there would be bloodshed and all sorts of trouble. The old saying, ‘Least said, soonest mended’, comes in here strongly. We have, so far, got on very well with the natives this voyage, and I hope that we shall continue to do so to the end. I quite allow that we should all of us be glad to give a sharp lesson to that village ashore. They have been plundering, and I have no doubt murdering, the crew of some ship. Still, we have no evidence of that, and we can’t attack the village on mere supposition. They have been friendly enough with us, partly because we have been here before, and the captain gets on well with them, but more because they are perfectly well aware that we are always on guard, and that there is no chance whatever of their catching us asleep. In nine cases out of ten it is the carelessness and over-confidence of sailors that tempt the natives to take advantage of it; they would never have shown you these things if they had had any idea of attacking us.” ...|$|E
