50|$|The <b>pomarine</b> <b>jaeger</b> (Stercorarius pomarinus), <b>pomarine</b> skua, or pomatorhine skua, is a seabird in the skua family Stercorariidae. It is a migrant, {{wintering}} at sea in {{the tropical}} oceans.|$|R
50|$|Hanna Shoal {{is also an}} {{important}} foraging area for many bird species. Species that have been identified in this region are black-legged kittiwake, black guillemot, crested auklet, glaucous gull, ivory gull, northern fulmar, <b>pomarine</b> <b>jaeger,</b> and Ross’s gull.|$|R
50|$|The lake is {{populated}} with silver charr It is {{designated as a}} Key Habitat Site {{because of the high}} density of nesting king eiders. In addition, notable populations of Arctic tern, cackling goose, long-tailed duck, Pacific loon, <b>pomarine</b> <b>jaeger,</b> and Sabine's gulls frequent the area.|$|R
50|$|The mtDNA {{difference}} between the <b>pomarine</b> <b>jaeger</b> and the great skua {{is one of the}} smallest between any two vertebrate species yet analyzed, being less than the variation found between different individuals of widespread species. The apparent capability for hybridization has led to the abolition of the separate genus Catharacta for the Southern Hemisphere and great skuas.|$|R

50|$|Genetic {{studies have}} found {{surprising}} similarities between the great skua and the pomarine skua, despite their dissimilar appearance. Many ornithologists now believe either that the great skua originated as a hybrid between the pomarine skua {{and one of the}} southern-hemisphere species, presumably as a result of vagrancy or migration across the equator by the southern species, or that the pomarine skua evolved from hybridization of the great skua and one of the small Arctic species (see <b>pomarine</b> <b>jaeger</b> for details).|$|R
5000|$|The word [...] "jaeger" [...] {{is derived}} from the German word Jäger, meaning [...] "hunter". The genus name Stercorarius is Latin and means [...] "of dung"; the food disgorged by other birds when pursued by skuas was once thought to be excrement. The {{specific}} Pomatorhinus is from Ancient Greek poma, pomatos, [...] "lid" [...] and rhis, rhinos, [...] "nostrils". This refers to the cere, which the <b>pomarine</b> <b>jaeger</b> shares with the other skuas. The name of this species is unrelated to the Baltic Sea region of Pomerania, ...|$|R
40|$|The 2000 NOU Fall Field Days were he It on 8 - 10 September in Ogballala. Most of {{the field}} trips focused on Lake McConaughy and the {{surrounding}} sites, which is {{where most of the}} birds were. An excellent total of 162 species was found, including the following rarities: a Pacific Loon, 2 Rednecked Grebes, 2 Ruddy Turnstones, a flock of 5 Red Knots, 2 <b>Pomarine</b> <b>Jaegers,</b> an adult Lesser Black-backed Gull, 1 - 2 juvenile Sabine 2 ̆ 7 s Gulls, Plumbeous and Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s vireos, and Townsend 2 ̆ 7 s and MacGillivray 2 ̆ 7 s warblers...|$|R
50|$|The Lonicera fly, {{a hybrid}} in the genus Rhagoletis, is a North American fruit fly {{of the family}} Tephritidae. Its larvae feed on the berries of species of {{introduced}} honeysuckle (Lonicera) that were brought to America within the last 250 years as ornamental plants. A research team led by Dietmar Schwarz has argued that it most likely developed within that time by hybridization of two other species: R. mendax, the blueberry maggot, and R. zephyria, the snowberry maggot. Few cases of animal species arising from hybridization are known (see <b>pomarine</b> <b>jaeger</b> or Mariana mallard), although with DNA analysis more are being found.|$|R
5000|$|Light-morph adult <b>pomarine</b> <b>jaegers</b> have a brown back, mainly white underparts {{and dark}} primary wing {{feathers}} {{with a white}} [...] "flash". The head and neck are yellowish-white with a black cap. Dark morph adults are dark brown, and intermediate morph birds are dark with somewhat paler underparts, head and neck. All morphs have the white wing flash, which appears as a diagnostic double flash on the underwing. In breeding adults of all morphs, the two central tail feathers are much longer than the others, spoon-shaped, and twisted from the horizontal. Juveniles are even more problematic to identify, and are difficult to separate from parasitic jaegers at a distance on plumage alone.|$|R
50|$|Birds include brant goose, snowy owl, {{parasitic}} <b>jaeger,</b> long-tailed <b>jaeger,</b> <b>pomarine</b> <b>jaeger,</b> {{and common}} raven. Thayer's gull and glaucous gull {{are to be}} found here also, but the island is most notable for ivory gull, found on Seymour Island from May to September. The gulls of Seymour Island breed on raised beaches unlike other Canadian ivory gull colonies. The island supports Canada’s largest known ivory gulls breeding colony, approximately 10-12 percent of the known Canadian population. In 2005, Gilchrist and Mallory postulated that Seymour Island gulls may represent forty percent of the surviving Canadian population of this species. The Seymour Island population represents approximately one percent of the world population of ivory gulls.|$|R

5000|$|This species {{ranges from}} 46 to 67 cm in length, 110 to 138 cm in {{wingspan}} and 540 - 920 g in weight. The upper {{limit of the}} length includes the elongated tail streamer of breeding adults, which is about 10 cm in length. Identification of this jaeger is complicated by its similarities to parasitic jaeger {{and the existence of}} three morphs. <b>Pomarine</b> <b>jaegers</b> are larger than common gulls. They are much bulkier, broader-winged and less falcon-like than the parasitic jaeger, but show the same wide range of plumage variation. The flight is more measured than that of the smaller species. It has many harsh chattering calls and others which sounds like which-yew.|$|R
40|$|Birds species {{identification}} from {{images is}} an important and challenging task. This project represents the preliminary study of bird recognition and focusing on three species of garden birds in Malaysia which is Frigatebird, <b>Pomarine</b> <b>Jaeger</b> and Caspian Tern. Birds are chose as they are much easier to monitor compared to other species. However, some might have problems especially ornithologists in identifying birds and sometimes removing {{the background of the}} image can be complex as identification itself. Therefore, this project proposed a technique to segment garden birds which is edge detection or specifically Canny Edge Detection. Canny is one of the mostly used technique because it performs better compared to other technique. The proposed technique will first acquire an image that is loaded from computer. Next the image will go through Canny’s processes which is smoothing, finding the gradient in the x direction and y direction, non-maximum suppression and hysteresis. Last but not least, the result of the Canny’s processes is shown. The final image is then tested using Area Overlap. Experimental results showed that each garden species obtain positive and satisfying result. Frigatebird achieved an average of 97. 9525 %, <b>Pomarine</b> <b>Jaeger</b> achieved 98. 3648 % and Caspian Tern achieved 98. 0448 %. As a conclusion, Canny is proved as a good technique to segment garden birds. As mentioned earlier, this project is a preliminary study so a few features can be added such as recognition of the garden bird species. This project is believe to able give a knowledge value for ornithologists on preliminary steps of bird detection and yet contribute better knowledge on garden bird species in Malaysia. In addition, few features can be considered to be added to this project which is recognition of the garden birds and also to develop it in a mobile application...|$|R
5000|$|Its {{relationships}} {{are not fully}} resolved; its mitochondrial DNA is most similar to the great skua, but from morphology and behavior, it {{is closer to the}} lesser skuas (such as the parasitic jaeger). The most likely explanation is extensive hybridization between the great and one species of lesser skuas, which resulted in a hybrid population that eventually evolved into a distinct species, the pomarine jaeger; or alternatively between the pomarine and a species of Southern Hemisphere skua, with the great skua being the hybrid offspring, perhaps appearing as recently as the 15th century. Judging from characteristics of the skeleton and behavior, the former seems more likely, as the <b>pomarine</b> <b>jaeger</b> shares several similarities with the [...] "Catharacta" [...] skuas, while the great skua does not seem much different from its Southern Hemisphere relatives.|$|R

5000|$|Identification is {{complicated}} by similarities to long-tailed <b>jaeger</b> and <b>pomarine</b> <b>jaeger,</b> {{and the existence of}} three colour morphs. Small for a skua, the parasitic jaeger measures 41 - 48 cm in length, 107 - 125 cm in wingspan and weighs 300 - 650 g. The tail streamer of the breeding adult accounts for about 7 cm of their length. Light-morph adults have a brown back, mainly white underparts and dark primary wing feathers with a white [...] "flash". The head and neck are yellowish-white with a black cap and there is a pointed central tail projection. Dark-morph adults are dark brown, and intermediate-phase birds are dark with somewhat paler underparts, head and neck. All morphs have the white wing flash.Identification of juveniles is even more problematic, {{and it is difficult to}} separate parasitic jaegers from long-tailed jaegers. Parasitic jaegers are bulkier, shorter-winged, and less tern-like than long-tailed jaegers. They are usually warmer toned, with browner shades, rather than grey. However, they show the same wide range of plumage variation. The flight is more falcon-like.|$|R
50|$|Great skuas measure 50 - 58 cm {{long and}} have a 125 - 140 cm wingspan. One study found that 112 males weighed an average of 1.27 kg and that 125 females weighed an average of 1.41 kg. Adults are a {{streaked}} greyish brown, with a black cap, while juveniles are a warmer brown and unstreaked below. They have a short, blunt tail, and a powerful flight. The great skua's call is a harsh hah-hah-hah-hah; quacking and croaking noises have also been heard. Distinguishing this skua from the other North Atlantic skuas (parasitic <b>jaeger,</b> <b>pomarine</b> <b>jaeger</b> and long-tailed jaeger) is relatively straightforward. The herring gull size, massive barrel chest and white wing flashes of this bird are distinctive even at a distance. It is sometimes said {{to give the impression}} of a common buzzard. Identification of this skua is only complicated when it is necessary to distinguish it from the closely related large southern-hemisphere skuas. Despite its name, the great skua is marginally smaller on average than the other 3 large southern-hemisphere skuas, although not by enough to distinguish them by size in the field. Some authorities still regard the great skua as conspecific with some of these southern skuas, and as a group they have sometimes been separated in the genus Catharacta, although currently this taxonomy is not commonly followed.|$|R
50|$|This is a {{relatively}} long-living bird. The maximum recorded age for a wild great black-backed gull is 27.1 years. This species is rarely kept in captivity, but domestically kept European herring gulls {{have been known to}} live for over 44 years and generally larger birds can outlive smaller ones. Mortality typically occurs {{in the early stages of}} life, when harsh weather conditions (including flooding) and starvation can threaten them, as well as predators. Chicks and eggs are preyed on by crows (Corvus ssp.), cats (Felis catus), other gulls, raccoons (Procyon lotor) and rats (Rattus ssp.). The bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), white-tailed eagle (H. albicilla) and golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) are the only birds known to habitually predate healthy, fully grown great black-backed gulls. A great skua (Stercorarius skua) was filmed in Scotland unsuccessfully attempting to kill a second or third year great black-backed gull. On the other hand, the slightly smaller <b>pomarine</b> <b>jaeger</b> (S. pomarinus) has been observed to have been predated by great black-backed gulls. In Norway, great black-backed gulls have been reported to fall prey to Eurasian eagle-owls (Bubo bubo). Killer whales (Orcinus orca) and sharks also reportedly prey upon adult and juvenile birds at sea. In some biomes, where large eagles are absent the great black-backed gull may be considered the apex predator.|$|R
40|$|FALL 1991 OCCURRENCE REPORT During {{the period}} from 1 July to 31 December 1991, 292 species plus a {{probable}} escape were recorded in the state. This compares with 284 species {{for the same period}} in 1990, 291 species in 1989, 282 species in 1988, 296 in 1987, and 293 in 1986. Tables are arranged in a west-to-east fashion, following major river valleys where possible. The whooping crane and Christmas Count reports, found in other parts of this issue, are not included in this report. Weather in this period was noteworthy. Most reporters noted a significant drop in bird populations after the late October ice and snow storm. A comment from Father Thomas Hoffman typifies those made by NOD reporters: 2 ̆ 2 After the Halloween ice/snow storm, Great Blue Herons, Robins, Goldfinches, all sparrows except Juncos and an occasional Tree Sparrow simply disappeared. House and Purple Finches never appeared. A second ice storm in NW Saunders County wreaked havoc on trees the day after Thanksgiving. In spite of the generally very warm January and February, winter birding has been miserable at Wolf Lake. 2 ̆ 2 Countering this trend was the influx of northern gulls and seabirds. The <b>Pomarine</b> <b>Jaeger</b> in Lancaster County was most noteworthy, but Glaucous and Iceland Gulls also appeared. Early in January a Lesser Black-backed Gull was reported in Lancaster County. The Keith County December records of gulls, scoters, and Oldsquaw are also quite exciting...|$|R
40|$|On 5 October, 1997, {{we joined}} Joel G. Jorgensen and John Sullivan for a pelagic trip on Lake McConaughy. A similar trip in late September 1996 yielded a Sabine 2 ̆ 7 s Gull, {{but we were}} really hoping to see a jaeger. From 7 : 00 to 8 : 30 a. m. we {{gradually}} worked our way from the dam towards {{the western end of}} the lake. Besides moderate numbers of Franklin 2 ̆ 7 s and Ring-billed Gulls, there were few birds on the lake. At approximately 8 : 45 a. m. Dinsmore noticed that all of the gulls at the western end of the lake had suddenly taken flight. Less than a minute later, we simultaneously spotted a jaeger soaring directly overhead. The size, dark coloration, and prominent white flashes in the Wings identified the bird as a jaeger. The bird made a couple of attacks on Franklin Gulls and then flew east down the lake. We chased the jaeger for more than ten miles before losing it. We relocated the bird a short time later just above the dam. This time, the bird attacked a couple of Ring-billed Gulls before flying west up the lake. We again took chase, but lost the bird before reaching Lemoyne. The gull-like shape, generally brown coloration, and prominent white bases to the primaries identified the bird as a jaeger. The bird was smaller but longer-winged than a Ring-billed Gull and larger and slimmer than a Franklin 2 ̆ 7 s Gull. The overall coloration was dark brown, except for some warmer rufous tones on the underparts. We saw no visible barring on the underparts. The bill was straight and slender, but the color pattern was not noted. The upperwing was dark brown except for white at the base of at least the outermost four primaries. The underwing was also dark except for a prominent white area on the undersides of the bases of the primaries. The rectrices were dark and the central feathers were slightly elongated with pointed tips. We all agreed on the identification as a juvenile Parasitic Jaeger. Careful size comparisons to Franklin and Ring-billed Gulls eliminated juvenile <b>Pomarine</b> <b>Jaeger,</b> which also generally shows more white color on both surfaces of the wing. Juvenile Long-tailed Jaeger was eliminated {{on the basis of the}} pattern of white on the wing and size and wing proportions. We further concluded the bird was an intermediate or dark morph individual based on the dark plumage and lack of a contrasting paler head or rump. This represents the second accepted record of a Parasitic Jaeger for Nebraska. The only other record is of a juvenile picked up alive in Sheridan County on 23 Aug 1968 which died the next day (specimen number UNSM ZM 12309) (Gates, Doris. 1969. Parasitic Jaeger rather than Skua. Nebraska Bird Review 37 : 31.). There are also five records of <b>Pomarine</b> <b>Jaegers</b> and a single Long-tailed Jaeger record for Nebraska. Another 16 reports are of jaegers that were not identified to species...|$|R
40|$|The Long-tailed Jaeger is an {{accidental}} migrant in Nebraska {{with just one}} accepted record through the mid- 1990 s. Based on records from adjacent states, especially Colorado (Andrews and Righter 1992) and Wyoming (Faulkner 2010), the species is probably more frequent than these records indicate, and its status is further complicated by possible confusion with <b>Pomarine</b> and Parasitic <b>jaegers.</b> In this article I report details of four records of Long-tailed Jaegers in western Nebraska and comment on the species 2 ̆ 7 identification and status in the state...|$|R
40|$|This rather mild season {{stood out}} for its {{wintering}} waterfowl, most obviously at Keystone L, where Stephen Dinsmore counted an amazing 22 species of waterfowl on 29 January. Check the species {{accounts for the}} incredible wintering numbers; species were topped by Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s first Tufted Duck, and assorted other goodies, such as 5 Barrow 2 ̆ 7 s Goldeneyes, Waterfowl, loons, and grebes also rewrote the midwinter record book, including no fewer than 3 Red-necked Grebes, Some interesting wintering birds also appeared at Harlan Co Res, Other interesting winter records, some no doubt due to the mild fall, included Greater Yellowlegs at two locations, Franklin 2 ̆ 7 s Gull and an adult Black-legged Kittiwake at Harlan Co Res, wintering Hermit Thrush at L Ogallala, a January Gray Catbird in the northwest, a male Dickcissel at Alma, and Orange-erowned and Northern Parula warblers in December, the latter at Keystone L! Sparrows which generally winter only very rarely in NE were well-represented, although poorly-documented, including a Smith 2 ̆ 7 s Longspur in Cass Co, Present in good numbers were Northern Shrike and Purple Finch, the latter welcome after some low years, and Townsend 2 ̆ 7 s Solitaire appeared in low numbers. The Eurasian Collared-Dove continued its expansion in the state, even breeding during the winter period! Westerly reports involved a Red-bellied Woodpecker in Scotts Bluff Co, Carolina Wrens pushing westward, and Winter Wrens wintering in the L McConaughy area, This winter produced some outstanding rarities also, Hiding among the numerous scaup,a Tufted Duck at Keystone L proved a frustrating dip-twitch for many, while a <b>Pomarine</b> <b>Jaeger</b> and Mew Gull were well seen only by one Stephen Dinsmore (who also found, and refound many times for others, the Tufted Duck), Possibly most frustrating was what would likely have been a first state record Slaty-backed Gull at Harlan Co Res, {{which could not be}} refound despite a two-day search, A tantalizing record was of Golden-crowned Sparrows in Cherry Co in early December, the 2 nd winter in a row for this species. A Dark-eyed (Gray-headed) Junco was spotted in Papillion, and a couple of White-winged Crossbills were found...|$|R
40|$|This season, {{partly due}} to the {{departure}} of my co-writer Joel Jorgensen and {{partly due to}} mental aging, I have shortened the species accounts by including only data that add to our current knowledge base. I will not routinely list early and late dates and peak counts for each species unless they are significant; readers should refer to past issues of NBR for guidelines as to what are early or late dates and high counts. Observers are, however, urged to report early and late dates and high counts of all migrant species; {{it is difficult to know}} if a sighting is significant until all the reports are pooled in my computer. In general, most observers thought this a fairly routine fall, although the Panhandle continued to be a source of significant new information, thanks to consistent coverage by Steven Dinsmore. Similar coverage of the Rainwater Basin by Joel Jorgensen also has enhanced our knowledge considerably. Every report is valuable: very few of the large list of observers fail to have at least one of their sightings included in the report. There were no new species added to the state list this fall, but this year was amazing in that respect, with 7 new species (some awaiting approval by the Records Committee) bringing the total state list to a very respectable 441 species. Rarest this fall was the pair of Black-bellied Whistling-Ducks in the Rainwater Basin, a second documented state record. Also very rare were a 7 th state record White-winged Dove and 8 th state record Lesser Goldfinch. Other interesting finds included a Brant of the western race, 3 <b>Pomarine</b> <b>Jaegers,</b> the first documented central Nebraska Blue-headed Vireo, a Mountain Chickadee, a Varied Thrush, another report of Baird 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow, the first Bullock 2 ̆ 7 s Oriole for fall east of the Panhandle, and a White-winged Crossbill. Some rather amazing counts were made: 35, 000 Western Grebes (considered conservative by the experienced observer!), a total of about 300 Great Egrets, 6000 and 4200 Blue-winged Teal, 1492 Ruddy Ducks (no estimating there!), 12, 000 Cliff Swallows, 16 Nelson 2 ̆ 7 s Sharp-tailed Sparrows, and good numbers of Purple Finches for a change. Interesting range expansions were noted for Carolina Wren, Blue-gray Gnatcatcher, and Chipping Sparrow, while the continued presence of Pileated Woodpeckers at Fontenelle Forest adds to the uniqueness of that area in terms of species which breed there and nowhere else that we know about: Red-shouldered Hawk and Yellow-throated Warbler are others.
