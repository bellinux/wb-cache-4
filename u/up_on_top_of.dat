5|$|Early {{shooting}} {{put more}} {{focus on the}} pool playing, but during filming Rossen {{made the decision to}} place more emphasis on the love story between Newman and Laurie's characters. Despite the change in emphasis, Rossen still used the various pool games to show the strengthening of Eddie's character and the evolution of his relationship to Bert and Sarah, through the positioning of the characters in the frame. For example, when Eddie is playing Findley, Eddie is positioned below Bert in a two shot but above Findley while still below Bert in a three shot. When Sarah enters the room, she is below Eddie in two shot while in a three shot Eddie is still below Bert. When Eddie is kneeling over Sarah's body, Bert again appears above him but Eddie attacks Bert, ending <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> him. Eddie finally appears above Bert in two shot when Eddie returns to beat Fats.|$|E
5|$|Founding {{member and}} lead singer Peter Gabriel {{decided to leave}} Genesis in late 1974, midway through the tour for the album The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. The other members hoped he would reconsider, as {{they were still in}} debt and felt his {{departure}} could destroy the band's future, but ultimately accepted that he would leave. The remaining members felt they still wanted to collaborate musically, and show journalists and critics they were primarily a song writing team that could still produce good music. Keyboardist Tony Banks had been close to Gabriel personally, and did not want the band to split <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> seeing less of one of his best friends. He had written a number of songs for a possible solo project before deciding they should be used on the new Genesis album.|$|E
25|$|Both the aluminium-polyethylene {{cladding}} and the PIR insulation plates failed {{fire safety}} tests conducted after the fire, {{according to the}} police. In 2014 safety experts cautioned that the planned insulation was only suitable for use with non-combustible cladding. The Guardian saw a certificate from the building inspectors’ organisation, Local Authority Building Control (LABC), which stated that the chosen insulation for the refit should be used on tall buildings only with fibre cement panels, which do not burn. Combustible panels with polyethylene were put <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> insulation known as Celotex RS5000, made from polyisocyanurate, which burns when heated giving off toxic cyanide fumes.|$|E

25|$|A {{hydraulic}} jump {{is a phenomenon}} in the science of hydraulics which is frequently observed in open channel flow such as rivers and spillways. When liquid at high velocity discharges into a zone of lower velocity, a rather abrupt rise occurs in the liquid surface. The rapidly flowing liquid is abruptly slowed and increases in height, converting some of the flow's initial kinetic energy into an increase in potential energy, with some energy irreversibly lost through turbulence to heat. In an open channel flow, this manifests as the fast flow rapidly slowing and piling <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> itself similar to how a shockwave forms.|$|E
500|$|During the NLCS {{against the}} Giants in Game 2, he slid into second baseman Marco Scutaro during a routine ground ball double play and ended <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> him. [...] Scutaro left {{the game to}} have x-rays taken. [...] Controversy arose and persisted as to whether Holliday {{intentionally}} attempted to injure him. [...] The Giants trailed 1–0 at that point, but scored seven runs to win, 7–1. [...] Eventually, the Giants won the series. [...] The Missouri Athletic Club named Holliday their Sports Personality of the Year for 2012.|$|E

In the text of Luke, there is a full sized miniature of the Temptation of Christ (...) [...] Christ is shown from the waist <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the Temple. To his right is a crowd of people, perhaps representing his disciples. To his left and below him is a black figure of Satan. Above him hover two angels.|$|E

500|$|Usher {{supported}} the album with a two-month concert tour called [...] "The Truth Tour". The tour set featured a small stage <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the main stage, where {{the band played}} with Usher and his supporting dancers left with enough room to perform. The smaller stage had a mini platform attached to it—which lowered to the main stage—and had two big staircases {{on both sides of}} it. To the left, a group of circular staircases climbed to the top, and to the right, there was a fire escape replete with steps and an elevator. Kanye West, who had finished his own headlining tour for his 2004 album The College Dropout, was the opening act for [...] "The Truth Tour".|$|E
500|$|In Tony Johnston's 2005 book, Neighbours: 20 Years of Ramsay Street, Charlene placed {{sixth in}} the twenty classic {{characters}} chapter. Johnston said Charlene and her mother represented [...] "the old and the new", that her career choice was unusual and her [...] "razor-sharp tongue" [...] put the fear into all the men who lusted after her. Johnston added that the younger female viewers admired Charlene, while the boys loved her feisty nature. In her book Soap Opera, Dorothy Hobson believed Charlene broke stereotypes, especially {{when it came to}} careers for women in the 1980s. She wrote, [...] "The sight {{of one of the most}} attractive female characters, dressed in overalls, with her cascading blonde curls tied <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> her head, was one of the most positive images for breaking the stereotypes of what jobs are suitable for girls." [...] Hobson also praised Charlene's on-screen relationship with Scott branding the positive images for young people as [...] "immense". The BBC News noted that Charlene became one of Neighbours most popular characters.|$|E
500|$|The stern section, which {{measures}} about [...] long, was catastrophically damaged during the descent and in {{landing on the}} sea bed. It had not fully filled with water when it sank and the increasing water pressure caused trapped air pockets to implode, tearing apart the hull. It was loud enough that multiple survivors reported hearing explosions about ten seconds after the stern had sank beneath the waves. Data from a sonar map made during a 2010 expedition showed that the stern section rotated like a helicopter blade as it sank. The rudder appears to have swung over to an angle of about 30–45° during the stern's descent, causing the section to follow a tight spiral to the bottom. It probably struck rudder-first, burying most of the rudder in the mud up {{to a depth of}} [...] The decks pancaked {{on top of each other}} and the hull plating splayed out to the sides of the shattered section. The pancaking is so severe that the combined height of the decks, which are piled <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the reciprocating engines, is now generally not more than about [...] high. No individual deck is more than about [...] high.|$|E

500|$|Nala's {{role and}} {{demeanor}} during the film's romantic [...] "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" [...] sequence has drawn criticism {{in regards to}} her [...] "submissive behaviour". The New York Times Janet Maslin cited the film's lack of a strong heroine among its weaknesses, dismissing Nala and Simba's interaction throughout [...] "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" [...] as [...] "obligatory" [...] and [...] "gratuitous". Joel W. Martin wrote in the Journal of Religion and Film, [...] "One song later, [...] have fallen in love. Playing one day, they literally tumble down a hillside in the jungle, and he ends <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> her. This time, she does not bear her teeth, but instead, shows 'bedroom eyes'". Martin ultimately accused the scene's [...] "reversal of positions" [...] of [...] "establish male dominance." [...] Criticizing the film for [...] "being merely distracting when {{it could have been}} both meaningful and instructive", Robert Humanick of Slant Magazine wrote, [...] "Small potatoes, then, when Simba's former childhood friend and betrothed queen Nala ... unexpectedly reappears in his duty-free, protein-rich life, demanding he return to his kingly responsibilities and coaxing the lion to sleep tonight with arguably the most blatant 'fuck me now' face to ever appear in a PG-rated film." ...|$|E

The smaller stage had a mini platform attached to it which lowered to the main stage and had two big staircases {{on both sides of}} it. To the left, a group of circular staircases climbed to the top, and to the right, there was a fire escape replete with steps and an elevator. Kanye West and Christina Milian was the opening act for the tour. Usher at select dates would bring out special guest, during his Atlanta show taping he brought out his artist at the time Rico Love to rap a verse on the song [...] "Throwback". During a more intimate part of the showing Ushers dancers selected singer Monica from the crowd to be serenaded by Usher while he sang album favorites [...] "Do it to Me" [...] and [...] "Superstar". Usher also performed Confessions Pt. II remix where Kanye would appear from back of the stage. Then lastly Usher would also bring out artist Lil Jon and Ludacris where they would finish the show performing the hit [...] "Yeah". This concert date was filmed to make the official tour DVD of Truth Tour: Behind the Truth [...] "Live from Atlanta". It has been certified by the RIAA selling more than 7 Million copies.|$|E
2500|$|Though his {{confrontation}} with Neferhotep {{is perhaps most}} strongly related to Amennakht’s ambitions, there are other instances of violent outbursts. In one instance he told the other chief workman (there are two chief workmen {{at any one time}} [...] ) {{that he was going to}} attack and kill him, though the absence of any further explanation in the papyrus indicates that nothing came of the threat. He is further accused of beating up workmen at a night-party, going <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> a wall, and throwing bricks at people.|$|E

2500|$|Kalomira {{appeared}} {{on stage in}} a short J-Lo dress, accompanied by four male back up dancers, two of which had appeared with Elena Paparizou in Kiev in the Eurovision Song Contest 2005. At {{the start of the}} show, the four dancers hold her <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> themselves, while she is lying down. Later she comes down, and starts dancing with them. Each of the dancers has a letter painted under their undershirts {{and at the end of}} the song, they stand next to each other spelling the word [...] "love". Kalomira won the National Final with 167,000 votes and for the first time in number of years, the media didn't doubt the result of the selection.|$|E
2500|$|Fellow nine-time All-Ireland medallist {{and former}} Kilkenny goalkeeper Noel Skehan said {{of him in}} the {{build-up}} to the 2012 All-Ireland final: [...] "Oh, as it stands, you’re talking about the greatest hurler ever even if he didn’t win on Sunday. He’ll still be the greatest hurler. He’s a fantastic sportsman. What he has achieved up until now, even forgetting the result on Sunday, you’d have to put him well <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the ladder. To do it all on the pitch is a great achievement. To start every championship match since he came on the scene, it goes without saying how good that is and I hope to God that he achieves it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{horizontal}} spacing of digits {{can also}} be proportional, with a character width tightly matching {{the width of the}} figure itself, or tabular, where all digits have the same width. Proportional spacing places the digits closely together, reducing empty space in a document, and is thought to allow the numbers to blend into the text more effectively. As tabular spacing makes all numbers with the same number of digits the same width, it is used for typesetting documents such as price lists, stock listings and sums in mathematics textbooks, all of which require columns of numeric figures to line <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> each other for easier comparison. Tabular spacing is also a common feature of simple printing devices such as cash registers and date-stamps.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was agoin' to git ye a whole stage-load, to stay all night, {{but that}} one'll do ye, I reckon. Ha, ha!" [...] And off he went, {{probably}} fearing that I would throw his passenger <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the stage again.|$|R
60|$|But {{he said he}} {{was afraid}} it was very difficult, because the only way was to get a lock of hair from the head of a king's daughter, to spin it, and to make from it a cloak for the giant, who lived <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> a high mountain.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, the Jacob Lake {{area and the}} rest of the Kaibab was the summer range of the [...] "Bar Z outfit" [...] or the Grand Canyon Cattle company. This brand ran upwards of 100,000 cattle {{throughout}} the Arizona Strip. In the early 1900s [...] "Buffalo Jones" [...] used the Bar Z's corrals at Jacob Lake to pen a herd of buffalo which he then drove onto a ranch in House Rock Valley on the East side of the Kaibab. These same corrals were later home to a [...] "cattalo," [...] a hybrid between one of Jones' buffalos and a domesticated Hereford bull. The remnants of this buffalo herd are still in House Rock and occasionally wander <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the Kaibab to the Grand Canyon.|$|E
2500|$|The next advance was the {{introduction}} of the gas helmet — basically a bag placed over the head. The fabric of the bag was impregnated with a chemical to neutralize the gas — however, the chemical would wash out into the soldier's eyes whenever it rained. Eye-pieces, which were prone to fog up, were initially made from talc. When going into combat, gas helmets were typically worn rolled <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the head, to be pulled down and secured about the neck when the gas alarm was given. The first British version was the Hypo helmet, the fabric of which was soaked in sodium hyposulfite (commonly known as [...] "hypo"). The British P gas helmet, partially effective against phosgene and with which all infantry were equipped with at Loos, was impregnated with sodium phenolate. A mouthpiece was added through which the wearer would breathe out to prevent carbon dioxide build-up. The adjutant of the 1/23rd Battalion, The London Regiment, recalled his experience of the P helmet at Loos: ...|$|E
2500|$|Characteristic of the Unetice {{societies}} {{was greater}} general affluence and developed social stratification, compared with Late Neolithic cultures. Objects made of bronze, often of luxurious or prestigious nature, {{were in high}} demand as symbols of power and importance and are typically found in the graves of [...] "princes". Fourteen such burial sites, circular mounds of earth heaped <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> wooden, clay and stone structures, some as large as 30 meters in diameter, were found in Łęki Małe near Grodzisk Wielkopolski, erected 2000–1800 BC, suggesting {{the existence of a}} local dynasty. Proliferation of locally-made bronze items (Uneticean daggers were in high demand all over Europe and in Anatolia) far from the centers of ore mining or bronze craftsmanship shows that the elites were able to control the trade routes, which involved also the transportation of amber from the Baltic Sea shores to Aegean Sea area artisans. Many concealed (for unknown reasons) bronze treasures have been found, including a fine one from Pilszcz near Głubczyce. Stylistically refined Uneticean ceramics show inspiration from the Achaean vessels obtained through trade. Fortified settlements were built; one actively researched site, that was utilized and went through a number of phases during the 2000–1500 BC period, is in Bruszczewo in Kościan County. Remains of settlements and cemeteries were discovered around Wrocław and elsewhere in Lower Silesia, including an amber processing workshop in Nowa Wieś, Bolesławiec County.|$|E
