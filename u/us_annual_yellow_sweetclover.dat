Overall, pendimethalin (Prowl®) treatments applied preemergence (PREE) provided very good control (> 87 %) of all weeds rated. Metolachlor (Dual®), EPTC plus safener (Eradicane®), dimethanamid (Frontier®), and cyanazine (Bladex®) treatments gave good control (> 80 %) of pigweeds (Amaranthus sp.) and purslane (Portulaca oleraceq) with <b>annual</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>sweetclover</b> (Melilotus ocf`icinalis) not adequately controlled.

5000|$|Some {{cover crops}} {{suppress}} weeds both during growth and after death (Blackshaw et al. 2001). During growth these cover crops compete vigorously with weeds for available space, light, and nutrients, and after death they smother the next flush of weeds by forming a mulch layer {{on the soil}} surface. For example, Blackshaw et al. (2001) found that when using Melilotus officinalis (<b>yellow</b> <b>sweetclover)</b> as a cover crop in an improved fallow system (where a fallow period is intentionally improved by any number of different management practices, including the planting of cover crops), weed biomass only constituted between 1-12% of total standing biomass {{at the end of}} the cover crop growing season. Furthermore, after cover crop termination, the <b>yellow</b> <b>sweetclover</b> residues suppressed weeds to levels 75-97% lower than in fallow (no <b>yellow</b> <b>sweetclover)</b> systems [...]|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} isolate, identify and quantify the predominant allelochemical of <b>yellow</b> <b>sweetclover</b> through organic-solvent extraction, chromatography, thin-layer chromatography (TLC), Gas Chromatography-Mass (GC-MS), and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), {{as well as}} to evaluate its inhibitory effects on weeds through bioassays. The most active allelochemicals of <b>yellow</b> <b>sweetclover</b> were extracted using petroleum ether. A simple coumarin, identified as 2 H- 1 -benzopyran- 2 -one, was isolated and recognized as the most active allelochemical, and the chemical structure of this coumarin was determined (Fig. 4). The coumarin content of original <b>yellow</b> <b>sweetclover</b> extract was 46. 78 μg∙mL- 1, which accounted for 1. 152 % of dry matter of the extract. At 40 μg∙mL- 1, and this coumarin significantly inhibited the seed germination and seedling growth of Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.), common knotgrass (Polygonum aviculare), red clover (Trifolium pratense), veronica (Veronica persica), annual bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album), and plantain (Plantago asiatica) (P < 0. 05). At 80 μg∙mL- 1, except for a slight promotion effect on the seed germination of grainamaranth, coumarin exerted significant inhibition effects on both the seed germination and seedling growth of all tested plants (P < 0. 05). Coumarin also completely inhibited the seed germination and seedling growth of Italian ryegrass, common knotgrass, and red clover.

40|$|Bromoxynil (Buctril®) at 0. 063, 0. 094, and 0. 125 lb AI/A was {{completely}} safe on onions treated {{at the early}} first true leaf stage of growth. Onions did not exhibit visual injury at 12 days after treatment (DAT) and height was not different from the untreated at 45 DAT. Melilotus officinalis (<b>yellow</b> <b>sweetclover)</b> was only marginally controlled by both Buctril and oxyfluorfen (Goal®). Goal provided better weed control with an earlier application timing at 0. 063 lb AI/A than the later application at 0. 25 lb AI/A. All herbicide treated onions yielded higher than the untreated. A rate response was observed for Buctril and Goal where onion yields were higher for the higher rates of application. Results indicate that the POST herbicides at lower than typical use rates were safe when applied to onions at an early timing. Effective weed control of some weeds was observed but <b>yellow</b> <b>sweetclover</b> was not adequately controlled...|$|R
30|$|Seed mixes were {{rudimentary}} {{and much}} less diverse in 1977. The emphasis was on commercially available seed and quick-establishing plants with little understanding or regard to inter- and intraspecific species competition. Ecological diversity, longevity and wildlife habitat value were often secondary considerations. Species such as crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum) and smooth brome (Bromus inermis) (often used for pasture grass) were commonly used in reclamation but are now considered invasive and thus undesirable. Commonly seeded legumes were also agriculturally-based, i.e., alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and <b>yellow</b> <b>sweetclover</b> (Melilotus officinalis).|$|R
40|$|Two {{field studies}} were {{conducted}} to evaluate metolachlor (Dual®) for preemergence weed control in spinach to provide support to gain registration through the IR- 4 program. Dual® at 1. 0 to 1. 5 lb a. i. /A gave acceptable control of London rocket, black mustard, lambsquarters, and knotweed. Nettleleaf goosefoot, cheeseweed, and <b>yellow</b> <b>sweetclover</b> control was not acceptable. In one test, dimethenamid (Frontier® or SAN - 582 H, Sandoz) controlled London rocket, lambsquarters, knotweed, and goosefoot at 0. 25 lb ai. /A and did not control cheeseweed or sweetclover. Spinach was not injured by Dual® or Frontier®...|$|R
40|$|DCPA (Dacthal®) {{herbicide}} {{was applied}} preemergence (PE) {{to the soil}} surface after onion planting and no crop injury was observed for rates of 5. 3, 7. 5, and 10. 5 lb. a. i. /A at one of two locations. Dacthal® gave good control of London rocket and cheeseweed (90 - 94 %) at one location and marginal control at the second location (79 - 85 %). Dacthal® did not exhibit a rate response to control the two weeds common to both locations. The lower rate of Dacthal® {{did not differ in}} efficacy compared to higher rates to completely control lambsquarters and nettleleaf goosefoot.

40|$|Soil-borne fungal {{pathogens}} {{can reduce}} stand density in alfalfa (Medicago sativa), birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus) and <b>yellow</b> <b>sweetclover</b> (Melilotus officinalis) by reducing seedling establishment and subsequent stand longevity. Fungicide seed treatments containing metalaxyl and fludioxonil {{were examined in}} inoculated greenhouse and field tests to determine their efficacy against seedling blight and root rot caused by Fusarium avenaceum and Rhizoctonia solani. Inoculation increased disease severity and reduced establishment, especially in field trials inoculated with Rhizoctonia solani. Under controlled conditions, fludioxonil (alone or in a formulation with metalaxyl) was effective against either pathogen in inoculated trials-seed treatment consistently increased seedling survival and reduced root rot on all three forage species. However, seed treatment had little impact on subsequent forage yield under field conditions. Metalaxyl alone was not efficacious. In fields with high pathogen populations, application of fludioxonil seed treatment on forage legume species could improve seedling establishment substantially...|$|R
40|$|Oxyfluorfen (Goal®) {{herbicide}} at 0. 125 to 0. 25 lb. a. i. /A applied postemergence (POST) to onions at the 3 -leaf {{stage of}} growth effectively controlled London rocket, <b>yellow</b> <b>sweetclover,</b> and prostrate pigweed with marginal injury to onions. Earlier POST applications on 1 - and 2 -leaf onions caused injury and some stand reduction. Bromoxynil (Buctril®) herbicide at 0. 25 lb. a. i. /A applied early POST gave generally good weed control but did not adequately control sweetclover. Buctril® applied in clear weather did not injure 1 -leaf onions but caused severe injury on 2 - and 3 -leaf onions when applied during cloudy weather conditions. Buctril® plus pendimethalin (Prowl®) tank-mix combination applied POST provided good control of London rocket, sweetclover, and prostrate pigweed; however, onion injury was severe due to applying Buctril® in cloudy weather. Buctril® and Goal® effectively controlled weeds present in the onions but timing of POST applications was critical with respect to onion size and weather conditions to minimize injury...|$|R
40|$|Weed control ratings at 3 {{weeks after}} {{treatment}} (WAT) showed that knotweed (Polvgonum argyrocoleon) and <b>yellow</b> <b>sweetclover</b> (Melilotus officinalis) were not controlled by oxyfluorfen (Goal®), pyridate (Lentagran®), clopyralid (Stinger®), sulfentrazone (FMC), or carfentrazone (FMC). Carfentrazone at 0. 50 lb AI/A gave good control (> 89 %) of London rocket (Sisvmbrium irio) and sowthistle (Sonchus oleraceus). A lower rate at 0. 125 lb AI/A provided acceptable control (85 %). Carfentrazone at 0. 50 lb AUA caused severe broccoli and cabbage injury and crop stand reduction. Sulfentrazone at 0. 50 lb AI/A gave nearly acceptable control of knotweed, London rocket, and sowthistle. Cabbage was severely injured and broccoli {{appeared to be}} more tolerant and injury was marginally acceptable (15 %). Stinger and Goal gave nearly acceptable control of sowthistle. Goal at 0. 094 lb AI/A gave 80 % control of London rocket. Goal caused marginally acceptable injury (12 to 17 %) and Stinger caused minimal crop injury. Goal appears to be ineffective against weeds at less than 0. 094 lb AI/A and crop safety is very marginal. Lentagran was relatively safe on broccoli and cabbage but did not control the existing weed spectrum...|$|R
