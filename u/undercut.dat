50|$|<b>Undercuts</b> {{should be}} avoided for ease of manufacturing. <b>Undercuts</b> {{typically}} require additional mechanisms for manufacture adding to mold cost and complexity. In addition, the part must have room to flex and deform. Clever part design or minor design concessions often can eliminate complex mechanisms for <b>undercuts.</b> <b>Undercuts</b> may require additional time for unloading molds. It is recommended that <b>undercuts</b> on a part {{should be avoided}} to the extent possible.|$|R
25|$|<b>Undercuts</b> on molded {{parts are}} {{features}} that prevent the part from being directly ejected from an injection molding machine. They are categorized into {{internal and external}} <b>undercuts,</b> where external <b>undercuts</b> are on {{the exterior of the}} part and interior <b>undercuts</b> are {{on the inside of the}} part. <b>Undercuts</b> can still be molded, but require a side action or side pull. This is an extra part of the mold that moves separately from the two halves. These can increase the cost of the molded part due to an added 15 to 30% cost of the mold itself and added complexity of the molding machine.|$|R
40|$|<b>Undercutting,</b> {{primarily}} considered due to fluvial mechanisms, {{has been}} reported to {{have a major impact on}} slope failure. Predicting bank collapse specifically due to seepage erosion <b>undercutting</b> by particle mobilization on layered streambanks has not been fully studied or modeled, even though its role in streambank erosion may be important. The limitation originates from the limited field measurements or laboratory experiments as well as the unavailability of discrete element models that can effectively simulate seepage particle mobilization, <b>undercutting,</b> and the corresponding mass wasting. The objective of this research was to demonstrate a procedure for incorporating seepage <b>undercutting</b> into bank stability models and to investigate the role of seepage <b>undercutting</b> on bank instability. The question to be addressed is whether seepage particle mobilization can lead to distances of <b>undercutting</b> that are a significant cause of bank instability...|$|R
5|$|Senator Bricker {{introduced}} another proposal {{later in}} the 83rd Congress and proposed similar constitutional amendments in the 84th and 85th Congresses. While hearings were held in the 84th and 85th Congresses, the full Senate took no action {{and the idea of}} amending the Constitution was never again seriously considered. In part, this was because the Supreme Court issued rulings that <b>undercut</b> arguments for it, notably in Reid v. Covert.|$|E
5|$|Before the event, the GFW {{broadcasts}} experienced setbacks. Many {{cable companies}} {{decided not to}} air the event live, opting instead for a replay of UFC 182, and the stream would not run on {{three of the four}} most used devices compatible with Flipps: Chromecast, Xbox 360 and Xbox One. According to Dave Meltzer, NJPW <b>undercut</b> GFW by including the event in the $8.42 monthly price for New Japan Pro Wrestling World; the GFW broadcast of Wrestle Kingdom 9 alone was $34.95. The New Japan Pro Wrestling World stream had Japanese commentary only.|$|E
5|$|Both studios now faced rival projects, {{which could}} <b>undercut</b> their own {{long-term}} financial stability and plans. Columbia had no consistent movie franchise, and had sought Spider-Man since 1989; MGM/UA’s only reliable source of theatrical income {{was a new}} James Bond film {{every two or three}} years. An alternate 007 series could diminish or even eliminate the power of MGM/UA’s long-running Bond series. Likewise, an MGM/UA Spider-Man film could negate Columbia’s plans to create an exclusive cash cow. Both sides seemed to have strong arguments for the rights to do such films.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, {{a simple}} and robust model is {{presented}} to explain the main reason behind <b>undercutting</b> at convex corners and no-undercutting at concave corners. The etch rate of the tangent plane at convex corner {{and the role of}} dangling bond in etching process are utilized to explain the <b>undercutting</b> at convex corner and the no-undercutting at concave corner, respectively. The present model shows that { 110 } is the tangent plane at convex corner which exhibits higher etch rate than the neighboring { 111 } plane in all types of anisotropic etchants; consequently the <b>undercutting</b> occurs at convex corners. The absence of dangling bonds at concave corner prevents the <b>undercutting</b> there. Moreover, the same model explains the reason of very less <b>undercutting</b> when the etching is carried out in surfactant-added tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH).|$|R
30|$|The {{models were}} {{selected}} to be with no <b>undercuts</b> because <b>undercuts</b> need high removal forces, which can confound the results. Therefore, removing them from the study favors {{the reliability of the}} findings [21].|$|R
25|$|<b>Undercuts</b> from etching are {{somewhat}} {{different than the}} <b>undercuts</b> explained above, {{because it is a}} side effect, not an intentional feature. <b>Undercuts</b> from etching can occur from two common causes. The first is over etching, which means the etchant was applied too long. The second is due to an isotropic etchant, which means the etchant etches in all directions equally. To overcome this problem an anisotropic etchant is used.|$|R
5|$|Cyclogenesis {{describes}} {{the process of}} cyclone formation and intensification. Extratropical cyclones begin as waves in large regions of enhanced mid-latitude temperature contrasts called baroclinic zones. These zones contract and form weather fronts as the cyclonic circulation closes and intensifies. Later in their life cycle, extratropical cyclones occlude as cold air masses <b>undercut</b> the warmer air and become cold core systems. A cyclone's track is guided {{over the course of}} its 2 to 6 day life cycle by the steering flow of the subtropical jet stream.|$|E
5|$|Four-time world {{champion}} Vettel however {{was unable to}} overtake the Williams of Valtteri Bottas for fourth. The other Williams of Felipe Massa had applied the <b>undercut</b> well {{in the early part}} of the race to recover from his pit lane-start to eighth position, but when his tyres started to degrade he was passed by both Sergio Pérez and Daniil Kvyat and finished tenth, taking one point. The race ended spectacularly when the Red Bull of Daniel Ricciardo suffered an engine blow-up on the final straight, just being able to coast his car over the finish line.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, {{there were}} nearly 25,000 filling {{stations}} in the UK, of which 10,000 were independents (typically, privately owned and supplied by a major or jobber while using a brand under license).

5|$|Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC is an American music {{publishing}} company owned by Sony through Sony Entertainment. The company was founded as {{a division of}} Associated Television (ATV) in 1955 by Lew Grade. In 1985, Michael Jackson acquired ATV Music Publishing for $47.5million. Paul McCartney, who had told Jackson {{about the importance of}} owning publishing, admitted he felt somewhat <b>undercut</b> by the purchase, because ATV Music Publishing owned the publishing rights to most of The Beatles' songs, although he did not enter the bidding when it came up for sale in 1984.|$|E
5|$|The {{moderate}} Conservatives were Conservatives in name only, and did {{not support}} the saquarema ideology and leadership. During the years following 1857, successive cabinets quickly collapsed, unable to muster a majority in the Chamber of Deputies, as the two Conservative wings <b>undercut</b> each other in a fight for dominance. The Emperor asked Caxias to head a new cabinet on 2 March 1861. Among his ministers were José Maria da Silva Paranhos (later Viscount of Rio Branco), whom Caxias had met and befriended during the Platine War while serving as secretary to Paraná.|$|E
40|$|The <b>undercutting</b> {{process of}} thermal SiO 2 microcantilevers with {{different}} orientations on (100) Si wafer was studied. The silicon substrate was removed by anisotropic chemical etching with a 25 wt. % aqueous solution of TMAH or a 30 wt. % aqueous KOH solution at 80 °C. It {{was found that}} oriented cantilevers were <b>undercutting</b> frontally along the length and oriented cantilevers experience <b>undercutting</b> along {{the width of the}} cantilever, which is a less time consuming process.

30|$|A simple {{model is}} {{proposed}} {{to explain the}} etching characteristics of convex and concave corners on Si{ 110 } surface in wet anisotropic etchants. The proposed model explains the basic reasons behind the corner <b>undercutting</b> in a very simple and robust way. Moreover, it explains the dramatic reduction in the <b>undercutting</b> in surfactant-added TMAH solution. In {{the case of the}} surfactant-added TMAH, crystallographic orientation dependent adsorption of the surfactant molecules (owing to varying hydrophobicity of the crystallographic planes) is employed to describe the significant reduction in the <b>undercutting</b> at convex corners. In order to explain the reason of no-undercutting at concave corners, the role of dangling bonds in etching mechanism is exploited. The <b>undercutting</b> at convex corners is explained using the etch rate behavior of tangent plane appearing at this type of corners.|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} cast {{was listed}} in {{the first edition of}} The Country Wife, as was standard practice, and modern scholars have suggested that this information throws light on Wycherley's intentions. Wycherley wrote with the original actors in mind, tailoring the roles to their strengths. Also, since the audience consisted mostly of habitual playgoers, authors and directors could use the associations of an actor's previous repertoire to enrich or <b>undercut</b> a character, effects familiar on television and in the cinema today.|$|E
5|$|When {{radially}} broaching workpieces {{that require}} a deep cut per tooth, such as forgings or castings, a rotor-cut or jump-cut design can be used; these broaches are also known as free egress or nibbling broaches. In this design the RPT is designated {{to two or three}} rows of teeth. For the broach to work the first tooth of that cluster has a wide notch, or <b>undercut,</b> and then the next tooth has a smaller notch (in a three tooth design) and the final tooth has no notch. This allows for a deep cut while keeping stresses, forces, and power requirements low.|$|E
5|$|According to Domhoff, {{many people}} {{seem to believe that}} the United States is ruled from behind the scenes by a conspiratorial elite with secret desires, i.e., by a small secretive group that wants to change the {{government}} system or put the country under the control of a world government. In the past the conspirators were usually said to be crypto-communists who were intent upon bringing the United States under a common world government with the Soviet Union, but the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 <b>undercut</b> that theory. Domhoff notes that most conspiracy theorists changed their focus to the United Nations as the likely controlling force in a New World Order, an idea which is undermined by the powerlessness of the U.N. and the unwillingness of even moderates within the American Establishment to give it anything but a limited role.|$|E

30|$|The <b>undercutting</b> and underetching are {{the lateral}} etching which occur under the masking layer. Mostly, the words “undercutting” and “underetching” are used interchangeably. In {{reference}} [1], underetching is specifically {{used to define}} the etching under the mask edges which do not contain extruded/convex corners. This kinds of underetching takes place due to the misalignment of mask edges or/and owing to finite etching of the { 111 } planes. If the mask patterns include convex corners, the underetching at convex corners is termed as <b>undercutting.</b> Hereafter, mainly <b>undercutting</b> word {{is used for the}} lateral etching at any type of mask edge and corner. In the case of { 100 } wafers, significant <b>undercutting</b> takes place at the edges aligned along non-< 110 > directions if an etchant is used without any additives (i.e. pure KOH or TMAH). In order to fabricate the square/rectangle cavity of controlled dimensions in { 100 } silicon wafers, the sides of square/rectangle mask opening are aligned along the < 110 > directions as the mask edges aligned with these directions exhibit minimum <b>undercutting</b> owing to the appearance of { 111 } planes. If the sides are slightly misaligned from the < 110 >direction, the <b>undercutting</b> starts at the edges resulting in a cavity of bigger dimensions than the requirement as shown in Figure  3.|$|R

This opened up the opportunity for the second Ferrari of Kimi Räikkönen {{to go around the}} outside of the Mercedes and take third. Hamilton tried to open up a gap in order to cover his position, should the Ferrari drivers attempt a so-called <b>undercut,</b> a strategy in which a car entered the pit lane early in order to use fresher tyres to get in front of another car without overtaking them on track. Meanwhile, Rosberg took back third from Räikkönen on lap four before doing the same with Vettel on the end of lap nine.|$|E
5|$|Like other otters, the North American {{river otter}} {{lives in a}} holt, or den, {{constructed}} in the burrows of other animals, or in natural hollows, such as under a log or in river banks. An entrance, which may be under water or above ground, leads to a nest chamber lined with leaves, grass, moss, bark, and hair. Den sites include burrows dug by woodchucks (Marmota monax), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), nutria (Myocastor coypus), or beaver and muskrat lodges. River otters also may use hollow trees or logs, <b>undercut</b> banks, rock formations, backwater sloughs, and flood debris. The use of den and resting sites is chiefly opportunistic, although locations that provide protection and seclusion are preferred.|$|E

Dwight brings Charles to the parking lot during one of the secret meetings, where Charles orders Michael to stop pestering Dwight. This begins a rivalry between Michael and Dwight, and Michael begins to steal Dwight's clients. Dwight asks for a truce and offers to take Michael and his employees out to lunch; Dwight does not go to the restaurant and instead sneaks into the empty Michael Scott Paper Company office and steals everything on Michael's desk, including his Rolodex contact list, and places a dead fish in the air conditioning vent.|$|E

40|$|Dynamic {{change at}} the marine-terminating margins of the Greenland Ice Sheet may be {{initiated}} by the ocean, particularly where subglacial runoff drives vigorous ice-marginal plumes and rapid submarine melting. Here we model submarine melt-driven <b>undercutting</b> of tidewater glacier termini, simulating a process which is key to understanding ice-ocean coupling. Where runoff emerges from broad subglacial channels we find that <b>undercutting</b> has only a weak impact on local submarine melt rate but increases total ablation by submarine melting due to the larger submerged ice surface area. Thus, the impact of melting is determined {{not only by the}} melt rate magnitude but also by the slope of the ice-ocean interface. We suggest that the most severe <b>undercutting</b> occurs at the maximum height in the fjord reached by the plume, likely promoting calving of ice above. It remains unclear, however, whether <b>undercutting</b> proceeds sufficiently rapidly to influence calving at Greenland's fastest-flowing glaciers...|$|R
