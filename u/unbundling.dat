40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we {{estimate}} demand curves for <b>unbundled</b> loops sold by incumbent local exchange telecommunications carriers to their retail rivals. Of primary interest are the cross-price effects between <b>unbundled</b> loops purchased {{with and without}} <b>unbundled</b> switching. As expected, we find downward-sloping demand curves for <b>unbundled</b> elements, with own-price elasticities in the elastic region of demand. Interestingly, however, we also find no evidence of positive cross-price elasticities between alternative modes of <b>unbundled</b> element entry...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The Telecommunications Act of 1996 {{requires}} incumbent monopoly {{phone companies}} to lease elements of their networks to rivals. An important policy {{question is whether}} these <b>unbundled</b> elements are substitutes for entry modes that are more facilities‐based. In this article, we estimate demand curves for <b>unbundled</b> elements {{with the goal of}} assessing cross‐price effects between two of the more popular entry modes that differ in the mix of <b>unbundled</b> and self‐supplied inputs. As expected, we find downward sloping demand curves for <b>unbundled</b> elements. We also find own‐price elasticities in the elastic region of demand. What we do not find is evidence of substitution; we are able to reject the hypothesis of effective substitution between the two entry modes.

2500|$|In a {{decision}} by the Government on 3 May 2006, Telecom was forced to unbundle the local loop, to provide [...] "access to fast, competitively priced broadband internet". The decision significantly affected the company's market share, and allowed competitors (such as TelstraClear, Orcon and Ihug) to offer broadband and other communications services throughout New Zealand by installing their own equipment in exchanges. The announcement of this decision was rushed ahead of schedule, as the documents were leaked to Telecom who advised the government of the leak. It was widely reported that the government had intended to make the announcement during the 2006 Budget. Most of Telecom's competitors and many independent commentators such as InternetNZ and Paul Budde applauded the decision, with opposition to <b>unbundling</b> coming from the Business Roundtable, Federated Farmers, and Bruce Sheppard (representing Telecom shareholders). Legislation was introduced to enable the regulatory changes. Three other political parties (New Zealand First, the Green Party and United Future) supported the decision, which would give the government at least 66 votes if there were no votes against the party line. The main opposition National Party initially opposed the <b>unbundling</b> decision, but later voted in favour of it after a select committee hearing. This left the ACT Party alone in opposing the decision.|$|E
