40|$|There is an {{increasing}} need for a “one plan approach” for conservation strategies that integrate in-situ and ex-situ management processes. Zoological institutions contribute directly to threatened species conservation through paradigms, such as reintroduction, head-starting, supplementation, or rescue/rehabilitation/release. This in-situ/ex-situ integration necessitates collaboration {{at all levels of}} conservation action including planning, implementation, monitoring and assessment to drive adaptive management processes. Each component is dependent on the availability and accuracy of data for evidence to facilitate evaluation and adaptive management processes. The Zoological Information Management System (ZIMS), managed by Species 360, is a centralized web-based information system used in zoological institutions worldwide to pool life history, behavior and health data and facilitate animal husbandry, health, and breeding management processes. Currently <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>few</b> integrated conservation programs, ZIMS is an innovative tool that offers a new opportunity to link data management processes for animals that spend a part of their lives under human care and part in their natural environment and has great potential for use in managed wild populations...|$|E
40|$|Test data {{compression}} {{is the major}} issues for the external testing of IP core-based SoC. From a large pool of diverse available techniques for compression, run length-based schemes are most appropriate for IP cores. To improve the compression and to reduce the test power, the test data processing schemes like “don't care bit filling” and “reordering” which do not require any modification in internal structure and do not demand use of any test development tool {{can be used for}} SoC-containing IP cores with hidden structure. The proposed “Weighted Transition Based Reordering-Columnwise Bit Filling-Difference Vector (WTR-CBF-DV) ” is a modification to earlier proposed “Hamming Distance based Reordering—Columnwise Bit Filling and Difference vector. ” This new method aims not only at very high compression but also aims at shift in test power reduction without any significant on-chip area overhead. The experiment results on ISCAS 89 benchmark circuits show that the test {{data compression}} ratio has significantly improved for each case. It is also noteworthy that, in most of the case, this scheme does not involve any extra silicon area overhead compared to the base code with which it <b>used.</b> <b>For</b> <b>few</b> cases, it requires an extra XOR gate and feedback path only. As application of this scheme increases run length of zeroes in test set, as a result, the number of transitions during scan shifting is reduced. This may lower scan power. The proposed scheme can be easily integrated into the existing industrial flow...|$|E

40|$|Ximenia {{americana}} {{is used in}} African ethno-medicine for spasmodic bowel diseases with stem bark particularly {{used for}} ulcers. This study evaluated the toxicity-profile of methanol stem-bark extract. Extract doses were selected from estimated oral median lethal dose (LD 50) of acute toxicity test. Ten male Wistar rats in 4 -groups, weekly weighed and daily treated orally per body-weight for 28 Â days with normal-saline and extract-doses (250, 500, 1000 Â mg/kg) respectively were euthanized. Blood for biochemical and haematological analyses were collected into plain and anticoagulated (EDTA) sample-bottles respectively from each group. Vital-organs were isolated, weighed and fixed in buffered-formalin fixatives for histo-analyses. MeanÂ Â±Â standard-error of mean and statistical-significance at (pÂ â¤Â  0. 05) of obtained-data were evaluated. The extract at up to 5000 Â mg/kg caused no mortality or behavioural toxic-signs and thus, oral LD 50 {{was estimated to be}} greater than 5000 Â mg/kg. No changes in organ-sizes, body-weights or anatomy of brain, heart, liver and stomach occurred, but at 1000 Â mg/kg, kidney showed vascular-congestion with polymorphonuclear cells, lungs had consolidated areas of polymorphs infiltration, while spleen had distorted germinal-centres. Liver enzymes and urea levels were not altered significantly, but a dose dependent significant increase in total-protein only at 1000 Â mg/kg; and significant reduction in albumin level at 500 and 1000 Â mg/kg were observed. The observed dose-dependent reduction in creatinine was not significant. Total-calcium and chloride ion concentrations increased significantly only at 250 Â mg/kg. In conclusion, acute oral administration of methanol stem-bark extract of Ximenia americana was relatively non-toxic in mice, but minimal anatomical changes in kidney, lungs and spleen occurred when <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>few</b> weeks in rats.

40|$|This paper studies two-class (or binary) {{classification}} of elements X in Rk {{that allows for}} a reject option. Based on n independent copies of the pair of random variables (X, Y) with X ∈ Rk and Y ∈ { 0, 1 }, we consider classifiers f(X) that render three possible outputs: 0, 1 and R. The option R expresses doubt and is to be <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>few</b> observations {{that are hard to}} classify in an automatic way. Chow (1970) derived the optimal rule minimizing the risk P{f(X) = Y, f(X) = R} + dP{f(X) = R}. This risk function subsumes that the cost of making a wrong decision equals 1 and that of utilizing the reject option is d. We show that the classification problem hinges on the behavior of the regression function η(x) = E(Y |X = x) near d and 1 − d. (Here d ∈ [0, 1 / 2] as the other cases turn out to be trivial.) Classification rules can be categorized into plug-in estimators and empirical risk minimizers. Both types are considered here and we prove that the rates of convergence of the risk of any estimate depends on P{|η(X) − d | ≤ δ} + P{|η(X) − (1 − d) | ≤ δ} and {{on the quality of the}} estimate for η or an appropriate measure of the size of the class of classifiers, in case of plug-in rules and empirical risk minimizers, respectively. We extend the mathematical framework even further by differentiating between costs associated with the two possible errors: predicting f(X) = 0 whilst Y = 1 and predicting f(X) = 1 whilst Y = 0. Such situations are common in, for instance, medical studies where misclassifying a sick patient as healthy is worse than the opposite. Running title: Classification with reject optio...|$|E
