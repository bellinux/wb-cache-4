40|$|Abstract—In {{this work}} 1, we {{consider}} a setting where K Transmitters (TXs) equipped with multiple antennas aim at transmitting to their K respective Receivers (RXs) also equipped with multiple antennas. Without exchange of the <b>user’s</b> <b>data</b> symbols, {{this represents a}} conventional Interference Channel (IC), while it is a so-called MIMO Network Channel if the <b>user’s</b> <b>data</b> symbols are fully shared between all the TXs. The focus of this work is on the intermediate case where the <b>user’s</b> <b>data</b> symbols can be arbitrary shared to the TXs such that only {{a subset of the}} TXs has access to the data symbols to transmit to a given RX. We show that we can build a virtual IC so as so have the transmission in that IC equivalent to the transmission in the original setting. In this virtual IC, it is then possible to apply any of the numerous algorithms (Interference Alignment algorithms) initially tailored for the IC. Finally, we let the routing matrix be optimized subject to a constraint on the total number of symbols shared and use a greedy algorithm to find the <b>user’s</b> <b>data</b> allocation. We show by simulations that sharing only few <b>user’s</b> <b>data</b> symbols is sufficient to achieve most of the performance. I...|$|R
5|$|The ATA Secure Erase {{command is}} {{designed}} to remove all <b>user</b> <b>data</b> from a drive.

This will initially restore its performance to the highest possible level and the best (lowest number) possible write amplification, {{but as soon as}} the drive starts garbage collecting again the performance and write amplification will start returning to the former levels. Many tools use the ATA Secure Erase command to reset the drive and provide a user interface as well. One free tool that is commonly referenced in the industry is called HDDErase. Gparted and Ubuntu live CDs provide a bootable Linux system of disk utilities including secure erase.|$|E
5|$|This iPad uses an {{internal}} rechargeable lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) battery that {{can hold a}} charge of 11,560mAh. The batteries are made in Taiwan by Simplo Technology (60%) and Dynapack International Technology (40%). The iPad {{is designed to be}} charged with a relatively high current of 2amps using the included 12W USB power adapter and Lightning connector. While it can be charged by an older USB port from a computer, these are limited to 500milliamps (0.5amps). As a result, if the iPad is in use while powered by a computer, it may charge very slowly, or not at all. High-power USB ports found in newer computers and accessories provide full charging capabilities. Apple claims that the battery can provide up to 10hours of video, audio playback, or web surfing on Wi-Fi, 9hours of web surfing over a cellular connection, or one month on standby. Like any rechargeable battery, the iPad's battery loses capacity over time. However, the iPad's battery is not user-replaceable.

OpenNebula interoperability makes cloud an evolution by leveraging existing IT infrastructure. Cloud computing enables highly scalable services to be easily consumed over the internet on an as-needed basis.
