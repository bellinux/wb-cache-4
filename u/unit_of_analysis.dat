25|$|For example, while formal {{linguistics}} {{takes the}} sentence {{to be the}} canonical <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis,</b> conversation analysis (CA) takes the turn at talk as canonical. Speakers in conversation often do not use complete sentences or even complete words to converse. Rather, discourse is composed of sequences of turns which are composed of Turn construction unit (e.g. a word, phrase, clause, sentence). In CA, the form and meaning of an utterance {{is a product of}} situated activity- which is to say meaning is highly contextual (within a social, interactive context) and contingent upon how participants respond to each other regardless of grammatical completeness of an utterance.|$|E

Taking various communities—including online communities—as the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis,</b> community sociologists study the origin and effects of different associations of people. For instance, German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies distinguished between two types of human association: Gemeinschaft (usually translated as [...] "community") and Gesellschaft ("society" [...] or [...] "association"). In his 1887 work, Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft, Tönnies argued that Gemeinschaft {{is perceived to be}} a tighter and more cohesive social entity, due to the presence of a [...] "unity of will". The 'development' or 'health' of a community is also a central concern of community sociologists also engage in development sociology, exemplified by the literature surrounding the concept of social capital.|$|E

2500|$|In {{historical}} ecology, {{the landscape}} is defined as an area of interaction between human culture and the non-human environment. [...] The landscape is a perpetually changing, physical manifestation of history. Historical ecology revises {{the notion of the}} ecosystem and replaces it with the landscape. While an ecosystem is static and cyclic, a landscape is historical. While the ecosystem concept views the environment as always trying to return to a state of equilibrium, the landscape concept considers [...] "landscape transformation" [...] to be a process of evolution. Landscapes do not return to a state of equilibrium, but are palimpsests of successive disturbances over time. The use of [...] "landscape" [...] instead of [...] "ecosystem" [...] as the core <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> {{lies at the heart of}} historical ecology.|$|E
2500|$|Under Magdoff's direction, the Monthly Review {{focused more}} and more upon imperialism as the key <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> for global {{development}} and the forces challenging neocolonialism in the Third World. [...] This perspective put the magazine and its press squarely on the New Left intellectual agenda since the late 1960s. [...] His work also kept him {{in the forefront of}} socialist thought in the U.S. from the 1930s to this day. [...] The Great Depression left a strong impact on Magdoff's perspective on capitalism, as Magdoff recalls a sense of doom felt in the mid-century by pro-capitalists, holding that nothing since 1929 led him to believe that the economy has become immune to cycles of severe crisis. Until his death, Magdoff co-edited the Monthly Review with John Bellamy Foster.|$|E

Content analysis is an approach to the <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> documents and texts that seeks to quantify the contents in terms of predetermined categories and in a systematic and replicable manner (Bryman 2012). The content analysis in this study followed this pattern: (i) appropriate texts for analysis were chosen (ii) the texts were spilt into smaller <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> (iii) relevant categories <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> were developed (iv) coding <b>of</b> the <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> was done (v) <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the text in terms <b>of</b> the <b>units</b> and their relationship with other units that occurs in the text was done (Denscombe 2013).|$|R

5000|$|Inspired by Trubetzkoy, [...] {{proposed}} {{a synthesis of}} linguistic geography and descriptive linguistics by applying the structuralist concept of grammar to the description of regular correspondences between different varieties; a resulting supergrammar, which he called a diasystem, {{would be consistent with}} the individual grammars of all the member dialects. A diasystem is a higher order system and its component <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> would accordingly be abstractions of a higher order than the <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the individual systems. That is, just as the phones present within an individual variety are grouped together into abstract phonemes, the phonemes present within a group of varieties could be grouped together into even more abstract diaphonemes. Weinreich exemplified the diasystemic approach by a formulaic arrangement of phoneme correspondences in three dialects of Yiddish, focusing on the vowels but arguing that the principle could work for other aspects of language.|$|R
