25|$|The Metaverse, {{a phrase}} coined by Stephenson as a {{successor}} to the Internet, constitutes Stephenson's vision of how a virtual reality-based Internet might evolve in the near future. Resembling a massively multiplayer online game (MMO), the Metaverse is populated by <b>user-controlled</b> avatars as well as system daemons. Although there are public-access Metaverse terminals in Reality, using them carries a social stigma among Metaverse denizens, {{in part because of}} the poor visual representations of themselves as low-quality avatars. Status in the Metaverse is a function of two things: access to restricted environments such as the Black Sun, an exclusive Metaverse club, and technical acumen, which is often demonstrated by the sophistication of one's avatar.|$|E
500|$|Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence was {{released}} in Japan on December 22, 2005, later in North America on March 14, 2006, in Europe on October 6, 2006 and in Australia on October 13, 2006. Subsistence continues the Metal Gear Solid series tradition of follow-up expanded versions. While previous releases, such as [...] and [...] included skill challenge missions and/or side story missions, Subsistence eschews the extra single-player missions to include updated versions of the series' first two games, Metal Gear and , a brand-new competitive online mode, and a fully 3D, <b>user-controlled</b> camera in the main portion of the game. Because of all the additional content that was added, the Subsistence edition was split into two discs: the first disc contains the main game only (including the cutscenes viewer), while the second disc features the online multiplayer mode {{and all the other}} supplemental content.|$|E
500|$|From the start, Uprising {{was meant}} to be {{distinct}} from the original Kid Icarus: while Kid Icarus was a platformer featuring horizontal and vertical movement from a side-scrolling perspective, Uprising shifted to being a fully 3D third-person shooter broken between airborne and ground-based segments in each chapter. Much of the game's depth and scale came from Sakurai's own game design philosophy, along with the inclusion of various weapon types that opened up different strategic options. The number of weapons available in-game was decided from an early stage, as Sakurai wanted solid goals for the development team so development would go smoothly. The original Kid Icarus was notorious for its high difficulty, but this was an aspect Sakurai wanted to tone down so that casual gamers could enjoy Uprising. For this reason, the Fiend's Cauldron was created as a <b>user-controlled</b> means of both setting difficulty and allowing players to challenge themselves by placing bets against their performances. The Fiend's Cauldron tied into the game's overall theme of [...] "challenge". The game's difficulty was one of the three key elements decided upon by Sakurai, alongside the music and light-hearted storyline. The addition of the AR Card game was based on Sakurai's wish to fully utilize the 3DS' planned features, and was inspired by the trophy viewing option from Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Due to the volume of cards produced, the team needed to create a special system based on a colorbit, an ID recognition code along the bottom edge of a card. After consideration, it was decided to have the [...] "Idol" [...] displays able to fight each other, with battles revolving around a stat-based rock-paper-scissors mechanic. It also provided a means for players to measure the strength of characters without directly connecting their consoles.|$|E

2500|$|In some cases, {{manufacturers}} are producing HEVs {{that use the}} added energy provided by the hybrid systems to give vehicles a power boost, rather than significantly improved fuel efficiency compared to their traditional counterparts. The trade-off between added performance and improved fuel efficiency is partly controlled by the software within the hybrid system and partly {{the result of the}} engine, battery and motor size. In the future, manufacturers may provide HEV owners with the ability to partially control this balance (fuel efficiency vs. added performance) as they wish, through a <b>user-controlled</b> setting. Toyota announced in January, 2006 that it was considering a [...] "high-efficiency" [...] button.|$|E
2500|$|MyLeague mode is {{touted as}} a [...] "sandbox" [...] version of MyGM and is more similar to {{previous}} games' Association mode. MyLeague features most features in MyGM in that the player controls an NBA organization, customizing basketball aspects, and making money. However, MyLeague features more online multiplayer components, whereas MyGM is single-player only, and has similar customization options to MyTeam. MyLeague features more customization options than MyGM and removes certain 'rules' to allow flexibility for the player. For example, the player can freely relocate their team, trade players, change team aesthetics, and purchase upgrades without restrictions. The player may enter a MyLeague association made up of 30 <b>user-controlled</b> teams, instead of one user- and 29 CPU-controlled teams.|$|E

Also, a <b>user-controlled</b> starting pitcher's schedule will be simulated for all games in which the user does not pitch.|$|E
50|$|Inexpensive corner-aiming retroreflectors {{are used}} in <b>user-controlled</b> {{technology}} as optical datalink devices. Aiming is done at night, and the necessary retroreflector area depends on aiming distance and ambient lighting from street lamps. The optical receiver itself behaves as a weak retroreflector because it contains a large, precisely focused lens that detects illuminated objects in its focal plane. This allows aiming without a retroreflector for short ranges.|$|E
