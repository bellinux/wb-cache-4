He criticised the interface, writing [...] "not every icon is self-explanatory, and it takes time <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> at home," [...] and the {{occasional}} difficulty in locating where in the production chain {{there may be a}} problem. However, he praised the graphics, character animations, level design and the tactical aspects of combat, concluding [...] "The Settlers 3 is the best game in the Settlers series, and the new benchmark in the city-building genre." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the five}} songs she had written by for her seventh studio album, Clarkson co-wrote [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] with {{frequent}} collaborator Greg Kurstin, who produced the track. Clarkson has said about writing the song: A lot {{of the reasons why}} I wrote [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] was I guess I didn't realize the gravity of the situation until I had a child of my own, and until I experienced love like I do with Brandon (Blackstock) on the daily basis. I guess you don't realize something is missing <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> it. I can't imagine walking away from my little girl. I can't imagine not having that love anymore. I didn't know it was missing because I never had it. It was a revelation and that's why I wrote that song. I {{think a lot of people}} go through that.|$|E
2500|$|Critical {{response}} to the album has been mixed, based on a score of 59 out of 100 from review aggregator site Metacritic. The Observers review of Echo gave the album three out of five stars, with reviewer Peter Robinson writing, [...] "Unusually for an X Factor graduate, there was actually something at risk if the second album didn't work, but Echo hits its target. A handful of upbeat numbers – including an unexpected foray into frothy high-speed electro – pull Leona {{back from the brink}} of boring." [...] Jim Farber of the New York Daily News agreed, writing [...] "Echo has a sense of fun, and a youthful vim, rarely on display on Spirit. It's faster, harder and way catchier." [...] Neil McCormick, writing in The Daily Telegraph, said Lewis's [...] "mezzo-soprano range allows her to take melodies from luxurious low notes to high-flying falsetto, gliding with elegant power and impressive control through all kinds of fluctuations and modulations. [...] The approach of the album's producers is to throw Leona at a song, with multi-tracked vocals shooting off in every direction, <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> like you're listening to a room full of cloned divas fighting over who gets the top line. It's an exhausting yet strangely exhilarating experience." [...] Heats Karen Edwards awarded the album five stars out of five, saying [...] "From girlie pop to big ballads, this album will remind you what the fuss is all about. Future X Factor winners take note: this is what real talent sounds like." ...|$|E

60|$|One {{needs to}} save up {{beforehand}} if one desires to spend {{any length of}} time in Holland. One talks of dear old England, but the dearest land in all the world is little Holland.

It is not <b>until</b> <b>you</b> have forgotten the taste of it that <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>you</b> ever want to smoke again. I knew a man who reckoned that he had saved hundreds of pounds by smoking Dutch cigars for a month steadily. It was years before he again ventured on tobacco.|$|R

6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what must seem strange, that when it's over <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> so {{extraordinarily}} pure. <b>You</b> <b>feel</b> like a disembodied spirit, immaterial; and {{you seem to be}} able to touch beauty as though it were a palpable thing; and <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> an intimate communion with the breeze, and with the trees breaking into leaf, and with the iridescence of the river. <b>You</b> <b>feel</b> like God.

6000|$|... "While you undress and {{get into}} bed I will get a blanket ready. It is to be dipped in boiling water, and then wrung out until it is as dry as we can get it.

6000|$|To {{enjoy your}} holiday in bed to the full, you should {{let it be}} vaguely {{understood}} {{that there is something}} amiss with you. Don't go into details, for they are not necessary; and, besides, you want to be dreamy more or less, and the dreamy state is not consistent with a definite ailment. The moment one takes to bed he gets sympathy. He may be suffering from a tearing headache or a tooth that makes him cry out; but if he goes about his business, or even flops in a chair, true sympathy is denied him. Let him take to bed with one of those illnesses of which he can say with accuracy that he is not quite certain what is the matter with him, and his wife, for instance, will want to bathe his brow. She must not be made too anxious. That would not only be cruel to her, but it would wake you from the dreamy state. She must simply see that you are [...] "not yourself." [...] Women have an idea that unless men are [...] "not themselves" [...] they will not take to bed, and as a consequence your wife is tenderly thoughtful of you. Every little while she will ask you if you are feeling any better now, and you can reply, with the old regard for truth, that you are [...] "much about it." [...] You may even (for your own pleasure) talk of getting up now, when she will earnestly urge you to stay in bed <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> easier. You consent; indeed, you are ready to do anything to please her.|$|E
60|$|At {{the end of}} an hour I {{found myself}} {{wandering}} through the apartments of the great palace. They follow each other in infinite succession, with no great variety of interest or aspect, but with persistent pomp and a fine specific effect. They are exactly of their various times. You pass from painted and panelled bedchambers and closets, anterooms, drawing-rooms, council-rooms, through king's suite, queen's suite, prince's suite, <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> yourself move through the appointed hours and stages of some rigid monarchical day. On one side are the old monumental upholsteries, the big cold tarnished beds and canopies, with the circumference of disapparelled royalty symbolised by a gilded balustrade, and the great carved and yawning chimney-places where dukes-in-waiting may have warmed their weary heels; on the other, in deep recesses, rise the immense windows, the framed and draped embrasures where the sovereign whispered and favourites smiled, looking out on terraced gardens and misty park. The brown walls are dimly illumined by innumerable portraits of courtiers and captains, more especially with various members of the Batavian entourage of William of Orange, the restorer of the palace; with good store too of the lily-bosomed models of Lely and Kneller. The whole tone of this processional interior is singularly stale and sad. The tints of all things have both faded and darkened--you taste the chill of the place as you walk from room to room. It was still early in the day and in the season, and I flattered myself that I was the only visitor. This complacency, however, dropped at sight of a person standing motionless before a simpering countess of Sir Peter Lely's creation. On hearing my footstep this victim of an evaporated spell turned his head and I recognised my fellow lodger of the Red Lion. I was apparently recognised as well; {{he looked as if he}} could scarce wait for me to be kind to him, and in fact didn't wait. Seeing I had a catalogue he asked the name of the portrait. On my satisfying him he appealed, rather timidly, as to my opinion of the lady.|$|E

500|$|Another {{recurrent}} {{theme in}} the album is that everything is broken, out of place or missing; This is apparent in nearly all songs in the album. Examples include [...] "Fix You" [...] ("When you lose something you can't replace") and also in [...] "X" [...] ("When something is broken, {{and you try to}} fix it, trying to repair it, any way you can") and [...] "Talk" [...] ("Are you lost or incomplete? Do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?"). This theme is also reflective of the random, incomprehensible pattern on the album's cover (<b>until</b> <b>you</b> [...] "fix" [...] it using the Baudot Code).|$|R

5000|$|Beginning {{with work}} from the early 1980s, Pondick has worked with {{fragments}} that invoke the body, including shoes, baby bottles, and teeth, “a quirky vocabulary of anatomical parts and body related objects that had some of Louise Bourgeois' oddity and near-surrealism and Philip Guston’s poignant, ambiguous symbolism.” These early provocative works have included scatological references in bodily assemblages. Her early work has been interpreted by critics in numerous ways, as a feminist critique of Freudian theories of sexuality, {{as an expression of}} infantile and juvenile desires, and as “Freudian vaudeville acts designed to make you laugh <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> something caught in your throat.” ...|$|E
