40|$|Joint tenancy and tenancy {{in common}} are {{for all intents and}} {{purposes}} the only means of co-ownership of real or personal property in Western Australia. Joint tenants hold the whole property jointly and nothing separately. Tenants in common, on the other hand, have a distinct share in the property. There are two essential features that distinguish a joint tenancy from a {{tenancy in common}}. The first feature is the right of survivorship: upon the death of one joint tenant his interest in the property is extinguished and the interest of the surviving joint tenants is correspondingly enlarged. Upon the death of a tenant in common his interest in the property passes under his will or intestacy. The second feature is the presence of four unities: in order for there to be a joint tenancy there must be <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>title,</b> interest, time and possession. Although the four unities may be present in a tenancy in common, the only unity which is essential is unity of possession...|$|E

Regrettably, a unified response was missing among Title 10 Active Duty and Title 32 National Guard members following Hurricane Katrina. Since then, initiatives based in doctrine, statutes and formal recommendations have been established to address <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> effort, however, a serious knowledge gap remains. Future threats, manmade or natural, will require a unified response to save lives and mitigate suffering. Case studies on the Israeli Home Front Command and the Florida Division of Emergency Management help determine best practices to reach <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> effort between <b>Title</b> 10 Active Duty and Title 32 National Guard. Appreciating the varying perspectives, concerns and competing interests among state and federal stakeholders on command and control of military forces in the homeland is vital to moving forward.

40|$|The title, as {{a proper}} name, {{guarantees}} the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> the oeuvre. <b>Titles</b> {{have the capacity}} to hold together, sum up, stand for and register an oeuvre as oeuvre, countering the threat of disorganisation, endlessness and dispersion. Different authors have interrogated the powers of the proper name and created new economies between title and work that question their presumed equivalence and unification. T. W. Adorno pursues in various texts a crusade against the conformist and exploitative <b>titles</b> <b>of</b> the culture industry[1]. Against titles-for-profit, he favoured titles «so close to the work that they respect its hiddenness», titles «into which ideas immigrate and then disappear, having become unrecognisable»[2]. Adorno imagines an intimacy between title and titled that does not sell. Roland Barthes, against the supreme authority <b>of</b> the <b>title</b> with regards to meaning, insisted on a fertile separation between title and oeuvre. He explored generative distances where the proper name does not exhaust the named, or, more precisely, where the relation between titles and titled can function as a terrain to play with the expectations of nominal identification [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Our talk today {{considers}} the issues facing a {{trustee in bankruptcy}} when attempting to ascertain the extent or existence of a bankrupt's interest in real property. We will highlight issues which a trustee might reasonably encounter in ascertaining the extent of property available for distribution to creditors. We will consider two elements in particular {{in light of the}} recent decision of the High Court in Cummins (a bankrupt) v Cummins, and the Federal Court in Anderson v Peldan. Both cases involved an examination of joint tenancy. Joint tenancy is one way for two or more co-owners to hold their estate in common. It will only arise where there is a <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> time, <b>title,</b> possession and interest between co-owners, and then only where there is an intention to hold as such (Property Law Act Qld provides for a presumption in favour of tenancy in common). The joint tenancy provides each co-owner the right to survivorship - upon the death of an owner that owner's estate is extinguished and the estate of surviving co-owners are enlarged proportionately to the extent of the deceased's estate. This occurs irrespective of the deceased’s testamentary wishes. Anderson v Peldan concerned the severance by an insolvent of joint tenancy held by the insolvent and his elderly spouse and whether the severance before death is capable of being a “transfer of property” in terms of s 121 of the Bankruptcy Act...|$|R
40|$|A mother, her daughter, and her {{son-in-law}} received {{title to}} a North Carolina home as joint tenants with right of survivorship. Little did the mother {{know that she}} was almost instantly destroying the newborn joint tenancy when, in order to finance the purchase price, she alone executed a mortgage note and deed of trust at the closing. When she died several years later with that mortgage loan in default, a legal dispute arose centered on whether 2 ̆ 2 severance 2 ̆ 2 of the joint tenancy had occurred. Following traditional joint tenancy law theory, the Court of Appeals decided somewhat reluctantly that the joint tenancy was indeed severed at the very closing during which it was successfully created; for by executing the deed of trust, the mother had conveyed 2 ̆ 2 title 2 ̆ 2 according to North Carolina 2 ̆ 7 s title theory of mortgage law. Under a common law 2 ̆ 2 four unities 2 ̆ 2 analysis, her execution of the deed of trust unilaterally destroyed the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> required for a joint tenancy and automatically converted it into a tenancy in common. Contrary to what was most likely intended as part of an informal family estate and eldercare plan, her fifty percent undivided interest in the home remained in her estate at her death and did not pass by survivorship to her daughter and son-in-law. 2 ̆ 7 This article addresses key real property and public policy issues triggered by the 1990 legislative reincarnation of the joint tenancy with right of survivorship in North Carolina with a special emphasis on creation and severance issues. It also focuses on piecemeal statutory amendments and revisions to North Carolina joint tenancy law since 1990. The authors 2 ̆ 7 analysis leads to the following conclusions: First, because joint tenancy creation is now intent-based, not unities-based, joint tenancy termination should likewise be intent-based, not unities-destruction-based. Second, unilateral 2 ̆ 2 stealth 2 ̆ 2 severances of joint tenancies are contrary to public policy, unless accompanied by effective prior notice to the other joint tenant or tenants. Third, North Carolina General Statute section 41 - 2 requires substantial and comprehensive revision to further clarify the contemporary law of joint tenancy in North Carolina. Fourth, substantial improvement in the law 2 ̆ 7 s transparency is required in the legislative process if all interested parties, including consumers, are to have a meaningful opportunity to provide input when important real property laws are added, revised, or deleted from the General Statutes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Frege {{proposed}} his {{doctrine of}} unsaturatedness {{as a solution}} to the problems <b>of</b> the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> the proposition and the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> the sentence.

I streamline this solution and bring it up to date. I contrast this conventionalist theory with Frege’s unsaturatedness theory. I show that Frege’s theory is mystical, ad hoc, ineffective and paradoxical, and that it entails that singular terms cannot be predicates. I argue that the conventionalist account is free of these defects and that it provides a clear and intelligible solution to the problem <b>of</b> the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> the sentence. I suggest that the problem <b>of</b> the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> the proposition is spurious. I recommend that the notion of unsaturatedness be extruded from serious debate.
