And as a doctor, I would gladly prescribe marijuana products for many of my patients who failed existing therapies if it were legal in my state.... <b>Until</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the scientific data, we should make medical marijuana available to physicians who care for people with treatment-resistant epilepsy and their patients.|$|E

The balls are therefore no longer independent. This gives a slightly different distribution known as Wallenius' noncentral hypergeometric distribution. It is far from obvious why these two distributions are different. See the entry for noncentral hypergeometric distributions for an explanation of the difference between these two distributions and a discussion of which distribution to use in various situations.|$|E

25|$|Red {{worked on}} new {{material}} for <b>Until</b> <b>We</b> <b>Have</b> Faces during their 2009–2010 tours. They travelled with a portable case that unfolds into a mini recording studio, {{allowing them to}} put down ideas {{in the green room}} at venues. In a departure from their usual songwriting methods, much of the demo material stemmed from Rauch's rhythms he developed for song ideas on his home kit, leaving {{the rest of the group}} to develop their parts from them. Barnes said the band wanted to direct the album towards the idea of someone finding their own identity, and drew inspirations from various sources, including the novel Till We Have Faces by C.S. Lewis.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{proceeds}} to motivate {{the need for}} the special sort of inquiry he calls a metaphysics of morals: “That there must be such a philosophy is evident from the common idea of duty and of moral laws.” The moral law must “carry with it absolute necessity.” (4:389) The content and the bindingness of the moral law, in other words, do not vary according to the particularities of agents or their circumstances. Given that the moral law, if it exists, is universal and necessary, the only appropriate means to investigate it is through a priori rational reflection. Thus, a correct theoretical understanding of morality requires a metaphysics of morals. Kant thinks that <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> completed this sort of investigation, “morals themselves are liable to all kinds of corruption” because the “guide and supreme norm for correctly estimating them are missing.” A fully specified account of the moral law will guard against the errors and rationalization to which human moral reasoning is prone. (4:390) The search for the supreme principle of morality—the antidote to confusion in the moral sphere—will occupy Kant for the first two chapters of the Groundwork.|$|E
500|$|After {{the launch}} of Anarchy Online and the {{subsequent}} technical problems, Funcom issued a statement to reviewers asking them to [...] "hold back on a full review <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> solved these problems." [...] Some video game reviewers, such as Computer Games Magazine, published reviews anyway; others, such as GameSpy who described the game as [...] "nearly unplayable", chose to wait one month before publishing a formal review. The troubled release has had a lasting effect on the game's reputation, [...] and is nearly always mentioned in the generally positive reviews of later expansion packs as a juxtaposition.|$|E

500|$|This {{should not}} be {{confused}} with a value of 0. [...] A null value indicates a lack of a value - a lack of a value is not the same thing as a value of zero in the same way that a lack of an answer is not the same thing as an answer of [...] "no". [...] For example, consider the question [...] "How many books does Adam own?" [...] The answer may be [...] "zero" [...] (we know that he owns none) or [...] "null" [...] (we do not know how many he owns).

[...] Les King, {{a former member of}} the ACMD, has stated mephedrone appears to be less potent than amphetamine and ecstasy, but that any benefit associated with this could be negated by users taking larger amounts. He also told the BBC, [...] "all we can say is [...] is probably as harmful as ecstasy and amphetamines and wait <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> some better scientific evidence to support that." ...|$|E

[...] Both the Sunni al-Qaeda and [...] "Islamic State" [...] consider Shia Muslims to be heretics.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Until</b> <b>We</b> <b>Have</b> Faces was {{released}} on February 1, 2011. The band released a teaser video online, featuring the band's name {{on a sheet of}} parchment which burns away and revealing the album's title. A picture was posted on Graves's Twitter account showing three guitars with tape on them showing tunings of A#, A, and G#, which hinted that this record may be heavier than the previous two. As part of the preliminary hype for the album, Red asked fans to send photos of their faces to the band. On December 9, codes were given to all fans that sent in pictures of their faces to download an MP3 for the song [...] "Feed the Machine". The fan photos were used to create a mosaic poster. Red promoted the album's release with performances on the network television shows Late Night with Conan O'Brien and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, their first television appearances. The album also debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200. [...] "Feed the Machine" [...] started to be added to Active Rock Radio stations in mid-February. <b>Until</b> <b>We</b> <b>Have</b> Faces has sold approximately 100,000 copies in the US.

2500|$|Porter began then final {{portions}} of his address by further stressing {{the importance of}} general education, specifically {{in the state of}} Pennsylvania.

2500|$|After they {{recorded}} several demos that {{displayed a}} style of alternative, hard, and Christian rock music, Red landed a development deal with their longtime producer Rob Graves {{which led to a}} record deal with Christian label Essential Records in 2004. Their debut albums End of Silence (2006) and Innocence & Instinct (2009) were nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Gospel Album, and spawned the popular singles [...] "Breathe Into Me" [...] and [...] "Death of Me". Red's mainstream popularity grew and their third album, <b>Until</b> <b>We</b> <b>Have</b> Faces (2011), reached No. 2 on the Billboard 200, which was followed by Release the Panic (2013), which peaked at No. 7. After Of Beauty and Rage (2015), Red started work on their sixth album, Gone (2017), which released in October 2017.|$|E
2500|$|Crick {{occasionally}} {{expressed his}} views on eugenics, usually in private letters.

It is not a subject at the moment which we can tackle easily because people have so many religious beliefs and <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a more uniform view of ourselves I think it would be risky to try and do anything in the way of eugenics...
