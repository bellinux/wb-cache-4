After World WarI, Nauru became a League of Nations mandate {{administered}} by Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. During World WarII, Nauru was occupied by Japanese troops, who were bypassed by the Allied advance across the Pacific. After the war ended, the country entered into <b>UN</b> <b>trusteeship.</b> Nauru gained its independence in 1968.|$|E
5|$|Southwest Africa has a {{rich history}} {{encompassing}} colonisation, war and genocide. The first European {{to set foot}} on Namibian soil was the Portuguese explorer Diogo Cão in 1485. Over the next 500 years, the country was colonised by the Dutch, English and Germans. Namibia was a German colony (German South-West Africa) from 1884 until its annexation by South Africa during World War I. After the war, it was mandated to South Africa by the League of Nations. After World War II the United Nations (UN) asked South Africa to place Namibia under <b>UN</b> <b>trusteeship,</b> but South Africa refused. Legal arguments continued until 1966 when the UN General Assembly resolved to end the mandate, declaring that henceforth South-West Africa was the direct responsibility of the UN.|$|E
5|$|The Embassy of the United States of America to Somalia was a {{diplomatic}} {{mission of the}} United States in Mogadishu, Somalia from 1960 to 1991. In 1957, the US opened a Consulate-General in Mogadishu—the capital of the Trust Territory of Somalia, a <b>UN</b> <b>trusteeship</b> under Italian administration. The consulate was upgraded to embassy status in July 1960, when the US recognized Somalia's independence and appointed an ambassador. The embassy served to counter Soviet influence during the Cold War and {{also served as a}} base for the United States Agency for International Development, which had a large presence in the country.

50|$|The sole {{exception}} to the transformation of League of Nations mandates into <b>UN</b> <b>trusteeships</b> was that South Africa refused to place South-West Africa under trusteeship. Instead, South Africa proposed that it be allowed to annex South-West Africa, a proposal rejected by the United Nations General Assembly. The International Court of Justice held that South Africa continued to have international obligations under the mandate for South-West Africa. The territory finally attained independence in 1990 as Namibia, after a long guerrilla war of independence against the apartheid regime.|$|R

25|$|The {{shilling}} {{was also}} used in parts {{of what is now}} Somalia, Ethiopia, and Eritrea when they were under British control. Before 1941, these areas, then known as Italian East Africa, were using the Italian East African lira. In 1941, as a result of World War II, Britain regained control and introduced the shilling, at a rate of 1 shilling to 24 lira. Italian Somaliland was returned to Italy in 1949 as a <b>UN</b> <b>Trusteeship</b> and soon switched to the Italian Somaliland somalo, which was at par with the shilling. British Somaliland gained independence in 1960, and joined what had been Italian Somaliland to create Somalia. In that year, Somalia began using the Somali shilling (replacing the Somali somalo) at par with the East African shilling.|$|E
25|$|After World War II, in August 1945 President Truman {{asked for}} the {{admission}} of 100,000 Holocaust survivors into Palestine but the British maintained limits on Jewish immigration {{in line with the}} 1939 White Paper. The Jewish community rejected the restriction on immigration and organized an armed resistance. These actions and United States pressure to end the anti-immigration policy led to the establishment of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry. In April 1946, the Committee reached a unanimous decision for the immediate admission of 100,000 Jewish refugees from Europe into Palestine, rescission of the white paper restrictions of land sale to Jews, that the country be neither Arab nor Jewish, and the extension of <b>U.N.</b> <b>Trusteeship.</b> U.S. endorsed the Commission findings concerning Jewish immigration and land purchase restrictions, while U.K. conditioned their implementation on U.S. assistance in case of another Arab revolt. In effect the British continued to carry out its White Paper policy. The recommendations triggered violent demonstrations in the Arab states, and calls for a Jihad and an annihilation of all European Jews in Palestine.|$|E

The plan proposed the establishment of Arab and Jewish states in Palestine. The Arabs had rejected the plan while the Jews had accepted it. For four months, under continuous Arab provocation and attack, the Yishuv was usually on the defensive while occasionally retaliating. By March 1948 however, the United States was actively seeking a temporary <b>UN</b> approved <b>trusteeship</b> rather than immediate partition, {{known as the}} Truman trusteeship proposal. The Jewish leadership rejected this. By now, both Jewish and Arab militias had begun campaigns to control territory {{inside and outside the}} designated borders, and an open war between the two populations emerged.|$|R

A referendum was held in neighboring Djibouti (then known as French Somaliland) in 1958, on the eve of Somalia's independence in 1960, to decide whether or not to join the Somali Republic or to remain with France. The referendum turned out in favour of a continued association with France, largely due to a combined yes vote by the sizable Afar ethnic group and resident Europeans. There was also allegations of widespread vote rigging, with the French expelling thousands of Somalis before the referendum reached the polls. The majority of those who voted [...] "no" [...] were Somalis who were strongly in favour of joining a united Somalia, as had been proposed by Mahmoud Harbi, Vice President of the Government Council.
