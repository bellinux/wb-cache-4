5|$|In {{the second}} episode, during the outdoor scene after Alphonse's funeral, a tram stop sign can be seen. This style {{and design of}} tram signage wasn't {{introduced}} <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> the 2000s.|$|E
5|$|The {{statue of}} Neptune is often {{described}} as a giant. The area around the original location of the fountain remained known as fuq l–iġgant (on the giant) <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the game, the Hokies struggled on offense and were held scoreless <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> the second quarter. Kansas, however, was able to get on the board several times, jumping to a 17–0 lead before Virginia Tech scored its first points. Kansas's broke the game open in the first quarter after All-American cornerback Aqib Talib intercepted a pass by backup Virginia Tech quarterback Tyrod Taylor and returned the ball 60yards for the game's opening points.|$|E
2500|$|These {{two systems}} of {{constructing}} iron railways, the [...] "L" [...] plate-rail and the smooth edge-rail, {{continued to exist}} side by side <b>until</b> <b>well</b> on <b>into</b> the early 19th century. The flanged wheel and edge-rail eventually proved its superiority and became the standard for railways.|$|R
50|$|Designed for {{and largely}} {{operated}} in London, over 2,800 AEC Routemasters were built between 1956 and 1968, with a design so robust that the Routemaster outlasted newer buses intended to replace it, remaining in use <b>until</b> 2005, <b>well</b> <b>into</b> the deregulated era.|$|R
25|$|Two saddle-tank {{locomotives}} were {{supplied to}} the East London Harbour Board in 1902, built by Hunslet. Both survived <b>until</b> the 1930s, <b>well</b> <b>into</b> the SAR era.|$|R
5|$|Harrison {{completed}} the song's vocals by late February, {{soon after his}} 30th birthday. He then travelled to Los Angeles {{for a series of}} Beatles-related business meetings held at the offices of Apple's US distributor, Capitol Records, primarily to discuss the upcoming Beatles compilations 1962–1966 and 1967–1970. While these two double albums were intended to foil bootleggers, Doggett notes that the profits financed the Beatles' litigation against Klein <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> 1974.|$|E
5|$|Holloway {{continued}} to perform <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> his eighties, touring Asia and Australia in 1977 together with Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and David Langton in The Pleasure of His Company, by Samuel A. Taylor and Cornelia Otis Skinner. He made his last appearance performing at the Royal Variety Performance at the London Palladium in 1980, aged 89.|$|E
5|$|Rebuilding and {{refurbishing}} {{the palace}} took <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> the 1950s, with full restoration not completed until the 1990s. In 1989 a large trompe-l'œil fresco depicting the Roman goddess Ceres was rediscovered behind layers of plaster and white {{paint in the}} former dining hall, the eastern wing of the Synod Hall (see below, Apartments). It {{is thought to have}} been concealed under Napoleonic ownership, and had been forgotten since.|$|E
50|$|It's {{a monumental}} magnum opus {{on the former}} Barcelona economy, noting the aspects that made the city one of the trading powers of the Mediterranean {{starting}} in the Middle Ages <b>until</b> <b>well</b> entered <b>into</b> the sixteenth century: its important merchant marine, strong guild structure and industrial productivity all supported by numerous documents from its archives, many of them unpublished until then.|$|R
5000|$|However, fatefully, {{one of the}} [...] "dahlgrens" [...] {{exploded}} on being tested in 1860, causing Navy regulations to {{require the use of}} much lower levels of powder <b>until</b> 1864, <b>well</b> <b>into</b> the Civil War. The commander of USS Monitor felt that had his gunner packed the cannons with a full charge, he {{might have been able to}} destroy CSS Virginia.|$|R
5000|$|He was a Radiographer. After the war, he {{returned}} to Kiev and did hospital work <b>until</b> he was <b>well</b> <b>into</b> his 70s. On 21 February 1987 he received the Order of the Patriotic War 2nd class.|$|R
5|$|The Swiss {{program is}} {{considering}} {{options for the}} siting of a deep repository for high-level radioactive waste disposal, and for low & intermediate level wastes. Construction of a repository is not foreseen <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> this century. Research on sedimentary rock (especially Opalinus Clay) is carried out at the Swiss Mont Terri rock laboratory; the Grimsel Test Site, an older facility in crystalline rock is also still active.|$|E
5|$|The minuet is in F major, {{but it is}} not <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> {{its second}} half that a strong chord in the tonic arrives. Once again among the Opus 50 minuets, Haydn is unsettling {{harmonic}} conventions. Haydn also toys with metre {{towards the end of the}} minuet: it moves into, and concludes, essentially in duple time. The trio follows, and its theme almost identical to that of the minuet, albeit in a minor key and played by all four parts in unison.|$|E
5|$|While certain beliefs {{regarding}} {{the effectiveness of}} tobacco smoke to protect against disease persisted <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> the 20th century, the use of smoke enemas in Western medicine declined after 1811, when through animal experimentation Benjamin Brodie demonstrated that nicotine—the principal active agent in tobacco smoke—is a cardiac poison that can stop the circulation of blood.|$|E
50|$|At the battle, on 21 October 1805, Thunderers {{position}} was towards {{the rear of}} Collingwood's division, and so she did not reach the action <b>until</b> <b>well</b> on <b>into</b> the day. Nonetheless, Stockham and Thunderer performed admirably, engaging the Spanish flagship Principe de Asturias and the French Neptune. Thunderer suffered 16 casualties but remained largely intact, which enabled her to aid more battered ships during the storm which followed.|$|R
50|$|Dillon was a Francophile {{both because}} he had French origins and for his own {{personal}} tastes. In 1929, he purchased an apartment in Paris where he stayed a part of each year <b>until</b> he was <b>well</b> <b>into</b> his 80s.|$|R
25|$|He {{continued}} to play club cricket in Halifax <b>until</b> he was <b>well</b> <b>into</b> his forties. In 1922, he had an operation to remove some cancer, but it acted only to prolong his life. He died on 12 September 1925 in Halifax.|$|R
5|$|Woo is {{cast as a}} villain, {{underscored by}} her {{frequent}} appearance to the theme music that accompanied the Wicked Witch of the West in the Wizard of Oz. Unlike a melodramatic villain such as J. R. Ewing, Ling was cast as a remarkably heartless character <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> the second season (Season 3 of the show), when she begins to befriend other characters.|$|E
5|$|According to Constantine VII, the Slavs rose {{up again}} in the early 840s, but were {{defeated}} by strategos Theoktistos Bryennios. In the south, the two tribes of the Ezeritai and Melingoi held out longer. They were eventually subdued and forced to pay heavy tribute, but retained their autonomy. These two tribes rose up again a century later, in 921. Again they were quickly subdued, this time by the strategos Krenites Arotras, but managed to remain autonomous and retain their distinct identity <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> Frankish times.|$|E
5|$|Anna and Michael Ancher, Krøyer and Tuxen {{continued}} to paint in Skagen <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> the 20th century and were occasionally joined by their earlier friends. Two core {{members of the}} group, Drachmann and Krøyer, died in 1908 and 1909, bringing the traditional gatherings of the group to an end. There were nevertheless other painters, {{sometimes referred to as}} the younger group of Skagen painters, who {{continued to}} visit the area. They included Jørgen Aabye, Tupsy and Gad Frederik Clement, Ella Heide, Ludvig Karsten, Frederik Lange and Johannes Wilhjelm, some of whom settled in the area until the 1930s or even later. Skagens Museum has a number of their works in its collection.|$|E
5000|$|As with [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody", most of {{the guitar}} parts on this song were {{initially}} played on piano by Mercury, to demonstrate to May how {{they needed to be}} played on guitar. [...] "Death on Two Legs" [...] remained on the setlist <b>until,</b> and <b>well</b> <b>into,</b> The Game Tour in 1980, and was then dropped. However, the piano introduction was played during the Hot Space and Works tours.|$|R
50|$|In {{keeping with}} his evangelical views, Aberhart added a {{heavy dose of}} social {{conservatism}} to Douglas' original ideas. Most notably, he enacted very tight restrictions on the sale of alcohol. Indeed, the only stricter law in Canada at the time was in Prince Edward Island, where the sale of alcohol remained completely banned <b>until</b> 1948. <b>Well</b> <b>into</b> the 1960s, commercial airlines could not serve alcohol while flying over Alberta.|$|R
50|$|Bromley was {{not able}} to return to {{parliament}} <b>until</b> early March, <b>well</b> <b>into</b> the next session. He was initially fairly active and {{was a member of the}} committee dealing with the attainder of the Gunpowder plotters. Thereafter, his parliamentary activity steadily lessened.|$|R
5|$|From {{the early}} 16th century, the {{establishment}} of a harbour at the East Burn confirmed the town's early role as an important trading port. The town also began to develop around the salt, coal mining and nail making industries. The production of linen which followed in 1672 was later instrumental in the introduction of floorcloth in 1847 by linen manufacturer, Michael Nairn. In 1877 this in turn contributed to linoleum, which became the town's most successful industry: Kirkcaldy was a world producer <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> the mid-1960s. The town expanded considerably in the 1950s and 1960s, though the decline of the linoleum industry and other manufacturing restricted its growth thereafter.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} period, the Sicilian Muslims also {{established}} footholds in the Italian mainland. The Muslims {{were asked to}} assist the beleaguered Duchy of Naples against Sicard of Benevento in 839, but then they sacked Brindisi and, following Sicard's murder and the outbreak of {{civil war in the}} Principality of Benevento, seized Tarentum in 840 and Bari in 847, which they made their bases. <b>Until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> the 880s, the Muslims would launch destructive raids along the coasts of Italy and into the Adriatic Sea from their bases on the Italian mainland — most notably from the Emirate of Bari, until its destruction in 871.|$|E
5|$|One of Bach's {{predecessors}} {{as director}} musices of the Neukirche in Leipzig was Melchior Hoffmann. Around 1707 he composed a German Magnificat based on Luther's German {{translation of the}} Magnificat. The portfolio of performance parts of this composition was updated <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> Bach's time in Leipzig. The work, known as Kleine Magnificat (Little Magnificat), was for some time attributed to Bach, but later listed as spurious in the BWV catalogue (BWVAnh.21 / Anh. III 168‑>). BWV189, a Visitation cantata on a libretto that paraphrases {{the text of the}} Magnificat canticle, also seems rather to have been composed by Hoffmann than by Bach, to whom this work used to be attributed.|$|E
50|$|He {{loved his}} garden and woodlands, enjoyed shooting, {{and was a}} fine golfer at Royal and Ancient at St Andrews, where he reached {{the final of the}} Jubilee Vase in 1953; he {{continued}} to play regularly <b>until</b> he was <b>well</b> <b>into</b> his eighties.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the leaf}} {{of the door}} the lock is {{in the shape of}} a snake, found in many churches in the country. The shape, rooted in the Romanesque period, lasted <b>well</b> <b>until</b> <b>into</b> the Baroque period.|$|R
50|$|At 23:04, the Kiev grid {{controller}} {{allowed the}} reactor shutdown to resume. This delay had some serious consequences: the day shift {{had long since}} departed, the evening shift was also preparing to leave, and the night shift would not take over <b>until</b> midnight, <b>well</b> <b>into</b> the job. According to plan, the test should have been finished during the day shift, and the night shift would only have had to maintain decay heat cooling systems in an otherwise shut-down plant.|$|R
5|$|Qutayba's role in {{the conquest}} and gradual Islamization of Central Asia was crucial, and in later times, a number of {{locations}} in Ferghana where his tomb was supposedly located (Narshakhi and Jamal Qarsh) were venerated by pilgrims. His descendants too continued to hold influential positions: his son Qatan served as governor of Bukhara, Salm, another son, governed Basra and Rayy, and his nephew Muslim was governor of Balkh. His grandsons, especially the numerous sons of Salm, continued in high office under the Abbasids <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> the 9th century.|$|E
5|$|Soybean {{cultivation}}: The {{cultivation of}} soybeans {{began in the}} eastern half of northern China by 2000 BC, but is almost certainly much older. Liu et al. (1997) stated that soybean originated in China and was domesticated about 3500 BC. By the 5th century, soybeans were being cultivated in much of eastern Asia, but the crop did not move beyond this region <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> the 20th century. Written records of the cultivation and use of the soybean in China date back {{at least as far as}} the Western Zhou Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The college's {{undergraduate}} gossip sheet {{is entitled}} The Sheepshagger in allusion to an offensive joke about Welsh people's supposed penchant for sheep. Furthermore, the Welshness of the College is self-perpetuating, as Welsh students will often apply to Jesus {{because it is}} seen as the Welsh college. Old members recall the college having a majority of Welsh members <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>into</b> the 20th century; today, however, around 15% of undergraduates come from Wales. For comparison, residents of Wales comprise just under 5% of the United Kingdom population (2.9million {{out of a total of}} 58.8million at the time of the 2001 Census).|$|E
5000|$|Archaeological {{records and}} ancient Chinese sources Book of Song {{indicate}} that the various tribes and chiefdom of the Japanese Archipelago did not begin to coalesce into more centralized and hierarchical polities <b>until</b> 300 (<b>well</b> <b>into</b> the Kofun period), when large tombs begin to appear while there were no contacts between the Wa and China. Some describe the [...] "mysterious century" [...] as a time of internecine warfare as various local monarchies competed for hegemony on Kyūshū and Honshū.|$|R
5000|$|In a sense, Pascal's {{invention}} was premature, in {{that the}} mechanical arts in his time were not sufficiently advanced to enable his machine to be made at an economic price, with the accuracy and strength needed for reasonably long use. This difficulty was not overcome <b>until</b> <b>well</b> on <b>into</b> the nineteenth century, by which time also a renewed stimulus to invention was given by the need for many kinds of calculation more intricate than those considered by Pascal.

2500|$|Harris {{continued}} to work <b>until</b> 2009, <b>well</b> <b>into</b> her eighties, narrating five historical documentaries by Christopher Seufert and Mooncusser Films, {{as well as being}} active as a director {{on the board of the}} independent Wellfleet Harbor Actors Theater. She also did extensive voice work for documentary maker Ken Burns: the voices of Emily Warren Roebling in Brooklyn Bridge, Ann Lee in , Susan B. Anthony in [...] and most notably Southern diarist Mary Boykin Chesnut for Burns' 1990 series The Civil War.|$|R
