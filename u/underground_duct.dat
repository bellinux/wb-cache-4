In Provence, a typical village fountain consisted of a pipe or <b>underground</b> <b>duct</b> from a spring at a higher elevation than the fountain. The water from the spring flowed down to the fountain, then up a tube into a bulb-shaped stone vessel, like a large vase with a cover on top. The inside of the vase, called the bassin de répartition, was filled with water up to a level just above the mouths of the canons, or spouts, which slanted downwards. The water poured down through the canons, creating a siphon, so that the fountain ran continually.|$|E

40|$|The Site Electrical Power System {{receives}} and distributes {{utility power}} to all North Portal site users. The major North Portal users are the Protected Area including the subsurface facility and Balance of Plant areas. The system is remotely monitored and controlled from the Surface Operations Monitoring and Control System. The system monitors power quality {{and provides the}} capability to transfer between Off-Site Utility and standby power (including dedicated safeguards and security power). Standby power is only distributed to selected loads for personnel safety and essential operations. Security power is only distributed to essential security operations. The standby safeguards and security power is independent from all other site power. The system also provides surface lighting, grounding grid, and lightning protection for the North Portal. The system distributes power during construction, operation, caretaker, and closure phases of the repository. The system consists of substation equipment (disconnect switches, breakers, transformers and grounding equipment) and power distribution cabling from substation to the north portal switch gear building. Additionally, the system includes subsurface facility substation (located on surface), switch-gear, standby diesel generators, <b>underground</b> <b>duct</b> banks, power cables and conduits, switch-gear building and associated distribution equipment for power distribution. Each area substation distributes power to the electrical loads and includes the site grounding, site lighting and lightning protection equipment. The site electrical power system distributes power of sufficient quantity and quality to meet users demands. The Site Electrical Power System interfaces with the North Portal surface systems requiring electrical power. The system interfaces with the Subsurface Electrical Distribution System which will supply power to the underground facilities from the North Portal. Power required for the South Portal and development side activities of the subsurface facility will be provided at the South Portal by the Subsurface Electrical Distribution System.

40|$|The <b>underground</b> air <b>ducts</b> along {{peripheral}} {{walls of}} a building are a remediation method, which principle is to enable an air flow along the moist building structure’s surface to allow a sufficient evaporation of moisture from the structure. This measure reduces the water transport (rising moisture) into the higher parts of the wall where the high water content in masonry is undesirable. Presently, <b>underground</b> air <b>ducts</b> are designed as masonry structures, which durability in contact with ground moisture is limited.

5000|$|Because of a {{stringent}} Post Office {{requirement to}} limit field strength {{at the campus}} boundary to 100 microvolts per metre, {{and the presence of}} a strong signal on an adjacent channel, the transmitter could not be simply coupled to a single, central antenna. A scheme was devised to use individual [...] "infinitesimal" [...] passive loop antennae in each residential tower, fed by coaxial cable and carefully phased in pairs to cancel the external field. The coaxial cable had to be carefully laid out to produce the required accuracy of phasing, and splitting transformers were used to reduce power loss. The antennae were in protected ducts inside the residential buildings, and their frames were lightly built of hardboard and spruce. Since the splitting transformers were in <b>underground</b> <b>ducts,</b> they were housed in robust die-cast boxes. Despite the crudity of its construction, this system produced a strong signal of about 10mV/metre inside the residential towers, while still meeting the requirement for a negligible signal at the campus boundary. Test equipment to confirm its correct operation, including portable field-strength meters and their calibration gear, was improvised. Subsequent Post Office testing with professional equipment confirmed that the system met its goals.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} end pylons of the Sydney Harbour Bridge were altered {{to allow for}} air exhaust from the tunnel to rise over the harbour. Bradfield Park on the northern {{side of the bridge}} also has air intakes.Fresh air is drawn by an underground ventilation station on the north shore and is pumped to all sections of the tunnel through vented ducts. The air supply uses fourteen axial flow fans, each up to 2.5 metres in diameter. The exhaust uses sixteen (eight in each northern pylon tower) fans that draw exhaust air through two <b>underground</b> <b>ducts</b> from the tunnel ventillation station and transfer the air {{to the top of the}} pylon. They can expel it at up to 1 500 m³/s - equivalent to changing all the air in the tunnel every two minutes with the capability of running in reverse in an emergency and all fans are rated for smoke extraction. Each of the fans has a duty of 53 to 103 m³/s. The testing of the fans was one of the most comprehensive ever, covering flowrate and pressure, power measurements, sound levels, bearing vibration, x-raying of all impeller components, high-temperature tests at 200 °C for 2 hours, impeller strain, and 24-hour run tests for reversals.|$|R
40|$|In {{industrial}} plants, oil and oil compounds {{are usually}} transported by closed pipelines with circular cross-section.

Inspection techniques using radiotracers are non-destructive, simple, economic and highly accurate. Among them, Total Count, which uses {{a small amount of}} radiotracer with known activity, is acknowledged as an absolute technique for flow rate measurement. A viscous fluid transport system, composed by four PVC pipelines with 13 m length (12 m horizontal and 1 m vertical) and ½, ¾, 1 and 2 -inch gauges, respectively, interconnected by maneuvering valves was designed and assembled in order to conduct the research. This system was used to simulate different flow conditions of petroleum compounds and for experimental studies of flow profile in the horizontal and upward directions. As 198 Au presents a single photopeak (411, 8 keV), it was the radioisotope chosen for oil labeling, in small amounts (6 ml) or around 200 kBq activity, and it was injected in the oil transport lines.

40|$|The Swedish {{government}} {{has introduced a}} goal to reduce the energy intensity by 20 % to the year 2020. To reach this goal actions {{need to be taken}} throughout the energy sector which includes residential and commercial buildings. This thesis considers the possibility to reduce the energy usage in a building located close to Uppsala. The analyzed building is a combined office, cafeteria and entrance and was completed about half a year before this project started. Therefore the measures presented for a more energy efficient building are presented as measures for future constructions. Simulations have been made in VIP-Energy, a dynamic energy calculation program. The measures that have been evaluated are added insulation to roof and walls and change of windows to those with a better U-value. The results showed that the added insulation is not recommended because of the small savings compared to the investments. The use of better windows, on the other hand, would be economically viable according to the results. The better windows reduced the energy consumption by 4 MWh/year which gave a pay-back time of 16 years. Alternative energy supply systems for the studied building are also presented. The analyzed systems are pellet boiler, solar heating and two types of pre-heating/pre-cooling of ventilation air with ground heat. The most viable of these alternatives were the pre-heating/pre-cooling of the ventilation air with <b>underground</b> <b>ducts</b> which had a pay-back time of 21 years...|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{containment}} system failures are detected by monitoring wells downstream {{of the waste}} site. Clearly this approach is inefficient, as the contaminants will have migrated from the disposal area before they are detected. Methods that indicate early cover failure (prior to contaminant release) or predict impending cover failure are needed. The Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) Perfluorocarbon Tracer (PFT) technology can measure performance changes and integrity losses as the cover ages. This allows early detection of cover failure or pending failure so that repair or replacement can be made before contaminants leave the disposal cell. The PFT technology has been successfully applied to four subsurface barrier problems, one leak detection problem from <b>underground</b> <b>ducts,</b> and one surface cover problem. Testing has demonstrated that the PFTs are capable of accurately detecting and locating leaks down to fractions of an inch. The PFT technology has several advantages over competing approaches. The ability to simultaneously use multiple PFTs separates it from other gas tracer technologies. Using multiple tracers provides independent confirmation of flaw location, helps to clearly define transport pathways, {{and can be used}} for confirmatory testing (e. g., repeat the test using a new tracer). The PFT tests provide a direct measure of flaws in a barrier, whereas other measurements (pressure, moisture content, temperature, subsidence) provide indirect measures that need interpretation. The focus of the six PFT demonstrations has been on engineering aspects of the technology with the intent of finding if a flaw existed in the barrier. Work remains to be done on the scientific basis for this technology. This includes determining PFT diffusion rates through various materials (soils and barrier) as a function of moisture content, determining the effects of barometric pumping on PFT flow for cover systems, and determining wind effects on side slopes of cover systems and their impact on PFT performance. It also includes application of models to assist {{in the design of the}} monitoring system and the interpretation of the data. The set of demonstrations was performed on small sites (< 1 / 4 acre). Future work also needs to consider scaling issues to develop and design optimal techniques for delivery and monitoring of the PFTs...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports of}} several new soil {{treatment}} methods in Japan, which include 1) a liquefied soil stabilizing method to re-use construction sludge and excavated surplus soils, 2) a high-speed continuous soil treatment system using pipe-line mixers and a light-weight banking method which utilize in-situ surface soil without purchase and carrying of fill materials.
