5|$|In Boston, an {{undercover}} cop {{waits for the}} subway, alone. Suddenly, a suspicious man appears, jumping the fare barrier. Eventually, they both get onto a train and the police officer draws his gun as the man starts to walk towards him from behind. Suddenly, the subway comes to a screeching halt, flashes of light are seen, and the train loses power. Later, when the train is back <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>running,</b> a batch of commuters enter the subway car and find the undercover cop with the flesh on half his face and his left arm stripped down to the bone.|$|E

5|$|NASA {{has named}} {{the rim of}} Shackleton as a {{potential}} candidate for its lunar outpost, slated to be <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>running</b> by 2020 and continuously staffed by a crew by 2024. The location would promote self-sustainability for lunar residents, as perpetual sunlight on the south pole would provide energy for solar panels. Furthermore, the shadowed polar regions are believed to contain the frozen water necessary for human consumption and could also be harvested for fuel manufacture.|$|E

5|$|During 1943 and 1944, the Metallurgical Laboratory {{focused on}} first getting the X-10 Graphite Reactor at the Clinton Engineer Works <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>running,</b> {{and then the}} B Reactor at the Hanford Site. By the end of 1944, the focus had {{switched}} to training operators. Much of the chemistry division moved to Oak Ridge in October 1943, and many personnel were transferred to other Manhattan Project sites in 1944, particularly Hanford and Los Alamos. Fermi became a division head at Los Alamos in September 1944, and Zinn became {{the director of the}} Argonne Laboratory. Allison followed in November 1944, taking with him many of the Metallurgical Laboratory's staff, including most of the instrument section. He was replaced by Joyce C. Stearns. Farrington Daniels, who became associate director on 1 September 1944, succeeded Stearns as director on 1 July 1945.|$|E

RPO measures the ability to recover files by specifying a point in time restore of the backup copy.|$|E

The ironworks closed once again in 1910. The works briefly made a comeback during the First World War but finally closed for good in 1919.|$|E

30|$|The sixth message {{drawn from}} the case study data is that cities which have {{implemented}} URUC have achieved significant levels of revenue for reinvestment.

Indeed {{in many cases the}} provision of extra capacity in public transport is a key prerequisite before URUC is introduced.|$|R
