500|$|Connor Trinneer (who played Commander Trip Tucker), {{felt that}} the finale {{should have had a}} memorable {{farewell}} that he described as a [...] "M*A*S*H moment", but that the producers did not want to focus on such an element. Anthony Montgomery (who played Ensign Travis Mayweather) was similarly displeased with the finale and said [...] "I feel there could have been a more effective way to wrap things <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> show as well as the franchise as a whole. It just seemed to take a little bit away from what the Enterprise cast and crew worked so diligently to achieve over the past four years." [...] While Frakes enjoyed working with Sirtis again, he said that [...] "the reality is {{it was a bit of}} a stretch to have us shut down [...] show," [...] and that in hindsight it was a disservice to them. The early criticism forced the show's producers to hold a conference and address the issue. Braga admitted there was cast unrest, but defended the episode as a way to close not just Enterprise but Star Trek as a whole.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2011, Feingold formed Progressives United, a Political Action Committee, and an {{affiliated}} nonprofit entity called Progressives United Inc. Progressives United's stated aim was [...] "directly {{and indirectly}} supporting candidates who stand <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> progressive ideals." [...] From 2011 to 2015, {{the two groups}} raised and spent $10 million. The PAC has helped raise money for more than 50 progressive candidates, including the largest beneficiary, then-candidate Elizabeth Warren, who successfully defeated incumbent Scott Brown in 2012. Progressives United Inc. shut down in late 2014, and the Progressives United PAC suspended its fundraising activities in May 2015 {{in order to avoid}} the appearance of a conflict of interest with Feingold's 2016 Senate campaign.|$|E
2500|$|On January 15, 2010, Santorum sent {{an email}} and letter to {{supporters}} {{of his political}} action committee, saying, [...] "I'm convinced that conservatives need a candidate who will not only stand <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> views, but who can articulate a conservative vision for our country's future". He continued, [...] "And right now, I just don't see anyone stepping up to the plate. I have no great burning desire to be president, but I have a burning desire {{to have a different}} president of the United States". He formed a presidential exploratory committee on April 13, 2011. Santorum has also referred to his grandfather's historical encounter with Italian fascism as an inspiration for his 2012 presidential campaign.|$|E

2500|$|Angela Merkel is a Lutheran {{member of}} the Evangelical Church in Berlin, Brandenburg and Silesian Upper Lusatia (...) , a United Protestant (i.e. both Reformed and Lutheran) church body under the {{umbrella}} of the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD). The EKBO is a church of the Prussian Union. Before the 2004 merger of the Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg and the Evangelical Church in Silesian Upper Lusatia (both also being a part of the EKD), she belonged to the former. In 2012, Merkel said, regarding her faith: [...] "I am a {{member of the}} evangelical church. I believe in God and religion is also my constant companion, and has been for the whole of my life. We as Christians should above all not be afraid of standing <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> beliefs." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Loubser {{replaced}} Cri-Zelda Brits as {{the captain}} of the South African team, when the selectors opted to let Brits focus on her batting for the 2009 Women's Cricket World Cup. The convenor of selectors, Denise Reid, said that Loubser was [...] "a suitable and capable replacement." [...] During the World Cup, South Africa lost all three of their matches, and were eliminated in the group stage, though they then won the seventh place play-off. Loubser had an unsuccessful tournament, bowling over 20 overs without claiming a wicket. She retained the captaincy for the subsequent 2009 ICC Women's World Twenty20. South Africa were once again eliminated from the competition in the group stage, though Loubser did claim three wickets, albeit with an economy in excess of seven. Leading South Africa in their subsequent series against the West Indies, Loubser targeted a clean sweep, aiming to [...] "make <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> poor record." [...] The teams split the series: South Africa won the ODIs 2–1 with one match tied, while the West Indies won all three of the T20Is.|$|E
2500|$|This is {{a concept}} similar to Anselm's that we owe a debt of honor to God, with a {{critical}} difference: While Anselm said we could never pay this because any good we could do was owed to God anyway, Aquinas says {{that in addition to}} our due of obedience we can make <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> debt through acts of penance [...] "man owes God all that he is able to give him...over and above which he can offer something by way of satisfaction". Unlike Anselm, Aquinas claims that we can make satisfaction for our own sin, and that our problem is not our personal sin, but original sin. [...] "Original sin...is an infection of human nature itself, so that, unlike actual sin, it could not be expiated by the satisfaction of a mere man." [...] Thus Christ, as the [...] "second Adam," [...] does penance in our place – paying the debt of our original sin. Why does he do that? By love. The whole of the work of redemption begins with God’s love: “God so loved the world that he gave his only Son” (Jn 3:16).|$|E
