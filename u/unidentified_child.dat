40|$|The work {{follows the}} current {{legislation}} dealing with matters of parenthood. It is designed {{in accordance with}} the breakdown of motherhood and fatherhood. After an introduction, defining the purpose and need for legal regulation of family issues, follow the main chapters dealing with different issues. First, attention is paid to the determination of motherhood. This section is divided into three chapters, the first of which is further divided for clarity even in the following sections. The first chapter is devoted to the issue of child identity undetected. This chapter is further divided into parts and special sections devoted to the identity of <b>unidentified</b> <b>child,</b> called the found child, another sub-chapter describes the legislation and the possibility of using the birth mother's identity and privacy of anonymous births, and the last sub-sections deal with the problem of their baby boxes, and legal issues. In other chapters of the work deals with the erroneous entry in the matrix and the state where the child is born outside the medical facility. Then follow chapters on the determination and denial of paternity. The work follows a system of three statutory presumptions of paternity and the subsequent denial of the possibility of paternity. So the first presumption of paternity mother indicating [...] ...|$|E

40|$|This report {{documents}} the exhumation and reburial of three historic graves within {{the right of}} way of Interstate Highway 10 (IH- 10) near the intersection of Eldridge Drive. Called the Eldridge or Oscar Abstein Cemetery, historic research indicated that three to four graves probably existed near station marker 581 + 75 within the area of improvements that the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) proposed to IH- 10. TxDOT’s Archeological Studies Program, Environmental Affairs Division, prepared a planning document entitled: “Exhumation and Reinterment Plan, IH- 10, CSJ: 0271 - 07 - 247, Eldridge Cemetery” and contracted with Prewitt and Associates, Inc., of Austin, Texas, to conduct the necessary investigations. Work performed under Contract No. 573 XXSA 001, Work Authorization No. 57311 SA 001, included a mechanical grave search, excavation and removal of burial remains, on-site analysis, and reburial. These tasks were accomplished between November 18 and 21, 2003. No collections were made. Gradall scraping and subsequent hand excavations exhumed the remains of four individuals in three separate graves. Analysis of these remains, as well as historical documentation, identifies these people as: Burial 1 Unidentified adult, probably female, age 30 to 40 years. Burial 2 Unidentified, probably adult, indeterminate sex and age. Burial 3 Disarticulated remains of Oscar Abstein, a 38 -year old male, and an <b>unidentified</b> <b>child</b> of indeterminate sex.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{identification}} during adolescence is very important, because with such identification can strengthen its growth and I do {{play a role}} in adolescent identity formation. In the achievement of self-identity, the role of parents is very important because parents are the primary identification figure and the strongest for children. Nowadays many divorces occur that cause the number of children raised by single parents. Parental divorce or death of a parent causes a child loses a figure of identification. Figure identification is very important for youth development because the identification of the juvenile to perform the role according to gender and society demands. With the loss of one figure of identification, of course teenagers will experience some problems in carrying out its role The purpose of this research is to know how to identify the teen who was raised by single parents and obstacles encountered during the identification process. This research is qualitative. This research was conducted on September 12 to October 10, 2006 and November 6 to 27, 2006. in Malang and Batu with the subject as much as 4 people. Methods of data collection in this research is interview and observation. Data analysis used descriptive qualitative The results showed that there are differences experienced by each subject in terms of causes of the subjects raised by single parents. In subjects who cared for by family single parent due to divorce, there is a tendency of children do not have the ideal figure of identification for the trust to parents, especially those who have disappeared. In contrast to the family of the subject was raised by a single parent due to death of one parent, there is a tendency for the <b>unidentified</b> <b>child</b> with parents who nurture him or his closest relatives are considered ideal to be identified. Young women who cared for by her father and teenage son who was raised by mothers tend to have much difficulty in performing the role of both sexes mupun accordance with the demands of society. This is because there is no substitute figure for the subject. While the young man who was raised by her father and teenage daughter who was raised by mothers have no difficulty in carrying out his role because he has a figure that can serve as an example in doing the role according to gender and society demands...|$|E
