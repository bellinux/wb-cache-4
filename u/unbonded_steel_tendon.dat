40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} post-tensioned timber frames for multi-storey timber buildings. Post-tensioned timber beams and frames give opportunities for much greater use of timber and engineered wood products in large buildings, using innovative technologies for creating high quality buildings with large open spaces, excellent living and working environments, and resistance to hazards including earthquakes, fires, and extreme weather events. Post-tensioned timber building systems are being developed at the University of Canterbury {{in collaboration with the}} Structural Timber Innovation Company Ltd (STIC) funded by Australian and New Zealand industries, and the New Zealand government. The post-tensioned structural system uses <b>unbonded</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tendons</b> in ducts in large timber box beams. In moment-resisting timber frames, the horizontal <b>steel</b> <b>tendons</b> also pass through the columns, providing moment resistance. Added advantages for extreme loading are ductility, and total re-centring of the building after an earthquake. The system can also be used with draped tendons in long span beams over a number of internal supports, or with vertical post-tensioning in columns or solid timber shear walls with vertical ducts for the tendons. The post-tensioning also provides for rapid erection, and simple and economical connections between the large timber elements. This paper gives details of experimental testing and the design of prototype buildings, describing other features such as high fire resistance, thermal and acoustic performance, and low carbon footprint...|$|R
40|$|Continuous beams are {{preferred}} to simply supported beams because of economy, fewer expansion / contraction joints and possible benefits from moment redistribution. In {{the design of}} unbonded partially prestressed concrete (UPPC) continuous beams, {{it is necessary to}} estimate their deflections under service loads in order to satisfy the requirements of serviceability limit state. A method is developed to convert the cross sectional area of unbonded prestressed tendons to the equivalent cross sectional area of non-prestressed steel. Then the moment of inertia of cracked section as well as Branson’s effective moment of inertia in a UPPC continuous beam can be easily determined. The computed deflections are compared with some available experimental results, including beams with external <b>unbonded</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tendons</b> and those with external unbonded aramid fibre reinforced polymer tendons. The proposed method gives satisfactory predictions of deflection till the yielding of non-prestressed steel. Another equation for moment of inertia of cracked section, which was originally suggested by the PCI design handbook for bonded partially prestressed concrete beams, is also evaluated in the study. In most cases the PCI equation can also give satisfactory results but in some cases its discrepancy of deflections is larger than that of the proposed method.

40|$|Post-tensioned timber {{buildings}} utilise a {{new construction}} technique developed largely {{as part of}} research undertaken at the University of Canterbury. Timber buildings are constructed using an engineered timber product, such as laminated veneer lumber (LVL), and then stressed with post-tensioned <b>unbonded</b> high-strength <b>steel</b> <b>tendons.</b> The tendons apply a compressive stress to timber members to create a ductile moment resisting connection between adjacent timber members. The major benefit of post-tensioned timber buildings is a significantly improved structural performance. As timber is a combustible material there is a perceived high fire risk in timber buildings. While timber buildings can be designed to perform very well in fire, a design guide for the fire safety design of post-tensioned timber buildings has not been previously developed. Furthermore, previous {{research has found that}} post-tensioned timber box beams may be susceptible to shear failure in fire conditions. This research investigated the fire performance of post-tensioned timber buildings. A design strategy for the fire performance of post-tensioned timber buildings was developed in conjunction with a simplified calculation method for determining the fire resistance of post-tensioned timber structural members. The fire performance and failure behaviour of post-tensioned timber box beam was also specifically investigated, with special focus given to the shear performance of box beams. A full scale furnace test of a LVL post-tensioned LVL box beam was conducted at the Building Research Association of New Zealand (BRANZ). Four further full scale tests of LVL box beams were conducted at ambient temperature at the University of Canterbury structural laboratory. Through this research two distinct strategies for the fire design of post-tensioned timber structures were developed. The first strategy is to rely on the residual timber of the members only. The second strategy considers specific fire protection of the post-tensioning system, which can then be used to contribute to the fire resistance of the member. The results of the full scale tests showed good agreement with the proposed the simplified calculation method. It was also determined that shear failure {{does not need to be}} specifically considered other than performing strength checks as for other design actions...|$|R

40|$|Application of Fiber Reinforced Plastic (FRP) in the {{construction}} industry is desired due to its advanced properties such as high resistance to corrosion, high tensile strength and low density. Many researchers have conducted various investigations on application of FRP for retrofitting, reinforcing and prestressing of concrete structures. As tendons work at high stress levels, fatigue will be a detrimental factor influencing their performance. This project was aimed at investigating the fatigue behavior of Glass Fiber Reinforced Plastic (GFRP) tendon prestressed concrete beams. The research included three parts, bond strength, prestress loss and fatigue behavior of prestressed beams. In the first part, the bonding properties between GFRP tendon and concrete were studied. Circular specimens with GFRP rods embedded in center of cement mortar discs were prepared and tested to determine the bond performance of GFRP tendon. The second part was to study the prestress loss of GFRP when used as prestressing tendon. It is generally assumed that prestress loss of GFRP tendon would be smaller than that of steel due to its lower stiffness. Beams with GFRP rod as prestress tendon were made and tested to verify this assumption. The last part was to investigate the fatigue behavior of GFRP tendon prestressed beams by comparing with <b>steel</b> <b>tendon</b> prestressed beams. Beams prestressed by GFRP <b>tendon</b> and <b>steel</b> <b>tendon</b> were prepared and tested at various loading levels for comparison. Test results showed that surface condition has great influence on bond strength while mortar composition only has limited effect. Comparing with smooth surface steel rod, smooth surface GFRP rod possessed slightly smaller bond strength. While sand blasted rough surface GFRP had great improvement for about 100 % increase in bond strength. However, reinforcement was required to be added in the rough surface GFRP specimens to prevent the formation of radial cracks during the push-out test. Two beams prestressed with rough surface GFRP tendon and smooth surface <b>steel</b> <b>tendon</b> respectively were monitored for prestress loss. The results showed that the rough surface GFRP tendon had a slightly higher strain loss than the smooth surface <b>steel</b> <b>tendon.</b> However, with a much lower Young’s modulus, in the scale of about one fourth of the <b>steel</b> <b>tendon,</b> the rough surface GFRP tendon had only about one fourth of prestress loss of <b>steel</b> <b>tendon.</b> Fatigue behaviors of GFRP <b>tendon</b> and <b>steel</b> <b>tendon</b> prestressed beams are similar, especially in lower loading levels. Fatigue tests showed that the GFRP tendon prestressed beams had a lower fatigue strength than <b>steel</b> <b>tendon</b> prestressed beams. The GFRP <b>tendon</b> and <b>steel</b> <b>tendon</b> prestressed beams failed quickly when loaded at 60 % and 80 % of their ultimate strength respectively.

However, fire may cause irrecoverable damages to such slabs including rupture of prestressing <b>steel</b> <b>tendons,</b> concrete spalling, large downward deflection and even progressive collapse. Therefore, thorough investigations of the slabs under fire condition are desirable to formulate performance-based fire resistance design guidance. Numerical modelling of PT {{concrete slabs}} with unbonded tendons under fire condition was carried out based on available test results in the literature. Finite element (FE) models were established employing the commercial package ABAQUS. Results from the preliminary study achieved acceptable agreement with the test results. Parametric study was further conducted for better understanding of the structural responses and failure modes of the slabs. The behaviour of prestressing <b>steel</b> <b>tendons</b> at elevated temperature was then investigated with emphasis on thermal creep, where a three-dimensional (3 D) model incorporating Harmathy’s thermal creep model was proposed and verified. As there was limited data of thermal creep, thermal creep tests of prestressing steel to GB/T 55224 and BS 5896 were conducted, from which parameters of Harmathy’s creep model were obtained. Making use of the parameters obtained and the proposed 3 D model, the thermal relaxation of prestressing <b>steel</b> <b>tendons</b> could be accurately predicted as compared with the results of thermal relaxation tests of the both types of prestressing steel conducted in the present study. The proposed 3 D model for prestressing steel was further incorporated into the FE models of PT concrete slabs to investigate the effects of thermal creep of prestressing <b>steel</b> <b>tendons</b> on the structural responses of the slabs. Numerical results show that thermal creep has slight effect on the downward deflections of slabs, but has obvious effect on the tendon stresses. Moreover, the transient creep strain of concrete was further incorporated into the FE models of PT concrete slabs, and the results showed that the transient creep strain had obvious effect on the downward deflections of slabs, and hence the transient creep strain should not be ignored. Tests and numerical modelling of PT two-way slabs with high-strength self-compacting concrete and unbonded tendons under ISO 834 standard fire condition were conducted. Useful results were obtained from four fire tests including the vertical and horizontal deflections, crack patterns, possible tensile membrane action and explosive concrete spalling. Based on the tests, numerical modelling was further improved in consideration of tendon distributions, levels of prestressing and areas exposed to fire, where the thermal creep of prestressing steel and the transient creep strain of concrete were explicitly considered. Better understanding of the structural responses and failure modes was obtained. The results obtained were then examined for more insight into the structural fire performance of PT concrete slabs and formulation of performance-based fire resistance design guidance. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

Concrete members are modelled by beamcolumn elements while tendons are modelled by truss elements with nodes connected to the beam axis by perpendicular rigid arms. Finally, the individual and combined effects of concrete creep, concrete shrinkage and cable relaxation on the long-term behaviour of a prestressed concrete frame are studied.

To replace the <b>steel</b> <b>tendons</b> with non-corrosive and low weight FRPs (Fiber Reinforced Polymers), the different mechanical {{interactions between the}} steel and FRPs call for further development of the anchorage. In this paper, we derive and examine an analytical model for the internal stresses and strains within the anchorage for a prescribed presetting distance. This model {{is derived from the}} theory of thick walled cylinders under the assumptions regarding plane stress and axial symmetry. We simplify the resulting system of ten nonlinear equations and derive a method for solving them numerically. A comparison of plotted results for three different angles on the wedge's outer surface and six different presetting distances follows. These results are also compared to both axi-symmetric and 3 D FE (Finite Element) models. Analytical and FE axi-symmetric models show good correspondence, though compared to the 3 D FE model, they show a clear difference in the predicted radial stress distribution on the FRP. Thus, the derived analytical model can be a useful and fasteralternative to FE modeling of axi-symmetric anchorages. However, the model is of more restricted value and should be complemented by, for example, 3 D FE models for other designs.

The use of unbonded post-tensioned reinforcing allows for unique and cost-effective design and construction, including thinner concrete sections, longer spans between supports, stiffer walls to resist lateral loads, and stiffer foundations to resist the effects of shrinking and swelling soils. Unbonded post-tensioned reinforcing is accom-plished by placing high-strength <b>steel</b> <b>tendons</b> or bars into a sheathing or duct, allowing it to move as the tensioning force is applied after the concrete cures. The steel elongates as it is tensioned, and i...|$|R
40|$|Prestress {{forces are}} often applied to {{concrete}} structures to create compressive stresses in regions {{that will be}} subjected to superposed tension stresses due to applied service loads. Often these prestress forces are applied using <b>steel</b> <b>tendons</b> that are imbedded in the structure and stressed in tension. The tendons react against the structure and thus subject the concrete to compression. The structure may be fully-pre-stressed, so that the precompressed regions remain in compression under applied service loads, or partially-prestressed so that the precompressed regions may experience tension stress under applied service loads. Additional details of the mechanics of pre-stressed concrete members {{can be found in}} many textbooks (e. g. Reference [1]) ...|$|R
40|$|In view of {{long term}} {{maintenance}} of its infrastructure facilities the Dutch Highway Administration (Rijkswaterstaat) has repaired over 1. 500 heads of prestressed beams and {{provided them with}} cathodic protection (CP). The heads of these beams showed moderate to severe damage due to rein forcement corrosion caused by the penetration of chiorides from leakingjoints, which required adequate intervention on the short term. By means of cathodic protection the corrosion process has been halted, so {{that the risk of}} further degradation of the beams and possible failure of the pre-stressing <b>steel</b> <b>tendons</b> has been minimized. In addition, the concrete repairs in the chioride contaminated parts of the beams will be durable...|$|R
50|$|In some cases, {{the lateral}} support {{which can be}} {{provided}} by the shoring wall alone is insufficient to resist the planned lateral loads; in this case additional support is provided by walers or tie-backs. Walers are structural elements which connect across the excavation so that the loads from the soil {{on either side of}} the excavation are used to resist each other, or which transfer horizontal loads from the shoring wall to the base of the excavation. Tie-backs are <b>steel</b> <b>tendons</b> drilled into the face of the wall which extend beyond the soil which is applying pressure to the wall, to provide additional lateral resistance to the wall.|$|R
