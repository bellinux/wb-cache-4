40|$|The off-net-cost pricing {{principle}} {{argues that}} under {{a broad range}} of environments a positive “access ” charge paid by originating networks to interconnected terminating networks would cause networks to set on-net <b>usage</b> <b>charges</b> equal to off-net rates, and that these charges would fully reflect the access charge. However, other results in the literature provide reasonable conditions under which on-net <b>usage</b> <b>charges</b> will not reflect access charges, but would be set to induce the social surplus maximizing level of on-net usage. This paper harmonizes these two apparently opposing results by showing that retail <b>usage</b> <b>charges</b> depend on two effects. One is a rent seeking effect on the part of networks and the other is an efficient utilization effect. In models in which the rent seeking effect is more important, on-net <b>usage</b> <b>charges</b> will tend to equal their off-net <b>usage</b> <b>charges</b> and incorporate the access charge. In models in which the efficient utilization effect matters more, off-net <b>usage</b> <b>charges</b> will reflect access <b>charges,</b> but onnet <b>usage</b> <b>charges</b> will not be affected by the level of access charges, but instead will tend to be set at the levels that promote efficient on-net utilization.

40|$|There are now {{available}} {{a number of new}} subscription services that comprise a dual pricing system of a monthly access fee (rental) and a per-minute <b>usage</b> <b>charge.</b> Examples include cellular phones, the Internet, and pay TV. The usage and retention of such services depend on the absolute and relative prices of this dual system. For instance, a moderate access fee but a low-usage charge might initially appeal to customers, but later a low-usage customer might find the monthly fee unjustified and thereby relinquish the service. Providers of such services, therefore, usually offer several pricing packages to cater to differing customer needs. The {{purpose of this study is}} to derive a revenue-maximizing strategy for subscription services, that is, the combination of access and usage price that maximizes revenue over a specified time period. An additional objective is to determine access and usage price elasticities because they have historically played an important role in theoretical pricing models. The application area is the cellular phone market, but for a new rather than an existing product. To help gauge the likely usage rates and customer retention, a field experiment is conducted in which several alternative price combinations are used. Specifically, a sample of potential residential customers (most of whom did not have an existing cell phone) were divided into four treatment groups. The first group were not charged an access fee but did have to pay a small per-minute <b>usage</b> <b>charge.</b> The second group also paid a small <b>usage</b> <b>charge</b> but in addition had three access price increases over the duration of the trial. The third group paid no access fee but had <b>usage</b> <b>charge</b> increases, while the fourth group had both access fee and <b>usage</b> <b>charge</b> increases. Usage levels for each respondent are recorded, as is their month of dropout if they discontinue the service. An initial examination of the data shows that higher access fees result in higher customer attrition, and higher usage cost results in lower usage. Furthermore, usage and retention are related in that declining usage levels over time often signal impending customer attrition. Hence, two phenomena need to be modeled: usage of the service and customer retention conditional on usage. Some seasonal effects are also observed and are allowed for in the model. Modeling customer attrition simultaneously with usage is important because ignoring customer attrition will likely result in an underestimate of price sensitivity. This results from a censoring effect, whereby respondents who remain in the trial tend to be wealthier, and hence, less price sensitive. Given the known problems of ignoring customer attrition, we develop a theoretical model of usage, which explicitly incorporates attrition by extending a time-series model introduced by Hausman and Wise (1979). We make two extensions of the Hausman and Wise model. The first is to generalize it from two to many time periods and the second is to allow for respondent heterogeneity by incorporating latent classes. We fit the model by maximum likelihood and find that a two-segment model is best. In addition, we examine the predictive validity of our model and find it to be reasonably good. In general, the results show that access and usage prices have different relative effects on demand and retention. There are five key results. First, access price has some effect on usage but a much stronger effect on retention. Second, usage price has a strong effect on usage and a moderate effect on retention, in that if usage price increases so much that usage declines, then lower usage levels results in higher attrition. Third, access price elasticity is about half that of usage price, with both elasticities generally being much smaller than 1, indicating relative inelasticity for this particular service. Fourth, customer attrition rate (churn) is much more sensitive to access than usage price and, last, if just observed usage is examined and customer attrition is ignored, then price sensitivity is very likely to be substantially underestimated (on the order of 45 % in our case). Finally, when developing the revenue-maximizing price combination we allow for the cost of customer acquisition by using some typical advertising-to-sales ratios for the telecommunications industry. We find that the revenue maximizing price is $ 27. 70 per month for the access fee and $ 0. 81 per minute for the airtime charge. These values are in line with current access fees and usage costs in the given market. Attrition, Field Experiment, Pricing, Price Elasticity, Subscription, Telecommunications...|$|E
40|$|Half of the world's population, {{production}} and consumption activities are concentrated in the coastal zone which accounts for only 10 % of all land area. High density population areas have a deficit of space. Coastal human settlements can exploit their position by reclaiming tidal and shallow sea areas through sea reclamation. Sea reclamation by the coast usually means that the sea is filled with land to create more useful land area. Sea reclamation, however, results in heavy losses to ecosystems of the immediate coastal environment. The coastal ecosystems functions such as storing and cycling nutrients, filtering pollutants from inland freshwater systems, protecting shorelines from erosion and storms, regulating global hydrology and climate, accepting and assimilating waste and providing food and materials can be destroyed by the sea reclamation. Imposing <b>usage</b> <b>charge</b> on sea reclamation is an effective economic incentive for regulating the sea reclamation. The value of filled seas as production factors and ecological damage of sea reclamation must {{be integrated into the}} decision-making to ensure the sustainable use of marine resources. In our paper, we establish ecological-economic models to estimate the value of marine space as production factors and to assess the ecological damage of sea reclamation to provide sound basis for the policy making about regulating the sea reclamation. We applied the developed model in Xiamen and found that the values of filled seas for industrial zone and for commercial use were 48. 82 yuan/m(2) and 1251. 4 - 1572. 04 yuan/m(2); the value of ecological damage of sea reclamation was 279 yuan/m(2).
