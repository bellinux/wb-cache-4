40|$|In 2014, a {{landslide}} in a steep slope beneath an apartment block in Refne {{in the city}} of Halden, Norway led to the evacuation of over 60 residents from their homes. The landslide is assumed to have been triggered by unusually high levels of rainfall over the preceding months, leading to accumulative long-term rainfall not previously seen in the lifetime of the block. Raised groundwater level and increased pore water in the saturated and unsaturated (vadose) zones are assumed to have contributed to reduced stability of the slope. An initial risk assessment was performed to aid communication with local authorities and stakeholders and to clarify necessary actions. Following the evaluation of potential scenarios affecting the structural integrity of the pile foundations, the risk to residents was found to be unacceptable, and evacuation was therefore maintained. In particular, the potential development of a quick clay slide would have had catastrophic consequences. In order to improve the basis for further risk analyses and allow the design of stabilising measures, geotechnical site investigations (SI) were undertaken. Following the SI results and the completion of stabilising measures, an <b>updated</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> was issued. This concluded a reduced level of risk for all landslide scenarios previously evaluated, and that the risk to residents was adequately reduced. This paper shows how the visualization of risk using diagrams for risk analysis enabled communication and understanding between the geotechnical and structural engineers, police, local authorities and other stakeholders throughout the project, and formed the basis for decisions regarding evacuations and necessary mitigation measures. Engineering judgment is essential when reviewing risks in any natural hazard situation. Graphical risk analysis tools allow experience to be quantified and communicated to both experts and laymen alike so that operational decisions regarding public safety can be taken...|$|E
40|$|Since the ?trends in risk level? project {{first was}} started, the weights used to {{estimate}} the risk level on the Norwegian Continental Shelf has more or less been the same; five sets of generic weights, one {{for each type of}} facility, and not facility specific and time dependent. The aim of this master thesis has been to develop a new weight estimation model. The new model estimates time dependent and facility specific weights, based on risk analyses and observed barrier functions? performances. These weights are combined with occurrences of major accident precursors for each facility and then summed up for the entire Norwegian Continental Shelf. This estimates one risk indicator, combining both types of major accident related data reported in the ?trends in risk level? project. The developed model consists of two methods; method 1 and method 2. Both methods use the facility?s QRA and reported barrier functions? performances when estimating new weights. There are however some differences between the two methods. o	Method 1 reproduces parts of the risk analysis, but instead of using assumed barrier functions? performances, observed performance is used. Based on the <b>updated</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis,</b> weights are estimated. o	Method 2 adjusts the risk estimated by the original risk analysis by correction factors based on deviations between the observed barrier functions? performances and benchmark values. Both methods estimate facility specific weights based on barrier functions? performances. Method 1 gives more correct weights, is more time-consuming and requires more information from the available data. Method 2 will be less specific to the facility, as it uses general calibration factors established based on other facilities. The test cases show that method 1 will give good weight estimates and that weights can be estimated by method 2. It can also be seen that the new weight estimates are significantly different from the generic weights and that the estimated weights changes from year to year depending on barrier functions? performances. </p...|$|E

40|$|Recent major {{accidents}} in the offshore {{oil and gas}} (O&G) industry have showed inadequate assessment of system risk and demonstrated {{the need to improve}} <b>risk</b> <b>analysis.</b> While direct causes often differ, the failure to <b>update</b> <b>risk</b> evaluation on the basis of system changes/modifications has been a recurring problem. Risk is traditionally defined as a measure of the accident likelihood and the magnitude of loss, usually assessed as damage to people, to the environment, and/or economic loss. Recent revisions of such definition include also aspects of uncertainty. However, Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) in the offshore O&G industry is based on consolidated procedures and methods, where periodic evaluation and <b>update</b> of <b>risk</b> is not commonly carried out. Several methodologies were recently developed for dynamic <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> of the offshore O&G industry. Dynamic fault trees, Markov chain models for the lifecycle analysis, and Weibull failure analysis may be used for dynamic frequency evaluation and <b>risk</b> assessment <b>update.</b> Moreover, dynamic <b>risk</b> assessment methods were developed in order to evaluate the <b>risk</b> by <b>updating</b> initial failure probabilities of events (causes) and safety barriers as new information are made available. However, the mentioned techniques are not widely applied in the common O&G offshore practice due to several reasons, among which their complexity has a primary role. More intuitive approaches focusing on a selected number of critical factors have also been suggested, such as the Risk Barometer or the TEC 2 O. Such techniques are based on the evaluation of technical, operational and organizational factors. The methodology allows supporting periodic update of QRA by collecting and aggregating a set of indicators. However, their effectiveness relies on continuous monitoring activity and realtime data capturing. For this reason, this contribution focuses on the coupling of such methods with sensors of different nature located in or around and offshore O&G system. The inheritance from the Centre for Integrated Operations in the Petroleum Industries represents the basis of such study. Such approach may be beneficial for several cases in which (quasi) real-time risk evaluation may support critical operations. Two representative cases have been described: i) erosion and corrosion issues due to sand production; and ii) oil production in environmental sensitive areas. In both the cases, dynamic <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> may employ real-time data provided by sand, corrosion and leak detectors. A simulation of dynamic <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> has demonstrated how the variation of such data can affect the overall risk picture. In fact, this risk assessment approach has not only the capability to continuously iterate and outline improved system risk pictures, but it can also compare its results with sensor-measured data and allow for calibration. This can potentially guarantee progressive improvement of the method reliability for appropriate support to safety-critical decisions...|$|R
