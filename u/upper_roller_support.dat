50|$|A simple Van de Graaff {{generator}} {{consists of}} a belt of rubber (or a similar flexible dielectric material) moving over two rollers of differing material, {{one of which is}} surrounded by a hollow metal sphere. Two electrodes, (2) and (7), in the form of comb-shaped rows of sharp metal points, are positioned {{near the bottom of the}} lower roller and inside the sphere, over the <b>upper</b> <b>roller.</b> Comb (2) is connected to the sphere, and comb (7) to ground. The method of charging is based on the triboelectric effect, such that simple contact of dissimilar materials causes the transfer of some electrons from one material to the other. For example (see the diagram), the rubber of the belt will become negatively charged while the acrylic glass of the <b>upper</b> <b>roller</b> will become positively charged. The belt carries away negative charge on its inner surface while the <b>upper</b> <b>roller</b> accumulates positive charge. Next, the strong electric field surrounding the positive <b>upper</b> <b>roller</b> (3) induces a very high electric field near the points of the nearby comb (2). At the points, the field becomes strong enough to ionize air molecules, and the electrons are attracted to the outside of the belt while positive ions go to the comb. At the comb (2) they are neutralized by electrons that were on the comb, thus leaving the comb and the attached outer shell (1) with fewer net electrons. By the principle illustrated in the Faraday ice pail experiment, i.e. by Gauss's law, the excess positive charge is accumulated on the outer surface of the outer shell (1), leaving no field inside the shell. Electrostatic induction by this method continues, building up very large amounts of charge on the shell.|$|R

The development of the CMA inside the floor is strictly associated with the horizontal movement of the slab end under the vertical loading. Therefore, the simply supported PSSDB floor was tested under vertical uniformly distributed load. Study of results revealed that the recorded horizontal movement at the <b>roller</b> <b>support</b> of the slab is 0. 81 mm in the pin- <b>roller</b> <b>supported</b> case.

40|$|Purpose. The {{main purpose}} of {{experimental}} studies is to establish {{the adequacy of the}} developed mathematical models of machine fluctuations and the actual parameters of machine vibration. Almost all casting machines for the production of mill rolls have a unique design and performances. The additional aim of this work is to compare the vibration level of the casting machine with the requirements of the current vibration standards for new technological machines. Frequency analysis of the oscillations allows establishing defects in workmanship, errors of rotating parts installation and their influence on the dynamics of the machine. Methodology. Measurement of vibration parameters was performed on the moving parts of roller bearings of the machine. To measure the amplitudes of accelerations in three mutually perpendicular directions piezoelectric sensors with magnetic mount were used. Electrical signals from the sensors were recorded on magnetic tape. Further analysis of the oscillations was carried out and visualized using specialized frequency analyzer. The frequency analyzer implements the algorithm of fast Fourier transformation and/or integration of sensor input signal. After the first integration the data for plotting the vibration velocity spectrogram were obtained {{and as a result of}} the second integration there are the data of vibration displacements spectrogram of the machine supports. Findings. The results of experimental studies of centrifugal casting machine vibrations for the production of two-layer rolls were presented. There were obtained and analyzed the spectrograms of accelerations, velocities and displacements of moving parts of the <b>upper</b> and lower <b>roller</b> <b>supports.</b> The work of the machine is associated with the calculated values passing of critical frequencies and the short-term development of resonance oscillations of the rotor and roller bearings. Originality. For the first time the author obtained the frequency spectra of vibration of an industrial sample of a casting machine. The oscillations with frequencies that differ from the basic rotor frequency were detected. Practical value. Based on the results of the experiment, the actual vibration parameters of the machine in steady state when testing without die-casting the metal were determined. The adequacy of mathematical models of the dynamics of the machine and its industrial model was established. Using the method of one tone the coefficients of vibration velocity distortion of the rotor harmonic, indicating the nonlinear transformations in the system "rotor - bearings" were obtained. It was experimentally established that the vibration parameters of the machine are within the acceptable ranges, regulated by standards for vibroactive machines...|$|R

40|$|An {{emergency}} {{situation in a}} continuous transport system is an undesirable phenomenon during which the continuity of production or technological processes is seriously endangered. This situation can be brought about by various factors. In technological equipment of environmental continuous belt conveyor systems and pipe conveyors various adverse critical conditions may arise, which may result {{in the creation of}} an {{emergency situation}}. In particular, both conveyor and <b>supporting</b> <b>rollers</b> being the most significant components of the conveyor belt can substantially contribute to the onset of an emergency situation. Any damage to them can lead to a reduction or a complete standstill of the continuous transport process, which impedes upon the subsequent production operations. This contribution describes the possibility of the measurement and assessment of normal contact forces, which are applied by the conveyor belt to the <b>supporting</b> <b>rollers</b> on the hexagonal idler <b>roller</b> <b>support</b> of the pipe conveyors.

40|$|Free undamped {{in-plane}} vibrations of shear undeformable beams {{around their}} highly buckled configurations are investigated neglecting rotary inertia effects. The beams are inertially nonuniform since a lumped mass is rigidly clamped along the span. Two mechanical models are considered {{depending on the}} boundary conditions in the post-buckling phases. First, the beam is considered inextensible because it is hinged {{at one end and}} is acted upon by an axial compressive force on the other end, a <b>roller</b> <b>support,</b> both in the buckling and post-buckling phases. In the second model, the beam is extensible in the post-buckling phase because the <b>roller</b> <b>support</b> boundary is changed into a fixed hinged end. Free undamped vibrations are governed, in the first case, by a homogeneous integral-partial-differential equation and, in the second case. by two coupled partial-differential equations with variable coefficients. The solutions of the associated eigenvalue problems are found employing two approaches: a semi-analytical method based on Galerkin discretization and a finite element method. A close agreement in the outcomes is found.

40|$|The project {{which is}} {{presented}} in this report {{is focused on the}} positioning of the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> connected to the Kiln in one of the pelletizing plants in Kiruna at LKAB. Kiln is a rotating oven where the pellets are sintered, {{which is one of the}} steps in the pelletizing process. The <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> are used to position Kiln in an axial or vertical direction, by either skewing the rollers or positioning the whole center of the rollers towards or away from the Kiln. The plan for this project is to be used as a preparatory work for a construction of an atomized system for adjustment of the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> for Kiln at LKAB in Kiruna. An atomized adjustment system can possibly simplify the procedure of Kiln positioning, increase the lifespan of the system and increase the reliability of the whole system. This report can also lead to improvements by being used as a support during positioning of <b>support</b> <b>rollers.</b> A <b>support</b> system for Kiln positioning can contribute to avoid production disturbances. Product disturbances can occur because of damaged components such as damaged support wheels or parts of the Kiln driveline. Less production disturbances increases the availability of the Grate-Kiln plant and thereby increases the profitability for LKAB. The aim of this project has been to develop a calculation model which can show the reactions of Kiln when the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> are adjusted. The assignment was also to include the heating and cooling of Kiln and to have considerations regarding the gear contact in the driveline. One part of the assignment was also to document the damages that can occur because of inaccurate positioning of the <b>support</b> <b>rollers.</b> The final step in this project was to propose optimized positions for the <b>support</b> <b>rollers.</b> This project is the final assignment before examination from the M. Sc Student in Mechanical Engineering program at the University of Technology in Luleå LTU in Sweden. The main part of this project has been to develop a calculation model. The calculation model is built in a Matlab script. In this Matlab script there are essentially six parts of the script that can be varied, and these parts are:- The temperatures in the system- The dimensions of components- The load, with or without pellets- The positioning of the pellets in the Kiln - The skewing of the support rollers- The positioning of the center of the support rollersWhen these parameters are varied a result for over 170 parameters can be collected. The calculation model is mainly focused on how the forces in the system reacts when the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> are adjusted and also how the Kiln reacts to thermal expansion and contraction. It is essentially the center positioning of the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> which is analyzed. The calculations of the forces which occur because of the skewing of the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> was too complicated and time consuming to be able to be finished during this project. The calculations regarding the skewing of the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> has been started and future work has been recommended. The calculation model, which is one of the results of this project has been used to analyze the reactions from positioning the <b>support</b> <b>rollers.</b> By examine how great the height differences are for the Kiln, a maximum center positioning of the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> has been recommended. This recommended maximum positioning is to protect any damages to the gear contact in the drive line. The thermal effects does not have a major impact on the forces in the system. Height differences that occur during heating and cooling of the Kiln has been noted up to about 9 mm. There is no great impact on the forces in the system during the interval which the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> can be adjusted without exceeding the maximum height differences.

40|$|The natural {{frequencies}} and mode shapes of planar shear undeformable beams around their curved prestressed post-buckling configurations are investigated. Two mechanical models are considered {{depending on the}} assumed boundary conditions in the buckling and post-buckling phases. Namely, with the first model, the beam is considered inextensible because it is hinged {{at one end and}} is acted upon by an axial compressive force on the other end, a <b>roller</b> <b>support.</b> In the second case, the beam is assumed inextensible in the buckling phase (same boundary conditions as above), however, it is considered extensible in the subsequent post-buckling phase because the <b>roller</b> <b>support</b> is changed into a hinged end. The post-buckling solution is obtained with three approaches: asymptotic, numerical via evaluation of an elliptic integral, and numerical via finite-element formulation (FEM). Due to the non-constant curvature, the equations of motion governing linear vibrations around the post-buckling configuration are linear partial-differential equations with non-constant coefficients and the solutions for the frequencies and mode shapes are found employing two approximate approaches: a fully numerical FEM approach and a semi-analytical method based on a weak formulation (Galerkin method) implemented in an in-house built code. The main results are compared and a close agreement in the outcomes is found. The leading mechanical differences in the linear normal modes of the two prestressed elastica arch models and their potential influence on nonlinear vibrations are discussed.
