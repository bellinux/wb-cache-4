5|$|Although American {{officials}} {{at the highest levels}} of the intelligence community (e.g. CIA Director William Colby) were certain that the South Vietnamese government would collapse, everyone in the U.S. government <b>underestimated</b> <b>the</b> speed of the North Vietnamese advance during the 1975 Spring Offensive and how quickly South Vietnam's Army would collapse.|$|E
5|$|During late 1944 {{and early}} 1945 the Australian Army {{suffered}} from a shortage of shipping, leading to delays in moving heavy equipment and small watercraft from Australia to operational areas in the South West Pacific. While several British and United States vessels were eventually made available in mid-1945, the Australian Army's chief engineer, Major General Clive Steele, chose to design and build a heavy lift ship for the Army. Steele personally designed the ship, which was intended to support amphibious operations and transport supplies. He deliberately <b>underestimated</b> <b>the</b> project's cost {{in order to gain}} approval for the ship's design and construction.|$|E
5|$|Early {{forecasts}} <b>underestimated</b> <b>the</b> {{peak intensity}} of Pauline by 65mph (105km/h). On October 7, about 41hours before landfall, {{the government of}} Mexico issued a hurricane warning from Tapachula in Chiapas to Punta Maldonado in Guerrero. Shortly after Pauline made landfall, the warning was extended northwestward to Manzanillo, Colima, and later to Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco. Pauline's turn to the west-northwest near landfall was unexpected, resulting in hurricane conditions {{with only a few}} hours notice in some areas.|$|E

When the true size of the fleets became apparent, Graves assumed that de Grasse and Barras had already joined forces, and prepared for battle; he directed his line toward the bay's mouth, assisted by winds from the north-northeast.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} of the metric system into France in 1795 was done on a district by district basis with Paris being the first district, but by modern standards the transition was poorly managed. Although thousands of pamphlets were distributed, the Agency of Weights and Measures who oversaw the introduction <b>underestimated</b> <b>the</b> work involved. Paris alone needed 500,000 metre sticks, yet {{one month after the}} metre became the sole legal unit of measure, they only had 25,000 in store. This, combined with other excesses of the Revolution and the high level of illiteracy made the metric system unpopular.|$|E

5|$|The storyline {{was written}} by former Star Trek writer D.C. Fontana, while the script was created by John Meredyth Lucas.

Despite this promotion, the game was cancelled with estimates placing it at only 5% completion. The cast of The Original Series had already recorded their voices.

5|$|Glee {{debuted in}} America on the Fox network on May19, 2009.

In the week prior to the broadcast of the pilot episode, Murphy stated that seven different companies had bid on {{the rights to the}} series' first soundtrack. The contenders were narrowed down to four labels, with Fox ultimately signing a deal with Columbia Records as a result of chairman Rob Stringer's belief that Glee would be a success. Stringer appreciated the series' use of both classic and contemporary pop music. He suggested that other record labels <b>underestimated</b> <b>the</b> potential of Glee musical releases as they are all cover versions.|$|E

5|$|In 1832 {{engineer}} James Green advised on {{extending the}} system, and suggested a line with three inclined planes to reach Cwmmawr, further up the Gwendraeth Valley. Although Green had experience with inclined planes on other canals, he <b>underestimated</b> <b>the</b> cost {{and could not}} complete the work. He was sacked in 1836, but the canal company finished the new route the following year. The canal was moderately successful, and shareholders received dividends from 1858. In 1865 the company {{changed its name to}} become the Kidwelly and Burry Port Railway, amalgamated with the company running Burry Port in the following year, and the canal became the Burry Port and Gwendraeth Valley Railway in 1869.|$|E
5|$|In 855, Michael III turned {{fifteen and}} thus came {{nominally}} of age. His mother and Theoktistos both <b>underestimated</b> <b>the</b> young emperor's desire to free himself from their custodianship, and antagonized him further when they arranged a bride show and selected Eudokia Dekapolitissa as his bride, disregarding Michael's attachment to his mistress, Eudokia Ingerina. Theodora's brother Bardas {{was able to}} use Michael's resentment for the high-handed manner in which he was treated and began to turn him against the regency. With Michael's backing, Bardas was allowed to return to the capital, and on 20 November 855, Theoktistos was murdered. Theodora was compelled to retire to a monastery a few months later, bringing the regency officially to an end.|$|E
5|$|In Asia Minor, Conrad {{decided not}} {{to wait for the}} French, and marched towards Iconium, capital of the Seljuq Sultanate of Rûm. Conrad split his army into two divisions. Much of the {{authority}} of the Byzantine Empire in the western provinces of Asia Minor was more nominal than real, with much of the provinces being a no-man's land controlled by Turkish nomads. Conrad <b>underestimated</b> <b>the</b> length of the march against Anatolia, and anyhow assumed that the authority of Emperor Manuel was greater in Anatolia than was in fact the case. Conrad took the knights and the best troops with himself to march overland while sending the camp followers with Otto of Freising to follow the coastal road. The king led one of these, which was almost totally destroyed by the Seljuqs on 25 October 1147 at the second battle of Dorylaeum.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to {{problems with the}} Source engine, the designers found that the game's scope exceeded their resources. Bloodlines has several styles of gameplay, requiring different interfaces, animations and artificial intelligence for stealth and melee combat, and first- or third-person capability. Compared to contemporary first-person shooters, with 10 to 20 animated character models, Bloodlines had over 150 characters with 3,000 unique animations, in {{addition to}} boss characters, with their own styles of movement. The designers <b>underestimated</b> <b>the</b> length of time required to develop and improve these systems. The game's scope suffered from content not being removed when necessary; other components would be endlessly refined without being finalized, preventing the developers from focusing on {{other parts of the}} game system. All content additionally required approval by White Wolf and Activision.|$|E
5|$|Initial casting for {{the film}} began in 1971, and Jack Nance was quickly {{selected}} for the lead role. However, {{the staff at the}} AFI had <b>underestimated</b> <b>the</b> project's scale—they had initially green-lit Eraserhead after viewing a twenty-one page screenplay, assuming that the film industry's usual ratio of one minute of film per scripted page would reduce the film to approximately twenty minutes. This misunderstanding, coupled with Lynch's own meticulous direction, caused the film to remain in production for a number of years. In an extreme example of this labored schedule, one scene in the film begins with Nance's character opening a door—a full year passed before he was filmed entering the room. Nance, however, was dedicated to producing the film and retained the unorthodox hairstyle his character sported for the entirety of its gestation.|$|E
5|$|Initially Los Alamos was {{supposed}} to be a military laboratory, and Oppenheimer and other researchers were to be commissioned into the Army. He went so far as to order himself a lieutenant colonel's uniform and take the Army physical test, which he failed. Army doctors considered him underweight at , diagnosed his chronic cough as tuberculosis and were concerned about his chronic lumbosacral joint pain. The plan to commission scientists fell through when Robert Bacher and Isidor Rabi balked at the idea. Conant, Groves, and Oppenheimer devised a compromise whereby the laboratory was operated by the University of California under contract to the War Department. It soon turned out that Oppenheimer had hugely <b>underestimated</b> <b>the</b> magnitude of the project; Los Alamos grew from a few hundred people in 1943 to over 6,000 in 1945.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{forecasts}} significantly <b>underestimated</b> <b>the</b> {{intensification of}} Emilia, {{which was one}} of three tropical cyclones to attain Category5 status in the central Pacific during the season. On July 16, a 72-hour forecast misjudged the strengthening of Emilia by 41m/s (92mph). Later, winds at 72hours were 31m/s (69mph) too high when the cyclone began to weaken. Tropical cyclone forecast models consistently predicted Emilia to remain south of the Hawaiian Islands because of the upper troughs' climatologically weak nature during the summer. This led to high confidence in the forecasts, resulting in a lack of watches or warnings. Nonetheless, a high surf advisory was issued for the south and east coasts of all islands.|$|E
5|$|The Finnish Defence Forces' {{military}} operation plan against the Soviet Union was named Venäjän keskitys ("Russian Concentration"; VK) in the 1920s. In the latest 1934 plan, the Finns saw two possible scenarios. In the VK1 scenario, the Soviets would mobilize all along their western border, and would deploy only limited forces against Finland. In {{this case the}} Finns would make counterattacks across the border. The VK2 scenario envisaged a much more unfavourable situation for the Finns. The main defense line {{would be on the}} Karelian Isthmus, the Finnish forces would repel Soviet attacks in favourable positions, and destroy the enemy by counterattacks. In the Winter War, the VK2 scenario was flexible and its basis proved correct, but the Finnish General staff badly <b>underestimated</b> <b>the</b> numerical superiority of the Red Army.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on DVD in Japan on February 7, 2002, immediately reaching {{the top of the}} DVD/VHS charts.

The DVD distribution rights in the west were acquired by Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment. In 2006, it was ranked as the sixth best-selling anime DVD in the United States. It did not receive a theatrical release in the United Kingdom, instead being released as a direct-to-DVD feature. It was released in the UK on June 27, 2003. The film was later released on Blu-ray disc in Japan on July 25, 2008. It was released in North America on June 28, 2011.|$|E
