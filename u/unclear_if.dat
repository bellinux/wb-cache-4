5|$|Issues {{were handed}} out at Washington, D.C. Metro train stations, and an online copy is {{available}} at www.washingtonblade.com. It is still <b>unclear</b> <b>if</b> DC Agenda will be a profitable publication.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>unclear</b> <b>if</b> The Laws and Practice of Chess is {{just the}} second edition of Chess: Theory and Practice, or a {{completely}} different book.|$|E
5|$|The inquiry did not {{question}} or raise {{concern with the}} areas of slab removal during original construction in 1980 when escalators were installed after the roof was completed. It is <b>unclear</b> <b>if</b> this was a contributing factor.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{subspecies}} has been described, {{but it is}} <b>unclear</b> which, <b>if</b> any, are still valid: ...|$|R
50|$|After the {{assassination}} of Franz Ferdinand, Hartwig encouraged a militant Serbian line against Austria. It is <b>unclear</b> what, <b>if</b> any, role Hartwig might have played {{in connection with the}} Black Hand.|$|R
50|$|Recently, {{the cigar}} that our fluffy {{feathered}} friend smokes has been deemed 'unsuitable' {{by the committee}} that governs Yale apparel. It is <b>unclear</b> when, <b>if</b> ever, this decision will be reversed.|$|R
5|$|Attempts {{are ongoing}} to infect the {{mosquito}} population with bacteria of the Wolbachia genus, {{which makes the}} mosquitoes partially resistant to dengue virus. While artificially induced infections with Wolbachia is effective, it is <b>unclear</b> <b>if</b> naturally acquired infections are protective. Working is still ongoing as of 2015 {{to determine the best}} type of Wolbachia to use.|$|E
5|$|Between 4% and 7% {{of people}} have heel pain {{at any given time}} and about 80% of these cases are due to plantar fasciitis. Approximately 10% {{of people have}} the {{disorder}} at some point during their life. It becomes more common with age. It is <b>unclear</b> <b>if</b> one sex is more affected than the other.|$|E
5|$|Focal {{seizures}} {{begin in}} one hemisphere {{of the brain}} while generalized seizures begin in both hemispheres. Some types of seizures may change brain structure, while others appear to have little effect. Gliosis, neuronal loss, and atrophy of specific {{areas of the brain}} are linked to epilepsy but it is <b>unclear</b> <b>if</b> epilepsy causes these changes or if these changes result in epilepsy.|$|E
50|$|The date of {{the move}} is <b>unclear,</b> {{although}} <b>if</b> it was before 614 then Cuthwulf {{would have been the}} West Saxon commander at the Battle of Beandun mentioned above. This seems likely.|$|R
5000|$|... ∞ Unclear {{position}}: It is <b>unclear</b> who (<b>if</b> anyone) has an advantage. This {{is often}} used when a position is highly asymmetrical, such as Black having a ruined pawn structure but dangerous active piece-play.|$|R
50|$|Excavations during {{development}} {{work in the}} early 19th century revealed the location had previously been {{the location of a}} Roman (or less likely Saxon) baths; however it's <b>unclear</b> what, <b>if</b> anything, remained when the priory was founded.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{retirement}} of John Paul Stevens in June 2010, the Court had an entirely non-Protestant composition {{for the first time}} in its history. Although Neil Gorsuch, appointed in 2017, attends an Episcopalian church, he was raised Catholic and it is <b>unclear</b> <b>if</b> he considers himself a Catholic or a Protestant.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>unclear</b> <b>if</b> {{among those}} with non-chronic back pain {{alternative}} treatments are useful. For chiropractic care or spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) it is <b>unclear</b> <b>if</b> it improves outcomes {{more or less than}} other treatments. Some reviews find that SMT results in equal or better improvements in pain and function when compared with other commonly used interventions for short, intermediate, and long-term follow-up; other reviews find it to be no more effective in reducing pain than either inert interventions, sham manipulation, or other treatments, and conclude that adding SMT to other treatments does improve outcomes. National guidelines reach different conclusions, with some not recommending spinal manipulation, some describing manipulation as optional, and others recommending a short course {{for those who do not}} improve with other treatments. A 2017 review recommended spinal manipulation based on low quality evidence. Manipulation under anaesthesia, or medically assisted manipulation, has not enough evidence to make any confident recommendation.|$|E
5|$|O'Brien {{was also}} {{equipped}} with four twin 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes. The General Board of the United States Navy {{had called for}} two anti-aircraft guns for the O'Brien-class ships, as well as provisions for laying up to 36 floating mines. From sources, it is <b>unclear</b> <b>if</b> these recommendations were followed for O'Brien {{or any of the}} other ships of the class.|$|E
5000|$|Machwürth Team International (MTI) ASIA Pte Ltd, Singapore It is <b>unclear</b> now <b>if</b> MTI {{still has}} {{operations}} in Singapore or South-East Asia, with {{the departure of}} successive Singapore Managing Directors, Vincent Schoon in 2011, and Ines Majewski in 2013.|$|R
50|$|Dr. John (Mac Rebennack) {{appears on}} piano, {{and his voice}} can be heard {{sporadically}} throughout the track. Van Dyke Parks was also present at the recording session, but it is <b>unclear</b> what, <b>if</b> anything, played by him {{was used for the}} released version.|$|R
50|$|In 1020, {{near the}} end of his life, Frederick gave up his title and became a monk at Saint-Vanne Abbey. He was succeeded as Count of Verdun by his brother Herman. It is <b>unclear</b> who, <b>if</b> anyone, succeeded him as Count of Castres.|$|R
5|$|One person {{drowned in}} a cellar in Fort Cobb, and another drowned in Kingfisher. Another storm-related death {{took place in}} Seminole. Three others were found dead after a weather-related {{automobile}} accident also near Carnegie. Another automobile accident fatality took place in Okmulgee County but it is <b>unclear</b> <b>if</b> the event was storm-related. Damage amounted to over $2million (2007USD).|$|E
5|$|Some fossils {{described}} {{under the}} name P.hooijeri {{have been found in}} Vietnam, and multiple fossil subspecies have been described from several parts of southeastern Asia. It is <b>unclear</b> <b>if</b> these belong to P.pygmaeus or P.abelii or, in fact, represent distinct species.|$|E
5|$|Suicidal {{behavior}} {{is less of}} a concern when bupropion is prescribed for smoking cessation. According to a 2014 Cochrane review, while there is an association with suicide it is <b>unclear</b> <b>if</b> bupropion was the cause. In 2016 the FDA removed the black box warning about psychiatric problems when used for stopping smoking.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{documented}} that Elmore James performed with Sonny Boy Williamson II, it is <b>unclear</b> which, <b>if</b> any, of Williamson's early recordings include James as a sideman. It is unknown if James performed on additional recordings by Big Joe Turner and Junior Wells.|$|R
5000|$|Such marking and {{counting}} could {{be carried out}} on an ordinary ballot with no provision for it, however, there would be risk of counting it as [...] "spoiled" [...] if the marks were <b>unclear,</b> and <b>if</b> ballot design had not allowed for it initially.|$|R
5000|$|Rosalind is {{reunited with}} her {{daughter}}. Her daughter and Helen's son live together and eventually establish a relationship {{and plan to}} wed. It is <b>unclear,</b> however, <b>if</b> they follow the traditional marriage vows as Rosalind did or whether they reject them as Lionel and Helen did.|$|R
5|$|Æthelwig died {{in either}} 1077 or 1078. The Chronicon gives his death date as 16 February 1077, {{but it is}} <b>unclear</b> <b>if</b> the Chronicon began its years on 1 January or in March, so the date could be 1077 or 1078.|$|E
5|$|E. Midy {{proved a}} general result about such fractions, now called Midy's theorem, in 1836. The {{publication}} was obscure, {{and it is}} <b>unclear</b> <b>if</b> his proof directly involved 0.999..., {{but at least one}} modern proof by W. G. Leavitt does. If it can be proved that a decimal of the form 0.b1b2b3... is a positive integer, then it must be 0.999..., which is then the source of the 9s in the theorem. Investigations in this direction can motivate such concepts as greatest common divisors, modular arithmetic, Fermat primes, order of group elements, and quadratic reciprocity.|$|E
5|$|Early {{fish from}} the fossil record are {{represented}} {{by a group of}} small, jawless, armored fish known as ostracoderms. Jawless fish lineages are mostly extinct. An extant clade, the lampreys may approximate ancient pre-jawed fish. The first jaws are found in Placodermi fossils. The diversity of jawed vertebrates may indicate the evolutionary advantage of a jawed mouth. It is <b>unclear</b> <b>if</b> the advantage of a hinged jaw is greater biting force, improved respiration, or a combination of factors.|$|E
2500|$|It is <b>unclear,</b> however, <b>if</b> taking {{additional}} vitamin D in {{the diet}} or as supplements affects the risk of cancer. [...] Reviews have described the evidence as being [...] "inconsistent, inconclusive as to causality, and insufficient to inform nutritional requirements" [...] and [...] "not sufficiently robust to draw conclusions".|$|R
50|$|According to Pollard, it is <b>unclear</b> who, <b>if</b> anyone, became Westmorland's {{guardian}} {{after the}} death of his brother, Sir Thomas Neville; however surviving documents indicate that Richard, Duke of Gloucester, the future Richard III, acquired an interest in Westmorland's estates, and occasionally used Raby Castle as his own residence.|$|R
50|$|If fully {{autonomous}} cars become commercially available, {{they have}} {{the potential to be a}} disruptive innovation with major implications for society. The likelihood of widespread adoption is still <b>unclear,</b> but <b>if</b> they are used on a wide scale, policy makers face a number of unresolved questions about their effects.|$|R
5|$|In 2006 it was <b>unclear</b> <b>if</b> Beth Israel, {{which had}} already been in {{difficult}} financial shape, would be allowed, or have the means, to re-build its synagogue. The building suffered further flood damage in July 2007 when thieves stole the copper tubing for the main air-conditioning system. They broke the water main, and water from the second floor flooded the building for three days, {{to a depth of}} three to four feet, before it was discovered. The property was put up for sale.|$|E
5|$|In May 2009, President Barack Obama {{nominated}} a Catholic woman, Sonia Sotomayor, {{to replace}} retiring Justice David Souter. Her confirmation raised {{the number of}} Catholics on the Court to six, compared to three non-Catholics (all Jewish). With Antonin Scalia's death in February 2016, the number of Catholic Justices went back to five. Neil Gorsuch, appointed in 2017, was raised Catholic but attends an Episcopalian church; it is <b>unclear</b> <b>if</b> he considers himself a Catholic or a Protestant.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether John Doukas married once or twice. The name of only one wife, Zoe Doukaina, is known. She was the {{daughter}} of Constantine Doukas and Anna Doukaina, whose exact identity is <b>unclear.</b> <b>If</b> he married twice, then his first marriage took place c. 1150, and his unknown first wife must have died c. 1165. If Zoe Doukaina was indeed his second wife, this marriage took place c. 1170.|$|E
5000|$|It is <b>unclear,</b> however, <b>if</b> taking {{additional}} vitamin D in {{the diet}} or as supplements affects the risk of cancer. Reviews have described the evidence as being [...] "inconsistent, inconclusive as to causality, and insufficient to inform nutritional requirements" [...] and [...] "not sufficiently robust to draw conclusions".|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of the Demolition Team and the Supermen of America, it is <b>unclear</b> how many (<b>if</b> any) of their members were slain by OMACs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{name of the}} {{settlement}} {{is derived from the}} name of the Konosha River. The name of the river contains two element: -sha, which means [...] "water" [...] in the relevant Finnic languages, and -kon, which <b>unclear</b> etymology. <b>If</b> it {{is considered to be a}} Slavic word, it may mean either [...] "beginning" [...] or [...] "border".|$|R
