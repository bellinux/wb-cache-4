50|$|From a legal standpoint, {{multimodal}} transport creates several problems. <b>Unimodal</b> <b>transports</b> are currently governed by different, often-mandatory international conventions. These conventions stipulate different bases for liability, and different limitations of liability for the carrier. As of 2011, {{the solution to}} this problem has been the so-called network principle. According to the network principle, the different conventions coexist unchanged; the carrier’s liability is defined according to where the breach of contract has occurred (where the goods have been damaged during transport, for example).

40|$|The {{title of}} my master thesis is “Using {{time-dependent}} route choice model {{to analyze the}} profitability of multimodal transport in flower industry [...] From the perspective of buyers of the FloraHolland”. The report aims to analyze the profitability of cut flower transport using multimodal transport in short/medium-distance by building a time-dependent route choice model to choose an optimal route between the origin and the destination by comparing the route costs of multimodal and <b>unimodal</b> <b>transport</b> {{from the perspective of}} buyers of the FloraHolland Company. The first chapter introduces what and how the report is going to research the topic based on relevant studies having been done. The second chapter illustrates the background of the flower industry, including the introduction of different species of cut flower, the supply chain of rose of the cut flower and analysis of stakeholders of transport section of the supply chain. The problem statement, research objective, scope and research approach are demonstrated in chapter three. The report reviews the literature in freight planning, route choice approach, static and dynamic traffic models in chapter four. Time-dependent model is constructed in the fifth chapter, and the computational process of Matlab software is explained. Chapter six is a case study of the model. The input data of the case come from references, interviewing with stakeholders, Google map, and assumptions. Sensitivity analysis of constants is applied for validation. In the following analysis {{of the results of the}} case, the influences of factors of the model are analyzed. Then, an ideal scenario for multimodal is concluded from previous analyzes. The choice of departure time at the origin results in different schedule delay costs and different congestion level on the highway. Then, transport time of one route from the origin to the destination is changing with departure time. In the cost function of the model, transport time is an important variable. Thus, the choice of optimal route from the origin to the destination is changing with the choice of departure time. This deduction is simulated and analyzed in the case study. In the preliminary results of the case study, the time-dependent optimal routes are mainly in <b>unimodal</b> <b>transport.</b> The routes in multimodal transport can be the optimal choice when stakeholders introduce policies benefit to main modes of multimodal transport. In the conclusion of the report, multimodal transport is not more beneficial than <b>unimodal</b> <b>transport</b> for buyers from the initial results of the model which represents the current situation. However, multimodal transport can be profitability in flower industry from the perspective of buyers of the FloraHolland Company if the stakeholders formulate policies beneficial to multimodal transport.

Windmills are examples of special goods with challenges both with respect to high weight and large size. At least in Europe, the focus on green energy entails rapid development of windmill projects where components needing special handling is transported over great distances. This paper studies the transport of windmills from Continental Europe to Norway where challenges are related to the long-transport distance, low road standard and rough climate. Different transport strategies are presented and discussed in relation to a theoretical model aiming to minimize the generalized transport costs. It is argued that <b>unimodal</b> <b>transport</b> by truck is not practically possible due to many insuperable barriers. Therefore, two types of intermodal transport are suggested of which the benefits of reduced handling at terminals are weighted against lower capacity utilization at the water based long-haul distance.

30|$|According to Behrends (2011 : 34), the {{implementation}} {{problems of the}} CCFT system are often attributed to both technological and organizational complexity of this transport mode. Thus, the additional expenses in the transport organization, which should be overcome by the decision to select this transport mode, can {{be considered to be}} a barrier to modal shift. Because of the diversity of actors, each of whom organizes and controls part of the transport chain, the level of complexity in the CCFT system is higher than in <b>unimodal</b> <b>transport</b> modes (Bontekoning et al. 2004). In the CCFT system, the following components can be distinguished: pre- and post-carriage by the road transport (collection and distribution from shippers to receivers), the exchange of loading units at the intermodal (rail/road) terminals and the rail line hauling (main haul) (Janic 2008). In contrast to studies that investigate shippers as decision makers in the transport mode choice, the present study focuses on freight forwarders. The decision to concentrate on forwarders was based on the following reasons. With an increasing tendency to outsource, companies delegate transport organization and mode decisions to third parties who make it possible to benefit from the forwarder’s knowledge and skills of the specific transport market (Bergantino and Bolis 2004). Regardless whether the forwarder’s disposition form is self-fulfilling or subcontracting, an adaptation in the organizational routine maybe necessary for CCFT to be considered to be a transport mode option. In the event that a forwarder decides to use CCFT, he must organize the transport chain, which consists of the pre- and post-carriage and main haul, and he must work together with the actors in the particular subsystems (road hauler, intermodal transport operator, intermodal terminal provider) (Ishfaq and Sox 2010). Depending on the current disposition form, specific barriers for the decision to use a CCFT system can arise. However, in both cases, the contractual agreements with other forwarders or road haulers are necessary to organize the post-carriage of transport (Chiara et al. 2008). In addition, the issue of how to organize the return transport of the disposed semi-trailer must be addressed. Particularly in cases of transport subcontracting, additional barriers may occur. If the forwarder decides to dispose the semi-trailer in the CCFT by keeping the contract with the current road hauler, the road hauler must change his business model and shift from long distance operations to operations in the pre- or post-carriage. Consequently, in contrast to RFT, the forwarder in the CCFT system must take control over the semi-trailer of the road hauler to ensure the post-carriage and return transport while also considering the business interests of the partner in the business model change. The demonstrated changes in the set of organizational routines that are required for the shift from RFT to CCFT can result in additional expenses for the transport organization, thus becoming a potential barrier to the modal shift. This is especially true in the case of transport subcontracting where the willingness to shift to combined transport maybe lower than in the case where the forwarder has his own fleet. In the following, the theoretical underpinnings that explain the expected forwarder’s behavior are developed.|$|E

40|$|The northeastern Carpentaria Basin, a Mesozoic sequence, is {{situated}} on northern Cape York Peninsula, Queensland. Late Devonian to Early Carboniferous Pascoe River Beds and unnamed Permian sediments underlie the Carpentaria Basin within the study area. The Pascoe River Beds are subdivided into three informal units. The lower two units were deposited on a mature topography by a meandering fluvial system whereas the upper unit was deposited subaqueously, probably in a lacustrine environment. Some contemporaneous volcanism accompanied sedimentation of the Pascoe River Beds. The sequence was buried to depths of about three kilometres {{and had a}} complex diagenetic history, undergoing at least one episode of folding, uplift and erosion prior to the Late Permian. Unnamed Permian sediments deposited in a cold climate by a high sinuosity meandering river system include thin overbank coal seams. The sediments were restricted to northwesterly trending, structurally controlled valleys flanked in part by crystalline basement. The sediments underwent minimal burial prior to the Jurassic. Sedimentation in the northeastern Carpentaria Basin began in the Middle Jurassic and continued through into the Early Cretaceous. The climate was tropical, probably with seasonal rainfall and flooding. The pre-Mesozoic surface was a mature topography with gentle relief. Highlands were present to the east, and valleys and ridges trended in a northwesterly, direction. Moderately sinuous fluvial systems occupied the valley floors and deposited mainly quartzose sands of the Wenlock Member. The sediment {{was derived from the}} highlands and shows a <b>unimodal</b> <b>transport</b> direction. Each valley 2 ̆ 7 s fluvial system was similar but probably unconnected. There was considerable vegetation and the water table was high facilitating the development of discontinuous coal seams. A shallow marine transgression from the north followed, inundating both the fluvial systems in the valleys and the adjacent basement ridges. The highlands in the east remained exposed and the marine environment probably extended no further south than the Pascoe River area. Ooliths, chamositic-rich sandstone and mudstone were deposited forming the Bromley Member. Bottom water temperatures were greater than 20 °C. The sea then regressed leaving extensive low relief plains. Sediments were carried from the eastern highlands and deposited in bed-load dominated, braided fluvial systems, forming the extensive sheet sands of the Wreath Member. The sedimentary history from this period on was dominated by a progressive marine transgression which occurred as a number of pulses. The encroachment of the sea, due to subsidence and eustatic changes, was from the west. The transgressive sequence was heralded by the deposition of the Batavia Member in a distal meandering river environment which was transitional between a braided river system and a near shore marine system. Deposition was tidally influenced, with the dominant palaeocurrent direction oriented towards the east. The Glennie and Briscoe Members were deposited during two transgressive episodes. The coarsening upward cycles in these members consist of bioturbated laminated mudstone overlain by marine sandstone with Skolithos burrows. The cycles were deposited in a wave and tide-dominated clastic shore-line environment. A further marine transgression accompanied deposition of the basal Rolling Downs Group. This sequence, of glauconitic mudstone and sandstone, was deposited in a shallow marine environment below wave base in waters with temperatures greater than 20 °C. Additional sediments were deposited over the area because geothermal gradient studies show burial of the basal Rolling Downs Group to a depth of at least 750 m. Sedimentological characteristics in the study area indicate the Permian sediments, Wenlock Member and Batavia Member have a low potential for economic coal deposits. However, the sedimentary sequences have suitable source rocks, reservoirs, seals, anticlinal structures and levels of organic maturation to host accumulations of hydrocarbons. Extending and correlating the studied sequence towards the west suggests the entire Carpentaria Basin has a significant hydrocarbon potential...|$|E

In {{regions with}} an {{extensive}} waterway network intermodal transport including inland navigation {{is a good}} alternative for <b>unimodal</b> road <b>transport.</b> In-termodal transport networks exhibit an increased complexity due to the inclusion of multiple transport modes, multiple decision makers and multiple types of load units.

The simulation model allows to quantify a number of network properties resulting from the interaction of freight flows. The intermodal hinterland network of the port of Antwerp serves as the real-world application in this study.

30|$|At {{the port}} {{intermodal}} barge transport has larger handling costs compared to <b>unimodal</b> road <b>transport.</b> This {{is due to}} the cranes that are being used for the transhipment of containers on barges. The main haulage is carried by barge. The advantage of intermodal transport lies in the smaller variable costs during main haulage, {{as a result of the}} scale economies that are obtained by the large capacities that can be used. Scale economies, gained by the main haulage leg of an intermodal transport chain, can further be increased by an introduction of larger vessels. As the variable costs of barge transport is cheaper compared to road-only transport, longer distance covered by the intermodal leg will make intermodal barge transport more efficient than road-only transport. At the end of the chain, this advantage is partly compensated by the extra handling cost that has to be paid for the terminal handling. Terminal operations necessary to tranship the goods from one mode to another imply a vertical leap in the cost curve. Reliable terminal operations will contribute to prevent costs that take place in transhipping a container from the main haulage to the drayage. In order to achieve reliable operations and optimise the terminal processes, ICT applications will be needed. Special attention for empty containers is also required. The post haulage in the intermodal transport chain is performed by road. The cost curve of intermodal freight transport thus runs parallel to <b>unimodal</b> road <b>transport.</b> Once the total intermodal cost is calculated, it is possible to make comparisons with road-only transport, opening the way to a series of possible scenarios that can be assessed using an appropriate set of tools.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Today, {{there is}} {{widespread}} consensus about the notable, yet simultaneously growing, negative environmental impacts generated by the transportation sector. Experts working {{in a number of}} different fields consider the current situation to be unsustainable and possible measures to reduce emissions and foster sustainability are being encouraged. The European Commission has highlighted the need to shift away from <b>unimodal</b> road <b>transport</b> toward a greater use of intermodal transport through, for example, motorways of the sea, in light of the evidence that the former makes a significant contribution to increased CO 2 emissions. However, although there is a general perception that sea transport is environmentally preferable to road transport, recent studies are beginning to question this assumption. Moreover, little research has been conducted to quantify environmental aspects and incorporate them into the decision-making processes involved in the modal shift. This study first reviews the existing literature to examine the extent to which environmental aspects are relevant in the modal choice in the case of short sea shipping and motorways of the sea.

The channel aggraded and steepened until stabilized by occasional gravel extraction in recent decades.

30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{decision}} support framework to analyze policies supporting the intermodal transport industry. The framework {{consists of three}} models: NODUS, LAMBIT and SIMBA. The combination of the models allows an analysis at multiple levels of aggregation and for multiple transport modes. The framework is applied in a case study to analyse in depth the location of intermodal terminals. The NODUS optimisation model shows that in the current terminal landscape a terminal location at Roucourt {{might be the most}} interesting choice. Verification of the potential market area by the LAMBIT model shows that the terminal will make new municipalities open for intermodal transport that are currently served by <b>unimodal</b> road <b>transport.</b> Although a small market area exists for the new terminal, it complements a market for intermodal transport together with the terminal in Avelgem. The SIMBA model shows that the introduction of a new terminal has no influence on the turnaround times of existing terminals. The average handling time at sea terminals in the port area increases only slightly due to the introduction of a new terminal in the waterways network. The case study demonstrates the possibilities of the framework for supporting the decision makers in intermodal freight transport sector. The methodology can also be applied to other policy measures such as subsidies, internalisation of external costs and intermodal network.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to address}} the linkage between {{logistics}} (in particular, the management of marketing channel flows) and transport markets, while also the interaction between these two markets and inter-modal container terminals is analysed. The marketing channel theory is used to describe all relevant actors and flows that run through marketing channels, starting with customer needs and ending with customer satisfaction. Porter's theory of competitive advantages is used to review competitive forces in both markets. Finally, a competitor analysis is performed for the logistics and transport market. These theories are applied {{so as to be}} able to determine the competitive position of inter-modal container terminals with a view to the management of marketing channel flows and the physical transport of freight flows. Hence, the central question of this paper is: Which markets are served by inter-modal container terminals and with whom are they competing? At present, neither the maritime container terminals nor the continental container terminals appear to have a significant influence in the logistics service market; they concentrate mainly on the physical movement of containers (transshipment). Furthermore, maritime container terminals and continental container terminals are not dominant players in the transport service market.

40|$|This {{paper is}} about {{distance}} and time as factors of competitiveness of intermodal transport. It reviews {{the relevance of}} the factors, evaluates time models in practice, compares network distances and times in alternative bundling networks with geometrically varied layouts, and points out how these networks perform in terms of vehicle scale, frequency and door-to-door time. The analysis focuses on intermodal transport in Europe, especially intermodal rail transport, but is in search for generic conclusions. The paper does not incorporate the distance and time results in cost models, and draws conclusions for transport innovation, wherever this is possible without cost modelling. For instance, the feature vehicle scale, an important factor of transport costs, is analysed and discussed. Distance and time are important factors of competitiveness of intermodal transport. They generate (direct) vehicle costs and - via transport quality - indirect costs to the customers. Clearly direct costs/prices are the most important performance of the intermodal transport system. The relevance of quality performances is less clarified. Customers emphasise the importance of a good match between the transport and the logistic system. In this framework (time) reliability is valued high. Often transport time, arrival and departure times, and frequency have a lower priority. But such conclusions can hardy be generalised. The range of valuations reflects the heterogeneity of situations. Some lack of clarity is obviously due to overlapping definitions of different performance types. The following parts of the paper are about two central fields of network design, which have a large impact on transport costs and quality, namely the design of vehicle roundtrips (and acceleration of transport speed) and the choice of bundling type: do vehicles provide direct services or run in what we call complex bundling networks? An example is the hub-and-spoke network. The objective of complex bundling is to increase vehicle scale and/or transport frequency even if network volumes are restricted. Complex bundling requires intermediate nodes for the exchange of load units. Examples of complex bundling networks are the hub-and-spoke network or the line network. Roundtrip and bundling design are interrelated policy fields: an acceleration of the roundtrip speed, often desirable from the cost point of view, can often only be carried out customer friendly, if the transport frequency is increased. But often the flow size is not sufficient for a higher frequency. Then a change of bundling model can be an outcome. Complex bundling networks are known to have longer average distances and times, the latter also due to the presence of additional intermediate exchange nodes. However, this disadvantage is - inside the limits of maximal vehicle sizes - overruled by the advantage of a restricted number of network links. Therefore generally, complex bundling networks have shorter total vehicle distances and times. This expression of economies of scale implies lower vehicle costs per load unit. The last part of the paper presents door-to-door times of load units of complex bundling networks and compares them with <b>unimodal</b> road <b>transport.</b> The times of complex bundling networks are larger than that of networks with direct connections, but nevertheless competitive with <b>unimodal</b> road <b>transport,</b> except for short distances. ...|$|R
40|$|This study uses a geographically-explicit cost {{optimization}} model {{to analyze the}} impact of and interrelation between four cost reduction strategies for biofuel production: economies of scale, intermodal transport, integration with existing industries, and distributed supply chain configurations (i. e. supply chains with an intermediate pre-treatment step to reduce biomass transport cost). The model assessed biofuel production levels ranging from 1 to 150  PJ a− 1 {{in the context of}} the existing Swedish forest industry. Biofuel was produced from forestry biomass using hydrothermal liquefaction and hydroprocessing. Simultaneous implementation of all cost reduction strategies yielded minimum biofuel production costs of 18. 1 – 18. 2 € GJ− 1 at biofuel production levels between 10 and 75  PJ a− 1. Limiting the economies of scale was shown to cause the largest cost increase (+ 0 – 12 %, increasing with biofuel production level), followed by disabling integration benefits (+ 1 – 10 %, decreasing with biofuel production level) and allowing <b>unimodal</b> truck <b>transport</b> only (+ 0 – 6 %, increasing with biofuel production level). Distributed supply chain configurations were introduced once biomass supply became increasingly dispersed, but did not provide a significant cost benefit (< 1 %). Disabling the benefits of integration favors large-scale centralized production, while intermodal transport networks positively affect the benefits of economies of scale. As biofuel production costs still exceeds the price of fossil transport fuels in Sweden after implementation of all cost reduction strategies, policy support and stimulation of further technological learning remains essential to achieve cost parity with fossil fuels for this feedstock/technology combination in this spatiotemporal context.

40|$|Today, {{there is}} {{widespread}} consensus about the notable, yet simultaneously growing, negative environmental impacts generated by the transportation sector. Experts working {{in a number of}} different fields consider the current situation to be unsustainable and possible measures to reduce emissions and foster sustainability are being encouraged. The European Commission has highlighted the need to shift away from <b>unimodal</b> road <b>transport</b> toward a greater use of intermodal transport through, for example, motorways of the sea, in light of the evidence that the former makes a significant contribution to increased CO 2 emissions. However, although there is a general perception that sea transport is environmentally preferable to road transport, recent studies are beginning to question this assumption. Moreover, little research has been conducted to quantify environmental aspects and incorporate them into the decision-making processes involved in the modal shift. This study first reviews the existing literature to examine the extent to which environmental aspects are relevant in the modal choice in the case of short sea shipping and motorways of the sea. Related to this, the study also evaluates the role that different agents may play in making decisions about choice of mode, taking into consideration environmental aspects. Secondly, we use the values the European Commission provides to calculate external costs for the Marco Polo freight transport project proposals (call 2013) to estimate the environmental costs for several routes (a total of 72), comparing the use of road haulage with the intermodal option that incorporates the Spanish motorways of the sea. The results of this comparative analysis show that the intermodal option is not always the best choice in environmental terms. Consequently, the traditional environmental argument to justify this alternative must be used carefully...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Geographic {{proximity}} to health facilities is a known determinant {{of access to}} maternal care. Methods of quantifying geographical access to care have largely ignored the impact of precipitation and flooding. Further, travel has largely been imagined as <b>unimodal</b> where one <b>transport</b> mode is used for entire journeys to seek care. This study proposes a new approach for modeling potential spatio-temporal access by evaluating the impact of precipitation and floods on access to maternal health services using multiple transport modes, in southern Mozambique. Methods A facility assessment was used to classify 56 health centres. GPS coordinates of the health facilities were acquired from the Ministry of Health while roads were digitized and classified from high-resolution satellite images. Data on the geographic distribution of populations of women of reproductive age, pregnancies and births within the preceding 120 months, and transport options available to pregnant women were collected from a household census. Daily precipitation and flood data were used to model the impact of severe weather on access for a 17 -month timeline. Travel times to the nearest health facilities were calculated using the closest facility tool in ArcGIS software. Results Forty-six and 87 percent of pregnant women lived within a 1 -h of the nearest primary care centre using walking or public transport modes respectively. The populations within these catchments dropped by 9 and 5...|$|R
