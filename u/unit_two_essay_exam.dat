Even though the majority of the learners in the study were teacher centered and had not experienced this new LC EFL <b>Essay</b> <b>Exam,</b> or this new LC Grading Method before: the learners reported that they were tested and graded more fairly and more accurately, than traditional exam and grading methods.

40|$|When {{designing}} {{an assessment}} task, a genre must be selected {{that will allow}} students to demonstrate their knowledge. Choice of task is important as student perceptions of assessment tasks impact on their approach to learning, engagement, motivation, and self-efficacy (Struyven, Dochy, & Janssens, 2005; Lizzio & Wilson, 2013). While innovation is encouraged, student perceptions of novel assessment tasks are mixed; many initially preferring more traditional genres where they have succeeded in the past (Bevitt, 2015; Struyven & Devesa, 2016). This study explored 1 st year Nursing students’ perceptions of three course assessment tasks, delivered via both on-campus and distance modes. While <b>two</b> tasks (<b>essay,</b> <b>exam)</b> adopted genres common within higher education, the third task was a Clinical Skills Audit, a practical demonstration of hands-on skills {{in front of an}} assessor. Data were gathered from two cohorts of nursing students via surveys (n= 109) and qualitative interviews (n= 25) to examine students’ perceptions of each task, including its value, difficulty, and their level of effort. Findings indicate that while students were initially anxious about the Clinical Skills Audit as for many it was an assessment genre they had not previously experienced, the support offered and its low-stakes nature (i. e., it was pass/fail and multiple attempts were allowed) helped them feel more comfortable with the assessment process and led them to ultimately rate this task as most valuable. These findings suggest that students can be persuaded to value unfamiliar assessment genres, but that it is advisable to provide significant scaffolding, initially introduce them in relatively low-stakes situations, and make sure they have a strong connection with what students perceive as real world professional knowledge and skills.

30|$|In the {{practice}} of designing examinations, where the emphasis is normally on the assessment of {{knowledge and understanding of}} content covered, the authenticity of that assessment model related to skills required for employability, as well as our growing access to instant information, is often missed. Some traditional methods of this form of assessment, particularly the paper based <b>essay</b> <b>exam,</b> have expectations of writing quality and structure as well as of knowledge and understanding, but without providing the tools with which to appropriately meet those expectations. To address this, a computer based, unseen, <b>essay</b> format <b>exam</b> was introduced to a final year module for applied science students, where access was permitted to specific online journal resources. Students wrote their submissions under controlled conditions in Microsoft Word and submitted it through the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE), Blackboard for grading.|$|R

40|$|In {{the current}} paper on writing {{assessment}} surveys {{the literature on}} {{the reliability and validity of}} essay tests. The paper aims to examine the two concepts in relationship with essay testing as well as to provide a snapshot of the current understandings of the reliability and validity of essay tests as drawn in recent research studies. Bearing in mind that essay tests are the most crucially and widely used direct writing assessments worldwide, our research is driven by the fact that successful implementation of assessment practices depends on an understanding of reliability and validity. The review focuses primarily on the general theoretical and practical aspects of reliability and validity and particularly on the evolution within and the relationship between the two concepts. Aspiring to synthesize research findings about the validity and reliability of <b>essay</b> <b>exams</b> as a means of direct testing of writing, we focus on the three main axes raters, scoring scales, and the prompt of an essay test. The results would inform test developers and language testing researchers about the current status and future directions of writing assessment research. Research of this kind is needed so that a fuller understanding of the validity and reliability of <b>essay</b> <b>exams</b> is achieved. Key words: essay testing, validity, reliability 1...|$|R
