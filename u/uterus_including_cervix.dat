Overall image diagnostic quality of normal anatomy and potential pathologies (if present) within the uterus, cervix, ovaries, intestine or bladder were ranked according to the following scale: 1 [*]=[*]non-diagnostic, 2 [*]=[*]poor, 3 [*]=[*]fair yet still diagnostic, 4 [*]=[*]good, 5 [*]=[*]excellent. The severity of ghosting or streak artefacts was scored as follows: 1 [*]=[*]profound, non-diagnostic, 2 [*]=[*]severe yet still diagnostic, 3 [*]=[*]moderate, disturbing but diagnostic 4 [*]=[*]visible, non-disturbing, 5 [*]=[*]imperceptible. Zonal anatomy of the <b>uterus</b> <b>including</b> <b>cervix</b> delineation and conspicuity was assessed on a five-point scale according to: 1 [*]=[*]major blurring, 2 [*]=[*]inhomogeneous blurring, 3 [*]=[*]moderate blurring but diagnostic, 4 [*]=[*]slightly visible blurring, 5 [*]=[*]sharp margins of structures. Readers were asked to rate presence of fluid in the pouch of Douglas and its visibility. Finally, readers were asked to indicate their preferred sequence (sagittal T 2 -weighted BLADE TSE or sagittal T 2 -weighted TSE) taking into account the diagnostic performance and overall contrast. If no difference was visible equal ranking was allowed.|$|E

40|$|Fluorescence {{spectroscopy}} {{is one of}} many optical {{methods that}} are potentially clinically useful for noninvasive detection and characterization of disorders on the cervical part of <b>uterus,</b> <b>including</b> precancerous lesions. The cervix uteri exhibits a biologically complex tissue and the morphology of a biopsy is generally not homogenous. The standard histopathological protocol accounts only for the most severe condition found within the biopsy and no information is given on other constituents potentially influencing the recorded fluorescence spectra. Spectra are usually correlated, using multivariate techniques, to the histopathological diagnosis of the biopsies. Since the probe volume of fluorescence spectroscopy is considerably smaller than the extension of the biopsy, this can cause problems in the search for correlation between the fluorescence signals and the pathological structures. In addition, the orientation and location of the biopsies are normally not recorded. We now report on the first detailed histopathological protocol where numerous tissue parameters, such as thickness and type of the epithelium and the number of blood vessels, glands, and inflammatory cells, are tabulated and the orientation and location of the biopsy are recorded as precisely as possible. Hopefully, the use of this protocol together with sophisticated mathematical methods will increase the probability to classify cervical disorders of the <b>uterus,</b> <b>including</b> precancerous lesions, with high sensitivity and specificity...|$|R

Moreover, we believe this method helps modify the traditional approach to the myometrium based on multiple myomectomies, thus avoiding additional incisions and damage to uterine tissue and allowing the determination of the absence of residual tumor or satellite nodules in a new-shaped uterus.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Fluorescence imaging {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} {{to be able to}} detect and diagnose different tumour types in a range of biological tissues <b>including</b> <b>cervix,</b> lung, and along the gastrointestinal tract. An approach based on laser induced tissue autofluorescence may be applied minimally invasively using endoscopes, although there is a high degree of overlap in endogenous fluorophore excitation/emission spectra. This paper presents a tuneable laser induced fluorescence imaging system that is able to increase specificity through simultaneous variation of excitation and emission wavelengths. The method is validated using fluorescent laser dyes with data analysis being performed with fixed reference isomap (FR-IsoMap). The method is compared to principle component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction to demonstrate the improved specificity and sensitivity achieved based on one-way Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA). 1...|$|R

The ability of FOXOs to regulate seemingly opposing cellular responses, ranging from cell cycle arrest and oxidative stress responses to differentiation and apoptosis, renders these transcription factors indispensable for cyclic tissue remodelling in female reproduction. Conversely, perturbations in the expression or activity of FOXO transcription factors are increasingly linked to common reproductive disorders, such as pregnancy loss, endometriosis, endometrial cancer and primary ovarian insufficiency...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{fusion of}} the Caenorhabditis elegans uterine anchor cell (AC) with the uterine-seam cell (utse) is an {{excellent}} model system for studying cell–cell fusion, which is essential to animal development. We obtained an egg-laying defective (Egl) mutant in which the AC fails to fuse with the utse. This defect is highly specific: other aspects of utse development and other cell fusions appear to occur normally. We find that defect {{is due to a}} missense mutation in the nsf- 1 gene, which encodes N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF), an intracellular membrane fusion factor. There are two NSF- 1 isoforms, which are expressed in distinct tissues through two separate promoters. NSF- 1 L is expressed in the <b>uterus,</b> <b>including</b> the AC. We find that nsf- 1 is required cell-autonomously in the AC for its fusion with the utse. Our results establish AC fusion as a paradigm for studying cell fusion at single cell resolution and demonstrate that the NSF ATPase is a key player in this process...|$|R
40|$|All {{fundamental}} reproductive {{events in}} the human ovary and <b>uterus,</b> <b>including</b> ovulation, implantation and menstruation, are dependent upon profound tissue remodelling, characterized by cyclical waves of cell proliferation, differentiation, recruitment of inflammatory cells, apoptosis, tissue breakdown and regeneration. Although {{the rise and fall}} in ovarian hormones, estradiol and progesterone, orchestrate these reproductive events, FOXO transcription factors, an evolutionary conserved subfamily of forkhead transcription factors, have emerged major downstream effector molecules, capable of integrating hormonal cues with a variety of stress, growth factor and cytokine signal transduction pathways. The ability of FOXOs to regulate seemingly opposing cellular responses, ranging from cell cycle arrest and oxidative stress responses to differentiation and apoptosis, renders these transcription factors indispensable for cyclic tissue remodelling in the reproductive tract. Aberrant expression or perturbed activity of FOXO transcription factors are increasingly linked to prevalent reproductive disorders, such as endometriosis, endometrial cancer, primary ovarian insufficiency and pregnancy failure, which in turn highlights their potential as therapeutic targets...|$|R

40|$|Ranging from aplastic <b>uterus</b> (<b>including</b> Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome) to {{incomplete}} septate uterus, uterine malformations as a {{group are}} relatively frequent in the general population. Specific causes remain largely unknown. Although most occurrences ostensibly seem sporadic, familial recurrences have been observed, which strongly implicate genetic factors. Through the study of animal models, human syndromes, and structural chromosomal variation, several candidate genes have been proposed and subsequently tested with targeted methods in series of individuals with isolated, non-isolated, or syndromic uterine malformations. To date, a few genes have garnered strong evidence of causality, mainly in syndromic presentations (HNF 1 B, WNT 4, WNT 7 A, HOXA 13). Sequencing of candidate genes in series of individuals with isolated uterine abnormalities {{has been able to}} suggest an association for several genes, but confirmation of a strong causative effect is still lacking for the majority of them. We review the current state of knowledge about the developmental origins of uterine malformations, with a focus on the genetic variants that have been implicated or associated with these conditions in humans, and we discuss potential reasons for the high rate of negative results. The evidence for various environmental and epigenetic factors is also reviewed. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Fifty-five samples of normal cervix and endometrium, 40 samples of nonmalignant disturbances, 15 benign tumor samples, and 20 malignant samples were studied. Very strong ESR signals were seen in frozen powders and frozen intact samples of normal cervix and endometrium and in nonmalignant gynecological conditions. In many cases, the ESR signal was greatly decreased or even undetectable in cancer samples. The substance(s) responsible for the ESR signal in frozen intact tissue (g = 2. 11 to 2. 15) is decreased in concentration when the sample is ground to powder under liquid nitrogen, and an anisotropic signal (g = 2. 002 to 2. 035) then becomes much more evident. The ESR signals in intact and in powder samples are sensitive to temperature variations; the signals disappear around 0 °, and only the intact samples show significant recovery of signal on recooling. The anisotropic g values and temperature sensitivity in the powders may result from an organic peroxy radical that is more strongly associated with a metal ion in intact samples...|$|R
