40|$|<b>University</b> <b>libraries</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} units in universities that aim to provide the best service to their users. Because it is their libraries that guide to the universities where science is produced therefore, human resources in the <b>university</b> <b>libraries</b> have the same equal importance. In order to provide better service in the <b>university</b> <b>libraries,</b> one of the indispensible element is to have certified librarians who are expert on their topics. In this research, the evaluation of the relationship between the number of staff that the foundation & the public libraries has and the number of users they have and the number of staff with the librarianship degree have been made. In addition, number of users and staff standard in the work called “University Libraries in Turkey towards 2023, Current Situation, Problems, Standards and Solution Proposals” and suitability of the data to the standards that the resarcher has currently have been examined.

40|$|Purpose: This paper aims at {{identifying}} the available digital information products/services (DIS) and marketing strategies employ for these services in Nigerian Universities. Design/methodology/approach: Case study research approach was explored. The <b>university</b> <b>libraries</b> websites were analysed, email and telephone {{interviews were conducted}} with the System Librarians in charge of DIS. Findings – The DIS in <b>university</b> <b>libraries</b> in Nigeria are on the increase compared with what it was three years ago. The available DIS are CD-ROM, Internet Search, open access institutional repositories (OAIR), E-resources, E-books, E-journals, Online Reference Services, and computer laboratory. The marketing strategies employ for DIS by <b>university</b> <b>libraries</b> in Nigeria are users’ orientation, demonstration, exhibition, display, email messages, telephone, library websites, word of mouth during the departmental/faculty meetings, and selective packaging of relevant information to users. Most of DIS are offered free of charge to registered users. Research limitations/implications: The sample for this study is six <b>university</b> <b>libraries</b> out of one hundred and twenty-eight <b>university</b> <b>libraries</b> in Nigeria, thus the findings might not be genaralised. However the results provide a basis for <b>university</b> <b>libraries</b> in Nigeria. Practical implications – <b>University</b> <b>libraries</b> should see marketing as a tool needed by library and thus, should employ suitable marketing strategies to attract users’ to make maximum use of available DIS. Originality/value – This paper examines marketing strategies and mix that are suitable for information services. It also identifies digital information services and marketing strategies employ by the <b>university</b> <b>libraries</b> in Nigeria and relevant recommendations made...|$|R
