50|$|Many U.S. based {{companies}} have not removed {{the glass ceiling}} from their organizations. Although some companies already have set an example of some practices and ways this can be achieved {{there are many different}} other ways of removing the glass ceiling at a company-wide level. Many ways of removing the glass ceiling from {{companies have}} already been mentioned in the latter section, but some ways of removing the glass ceiling have not been implemented yet. The strategy is called a clear plan of action between the employee and the employer. This plan calls for an <b>upper-level</b> <b>manager</b> to act as a mentor and to help create achievable goals within the company with an employee. This will help remove the glass ceiling in two ways. One, that the employers and the employee have a mutual understanding of what each wants and want to achieve. Two, that the employee can visualize and work for a specific set our goal, and once accomplishing the said goal, {{to move on to the}} next goal. By doing this, the company will see the dedication and highly motivated employee striving to achieve upper-level positions and therefore, in theory, promote the employee regardless of gender and background.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} competence, likeability, and sex of an <b>upper-level</b> <b>manager</b> {{on his or}} her {{performance}} evaluation and the work relationship with his or her subordinates were examined in the present study. Given that women in leadership positions are frequent victims of prejudice and discrimination, it was of a particular interest to examine how female managers would be evaluated. In a survey of 228 undergraduate students, competence was found to be an important attribute when it came to performance evaluation, whereas likeability was found to be an important attribute {{when it came to the}} work relationship. Female managers were found not to be necessarily devalued; when women managers were clearly described as competent, they were evaluated more positively than their male counterparts, regardless of their likeability levels. The results of the present study indicate that competence and likeability are more important attributes than sex to determine performance evaluation and the work relationship between supervisor and subordinate...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} an analysis of empirical data on ethical attitudes of profes-sionals and managers in relation to organizational core values in the Information Technology (IT) industry. This study investigates the association between key organizational values as independent variables and the ethical attitudes of IT managers as dependent variables. The study also delves into differences among IT non-managerial professionals, mid-level <b>managers,</b> and <b>upper-level</b> <b>managers</b> in their ethical attitudes and perceptions. Research results indicated that IT professionals from mechanistic organizations {{were much more likely to}} report – compared to those from organic organizations – that managers in their corporate environment engage in behaviors considered unethical and that successful managers were more unethical relative to unsuccessful managers. There were significant differences between the <b>upper-level</b> <b>managers</b> and the mid-level managers and between the mid-level managers and the IT non-managerial professionals on certain key ethical issues. This paper discusses the conceptual framework, hypotheses, research methodology, data analysis, impli-cations of the findings, and suggested areas of further research...|$|R

40|$|The {{exception}} {{principle of}} management reporting suggests that, under ordinary conditions, operational staff persons make decisions, {{but that the}} same staff refer decisions to <b>upper-level</b> <b>managers</b> under exceptional conditions.

Seasonality estimates in univariate forecast models and leading independent variables in multivariate forecast models are among the approaches to forecasting exceptional demand, a forecast activity that this paper identifies as requiring new accuracy measures based on the tails of sampled forecast error distributions, rather than conventional measures which use the central tendency. For this purpose, the paper introduces {{the application of the}} receiver operating characteristic (ROC) framework, which has been used for the assessment of exceptional behavior in many fields.

40|$|As {{businesses}} {{strive to}} improve operations and streamline workflow, managers {{are expected to}} motivate employees towards giving a greater commitment to {{the goals of the}} employer. This in turn affects the implementation of strategic initiatives by upper management. Employees on the frontlines can be a valuable asset when collecting data on strategic initiatives by managers (Meers, 2007). Mathis and Jackson (2006) indicate three distinct advantages in using employees to rate managers. The first is the identification of competent managers. The second advantage comes in motivating managers to become responsive to the employee and finally, managers may use the information to aid in career development by identifying areas of needed growth. The challenge lies in getting employees to accurately rate motivational activities of management for their effectiveness and overall influence on the worker. There are several ways to accomplish this task; however, the use of the multisource or 360 ° job performance rating system is on the rise in many organizations (Conway & Huffcutt, 1997).

50|$|The {{government}} made minimal {{efforts to prevent}} trafficking or increase the public’s awareness of trafficking risks in FSM and the region during the reporting period. Evidence and anecdotal reports suggest that the current number of internal or transnational trafficking victims is relatively low; the government’s limited resources were thus often directed to meet more emergent priorities. Immigration authorities claim to look for evidence of trafficking at ports of entry. <b>Upper-level</b> <b>managers</b> at the Division of Immigration and Labor attended seminars that discussed trafficking. The government did initiate anti-trafficking training for new police recruits {{in the last two}} police academy classes. In May 2009, the former FSM Ambassador to the United States was convicted of selling sample FSM passports maintained at the Embassy in Washington D.C. for personal financial gain, and sentenced to 30 months’ imprisonment and a fine. Although authorities have not yet shown that the case clearly involved the transnational movement of trafficking victims, the former Ambassador was facilitating the illegal cross-border movement of irregular migrants from populations throughout the region that are consistently identified as trafficking victims. FSM supports no anti-trafficking task forces or working groups. The government conducted no campaigns aimed at reducing the demand for commercial sex acts.

The problem {{of this study was to}} describe the verbal communication patterns of bank managers and to determine if differences exist among these communication patterns based on the bank in which the managers were employed, gender, managerial level, and length of employment. The following variables described the communication patterns: frequency, number of persons, internal persons, external persons, departments, place, medium, content, and purpose. The sample consisted of 54 managers representing two banks. The self-recording method was used to gather the communication pattern data. Two days a week for a month, the managers recorded their communication on forms hourly at designated, even intervals. Managers' verbal communication patterns were described as follows. They verbally communicated in 69 % of the total recordings. They communicated most frequently with one other person, with subordinates, in unscheduled meetings, while in their offices, and to send/receive task information. The managers communicated with persons from other departments during a third of their episodes but seldom communicated with persons external to the banks. They communicated about the same number of times during each hour of the workday and each day of the workweek. With the use of the Chi Square statistical test, nine null hypotheses were tested to determine if significant differences in managers' verbal communication patterns existed. The first four hypotheses were rejected since significant differences occurred in the communication patterns of (1) the two banks' managers, (2) male and female managers; (3) lower-, middle-, and <b>upper-level</b> <b>managers,</b> and (4) managers employed for various numbers of years. The five interactional null hypotheses involving two variables, gender and management level, were also rejected. Differences existed in the communication patterns of (1) lower-level male and female managers; (2) middle-level male and female managers; (3) upper-level male and female managers; (4) lower-, middle-, and upper-level male managers; and (5) lower-, middle-, and <b>upper-level</b> female <b>managers.</b> However, level differences were more dominant than gender differences. The data from this study should be used by business educators to incorporate relevant verbal communication activities into their curricula and should be used by corporate training departments to specialize the communication training of managers...|$|R

40|$|Based on Bayer and Gerstein's (1988 a) Bystander-Equity Model of Supervisory Helping Behavior, {{this study}} {{examined}} the relationship between characteristics of Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs), supervisors, workers, and the EAP referral process. These theorists suggest that individual and environmental variables interact in a dynamic fashion and that one result of this process is a management-initiated EAP referral. Specifically, it was hypothesized that managerial status, type of troubled worker, and EAP location would affect supervisors' likelihood to refer hypothetical impaired employees to an EAP. Graduate students (N = 222) were asked to imagine themselves as supervisors (upper, middle, or front-line) employed by a fictitious manufacturing firm. They were also asked to imagine that they were responsible for some hypothetical workers described in a set of scenarios. Each participant received one of three sets of scenarios (cocaine abuser, alcohol abuser, or job-impaired worker). Additionally, half of the participants were told that their EAP was corporately owned and company-based, and that the personnel were employees of the firm. The other half were told that their EAP was contracted-out to independent practitioners (i. e., not employees of the company), and that the program was community-based. Upon review of each scenario, respondents were asked to indicate their likelihood (OZ- 100 %) of referring a particular hypothetical employee to their fictitious EAP. Results of an ANOVA revealed no significant interactions. As expected, however, two main effects for type of substance abuse and managerial level were found. Participants were more likely to refer cocaine abusers to an EAP than alcohol or non-substance abusing hypothetical employees. Referral rates were also found to be higher for alcohol abusing workers as compared to non-substance abusers. Additionally, it was discovered that front-line managers were more likely to make referrals as contrasted with <b>upper-level</b> <b>managers.</b> There was no effect found for the location of the EAP. Based on these findings a number of theoretical explanations were offered as were empirical and programmitic implications. Limitations of this project were discussed in terms of the analogue methodology, the single dependent measure (i. e., likelihood to refer), the stimulus materials, and the sample population used.

40|$|The {{fabric of}} the {{workforce}} is changing. Indeed, domestic managers are working with an increasingly multicultural workforce at home while managers who travel abroad often work with people from multiple cultures. Concurrently, managers are often required {{to work with people}} in organizations that span across geographic boundaries, located in various time zones, relying mainly on information technology. However, empirical guidelines to train managers facing these challenges are scant as management typologies fall short when it comes to identifying the skills needed for simultaneously working with people from multiple cultural backgrounds. The goal {{of this study was to}} identify a repertoire of multicultural managerial competencies for work at home and abroad, in face-to-face contexts and via the use of technology. Using competency modeling as a conceptual framework, we enlisted the help of 20 mid- to <b>upper-level</b> <b>managers</b> who were invited to participate in individual behavioral event interviews to discuss positive and negative critical incidents and to answer questions grounded in job analysis. Data was analyzed using thematic (content) analysis based on a mixed method, a process that mostly illustrated the emergence of new competencies. ATLAS. ti was then used to code transcripts and to cross-reference behaviors according to emerging competency categories. Managers were then invited to validate the relevance of the initial version of the typology and to confirm that no competencies or related behaviors were missing. The resulting Multicultural Managerial Competency (MMC) typology, outlining five competence categories that combine 12 competencies along with their 71 corresponding behavioral indicators, makes both theoretical and practical contributions while offering flexibility for application. Indeed, the MMC typology illustrates an overlap between management and intercultural/cross-cultural literature, confirming that managers in multicultural contexts are called upon to invest in the management of trusting relationships, in distance management, as well as in expatriate management. Multicultural elements also permeate classic business and team functions thereby giving management requirements a new form. In terms of practical applications, the MMC typology provides concrete behavioral indicators for managers to use as guidelines for competence and serves to inform the creation of university curricula in international management...|$|R

In a similar study by Eagly & Karau (2002), because of male-manager stereotypes, women are seen as less likely to fit managerial roles and, as a result, when they do achieve those positions, are looked on less favorably when performing the same managerial duties.|$|R
40|$|Following {{the success}} of {{overseas}} investment by multinational corporations, many firms will begin to transform their strategy from one of global integration to one of localization, which will incrementally deepen their ties to the local market. However, a significant characteristic of Taiwanese overseas investment is it's creation of “intra-industry trade. ” Upon entering the foreign market firms will continue to purchase raw materials and components from their Taiwanese midstream and upstream providers. This {{can be seen as}} an extension of long-term cooperative relationships. Based in this logic, this research attempts to understand the degree of dependence of Taiwanese subsidiaries on their parent company's resources and skills to discover whether or not this creates a lock-in effect which will influence {{the success of}} localization of Taiwanese firms in China. Furthermore, using the industrial environment of Chinese businesses as a base, this research will analyze the influence of network relationships and industry environment on degree of localization and internationalization performance. Based on the above motivation, this research has three goals. First, to understand whether the localization of Taiwanese businesses in China is influenced by their original networks when such firms internationalize through their network. Second, to understand the role of industrial environment in internationalization and its influence on the localization of Taiwanese firms in China. Third, to analyze the relationship between localization of Taiwanese firms and internationalization performance, including financial performance, operational performance and market performance. This research focused on Taiwanese firms in the electronic manufacturing industry using FDI modes to enter China. Respondents were chosen from a list of firms selected from the Investment Commission, MOEA and complemented with the Taiwan Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers Association (TEEMA) membership list. 800 questionnaires were sent and eighty-seven useable questionnaires were returned for a return rate of 10. 8 %. Respondents were General Managers, managers or procurement department <b>upper-level</b> <b>managers.</b> Results revealed that (1) there is a negative relationship between the lock-in effect of networks and localization, (2) there is a positive relationship between environment and localization and (3) there is a positive relationship between localization and internationalization performance. 基於跨國企業海外投資的發展經驗，企業會隨著國際化進程，由全球化策略轉為當地化策略，故當地化會逐漸深化。然而，台商在對外投資所產生的「產業內貿易」(intra-industry trade) 為一個重要特徵，當進入海外市場之後，仍接續向台灣的中、上游供應商購買原物料及零組件，此現象屬於長期合作關係的延伸。因此，本研究欲了解台商對母國資源與技術的高度依賴，是否會產生鎖入效果(lock-in effect) ，影響台商在大陸發展當地化的程度。此外，並加入大陸當地產業環境因素，探討網絡關係、產業環境兩者之於當地化程度與國際化績效之關係。 緣上動機，本研究目的為：(一) 探討藉由本土企業網絡關係進行國際化時，台商在大陸市場的當地化程度是否受原先網絡關係之影響。(二) 探討產業環境在國際化過程中所扮演的角色，及其對台商在大陸市場當地化程度之影響。(三) 分析台商當地化程度與國際化績效之間的關係，包括財務績效、營運績效和市場績效。 本研究以台灣直接投資大陸的電機電子製造業為研究對象，抽樣對象主要採用「經濟部投資審議委員會」中之企業，並輔以台灣區電機電子工業同業公會會員名單(2004 年) ，共寄發 800 份問卷，共回收有效問卷 87 份，有效樣本回收率為 10. 8 %。受測對象為(副) 總經理、經(副) 理、或採購等高階主管。實證結果發現：(一) 網絡關係之鎖入效果對當地化程度的負向影響並不顯著。(二) 產業環境對當地化程度具有正向顯著影響。(三) 當地化程度對國際化績效具有正向顯著影響。目次 目次		iii 表目次		iv 圖目次		v 第一章	緒論	 1 第一節	研究背景與研究動機	 1 第二節	研究問題與研究目的	 2 第三節	研究流程	 4 第二章	文獻探討	 5 第一節	我國對中國大陸投資概況	 5 第二節	網絡關係	 7 第三節	產業環境	 10 第四節	當地化	 11 第五節	國際化績效	 15 第三章	研究方法	 18 第一節	研究架構	 18 第二節	研究假說	 19 第三節	操作型定義與衡量	 21 第四節	研究設計	 24 第五節	資料分析方法	 27 第四章	資料分析與實證研究	 29 第一節	敘述性統計分析	 29 第二節	抽樣誤差檢定	 35 第三節	項目分析	 36 第四節	因素分析	 37 第五節	信度與效度分析	 41 第六節	Pearson相關分析	 47 第七節	假說檢定	 47 第五章	結論與建議	 51 第一節	研究結論	 51 第二節	研究貢獻與實務建議	 54 第三節	研究限制與後續研究建議 57 參考文獻	 59 附錄 研究問卷	 6...|$|R
40|$|Leader-member {{exchange}} (LMX) differentiation, {{the extent}} to which the leader forms different quality exchange relationships with group members, is the fundamental premise of LMX theory. The present study tests whether, why, and when LMX differentiation increases group outcomes. More specifically, I suggest a dual perspective model of LMX differentiation and group effectiveness, which includes both leaders 2 ̆ 7 and members 2 ̆ 7 perspectives on LMX differentiation. To explicate the effects of leader- and member-rated LMX differentiation on group effectiveness, I delineate two group processes (task and socio-emotional processes) to link LMX differentiation to two aspects of group effectiveness (group performance and group viability). I propose that leader-rated LMX differentiation increases group performance via task group processes (group role clarity and group coordination) whereas member-rated LMX differentiation decreases group viability via socio-emotional processes (relationship conflict and group potency). Furthermore, I propose moderators (distributed expertise, leader-leader exchange, leader prototypicality, and group power distance) suggesting when leader-rated LMX differentiation relates to task group processes more strongly and positively, and when member-rated LMX differentiation relates to socio-emotional group processes less strongly and negatively. Survey data, based on the US and South Korean employees working in 57 teams, were collected from three different sources (group leaders, members, and <b>upper-level</b> <b>managers)</b> at two points in time (with 3 -month time lag). Results revealed three important findings: (a) leader-rated LMX differentiation is positively correlated with group role clarity, group coordination, and group potency and negatively correlated with relationship conflict, (b) group mean member LMX and group mean leader LMX were more robustly, positively related to most group process and effectiveness variables, and (c) leader prototypicality moderates the relationship between member-rated LMX differentiation and relationship conflict such that the negative relationship is significant only when members perceptions of leader prototypicality was high. The present study contributes to the LMX and team leadership literature by (a) providing a theoretical framework of a dual perspective to understand the LMX differentiation-group effectiveness relationship at the group level, (b) providing empirical evidence showing that leader-rated LMX differentiation is positively related to some group processes although these relationships were not significant when controlling for group mean LMX, (c) finding that the leaders 2 ̆ 7 and members 2 ̆ 7 perspectives on LMX differentiation are not highly correlated, and (d) emphasizing the role of leader prototypicality in understanding the effect of member-rated LMX differentiation at the group level. Based upon these findings, I suggest future research directions such as ways to improve measurement and operationalization of LMX differentiation, development of a theoretical model explaining the low level of LMX agreement between members and leaders, and examining LMX differentiation in broader contexts (e. g., HR systems or strategy and cultural contexts) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this Master's Thesis is to {{discover}} if operative-level staff members perceptions of internal communication in a company are associated with {{their perceptions of the}} company s managers. The empirical data has been collected through qualitative research interviews with six operative-level staff members and the manager of the Internal Communication Department in a company named Société des Transports Intercommunaux de Bruxelles (STIB) in Belgium for the purpose of writing my Bachelor thesis in 2004. STIB is a public service organization that runs public transportation (metro, tramway, and bus) in the area of Brussels, in Belgium and employs about 6000 individuals. The interviews were made in French in autumn 2004. This study explores the following research question: "Are there associations between operative-level staff members perceptions of internal communication at STIB and their perceptions of the company s managers?" In order to answer the above mentioned research question, this study describes and compares how operative-level staff members perceive internal communication at STIB and how they perceive managers at STIB. Moreover, these perceptions are analysed through Clampitt and Downs (1993) Communication Satisfaction Categories. When considering the results of this research, it can be concluded that there are similarities between the way operative-level staff members perceive internal communication at STIB and the way they assess managers. It seems that when communication is assessed in a positive way, managers who are considered {{to be involved in the}} communication process are assessed in a positive way as well. Negative assessment of communication is associated with negative assessment of those managers who are perceived as being involved in the specific communication process evaluated. It could be added that the more specific the information transmitted is, the more it is associated with the perception of closer managers. Consequently, the positive assessment of information concerning specific job requirements as well as specific rules is similar with the positive assessment of direct-line managers. The negative assessment of transmission of downward communication and information that is more general and relates to more general decisions and rules is associated with the negative perception of middle-level managers. Finally, the perceived lack of horizontal and overall communication in the organization seems to be associated with negative perception of the <b>upper-level</b> <b>managers</b> and the CEO of the company.

40|$|Managerial work is disorderly, {{fragmented}} and hectic (Antonioni, 1996; Fogarty et al., 1999; Hooijberg et al., 1997; Mintzberg, 1973; Yukl, 1989). According to Mintzberg (1973), the typical manager is simultaneously a (a) figurehead, leader and liaison (interpersonal role), (b) disseminator, monitor and spokesman (informational role); and entrepreneur, disturbance handler, negotiator and resource allocator (decisional role). Given the multifaceted {{nature of their}} work, managers {{are expected to be}} goal-oriented, motivated and, most importantly, 'stress-tolerant' (Lusch and Serpkenci, 1990). While there is some research to suggest that occupational stress is more prevalent at shopfloor level than at management level (see, e. g., Karasek and Theorell, 1990), a recent survey found that the incidence of occupational stress in managers was as high as 70 per cent (Wheatley, 2000). Managers encounter a high pressure environment on a day-to-day basis (Ducharme, 2004), with the constant need for 'fire fighting' contributing to a cumulative effect on stress. Are managers themselves part of the problem? Wheatley (2000) argued that many managers make their jobs more stressful by doing them badly: they not only feel unable to cope, but are unable to cope. Hogan and Kaiser (2005) argued that managers who rise {{to the top of the}} corporate ladder are distinguished by ambition, hard work, intelligence, luck and political skill but not necessarily by 'leadership talent'; many fail because they are simply unable to make the transition. The base rate for managerial incompetence is in the range of 30 per cent to 75 per cent (Hogan and Kaiser, 2005). Hogan and Warrenfeltz (2003) argued that managerial competence can be captured in terms of four broad types of skills: (1) intrapersonal skills (e. g. self-awareness and self-regulation); (2), interpersonal skills (e. g. cooperating, communicating, conflict resolution, empathizing, listening, providing encouragement and support, sensitivity and tact); (3) business/management skills (e. g. budgeting, coordinating, following up, decision making, monitoring, organizing, planning, problem solving, scheduling); and (4) leadership skills (building teamwork, developing people, driving accountability and performance, securing commitment not just compliance, strategic planning and visioning). Reducing distress and dysfunction in managers is vital to the health and performance of the organization as a whole (Quick et al., 1996; Schreurs et al., 1996). Distressed and dysfunctional managers may affect company image, morale, organizational climate and productivity, as well as the rate of sick leave and medical consumption (Schreurs et al., 1996). For instance, supervisor satisfaction is a major determinant of overall job satisfaction, with up to 75 per cent of employees rating their immediate supervisor as the worst aspect of their jobs (Hogan and Kaiser, 2005). Furthermore, managers may directly affect the development of other people within the organization, such as their direct reports (Ducharme, 2004). This chapter should assist HR professionals, consultants and senior managers in implementing personnel selection, job assignment, training and professional development for middle- to <b>upper-level</b> <b>managers</b> whose jobs entail staff management. Key terms used throughout the chapter (stress, stressor, strain, occupational stress, fit) are defined below. Limitations of past research on personality and occupational stress are then considered, focusing on the neglect of an idiographic approach examining the interaction between different levels of personality (i. e. motives and traits). Next, the relationship between motives and managerial styles is examined. The expression of motives through goals and traits is discussed before presenting a motive-trait taxonomy of adaptive and maladaptive managerial styles. Finally, strategies for managing maladaptive managerial styles through intervention (e. g. stress education, stress management training) and prevention (e. g. personnel selection, job assignment) are presented...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{examine the effect of}} accountability, {{organizational}} factors, and the use of performance measurement system on organizational performance, particularly educational organizations in the form of private Catholic universities. Mixed method with sequential explanatory strategy is used in this study to collect and to analyze data. In the quantitative stages, data from 159 respondents of <b>upper-level</b> and mid-level <b>managers</b> at Catholic universities is collected through questionnaire and is then analyzed using SEM-PLS. Furthermore, content analysis technique was used to analyze transcript of interview in the qualitative stages. The results indicate that there is an effect of accountability and a clear and measurable perception of goals on the improvement of university’s performance. This study has practical implications in supporting the government to create a system of accountability and good governance for universities. For private Catholic universities, this research shows that regulations or legislations required by the government are factors that encourage improvement of performance and governance of universities. For the association coordinating private Catholic universities (APTIK), this study can be a reference in developing and strengthening cooperation among the private Catholic universities...|$|R
