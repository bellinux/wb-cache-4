This advantage enhances its stability and ability to protect the skin from ultraviolet light. Nano-scaled (particle size of 30–40nm) titanium dioxide particles are primarily used in sun screen lotion because they scatter visible light less than titanium dioxide pigments while still providing <b>UV</b> <b>protection.</b> Sunscreens designed for infants or people with sensitive skin are often based on titanium dioxide and/or zinc oxide, as these mineral UV blockers are believed to cause less skin irritation than other UV absorbing chemicals.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Effects of {{ultraviolet}} radiation on the skin, {{the eyes and}} the immune system are well known. The need for <b>UV</b> radiation <b>protection</b> is popularized {{by the introduction of}} UV index. Uneven intensity of UV radiation in different regions in different periods of the year and in different times of the day requires that recommendations for <b>UV</b> radiation <b>protection</b> are given for possible UV index values in those regions. Objective. The aim of the study is to establish a simple and consistent method for the determination of the need for <b>UV</b> radiation <b>protection</b> in Serbia where UV radiation intensity can be approximated as uniform. Methods. Possible values of UV index during the year and the sun elevation during the day in periods throughout the year were used for the determination of maximal possible UV index values. These values were compared to UV index forecasts regarding <b>UV</b> radiation <b>protection.</b> Results. Maximal possible values for UV index were used for producing the colour graph. Colours on the graph indicate the need for <b>UV</b> radiation <b>protection.</b> Green - protection is not needed, yellow - protection is needed, red - protection is obligatory. Comparisons with the need for protection based on forecasts showed congruence in 97 % of cases. Conclusion. The use of the graph for the determination of the need for <b>UV</b> radiation <b>protection</b> gives nearly the same results as recommendations based on UV index forecasts. The advantages of the graph are that it gives recommendations for the whole year, for the time intervals during the day in every period of the year and for the whole territory of Serbia...|$|R

50|$|Ultraviolet UV-A and UV-B {{radiation}} is harmful to living systems. An important tool used {{to deal with}} UV exposure is the biosynthesis of small-molecule sunscreens. Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) have been implicated in <b>UV</b> radiation <b>protection.</b> The genetic basis for this implication comes from the observed induction of MAA synthesis when organisms are exposed to UV radiation (between 280-400 nm). Among many different organisms, this observation has occurred in aquatic yeasts, cyanobacteria, marine dinoflagellates, and some Antarctic diatoms. When MAAs absorb UV light the energy is dissipated as heat.

40|$|INTRODUCTION UV Index is an {{indicator}} of human exposure to solar ultraviolet (UV) rays. The numerical values of the UV Index range from 1 - 11 and above. There are three levels of <b>protection</b> against <b>UV</b> radiation; low values of the <b>UV</b> Index - <b>protection</b> is not required, medium values of the <b>UV</b> Index - <b>protection</b> is recommended and high values of the <b>UV</b> Index - <b>protection</b> is obligatory. The value of the UV Index primarily depends on the elevation {{of the sun and}} total ozone column. OBJECTIVE The aim of the study is to determine the intervals of possible maximal annual values of the UV Index in Serbia {{in order to determine the}} necessary level of protection in a simple manner. METHOD For maximal and minimal expected values of total column ozone and for maximal elevation of the sun, the value of the UV Index was determined for each month in the Northern and Southern parts of Serbia. These values were compared with the forecast of the UV Index. RESULTS Maximal clear sky values of the UV Index in Serbia for altitudes up to 500 m in May, June, July and August can be 9 or even 10, and not less than 5 or 6. During November, December, January and February the UV Index can be 4 at most. During March, April, September and October the expected values of the UV Index are maximally 7 and not less than 3. The forecast of the UV Index is within these limits in 98 % of comparisons. CONCLUSION The described method of determination of possible UV Index values showed a high agreement with forecasts.

40|$|Abstract. Ceria (CeO 2) nanopowders doped {{with various}} Zinc (Zn) {{compositions}} were synthesized from solution by irradiating ultrasound waves. Ultrasound waves were irradiated to aqueous/isopropanol solution of cerium nitrate and zinc nitrate mixtures. Aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide was droped into that solution until pH becomes 10. Dried precipitates were calcined at 100 oC to form CeO 2 nanopowders. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis shows the CeO 2 nanopowder possess fluorite cubic structure. Ultrasound irradiation resulted in nano-metric powder of CeO 2 with spherical in shape. The addition of Zn into CeO 2 reduces the particle size and shows strong absorbance in the ultra–violet (UV) region.
