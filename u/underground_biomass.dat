50|$|Reasons for {{decline of}} mangroves, seagrass, and marshes include land use changes, climate and drought related effects, dams {{built in the}} watershed, {{convergence}} to aquaculture and agriculture, land development and sea-level rise due to climate change. Increases in these activities can lead to significant decreases in habitat available and thus increases in released C from sediments. As anthropogenic effects and climate change are heightened, the effectiveness of blue carbon sinks will diminish and CO2 emissions will be further increased. Data on the rates at which CO2 is being released into the atmosphere is not robust currently, however research is being conducted to gather a better information to analyze trends.

50|$|Marshes, {{intertidal}} ecosystems {{dominated by}} herbaceous vegetation, {{can be found}} globally on coastlines from the arctic to the subtropics. In the tropics, marshes are replaced by mangroves as the dominant coastal vegetation. Marshes have high productivity, with {{a large portion of}} primary production in belowground biomass. This belowground biomass can form deposits up to 8m deep. Marshes provide valuable habitat for plants, birds, and juvenile fish, protect coastal habitat from storm surge and flooding, and can reduce nutrient loading to coastal waters. Similarly to mangrove and seagrass habitats, marshes also serve as important carbon sinks. Marshes sequester C in <b>underground</b> <b>biomass</b> due to high rates of organic sedimentation and anaerobic-dominated decomposition. Salt marshes cover approximately 22,000 to 400,000 km2 globally, with an estimated carbon burial rate of 210 g C m−2 yr−1. Tidal marshes have been impacted by humans for centuries, including modification for grazing, haymaking, reclamation for agriculture, development and ports, evaporation ponds for salt production, modification for aquaculture, insect control, tidal power and flood protection. Marshes are also susceptible to pollution from oil, industrial chemicals, and most commonly, eutrophication. Introduced species, sea-level rise, river damming and decreased sedimentation are additional longterm changes that affect marsh habitat, and in turn, may affect carbon sequestration potential.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Climate {{change is}} one of the most {{important}} challenges in sustainable development which has negative effect on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem. The lead factor of this phenomenon is Co 2 accumulation in atmosphere. One of the suitable ways of facing the mentioned issue is carbon sequestration in plant biomass and soil as a simple as well as inexpensive refined way in rangelands. With respect to the fact that Artemisia lands occupy an extensive part of the rangelands in Iran, in order to investigate the role of Artemisia lands in carbon sequestration, an area of Artemisia sieberi vegetation type in Hamadan province was selected and the content of aboveground and <b>underground</b> <b>biomass</b> carbon and soil organic carbon was determined. The result showed that the total carbon sequestration per hectare was 287. 49 kg/ha and 90 % of total carbon sequestration was soil organic carbon. The results of biomass carbon distribution showed that the carbon content in aerial biomass was more than <b>underground</b> <b>biomass.</b> Among the different parts of aerial biomass, the greatest storage was related to foliage carbon. Within proper range management in rangeland ecosystems, a major step forward in rising plant biomass could be taken.

5000|$|Historically {{the ocean}} and {{terrestrial}} forest ecosystems have been the major natural carbon (C) sinks. New research {{on the role of}} vegetated coastal ecosystems have highlighted their potential as highly efficient C sinks, and led to the scientific recognition of the term [...] "Blue Carbon". [...] "Blue Carbon" [...] designates carbon that is fixed via ocean and coastal ecosystems, rather than traditional land ecosystems, like forests. Although the ocean’s vegetated habitats cover less than 0.5% of the seabed, they are responsible for more than 50%, and potentially up to 70%, of all carbon storage in ocean sediments. Mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses make up the majority of the ocean’s vegetated habitats but only equal 0.05% of the plant biomass on land. Despite their small footprint, they can store a comparable amount of carbon per year and are highly efficient carbon sinks. Seagrasses, mangroves and salt marshes can capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere by sequestering the C in their underlying sediments, in <b>underground</b> and below-ground <b>biomass,</b> and in dead biomass. In plant biomass such as leaves, stems, branches or roots, blue carbon can be sequestered for years to decades, and for thousands to millions of years in underlying plant sediments. Current estimates of long-term blue carbon C burial capacity are variable, and research is ongoing. Although vegetated coastal ecosystems cover less area and have less aboveground biomass than terrestrial plants they have the potential to impact longterm C sequestration, particularly in sediment sinks. One of the main concerns with Blue Carbon is the rate of loss of these important marine ecosystems is much higher than any other ecosystem on the planet, even compared to rainforests. Current estimates suggest a loss of 2-7% per year, which is not only lost carbon sequestration, but also lost habitat that is important for managing climate, coastal protection, and health.|$|R

As plantas foram cultivadas em vasos nos meses de março a agosto de 2005 e submetidas a uma combinação de altura (2 e 8 cm) e freqüência de corte (semanal, quinzenal e mensal) durante 141 dias. Não houve diferença quanto à produção da matéria seca (MS) aérea sob cortes semanais e quinzenais. Com cortes mensais, a população Crioula-EL, com maior altura e quantidade de hastes, superou as demais. Os cultivares Alfagraze e Crioula-EC foram similares quanto à quantidade de MS subterrânea. As populações de alfafa diferiram na resposta ao {{manejo de}} corte e apresentaram declínio gradual na MS quando submetidas a cortes mais freqüentes, com maior sobrevivência do cultivar Alfagraze em comparação aos cultivares Crioula-EC e Crioula-EL. O cultivar Alfagraze diferiu das populações do cultivar Crioula e apresentou menor altura, maior diâmetro, maior proporção de hastes da coroa e maior alocação de MS na parte subterrânea, portanto, estas características estão relacionadas ao tipo-pastejo. O comprimento do entrenó da plântula poderia ser utilizado complementarmente para selecionar populações de alfafa com maior aptidão ao pastejo, o que torna possível obter populações com variabilidade de produção de matéria seca e sobrevivência.

The trial was performed in pots, between February and August/ 2005. The populations were harvest at two cutting intensities (2 and 8 cm) and three cutting frequencies (weekly, fortnightly and monthly) during 141 days. There was no difference on shoot dry matter (DM) yield between weekly and fortnightly cuttings; the Crioula-EL, under monthly cuttings was the tallest and had higher amount of stems, surpassing the others. There was similarity between the cultivar Alfagraze and Crioula-SI regarding <b>underground</b> DM <b>biomass.</b> Alfalfa populations responded differently to defoliation management, with a gradual decline on DM yield under more frequent cuttings and a higher survival of plants from Alfagraze compared to Crioula-EC and Crioula-EC.

Some features of change of specific net primary production (SNPP) of forest–forming species in Eurasia in the transcontinental gradients are shown for the first time using the voluminous factual material. SNPP represents the ratio of net primary production (NPP) to biomass and is expressed in relative units or percentage (by analogy with the percentage of the current stem volume increment that is used in traditional forest mensuration). An overview of methods and results of studying the percentage of the current stem volume increment and relationships between NPP and biomass involving into SNPP as the numerator and the denominator correspondingly is given. The database on biomass and NPP of forest ecosystems (t/ha) in a number of 920 definitions for 2 -needled pines (subgenus Pinus), 116 – for larches (Larix Mill.), 480 – for spruce-fir forests (Picea Dietr., and Abies Mill.) and 230 definitions for birch forests (Betula L.) on the territory from Britain to South China is compiled. Using multiple regression analysis technique, the statistically significant changes in SNPP of aboveground, <b>underground</b> and understorey <b>biomass</b> according to two transcontinental gradients, namely by zonal belts and continentality of climate, are stated. The age dynamics of different species SNPP has a common pattern of decline with the age of a tree stand, but various quantitative parameters. Regularities of SNPP change according to zonal belts and in relation to the index of climate continentality are statistically significant, but substantial differences between woody species are found, to explain that is not possible yet. Because the term SNPP means «the rate of the transformation of organic substances» or, in other terms, the intensity of nutrient cycling, one apparently must include into the formula for SNPP the current biomass quantity plus all its litter, timber and root falls during the given time period, instead of biomass stock taken from the database formed.

Our objective was to study the biomass responses of seedlings of a main secondary forest species, Quercus mongolica, to experimental warming and theinteraction of elevated CO 2 and different nitrogen regimes to provide insights into community development under a future warmer climate. Methods We used large growth chambers to determine short-term effects of elevated temperature (+ 4 °C) (ET) only and the combination of elevated CO 2 concentration (700 μmol CO 2 ·mol– 1) and elevated temperature (+ 4 °C) (ECET) under three different nitrogen regimes (15 mmol·L– 1 N (N 1), 7. 5 mmol·L– 1 N (N 2) and no added N in soil substrate (N 3)) on growth, biomass and its allocation in Q. mongolica seedlings. Important findings The ET and N 1 combination generally increased growth in height and diameter, as well as biomass accumulation of the seedlings. The allocation of <b>underground</b> <b>biomass</b> of seedlings increased with the increasing of N concentration. The ETEC and N 1 combination increased growth in height and <b>underground</b> <b>biomass</b> allocation of the seedlings, {{but there was no}} significant effect on diameter growth and total biomass of the seedlings. The C/N ratio of leaves increased with decreasing nitrogen supply, but the increases of C/N ratio under ECET was due to decreasing nitrogen concentration in the leaves and under ET was due to increasing carbon concentration in the leaves. No promotion of biomass accumulation was found under ECET and ET with lower nitrogen supply. So nitrogen supply will be an important factor with future climate change. Sufficient nitrogen supply may promote the growth of Q. mongolica seedlings, lead to changes in regeneration dynamics and increase their carbon stock under the future climate...|$|E
40|$|Common reed (Phragmites australis) is a {{prominent}} {{species in the}} upstream part of the eutrophic Scheldt estuary (Belgium, The Netherlands). From 1996 till 1998, seasonal growth dynamics of the species were studied in two monospecific stands subjected to different salinity regimes (seasonal means 1. 6 and 13. 3 PSU, respectively). We addressed the following questions: how are these reed vegetations affected by meteorological conditions and by the growth site, what are the important growth processes {{and what is the}} fate of the annually fixed carbon. A mathematical model was developed and calibrated using the data from the oligohaline site. Subsequent application of the model to the mesohaline stand required adaptation of parameters relating to the partitioning of resources and timing of growth initiation only. At their peak, the aboveground biomass was 587 - 1678 g DW m - 2 at the 13. 3 PSU site and 1116 - 2179 g DW m - 2 (1. 6 PSU); more than 60 % of the <b>biomass</b> was located <b>underground.</b> In 1996, <b>biomasses</b> were 2 - 3 times lower than in the other 2 years, caused by a retarded growth initiation. Probably due to a lower temperature in early 1996, rhizome bud burst occurred more than 1 month later compared to the other years. In addition, growth initiation was several weeks later in the mesohaline site. This appeared mainly responsible for the large difference in maximal aboveground biomass between both stations. Architecture of the plants was also affected, with a higher shoot density (about 50 % more shoots), better-developed root system (15 % of total belowground biomass compared to 5 %) and more, but smaller leaves at the higher salinity site. Notwithstanding large differences in aboveground biomass, annual growth was similar at both stations (154 and 132 mol C m - 2 per year at the oligo- and mesohaline station, respectively). Primary production accounted for about 80 % of all growth processes, rhizome remobilization for almost 20 %, translocation of mass before sloughing of leaves accounting about 3 %. Within a year, some 44 % (oligohaline) and 36 % (mesohaline) of new assimilates produced by photosynthesis accumulated as dead litter. The other part was respired by the plant itself, either to provide the energy for growth (23 %) or maintenance costs (33 - 41 % at the oligo- and mesohaline station, respectively).

Elevated water levels in the middle of the growing season caused a slowdown in growth in height and the creation of new shoots. Reduced water level of the mid-growing season seemed to faster growth of plants in height. <b>Underground</b> <b>biomass</b> significantly negatively affected by increased water level in the middle of the growing season...|$|E

40|$|Signatory {{countries}} of Kyoto Protocol {{are engaged in}} carrying out national inventories to quantify greenhouse gas emission and potentiality of C sinks. Forests represent the terrestrial ecosystem with the highest C sequestration capacity taking up CO 2 from the atmosphere and fixing it in vegetal biomass through photosynthesis process; C stocks can be divided in aboveground and belowground ones. In inventorial processes, root biomass is empirically extrapolated from aboveground biomass using a 0. 2 factor, which underestimate the real value. Some authors suggest that total underground C allocation can be assessed from the difference between annual respiration rate and litter fall. Belowground biomass can be divided in permanent biomass (structural roots) and temporary one (fine roots). Models allow a valuation of structural roots biomass from stand dendrometrical characteristics. Literature reveals that <b>underground</b> <b>biomass,</b> as fine roots than structural ones, highly varies with local conditions. The development of models that take into account these station parameters and therefore able to reproduce this variability seems to be obligatory to deal with inventory processes with an acceptable precision...|$|E
40|$|Pot {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} {{study the effects of}} biochar application rates (5, 10, 20 g/kg) and types of wheat straw biochar (WS), corn stalk biochar (CS) and peanut shell biochar (PS) on Suaeda salsa (S. salsa) growth and properties of saline soil in Yellow River Delta. It was found that S. salsa yield increased from 11. 7 to 115 % under WS application at a range of 5 - 10 g/kg compared with control. As biochar rate increased to 20 g/kg, the increment decreased to 102 %. The <b>underground</b> <b>biomass</b> of S. salsa only increased at 20 g/kg rate. The S. salsa growth respond to biochar followed the order of PS > WS > CS. Biochar application generally reduced saline soil pH and the effect was more obvious for WS. The content of total organic matter increased significantly at biochar rate of 10 - 20 g/kg. WS at higher application rate (20 g/kg) significantly increased available phosphorus content. At the same time, CS increased more available phosphorus content while PS decreased more of exchange sodium percentage. In generally, biochar application improved saline soil quality and enhanced plant growth although these effects should be tested in long-term period...|$|E
40|$|As well as {{worldwide}} {{the acceleration}} of extreme climate events, directly related to climate change, is observed in Georgia. The warming process is continuing, which may result in significant changes in forest expansion and forest diversity. Unfortunately these processes are already under way. In the present study we assessed the total biomass stocking in the pinewood cenosis in East Georgia and the carbon stock sequestered in it from the atmosphere. In Eastern Georgia pine-dominated forests make 66. 7 thousand hectares, thus amounting to 72. 6 % of pinewood in Georgia. The total biomass of pinewood cenosis makes 8. 74  Tg, where 4. 45  Tg of carbon (is sequestered. In the above-ground and <b>underground</b> <b>biomass</b> of the primary floor 3. 04  Tg are sequestered, in the shrub layer (underbrush, young plants) – 350. 8  Gg; in the herbaceous layer – 10. 4  Gg and in the forest floor there are 1. 05  Tg of carbon. Average annual growth of pinewood biomass makes up to 123. 7  Gg and annual carbon accumulation is 59. 6  Gg.

40|$|Abstract. For {{a better}} {{understanding}} of the dynamics of rehabilitated grassland, carbon storage in the underground including soil and roots were studied in a space series of replaced time courses. Soil organic carbon (SOC) of the 0 - 100 cm layer increased with the addition of restoration years. It was much more than the average of 4. 46 - 9. 95 kg m- 2 in central Plateau. SOC in surface soil (layer 0 - 20 cm) fell slightly in early stage (0 - 2 a) and then rose rapidly. In 30 a, the increase amplitude turned to be 123 % and it reached the maxmum. SOC in this layer was significantly correlated with an average value for the whole 0 - 100 cm profile. So SOC storage, in the 0 - 100 cm layer, can be well estimated using values for the 0 - 20 cm layer. Alfalfa <b>underground</b> <b>biomass</b> carbon storage rose first and then reduced. It reached the maxmum in 10 a. The carbon storage of weed roots increased continuously and was still less than that of alfalfa roots in 30 a...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to social}} and {{economic}} changes which {{have occurred in the}} last decades, many meadows located in mountain regions have ceased to be used. Abandonment of meadows leads to the degradation of their species composition. An example of degradation may be seen in the development of patches dominated by Calamagrostis epigejos. The aim of this research was to determine the influence of C. epigejos in its consecutive expansion stages on qualitative properties of meadow sward and on selected physico-chemical properties of soils. The study revealed strong degradation of mountain meadows due to the expansion of C. epigejos. The degradation manifested in a decrease in species diversity, a decline of species typical for mesic meadows, and an increased proportion of synanthropic species. The increase in aboveground biomass of C. epigejos strongly reduced the biomass of other species, while <b>underground</b> <b>biomass</b> had no effect on accompanying species. However, only a small impact of C. epigejos expansion on soil degradation was detected. The cumulating plant necromass dominated by this species caused a decrease in diversity indices and, at the same time, an increase in exchangeable forms of potassium and phosphorus in the soil...|$|E
40|$|Our study {{aimed at}} {{assessing}} {{the effects of}} 3 Plants Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) either singly or in com bination on maize growth under laboratory and greenhouse conditions. Seeds were inoculated with single and combined solution of 10 8 CFU/ml of Rhizobacteria. Seeds were not inoculated for the control variant. The highest germination percentage was obtained with the combination of Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas putida. This combination also recorded the best vigor index, plants circumferences number of leaves and the leaf area. The maximal heights of plants were observed with seeds treated with Azospirillum lipoferum with an increase of 37. 32 %. The highest rates of underground dry matter were recorded with A. lipoferum, with an increase of more than 56 % comparative to control, while the combination P. fluorescens and P. putida increased the aerial dry matter of 59. 11 %. Finally, the highest value of the aerial biomass was obtained with the plants treated with the combination of P. fluorescens and P. putida and the highest <b>underground</b> <b>biomass</b> w as obtained with plants treated only with A. lipoferum.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the biomechanical properties of the emergent aquatic macrophyte, Sparganium erectum. We present observations of adjustments in the physical characteristics and biomechanical properties of S. erectum during the growing season (April–November) from the River Blackwater, UK. When a pulling device is attached to plant stems to measure their resistance to uprooting, individual plants show remarkable strength in their above- and below-ground biomass (median stem strength when stems break away from the <b>underground</b> <b>biomass,</b> 78 N, median rhizome strength, 39 N) and high resistance to uprooting (median uprooting resistance when entire plants uproot, 114 N). This provides the potential for the species to protect and reinforce the generally soft, silty sediments that it often retains and within which its rhizomes and roots develop in lower energy river environments. There is a propensity for plant stems to break before the plant is uprooted {{at the beginning and end}} of the growth season, but for the stems to have sufficient strength in mid season for plant uprooting to dominate. This ensures that rhizome and root systems remain relatively undisturbed at times when the silty sediments in which they grow are poorly protected by above-ground biomass. In contrast, rhizome strength remains comparatively invariant through the growing season, supporting the plant's potential to have a protective/reinforcing effect on fine sediments through the winter when above ground biomass is absent...|$|E
40|$|The {{conversion}} of montane cloud forests into pastures for grazing cattle {{is the main}} cause of important impacts on rivers and streams in most of the Andes. In order to evaluate the effects of vegetation changes we need to understand water fluxes, particularly canopy interception. We measured net precipitation responses by the canopies of Pennisetum clandestinum Hochst. ex Chiov. and Melinis minutiflora Beauv. under simulated rainfall. The samples were taken from grazed pastures during 1 year, digging out round mats of grass, placing them on wire-mesh devices after eliminating soil and <b>underground</b> <b>biomass,</b> and irrigating with different water amounts. The resulting data allow us to present a validated model for each species that predicts percentage of interception at different precipitation intensities taking into account previous canopy wetness within determined biomass ranges. We use these models to estimate 2 years of interception values for pastures of both species in the upper watershed of El Cañadón, Capaz River, Venezuelan Andes. Mean annual precipitation of El Cañadón is 1244 mm and the estimate of pasture interception was 36. 5 % and 31. 8 % for P. clandestinum and M. minutiflora, respectively. Interception models, such as the ones derived in this study, provide a basis for quantifying interception rates as a function of previous wetness of canopies and grass species. 1616 - 1620 ataroff@ula. vemnaranjo@ula. v...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{changes in}} {{soil organic matter}} (SOM) from {{undisturbed}} Mediterranean forests and neighbouring deforested sites were assessed by analysing soil lipids and humic acids (HAs), in total studying 80 variables. Changes {{in the composition of}} free lipids reflected vegetation types, whereas HAs analysed by visible and 13 C NMR spectroscopy, sodium perborate degradation and Curie-point pyrolysis indicated the extent of structural alteration of lignin in soil. The molecular fractions released by degradation techniques applied to HAs showed that demethoxylation and oxidation were associated with the removal of forest vegetation, and the aromatic compounds consisted mainly of methoxyphenols and benzenecarboxylic acids. Decreased concentration of alkanes and increased amounts of alcohols were observed after removal of forests. The chain lengths of alkyl compounds also tended to decrease. In forest soil, there was a series of diterpene resin acids, whereas in pasture soil steroids from animal origin and a root-derived triterpenoids with friedelan structure were found. In relation to the total quantity and quality of soil C, the overall chemical descriptors indicated that clearing and cultivation (semiarid cereal fields) lead to intense mineralization of SOM (mainly particulate, free organic matter) but the residual humic substances have enhanced maturity in terms of structural condensation and potential resilience. Conversely, the cleared forest soil under pasture had a comparatively higher potential for C sequestration, but the HA characteristics suggested selective preservation of plant biomacromolecules directly incorporated as <b>underground</b> <b>biomass...</b>|$|E
