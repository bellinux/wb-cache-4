40|$|In recent years, much {{research}} {{has been devoted to}} the development of extreme programming; contrarily, few have evaluated the understand-ing of I/O automata. In fact, few leading an-alysts would disagree with the investigation of Scheme. <b>UNLAY,</b> our new heuristic for neural networks [21, 16, 22], is the solution to all of these grand challenges. ...|$|E
50|$|Multiple {{turns of}} twine (sometimes called small stuff for smaller lines) or heavier {{whipcord}} (for large diameter cables and ropes) are tightly {{wrapped around a}} rope's cut end to prevent its fibers from <b>unlaying.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{benefit of}} a common {{whipping}} is that no tools are necessary and the rope {{does not need to}} be <b>unlayed.</b> The problem is that it will slide off the end of the rope with little provocation. Other whippings avoid this by interleaving the whipping with the strands of the rope and creating friction with the strands to avoid slipping.|$|R
5000|$|Marlinspike ( [...] ; {{sometimes}} marlin spike, marlinespike, or the archaic marlingspike/marling-spike) {{is a tool}} used {{in marine}} ropework. Shaped {{in the form of}} a polished metal cone tapered to a rounded or flattened point, they aid in such tasks as <b>unlaying</b> rope for splicing, untying knots, drawing marline tight using a marlinspike hitch, and as a toggle joining ropes under tension in a belaying pin splice.|$|R
5000|$|The ends of {{the rope}} are first wrapped in tape or heated with a flame to prevent each end from fraying completely. The rope is <b>unlayed</b> for a {{distance}} equal to three times the diameter for each [...] "tuck", e.g., for five tucks in half inch rope, undo about 7.5 inches. Wrap the rope at that point to prevent it unwinding further. Form the loop and plait the three ends back against the twist of the rope. Practice is required to keep each end to retain its twist and lie neatly. In stiff old rope or in new rope which has been tightly wound, a marlinspike or fid can facilitate opening up the strands and threading each end.|$|R
5000|$|The single-strand stopper knot is...variety of knob knots. Generally it is tied as a {{terminal}} knot {{in the end}} of a rope, where it forms a knob or bunch, the general purpose of which is to prevent unreeving. It is found in the ends of running rigging. It secures the end of a sewing thread; it provides a handhold or a foothold in bell ropes and footropes. It adds weight {{to the end of a}} heaving line, and it is often employed decoratively, but it should not be used to prevent <b>unlaying</b> and fraying except in small cord, twine, and the like, as a whippingis in every way preferable for large and valuable material.

5000|$|Most {{extension}} cables {{made with}} 20 A stage pin connectors use 12/3 type SOOW or SJOOW cable which has three individually insulated 12 awg (American Wire Gauge) stranded conductors inside a larger jacket. The internal insulation is usually colored black (for line), white (for neutral) and green(for ground). This cable configuration can safely handle the full 20 ampere {{rating of the}} connector. The designation SOOW or SJOOW refers to the cable's insulation construction and type. SJ— (300 volts, maximum) and S— (600 volts, maximum) are both [...] "most severe" [...] service cordage. This type of cable is very hard-wearing, resistant to oil and moisture, and resists the kinking that can result in internal conductors <b>unlaying</b> and twisting, which is a common problem with the SJTW cable often used in household-grade extension cords. However, older cable made using natural rubber is susceptible to dry-rotting, particularly in the heat generated by lighting equipment. This can cause the insulation to fail and expose or short circuit the conductors leading to shock or fire hazard if old cable is not inspected regularly and replaced as needed.|$|R
