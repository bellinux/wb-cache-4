5|$|For {{much of the}} country's history, {{voluntary}} acquisition {{or exercise}} of a foreign citizenship was considered sufficient cause for revocation of national citizenship.

However, the Supreme Court repudiated this concept in Afroyim v. Rusk (1967), as well as Vance v.

However, Congress can revoke citizenship that it had previously granted to a person not born in the United States.|$|E

5|$|As a {{response}} to recent obesity trends in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> nations, Burger King modified its menu and food preparation practices. In addition to offering lower-fat menu item such as salads, the company has updated its nutrition guides to include dietary guidelines and other nutritional data. One of its reactions to the concerns over trans-fats was to initiate a program in January 2008 to phase out added trans-fat in its products, and to switch to pure vegetable oils that are free of hydrogenated fats. The program ended in early 2009 with a complete changeover to the new oils. Most, but not all, of the products contain no added trans-fats; some products, such as the beef used in the hamburgers, still contain naturally occurring trans-fats.|$|E

Its transmitter, now directly controlled by a quartz oscillator, was moved to College Park, Maryland. Broadcasts began on 5MHz. A year later, the station was moved again, to Department of Agriculture land in Beltsville, Maryland. Broadcasts were added on 10 and 15MHz, power was increased, and time signals, an A440 tone, and ionosphere reports were all added to the broadcast in June 1937.|$|E
