40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the total direct costs of raising external equity capital for US real estate investment trust (REIT) initial public offerings (IPOs). Design/methodology/approach – The study provides recent evidence on total direct costs for a comprehensive dataset of 125 US REIT IPOs from 1996 until June 2010. A multivariate OLS regression is performed to determine significant factors influencing the level of total direct costs and also <b>underwriting</b> <b>fees</b> and non-underwriting direct expenses. Findings – The study finds economies of scale in total direct costs, <b>underwriting</b> <b>fees</b> and non-underwriting expenses. The equally (value) weighted average total direct costs are 8. 33 percent (7. 52 percent), consisting of 6. 49 percent (6. 30 percent) <b>underwriting</b> <b>fees</b> and 1. 87 percent (1. 22 percent) non-underwriting direct expenses. The study finds a declining trend of total direct costs for post 2000 IPOs which is attributed to the declining trend in both <b>underwriting</b> <b>fees</b> and non-underwriting direct expenses. Offer size is a critical determinant for both total direct costs and their individual components and inversely affects these costs. The total direct costs are found significantly higher for equity REITs than for mortgage REITs and are also significantly higher for offers listed in New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). <b>Underwriting</b> <b>fees</b> appear to be negatively influenced by the offer price, the number of representative underwriters involved in the issue, industry return volatility and the number of potential specific risk factors but positively influenced by prior quarter industry dividend yield and ownership limit identified in the prospectus. After controlling for time trend, the paper finds REIT IPOs incur higher non-underwriting direct expenses in response to higher industry return volatility prior to the offer.

40|$|Rights {{issues are}} a common way to raise equity in the Scandinavian market (Norway, Sweden and Denmark). We have {{investigated}} underwritten rights issues in the Scandinavian countries for the period 2002 - 2010. Our full sample consists of 101 rights issues. The focus of this thesis {{is to examine the}} relationship between risk and reward relating to underwriting services and possible differences within Scandinavia. Based on the suggestion of Galai and Schneller (1978) we have assessed the value of the underwriting service using option pricing framework. Based on our analyses we found that the <b>underwriting</b> <b>fee</b> charged in the Scandinavian market produces excess returns to the underwriters. The mean <b>underwriting</b> <b>fee</b> charged is proven to be 3. 58 %. The underwriters earned on average an excess return of 2. 72 %. This means that on average 76 % of the <b>underwriting</b> <b>fee</b> is excess return to the underwriter. The highest degree of mispricing we observed in the Swedish market, where excess returns to the underwriter are 3. 63 %. Norway seems to have the most efficiently priced underwriting market. The average put values in the Scandinavian market are similar to that of previous research and the higher excess return, ceteris paribus, must thus be explained by higher underwriting fees. We also had a qualitative approximation to our problem where we interview three investors and three banks. In general it appears that investors and banks have many of the same thoughts in the questions asked regarding the risk and pricing of the <b>underwriting</b> <b>fee...</b>|$|E

Investment banks charge a much higher <b>underwriting</b> <b>fee</b> between three years and one year before a crisis than they do during tranquil periods. This result is statistically significant after controlling for sovereign bond spreads and other variables. Moreover, investment banks´ behavior differs {{depending on the type of}} debt crisis.

40|$|We exploit unique {{features}} of the U. S. municipal bond underwriting market to assess how political integrity affects primary financial market outcomes. We show that state corruption and political connections have strong effects on several aspects of municipal bond sales and underwriting. Specifically, we find that higher state corruption is associated with greater credit risk, higher bond yields, greater use of external credit enhancement, and use of lower quality underwriters. This corruption effect is over-and-above other state financial and economic characteristics. States that are more corrupt can eliminate the corruption yield penalty by purchasing credit enhancements, effectively selling integrity-related default risk to an independent financial intermediary. Underwriting fees do not vary with cross-state corruption, but were significantly higher during an era when underwriters routinely made political campaign contributions to win underwriting business. Furthermore, this pay-to-play <b>underwriting</b> <b>fee</b> premium exists only for negotiated bid bonds where underwriting business can be allocated {{on the basis of}} political favoritism.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to empirically examine the {{relationship}} between the level of underwriter spread and ownership structure by using data from Japanese IPO firms that are issued during the years 1997 - 2002. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses regression analysis to determine the effect of the ownership structure (board, bank, affiliated venture capital firms) on underwriter spread and on the post-issue operating performance of IPO firms. Findings – This paper finds several results that are in contrast with previous studies. The ownership by board members is positively associated with the level of gross spread but is not associated with post-issue operating performance. The presence of a commercial bank in the ownership structure of IPO firms decreases the gross spread and increases the post-issue operating performance of IPO firms. Issuers pay a lower <b>underwriting</b> <b>fee</b> as the ownership share of the lead underwriter-affiliated VC increases, unlike that of other VCs.

40|$|Purpose – This is {{the first}} REIT paper to seek to empirically examine {{potential}} influencing factors on the discounts and <b>underwriting</b> <b>fees</b> of Australian REIT rights issues. Design/methodology/approach – Using a methodology similar to Owen and Suchard, and Armitage, a sample of 62 A-REIT rights issues during 2001 - 2009 is analyzed. A variety of potential factors influencing discounts and <b>underwriting</b> <b>fees</b> are explored. Findings – Over A$ 20 billion was raised by A-REIT rights issues during 2001 - 2009 (this around three times that raised through A-REIT initial public offerings during the same period). The mean offer price was discounted around 9. 5 percent from the current market price and <b>underwriting</b> <b>fees</b> averaged 2. 9 percent of gross proceeds raised – both substantially less than for industrial rights issues. The standard deviation of daily returns {{for the past year}} appears to influence the percentage discount offered to subscribers. This volatility was particularly noticeable in 2008 and 2009, during the global financial crisis, where new issues were discounted substantially so as to raise equity to repay debt. This historical risk variable appears paramount in determining the discounts to subscribers and fees to underwriters. Practical implications – A-REITs seeking to minimize the discounts offered to subscribers and to minimize their underwriting costs with rights issue equity capital raisings must first minimize their share price volatility.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays in financial intermediation. The first essay develops a theory of deposits as a safer means of payment (bank notes or checks) in competing with money (cash). It turns out that banks can lend out the money from deposits for a charge, and this supply of inside money increases the total money supply in the economy. Comparative statics show {{that the existence of}} banks improves the social welfare. The second essay shows that strategic behavior between banks in overcoming asymmetric information in the lending market leads to changes in credit standards that result in credit crunches. We investigate the amplification mechanism and provide empirical evidence that changes in banking lending standards {{is an important part of}} business cycle dynamics. The third essay explains the IPO market dynamics in terms of volume and pricing with a model of the IPO process as a repeated certification game where investment banks produce information about IPO firms. The IPO price and the <b>underwriting</b> <b>fee</b> serve to screen firms to control the quality of the firms going public. In the case with more than one investment bank, the “reputations” of investment banks are interpreted as a form of market segmentation to economize on the social cost of information production. ...|$|E
