50|$|From the 1950s onward society {{noticed an}} {{increase}} in street gang culture, random vandalism and graffiti. Sociologists, psychologists, social workers and judges all had theories {{as to what was}} causing the increase to <b>urban</b> <b>trouble,</b> but it was later accepted that it developed in protest to the older generation's pro-white supremacy views. The consensus has generally tended to be that the modern urban environment offers all the bright lights and benefits of the modern world but often provides working class youths with little in reality. This theory and others were parodied in the musical West Side Story (based on Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet) in song lyrics such as Jet Song, America, and Gee, Officer Krupke. Moral panics surrounding the advent of teenager subcultures and a perceived rise in adolescent criminality led to several attempts to investigate and legislate youth behavior, such as the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency. One of the many subcultures that was based around street violence was the greaser, a working class subculture that was a part of and influenced the biker subculture.|$|R

50|$|Fifteen years ago, this {{community}} was situated {{in an area}} of Minneapolis plagued by urban flight and crime. Instrumental to the rehabilitation and renovation of this neighborhood is a local community development corporation, Hope Community, Inc. In the late 1980s, residents were selling their properties for one dollar because they had lost all value; this is when the Hope Community began purchasing houses in the hopes of developing affordable rental units clustered together on a single block. Today, nine rehabilitated houses abut community areas, a playground, and gardens. Property values are steadily increasing and the community itself is stabilizing. By following principles of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) and creating defensible space, the Hope Community has created a sense of shared ownership and community in a <b>troubled</b> <b>urban</b> area.|$|R
40|$|This {{symposium}} piece {{explores the}} current state of our cities with a particular emphasis on political power, education and housing, and examines whether our move away from integration and towards diversity has been a trade worth making. Despite the transformation of most of the largest cities to majority-minority status, the latest data indicate that our housing remains deeply segregated, and <b>urban</b> schools deeply <b>troubled,</b> and in many instances, whites have been able to retain political power. The increased emphasis on diversity has not translated into the expected multicultural renaissance.

40|$|Abstract: Based {{on field}} {{research}} in politically contested cities in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, this paper pro-vides a methodological guide to analyzing urban policy in jurisdictions with multiethnic conflict. It seeks {{to stimulate the}} intellectual development of comparative conflict studies by illuminating the issues involved in cross-national <b>urban</b> re-search in <b>troubled</b> settings of ethnic conflict and fragmentation. It describes why scholars must be clear in articulating the types of cities under study and how a specific analytic “lens ” {{can be used to}} gain access to wider issues of urban govern-ance and policymaking in divided societies. Key urban ethnic conditions- territoriality/control over land, distribution of economic benefits and costs, access to policy-making, and group identity- are described in terms of how they can facili-tate or impede the movement toward peaceful co-existence. The paper positions the “city ” not as a unitary actor but one that is internally differentiated and externally linked. A comparative analytic framework (“scaffolding”) for cross-national research on urban conflict is then presented. Finally, empirical vignettes from eight contested cities in Spain, the forme...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{design is}} {{primarily}} and essentially three-dimensional design (Gosling and Maitland 1984), {{concerned with the}} shape, the surface and its physical arrangement {{of all kinds of}} urban elements; the basic components that make up the built environment at the level of buildings, spaces and human activities (Xia and Qing 2004). Gosling and Maitland (1984) state that the main objective of the urban designer is ‘to formulate and present the problem as accurately and vividly as possible’. Within the current design process and traditional methods of visualisation, (Xia and Qing 2004) state that current design methods only allow for a 2 D representation of a space to be created. Architectural design practices will produce computerised renderings or 3 D computer massing models to give a more accurate representation of the space. However there have been limited attempts at three dimensional computer representations which allow the user to get a greater sense of the urban space. Therefore, how {{to improve the quality of}} urban space and to express the design schema more effectively are problems that have been <b>troubling</b> <b>urban</b> designers for a long tim...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} "Closed Housing Project" (CHP), a {{building}} type {{found in the}} Colombian capital of Bogota. Responding to Bogota's problem of insecurity, CHPs are groups of dwellings that are organised around, or within, outdoor communal grounds {{closed to the public}} and surveyed by an armed guard. The CHP, however, is much more than gates and guns. Due to its enclosure, it is isolated from Bogota's <b>troubled</b> <b>urban</b> setting. As a result, the CHP has become a marketing phenomena packaged and promoted by developers as an escape from many of the social problems of living in Bogota. The consuming public has accepted this option and popular culture now perceives the CHP as a necessary and appealing way of life. Mostly drawing from the Bogota architectural press, this study argues that the insular nature of the CHP makes a return to earlier housing types typically found in Bogota, and thus is evidence of architectural continuity in the city. The thesis also analyses the role of the CHP type in contemporary consumer culture...|$|R
40|$|The Chicago cap-and-trade {{approach}} to regulating stationary source VOC {{emissions in the}} Chicago ozone non-attainment area is a pioneering program that could set a precedent for other <b>urban</b> areas <b>troubled</b> by high ozone concentrations. It holds out the promise of cost-effectiveness, innovation stimulation, and flexibility compared with traditional regulation. To appraise this program design and evaluate these objectives, this study analyzes four years of data {{since the inception of}} the program in 2000. The data reveal that while emissions are far below the cap, there are unexpectedly large banks, startling expirations, and low prices of tradable permits, all inconsistent with an effective market. We find that the market as designed has been constrained from reaching its objectives by the continuance and extension of an underlying layer of traditional regulation, {{and to a lesser extent}} by over-allotment of tradable permits. That is, traditional regulation and over-allotment, combined with a market design calling for a small reduction in emissions from baseline and a one-year limit on banking, explain the incongruous outcomes recorded in the market. (cont.) This study explores the evolution of this particular market design and presents statistical evidence in support of the hypothesis that the performance of a cap-and-trade market is very sensitive to design features when combined with other regulatory measures. The study concludes that the market as presently designed falls far short of achieving cost effectiveness, innovation stimulation, and flexibility. The policy recommendations include that the cap be significantly tightened, perhaps in a series of steps, and the banking horizon be extended to three years or more. Such redesign should enable the cap-and-trade {{approach to}} assume its proper role in helping to achieve the new eight-hour standard for ozone concentrations...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{takes into}} account good {{practices}} of community planning realized in Turin and in particular it describes an ethnographically-oriented participant-observation study conducted while I worked as consultant within the “Residual Areas Project”, a program managed by the Urban Design Office of the Municipality, meant to intervene in neglected public space located in <b>trouble</b> <b>urban</b> district, intended as an area of co-design between art, architecture, urban planning and social sciences and aimed to (re) design those spaces implementing a bottom-up logic and setting-up a “sense of belonging” through actions based on active collaboration between citizens, users, mediators and planners. Data collected included audio-recorded interviews with participants, participant observations, and photographic recordings.

40|$|Vacant and {{abandoned}} houses {{have been a}} problem for urban areas for years and that problem has been exacerbated in the later part of {{the first decade of the}} 2000 s due to shrinking <b>urban</b> populations and <b>troubles</b> in the housing market. Previous research has shown that demolishing vacant {{and abandoned}} houses improves public safety and health in neighborhoods. It also protects the value of other properties nearby and can help to keep a neighborhood from heading into decline. Finally, it can mollify voters living near a vacant and abandoned house that has fallen into disrepair. This exploratory project challenges the wisdom of complaint-driven demolition programs by examining the effects of demolitions on the condition and assessed value of adjoining properties in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Inspections were made of properties on which demolitions had occurred, on properties where water had been shut-off for at least 17 months, and the adjoining properties. Assessed values and other data from property record cards and the Allen County geographic information system were added to the data set. The nature of the effects on adjoining properties was consistent when comparing the demolition properties to the water shut-off properties, but the findings were inconclusive. In some ways the properties adjoining a demolition property fare better than the properties adjoining a shut-off property. In other ways the opposite is true, and in some cases there is no difference...|$|R
40|$|For most of {{the twentieth}} century tin was {{fundamental}} for both warfare and welfare. The importance of tin is most powerfully represented by the tin can - an invention which created a revolution in food preservation and helped feed both the armies of the great powers and the masses of the new <b>urban</b> society. The <b>trouble</b> with tin was that economically viable deposits of the metal could only be found in a few regions of the world, predominantly in the southern hemisphere, while the main centers of consumption were in the industrialized north. The tin trade was therefore a highly politically charged economy in which states and private enterprise competed and cooperated to assert control over deposits, smelters and markets. Tin provides a particularly telling illustration of how the interactions of business and governments shape the evolution of the global economic trade; the tin industry has experienced extensive state intervention during times of war, encompasses intense competition and cartelization, and has seen industry centers both thrive and fail in the wake of decolonization. The history of the international tin industry reveals the complex interactions and interdependencies between local actors and international networks, decolonization and globalization, as well as government foreign policies and entrepreneurial tactics. By highlighting the global struggles for control and the constantly shifting economic, geographical and political constellations within one specific industry, this collection of essays brings the state back into business history, and the firm into the history of international relations...|$|R
40|$|My {{investigation}} {{addresses the}} following research question: How does Marvin L. Winans Academy of Performing Arts (WAPA) foster the development of relational trust? A large body of research demonstrates that school reform efforts tend to be successful when trust and trusting relationships exist within the school community, that trusting relationships among various stakeholders (primarily students and staff) help students to be both academically and socially fit, and that those relationships help foster social capital, which supports success {{in and out of}} school. As a researcher practitioner I set out to sample students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of WAPA practices that could have led to its becoming a rare success story among Detroit high schools with predominately African American populations. Qualitative data were obtained from a series of one-on-one interviews with students. Among other topics, students were asked about their school experience before and after attending Winans Academy, and about their relationships with school faculty and staff. Positive perceptions and outlook appeared to correlate with students 2 ̆ 7 belief that other members of the school community cared about them, respected them and trusted them. Students were also able to name specific practices at Winans Academy 2 ̆ 7 that supported their view of a caring community, such as access to staff, opportunities for casual conversation with staff, and policies and practices that foster strong personal identity and a sense of belonging, such as a school creed and uniform. One may conclude from the findings that Winans Academy has succeeded in building relational trust through thoughtful practices implemented by a caring principal and staff. These practices may serve {{as a starting point for}} turning around other <b>troubled</b> <b>urban</b> schools. ...|$|R
40|$|In this chapter, I {{argue that}} utopian and visionary {{thinking}} {{in planning and}} design are crucial to facing current and future urban and global challenges. I also advocate that urban planners and designers must become utopians and visionary thinkers to explore new and innova- tive approaches to managing current and future urban and global challenges. The underpinning principles, theoretical elements, and practical works of utopias present cogent understandings to appreciating the evolution and value of ecological design and planning in everyday life. Utopia may seem an uncharacteristic avenue to explore {{as a source of}} inspiration for eco- logical planning and design. It could seem even odd to advocate utopian and visionary thinking as a way to face current and future urban and global challenges—among them climate change, food security, environmental pollution, loss of biodiversity, and the incremental increase in the world’s population—and their consequences. We only have to look to history for a guidepost to the future. The challenges of urban pollution, depletion of natural resources, water and air quality, and the abominable life conditions of the urban population after the advent and the consolidation of the Industrial Age all inspired new proposals of urban visioning and planning. This vision was also at the core of known utopias directly conceived of or applied, in various ways, to com- munities in North America. The authors of these myriad utopias had a singular vision, however, that was devoid of the environmental decay of <b>urban</b> areas and <b>troubled</b> social relations. As David Pinder wrote, they “... attached importance to intervening in cities and urban spaces for political and social ends, in recognition {{of the ways in which}} society is spatially constituted. ...|$|R
40|$|This papers {{addresses}} {{the connections between}} cities’ revitalization, public space and issues such as social inclusion, urban governance and citizens’ participation in the decision making process within the Italian context. More generally it aims {{to answer the following}} questions: how do people transform spaces into places? What’s their role in designing urban public spaces? How do they creatively intervene in the design of urban spaces? Public space, as clearly expressed by Lefebvre, is the primary site of public culture. But it is also, as Zukin points out, a privileged window to city’s soul and creativity. In such a context the paper takes into account good practices of community planning realized in Turin and in particular it presents the outcomes of an ethnographically-oriented participant-observation study conducted while I worked as consultant within the Residual Areas Project, a program managed by the Urban Design Office of the Municipality, meant to intervene in neglected public space located in <b>trouble</b> <b>urban</b> district.

40|$|This project {{examines}} neglected African American urban narratives {{produced by}} male writers from the mid- 1960 s to mid 1970 s, {{in order to}} document and interrogate how the production of subjectivities and masculinities are shown to intersect, in these works, with vectors of mobility and modalities of spatial occupation. The study begins with the mobile culture of the Blues, and highlights sophisticated Blues stylings to trace the operation of a language of vagrancy [...] -a discourse of malleability that opens the masculine subject to multiplicity and detachment. It then examines the spectacular, transient, and materialistic player of the urban "barbershop books," and details, in Robert Beck's Pimp: The Story of My Life, and in Donald Goines's Whoreson and Daddy Cool, the exhausting, destructive experiments that permit display and re-invention on the "street. " This vision is supplemented with urban texts that address the subject's inhabitation of densely peopled space and the enigma of fleshly occupation in <b>urban</b> arrangements of <b>troubling</b> proximity. The work examines Chester Himes's Blind Man With a Pistol, Eldridge Cleaver's Soul on Ice, and Down these Mean Streets, by Piri Thomas, in order to consider the excessive traces of bodily inhabitation and the provocative yet repulsive closeness of an enigmatic neighbour. It then turns to George Cain's poetic Blueschild Baby and Robert Beck's Mama Black Widow, to interrogate how these texts address the death drive and delineate the possibility of inhabiting the ruined ghetto with an insistent impulse to endure and resist. Finally, the work considers two texts, Robert Deane Pharr's S. R. O. and Herbert Simmons's Man Walking on Eggshells, in which segmented space, proliferating multiplicities, and emergent subjects invite a reading informed by the vocabularies of Gilles Deleuze. The project ends by reading the urban subject as a stylish, agile principle of released motion, creative doubt and active engagement with differences and potentialities...|$|R
40|$|Designated as an {{exemplary}} master's project for 2015 - 16 * Baltimore, Maryland, and Detroit, Michigan, were once sparkling examples of postwar American progress. In the early 20 th century, their thriving manufacturing industries and lively cultural scenes brought wealth and acclaim, attracting a steady influx {{of immigrants and}} southern Americans searching for a share of their offerings. Like other metropolises across the American Rust Belt, however, the cities have since suffered the effects of postwar deindustrialization. Unemployment and poverty <b>trouble</b> <b>urban</b> centers that once burgeoned during those pre-WWII swells. While the roots of their urban crises are complex, decline in both Detroit and Baltimore demonstrates the powerful impact of racist practices and policies that American cities developed and implemented long before the flight of industry. In this research I explore the role that racism—in both its informal, personal manifestation and its formal, systemic manifestation—had in the decline of both cities. Prewar records including court cases, government ordinances and informal documents demonstrate that Detroit and Baltimore pioneered groundbreaking discriminatory policies and procedures in response to their growing African-American populations in the early 20 th century. African Americans were systematically excluded from all but the lowest-level employment positions, resulting in low wages, high unemployment, low work satisfaction and low safety. This discrimination created a grave disparity in wealth between white and black communities within the cities. Concurrent housing discrimination, which controlled the physical residency of black families and their access to wealth investment options via homeownership, further separated the status of racial groups in Detroit and Baltimore. When deindustrialization after the Second World War depleted urban centers of jobs and revenue, white residents of means were able to relocate. This flight of capital from Detroit and Baltimore cities served to concentrate African-American populations—with few resources at their disposal—into census tracts that became plagued with poverty, crime {{and a lack of}} opportunity. Detroit and Baltimore city residents—mostly African-American—have experienced continued employment, housing and environmental discrimination since, further damaging their capability to restore the cities themselves. By instituting racist practices in the decades prior to deindustrialization, both cities—in effect—crippled themselves to deal with its consequences...|$|R

The {{results of this study}} illustrate the complex interactions between HIV sexual risk behavior and injection drug use as well as knowing people with AIDS. ^ Two separate studies were conducted to address the study objectives. In the first paper we examined the hypothesis that injection drug users will present distinct demographic characteristics and exhibit high risk sexual behavior than other drug users. In the second paper, we examined the association between knowing people with AIDS and demographic characteristics as well as sexual risk behavior of adults. ^ Data for this study came from a larger community-based anonymous survey designed to determine knowledge, misconception, and sources of information in minority population regarding HIV transmission in January 1997 and June 1998. ^ The findings from the injection drug use study suggest a relatively high prevalence of injection drug use and health compromising sexual practices among injection drug users in an understudied population. Race/ethnicity was the only demographic characteristic which demonstrated association in multivariate logistic regression analysis. A number of sexual risk behavior characteristics including age at first sexual intercourse, sexual identity and number of sexual partners in last three months were associated with injection drug use in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. The demonstrated association between injection drug use and high risk sexual behavior not only suggest the importance of public health programs designed to address race/ethnicity related factors but also demonstrate the need for much greater attention to injection drug users 2 ̆ 7 sexual risk behavior beyond the scope of their needle sharing behavior. Further research is required to determine the directionality of the association and the effects of commonly used injection drugs on sexual risk behavior, but our findings, together with other reports on the prevalence of injection drug use and the already high-prevalence of HIV among injection drug users in <b>urban</b> communities, hold <b>troubling</b> implications {{for the future of the}} HIV epidemic in this population. ^ In the role of knowing people with AIDS on sexual behavior study, 867 (58. 5...|$|R
