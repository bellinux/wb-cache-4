5|$|This {{bridge is}} {{named in honor}} and remembrance of Charles West Cullen (18651948), a man who {{dedicated}} his life to public service and {{to the citizens of}} Delaware. Between 1930 and 1940, he served on the State Highway Commission, eventually being elevated to Chairman of the Commission from 1938-1939. While he was Chairman, work was started on a new bridge to span the Indian River Inlet. In recognition for his service on the Commission, the bridge was dedicated on May 28, 1940, in his name for his advocacy for the proper opening of the inlet and the internal development of the Indian River. Two additional bridges bearing his name have spanned the inlet since that time. This, the fifth bridge to span the inlet waterway, is also being dedicated in his name. As this bridge serves the public, let <b>us</b> <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> the lifetime of service that he gave.|$|E

2500|$|Amnesty International [...] Irene Khan {{criticized the}} use of pro-humanitarian {{arguments}} by Coalition countries prior to its 2003 invasion of Iraq, writing in an open letter: [...] "This selective attention to human rights {{is nothing but a}} cold and calculated manipulation of the work of human rights activists. Let <b>us</b> <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> that these same governments {{turned a blind eye to}} Amnesty International's reports of widespread human rights violations in Iraq before the Gulf War."". Amnesty International, 25 September 2004.|$|E
2500|$|Joe Kennedy, vice {{president}} of marketing for GM marque Saturn, accepted concerns regarding the EV1's cost, the outdated lead-acid battery technology, and the car's limited range, saying [...] "Let <b>us</b> <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> that technology starts small and grows slowly before technology improves and costs go down." [...] Some anti-taxation groups were against the exemptions and tax credits that EV1 lessees received, which they said constituted government-subsidized motoring for affluent professionals. Some of these groups, such as consumer organization Californians Against Utility Company Abuse (which mounted opposition to the use of taxpayer dollars to build public EV charging stations), were themselves accused of receiving their funding from oil companies interested in keeping gasoline cars on the roads. Concerns were also raised that the car had received only a limited launch, because GM had made a deal with CARB to delay the implementation of the first phase of the ZEV program, which had been scheduled to go into effect in 1998.|$|E

5000|$|It first {{appeared}} {{in the second half of}} the 17th century in what is today known as the Koverninsky District of the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast. The handicraft was named Khokhloma after a trade settlement in the same oblast, where craftsmen had been known for making and selling their handmade goods between the 18th and early 20th centuries. The making of khokhloma was first mentioned in 1659 in the letter of a boyar called Morozov to his bailiff, containing an order for the following: [...] "One hundred painted dishes polished with powdered tin, both large and medium, of the very same kind possessed by <b>us</b> earlier, <b>not</b> <b>forgetting</b> twenty large painted wine bowls, twenty medium, and twenty somewhat smaller".|$|R

40|$|Mental {{images are}} often used in the {{processes}} of indirect thinking, such as in fantasies (Pope and Singer 1978; Singer and Antrobus 1972). It {{has been suggested that}} this mental activity performs a function of anticipation and planning, to help <b>us</b> <b>not</b> to <b>forget</b> the activities <b>not</b> yet completed and to maintain concentration when we are engaged in tedious tasks (Singer 1975). Moreover, the mental visualization plays specific roles in the processes of thought such as direct memory, problem solving, decision-making task, and motor control (Denis 1991). All these specific features of visual thinking make it a particularly suitable candidate to support learning (both cognitive and motor), and have thus led to the construction of specific imagery training...|$|R
2500|$|Subsequently, Deputy Information Minister Matonga {{gave the}} government's {{account of the}} incident: {{he said that the}} diplomats had {{addressed}} a gathering at the home of an MDC member and that police arrived at the scene due to commotion. According to Matonga, the diplomats then fled the home but were stopped by the police at a roadblock; after they [...] "refused to disembark", police [...] "deflated the tyres of one of the vehicles". Matonga also expressed the government's outrage at the way the British and Americans were behaving, accusing them of provocations intended to elicit a government response that would [...] "play into their hands". US State Department spokesperson Sean McCormack said that the <b>US</b> would <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> the incident and that it intended to complain at the UN Security Council.|$|R

When {{you get out of the}} lane you had best stay there until the others have passed on, then you can follow them. We will wait for a few minutes after they have gone, and lock the door behind <b>us.</b> You have <b>not</b> <b>forgotten</b> where you are to find us." ...|$|R

60|$|If only I were {{articulate}} {{to paint}} in the frail medium of words what I see and know and possess incorporated in my consciousness of the mighty driftage of the races in the times before our present written history began! Yes, we had our history even then. Our old men, our priests, our wise ones, told our history into tales and wrote those tales in the stars so that our seed after <b>us</b> should <b>not</b> <b>forget.</b> From the sky came the life- giving rain and the sunlight. And we studied the sky, learned from the stars to calculate time and apportion the seasons; and we named the stars after our heroes and our foods and our devices for getting food; and after our wanderings, and drifts, and adventures; and after our functions and our furies of impulse and desire.|$|R
60|$|There {{had been}} some {{ceremony}} at the monastery amongst the hills where {{most of his time}} here is spent, and he had evidently come straight from there. His flowing black robes were splashed with mud and torn by brambles, and his white face was livid with exhaustion and anger. His dark eyes burned like fire in their hollow depths, and his right hand was raised above his head, as though he had been on the point of striking or denouncing <b>us.</b> I shall <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> his appearance while I live. It will haunt me to my dying day.|$|R

But let <b>us</b> <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> {{it is also a}} gate by which we breathe, the gate through which we speak and go impalpably forth to our object, the gate at which we can kiss the pinched, delicate, spiritual kiss. Therefore, {{although}} the main sensual gate of entrance to the lower body, it has its reference also to the upper body.|$|E
60|$|Farther on in The Ring {{we shall}} see the Hero arrive and make an end of dwarfs, giants, and gods. Meanwhile, let <b>us</b> <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> that godhood means to Wagner {{infirmity}} and compromise, and manhood strength and integrity. Above all, we must understand--for it {{is the key to}} much that we are to see--that the god, since his desire is toward a higher and fuller life, must long in his inmost soul for the advent of that greater power whose first work, though this he does not see as yet, must be his own undoing.|$|E
60|$|My friends, {{these things}} are true; and have been true for centuries. Let <b>us</b> <b>not</b> try to <b>forget</b> them by denouncing them as the utterances of the malevolent and the unbelieving. Let us rather imitate the wise man who said, that he was always {{grateful}} to his critics, for, however unjust their attacks, they were certain to attack, and therefore to show him, his weakest points. And here is our weakest point; namely, in our unhappy divisions--which are the fruits of self-will and self-conceit, and of the vain attempt to do that which God incarnate has told us we cannot do--to part the wheat from the tares.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] he went on, [...] "we {{will make}} up our minds to agree. Twenty-seven or twenty-eight, let us say. A very {{excellent}} age! A girl should know her own mind by then. And meanwhile, dear Esther, would it be wise, I wonder, {{to see a little}} less of our friend Mr. Hamel? He leaves us to-day, I think. He is very obstinate about that. If he were staying still in the house, well, it might be different. But if he persists in leaving <b>us,</b> you will <b>not</b> <b>forget,</b> dear, that association with a guest is one thing; association with a young man living out of the house is another. A great deal less of Mr. Hamel I think that we must see." ...|$|R
6000|$|There was one sight visible {{every night}} to all men which might well nerve the rescuers in their enterprise. Over the {{northern}} horizon, behind those hills of danger, there quivered {{up in the}} darkness one long, flashing, quivering beam, which swung up and down, and up again like a seraphic sword-blade. It was Kimberley praying for help, Kimberley solicitous for news. Anxiously, distractedly, the great De Beers searchlight dipped and rose. And back across the twenty miles of darkness, over the hills where Cronje lurked, there came that other southern column of light which answered, and promised, and soothed. 'Be of good heart, Kimberley. We are here! The Empire is behind <b>us.</b> We have <b>not</b> <b>forgotten</b> you. It may be days, {{or it may be}} weeks, but rest assured that we are coming.' ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the torch}} race which the Greek boys {{ran from the}} Cerameician field of death {{to the home of}} the goddess of Wisdom, not merely he who first reached the goal but he also who first started with the torch aflame {{received}} a prize.

6000|$|... “Oh! I am {{not much}} troubled, sir, with that laudable thirst after {{knowledge}} that is called curiosity. I shall believe him to he the child of Corn-stalk, or Corn-planter, or some other renowned chieftain; possibly of the Big Snake himself; and shall treat him as such until he sees fit to shave his good-looking head, borrow some half-dozen pair of my best earrings, shoulder his rifle again, and disappear as suddenly {{as he made his}} entrance. So come, my dear sir, and let <b>us</b> <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> the rites of hospitality, for the short time he is to remain with us.” ...|$|E
60|$|And after all, gentlemen, {{when we are}} {{upon the}} sorrows {{of the rich and}} the heavy blows that have been struck by this wicked Budget, let <b>us</b> <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> that this Budget, which is denounced by all the vested {{interests}} in the country and in all the abodes of wealth and power, after all, draws nearly as much from the taxation of tobacco and spirits, which are the luxuries of the working classes, who pay their share with silence and dignity, as it does from those wealthy classes upon whose behalf such heartrending outcry is made.|$|E
60|$|I {{have but}} {{to raise my}} hand, any time--do you understand?--any time, and you are lost. You control your state. Very well. But never forget that to-morrow, if I wished, I could buy your whole machine out from under you. I know you cannot change yourself, but, {{for the sake of}} the big issues at stake, you must be careful, {{exceedingly}} careful. We are compelled to work with weak tools. You are a good liver, a flesh-pot man. You drink too much. Your heart is weak.--Oh, I have the report of your doctor. Nevertheless, don't make a fool of yourself, nor of <b>us.</b> Besides, do <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> that your wife is my daughter. She is a strong woman, a credit to both of us.

60|$|From {{that day}} I was {{frequently}} {{allowed to enter}} the Mother's Room, but, as I had feared, these visits failed to bring me into any closer relationship with {{the lady of the}} house. She had indeed forgotten my offense: I was one of her children, sharing equally with the others in her impartial affection, and privileged to sit at her feet to relate to her the incidents of the day, or describe all I had seen, and sometimes to touch her thin white hand with my lips. But the distance separating <b>us</b> was <b>not</b> <b>forgotten.</b> At the two first interviews she had taught me, once for all, that it was for me to love, honor, and serve her, and that anything beyond that--any attempt to win her confidence, to enter into her thoughts, or make her understand my feelings and aspirations--was regarded as pure presumption on my part. The result was that I was less happy than I had been before knowing her: my naturally buoyant and hopeful temper became tinged with melancholy, and that vision of exquisite bliss in the future, which had floated before me, luring me on, now began to look pale, and to seem further and further away.|$|R
5000|$|We must {{remember}} that just because he {{has gone back to}} the non-physical realm he is still very much with <b>us,</b> we should <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> that his time here was set and agreed upon and he has completed his mission, that being said all fringe dwellers must now rise above the despair and confusion they feel and turn it into positive energy and by doing this they will honour his work in the best possible way. Stuart will be remembered for making a huge contribution towards the new golden age of peace and love that is fast approaching, his followers will indeed take up his torch and light up planet earth like never before. We must ponder this question...What if by him leaving his body at this time he can contribute even more to world peace ?, anyone that knows him will know that he will be doing just that." ...|$|R
