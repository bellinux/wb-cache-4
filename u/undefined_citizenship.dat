5000|$|An Estonian Alien's Passport (Estonian: v√§lismaalase pass) is {{a travel}} {{document}} {{that may be}} issued {{to a person who}} is stateless or of <b>undefined</b> <b>citizenship</b> residing in Estonia by the Police and Border Guard Board of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. It can also be used as an identity document.|$|E
50|$|Persons of <b>undefined</b> <b>citizenship</b> who reside legally in Estonia {{can apply}} for an alien's {{passport}}. Estonian alien's passport allows visa-free travel within Schengen treaty countries for a maximum of 90 days in a 6-month period.

50|$|Currently about a {{third of}} Estonia's Russophones are Estonian citizens, another third have Russian citizenship. At the same time in 2006 around 9% of Estonia's {{residents}} were of <b>undefined</b> <b>citizenship.</b> While there have been calls for the return of all Estonia's Russians to Russia, the Government of Estonia has been adopting an integration policy, advocating an idea that Estonia's residents should possess at least a basic knowledge of the Estonian language.|$|E
5000|$|Estonia: Defined as {{a nation}} state in its 1920 constitution, up until the period of Soviet colonialisation, Estonia was {{historically}} a very homogenous state with 88.2% of residents being Estonians, 8.2% Russians, 1.5% Germans and 0.4% Jews according to the 1934 census. As a result of Soviet policies the demographic situation significantly changed {{with the arrival of}} Russian speaking settlers. Today Estonians form 69%, Russians 25.4%, Ukrainians 2.04% and Belarusians 1.1% of the population (2012). A significant proportion of the inhabitants (84.1%) are citizens of Estonia, around 7.3% are citizens of Russia and 7.0% as yet <b>undefined</b> <b>citizenship</b> (2010).|$|E
50|$|The Citizenship and Migration Board is a {{government}} agency {{which is responsible for}} organization of the Estonian citizenship matters and personal identification; issues of identity documents and visas; citizens and free movement of the labor force within the country and between other organizations. The agency is further responsible for organizing and cooperating within the international protection protocols. The board is also an institution which patrols the migration situation and in a case of severe violation of the countries laws can also cancel persons residency and deport non-citizens with an <b>undefined</b> <b>citizenship</b> out of Estonia if such matter is required. Currently there are 18 operational Citizenship and Migration Board offices and client service facilities in Estonia.|$|E
5000|$|The {{perceived}} {{difficulty of}} the language tests became a point of international contention, as {{the government of the}} Russian Federation and a number of human rights organizations objected {{on the grounds that they}} made it hard for many Russians who had not learned the language to gain the citizenship in the short term. As a result, the tests were altered somewhat, due to which the number of stateless persons steadily decreased. According to Estonian officials, in 1992, 32% of residents lacked any form of citizenship. In May 2009, the Population register reported that 7.6% of residents have <b>undefined</b> <b>citizenship</b> and 8.4% have foreign citizenship, mostly Russian. As the Russian Federation was recognized as the successor state to the Soviet Union, all former USSR citizens qualified for natural-born citizenship of Russia, available upon mere request, as provided by the law [...] "On the RSFSR Citizenship" [...] in force up to the end of 2000.|$|E
50|$|People who {{had arrived}} in Latvia and Estonia during the Soviet era, {{including}} their descendants born in these countries, mostly Russians, became stateless after {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union and were provided only with an option to acquire naturalised citizenship. The language issue is still contentious, particularly in Latvia, where ethnic Russians have protested against plans to liquidate education in minority languages, including Russian. Since 1992, Estonia has naturalized some 137,000 residents of <b>undefined</b> <b>citizenship,</b> mainly ethnic Russians. 136,000, or 10 percent of the total population, remain without citizenship. Both the European Union and the Council of Europe, as well as the Russian government, expressed their concern during the 1990s about minority rights in several countries, most notably Latvia and Estonia. In Moldova, the Transnistria region (where 30.4% of population is Russian) broke away from government control amid fears the country would soon reunite with Romania. In June 2006, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the plan to introduce a national policy aiming at encouraging ethnic Russians to immigrate to Russia.|$|E
