The executive branch of the Uruguayan government is responsible for designing and implementing the water resources management national policy, granting water <b>user</b> <b>rights,</b> establishing priorities for water use by regions or watersheds giving priority to drinking water, establishing water user fees, and developing the Water Code through regulation. According to the Water Code, the State shall promote the study, preservation and integrated sustainable use of water.|$|E
25|$|The newly {{approved}} Water Law (Ley de Recursos Hídricos – LRH, published March 31, 2009) has {{enhanced the}} National Water Resources System (substituting Decree No. 1081) which now consist of ANA, a National Water Resources Court, River Basin Councils, {{regional and local}} governments and water users organizations. However, some institutions foreseen under the law, such as the River Basin Councils, remain to be created. The water law also establishes priority uses of water, re-defines water <b>user</b> <b>rights,</b> understands water as an economic good, defines sanctions, considers river basins as management units and incorporates groundwater management considerations. It is foreseen that subsidiary legislation (reglamentos) will complement the water law by specifying, for instance, the roles of each institution within the National Water Resources System.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} the concept of "user's rights" has gained {{considerable}} currency in discussions {{of the limits of}} intellectual property in general, and of copyright in particular. Those arguing in favour of the public domain and increased limitations on copyright have increasingly sought to fight fire with fire-to place substantive <b>user's</b> <b>rights</b> against the claims of intellectual property. <b>User's</b> <b>rights</b> have in some jurisdictions received explicit Supreme Court imprimatur and they are expressly recognised in charters of human rights. Yet there is a residual uncertainty about the appropriateness of this language. Is it correct, as a general conceptual and normative matter, to speak of the broad liberties citizens have regarding access to ideas and information as rights? The few treatments dealing directly with this question have argued-often from a Hohfeldian footing-that ascriptions of <b>user's</b> <b>rights</b> are inappropriate. Even commentators largely sympathetic to the public domain have found themselves drawn to this conclusion. In this article, I vindicate the general applicability of rights language by arguing that these deflationary accounts are mistaken-and are mistaken even in terms of the theories of rights they themselves deploy.
