His {{character}} was initially described as [...] "a handsome and masculine but sensitive therapist who loves his family but has hurt his wife." [...] McDermott stated {{that he wanted to}} do the role to break away from his previous role as Bobby Donnell in the ABC series The Practice. [...] "This was exactly why I wanted to do this show – to change it <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> a different kind of character. People think of me as the guy from The Practice...

We can't just keep distracting ourselves we do have to educate ourselves and wake <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> something about it.

When asked point blank whether his character is Söze, Postlethwaite said, [...] "Who knows? Nobody knows. That's what's good about The Usual Suspects." [...] Spacey has also been evasive about his character's true identity. In {{an interview}} with Total Film, he said, [...] "That's for the audience to decide. My job is to show <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> a part – I don't own the audience's imagination." [...] Singer said the film is ambiguous about most of the character's details, but the fax sent {{at the end of}} the film proves in his mind that Kint is Söze.|$|E

500|$|Murray {{was cast}} in August 2014. He noted that, unlike his {{character}} on One Tree Hill, Thompson does not serve as the [...] "moral compass" [...] of the series, which meant {{that he would not}} be [...] "confined to a box" [...] and would instead be allowed to [...] "really play things <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> what's unexpected." [...] The costumes for the SSR agents in the series are meant to be distinctive to help explain their characters: Thompson wears single breasted suits with suspenders. The second season ends on a cliffhanger, with Thompson being shot by an unknown character. The executive producers insisted that Thompson was not necessarily dead, and that his fate would be revealed in a potential third season.|$|E

Beefcake had sustained a real-life injury {{to his face}} in 1990. While Beefcake was wrestling his first match in {{two and a half}} years, DiBiase and Schyster attacked him. DiBiase held Beefcake for Schyster to hit him in the face with a briefcase, but Jimmy Hart repeatedly got in the way before Schyster shoved him out of the ring.

500|$|In {{order to}} promote [...] "Everybody," [...] Madonna {{performed}} the track with backup dancers at Haoui Montaug's [...] "No Entiendes" [...] – a roving cabaret revue. In The Virgin Tour of 1985, Madonna wore a blue see-through crop-top which revealed her black bra, a purple skirt, lacy leggings and a brightly patterned jacket. She also wore crucifixes in her hair, and on her ears and neck. As the performance of [...] "Into the Groove" [...] ended, Madonna took the microphone and danced around the stage while singing [...] "Everybody".

Bono offered for the group to perform a benefit concert or small show in Sarajevo, but the city requested they hold the full PopMart show. Bono said, [...] "We offered to do a charity gig here, just turn <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> a scratch gig, but they wanted the whole fucking thing. They wanted the lemon!" [...] McGuinness added, [...] "we {{felt it was important}} that we treat this as another city on the tour, to pay them that respect. To come here and not do the whole show would have been rude." [...] According to news releases following the concert, the total net income for the show was US$13,500; however, tour promoter John Giddings noted that price did not include the costs of the production or transportation.|$|E

500|$|The feud between The Mega-Maniacs (Brutus Beefcake and Hulk Hogan) and WWF Tag Team Champions Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster) {{stemmed from}} a {{legitimate}} parasailing accident in 1990 that forced Beefcake to undergo reconstructive surgery to his face. He was unable to wrestle again until the February 15, 1993, episode of Raw. He faced DiBiase in his return match, after which DiBiase and Schyster attacked him. DiBiase held Beefcake for Schyster to {{hit him in the}} face with a briefcase, but Jimmy Hart, who managed Money Inc., repeatedly got in the way before Schyster shoved him out of the ring. Schyster then hit Beefcake in the face with the briefcase. Hart later claimed that he felt the need to [...] "step <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> the right thing" [...] and that he [...] "had a change of heart", and his intervention led to him becoming a babyface, or crowd favorite. Shortly thereafter, Hulk Hogan made his return to the WWF and joined with Beefcake, and manager Jimmy Hart, to form The Mega-Maniacs and challenge Money Inc. for the WWF Tag Team Championship.|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{the song}} was {{released}} as a limited edition one-sided white label promotional 12", on 9 March 1987, by The JAMs' own label The Sound Of Mu(sic). This version included a 15-second sample of The Beatles' [...] "All You Need Is Love", as well as samples of the MC5's [...] "Kick Out the Jams" [...] and Samantha Fox's [...] "Touch Me (I Want Your Body)". [...] The song had been declined by distributors fearful of prosecution, but copies of the white label were sent to DJs and the music press. [...] The identities of Drummond and Cauty were not made known to these recipients (Drummond was actually something of a music business veteran, and Cauty {{a former member of}} the much-hyped but unsuccessful band Brilliant). Underground Magazine speculated on this in March 1987: [...] "The whole affair is mysterious, a telephone number only and a threat that the group will soon be releasing more material... 'No, we've not been in bands before, and yes, I suppose we were originally influenced by the Beastie Boys to actually get <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> something...' Too true, but these colonials seem a touch wiser, world weary a bit, but not angry...". In the 28 March 1987 edition, NME revealed King Boy D's [...] identity as Bill Drummond.|$|E

500|$|The second {{track is}} [...] "Holiday", which Benitez {{said that he}} always wanted to remix, commenting [...] "There are new sounds on the 1987 remix , but it had a groove that needed no improvement." [...] The sound of the guitar is brought to the front in the remix, with a piano break and a middle section {{consisting}} of drum beats. The mix for [...] "Everybody" [...] starts with four repetitions of the vocal hook and then moves into a rhythm centered arrangement. Like [...] "Holiday", the middle section of [...] "Everybody" [...] features a drum break, with a synth tune backing it up. The word [...] "dance" [...] is echoed and slowed-down continuously through the break, gradually changing into the intermedia verse. At the very end, the drums are pulled out, leaving Madonna repeating the [...] "get <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> your thing" [...] phrase, which hovers over to the intro of the next song [...] "Physical Attraction". It begins with the arrangement of the original song, until the middle eight, where the composition is varied. A disconcerting sound is present {{at the end of the}} track, which, after sometime increases in volume until then next track [...] "Over and Over" [...] begins. In the [...] "Into the Groove" [...] remix, overdubs are present with the continuous repetition of the phrase [...] "c'mon". The first verse does not start until about ninety seconds into the remix. After the first [...] "Now I know you're mine" [...] line is sung, there is a percussion break, and repetition of the phrases [...] "step to the beat" [...] and [...] "c'mon". The last verse incorporates echoing on the vocals, causing overlap of the phrases. The remix ends with instrumentation from congas, whistles and timbales, giving it a Mexican ending.|$|E

Since then, Pharrell Williams revealed, in an interview in Australia,, that he had also worked with Ciara for the record along with his production outfit, The Neptunes. When asked what the recording process of her new album was like, Ciara made the following comments to Maxim magazine [...] "It's the coolest, can't lie.
