Through a poorly understood mechanism (as of 2002), it signals for RNA polymerase II to slip {{off of the}} transcript. Cleavage also involves the protein CFII, though it is unknown how. The cleavage site associated with a polyadenylation signal can vary <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> 50 nucleotides.|$|E
5|$|The terrain {{south of}} Ioannina {{provided}} excellent defensive ground. Moreover, the Ottoman forces further reinforced their positions with permanent fortifications, constructed {{under the direction}} of the German General Rüdiger von der Goltz. These were equipped with concrete artillery emplacements, bunkers, trenches, barbed wire, searchlights and machine gun positions. The Ioannina fortress area included two major fortresses, those of Bizani and Kastritsa, guarding the main southern approaches, along with five smaller forts in a ring around the city, covering the western and northwestern approaches. The forts were well supplied with artillery, totaling some 102 pieces (most of them 87mm). By December 1912, both sides were reinforced: the Ottomans received part of the Vardar Army, retreating after the Battle of Monastir, bringing their forces <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> 35,000, while the Greeks also brought up the 2nd Division from Macedonia and a number of volunteer regiments, for a total of 25,000 men. The Greeks launched a first attack on the fortress area on December 14. The Ottomans succeeded in repelling it in a series of actions that lasted until December 22, and even gained some ground, albeit at the cost of high casualties which depleted their numbers to some 26,000 men.|$|E

25|$|Architecturally speaking, the Behistun {{inscription}} is {{a massive}} project, that entailed cutting into the rough edge of the mountain {{in order to create}} bas-relief figures as seen in the pictures above. The Behistun mountain, rises <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> 1700 feet as part of the Zagros mountain chains in Iran. The mountain's location is ideal being close to both Ecbatana and Babylonia. The bas-relief itself is located some 300 feet above the base of the mountain. The figures represent two of the king's soldiers, the king himself standing over a fallen usurper and captives of several nations possibly dissidents, or co-conspirators. The inscription itself is written in cuneiform character in Old Persian, Babylonian, and Median.|$|E
25|$|It {{was then}} that he joined the All-England Eleven, playing his first game for them at Newark-on-Trent. This meant Caesar would now tour the country, playing cricket, and {{receiving}} somewhere between £4 and £6 from Clarke, from which he {{would also have to}} pay his expenses. Caesar's form dropped, which would have made him more anxious about his place, and he got <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> strange antics at hotels. He became irrationally nervous fearing that someone may have died in his bed, or that the hotel would burn down. One time, after yells from a drunkard outside, Caesar convinced himself that there was a fire and rang the alarm bell, causing minor panic amongst the other guests.|$|E
25|$|Between {{the years}} 741 and 768, the annals overlap with the continuations of the Chronicle of Fredegar. On account of this, {{scholars}} such as Scholz {{have suggested that the}} annals are based on the continuation of Fredegar up to 768, and then on minor annals <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> point between 787 and 793. McKitterick, however, contends that the continuation of Fredegar and the minor annals are more likely based upon the Annales regni Francorum, which is the most ordered and precise of them. Neither argument considers these entries to be contemporaneous with the events described. The manner of reporting for these years is typically terse, though they include the convention of mentioning Easter and Christmas, which continues throughout the annals.|$|E

500|$|Considered {{to be one}} of {{the most}} {{maligned}} players in the Melbourne Football Club's history, Watts' career has been filled with criticism from the media, fans and members of the football industry. The seeds for the ongoing criticism were planted when he was announced as the number one draft pick in the 2008 AFL draft; the hype surrounding him meant that the expectations placed on him before he had even played a match were going to be difficult to live <b>up</b> <b>to.</b> <b>Some</b> of these lofty expectations included being seen as the replacement for club champion, David Neitz, who is the club's games and goals record holder, being labelled as a potential future captain, being one of the team's most valuable players, before he had even played an AFL match, with the club unable to afford him being injured, and claims he was the [...] "great white hope" [...] who would lift the club off the bottom of the ladder.|$|E
500|$|Suppose one accepts, as I do, {{this line}} of {{reasoning}} as justifying governmental action to alleviate poverty; to set, as it were, a floor under the standard of life of every person in the community. [...] arrangement that recommends itself on purely mechanical grounds is a negative income tax.... The advantages of this arrangement are clear. It is directed specifically at the problem of poverty. It gives help in the form most useful to the individual, namely, cash. It is general and could be substituted for the host of special measures now in effect. It makes explicit the cost borne by society. It operates outside the market. Like any other measures to alleviate poverty, it reduces the incentives of those helped to help themselves, but it does not eliminate that incentive entirely, as a system of supplementing incomes <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> fixed minimum would. An extra dollar earned always means more money available for expenditure.|$|E

[...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] features Knowles as the female protagonist impersonating a threatened woman involved in a love triangle. She is unwilling to allow another woman to profit from all the efforts she put on to make her lover a better man.
