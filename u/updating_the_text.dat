5000|$|Reviewing the {{new edition}} in The Times Literary Supplement, David Hunt commented of Fraser, [...] "his wit, {{perhaps a little}} drier and more Scottish, is equally acute, {{diverting}} and instructive". In The Times, Dennis Potter said that the book remained [...] "the happiest thing {{to come out of}} the Treasury". He praised Fraser for replacing Gowers's dated examples of officialese with modern specimens and <b>updating</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> to reflect current trends, but concluded: The core of the book remains Gowers, but I do not think Fraser, for all his desire to be faithful, has been able to keep the urbane, untroubled, effortless grace which made the original so instantly attractive. And, to be fair, the times have made this all but impossible.... The Complete Plain Words in any new version cannot possibly have the same impact as Gowers first had when he reminded administrators that they could best express themselves in a clean and economical prose. But this version, which battles with later jargon and more subtle temptations, a version less sure of the nature of its readership or the mood of the nation, is an honourable and certainly a useful guide.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Suffix {{trees and}} suffix arrays {{are two of}} the most widely used data {{structures}} for text indexing. Each uses linear space and can be constructed in linear time [3, 5 – 7]. However, when it comes to answering queries, the prior does so in O(m log |Σ|) time, where m is the query size, |Σ | is the alphabet size, and the latter does so in O(m + log n), where n is <b>the</b> <b>text</b> size. We propose a novel way of combining the two into, what we call, a suffix tray. The space and construction time remain linear and the query time improves to O(m + log |Σ|). We also consider the online version of indexing, where the indexing structure continues to <b>update</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> online and queries are answered in tandem. Here we suggest a suffix trist, a cross between a suffix tree and a suffix list. It supports queries in O(m + log |Σ|). <b>The</b> space and <b>text</b> <b>update</b> time of a suffix trist are the same as for the suffix tree or the suffix list. ...|$|R

40|$|I {{study the}} {{electronic}} structure and magnetism of postperovskite CaIrO_ 3 using first-principles calculations. The density functional calculations within the local density approximation without the combined effect of spin-orbit coupling and on-site Coulomb repulsion show {{the system to}} be metallic, which is in disagreement with the recent experimental evidences that show CaIrO_ 3 to be an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator in the J_eff = 1 / 2 state. However, when spin-orbit coupling is taken into account, the Ir t_ 2 g bands split into fully filled J_eff = 3 / 2 bands and half-filled J_eff = 1 / 2 bands. I find that spin-orbit coupling along with a modest on-site Coulomb repulsion opens a gap leading to a Mott insulating state. The ordering is antiferromagnetic along the c axis with total moments aligned antiparallel along the c axis and canted along the b axis.
