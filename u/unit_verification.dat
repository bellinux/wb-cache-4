40|$|Background. The {{effects of}} {{different}} practices on fault distributions in evolving complex software systems {{is not fully}} understood. Software reuse and <b>unit</b> <b>verification</b> are prac- tices used to improve system reliability by minimising the number of late faults. Reused software benefits from already being verified while <b>unit</b> <b>verification</b> aims to find faults early. Aims. We want to study effects of software reuse and <b>unit</b> <b>verification</b> on future modifications, fault densities of software units, and fault distributions. Method. We applied statistical analysis {{to a sample of}} 520 units that were reused and modified within four sequential projects from one product line in the telecommunication domain. Results. In reused units, the results of <b>unit</b> <b>verification</b> are correlated to a smaller degree of modifications and decreased fault densities. Conclusion. <b>Unit</b> <b>verification</b> in complex systems may improve system evolution in terms of smaller modifications and decrease of fault densities. The <b>unit</b> <b>verification</b> faults in reused components may be used as predictors of component modification and fault density...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study aims to {{investigate}} the process of monitor <b>unit</b> <b>verification</b> using control charts. Control charts is a key tool within statistical process control (SPC), through which process characteristics can be visualized, usually chronologically with statistically determined limits. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our group has developed a monitor <b>unit</b> <b>verification</b> software that has been adopted at several Swedish institutions for pre-treatment verification of radiotherapy treatments. Deviations between point dose calculations using the treatment planning systems and using the independent monitor <b>unit</b> <b>verification</b> software from 9219 treatment plans and five different institutions were included in this multicenter study. The process of monitor <b>unit</b> <b>verification</b> was divided into subprocesses. Each subprocess was analyzed using probability plots and control charts. RESULTS: Differences in control chart parameters for the investigated subprocesses were found between different treatment sites and different institutions, {{as well as between}} different treatment techniques. 19 of 37 subprocesses met the clinical specification (± 5 %), i. e. process capability index was equal to or above one. CONCLUSIONS: Control charts were found to be a useful tool for continuous analysis of data from the monitor <b>unit</b> <b>verification</b> software for patient specific quality control, as well as for comparisons between different institutions and treatment sites. The derived control chart limits were in agreement with AAPM TG 114 guidelines on action levels...|$|E
40|$|Automated {{verification}} of distributed programs is a challenging problem. Since {{the behavior of}} a distributed program encompasses the behavior of the network, possible configurations of the network have to be investigated during verification. This leads to very large state spaces, and automated verification becomes infeasible. We present a framework that addresses this problem by decoupling the behavior of distributed programs from the behavior of the network. Our framework is based on a set of stub classes that replace native methods used in network communication and enables {{verification of}} distributed Java applications by isolating their behavior from the network. The framework supports two modes of verification: <b>unit</b> <b>verification</b> and integration verification. Integration verification checks multiple interacting distributed application components by running them in a single JVM and simulating the behavior of the network within the same JVM via stub classes. <b>Unit</b> <b>verification</b> targets a single component of a distributed application and requires that the user write an event generator class that utilizes the API exported by the framework. While <b>unit</b> <b>verification</b> only checks a single application component, it benefits from a greatly reduced state space compared do that of integration verification. 1...|$|E

CARA {{is responsible for}} automatically stabilizing a patient’s blood pressure by infusing blood as needed, based on blood-pressure data the CARA system collects.

This paper describes a case study in which a verification tool, the Concurrency Workbench of the New Century (CWB-NC), is used to analyze a model of the CARA system. The huge state space of the CARA makes it problematic to conduct traditional “push-button” automatic verification, such as model checking. Instead, we develop a technique, called <b>unit</b> <b>verification,</b> which entails taking small units of a system, putting them in a “verification harness ” that exercises relevant executions appropriately within the unit, and then model checking these more tractable units.

The system is able to process hundreds of megabytes of image data per second coming from several high-speed/high-resolution cameras. Due to performance requirements, some functionality has been implemented on dedicated hardware based on a field programmable gate array (FPGA), which is coupled to a high-end digital signal processor (DSP). The paper discusses design considerations like partitioning of image processing algorithms between hardware and software. The main chapters focus on functionality implemented on the FPGA, including low-level image processing algorithms (flat-field correction, image pyramid generation, neighborhood operations) and advanced processing units (programmable arithmetic unit, geometry <b>unit).</b> <b>Verification</b> issues for the complex system are also addressed.

These CMNTs {{are part of a}} disturbance reduction system (DRS) on the ESA SMART- 2 Spacecraft or LISA Pathfinder. The goal of the ST 7 DRS is to demonstrate technologies necessary to meet the nanometer precision positioning control requirements of the LISA mission. In order to achieve these goals, the CMNTs are required to demonstrate a thrust resolution of less than 0. 1 micro-N and a thrust noise of less than 0. 1 micro-N/[square root]Hz for thrust levels between 5 and 30 micro-N.

40|$|Some serious {{radiation}} accidents {{have occurred}} {{around the world}} during the delivery of radiotherapy treatment. The regrettable incident in Panama clearly indicated the need for independent monitor unit (MU) verification. Indeed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), after investigating the incident, made specific recommendations for radiotherapy centres which included an independent monitor unit check for all treatments. Independent monitor <b>unit</b> <b>verification</b> is practiced in many radiotherapy centres in developed countries around the world. It is mandatory in USA but not yet in Australia. This paper describes development of an independent MU program, concentrating on {{the implementation of the}} Enhanced Dynamic Wedge (EDW) component. The difficult case of non centre of field (COF) calculation points under the EDW was studied in some detail. Results of a survey of Australasian centres regarding the use of independent MU check systems is also presented. The system was developed with reference to MU calculations made by Pinnacle 3 D Radiotherapy Treatment Planning (RTP) system (ADAC - Philips) for 4 MV, 6 MV and 18 MV X-ray beams used at the Newcastle Mater Misericordiae Hospital (NMMH) in the clinical environment. A small systematic error was detected in the equation used for the EDW calculations. Results indicate that COF equations may be used in the non COF situation with similar accuracy to that achieved with profile corrected methods. Further collaborative work with other centres is planned to extend these findings...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} aimed to compare {{accuracy}} of monitor <b>unit</b> <b>verification</b> in intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) using 6 MV photons by three different methodologies with different detector phantom combinations.

Actual gantry and couch angle plans were also measured in water phantom using 0. 6 cc chamber. A suitable point of measurement was chosen from the beam profile for each field. When the zero-degree gantry, couch angle plans and actual gantry, couch angle plans were measured by 0. 6 cc chamber in water phantom, the percentage mean difference (MD) was 1. 35 &#x 0025;, 2. 94 &#x 0025; and Standard Deviation (SD) was 2. 99 &#x 0025;, 5. 22 &#x 0025;, respectively.

40|$|Preparation for {{radiotherapy}} is {{a complex}} procedure that involves many different technologies and groups of professionals. The rapid development and introduction of new technologies throughout the last decade {{have made it possible}} to deliver highly conformal, individually-shaped dose distributions with high accuracy. However, there is widespread concern that current quality assurance practices have not been updated at the pace necessary to provide adequate and cost-effective safeguards against treatment delivery errors. The overall aim of this thesis was to develop and evaluate new, efficient tools for patient-specific quality assurance of the radiotherapy process, including the following areas: transfer of information, independent monitor <b>unit</b> <b>verification,</b> pre-treatment measurements, in vivo dosimetry, and end-to-end tests. Within the framework of the thesis, a concept for ensuring data integrity was proposed and used to compare different combinations of treatment planning systems and record-and-verify systems with respect to data integrity. Because the concept is based on the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) global information standard, it is generally applicable to most radiotherapy computer systems. Additionally, a software for monitor unit verifications was developed, and the tools within Statistical Process Control were used to analyse calculation results from this software in a multicentre study. Time-resolved dosimetry systems were developed and applied to pre-treatment measurements and in vivo dosimetry, allowing rigorous analysis of the accuracy of the treatment planning and delivery systems and forming a basis for real-time in vivo dosimetry. Finally, gel dosimetry and anthropomorphic phantoms were demonstrated to provide important tools for complete end-to-end tests. The tools developed in this thesis have two important applications: routine use in daily clinical practice, and when introducing new technologies in the local clinical setting. The proposed methods and concepts can improve patient safety and reduce the resources required for a comprehensive quality assurance program...|$|E

Using other techniques, it is proved that finite Rickart C∗-algebras, strongly π-regular von Neumann regular rings, and strongly π-regular rings in which every element is a sum of a unit plus a central unit, all have stable range 1. Finally, for an arbitrary commutative ring some overrings with specified stable range properties are constructed, in particular a more or less canonical overring having stable range 1...|$|R
