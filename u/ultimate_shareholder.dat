Related party transactions' intensity allows minority holders' expropriation right and affects company's value. This study aimed to analyze the determinants affecting related party transactions’ intensity in companies in the business groups in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The determinants were ultimate shareholders, good corporate governance (with independent commissioner and the Big Four public accounting firms as proxies), debt to equity ratio, and period of crisis. This study used panel data with quarterly time period from 2006 to 2013. Samples were determined by purposive sampling focusing on companies’ typology, namely companies in the three business groups representing the market capitalization’s three layers. The results showed that ultimate shareholders insignificantly had positive effect on related party transactions’ intensity. Independent commisioners and debt to equity ratio significantly had positive effect on related party transactions’ intensity. The Big Four public accounting firms significantly had negative effect on related party transactions’ intensity.

I use unbalanced panel data from more than 1, 300 Chinese A-share listed companies over 2005 - 2009 and find that performance, especially one of market-based measurement, has {{a significant impact on}} CEO compensation. CEO compensation levels have risen in recent years due to economic gains rather than poor corporate governance. Firms that operate under other central government ministries (SOECG) than those of the <b>ultimate</b> <b>shareholder</b> do not use performance as a guideline for CEO pay, although they have the highest CEO compensation level amongst all five groups. The size of the board directors and independent directors are contributes positively to CEO compensation. While the degree of ownership concentration and size of supervision board are negative related to CEO compensation. Moreover, CEO gets higher pay if independent direct especially financial one working province is same as companies headquarter. Most of these results are consistent with my hypothesis. Shareholders, managers, government, and others who must make improvements in China’s corporate governance standards should find these results useful.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is twofold. First, we put together, for the first time, {{quantitative}} measures {{on the quality of the}} corporate governance and the ownership structure for 65 non-financial listed companies in Argentina with information for 2003 - 2004. A wide array of official and private sources were used to this purpose. In a nutshell, companies seem to be poorly governed vis-à-vis international practices. In turn, ownership appears to be quite concentrated at the level of the largest <b>ultimate</b> <b>shareholder,</b> but separation of control and cash flow rights prevails in less than half of the companies, with pyramiding being the main mechanism to create such wedge. Second, we put to the test the predictions of recent theories linking those measures with corporate performance and dividend policy in 2000 - 2003. Concerning performance, the results point to a sizable and robust effect of our governance measure on both the return on assets and Tobin s q. Moreover, the separation of control and cash flow rights for the largest shareholder-an indicator of the incentives to expropriate minority shareholders- hinders performance directly, and also attenuates the beneficial impact from good governance rules. When it comes to dividends, only our governance measure appears to exert a positive and marked effect on the cash dividend-to-cash flow ratio.

In chapter one, I find that corporate layers are set up to limit government control and interference in government-controlled listed companies. I document {{that the development of}} markets, legal systems and property rights protection in a region is associated with more corporate layers, limiting the control of government as an <b>ultimate</b> <b>shareholder.</b> Market developments and political incentives to interfere business are associated with fewer layers, allowing government to control the firms through direct ownership. The opposite is true for privately-controlled firms. The lack of development in markets, legal systems and property rights protection is associated with more layers in privately-controlled firms, which are used for hiding the identity and/or wealth of ultimate private owners and shielding them from government predation. In chapter two, listed companies are found to be more transparent when they get away from government through setting up more corporate layers in government-controlled firms. More layers between government agencies and listed companies are associated with stronger earnings-return relation. The corporate layers in government-controlled firms emerge as a mechanism to confine political interference and enhance corporate transparency. In companies controlled by private owners, the earnings do not have any explanatory power for stock returns and corporate layers are not associated with the firms' earnings-return relation.

40|$|The high {{separation}} of ownership from control achieved through the concurrent use of non-voting shares and stock pyramiding could favor acquisitions made to increase private {{benefits of the}} controlling shareholders rather than all shareholders’ wealth. A standard event study methodology is carried out on three different samples of Italian acquisitions during the 1989 – 1996 period {{in order to test}} this hypothesis. We find evidence that a worse market reaction characterizes acquiring firms with a higher {{separation of}} ownership from control, while more value-enhancing transactions are undertaken by those smaller in size and with higher prior-performance. An entrenchment effect seems to determine a significant U-shaped relationship between the market reaction and the <b>ultimate</b> <b>shareholder</b> ownership. When the sample is restricted to acquiring firms with a dual class equity structure we find that non-voting shares report significantly negative excess returns in contrast to significantly higher positive returns for voting shares. Such evidence seems to indicate that the average acquisition has been overpaid, as suggested by the negative market reaction of the non-voting shares, while it was expected to lead to higher private benefits to the majority shareholders, as suggested by the revaluation of the voting shares. Finally, the market reaction to acquisitions made within pyramidal groups seems to indicate that the price is set so as to transfer wealth towards the companies located at the upper levels, where majority shareholders own greater fractions of the companies’ cash flows.

40|$|AbstractThe {{association}} between corporate governance and firm value {{has been extensively}} studied in Chinese listed firms. Based {{on the characteristics of}} their <b>ultimate</b> <b>shareholders,</b> Chinese listed firms can be categorised as (1) central state-controlled, (2) local state-controlled or (3) non-state-controlled. Some scholars have described Chinese government policy as ‘zhuada fangxiao’, thus suggesting that the corporate governance mechanisms (CGMs) of central state-controlled listed firms (SCLFs) are better than those of local state-controlled listed firms. Therefore, this paper specifically examines the influence of CGMs on the value of central SCLFs and local SCLFs. Analysis of 2006 firm-year observations from 2007 to 2009 suggests that the aggregate ownership of other large shareholders and the remuneration of top executives exhibit different effects on firm value in central and local SCLFs. The results also provide evidence that there is no endogenous effect of firm value on the ownership of the largest shareholder in central and local SCLFs...|$|R

Related party transaction is an important corporate action with the highest incidence rate of all corporate actions of the companies in the business groups listed in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The study in general aimed to analyze aggregate-based related party transactions and other determinants that affect the firm value of the companies in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The study, specifically on each business group, aimed to: (1) analyze the related party transactions influenced by the <b>ultimate</b> <b>shareholder</b> ownership structure, good corporate governance, debt to equity ratio and period of crisis, (2) analyze the types and patterns of related party transactions, control variable and period of crisis that affect firm value, and (3) analyze the impacts of macroeconomic variables in the forms of oil price, interest rates, exchange rates, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), business cycle and period of crisis that affect firm value. The results of the aggregate-based study are: (1) {{a greater proportion of}} ultimate shareholders with the support of good corporate governance will create the perspective of efficient transactions, but the opposite situation will create the perspective of conflict of interest, (2) the profit-loss accounts which positively affect firm value show a propping pattern; on the contrary, the balance sheet accounts which negatively affect firm value show a tunneling pattern; bigger firm does not ensure better corporate governance, so it can elevate firm value; DER shows that related party transactions are thick with thin capitalization nuance, and (3) oil price is significantly positive in affecting firm value; interest rates are significantly negative in affecting firm value; exchange rates are significantly positive in affecting firm value; GDP is significantly negative in affecting firm value which is caused by the consumption supporting GDP but not investment, the speculative liquidity preference of foreign investors and the lack of financial literacy of household investors; business cycle is significantly positive (parallel) in affecting firm value, and period of crisis is significantly negative in affecting firm value.

Empiricamente, LaFond e Roychowdhury (2008), Sánchez, Alemán e Martín (2011), Ramalingegowda e Yu (2012) e Haw, Ho, Tong e Zhang (2012) representam os principais trabalhos internacionalmente. No Brasil, Sarlo Neto, Rodrigues e Almeida (2010), até a publicação da tese, era o único trabalho nessa linha de pesquisa. Quatro características da estrutura de propriedade foram investigadas: a) concentração de direitos de votos pelo maior acionista último; b) divergência entre direitos de votos e fluxo de caixa do maior acionista último; c) presença de segundo maior acionista que não faz parte do bloco de controle; e d) controle exercido por meio de estruturas de propriedade piramidais. Os acordos entre acionistas foram levados em consideração nos cálculos. Ainda, as variáveis de estrutura de propriedade foram obtidas por meio das participações diretas e indiretas, a fim de o maior acionista último ser claramente identificado. Em relação ao conservadorismo, foram empregadas quatro métricas: duas advindas de Basu (1997) e as outras duas provenientes da pesquisa de Ball e Shivakumar (2005) e Khan e Watts (2009). Ademais, foram utilizadas as seguintes variáveis de controle nos modelos empíricos: tamanho, endividamento, market-to-book, governança corporativa e risco de litígio. O período da análise abrangeu dados de 2010 a 2013. Após o processo de seleção da amostra, restaram 260 companhias, que perfizeram um total de 887 observações. Para estimar a relação entre as variáveis foi empregada a técnica de dados em painel com efeitos fixos das unidades individuais e do tempo. Os resultados dos testes não indicaram haver efeito sistemático e significativo das características de estrutura de propriedade sobre o conservadorismo contábil.

This {{research supports}} {{the thesis that}} the companiesównership structure influences the accounting conservatism of Brazilian public companies listed on the stock exchange. Theoretical suggestions and recent empirical evidence support such defense. Empirically, LaFond and Roychowdhury (2008), Sánchez, Alemán and Martín (2011), Ramalingegowda and Yu (2012) and Haw, Ho, Tong and Zhang (2012) represent the main international research studies. In Brazil, the work done by Sarlo Neto, Rodrigues and Almeida (2010), was the only study in this line of research until the publication of this PhD dissertation. For this dissertation, four components of the ownership structure were investigated: a) concentration of voting rights for the largest ultimate shareholder; b) divergence between voting rights and cash flow of the largest ultimate shareholder; c) presence of a second largest shareholder that {{is not part of}} the controlling block; and d) control exercised through properties of pyramidal structures. Shareholderságreements were taken into account in the calculations. In addition, the variables of ownership structure were obtained by direct and indirect equity participations, in order to clearly identify the largest shareholder. Regarding conservatism, four metrics were used: two coming from Basu (1997) and the other two from the studies conducted by Ball and Shivakumar (2005) and Watts and Khan (2009). In addition, the following control variables were used in the empirical models: size, leverage, market-to-book ratio, corporate governance and risk of litigation. The period of analysis covered data from 2010 to 2013. After the sample selection process, 260 companies remained, which resulted in a total of 887 observations. To estimate the relationship among the variables we used panel data analysis with fixed effects of individual units and time. Each component of the ownership structure was regressed individually on models. The test results did not indicate a systematic and significant effect of ownership structure components on accounting conservatism. Nevertheless, this dissertation presents contributions at both international and national levels. Compared with international studies in the same research line, this dissertation is the first to consider the effects of shareholderságreements in the calculation of ownership structure variables. Moreover, it is also the first to test the effects of pyramidal structures on the property of conservatism. Nationally, the research contributes to the extensive line about the ownership structure by considering the effect of the second largest <b>ultimate</b> <b>shareholder,</b> hitherto unheard of in the national literature.

I find that divergence between control rights and cash flow rights is associated with over-investment in capital expenditure. These rights affect innovation in R&D, though the effect on capital expenditure and R&D spending are in opposite directions within Korean firms, prior to the East Asian Economic Crisis. These results imply that the ownership structure {{in the context of a}} poor governance system encourages 'empire-building' and the neglect of investment in firm innovation. Furthermore, I find that debt financing is more important than cash flow-investment sensitivity. This affected investment in both affiliated firms and independent firms in the process of financial liberalisation and deregulation during the 10 years prior to the East Asian Economic Crisis.;Essay 3 : Ownership Structure, Diversification and Firm Value in Korean Companies: This study analyses the diversification effect of ownership structure and compares the effect of diversification on the performance of Korean affiliated firms (top 30 Chaebol) with its effect on independent firms in 10 years of panel data (1988 - 1997). The divergence between the cash flow rights and the control rights of <b>ultimate</b> <b>shareholders</b> affects firm diversification. Group affiliated firms have stronger a agency cost problem than creating internal capital market during the 10 years sample period but diversification for independent firms create the advantage for internal capital market in less developed capital markets. Additionally, I find the divergence between control rights and cash flow affects the diversification, diversification affects corporate value, but firm value does not affect the ownership structure in a 2 SLS test...|$|R
40|$|There is {{emerging}} corporate governance {{research on the}} problem of conflict of interest between shareholders (i. e., the principal-principal problem). This problem concerns the phenomenon of the <b>ultimate</b> controlling <b>shareholder</b> expropriating (Tunneling) or injecting (propping) funds through related-party transactions (RPTs) in a way that prejudices the rights of minority shareholders. The area of corporate governance that deals with minority shareholder protection is under-researched. Most corporate governance research treats shareholders as a homogeneous party (i. e., the principal) whose common rights are to be served by the agent (management and the board). However, the protection of minority shareholders’ interests, in balance with all shareholders of the firm, {{is one of the key}} corporate governance principles. Ways in which this study seeks to contribute to the literature concerning the principal-principal problem are threefold: (a) extend the evidence and understanding of governance problems in the context of developing and transitioning countries where the protection of minority shareholders from prejudicial actions by an <b>ultimate</b> controlling <b>shareholder</b> or set of block-holders and the executive management team has been identified as the primary problem (Shleifer and Vishny 1997; Johnson, Lopez-de-silanes, La Porta and Shleifer 2000); (b) develop stronger theoretical underpinning for the specification of models when empirically investigating relationships between corporate governance practices, ownership concentration, regulatory systems and the actions of controlling shareholders in developing and transitioning countries; and (c) establish improved measures used as proxies for the prejudicial proportion of total RPTs and for theory-driven concepts that can explain the extent of Tunneling and propping phenomena as manifest in prejudicial RPTs. The main aim of this study, therefore, is to test theory-driven models of motivating and enabling influences on the extent of prejudicial RPTs. A supplementary aim is to update the descriptive evidence on the incidence and categorisation of RPTs in China. In respect of the main aim, the following lines of investigation are pursued: (a) the <b>ultimate</b> controlling <b>shareholder’s</b> motivation for undertaking Tunneling from the perspective of Bebchuk’s (1999) rent-protection theory of corporate ownership structure; (b) the <b>ultimate</b> controlling <b>shareholder’s</b> motivation for undertaking propping from the perspective of Jensen and Ruback’s (1983) ‘market for ownership control’ theory; and (c) the enabling influences of corporate governance practices on Tunneling and propping in a transitional economy with high government ownership from the perspectives of reverse bonding theory between controlling shareholders and agents, and the theory of markets in transition (Nee 1989) where power and privilege is perpetuated into the private sector from former State regimes. This study is set in the context of contemporary China. A background review is provided to the context of corporations, shareholders and capital markets in China. This includes a brief history of economic and accounting changes, the development of securities markets and shares classifications, and the establishment of a corporate governance code including aspect of minority shareholders protection in China. Hypotheses and models are constructed to test the extent to which motivating and enabling/inhibiting factors can explain or predict the extent of Tunneling and propping, respectively. A positivist epistemology is adopted. China is chosen as the context because it is a major transitional economy, has a large share market, high State-ownership and questionable implementation of securities regulations. Data is sourced mainly from the China Securities Market and Accounting Research (CSMAR) database on listed companies in China. The sample is drawn from a census of all companies listed on the Shenzhen and Shanghai Stock Exchanges in 2010. After making various exclusions, the sample size is 1, 967 listed companies. Data is collected for 2010, which means that cross-sectional analysis is undertaken. Correlations and regressions are the main form of data analysis. Apart from analysing data for the sample as a whole, comparisons are made between groupings of State versus non-State controlled companies, and larger versus smaller companies. The results reveal several significant determinants of prejudicial RPTs. The influences from the findings are briefly discussed. First, in terms of the motivating conditions for Tunneling, results suggests that when <b>ultimate</b> controlling <b>shareholders</b> can not satisfy their cashflow rights through non-prejudicial means (i. e., voting rights high relative to cashflow rights or low dividend payout), they tend to resort to Tunneling. This provides evidence in support of Bebchuk’s (1999) rent-protection theory of ownership control. Alternatively, in terms of motivating conditions for propping, the reporting of prior net losses by the company, which can lead to the CSRC imposing ‘special status’ penalty, thereby triggering the emergence of a market for ownership control, is the primary motivator for propping. This provides support for Jensen and Ruback’s (1983) market for ownership control theory. Second, in terms of enabling mechanisms for Tunneling results reveal that Tunneling is higher when the controlling shareholder is a ‘cadre entrepreneur’ (i. e, a person with high status in the former State-owned regime who has become a successful entrepreneur in the current market-based regime) and the Chair of the Board has high ‘path dependency’ on the <b>ultimate</b> controlling <b>shareholder.</b> This supports both Nee’s (1989) theory of market transition in which power and privilege is perpetuated in cadre entrepreneurs’ and the notion of reverse bonding in which the board is bonded by the controlling shareholder. Alternatively, significant enabling mechanisms for propping are revealed as a high level of emoluments of the top executive team and a high ‘path dependency’ of the CEO on the <b>ultimate</b> controlling <b>shareholder.</b> This adds further support for the notion of bonding to the <b>ultimate</b> controlling <b>shareholder</b> which cuts out protection of minority shareholders’ interests. These results are discussed, not only in terms of their support for underlying theories, but also in terms of their practical implications for securities regulations and governance practices in China concerning the principal-principal problem. In particular, China’s securities regulations concerning special listing treatment when losses are reported and also the holding of non-tradable shares have the side-effect of motivating controlling shareholders to engage in propping. These CSRC regulations on listed companies, therefore, need to be reviewed in order to address the principal-principal shareholder problem. In the broader area of implementing corporate governance guidelines, the issue of independence of directors needs to be reviewed if better protection of all shareholders rights is to be achieved. Limitations arise from the difficulty of measuring the concept of prejudicial RPTs, the restricting of the evidence to the context of China only and a single year, and the potential for endogeniety in some elements of the models...|$|R
40|$|We {{present data}} on {{ownership}} structures of large corporations in 27 wealthy economies, {{making an effort}} to identify the <b>ultimate</b> controlling <b>shareholders</b> of these firms. We find that, except in economies with very good shareholder protection, relatively few of these firms are widely held, in contrast to the Berle and Means image of ownership of the modern corporation. Rather, these firms are typically controlled by families or the State. Equity control by financial institutions or other widely held corporations is far less common. The controlling shareholders typically have power over firms significantly in excess of their cash flow rights, primarily through the use of pyramids and participation in management...|$|R
40|$|Management {{ownership}} has ethical consequences {{because it}} has an interest alignment effect or an entrenchment effect. In this paper, we investigate the ethical consequences of management ownership in China using accounting conservatism as the direct measure of entrenchment and alignment between shareholders and managers. We argue and find that the ethical effect of management ownership differs significantly in firms with different <b>ultimate</b> controlling <b>shareholders.</b> Specifically, management ownership in non-state-owned enterprises (NSOEs) has an alignment effect, while management ownership has less of an alignment effect in state-owned enterprises than in NSOEs. These {{results show that the}} ethical consequences of management ownership are moderated by the nature of ultimate controlling ownership...|$|R
