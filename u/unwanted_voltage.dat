Protection is provided to control <b>unwanted</b> <b>voltages</b> that usually generate in associated electrical circuits by a multi-junction ceramic in a voltage dependent varistor. The ceramic's microstructure consists of ZnO grains that are surrounded by the narrow boundaries of melted specific additives such as Bi 2 O 3, TiO 2 and Sb 2 O 3. In fact, the boundaries manage the quality of protection through a certain volume of intrinsic oxygen vacancies transformation which depends on the amounts of the additives. Since these amounts are the ceramic fabrication's initial input variables, the optimization process is capable of {{improving the quality of}} the protection (non-linear coefficient) as an output of the varistor devices. In this work, the fabrication was designed and then experimentally performed to calculate the non-linear coefficients of the produced varistors as actual responses. The responses were used to obtain an appropriate model for the fabrication by different semi-empirical methods. Afterward, the models predicted the optimized amounts of the additives which maximized the quality of the varistors. The predicted condition was fabricated as final varistors that were electrically characterized to compare their nonlinear coefficients as the quality indicator. The comparison demonstrated that the optimized amounts of Bi 2 O 3 (0. 5), TiO 2 (0. 47) and Sb 2 O 3 (0. 21) in mol% provided the very high protective varistor with nonlinear coefficients of 28. 1.

In this project a complete system for makingmeasurements with Hall-sensors has been developed and tested on three generators. Twoof the generators were hydropower generators of 50 and 90 MVA. The measurementsystem is comprised of hall-sensors, power supply and a connection units as well as acalibration unit. 9 V lithium-batteries are powering the system making it easy to setupin any environment.

40|$|The {{potentially}} harmful impacts of electromagnetic interference EMI) {{on the safe}} operation of electronic and electrical equipment are drawing serious attention due to reliance on electrical and electronic devices in telecommunication, mobile phone networks, radar systems, banking, public defence, and others. Em induces <b>unwanted</b> <b>voltage</b> and currents on the victim device, thus affecting {{the performance of the}} devices. Electromagnetic shielding which is commonly applied as the last resort in reducing the radiated emission hrn digital circuibies is switching its territory to building construction in an attempt to provide similar benefits to the sensitive and critical equipment inside the building. It is reported that concrete constructed with different weight fractions of material, moisture content (MC), and the effect of reinforcement bar will produce different shielding effectiveness (SE). The parameters that determine the SE of building materials include their dielectric constant, loss tangent and relative permeability. These parameters can be obtained based on dielectric measurement. Dielectric measurements need to be repeated when the composition of the building material changes. In this work, the SE of cement powder with additional additives, such as graphite powder, iron powder and nickelzinc ferrite powder were investigated. It has been found that dielectric constant determines the trend. of the reflection loss as it plays significant roles in establishing the characteristic impedance of the material. On the other hand, absorption loss and multipIe reflection loss are more dependent on the thickness of material. Based on the results, it is recognised that graphite powder is an efficient and practical additive in enhancing the SE of cement power compared with others. Cement-graphite powder provides more than 60 dB of shielding in between 200 MHz to 2000 MHz when the percentage ofthe graphite powder in the mixture is 30 % and the thickness is 10 cm. Novel predictions, which are based on the neural network and piece-wise fitting has been proposed to predict the SE of cement-graphite mixture with different percentages of graphite powder. SE predictions which are based on piece-wise fitting and neural network produces 1. 94 dB and 0. 029 dB of error at 900 MHz and 1800 hfI-h respectively when it is used to predict the SE of cement-graphite that contains a 17 % of graphite in between 100 MHz to 2000 MHz. In summary, this research investigates the effect of different additives on the SE of cement powder. The prediction based on the neural network indicates a sample with a thickness of 7 cm and 30 % graphite is able to provide above 40 dB of shielding ranging between 100 MHz and 2000 MHz. Such prediction can be anticipated for implementation in building construction design...|$|E
40|$|Falta palabras clavesThe {{study of}} {{multiphase}} machines applications is an emergent {{field of research}} {{mainly because of the}} high reliability they offer for high power applications. Nowadays, they are predominantly supplied from two-level voltage source inverters (VSIs). For the purpose of the inverter control, both carrier-based and space vector pulse width modulation (PWM) techniques have been developed, for various phase numbers, which are capable of generating required sinusoidal output voltages. Both methods are usually a general extension of modulation methods used in the three-phase case. The relationship between continuous carrier-based and space vector PWM has been reported in the scientific literature for the multiphase case, stating analogies and differences. Discontinuous PWM techniques for multiphase inverters have also received some attention as well, but at a lesser extent than the continuous PWM techniques, always in relation to multiphase systems. In this work for filling aforementioned gap, discontinuous modulation methods are first analysed in multiphase drives. The natural consequence of the existence of different PWM strategies is the inherently different behaviour with regard to the performance indicators {{that can be used to}} assess the quality of output waveforms. Among these performance indicators, one of the most interesting used in three phase induction machines for the evaluation of switching characteristics and the current ripple are the ux harmonic distortion factor (HDF). However, HDF has been only very recently introduced in the multiphase case, and for asymmetrical six-phase induction machines that can be considered like two three phase machines in the same case. Consequently, there is quite few work in the scientific literature and the multiphase induction machine case in the evaluation of switching characteristics and the current ripple using HDF. Therefore, the extension of HDF for the evaluation of switching characteristics and the current ripple in the multiphase case is studied and analysed like a second main goal of this Thesis. Notice that SVM has been also extended to the multiphase case. However, most scientific literature relates the general case, where linear operation regions are only considered. A third goal of the work is the extension of the operation region of the SVM-multiphase scheme. In this field, non linear operation in the overmodulation region is also considered, guaranteeing a smooth and linear transition characteristic between linear and overmodulation regions, minimizing the <b>unwanted</b> <b>voltage</b> amplitude of low order voltage harmonic components. Then, a simple algorithm is proposed with the ability to minimize xy voltage and current components in any multiphase induction machine with any odd number of phases. Finally, the reduction of Common Mode Voltage (CMV) is an interesting topic in the modulation techniques field because it is known to be the cause of electromagnetic interference (EMI), breakdown of windings insulation, fault activation of current detector circuits and leakage currents problems that can damage the motor bearings. The commonmode voltage issue is also studied in this Thesis, and a SVM method is proposed to minimize its content in the electromechanical system.

Fast {{switching}} transients and common mode voltage generated by a PWM inverter cause <b>unwanted</b> shaft <b>voltage</b> and resultant bearing currents. Parasitic capacitive coupling creates a path to discharge current in rotors and bearings. In order to analyze bearing current discharges and their effect on bearing damage under different conditions, calculation of the capacitive coupling between the outer and inner races is needed. During motor operation, the distances between the balls and races may change the capacitance values. Due to changing of the thickness and spatial distribution of the lubricating grease, this capacitance {{does not have a}} constant value and is known to change with speed and load. Thus, the resultant electric field between the races and balls varies with motor speed. The lubricating grease in the ball bearing cannot withstand high voltages and a short circuit through the lubricated grease can occur. At low speeds, because of gravity, balls and shaft voltage may shift down and the system (ball positions and shaft) will be asymmetric. In this study, two different asymmetric cases (asymmetric ball position, asymmetric shaft position) are analyzed and the results are compared with the symmetric case. The objective {{of this paper is to}} calculate the capacitive coupling and electric fields between the outer and inner races and the balls at different motor speeds in symmetrical and asymmetrical shaft and balls positions. The analysis is carried out using finite element simulations to determine the conditions which will increase the probability of high rates of bearing failure due to current discharges through the balls and races. ...|$|R

In equipment design, one important issue is compliance with relevant EMC standards. Effects such as crosstalk, reflections on transmission lines, impulse noise as the simultaneous transition of levels, electrostatic discharge, current spike and radiation or elec-tromagnetic radiation should be considered when using high-speed integrated circuits. These effects combined with the nonlinear characteristics of passive components can cause an erro-neous operation at the component level, subsystem and system.

Every electrically device has the potential of causing unintentional interference to other electrical devices. All <b>unwanted</b> currents or <b>voltages</b> that may arise in a system generate electrical noise. All kinds of unexpected radio-frequency (RF) energy produce this kind of noise. The term Electromagnetic Interference [...] EMI [...] describes the situation that electrical noise destroys the functionality of systems.

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} (BiySb 1 -y) 2 Te 3 nanocomposites {{as an example}} of the {{currently}} available nano systems. In this thesis, (BiySb-y) 2 Te 3 nanocomposites are characterized from ~ 325 K down to ~ 3 K. Advantages of this low temperature regime include the minimization of lattice vibrations and the decreasing of ke with decreasing temperature. As a result, nano effects on IL could be better observed and characterized in this low temperature regime. We are also interested in studying the effect of an applied magnetic field on the conduction carriers in this low temperature regime. We like to find out whether an applied magnetic field could impede the carriers' heat conducting ability more than their current conducting ability. Therefore, a magnetic field effect study is also carried out to see whether any improvement in ZT could be achieved by the applying of a magnetic field. The measurement system used in this thesis is QD PPMS. Only the ACT and TTO options of the QD PPMS apparatus are used for measurements in this thesis. Under the ACT option, Hall and 4 -pt p measurements on the same sample are performed. On the other hand, Kti, S, and 2 -pt p measurements are performed simultaneously on the same sample under the TTO option. Both the ACT and TTO options use an AC current instead of a DC current during p measurement to eliminate any <b>unwanted</b> Seebeck <b>voltage.</b> Since the ability to perform correct measurements on thermoelectric samples is not a trivial task, benchmarking with known results is a must. In this thesis, I calibrate our QD PPMS against both the manufacturer's results and the published data, and demonstrate that our measurement system gives accurate results. I also benchmark our nt, results under a magnetic field using a pyrex sample. Our results confirm that the QD PPMS apparatus does not introduce artifacts under an applied magnetic field. Thus, any changes observed under the QD PPMS apparatus measurements in an applied magnetic field would be expected to be solely due to the sample. Lastly, no measurable difference is found between our 2 -pt p (TTO) and 4 -pt p (ACT) measurements. A total of eight (BiySb 1 -y) 2 Te 3 samples are measured in this thesis. The sample set includes: (a) one bulk ingot sample manufactured by Marlow (Ingot), (b) four nanocomposite samples (XY 21, XY 146, XY 144, and GJ 99) made by collaborators from Boston College (BC) where the letters simply indicate the sample maker's initials, and (c) three nanocomposite samples (0 %, 40 %, and 100 %) made by collaborators from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore, where the % denotes the weight % of the nanoinclusions prepared via melt spinning [1] in the sample. All the nanocomposite samples in this thesis are made solely for research uses and are purposely fabricated under conditions different than those used for the best samples previously reported [2, 1]. Although BC and NTU use different starting materials, different fabrication machines, and different fabrication parameters, the resulting densities of the nanocomposites from the ball-milled nanopowders alone (XY 21, XY 146, XY 144, GJ 99, and 0 %) are almost identical. Moreover, the addition of nanoinclusions prepared via melt spinning decreases the sample mass density somewhat. (cont.) From the XRD measurement results, we notice that (a) both the NTU and BC samples have the same XRD peak locations, (b) the NTU samples have a lower intensity for peaks (1 0 10) and (1 1 0), and (c) the NTU samples have a higher intensity for peaks (0 0 g) where g is an integer. Comparing the XRD patterns with the reference database, the difference in peak intensities is a good indication that the NTU samples are not completely randomized and have internal preferred orientations. From the SEM images, we notice that the NTU samples and the BC samples are markedly different. For example, the BC samples are shown to have grains in the pm range with a small grain size distribution. On the other hand, the grain sizes of the NTU samples decreases with the addition of nanoinclusions prepared via melt spinning. Moreover, the NTU samples have a wider grain size distribution that ranges from nm to pum. This observed difference is believed to arise from the difference in the fabrication techniques used by the BC and NTJ teams. Temperature-dependent hta, S, and p measurements, along with the carrier concentration measurements, are performed on all samples. All samples are found to be p-type materials. Transport measurements are performed both // and I to the press direction for the nanocomposite samples, and only // to the growth direction for the Ingot sample. Anisotropic behavior is observed in ~tha nd p for all the nanocomposite samples investigated, with the anisotropy being always higher in p than in th. On the other hand, S is found to be isotropic. Thus, care needs be taken during the fabrication process to ensure that no unwanted anisotropic behavior is introduced. Common p and S features among all samples include: (a) a dramatic decrease in the peak value of sth for the nanocomposite samples when compared with the Ingot //'s value, (b) constant slope &S/&T for T OK (completely degenerate limit of (+_) 2). Furthermore, the higher the hole concentration the sample has, the higher its C value is at a given temperature. Lastly, I find that a lower f leads to higher ZT values at 297 K for the BC nanocomposite samples measured in the _L direction. On the other hand, a lower f leads to lower ZT values at 297 K for the NTU nanocomposite samples measured in both the // and _L directions. From the magnetic field studies on the Ingot and on the 40 % samples, few important facts are demonstrated. First, an applied magnetic field can be used to effectively increase the ZT of (BiySbpy) 2 Te 3, especially at temperatures below 200 K. Use of a magnetic field might theoretically extend the effective temperature ranges over which (BiySb-y) 2 Te 3 materials can be used for refrigeration. Second, the data under various applied B fields allow me to confidently calculate the C value below the temperature ranges where a plateau has occurred. Third, the data under various applied B fields serve as an important guideline for both validating any electron model and extrapolating values for L above the plateau occurrence temperatures. As a result, this allows me to get some insights into the temperature dependence of L (see Figure 4 - 14). Fourth, from the magnetic field dependent transport studies on our samples, we observe that the applied B field pushes away the holes more effectively in the Ingot // than the holes in the nanocomposite samples. We also find that the VvtIplateau values obtained under the magnetic field study serve as a more realistic and practical limit for KL. Lastly, from the magnetic field-dependent studies, we find that having point defects as the dominant scattering mechanism for the carriers results in an increase in ZT under an applied magnetic field. It would be extremely useful if one can make a sample such that the point defect dominant regime is extended to higher temperatures, resulting in a shift of the increase in the ZT ratio regime to a temperature range closer to room temperature (300 K). However, care needs to be taken to ensure that such modifications would result in an increase in the ZT values under an applied magnetic field. by Ming Y. Tang. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Multilevel {{inverter}} technology has emerged {{recently as a}} very important alternative {{in the area of}} high-power medium-voltage energy control. Voltage operation above semiconductor device limits, lower common mode voltages, near sinusoidal outputs together with small dv/dt’s, are some of the characteristics that have made this power converters popular for industry and modern research. However, the existing solutions suffer from some inherent drawbacks like common mode voltage problem, DC-link capacitor voltage fluctuation etc. Cascaded multi-level inverter with open-end winding induction motor structure promises significant improvements for high power medium-voltage applications. This dissertation investigates such cascaded multi-level inverters for open-end winding induction motor drive with reduced switch count. Similar to the conventional two-level inverters, other multi-level inverters with PWM control generate alternating common mode voltage (CMV). The alternating common mode voltage coupled through the parasitic capacitors in the machine and results in excessive bearing current and shaft <b>voltage.</b> The <b>unwanted</b> shaft <b>voltage</b> may cross the limit of insulation breakdown voltage and cause motor failure. This alternating common mode voltage adds to the total leakage current through ground conductor and acts as a source of conducted EMI which can interfere with other electronic equipments around. As the number of level increase in the inverter, different voltage levels are made available by using DC-link capacitor banks, instead of using different isolated power supplies. The intermediate-circuit capacitor voltages which are not directly supplied by the power sources are inherently unstable and require a suitable control method for converter operation, preferably without influence on the load power factor. Apart from normal operation, the sudden fault conditions may occur in the system and it is necessary to implement the control strategy considering this condition also. A five-level inverter topology with cascaded power circuit structure is proposed in this dissertation with the strategy to eliminate the common mode voltage and also to maintain the balance in the DC-link capacitor voltages. The proposed scheme is based on a dual five-level inverter for open-end winding induction motor. The principle achievement of this work is the reduction of power circuit complexity in the five-level inverter compared to a previously proposed five-level inverter structure for open-end winding IM drive with common mode voltage elimination. The {{reduction in the number of}} power switching devices is achieved by sharing the two two-level inverters for both the inverter structures. The resultant inverter structure can produce a nine-level voltage vector structure with the presence of alternating common mode voltage. The inverter structure is formed by cascading conventional two-level inverters together with NPC three-level inverters. Thus it offers modular and simpler power bus structure. As the power circuit is realised by cascading conventional two-level and NPC three-level inverters the number of power diodes requirements also reduced compared to the conventional NPC five-level inverters. The present proposed structure is implemented for the open-end winding induction motor and the power circuit offers more number of switching state redundancies compared to any conventional five-level inverter. The inverter structure required half the DC-link voltage compared to the DC-link voltage required for the conventional five-level inverter structure for induction motor drive and this reduces the voltage stress on the individual power devices. The common mode voltage is eliminated by selecting only the switching states which do not generate any common mode voltage in pole voltages hence there will be no common mode voltage at the motor phase also. The technique of using the switching state selection for the common mode voltage elimination, cancels out the requirement of the filter for the same purpose. As the inverter output is achieved without the presence of common mode voltage, the dual inverter can be fed from the common DC-link sources, without generating any zero sequence current. Hence the proposed dual five-level inverter structure requires only four isolated DC supplies. The multi-level inverters supplied by single power supply, have inherent unbalance in the DC-link capacitor voltages. This unbalance in the DC-link capacitor voltages causes lower order harmonics at the inverter output, resulting in torque pulsation and increased voltage stress on the power switching devices. A five-level inverter with reduced power circuit complexity is proposed to achieve the dual task of eliminating common mode voltage and DC-link capacitor voltage balancing. The method includes the analysis of current through the DC-link capacitors, depending on the switching state selections. The conditions to maintain all the four DC-link capacitor voltages are analysed. In an ideal condition when there is no fault in the power circuit the balance in the capacitor voltages can be maintained by selecting switching states in consecutive intervals, which have opposite effect on the capacitor voltages. This is called the open loop control of DC-link capacitor voltage balancing, since the capacitor voltages are not sensed during the selection of the switching states. The switching states with zero common mode voltages are selected for the purpose of keeping the capacitor voltages in balanced condition during no fault condition. The use of any extra hardware is avoided. The proposed open loop control of DC-link capacitor voltage balancing is capable of keeping the DC-link capacitor voltages equal in the entire modulation region irrespective of the load powerfactor. The problem with the proposed open loop control strategy is that, it can not take any corrective action if there is any initial unbalance in the capacitor voltages or if any unbalance occurs in the capacitor voltages during operation of the circuit,. To get the corrective action in the capacitor voltages due occurrence of any fault in the circuit, the strategy is further improved and a closed loop control strategy for the DC-link capacitor voltages is established. All the possible fault conditions in the four capacitors are identified and the available switching states are effectively used for the corrective action in each fault condition. The strategy is implemented such a way that the voltage balancing can be achieved without affecting the output fundamental voltage. The proposed five-level inverter structure presented in this thesis is based on a previous work, where a five-level inverter structure is proposed for the open-end winding induction motor. In that previous work 48 switches are used for the realization of the power circuit. It is observed that all the available switching states in this previous work are not used for any of the performance requirement of CMV elimination or DC-link voltage balancing. So, in this proposed work, the power circuit is optimized by reducing some of the switches, keeping the performance of the inverter same as the power circuit proposed in the previous work. The five-level inverter proposed in this thesis used 36 switches and the number of switching states is also reduced. But, the available switching states are sufficient for the CMV elimination and DC-link capacitor voltage balancing. The advantage of the modular circuit structure of this proposed five-level inverter is further investigated and the inverter structure is modified to a seven-level inverter structure for the open end winding induction motor. The proposed power circuit of the seven-level inverter uses only 48 switches, which is less compared to any seven-level inverter structure for the open end winding induction motor with common mode voltage elimination. The power circuit is reduced by sharing four two-level inverters to both the individual seven-level inverters in both the sides of the of the open end winding induction motor. The cascaded structure eliminates the necessity of the power diodes as required by the conventional NPC multilevel inverters. The proposed seven-level inverter is capable of producing a thirteen-level voltage vector hexagonal structure with the presence of common mode voltage. The common mode voltage elimination is achieved by selecting only the switching states with zero common mode voltage from both the inverters and the combined inverter structure produce a seven-level voltage vector structure with zero common mode voltage. The switching frequency is also reduced for the seven-level inverter compared to the proposed five-level inverter. The advantage of this kind of power circuit structure is that the number of power diode requirement is same in both five-level and seven-level inverters. Since there is no common mode voltage in the output voltages, the dual seven-level inverter structure can be implemented with the common DC-link voltage sources for both the sides. Six isolated power supplies are sufficient for both the seven-level inverters. The available switching states in this proposed seven-level inverter are further analysed to implement the open loop and closed loop capacitor voltage balancing and this allow the power circuit to run with only three isolated DC supplies. All the proposed work presented in this thesis are initially simulated in SIMULINK toolbox and then implemented in a form of laboratory prototype. A 2. 5 KW open end winding induction motor is used for the implementation of these proposed works. But all these work general in nature and can be implemented for high power drive applications with proper device ratings...|$|R
