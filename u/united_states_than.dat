5|$|MEPs in Parliament are {{organised}} into seven different parliamentary groups, including thirty non-attached members known as non-inscrits. The two largest groups are the European People's Party (EPP) and the Socialists & Democrats (S). These two groups {{have dominated the}} Parliament for much of its life, continuously holding between 50 and 70 percent of the seats between them. No single group has ever held a majority in Parliament. As {{a result of being}} broad alliances of national parties, European group parties are very decentralised and hence {{have more in common with}} parties in federal states like Germany or the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>than</b> unitary states like the majority of the EU states. Nevertheless, the European groups were actually more cohesive than their US counterparts between 2004 and 2009.|$|E
5|$|Since its launch, monthly sales {{numbers of}} the console have {{generally}} been higher than its competitors around the globe. According to the NPD Group, the Wii sold more units in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>than</b> the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 combined {{in the first half}} of 2007. This lead is even larger in the Japanese market, where it currently leads in total sales (having outsold both consoles by factors of 2:1 to 6:1 nearly every week from its launch to November 2007). In Australia the Wii broke the record set by the Xbox 360 and became the fastest-selling game console in Australian history, selling 32,901 units within the first four days of the console’s release. It also broke the 360’s Australian record for the quickest amount of time to sell 100,000 units, reaching the milestone within six months and two weeks.|$|E

Beebe was a well-known figure in the Roaring Twenties of New York City, and was friends with numerous other well-known figures of the period, including Fannie Hurst and the cartoonist Rube Goldberg. Although he was not physically handsome in the traditional sense, he tended to dominate every social and professional situation due to his enthusiasm, intelligence and charisma. As a result of his much-publicized divorce from Blair and his later marriage to Elswyth, he was also known for his stormy relationships with women.|$|E
5|$|Lepiota castaneidisca {{closely resembles}} L.cristata (with {{which it has}} {{commonly}} been confused), {{but it has a}} more rounded cap, lacks an umbo, and is reddish- or pinkish-brown, rather than orange-brown. L.cristata, which is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, prefers habitats where the natural vegetational cover has been disturbed by humans, or in the beds of rivers and creeks; in contrast, L.castaneidisca is found in natural, undisturbed habitats. Other similar species in similar habitats with which L.castaneidisca could be confused include L.thiersii and L.neophana; in contrast to L.castaneidisca, both of the latter two species have ellipsoid spores. The fruit bodies of L.thiersii appear from November through April, and grow scattered or in groups under cypress. It usually lacks the reddish color {{in the center of the}} cap associated with L.castaneidisca, and its spores are not as long, with dimensions of 4.7–6.3 by 3.1–3.9μm. L.neophana is a rare species, but more widely distributed in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>than</b> L.castaneidisca, as it has been reported from Ohio and Michigan in addition to California. It also fruits under cypress, usually between December and April. This mushroom is most readily distinguished from L.castaneidisca by the dark brown to blackish-brown color of the cap center.|$|E
