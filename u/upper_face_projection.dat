40|$|Abstract:- The most of {{the human}} {{emotions}} are communicated by changes {{in one or two}} of discrete facial features. Theses changes are coded as Action Units (AUs). In this paper, we develop a lower and <b>upper</b> <b>face</b> AUs classification as well as six basic emotions classification system. We use an automatic hybrid tracking system, based on a novel two-step active contour tracking system for lower face and cross-correlation based tracking system for <b>upper</b> <b>face</b> to detect and track of Facial Feature Points (FFPs). Extracted FFPs are used to extract some geometric features to form a feature vector which is used to classify input image sequences into AUs and basic emotions, using Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN) and a Rule-Based system. Experimental results show robust detection and tracking and reasonable classification where an average AUs recognition rate is 85. 98 % for lower face and 86. 93 % for <b>upper</b> <b>face</b> and average basic emotions recognition rate is 96. 11 %...|$|R

An efficient, {{global and}} local image-processing based {{extraction}} and tracking of intransient facial features and automatic recognition of facial expressions from both static and dynamic 2 D image/video sequences is presented.
