5|$|In the December 8 American Research Group survey, {{excluding}} <b>undecided</b> <b>voters,</b> Hunter {{was statistically}} tied with Fred Thompson for fourth place in Nevada. In Michigan, Hunter {{was tied with}} Thompson and Ron Paul for fifth place at four percent, according to a WXYZ-TV poll. Los Angeles Times columnist Don Frederick pointed out that Hunter's support in the polls came almost entirely from Republican men, where he garnered 6% among that demographic in the publication's poll from December 2007. Among women, his support was nearly zero.|$|E
5|$|In April 1985, Wilkinson {{formed a}} {{campaign}} committee {{in advance of}} the 1987 gubernatorial election. Relatively unknown statewide, Wilkinson was the first candidate to enter the race. The Democratic primary field eventually grew to include two previous Kentucky governors, John Y. Brown, Jr. and Julian Carroll; sitting Lieutenant Governor Steve Beshear, who would later win two terms as governor in 2007 and 2011; and Grady Stumbo, cabinet secretary for Governor Martha Layne Collins. Early in the race, Brown was the clear-cut favorite, while Wilkinson was picked to finish fifth. Wilkinson financed his own campaign and campaign manager Danny Briscoe suggested that he hire a campaign consultant {{to reach out to the}} state's large concentration of <b>undecided</b> <b>voters.</b> After a few interviews, Wilkinson hired a then-unknown political consultant named James Carville; Carville later went on to chair Bill Clinton's successful presidential campaign in 1992.|$|E

Of the 2016 Democratic National Convention, he said the following: [...] "...If you’re an <b>undecided</b> <b>voter,</b> and male, you’re seeing something different. You’re seeing a celebration that your role in society is permanently diminished. And it’s happening in an impressive venue that was, in all likelihood, designed and built mostly by men." ...|$|R
5|$|For {{most of his}} career, Peart {{had never}} {{publicly}} identified with any political party or organization in Canada or the United States. Even so, his political and philosophical views have often been analyzed through his work with Rush and through other sources. In October 1993, shortly before that year's Canadian federal election, Peart appeared with then-Liberal Party leader Jean Chrétien in an interview broadcast in Canada on MuchMusic. In that interview, Peart stated he was an <b>undecided</b> <b>voter</b> who supported Quebec federalism.|$|R
50|$|A poll {{conducted}} on August 12 showed incumbent Greg Nickels {{in the lead}} with 24 percent voter backing. While a significant lead over all other candidates, the <b>undecided</b> <b>voter</b> percentage of 26 percent indicated room for any candidate {{to take the lead}} in the primary held on August 18. In second place after Greg Nickels was Mike McGinn with 16 percent. And in third place, Joe Mallahan with 14 percent. The survey polled 500 people with a margin of error of + or - 4.3 percent.|$|R

25|$|Ney's {{opponent}} in the November general election was to be Zack Space, a Dover, Ohio lawyer and hotel developer. As of July 2006, Space {{was considered to be}} slightly ahead of Ney, with a large percentage of <b>undecided</b> <b>voters.</b> For {{the first three months of}} 2006, Ney blamed legal costs for causing his re-election campaign to spend more than it raised. For the April–June period, it was unusually intense campaigning in his rural district that caused the six-term incumbent to spend $52,675 more than donors gave him in the last three months, he said.|$|E
25|$|CNN's poll {{conducted}} after the debate found that 58% {{of those surveyed}} thought that Obama had won and 31% felt McCain had won. In CBS's poll of uncommitted voters, 53% felt Obama had won and 22% thought McCain had won, Obama's largest margin of victory of the three debates. A Politico poll of <b>undecided</b> <b>voters,</b> conducted over a 15-minute period following {{the completion of the}} presidential debate, showed that 49% felt Obama won, while 46% believed McCain won the debate. Among respondents not identified with either major political party, McCain was judged the night’s winner, 51-42 percent. Obama’s most important lead may have come among Hispanic voters, who said he bested McCain by a 50-36 percent margin.|$|E
50|$|Janeane, a {{conservative}} housewife from Iowa, is an <b>undecided</b> <b>voter</b> {{who wishes to}} find {{more information about the}} Republican Party politicians running for U.S. President in 2012. She attends the Republican Party primary in an effort to find a politician who can offer a solution to the problems she faces. Her situation deteriorates quickly: her husband loses his job and comes out as gay, and she is diagnosed with cancer. These and other issues drive her to question her long-held beliefs and attempt to find a politician who can offer more than sound bites.|$|R
50|$|Canvassing is the {{systematic}} initiation of {{direct contact with}} individuals, commonly used during political campaigns. Canvassing operations are performed for many reasons: political campaigning, grassroots fundraising, community awareness, membership drives, and more. Campaigners will knock on doors to engage in personalized contact with an individual. It is used by political parties and issue groups to identify supporters, persuade the <b>undecided,</b> add <b>voters</b> to the voters list through voter registration, and it is central {{to get out the}} vote operations. It is the core element of what political campaigns call the ground game or field.|$|R
50|$|Polls {{that show}} their results without {{disregarding}} those respondents who are undecided or {{said they will}} abstain from voting (either physically or by voting blank) have been re-calculated by disregarding <b>undecided</b> and/or abstaining <b>voters</b> from the totals offered (through a simple rule of three), {{in order to obtain}} results comparable to other polls and the official election results.|$|R
25|$|Nationwide, Ivo Josipović {{achieved}} 1,339,385 votes, or 60.26%, while Milan Bandić won 883,222 votes, or 39.74%. Most polls {{before the}} election were showing Josipović with a hefty double-digit lead, but never as much as 20 percentage points as he achieved during the election. The {{difference between the two}} candidates came as a surprise to many pundits and analysts for two reasons: the polls usually favor the more liberal candidate since left-leaning voters tend to participate in opinion polls more than conservative voters; and the fact that most polls {{before the election}} didn't include the votes from the citizens living abroad, which was expected to be a strong boost for Bandić come Election Day. Nevertheless, the final result is similar to the result of the last several polls when only the certain voters were taken into account, which may indicate that few <b>undecided</b> <b>voters</b> actually went to the polls in the second round.|$|E
25|$|The {{governing}} Labour Party had campaigned {{to secure}} a fourth consecutive term in office and to restore support lost since 2001. The Conservative Party sought to gain a dominant position in British politics after losses in the 1990s, and to replace Labour as the governing party. The Liberal Democrats hoped to make gains from both sides and hoped to hold {{the balance of power}} in a hung parliament. Since the televised debates between the three leaders, their poll ratings had risen to the point where many considered the possibility of a Liberal Democrat role in Government. Polls just before election day saw a slight swing from the Liberal Democrats back to Labour and Conservatives, with the majority of final polls falling within one point of Conservatives 36%, Labour 29%, Liberal Democrats 23%. However, record numbers of <b>undecided</b> <b>voters</b> raised uncertainty about the outcome. The Scottish National Party, encouraged by their victory in the 2007 Scottish parliament elections, set itself a target of 20 MPs and was hoping to find itself holding a balance of power. Equally, Plaid Cymru sought gains in Wales. Smaller parties which had had successes at local elections and the 2009 European elections (UK Independence Party, Green Party, British National Party) looked to extend their representation to seats in the House of Commons. The Democratic Unionist Party looked to maintain, if not extend, its number of seats, having been the fourth largest party in the House of Commons.|$|E

For the first time in history, India took centre stage in a US presidential election. Over 500 Print, TV and Online news articles saturated media {{in a short period of}} 3 weeks. The viral digital campaign, mass TV campaign and mass mailers touched over 96% of all Hindu American voters. In addition to paid media, earned media is estimated to be over 5 million dollars.|$|R
500|$|However, {{despite the}} large advance voting, {{the race was}} not {{considered}} to have ended because the <b>undecided</b> <b>voters,</b> whose impact was termed crucial, were still being targeted during the remaining few days. As parties and candidate issues were already known {{by most of the}} electorate, the remaining days were seen as important over [...] "image and force of personality". Jan Sundberg said that [...] "the more crisis [...] out in the world, the better for the parties in opposition." ...|$|E
500|$|March {{polls for}} YouGov and Comres showed Khan {{retaining}} his lead over Goldsmith, though by a reduced 3 {{percentage points in}} the Comres poll and an increased 7 points in the YouGov poll. The Comres poll also showed Khan leading in a run-off while neither poll gave any other candidates more than 6% {{of the first round}} votes. Both polls suggested that the race remained close, with the number of <b>undecided</b> <b>voters</b> comfortably larger than Khan's lead over Goldsmith. Meanwhile, Londonist criticised both Goldsmith and Khan for [...] "sending substitutes" [...] instead of appearing at hustings events across London. The official campaign began on 21 March, when nominations formally opened. The confirmed list of candidates was released on 1 April, revealing that 12 people in total had secured the support and financing required for a nomination.|$|E
500|$|Polls {{just before}} {{election}} day showed a slight swing from the Liberal Democrats back to Labour and the Conservatives, with most of final polls falling within one point of Conservatives 36%, Labour 28%, Liberal Democrats 27%.

The SNP, encouraged by its victory in the 2007 Scottish parliament elections, set itself a target of returning 20 MPs and hoped to find itself holding a balance of power. Equally, Plaid Cymru sought gains in Wales. In Northern Ireland the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) aimed to maintain or increase its number of seats, having been the fourth largest party in the House of Commons.

500|$|The second {{presidential debate}} {{was held on}} October 15 in Richmond, Virginia, and {{included}} questions from <b>undecided</b> <b>voters,</b> who kept the candidates focused on the issues. During his opening statement, Perot explained {{that there was a}} [...] "giant sucking sound" [...] caused by the rush of manufacturing jobs to Mexico. During one exchange, Perot commented that Democrats and Republicans were both to blame for the deficit, but that neither was willing to take responsibility. He joked [...] "somewhere out there, there's an extraterrestrial that's doing this to us, I guess." [...] At the close of the debate, Perot described himself as [...] "results... action oriented", and explained that [...] "if they want to keep slow dancing and talk about it and not do it, I'm not your man." [...] Perot took part in the third debate held in East Lansing, Michigan, on October 19. Throughout the debate, he plugged and referenced his infomercials. He criticized Bush's economic plan to start off the debate, stating that it would not balance the budget. He later remarked that he would spend $60 {{million of his own money}} to finish the race. Notably, Perot brought up the fact that [...] "both parties have foreign lobbyists on leaves and key roles in the campaigns." [...] After the debate, he ripped the media during a press conference, criticizing them for their use of [...] "gotcha" [...] stories and the lack of coverage concerning his opponent's foreign lobbyists. Former pollster Frank Luntz explained, [...] "When Ross Perot uses his head, he's unbeatable. He's focused, straightforward and compelling.
