The indictment accused Banki of violating the sanctions law, running an informal <b>underground</b> <b>bank,</b> and helping “manage, supervise, operate, and conduct” an unlicensed money transmittal service through which he directly or indirectly facilitated and violated the Iran sanctions. In essence, the charges against Banki stemmed from prosecution allegations that he, as an American citizen, had violated US sanctions on Iran.|$|R

Initially the focus of CFT efforts was on non-profit organizations, unregistered money services businessess (MSBs) (including so called <b>underground</b> <b>banking</b> or ‘Hawalas’) and the criminalisation of the act itself. The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) made nine special recommendations for CFT (first eight then a year later added a ninth). These nine recommendations have become the global standard for CFT and their effectiveness is assessed almost always in conjunction with anti-money laundering.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, on June 22, 2005 Cheng Chui Ping (known within some {{communities}} as [...] "Sister Ping" [...] or [...] "Big Sister Ping") was convicted for smuggling illegal immigrants and for money laundering in this case. Ah Kay testified against her during her May-June 2005 trial. Ms. Cheng became a snakehead, primarily as an investor. She charged up to [...] {{per person for}} the voyage from Asia to New York in the suffocating hold of the rogue vessel. Although Ms. Cheng provided cash to buy the aging vessel in Thailand, trial evidence showed {{that she did not}} view the Golden Ventures voyage as an important business deal, even though the gross take for all involved would have been around $8.5 million - if all of the immigrants aboard had paid or been ransomed by their families. She owned restaurants, a clothing store, real estate in Chinatown, apartments in Hong Kong, and a farm in South Africa. Evidence revealed that her main, multimillion-dollar business was an <b>underground</b> <b>banking</b> network that stretched from New York to Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, and China. On March 17, 2006, she was sentenced to the maximum of 35 years in federal prison despite her protests that she was forced to carry out the work by Triad gangs. The federal judge pointed out the inhumane travel conditions forced on the immigrants and her use of gangsters to collect debts and ransoms in justifying the sentence. The immigrants held in the cramped hold of the freighter were forced to live on a diet of rice, dirty water and spoiled food as it sailed on its 4-month voyage to New York City.|$|E

40|$|<b>Underground</b> <b>banking,</b> where {{money is}} {{transferred}} through informal rather than formal banking sectors, is a recognised {{method by which}} legitimate remittances from overseas workers are routinely transferred. However, <b>underground</b> <b>banking</b> has also long been regarded as a conduit for money laundering by criminal organisations and arguably by terrorist networks.

40|$|In combating and {{regulating}} <b>underground</b> <b>banking,</b> {{a choice}} {{can be made}} of roughly two models, the risk model and the assimilation model. The risk model {{comes down to a}} complete prohibition of <b>underground</b> <b>banking</b> combined with an active investigation and prosecution policy. In the assimilation model, <b>underground</b> <b>banking</b> is recognised as a form of financial services but at the same time, all rules that generally apply to financial services are declared applicable to underground bankers. An effort is made simultaneously to lower the threshold of the formal banking system. The international recommendations and legislation-in particular of the Financial Action Task Force and the European Union-take the assimilation model as their starting point, albeit that no or hardly any attention is paid {{to the role of the}} formal banking system. With that, relatively little account is taken as yet in the international community of the historic and socio-economic backgrounds of informal banking systems, their embedment in different cultures and the advantages of the services offered. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{research}} how advanced accounting software can be used by police detectives, financial risk specialists and forensic investigation specialists, who are responsible for the investigation and tracing of the reintegration of proceeds of crime, from <b>underground</b> <b>banking</b> into formal banking system (pro active and reactive money laundering investigation) with a view on criminal prosecution. The research started of by looking at the basic ways how proceeds of crime are smuggled before it is integrated into the formal banking system. In that context, the phenomenon of <b>Underground</b> <b>banking</b> was researched. Currency smuggling, Hawala currency transfer schemes and the way in which it is used to move proceeds of crime were discussed in detail. Thereafter Formal banking and the way in which proceeds of crime is reintegrated from <b>underground</b> <b>banking</b> structures into formal banking systems were discussed. The use of advanced accounting software to trace the point where proceeds of crime are reintegrated into formal banking were researched extensively. Accounting software and investigative techniques on how to trace financial transactions which might be tainted with proceeds of crime were discussed. Accounting software which can be used on office computers such as laptops were discussed and more advanced automated systems which can be used to trace proceeds of crime transactions in the formal banking systems were also discussed. In specific, the investigative techniques on how to use these systems as investigative tools were discussed in great detail. This research paper gives a truly unique perspective on the financial investigative and analytical angle on proceeds of crime and money laundering detection. Criminal JusticeM. Tech.

50|$|Stratton had a {{hard time}} getting started {{developing}} Independence mine, but once going, it was like an <b>underground</b> <b>bank.</b> Not only was Stratton rich, he was generous. After the Cripple Creek fire of 1896, Stratton paid for food and shelter for the thousands left homeless by the fire. He wrote a check for $5,000 to “Crazy Bob” Womack, the prospector who first discovered gold at Cripple, but was down on his luck. He gave $15,000 to Horace A. W. Tabor when Tabor was broke. However, he tired of having people pester him for money, and he became reclusive and eccentric. He drank and read a great deal, but almost never had guests or went out socially.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze how Dutch Public Prosecution’s press {{releases}} about money laundering and <b>underground</b> <b>banking</b> are received by producers and consumers of online news reports. First {{we take a}} closer look at how journalists (re) framed six official press releases in 75 news reports. It turns out that journalists do not regularly adopt the success frame that the Public Prosecution uses in its press releases. Furthermore, the role of the Public Prosecution Service or the police is downplayed. The moral message that crime should not pay receives no coverage in news reports. Second, we analyze how the news reports generated 276 online comments. We distinguish three ways in which online commenters respond to news reports; they (1) appreciate, (2) downplay or (3) condemn the authorities’ success. Commenters are particularly likely to downplay or condemn the police’s success. When a news report focuses on ‘underground bankers’, commenters often express a negative opinion about the effort to curb money laundering. It also appears that readers did not always understand the use of a term like <b>underground</b> <b>banking...</b>|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a preliminary study into what is commonly called 'underground banking systems'. As the conventional banking industry is increasingly being regulated many fear that criminal organizations may turn to alternatives, such as <b>underground</b> <b>banking</b> systems - or informal value transfer systems (IVTS). The methods for this project consistes in a combination of archival, legal and historical analyses with unstructered interviews with regulators, law enforcement agents and academic or other experts from the USA, Canada, Britain, France, Australia, hong Kong, Germany, South Africa, India and Russia. Attention is paid to: the origins of IVTS; causes for continued use of IVTS; where IVTS can be found; use of IVTS by criminals; extent, growth and concern; measures taken (in various countries); research implications; conclusions and policy recommendations...|$|E

40|$|Emerging {{technologies}} such as smart cards, electronic cash and the Internet have been heralded as {{the next step in}} the evolution of money laundering. Australian and international law enforcement agencies have however, found little evidence that these new technologies are being used in this way. Legislation and law enforcement capabilities need to be developed to deal with emerging technologies that can be used to launder money. The techniques used to launder money in 1999 – 2000 were much the same as those used in previous years. There is, however, a change in how the methods are being used to avoid detection. Concern about the use of alternative remittance and <b>underground</b> <b>banking</b> systems is growing. Australia is an attractive ‘host ’ country for these systems because of factors such as the multiplicity of ethnic backgrounds represented in the population, the nation’s developed status, and its advanced financial sector. If the effectiveness of asset confiscation in Australia is to be measured, national uniform guidelines for statistical recording of asset confiscation are necessary. A greater awareness of the importance of following the money trail in the investigation of illicit drug activity has led to a more holistic approach to the investigation of illicit drug offences: financial investigators are now an integral part of multi-skilled teams investigating such offences...|$|E
40|$|Money {{laundering}} {{activity in}} China emerged {{hundreds of years}} ago, although the concept of money laundering is recent terminology. The thesis {{provides an overview of}} money laundering history in China. This includes selected dynastic periods, the time between the creation of the People's Republic of China in 1949 and the beginning of economic reform, the resurgence of money laundering following the 1980 s, and <b>underground</b> <b>banking.</b> It explores the money laundering 'problem' and contemporary responses in China. This includes discussion of the external pressures exerted by international bodies and agreements, including the influence of the United States, and an overview of the domestic Chinese response to the 'problem' of money laundering. Data collection methods included reviews of money laundering cases identified in newspaper and journal articles, and court cases. It also includes twenty (N= 20) interviews with participants drawn from the fields of banking, police, security, entrepreneurs and members of the general public. These methods permitted the identification of twenty-three (N= 23) cases that were subject to systematic analysis, and compared against international evidence on money laundering methods and predicate offences. Using the generic AML structure of prevention and enforcement components (Levi and Reuter 2006) that addresses the international standards, an effort is made to assess the potential impact of the AML regime in the context of China. The work concludes with discussion of the major themes that have emerged, and it offers recommendations for AML policy and further research on this topic.

40|$|In the {{beginning}} of his article the Author discusses acs that necessarily must precede the money laundering, i. e. a so-called illicit activity of primary nature. For instance, these acts are: illicit production o f drugs and next trading them, illegal gambling, white slave trade, living on the earnings of a prostitute and giving her protection, illegal immigration, trading of radioactive materials or of weapons, etc., briefly - all acts committed in order to acquire dirty sums of money. Then the most popular models of action are presented by the Author. In a phase model three fundamental phases are specified: the first phase is a placement, i. e. a change of cash into so-called electronic money or other financial values with involvement o f banks, money exchange points, etc.; the second phase is a layering which consists in concealing illegal origin of such financial values through offshore or <b>underground</b> <b>banking,</b> international money transfer, fictitious companies, etc.; the third phase is an integration - i. e. the introduction of laundered money into legal economic circulation through investments, purchasing of securities, etc. Next the Author discusses other theories, e. g. American „cycle model” or theoretical task model by Ackermann. The latter focuses on following points: 1) aims o f money laundering: conversion and concealment; 2) possibilities of acting: off-shore centers, fraudulent companies, corruption; 3) factors o f assistant character: international factor, offshore factor, layering factor, factor of cashless payments system, etc. Final part of the article is devoted by the Author to the laundering itself and hiding of this process as well as to persons occupied with this job, i. e. the „laundry men”...|$|E
